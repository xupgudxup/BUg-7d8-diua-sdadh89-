While it can be tempting to use agentic AI for customer-facing applications, those tend to be complex, messy, and unforgiving of errors—not ideal for agentic AI. Back-end operations, however, are a better fit. A project at a European telecom illustrates what this looks like. Focusing on reducing the time and cost for service calls, the company was able to use agents to reduce resolution time by 60%, save more than a million euros on a recurring annual basis, and significantly improve the company’s net promoter score.",

    "description": "After giving everyone a free Juice WRLD skin a year ago, Fortnite is once again offering a free licensed skin to mark the start of a new chapter. Anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 at 6 AM PT and December 1 at 6 AM PT will receive a skin based on Yuki Yubari, a character from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill who didn't make the final cut of the movie when it was originally released.\nThis Yuki Yubari skin is free to anyone who logs into Fortnite between November 27 and December 1.\nBack when Tarantino wrote his massive two-part epic Kill Bill, it included an additional sequence that was cut before filming, in which Yuki seeks revenge for the death of her sister Gogo, whom The Bride had killed during the battle at the House of Blue Leaves. Yuki finally sees the light of day in Fortnite Chapter 7, apparently.",

    "description": "This may be the winter of discontent for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players. Activision has been notably quiet about the game's sales, and has yet to share metrics or statistics. There's also been an uptick in anger from fans over conspiracy issues related to the game's Skill-Based Matchmaking mode. That's led Charlie Olson--the creator of CoD's SBMM--to directly address some of those concerns himself.\nOIson--who spent a decade at Raven Software under Activision--shared a lengthy video on his YouTube channel that dives into how his SBMM is supposed to work.",

    "description": "In Constance, you play as the titular heroine. Or at least a mental stand-in for her as she explores the furthest corners of her impressive mind palace--a surprisingly beautiful backdrop for a 2D action-adventure game that delves into the trauma of burnout. Armed with nothing more than a paintbrush, Constance bashes and dashes through the physical manifestation of her decaying mental health and clashes against her inner demons. It's a narrative with memorable moments but not an abundantly clear throughline, and an adventure that makes a few missteps throughout. Still, when Constance slows down long enough to allow you to appreciate its splendor and think through its platforming puzzles, it's often a marvel to behold.",

However, to fill the time and relax for a while, Jung-kook decided to partake in some livestreaming on the South Korean app Weverse, which saw him go live for multiple consecutive days in a row to play some games with and sing some songs to viewers.\nHis game choices were quite eclectic. Fans wanted Jung-kook to check out games like Roblox (which he said he thinks he's heard of) and Outlast (which he claimed was too scary), but instead, he opted for the cute platformer Party Animals and the multiplayer racer Up N' Down.",

His memorable commentary on the game became part of NBA Jam's blockbuster success in arcades. However, Kitzrow has revealed that he was paid a very small amount for his work in the first game.\nWhile speaking with The Escapist, Kitzrow disclosed that he was paid $50 an hour for his work on NBA Jam, which was the same amount of money he made recording lines for Bally Midway's pinball machines. It wasn't until after the game was released that Kitzrow realized that he should have charged more.",
