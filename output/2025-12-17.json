    "fullText": "Titans defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons left no doubts so far in the 2025 season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBefore the season, some fans and media members had questions about Titans interior defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons. He was away from the team during the voluntary offseason portion,  preparing for the upcoming season, and there were questions about his condition and his leadership. He eventually showed up at the mandatory offseason activities  and appeared in the best shape he has ever been in as a Tennessee Titan, dropping some weight and getting some analysis on his body to make sure he was at his best. As we head into the last three weeks of the season, the Titans have not done as well as Simmons would have hoped, but there is no question that Simmons is the leader of the Titans' defense and the best player on the team.\n\nSimmons has been a man amongst boys on the field this year. He has been quick off the snap this entire season, putting immediate pressure on the opponent's offensive line. And although he has lost weight, he still has that incredible strength, moving offensive linemen while still using his quickness and hand placement. The result of him putting it all together and his peak physical condition has Simmons putting together his best season as a Tennessee Titan. He currently has nine sacks in only twelve games played. The pressure he is bringing is incredible, as he is regularly double-teamed and still finds a way to beat them to the quarterback. And he is doing this all without having another member of the Titans' pass-rushing crew that has more than five sacks alongside him.\n\nBut not only is he getting it done rushing the passer, but he is also making things happen in the run game. He currently has 14 tackles for loss on the season. And again, he is being forceful by using his power. He is standing up blockers, shooting through and shredding double-teams to cause problems for opposing offenses. The effort is there on every single play, and he is moving from sideline to sideline and chasing down plays. And more importantly, the attention Simmons has drawn has opened up things for second-year linebacker Cedric Gray, who leads the Titans in tackles and is third in the NFL with 144 tackles this season so far.\n\nSimmons’ effort and play have been incredible all year, and he will end up being a first-team All-Pro this season, despite the Titans' record, while also establishing himself as the best interior defensive lineman in the NFL right now. Simmons has been a bright spot and a leader not only on the court but also with his words this season. He has taken it to another level, and for the Titans, who are trying to replenish their roster, it is clear he is a leader who can help them back to where they want to be—a stark difference from all the questions about him before the season started from fans and media.",

    "description": "Aryna Sabalenka will face Nick Kyrgios in an exhibition match later this month",
    "fullText": "Former British number one Greg Rusedski has dismissed the upcoming ‘Battle of the Sexes’ clash between Aryna Sabalenka and Nick Kyrgios as nothing more than a \"gimmick\".\n\nThe highly anticipated exhibition match, scheduled for 28 December in Dubai, has garnered significant attention, with the BBC securing broadcasting rights in the UK.\n\nThe event draws comparisons to the iconic 1973 encounter where Billie Jean King famously defeated Bobby Riggs at the Houston Astrodome, a pivotal moment for the nascent WTA and women’s fight for recognition in tennis.\n\nHowever, world number one Sabalenka has downplayed the significance of her match, describing it as purely entertainment and asserting that a loss to Kyrgios, who has been largely sidelined by injury for three years, would not harm the women’s game.\n\nTo account for the perceived speed difference between male and female players, the court will be nine per cent smaller on Sabalenka’s side, and both competitors will be limited to a single serve per point.\n\nRusedski articulated his reservations to the Press Association, stating: \"I think it’s a gimmick. Billie Jean was fighting for something so important and she was really the catalyst for everything that’s happened in the women’s game to date.\"\n\nHe highlighted the progress made in women’s sport, including equal prize money at Grand Slams, which he believes is \"the right thing.\"\n\nHe continued: \"It’s not two serves, it’s not the real tennis. I just don’t know what it stands for. The TV networks have picked it up, but what is the crowd going to be like in the arena? For me, it will be a success if it brings your non-tennis fans to the sport and gets more people playing tennis.\"\n\nRusedski will delve further into the debate on the second episode of his new podcast, Off Court with Greg, launched this week alongside coach Ashley Neave and journalist Kevin Palmer.\n\nThe former US Open finalist believes their venture can offer unique insights in a competitive market.\n\n\"I’ve been thinking about doing a podcast for years. I’m not going to hold back, you can ask me any question and I won’t dodge it with a politically correct answer,\" he promised.\n\nFuture episodes are set to explore the upcoming season, particularly the challenge to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner’s dominance in the men’s game.\n\nThe pair have collectively claimed all four Grand Slams for the second consecutive year, creating a significant gap between themselves and the rest of the field. Rusedski identified three potential contenders, including Britain’s Jack Draper.\n\n\"I always liked Ben Shelton, being a lefty. Can he get the backhand and his court positioning better?\" Rusedski pondered.\n\n\"Jack Draper was in the mix for six months. Can he get healthy? If he does, the tennis he was playing at the beginning of the year was sensational.\n\n“Alex De Minaur impressed me out of sight, his work ethic and how much he’s improved this season. So you’ve got a few guys contending in there that can hopefully lift their level in the off-season.\"",

    "description": "Grizzlies vs. Timberwolves predictions and NBA picks on Wednesday, December 17. Jaden McDaniels carries the load.",
    "fullText": "The Memphis Grizzlies are putting the pieces back together, winning six of their last eight, but, in a small sign of maturation, the Minnesota Timberwolves have fared well when favored.\n\nMy Grizzlies vs. Timberwolves predictions will trust one of the home team's maturing pieces, Jaden McDaniels.\n\nI dig in deeper with my NBA picks ahead of the 8 p.m. ET tip on Wednesday, December 17.\n\nGrizzlies vs Timberwolves best bet: Jaden McDaniels Over 14.5 Points (-125)\n\nWith or without Anthony Edwards in the Minnesota Timberwolves lineup — and there is reason to expect Edwards to miss his third straight game with foot soreness — believe in Jaden McDaniels’ offensive development.\n\nThe sixth-year wing has cleared this prop in four of his last six games and in 13 of 25 this season.\n\nThen realize McDaniels’ current average of 15.8 points per game is a full 3.6 points higher than his career best; his 41.8% shooting from deep is leaps and bounds better than his 33.7% two years ago and 33.0% last season; and McDaniels’ 11.9 shots per game is 1.7 more than the career high set last year and 3.2 above than just two seasons ago.\n\nEven if focusing on McDaniels’ 19 games with Edwards in the lineup — but Edwards not being “active” in Tuesday’s practice, per Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch, bodes poorly for his Wednesday availability — McDaniels would be setting career highs in points (14.0 vs. 12.2), 3-point shooting (41.8% vs. 39.8% three years ago) and shot attempts (10.9 vs. 10.2).\n\nThis is who he is now. With or without Edwards, Minnesota has proven itself right in believing McDaniels would eventually become a multi-level scorer.\n\nWithout Edwards, it should be noted that McDaniels has averaged 21.5 points in six games this year, clearing this prop in five of the six.\n\nNaz Reid has always been a scorer, but he is still undervalued in that regard. Reid has cleared this prop in 14 of 26 games this season, including five of six without Edwards in the lineup, averaging 16.7 points in those six games.\n\nEdwards is officially listed as questionable. The best way to exploit that uncertainty is to target thoughts that could cash with him in the lineup but have a greater likelihood without him. If Edwards plays, both McDaniels and Reid can still pour it in.\n\nThat happens plenty. If Edwards sits, then this same-game parlay could come down to Minnesota winning its second home game this week.\n\nJaden McDaniels Over 14.5 points\n\nBoth McDaniels and Reid spend less time in the paint when Edwards is out, thus grabbing fewer rebounds. McDaniels has averaged 4.8 rebounds this season alongside Edwards, but just 4.3 without him. Reid, meanwhile, has averaged 6.3 rebounds this season alongside Edwards but just 5.5 without him.\n\nThere is value to be found here even if Edwards plays, but it escalates if he does indeed miss a third straight game.\n\nJaden McDaniels Over 14.5 Points\n\nJaden McDaniels Under 4.5 Rebounds\n\nSpread: Grizzlies +7.5 | Timberwolves -7.5\n\nMoneyline: Grizzlies +240 | Timberwolves -300\n\nOver/Under: Over 232.5 | Under 232.5\n\nMinnesota is 16-5 outright this season when favored.

    "fullText": "Fifa has announced record prize money for next summer’s World Cup amid the escalating row over ticket prices for the tournament.\n\nWhile the World Cup champions will win $50m (£37.5m), an increase on the £34.6m won by Argentina when they defeated France in Qatar in 2022, Fifa confirmed that a total of $727m (£545m) would be paid out to teams as the number of participating countries rises from 32 to 48.\n\nIt represents a 50 per cent increase on the total prize fund paid out to teams at the last World Cup in Qatar, and comes as tickets for the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico are up to five times more expensive for fans than they were in 2022.\n\nAmid a fierce backlash, Fifa subsequently announced a new category of $60 (£45) tickets that will be available for every game, but with those tickets available for just 10 per cent of the eight per cent allocation for Participating Member Associations, only a lucky few will benefit while the remainder of supporters will have to pay up to £5,000 if they follow their country through to the final.\n\nA statement from Football Supporters Europe said: “Following significant pressure from supporters, Fifa has partially relented on its ticket price structuring.\n\n“This shows that Fifa’s ticketing policy is not set in stone, was decided in a rush, and without proper consultation – including with Fifa’s own member associations.\n\n“While we welcome Fifa’s seeming recognition of the damage its original plans were to cause, the revisions do not go far enough to reconcile.\n\n“Based on the allocations publicly available, this would mean that at best a few hundred fans per match and team would be lucky enough to take advantage of the $60 prices, while the vast majority would still have to pay extortionate prices, way higher than at any tournament before.”\n\nAs well as the record prize money for the World Cup, Fifa said that all participating nations will receive $1.5m each to cover preparation costs.\n\nWorld Cup 2026 prize money (per team)",

    "fullText": "Philadelphia Eagles rumor from ESPN reveals possibility of offseason A.J. Brown trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles will have a decision to make on wide receiver A.J. Brown during the offseason.\n\nBrown is unhappy with how things have gone on offense this season and he has made that publicly known. That's something the Eagles can't love, as it draws negative attention and could create problems in the locker room.\n\nThat has led many to wonder if the Eagles could trade Brown during the offseason, and ESPN's Jeremy Fowler is hearing that it's a possibility.\n\n\"I have several candidates, but let's start with A.J. Brown. The weekly concerns about Brown's messaging — from sonnets to soundbites — must be taxing on Philadelphia's locker room, even if players understand the receiver's frustration due to the limitations of the Eagles' passing attack,\" Fowler said. \"Several executives I spoke to believe the Eagles could look to move Brown, who's 28 and still has prime years left.\"\n\nAccording to Over The Cap, the Eagles would incur a $43.4 million dead cap hit in 2026 if they trade Brown before June 1. The post-June 1 trade number is more palatable at $16.3 million.\n\nIs it worth jettisoning Brown and taking on that dead cap hit in order to not have him on the team and complaining publicly anymore?\n\nWe would say no, especially with the Eagles having a huge hole to fill in their offense if they do trade him, but never say never in the NFL.\n\nAs far as compensation is concerned, we could see Philly getting a first-round pick for Brown's services, but no worse than a second-rounder.\n\nWith that pick, combined with the eight projected selections the Eagles have, they will have ample opportunity to add a replacement for Brown to pair with DeVonta Smith, who will turn into Philly's No. 1 if Brown gets traded.\n\nWe've seen the Eagles bite the bullet with dead money to unload one of their players before, so we shouldn't rule out the same happening with Brown.\n\nRaiders rumor details Las Vegas' likely exit strategy with Pete Carroll\n\nJerry Jones highly critical of Matt Eberflus, making his seat even hotter\n\nDetails behind Jets' problems with Allen Lazard revealed after WR's release\n\nZac Taylor, Duke Tobin get Bengals job security update from beat writer",

    "fullText": "It is all to play for heading into the last game of the Women’s Champions League league stage, with top-four and knockout spots still up for grabs.\n\nOn Wednesday night, all nine fixtures will kick off simultaneously at 20:00 UK time as 18 teams battle it out for quarter-final and knockout phase spots.\n\nThe competition is now similar to the structure of the men’s competition where, after the league phase, the top four teams will automatically qualify for the quarter final. Teams that fall from fifth to twelfth place will enter a two-leg knockout play-off, while the teams in 13th to 18th are eliminated.\n\nGoing into the final matchday, ten teams have already secured a spot at least in the play-offs, including all the English sides. But it remains to see who will secure an automatic quarter-final spot. Just four points separate first and ninth and all the English teams in the competition are travelling away for the final fixture.\n\nHere’s what the picture looks like Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United:\n\nLast year’s semi-finalists sit third in the table going into the final game, just two points behind Barcelona in first and Lyon in second, both on 13 points.\n\nUnbeaten and only conceding two goals across their draws with FC Twente and Barcelona, Sonia Bompastor’s side look to be in a very strong position to bag one of the automatic qualification spots.\n\nOn matchday six, they face two-time champions and last year’s quarter-finalists VfL Wolfsburg, who are down in seventh and just two points behind them. They last met in the group stages of the old format in 2021/22, where the German team delivered a 4-0 thrashing against their English opponents.\n\nA win would cement Chelsea in the top four, and they will be looking to close out their European year on a positive note as they did in their final Women’s Super League (WSL) match of the calendar year against Brighton.\n\nLast year’s European champions have been making life difficult for themselves, and go into the final league stage match having suffered losses against tough opponents Lyon and Bayern Munich. They have nine points from three wins and sit eighth, only above Manchester United on goal difference.\n\nTheir match against OH Leuven is a must-win if they want any chance of getting a top-four spot, though their opponents will not be lying down, as they are one of three teams, alongside Atletico Madrid and Valerenga, who are in the hunt to avoid elimination.\n\nAlthough Arsenal have recently welcomed back experienced defender Leah Williamson from a long spell on the sidelines, they remain hampered by injuries as they are missing both first and second string goalkeepers, Daphne van Domselaar and Manuela Zinsberger, as well as young defender Katie Reid and winger Chloe Kelly, both with knee injuries.\n\nUnited, who reached the league stage through the qualifying stages this year, will travel to Italy to face Juventus on Wednesday night. Having failed to qualify for the competition last season, and only reaching the second round of qualifying in 2023/24, this is already United’s best run in Europe.\n\nEven with a win, a lot of other results would have to swing in their favour for Marc Skinner’s side to get an automatic quarter final spot. However three points would go a long way to securing them a seeded place in the knockout play-offs.\n\nThis would guarantee them (in theory) an easier opponent in the knockout phase, and give them home-field advantage in the second leg of the tie. They will need to tighten up their defence however, as Juve have scored 13 in the league stage, and Man Utd have conceded nine while only scoring six.",

    "description": "The Omaha native, known as “Bud”, compiled a 42-0-0 record over the course of his 17-year career",
    "fullText": "After scoring a much-publicized victory over Canelo Alvarez in September to cap a sterling undefeated career, legendary boxer and multiple-time champion Terence Crawford has retired.\n\nThe Omaha native, known as “Bud”, compiled a 42-0-0 record over the course of his 17-year career. Crawford, who ESPN said “belongs in the conversation of the greatest fighters of all time,” won title belts in five divisions.\n\nAlong with those titles and his undefeated record, Crawford earned tens of millions of dollars in fight purses, although the exact dollar amount isn’t known.\n\n“Every fighter know this moment will come,” Crawford said in a retirement video posted to social media Tuesday. “We just never know when.”\n\nNailing down how many punches Crawford has landed over his career is an inexact science. However, boxing data site CompuBox notes that Crawford landed an average of 13.2 punches per round.\n\nThe fighter boxed 257 rounds, according to boxing records site BoxRec.\n\nLike his punches landed, Crawford’s total career purse is difficult to pin down. Still, The Sporting News noted he earned around $40 million before taking home an alleged (and disputed) $50 million from his Alvarez fight, putting his career total at a conservative $90 million.\n\nAs for the number of punches that connected over his career, Crawford’s 13.2 punches landed per round, multiplied by the pro rounds he fought during his career (257), totals an estimated 3,392 punches.\n\nBased on a career purse of $90 million, here’s a breakdown of how much Crawford earned, on average, across several metrics:\n\nPer fight: $2,142,857 (average is skewed by larger purses late in Crawford’s career).\n\nFor comparison, the Census Bureau found that the average American household earned a median income of $83,730.\n\nOver the course of his career, Crawford earned the median household income every four punches, on average. Based on his per-round punch average, the talented fighter brought home more than four times the median U.S. household income every round he boxed. And, per fight, Crawford generated more than 25 times the median household income.\n\nWhile the typical household will never make as much over its lifetime as Crawford averaged in three fights, it does have one advantage: It probably doesn’t have to take punches to earn a living.",

    "description": "The freefall for the Cardinals continues.",
    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals suffered another blowout loss on Sunday. This time, it was not to an NFC West opponent. It was a 40-20 road loss to the Houston Texans. They have now lost six games in a row and 11 of their last 12.\n\nAnd in new NFL power rankings for Week 16 by USA TODAY's Nate Davis, they have fallen, which is understandable.\n\nWhere do the Cardinals rank this week?\n\nThe Cardinals now are No. 25, two behind where they were a week ago.\n\nTE Trey McBride and WR Michael Wilson are the only NFL players with at least 40 receptions since Week 11 (both have 44 during that span). Despite all their efforts, the Cards are 0-5 during that stretch.\n\nWe can add to that. Jacoby Brissett has 18 touchdown passes in nine starts. However, they are 1-5.\n\nThey have played six games since head coach Jonathan Gannon said that Brissett would have remained the starter even if Kyler Murray were healthy. They are 0-6 with a minus-95 point differential.\n\nSo it's a weird situation. Brissett's numbers look impressive on the surface. He is getting the ball to McBride and Wilson, who has gotten looks as the No. 1 receiver with Marvin Harrison Jr. missing four of the last five games. Those are good things, they also happen while the Cardinals are trailing by multiple scores. They have lost by three or more scores in four of their last six games.\n\nWhile they play the 5-9 Atlanta Falcons this week and the 4-10 Cincinnati Bengals next week, it still is hard to believe that the Cardinals will win any games the rest of the season.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "Dec. 17 (UPI) -- The New York Knicks trailed by as many as 11 points before rallying past Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs to win the 2025 NBA Cup.\n\nOG Anunoby and Jalen Brunson scored 28 and 25 points, respectively, in the 124-113 victory Tuesday in Las Vegas. The Knicks outscored the Spurs 35-19 in the fourth quarter of the comeback win.\n\n\"I'm very excited,\" Brunson, who won NBA Cup MVP honors, told reporters. \"It's a goal of ours that we get to check off. It's an important stepping stone for us. We can still learn and get better from this game.\n\n\"I'm very thankful for the opportunity we presented ourselves. Through the ups and downs of the game, being up 10 and being down 10, we found a way to win.\"\n\nKnicks players -- who have standard contracts -- will receive $530,933 apiece for making it to and winning the tournament finale. Spurs players will receive $212,373 apiece for their NBA Cup run.\n\nThe Knicks went on a 7-2 run off the opening tip off. The Spurs responded with a surge of nine consecutive points to take their first lead and get back in the game. They carried a 30-28 advantage into the second quarter. The Spurs outshot the Knicks 52.2% to 48% over the first 12 minutes.\n\nThe game remained tight through the second quarter, but the Spurs held a 61-59 advantage at the break. Anunoby scored 20 points in the first half, with 10 points in each of the first two quarters. Spurs guard Devin Vassell and center Luke Kornet totaled 12 and 10 points, respectively, in the first half.\n\nThe Spurs used a 10-3 run to take an 82-71 advantage midway through the third quarter. They carried a 94-89 advantage into the final frame. The Knicks scored the first eight points of the fourth quarter as part of a 15-3 surge to take a lead they never lost. They outscored the Spurs 15-6 over the final 3:41 to secure the victory.\n\nBrunson, Anunoby and the Knicks outshot the Spurs 45.2% to 26.3% over the final 12 minutes.\n\nBrunson made 11 of 27 shots. He was just 1 of 5 from 3-point range, but also chipped in eight assists. Anunoby made 10 of 17 shots, including a 5 of 10 clip from 3-point range. Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns logged 16 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nRookie guard Dylan Harper scored 21 points off the Spurs bench. Wembanyama, who also came off the bench, totaled 18 points and six rebounds. Spurs guard Stephon Castle chipped in 15 points, 12 assists and seven rebounds.\n\n\"We've got to enjoy these moments,\" Towns said. \"You never know when you'll get another chance to do something like this and be in this environment. Life is very unpredictable. We all, in this room, don't know what tomorrow has, but I know that in the present the Knicks are the Cup champions.\n\n\"I've got a bunch of amazing brothers in the locker room that made this possible and an amazing coaching staff. We've got to celebrate this.\"\n\nThe Knicks (18-7) will take on the Indiana Pacers (6-20) in a regular season game at 7 p.m. EST Thursday in Indianapolis. The Spurs (18-7) will host the Washington Wizards (4-20) at 8 p.m. Thursday in San Antonio.",

    "fullText": "PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2; Simogo\nA suite of iOS classics is lovingly preserved in this collection from the Swedish developer, early standard-setters of the meaningful smartphone game\n\nFifteen years ago in Malmö, Sweden, animator Simon Flesser and programmer Magnus “Gordon” Gardebäck left their jobs at the now-defunct games studio Southend Interactive to strike out on their own. Tired of the fussy nature of console development, the pair would stake their claim on Apple’s App Store, which in 2010 was regarded as one of the most exciting frontiers in games. Mashing their names together to form a portmanteau, Flesser and Gardebäck became Simogo, and a consistently wonderful and forward-thinking games studios was born.\n\nSimogo Legacy Collection represents the Swedish indie studio’s first seven games, released across its first five years. Originally released for iPhone and iPad from 2010 to 2015, Apple’s constantly changing standards meant that Simogo, like all iOS developers, had to either regularly update their games to comply with the latest specifications, or see their games rendered unplayable. The only solutions are either to perpetually issue updates, or find a way to bring the mobile game experience to other platforms.\n\nThank goodness Simogo decided on the latter. Like all of the studio’s work, this anthology of games is smartly designed, its contents arranged on a homescreen made to look like a smartphone’s – except, you know, full of wonderful little games and not horrid social media apps. Care has been taken to make sure you can play the games no matter your setup – on a screen with a controller, at a PC with mouse and keyboard, in portrait or landscape orientations. (My preference was to play on a Switch, with the Joy-Cons removed to replicate the original mobile phone experience.)\n\nAnd oh, these games remain remarkable, all these years later. Things begin humbly with Kosmo Spin – a cute little arcade diversion, your only goal a high score. But Simogo’s ambition immediately begins to take shape with its next game, Bumpy Road, another arcade-style game about an old couple on a road trip, but infused with surprising whimsy and melancholy, a minimalist love story there for those who look for it. After this, the studio is off to the races, on an incredible streak of games that extends to this day – the devilish glee of Beat Sneak Bandit giving way to the melancholic, frightening folklore of Year Walk and the slick flair of Device 6.\n\nSimogo’s interests are wide-ranging and interdisciplinary. Flesser and Gardebäck have made a tradition of writing about the influences that inform each of their games, chronicling every project’s origin on their website. As a result, playing a Simogo game feels like getting a letter from some of your most eccentric friends, who, after spending a lot of time thinking about Patrick McGoohan’s The Prisoner, the work of graphic designer Sam Suliman, and Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, can’t help but write to you with a prose puzzle riffing on all these things using the typographic experimentation of House of Leaves.\n\nTimes have changed, and Simogo has expanded beyond Flesser and Gardebäck as their ambition has grown and brought them back to the realm of console games – such as the playable pop album Sayonara Wild Hearts, and their puzzle-mystery magnum opus Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. The brief, heady days of App Store brilliance are over; the world that allowed Simogo to flourish is now extinct. How fortunate it was that Simogo got the chance they did; that they’re still with us, and able to assemble this inspiring little collection we can play in perpetuity. These games, in all their varied playfulness, are full of longing: for a lover, for meaning, for a chance to write your own ending. Play them and dream about a world where it all went differently.",

    "fullText": "Keir Starmer’s office claims UK still in ‘active conversations’ about deal for tech industries in both countries to cooperate\n\nDowning Street insists the $40bn Tech Prosperity Deal between the US and UK that is on hold is not permanently stalled. The BBC reported on Tuesday evening that the prime minister’s office claimed that the UK remains in “active conversations with US counterparts at all levels of government” about the wide-ranging deal for the technology industries in both countries to cooperate.\n\nThe agreement, previously billed as historic, was paused after the US accused the UK of failing to lower trade barriers, including a digital services tax on US tech companies and food safety rules that limit the export of some agricultural products. The New York Times first reported British confirmation that negotiations had stalled.\n\n“We look forward to resuming work on this partnership as quickly as possible,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement. She added that the UK government is committed to ensuring a “bond” with the US “and working together to help shape the emerging technologies of the future”.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTuesday’s developments come as relations between the US and the EU are likewise chilling. The Trump administration threatened European tech firms on Tuesday with economic penalties if the EU refused to roll back what it called “discriminatory actions”. The Office of the US Trade Representative accused the EU and some member states of “discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives against U.S. services”.\n\nThe Trade Representative’s office said in a post on Twitter/X that these companies could face fees and restrictions on foreign services. The bureau singled out European companies, including Accenture, DHL, Spotify and Siemens as being able to “operate freely in the United States for decades, benefitting from access to our market and consumers on a level playing field.\n\n“If the E.U. and E.U. Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said on X.\n\nThomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, responded by stressing that their rules “apply equally and fairly to all companies” operating in the region, according to the New York Times. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination,” he said.\n\nThe retaliation by the US follows a $140m fine slapped on Elon Musk’s X social media platform for violating transparency rules under the Digital Services Act. EU regulators took issue with the “deceptive design of X’s ‘blue checkmark’,” “lack of transparency of X’s ads repository” and “failure to provide researchers access to public data”. The EU has proven much more willing than the US to regulate, investigate and penalize tech giants, a point of contention with the Trump administration.",

    "fullText": "Family members can be sweet and relentless but how can we aid our relatives in the age of new tech and device addiction\n\nDon’t get The Long Wave delivered to your inbox? \nI don’t want to sound dramatic but, a few weeks ago, something happened that has completely changed how I view online material. I fell for AI-generated content. For someone who is constantly squabbling with older relatives about how little they question what they see online, this was a profoundly unsettling and humbling experience. And it made me think about how, during this holiday period, we could all use this as an opportunity to approach those conversations with the “WhatsApp aunties” more sensitively.\n\nFrom ‘WhatsApp Aunties’ to ‘AI Aunties’\n\nI think I have the perfect sample of WhatsApp aunties. Sadly displaced from Sudan due to war, a permanently online group of women, some direct aunts, some not, but all aunties nonetheless, sit in a control room of sorts in their different cities and send out daily broadcasts that simulate as much as possible the interactions and updates they would have shared had they still been living in the same place. They even have office hours. One can divine the start of the day in their respective locations as they clock in and the forwards begin: First, it is morning greetings, maybe an embellished picture of Quranic verses or a graphic of flowers, wishing you a good day.\n\nThen, the hardcore stuff. Snippets of videos from war zones back home, clipped debates between political antagonists, and sometimes entire YouTube episodes of interviews. After this news shift comes the lighter one (secretly my favourite): TikTok and Instagram reels of Arab celebrities with too much plastic surgery accompanied by scream emojis, footage from family and friend weddings across the world, captioned with love heart eyes. The stream is interspersed with the longest voice memos you will ever receive, asking how you are and telling you how they are with an introductory and concluding prayer session. It is sweet and relentless.\n\nAll of this is dumped with an abandon that suggests no understanding of or respect for phone memory limitations. Whenever my mother casually mentions that her phone is acting up and mutters something about no space, my heart sinks. I know that hours and hours of deletions of grainy videos are upon me. But most galling is how much fake content it includes. The WhatsApp aunties have become AI aunties. This was frankly a problem even before AI became so sophisticated, but it is now much, much worse. There is the harmless stuff; cats hugging babies or penguins feeding themselves with cutlery. I try not to get too agitated by this or point out that it’s fake. But when it’s videos of Taylor Swift endorsing the pro-Palestine movement, it’s impossible to let it slide.\n\nThe result is a series of exchanges that are both saddening and enraging. Aunties will either take it personally, like I am disrespecting them by implying they can’t tell what’s real or not, and double down. Or they will express genuinely innocent beliefs in the veracity of online content, imbuing the internet with the same standards of TV or radio they grew up with.\n\nTelling the aunties that something is entirely fake is like asking them to imagine a TV news broadcast is not real. Also, they are actually receiving news broadcast clips on their phones that are not real. You end up sounding like the crazy one, trying to explain that a living, breathing, walking, talking person is just pixels generated from prompts.\n\nIn a recent episode of Subway Takes, comedian Ola Labib said we shouldn’t try to convince elders that AI content isn’t real. Her argument: Let them have their little comforts. I kind of get that, what harm is it doing really? But there is an emotional element to it as well. Policing elders’ content feels to me like a manifestation of a deep-seated fear that they’re losing it, that their faculties are waning, as they succumb to old age and the bewildering assaults of new tech and device addiction. I think it is truly distressing for people to see parents and relatives increasingly become addicted to their phones and become slightly addled, a window into a sort of premature senility.\n\nBut there are social and political reasons too, for pushing back. Aunties (and, to a lesser degree, uncles) have a huge amount of disseminative power and a lot of free time. They wield a formidable authority, particularly in diaspora communities, both as enforcers of values, as organisers and sponsors of social events, and generally as gatekeepers of community interactions and upholders of norms. Collectively and individually, they are forces to be reckoned with, which makes disagreements even more challenging and fraught with risks of falling foul of powerful elders. But they are force multipliers in terms of spreading fake content that is politically inflammatory or conspiratorial, and when unchallenged, they contribute to the general degradation of the information ecosystem and its associated political fallout.\n\nSo, I would say talk to them, keep talking to them, but do it kindly, with time and explanation, rather than frustration and bewilderment. Maybe just acknowledge the content first before pointing out its fakery – a “really cool!” followed a little while later with a “actually, do you think that’s real? I’m not sure”. Also, furnish them with the “tells”: video glitches, lack of shadows, weird blinking. Bear in mind what the world looks like to them. It is a place that is changing too rapidly to assimilate how it is happening. Our elders are also, simply, getting older. With that comes all sorts of uncertainties and unsettlement; loneliness, loss of identity as work is retired from, and children age out of parenting. Exacerbating that are the vast distances that now often separate elders from their kin and peers. Online content and its constant exchange are about so much more than sharing information; it is a new language, almost phatic, for trying to connect.\n\nRemember that the tech is evolving so quickly that even the most savvy have to be vigilant. I now have to be on alert after admiring a song with album cover art, a music video, a richly talented singer and fantastic accompanying chorus. After days of trying to hunt down the artist, I was thunderstruck to find out it was all AI. It will happen to all of us. Welcome me to the aunties brigade. Please be kind. Break it to me gently.",

    "fullText": "AI promises to have far-reaching effects in music-making. While some welcome it as a compositional tool, many have deep concerns. Here are some of your responses\n\nAI-generated music is flooding streaming platforms, and it seems to be here to stay. Last month, three AI songs reached the highest spots on Spotify and Billboard charts. Jorja Smith’s label has called for her to receive a share of royalties from a song thought to have trained its original AI-generated vocals on her catalogue, which were later re-recorded by a human singer.\n\nWith this in mind, we asked for your thoughts on music composed by AI, the use of AI as a tool in the creation of music, and what should be done to protect musicians. Here are some of your responses.\n\nI have already found AI songs being added into jazz playlists and “radio stations” on Spotify. There was one song I actually liked, so I did some digging and found out it was a group with a generic name that had around three to five albums all released in 2025. Then I noticed the next track and the track followed the same path. It was really irksome. History, I hope, shows that people do value human flaws in art. Sometimes it helps us feel seen or not alone. I don’t understand how a completely computer-generated sound based on what’s come before could do that. Then again, some people fall in love with LLMs. I just think everything should be labelled somehow. Give people the choice. Make sure there are protections in place like forcing social feeds and music platforms to give consumers the ability to filter out AI-generated content. Casey, 37, Chicago, US\n\nThere’s no heart in music generated entirely by AI, and encouraging it is hurting the livelihoods of musicians. It is also very important not to call music made by AI “composed”. That word gives AI prompters far more credit and muddies the waters as to what composition is. The only people served by AI music are companies like Spotify, and major record labels who would no doubt rather not have to pay artists at all.\n\nAs for working with AI, I once recorded an album with my band and lost the stem tracks before we finished the final mix, but we were able to use an AI tool that could isolate certain instruments in the masters and boost them to get the mix we wanted. That seems to me an example of positive AI usage, and something that wouldn’t have been possible before AI. A composer like Ben Nobuto is also an example of someone who has used AI as a starting point for building real, human music. It’s probably too late now, but all musicians with work on streaming sites should probably have been paid as their work was likely used as training data. Additionally, musicians should be able to opt out of their work being used to train LLMs just like cookies on a website. Jon, 30, musician and music teacher, Switzerland\n\nI believe music needs a human component to be of any value. Music composed by AI has, from what I have heard, a big problem with simplistic or visible lyrics and a lack of emotional content.\n\nBut I am happy with musicians using AI as a tool. It brings professional quality recordings to those unable to hire a studio, orchestra or vocalist and so on. I have been writing songs for decades – in the 80s I couldn’t afford a Portastudio (four-track cassette recorder), so I used two single-track machines instead to play and record simultaneously. Now I can upload my songs to Suno (a generative AI program) and create new arrangements of them close to my original intention. It is great to be able to write for voices other than my own. Even so, some of my family and friends tell me they prefer my original versions. Mike Lee, 67, ex-photographer and teacher, Southampton\n\nAI-generated music is a copyright nightmare and is stopping creativity. We don’t have to accept it, and we don’t have to use it. The most irksome thing is non-creatives believing themselves to be artists, using AI to create and claiming it as their own art, when it’s an amalgamation of stolen work. Not sculpted with their own hands, not conceived in their own minds. Frankly, I find it embarrassing when someone proudly declares using it. Artists are already marginalised, but there is a kickback against, for example, TV slop, and a growing demand for audiences – in all forms – to not be treated like idiots. Artists are the answer to this, not AI.\n\nIf you can harness it to your advantage as an assistive tool, then by all means use it. The danger is to become reliant on AI. There should be a clear payment scheme, similar to PRS and PPL where AI shows exactly which items have been used to create. Or a watermark on copyrighted material. Nicole Vardon-Martin, 37, events and stage manager, Dagenham\n\nWhen social media and streaming services are flooded with digitally regurgitated stuff, it becomes harder to find the pieces with personal decisions behind them. I like knowing there’s a story behind the songs I get stuck in my head. I don’t think generative AI is the neutral tool many describe it to be, both because of its strain on the earth and because anything used by these algorithms has to come from somewhere, and keep coming, for what they chuck together to seem original.\n\nBlatantly copying someone else’s work doesn’t become “taking inspiration” because some software has mixed it around. Yes, there are musicians who use only their own work to generate “new” music, but in my opinion this is quite an insular and thoughtless way of creating. Generative AI will always, eventually, become bland without new content to sustain it, and more AI-generated work cannot fill that void. Charlotte, student, Cornwall\n\nIn my home studio I use AI to help mix and master music. I can see that it might be tempting to use an AI voice on your composition if you can’t sing – but why not go out to an open mic and see if you can find a real, living voice? Where would Burt Bacharach and Hal David be without all the brilliant singers who interpreted their songs? Who knows what a real musician will add to your music.\n\nI might be tempted to use AI to write a song but then I suspect my own musical abilities would atrophy and I would become quickly dependent on the technology. I don’t know enough about how copyright would work in these circumstances, but we need to protect human creativity and one way is to go out and see live music, commission people to write it, and to buy music directly from the artist if you can, avoiding those streaming services that pay very little and seem to be actively promoting fake artist profiles.

    "fullText": "Growth in the US economy – and the president’s political survival – rest on AI. The EU must use its leverage and stand up to him\n\nThe unthinkable has happened. The US is Europe’s adversary. The stark, profound betrayal contained in the Trump administration’s national security strategy should stop any further denial and dithering in Europe’s capitals. Cultivating “resistance Europe’s current trajectory in European nations” is now Washington’s stated policy.\n\nBut contained within this calamity is the gift of clarity. Europe will fight or it will perish. The good news is that Europe holds strong cards.\n\nThe US’s bet on AI is now so gigantic that every Maga voter’s pension is bound to the bubble’s precarious survival. AI investment now rivals consumer spending as the primary creator of American economic growth. It accounted for virtually all (92%) GDP growth in the first half of this year. Without it, US GDP grew only 0.1%. Despite Donald Trump’s posturing, he is on shaky economic ground.\n\nTrump’s political coalition is shaky, too. In July and again this month, he has been unable to force Senate Republicans to pass his AI moratorium bill, which would have prevented states from drafting their own AI laws. The Steve Bannon wing of Maga fears that AI will displace workers en masse, and is appalled by what children are exposed to on digital platforms. Maga voters particularly mistrust big tech’s political power. Tech is a dangerous topic for Trump.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has two cards to play that might pop the AI bubble. If she does so, Trump’s presidency will be thrown into crisis.\n\nFirst, Dutch company ASML commands a global monopoly on the microchip-etching machines that use light to carve patterns on silicon. These machines are essential for Nvidia, the AI microchip giant that is now the world’s most valuable company. ASML is one of Europe’s most valuable companies, and European banks and private equity are also invested in AI. Withholding these silicon-etching machines would be difficult for Europe, and extremely painful for the Dutch economy. But it would be far more painful for Trump.\n\nThe US’s feverish investment in AI and the datacentres it relies on will hit a wall if European export controls slow or stop exports to the US – and to Taiwan, where Nvidia produces its most advanced chips. Via this lever, Europe has the means to decide whether and by how much the US economy expands or contracts.\n\nSecond, and much easier for Europe, is the enforcement of the EU’s long-neglected data rules against big US tech companies. Confidential corporate documents made public in US litigation show how vulnerable companies such as Google can be to the enforcement of basic data rules. Meanwhile, Meta has been unable to tell a US court what its internal systems do with your data, or who can access it, or for what purpose.\n\nThis data free-for-all lets big tech companies train their AI models on masses of everyone’s data, but it is illegal in Europe, where companies are required to carefully control and account for how they use personal data. All Brussels has to do is crack down on Ireland, which for years has been a wild west of lax data enforcement, and the repercussions will be felt far beyond.\n\nIf the EU had the gumption to apply this pressure, these US tech companies would have to rebuild their technologies from the ground up to handle data correctly. They would also have to tell investors that their AI tools are barred from accessing Europe’s valuable market until they comply. The AI bubble would be unlikely to survive this double shock.\n\nMaga voters did not vote to lose their liberties and constitutional rights, and an increasingly authoritarian Trump who cannot deliver economic stability because of his closeness to a reviled tech industry is likely to be deeply unpopular in the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nThe balance of risk now demands that European leaders cripple Trump. They have learned from a year of abject cowering before Trump that such behaviour only makes it easy for him to push them over. The reasons for caution are disappearing. The extreme reaction of Maga leaders to the relatively minor €120m fine the EC recently imposed on X shows that pulling punches will not placate them. Trump’s “28-point plan” for Ukraine dispelled any illusion that European concessions would secure a return to US military commitment.\n\nWith its democracy now explicitly under threat, Europe must join India, Brazil and China in standing up to Trump.\n\nBrazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is an example of how to do so. He has been dignified and resolute in the face of extraordinary bullying from Trump. In a single month, in September, he proclaimed in an open letter to Trump that his country’s democracy and sovereignty are non-negotiable, countered Trump’s tariffs with its own and passed a new law forcing digital platforms to protect children in Brazil from sexual harassment and other online harms.\n\nThen he rhetorically mugged Trump in a UN general assembly speech just before Trump’s turn to speak. As a result of Lula’s refusal to be cowed, Trump softened his tone immediately. Lower tariffs are now expected after negotiations between the two leaders.\n\nTrump said earlier in December that he thinks Europe’s leaders are weak. He does not believe they will defend Europeans’ liberties and their hard-won democracy against him. So far, the response from European leaders is proving him correct. But what Trump does not yet understand is that von der Leyen holds the US economy and his presidency in her hands. She must have the courage to go entirely beyond any prior norms of her behaviour. In other words, if she grabs Trump where it hurts, Europe will win this fight.\n\nJohnny Ryan is director of Enforce, a unit of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties",

    "fullText": "OpenAI seeking to strike latest deal in its efforts to pay for huge spending on datacentres\n\nAmazon is in talks to invest more than $10bn (£7.5bn) in OpenAI, in the latest funding deal being struck by the startup behind ChatGPT.\n\nIf it goes ahead, the market valuation of OpenAI could rise above $500bn, according to The Information, a tech news site that revealed the negotiations.\n\nAmazon, which is best known as an online retailer, is also the world’s largest datacentre provider and its investment would help OpenAI pay for its commitments to rent capacity from cloud computing companies – including Amazon.\n\nOpenAI said last month it would spend $38bn on capacity from Amazon Web Services – the company’s datacentre arm – over seven years. The Information said that OpenAI planned to use Amazon’s Trainium chips, which compete with Nvidia and Google’s chips. It also reported that Amazon’s financing could lead to a broader fundraising round with other investors.\n\nOpenAI’s spending commitment on compute – the chips and servers that power its chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure far in excess of its reported $13bn in annual revenues.\n\nAs a result, the lossmaking company has been seeking further funding and has converted its main business into a for-profit corporation. Its main longtime backer, Microsoft, has taken a stake of roughly 27% in a deal that valued OpenAI at $500bn.\n\nOpenAI is also considering an initial public offering – selling its shares to the general public – in a move that could value the company at up to $1tn, according to Reuters.\n\nOther deals struck by OpenAI this year include Oracle spending $300bn on building datacentres in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI is expected to pay back roughly the same amount to use the sites.\n\nIn another transaction with Nvidia, OpenAI will pay in cash for chips and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.\n\nOpenAI announced on Tuesday that it had hired the former UK chancellor George Osborne to develop relationships with governments around the world and broker national-level AI projects.\n\nSam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, has declared a “code red” staff alert to lead a fightback against competitors led by Google, whose update of its Gemini AI tool gave it an edge over rivals including ChatGPT.\n\nThe Amazon talks reportedly include discussing commercial opportunities and selling a corporate version of ChatGPT to the online retailer.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment.

    "fullText": "Described as a “historic national effort” to “invest in AI-enabled science to accelerate scientific advancement,” Trump claimed his mission would address key challenges to American energy dominance, innovation, and national security.\n\nThis mission, Trump boasted, would be a game-changer to science akin to putting a man on the moon or firing the first nuclear weapons. By building “an integrated AI platform” trained on “the world’s largest collection” of federal scientific data sets, he promised, the government could set off cascades of scientific breakthroughs.\n\nAccess to such a platform, Trump imagined, would supercharge top US labs, powering AI agents to do tasks like quickly test hypotheses and automate research workflows to speed up discoveries.\n\nHowever, the mission crucially depends on strengthening collaboration between public, private, and academic sectors. And Trump’s order is concerningly vague on how those partnerships will be structured and funded at a time when many scientists have been sidelined due to a flurry of Trump orders earlier this year that eliminated their funding or removed them from their labs.\n\nTo critics, including scientists, policy experts, advocates, and historians, Trump’s order seems divorced from reality, given that he spent the past year attacking some of the very institutions the Genesis Mission would seem to depend on. Trump also seemed unclear about what can be achieved with AI and confused about how scientific progress is actually made, some critics suggested.\n\nAmong the critics was Arati Prabhakar, who served as the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden administration. Prabhakar told Ars that Trump’s crippling cuts to government science agencies, research grant funding freezes, and attacks on universities must be repaired or his mission will fail.\n\n“After the Trump administration has inflicted so much damage to valuable datasets and publicly funded research, the new executive order is a Band-Aid on a giant gash,” Prabhakar said.\n\nAlso skeptical of Trump’s plans is Kathryn Kelley, executive director for the Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation, an educational nonprofit representing more than 100 of “the nation’s most forward-thinking universities and computing centers,” CASC’s LinkedIn said.\n\nHer group is specifically dedicated to Genesis Mission-aligned goals, “advocating for the use of the most advanced computing technology to accelerate scientific discovery for national competitiveness, global security, and economic success.” And while Trump’s initiative could be considered “a step in the right direction,” Kelley told Ars that she shares Prabhakar’s concerns.\n\n“Many research institutions and national laboratories continue to experience funding uncertainty, program disruptions, and workforce instability stemming from earlier cuts,” Kelley told Ars.\n\nParticular pain points considered critical to address for Genesis Mission to move forward include reversing “impacts on staffing, ongoing research, and student pipelines,” she suggested.\n\nIn one prominent example, some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts targeting workers at the National Science Foundation hit hardest in the branch designed to accelerate technology development across a wide range of research settings in the US. DOGE slashed workers there simply because it was the youngest directorate at NSF with the most workers in transition when Trump took office. As courts weighed legal challenges to cuts, whistleblowers warned that Trump was aiming to politicize and dismantle NSF.\n\n“Large-scale initiatives like Genesis rely on highly skilled personnel, robust infrastructure, and sustained program support—some of the very resources at NSF and other federal agencies that were disrupted,” Kelley told Ars. “Rebuilding trust, re-establishing lost programs, and stabilizing the research workforce will be essential to make this mission feasible.”\n\nCritics urged that Trump’s attacks on science also included messing with government datasets that scientists depend on. Since Trump’s second term started, scientists have watched valuable data get censored or scrubbed from government websites. Some researchers have rushed to recreate datasets independently with the help of the Internet Archive.\n\nPrabhakar pointed out that some “datasets that could improve health and prevent disasters are eroding or even disappearing due to this administration,” while universities training “the next generation of great researchers and innovators have reduced or even stopped graduate admissions because of Trump’s assault.”\n\nWithout a massive undertaking to undo moves that critics have said undermined both US science and trust in it, Trump’s dreams of launching AI models that would propel a million moonshots could go down in history as merely hype.\n\n“Without robust data and research and without people’s trust, America won’t lead in AI,” Prabhakar said.\n\nFor people in the science community, it’s hard to square Trump’s aggressive cuts from earlier this year with the broad ambition of Genesis Mission. Frustratingly, the president demands that scientists make discoveries on his timeline, without acknowledging AI’s limitations or how his attacks on science could be driving away talent that could help labs advance AI.\n\nIn many fields, scientists are still exploring how AI can aid research. Trump’s order appears to politicize science by focusing on areas he favors—like critical materials, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and quantum computing—despite their limited AI applications or data-quality challenges. Meanwhile, critics noted that it overlooks areas where “supercharging” AI could perhaps be more impactful—but where Trump notably does not want to leave his mark—like climate science or vaccine research.\n\nIt also lays out aggressive timelines for results, demanding that the Department of Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, “demonstrate an initial operating capability of the Platform for at least one of the national science and technology challenges” identified in less than a year (270 days). Ideally, Trump’s mission will have generated significant discoveries in key fields within the next three years before he leaves office, his order outlined.\n\nPaul Josephson, a Colby College professor and expert in the history of 20th-century science and technology, told Ars that Genesis Mission deadlines differ from John F. Kennedy’s 10-year timeline to reach the moon.\n\nTrump’s order “shows tremendous ignorance of how science and technology work,” Josephson said. The White House is saying, “Tell me what your discoveries will be and how many there will be in three years,” Josephson said, expecting that “we can pick the places where we want discoveries and make them happen.”\n\n“That’s not anything like how science works,” Josephson told Ars, reducing Genesis Mission to “a vision without policy” and “a hope without funding.”\n\nTo Josephson, Trump’s order sounded “more like it came out of Silicon Valley” than out of talks with government scientists, seemingly rushing approvals of industry partnerships and incentives without mentioning what resources would be available to fund gutted labs or train the next generation of scientists. It’s perhaps notable that the order is DOE-centric and does not place the same emphasis on contributions from universities or national labs funded by NSF and the National Institutes of Health as it does on industry partners.\n\nKelley told Ars that “many public datasets are already being used effectively in research and industry” in the ways that Trump intends his AI platform to amplify. However, “there are areas—such as advanced nuclear research or emerging energy technologies—where datasets are limited.” And Trump risks reducing Genesis Mission to bluster by claiming that an AI platform could drive breakthroughs to the major challenges he flagged in the short term.\n\n“There is a real risk that the EO’s ambitious framing could overpromise what AI can achieve in the near term without addressing foundational data gaps,” Kelley told Ars. “That said, even partial progress in these areas could provide valuable insights, but expectations need to be realistic.”\n\nJust as important as asking where Genesis Mission funding is coming from or who the funding is going to, Chris R. Glass asks: “Where’s the talent coming from?”\n\nTrump’s order does not forecast that, only vaguely referencing support for universities training scientists. This comes, of course, after the administration revoked an estimated $1.5 billion in federal grant money in 2025. Those grant cuts shrank the pipeline for PhD students at an “unprecedented rate,” Axios reported.\n\nA Boston College professor who researches global student mobility and the impact of emergent technology on learning, Glass told Ars that Trump has notably left international talent out of his AI plans, despite the prominent roles that both “domestic and international scientists play in our current leadership” in AI.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, Glass warned that “America is losing research scientists,” who are seeking more stable environments to set up their lives and conduct long-term studies.\n\nAs the Trump administration has attacked immigrants, other governments like the European Union and China have benefited by offering friendlier visa systems to attract the best and brightest minds graduating from US universities. Of course, of the two, China is America’s bigger AI rival. Earlier this year, China began heavily recruiting American scientists spooked by Trump’s grant funding cuts, and Glass confirmed that China has continued those efforts with the AI race heating up. Meanwhile, Trump appears to be going the other direction, recently requiring a $100,000 payment for some skilled workers seeking non-immigrant visas.\n\nThroughout 2025, US universities’ ability to attract international students showed resilience, but “we’re on thin ice,” Glass told Ars, with that resilience “waning.”\n\nCurrently, the US “is ranked the lowest among top destinations for its safety and welcoming and the lowest for its post-graduation visa policies,” Glass said, noting that doctoral students must affirm that they do not intend to immigrate, even though the majority of STEM PhD students stay in the US after graduating.\n\n“They want to stay, and we want them to stay,” Glass told Ars.\n\nAnother concerning outcome of Trump cuts that could hamper Genesis Mission: Entire research groups at many institutions were “displaced”—removed from their labs and left to work in cubicles without access to their equipment, Glass told Ars.\n\n“I think scientists want to go where the best sciences are being done, but eventually these kinds of friction points and these hostile policies make them redirect elsewhere, even temporarily redirect, earn their doctorate in Europe and hope that the policy environment in the US changes,” Glass said.\n\nTo turn it around, Glass made several recommendations in his op-ed to help retain PhD graduates and create stable pathways for high-value talents. That includes suggesting that the Trump administration consider fast-tracking green cards for students in fields that Genesis Mission depends on, including AI and machine-learning researchers, quantum computing scientists, and semiconductor engineers.\n\nHe also thinks the US should “unlock the O-1A visa for researchers and entrepreneurs” by redefining what makes someone an “extraordinary” talent and creating dedicated “founder tracks” for international talent, as Britain and Singapore do. That visa is “uncapped yet underused,” Glass said, only approving 4,500 STEM candidates in 2023.\n\nWithout changes to the visa system, the US “risks redirecting those talent flows,” he said. “And like a river, once those talent flows get redirected, they are very difficult to reverse.”\n\nAnd it won’t just be international talents jumping ship, Glass suggested, but also possibly US scientists forced to continue navigating potentially more of Trump’s cuts and indirect costs in the coming years.\n\n“I think that’s the kind of thing that slowly eats away at someone’s desire to continue to do science in the United States,” Glass said.\n\nGlass told Ars that he expects the US to stay on a “downward trajectory,” driving away talent in 2026, which Josephson suggested “will damage science both for the short and long term.”\n\n“Many universities figured out a one-year contingency plan, but reality will set in if funding continues to be cut,” Glass said.\n\nCASC’s Kelley told Ars that like university international student recruitment, “the US research ecosystem continues to be resilient, but the gap between ambitious goals and the current capacity must be carefully managed.”\n\n“While the Genesis Mission signals strong intentions to invest in science and technology, its success will depend on aligning resources, rebuilding workforce capacity, and thoughtfully integrating AI and data capabilities where they are most effective,” Kelley said.\n\nA scientist might be best positioned to understand the nuance that requires, but Josephson noted that Trump tasked his Science Advisor, Michael Kratsios, with leading the initiative. Unlike prior officials serving in that role, Kratsios is not a scientist and has no PhD, earning his BA in politics. Instead, Kratsios has strong industry ties, previously serving as chief of staff for venture capitalist Peter Thiel and managing director of a company called Scale AI.\n\nTo Josephson, Kratsios as head of the mission—which “seems to be totally based on faith in AI and datasets to do everything”—makes the initiative seem more aligned with Silicon Valley ambitions than public good. That could be a problem since historically, it has never worked when governments attempt to “pick winners” or pass industrial policy with claims that “if we do this, we will come out on top.”\n\n“It’s a belief in AI as the cure or the panacea for all the world’s problems to ensure we’re a dominant technological power, but ignoring climate change, race, gender, anything that is important in daily life,” Josephson said.\n\nJosephson is also an expert in Russian and Soviet history, explaining that precedent shows there are “tremendous dangers” of governments controlling which sciences are funded. In some ways, he thinks Genesis Mission “smells of Putin,” he told Ars, warning that Trump’s attempts to hoard and censor science in 2025 have been “as damaging to science and technology in the world’s leading centers as totalitarian regimes have been.”\n\n“It reflects the general timbre of the Trump administration toward the scientific enterprise,” he suggested, saying that the president has embraced the “authoritarian view” that he “has the right to pick and choose which fields and which branches merit more support and which should not be funded at all.”\n\nJules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), told Ars that in addition to cuts, Trump recently “weakened federal agency policies (called scientific integrity policies) that were specifically in place to protect federal agency science from political interference.” This further threatens scientific integrity, Barbati-Dajches warned in August.\n\nUCS has tracked “instances of science being sidelined, ignored, or misused by the federal government” across “multiple presidential administrations” for two decades, Barbati-Dajches told Ars. And although their methodology was recently updated, the current Trump administration stands out, as “the rate and impact of attacks on science we’ve observed over the past nine months far outpace anything UCS has tracked before,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nAdditionally, UCS has documented “cases of the administration using AI in their reports and research that raise concern” that AI initiatives like Genesis Mission may promote dubious claims to serve “politicized” outcomes, Barbati-Dajches said.\n\n“This altogether paints a very troubling picture,” Barbati-Dajches said. “Scientific innovation and discovery are exciting, important, and can help inform federal policy and guidance. But as history tells us (and recent history even more so), science in the federal government needs protective guardrails to keep it independent and free from undue influence.”\n\nWith Trump pushing for rapid buildouts of AI data centers—sparking widespread backlash among Americans—Barbati-Dajches noted that UCS has documented his administration making “policy choices and decisions that benefit favored interests (including tech and fossil fuel companies) over the health and safety of the public and planet.” Genesis Mission appears to follow that trend, critics suggested, along with Trump’s most recent executive order threatening to block state AI laws, which many consider a gift to the tech industry.\n\n“And meanwhile, most Americans are clear they don’t trust AI and want it regulated—but this administration has opposed even basic guardrails,” Prabhakar said.\n\nPlanning to closely monitor Genesis Mission, UCS is keen to get answers to many questions, such as “who will have access to the platform that’s being created as part of this initiative” and “who will own or will benefit from the outputs of this type of program?”\n\nJosephson said that it’s unlikely Genesis Mission will advance much before the midterm elections. In the next steps, Congress will have to approve funding for the mission, as its broad ambitions, if supported, would surely require structure to continue across multiple administrations.\n\nTo Barbati-Dajches, it’s critical that Genesis Mission is “viewed in the context of [the Trump administration’s] pattern of anti-science actions.”\n\n“One of my main concerns is that this type of mission is being funded in the name of science and innovation when the administration has continuously and methodically attacked federal scientific systems since Inauguration Day,” Barbati-Dajches said.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Genesis Mission will amount to anything but hype. But Josephson noted that perhaps the most blustery part of Trump’s order was a claim that “from the founding of the Republic, scientific discovery and technological innovation have driven American progress and prosperity.”\n\nThe US only began funding research in the back half of the 19th century, Josephson said, “but the amount of money coming from the federal government to the sciences was limited until the Manhattan Project.” After that, the US emerged as a “leading scientific power” in the Cold War, not by racing for “global technology dominance,” as Trump wants, but by embracing science as a “national good.”\n\nAs it stands now, Genesis Mission’s biggest flaw might stem from Trump’s disdain for DEI, which fueled his attacks on science and universities all year, Josephson suggested.\n\n“Funding science and technology and allowing the scientific community through peer review to determine what is the best science and to give funding to encourage young people to enter the science pipeline and to ensure that there are more women and people of color in the scientific community, so that more and more brains are taking part—there’s none of that in the Genesis Mission,” Josephson said.",

    "description": "Who needs Rust when we have Fortran?",
    "fullText": "While I probably should be learning a language like C, Go, or whatever new trendy language the ThePrimeagen mentions on Twitter (OCaml?), I'm going to attempt to learn Fortran[1].\n\nFortran, which stands for FORmula TRANslator[2], was created at IBM by John Backus in 1957 for scientific applications and has apparently been popular for high-performance computing and benchmarking supercomputers in recent years. Fortran has had several subsequent releases since then; FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90, Fortran 95, Fortran 2003, Fortran 2008, and the latest Fortran 2018.\n\nTo understand what version of Fortran to learn/use, we first must understand the difference between fixed form and free form Fortran. The fixed form layout comes from the very beginning of Fortran, inherited from punch cards, and has odd restrictions about the column in which comments and statements are placed. The free form layout, first introduced in Fortran 90, removed special columns and added the ability to write comments wherever, and is what we'll be learning in this article. The compiler we'll be using is GNU Fortran, or gfortran. You can install it via Homebrew (macOS) with the gcc formula, or install it using a package manager for your OS. To tell gfortran that your code uses the free form layout, set the file extension to .f90 or newer. The following comment on the Fortran discussion board explains this well.\n\nThe .f90 suffix means that the source code is free format, not that\nthe code conforms to the Fortran 90 standard. Code that uses the .f90\nsuffix can use features from any Fortran standard. All Fortran\ncompilers recognize .f90 as a suffix indicating free source form, but\nsome may not recognize a suffix such as .f95, .f03, .f08, or .f18.\nSome users may have build tools that do not recognize suffixes other\nthan .f90. Most Fortran source code on GitHub that uses features from\na standard more recent than Fortran 90 still uses the .f90 suffix.\n\nComing from TypeScript, and before that, Python, I'm very used to (and comfortable with) modern — you might say \"aesthetic\" — syntax . Although I wouldn't say Fortran syntax is quite modern, it seems to avoid the syntactic sugar nightmares that plague beginners in other languages[3]. Take a look at this helloworld.f90 example below.\n\nOlder Fortran programs required the use of SCREAMING_CASE for all keywords, but in modern Fortran you can and it is recommended to use snake_case (you can still use SCREAMING_CASE or any other case you want though).\n\nJust from this small example we can gather that...\n\nThe syntax for printing is a little funky though. What is that asterisk doing there? The asterisk, aside from being used as a mathematical operator, indicates the \"default\". So for print, * means \"print to the default output channel\" (or \"print to the default output file unit\" to be precise), which is typically going to be STDOUT.\n\nI can't find exactly where this is documented but you don't actually need the start and end program <program-name>; you could write a hello world program like this, though as I just mentioned this doesn't seem to be a common practice and isn't really very useful in any practical scenario.\n\nHere's another, slightly more complicated example.\n\nStarting right at the top, we have something new: implicit none. Added in Fortran 90, implicit none disables implicit typing defaults and all variables must be explicitly declared. In Fortran, implicit typing is the practice of assigning default types to variables based on the character a variable name begins with. Variables starting with I through N are INTEGERs, everything else is REAL. It is \"a legacy of the past\" and usage of an implicit none statement is \"strongly advised\" (implicit none - Fortran Wiki).\n\nA common Fortran joke goes along the lines of “GOD is REAL, unless declared INTEGER\"[4] because of implicit typing!\n\nMoving on, we declare our first variables in this program.\n\nHere we are declaring x, y, and answer with the REAL type, and choice with the CHARACTER type. The REAL type stores floating point numbers[5], and CHARACTER... stores characters.\n\nNext, we prompt the user for our x and y values.\n\nNotice how we can take input from the user with read and assign it to a value with the read *, <variable> syntax. The asterisk here means read from the default input channel/file unit, which would be STDIN.\n\nWe do the same for prompting the user to select an operation.\n\nFinally, we use a series of basic if-statements to calculate our answer and display it in the terminal.\n\nIf we run this, we- wait. Did I even tell you how to compile a Fortran program yet?\n\nFirst, compile our calculator program with gfortran -o calculator calculator.f90 . Then you can run it with ./calculator. If you only instruct gfortran of the input file (gfortran calculator.f90), the default output executable will be named a.out.\n\nOur calculator isn't perfect yet though. What if the user tries to divide by zero?\n\nProbably not the answer you expected. Let's try to fix that.\n\nHere we use the inequality operator, /=, to check if the y value is zero. Now, if the user tries to divide by zero, we'll print an error message and use the stop statement to end the program.\n\nGreat. We got rid of the zero division mess, but our code isn't pretty at all. Who wants a bunch of if statements? We can simplify this using the select case statement (also known as the case statement).\n\nThis also has the handy benefit of telling the user if they made an invalid choice while selecting the operation.\n\nThat’s just a quick introduction to a few modern Fortran features: declaring variables, printing and reading to and from the terminal, if and select case, and stop. Next time, we’ll talk more about where Fortran is actually used, cooler things you can build with it, and how the Fortran language & community are rapidly modernizing!\n\nIronically, in the ~3-ish months since I started writing this article, ThePrimagen has recently said he \"take[s] back everything i said about FORTRAN\" — apparently having some interest in the language! ↩︎\n\nAccording to sources listed on Fortran's Wikipedia, the name might also have stood for Formula Translating System or just Formula Translation. ↩︎\n\nSee The Rust programming language absolutely positively sucks : r/rust and Rust is a nightmare to learn coming from Java - community - The Rust Programming Language Forum. ↩︎\n\nThe first letter of \"GOD\", a \"G\", is not within I through N and is therefore of the REAL type (\"GOD is REAL\"). ↩︎\n\nYou can also use double precision for larger (more precise) floating point numbers. ↩︎",

    "description": "Stupidity is eternal—and more complex than we think.",
    "fullText": "I felt stupid, obviously—so stupid that, afterward, I could barely concentrate on the heavy weights I was lifting. That could have led to another stupid mistake. Thankfully, a few minutes later, my mood shifted when it occurred to me that I could use the incident to start my column. That’s how stupidity often is—causing problems, but also presenting opportunities. My stupid act had been a useful one, at least to me. To put it differently, I had discovered that I was smart enough to make something out of having been dumb.\n\nStupidity is surprising: this is the main idea in “A Short History of Stupidity,” by the accomplished British critic Stuart Jeffries. It’s easy to be stupid about stupidity, Jeffries argues—to assume that we know what counts as stupid and who is acting stupidly. Stupidity is, more than anything else, familiar. (Jeffries quotes Arthur Schopenhauer, who wrote that “the wise in all ages have always said the same thing, and the fools, who at all times form the immense majority, have in their way, too, acted alike, and done just the opposite; and so it will continue.”) But it’s also the case, in Jeffries’s view, that “stupidity evolves, that it mutates and thereby eludes extinction.” It’s possible to write a history of stupidity only because new kinds are always being invented.\n\nJeffries begins in antiquity, with the ancient Greek philosophers, who distinguished between being ignorant—which was perfectly normal, and not all that shameful—and being stupid, which involved an unwillingness to acknowledge and attempt to overcome one’s (ultimately insurmountable) cognitive and empirical limitations. A non-stupid person, from this perspective, is someone who’s open to walking a “path of self-humiliation” from unknowing ignorance to self-conscious ignorance. He might even welcome that experience, seeing it as the start of a longer journey of learning. (To maintain this good attitude, it’s helpful to remember that stupidity is often “domain-specific”: even if we’re stupid in some areas of life, Jeffries notes, we’re capable in others.)\n\nToday, we still object to what might be called Socratic stupidity: we’re appalled, for instance, by Donald Trump going over the heads of his scientific advisers to suggest that injections of disinfectants might treat COVID. And yet many other kinds of stupidity endure. Jeffries explores “Eastern stupidity” (in his telling, Buddhists warn of the wrongheadedness that can emerge from pointless and ego-driven intellectual argument) and “Renaissance stupidity” (for Shakespeare, “folly” could be “a mask behind which true wisdom conceals itself”).The notion “that folly, and perhaps even stupidity, are desirable” has often been “incendiary,” Jeffries writes, and yet it persists in our sense that true cleverness might involve a mixture of smarts and stupidity, the latter acting as an antidote to “the blindness of reason.”",

    "description": "Even though the in-game world is fairly small compared to Earth, I want it to feel big. Part of that is being able to see things that are far away.",
    "fullText": "▾ Previous: Around The World, Part 27: Planting trees\n\nFri, 12 Dec 2025 by Thomas ten Cate · Comments\n\n Game Development, Around the World\n\nEven though the in-game world is fairly small compared to Earth, I want it to feel big. Part of that is being able to see things that are far away.\n\nFor context: by now, I have settled on a third-person “chase camera” rather than a top-down view. It feels so much more immersive, and makes the gameplay (in particular, matching up maps to your surroundings) more interesting as well.\n\nRemember that my world is now a flat plane that wraps around, rather than an actual sphere. However, it would be great if we could still make it look like a sphere, so that distant lands would gradually appear over the horizon. Mountains would be visible from a greater distance, so that the terrain actually matters beyond just the shape of the coastline.\n\nUntil now, I’ve been using a view distance of 5 km. That’s still a lot compared to other open-world games! But a landmass at 5 km does not look very far away, because it’s so big. For gameplay purposes, it would be good if view distance could be increased to about 25 km. Otherwise, the part of the world that the player can see is too small compared to the maps, and they won’t have anything to orient themselves by.\n\nHow does it work out if we just look at the geometry? My planar planet is 512 km wide, so let’s pretent that’s the circumference of a spherical planet. Its radius would then be 83 km. Terrain generation is scaled down relative to the real world, so that the tallest mountain is about 2500 m high. Assuming a ship of up to 25 m tall, the mountain’s peak will be visible over the horizon from 22 km away. That’s pretty close to the 25 km I figured out above, so I decided to sail with these numbers for now: let’s fake a planet radius of 83 km.\n\nWe now have some problems to solve.\n\nTo actually be able to sail around the world, you need to be able to sail off the west edge and reappear at the east edge, and vice versa. That’s easy enough to implement with some modular arithmetic applied to the ship’s coordinates. However, any nearby objects and terrain must also exhibit the same wrapping: if you are near the west edge of the world, you should be able to see across it, so anything near the east edge would have to be moved near you as well. This, too, can be implemented with some modular arithmetic.\n\nHowever, it would have to be applied to every object in the game individually. That’s tedious at best, and bad for performance at worst, so I came up with the solution of parenting every object to a 2×2 km chunk. Only the chunks are moving around; their children just come along for the ride. The node hierarchy looks like this:\n\nHere’s an example of how a nearby NPC ship would become visible, even though it’s all the way on the other side of the map in world coordinates:\n\nThe chunks themselves take care to move their children to adjacent chunks whenever they cross a chunk boundary, so the code of individual objects doesn’t need to care about the chunking at all.\n\nAs before with the spherical world, we’re going to run into floating-point precision issues. Godot by default uses 32-bit floats for object and vertex positions, which have only 23 bits of precision; at 512 km from the origin, the distance between two successive floating-point numbers is about 6 cm. The official recommendation in the Godot docs is not to go beyond 8 km for a 3D third-person game, and not beyond 64 km for any 3D game.\n\nI started out hoping that this wouldn’t be an issue, but it turns out to be real: far away from the world origin, the ship started jittering weirdly, and the sails started jittering relative to the ship. A solution was needed.\n\nBuilding Godot with 64-bits precision is possible, but adds a lot of overhead: now every vector and matrix in the game uses twice the memory, including the large procedurally generated terrain meshes. Would that be a problem? Not necessarily, but it turns out there’s now an easier solution.\n\nSince we’re moving chunks around anyway, we can implement a floating origin system there as well. Just before rendering a frame, the chunk containing the player’s ship is moved to the global origin (0, 0), and all other chunks are positioned relative to it:\n\nThis ensures that every object we care about remains close to the global origin, where floating-point precision is sufficient. As long as none of the code assumes that global coordinates (relative to Godot’s global origin) are the same as world coordinates (relative to the north-west corner of the world map), this works great: the jitter is gone.\n\nLet’s take a look at how we could implement a fake planet curvature. In particular, I want distant objects to gradually sink below the horizon.\n\nThis could be done in a vertex shader: simply compute the distance to the camera (measured on the horizontal plane), calculate how far downwards the vertex should move, and move it:\n\nThe drawback is that this shader would need to be applied to every object in the world, meaning I would have to use custom shaders everywhere and couldn’t benefit from Godot’s built-in materials anymore. Tedious! Another drawback is that the visible meshes would no longer align with their physics shapes, which becomes relevant if we want to do object picking (e.g. clicking on the peak of a distant mountain to set a course towards it).\n\nBut I had an idea I wanted to try. Now that we have chunks, maybe we could pull the chunks themselves downwards, and have all their children come along for the ride?\n\nMy first attempt was to introduce some skew. In 3D games, the position and orientation of an object is usually represented as a matrix, and mine is no different. Godot uses 3×4 matrices: a 3×3 part to represent rotation and scale, and a 3x1 part for translation. But rotation has 3 degrees of freedom, and scale has another 3, so that means that we have 3 more degrees of freedom we can play with to make the chunk align (somewhat) with the sphere. Because chunks are in the y = 0 plane and are neither rotated nor scaled, the matrix looks like this, where tx, 0, tz is the translation vector (the chunk’s position):\n\nIf we want to move points within the chunk only on the vertical axis (y), depending on their position in the xz plane, we have two components rx, rz we can play with, as well as ty:\n\nMy idea is then as follows: modify these variables rx, rz, ty in such a way that the chunk’s corners end up on the sphere. Because we have 4 corners and only 3 variables, this is impossible; instead, we do it only for the 3 corners that are closest to the camera, and let the 4th end up where it will. It’s hard to draw in 3D, but in 2D you can see the idea better:\n\nEvery object inside these chunks will end up skewed as well, but because the effect is slight, this shouldn’t be visible.\n\nHere’s how it looks when I modify the curvature in real time:\n\nAt lower curvatures, it’s quite effective!\n\nHowever, there’s a problem with this approach that might not be obvious at first: physics. The built-in Godot Physics engine is well known to be bad at anything except pure translation and rotation; it doesn’t even support scaling. The newly integrated Jolt engine is better in this regard, but it draws the line at skewing, and starts emitting a lot of errors if a physics shape like a cylinder has any skew introduced to it.\n\nSo, let’s try something so stupid that it couldn’t possibly work: do not skew chunks at all, but just move them on the vertical axis, like this:\n\nAmazingly, at small curvatures such as I’m using, this works just fine and the visual difference compared to skewing is not even noticeable. You might think it would introduce visible cracks between terrain chunks, but no: because farther chunks are moved farther downwards, the cracks are always hidden behind nearby terrain. It’s a keeper!\n\nNow that we have the ability to make stuff gradually appear over the horizon, we need some stuff that actually will gradually appear over the horizon. With a ship of 25 m tall, even though the horizon itself is (surprisingly) only 2 km away, we can see tall mountains at a distance of 25 km. So a draw distance of 5 km is not nearly enough anymore.\n\nIt’s easy enough to increase this value in the configuration, but this increased the amount of terrain by a factor of 5² = 25, and tanked the frame rate. Some quick math shows that, at the terrain resolution of 8 m that I’m using, the 50×50 km patch of terrain around the player consists of 39 million triangles, and this is too much for my GPU.\n\nFortunately, we don’t need that many triangles, because on distant terrain they’re smaller than a pixel. It’s time to introduce a LOD (level-of-detail) scheme to our terrain: render nearby terrain at full detail, but reduce the number of triangles on terrain chunks farther away.\n\nA classic problem with this are seams, or cracks, between adjacent terrain meshes of a different LOD. It’s often just a few pixels, but it’s still quite visible especially in motion. Here, I tweaked some values to make the problem more visible:\n\nThere are various solutions. The most elegant is to introduce special bits of mesh to cover the cracks, which are only made visible when the two adjacent terrain chunks are currently displayed at different LODs. Due to all the different edge cases (pun wholeheartedly intended), it’s surprisingly fiddly to get this right.\n\nFortunately there’s a simpler method, which is to simply add a ‘skirt’ of quads that hangs down from the edge of each chunk:\n\nThe normals on the skirt are copied from the adjacent vertices, so they receive the same lighting, and it won’t look as if there’s an actual small cliff there. And with that, the crack is gone:\n\nThis should also cover up any cracks caused by moving chunks vertically, though I haven’t spotted any so far.\n\nThe trees I added in the previous post make a huge difference to the believability and sense of scale of the terrain. It would be sad if they couldn’t be rendered up to a large distance.\n\nHowever, as it currently stands, being near a rainforest will drop the framerate to about 40 fps; the tree meshes take 15 ms to render. Since I want this game to run well on potato hardware, it should run at around 150-200 fps on my mid-range Radeon RX 7600 card, meaning a frame budget of only 5-7 ms.\n\nThe standard trick is to not render full meshes at a large distance, but rather pre-render the mesh into a texture from various points of view, and then just render a single quad with the texture applied: an impostor.\n\nGodot doesn’t have support for impostors built in, but adding tooling inside the editor is really easy, so I built this quick and dirty impostor baking scene:\n\nIt iterates through all the tree meshes at 8 different angles, and renders each to a suitably sized viewport through an orthogonal camera (to simulate an infinite distance). Each orientation is rendered twice: once to capture colour and alpha, once to capture normals. The textures have pretty low resolution, but that’s fine, because they’re never viewed up close anyway:\n\nThese are then applied directly to the impostor quad, depending on the viewing angle:\n\nThis increased the frame rate from 40 fps to about 130 fps. There’s some more low-hanging fruit that will improve the frame rate further, so this is fast enough for the time being.\n\nLet’s see all of the above in action while the player sails towards a remote island: the distant terrain, planet curvature, and tree impostors. I’ve edited the video for brevity, because it ran over 3 minutes; one of the biggest game design challenges will be to make sure the player has something to do during these long voyages.\n\nThe transition from impostors to real geometry is still fairly noticeable, probably because the impostors cast a smaller shadow. But it’s plenty good enough for now.\n\n▾ Previous: Around The World, Part 27: Planting trees",

    "fullText": "GitHub is charging $0.002/minute for self-hosted runners starting March 2026.\n\nGitHub Actions is the default CI/CD tool for many teams on GitHub. When GitHub-hosted runners become too slow or expensive, self-hosted runners seem like the obvious next step. But starting March 2026, self-hosted runners come with new per-minute fees, and they've always come with significant operational overhead.\n\nThis guide covers GitHub Actions pricing changes, what self-hosted runners require to operate, and alternatives that might save your team time and money.\n\nSelf-hosted runners are machines you provision and maintain that execute GitHub Actions workflows. Your code runs on infrastructure you control (VMs in AWS, bare-metal servers, or Kubernetes clusters) instead of GitHub's virtual machines.\n\nTeams move to self-hosted runners for:\n\nSelf-hosted runners have been free to use, you only paid for your own infrastructure. That changes on March 1, 2026.\n\nGitHub is introducing a $0.002 per minute platform charge for self-hosted runner usage in private repositories. This covers the Actions control plane: job orchestration, scheduling, and workflow automation.\n\nThis fee applies regardless of where your runners are hosted, AWS, GCP, your own data center. You're paying GitHub for orchestration.\n\nPublic repositories and GitHub Enterprise Server customers are exempt.\n\nWith the March 2026 Github self-hosted runners pricing changes, teams have three paths:\n\n1. Stay on GitHub-hosted runners\n\nAccept the per-minute costs for GitHub's managed runners. This works if your build volume is low enough that the convenience outweighs the cost. GitHub is reducing hosted runner prices by up to 39% starting January 2026, which helps. But at scale, minutes add up fast, and you're still limited by GitHub's runner specs and concurrency limits.\n\n2. Keep self-hosted runners and absorb the new costs\n\nIf you've already invested in self-hosted infrastructure and your team has the capacity to maintain it, paying the $0.002/min platform fee might be acceptable. You keep your custom environments and performance optimizations. You also keep the operational burden: ARC management, runner updates, scaling logic, and debugging.\n\n3. Migrate to a platform that handles CI/CD and deployment together\n\nInstead of managing runners, use a platform where builds, deployments, databases, and infrastructure are integrated. You trade GitHub Actions workflows for a system designed to handle the full path from code to production.\n\nFor teams evaluating option 3, here's what's available.\n\nIf the operational overhead doesn't fit your team, here are some alternatives to Github Actions worth evaluating.\n\nNorthflank handles CI/CD alongside deployment, databases, and infrastructure in one platform. Instead of managing runners, you connect a repository and Northflank builds every commit.\n\nNorthflank includes preview environments with isolated databases for every PR, managed databases (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis), cron jobs, autoscaling (including scale-to-zero), custom domains with automatic TLS, secret management, and RBAC.\n\nPricing: Compute resources (vCPU and memory) prorated to the second. No per-minute platform fee. Free Developer Sandbox tier available.\n\nFor teams not ready to fully move away from GitHub Actions, Northflank integrates with existing workflows, keep your CI processes while using Northflank for deployments and hosting.\n\nEstablished CI/CD platform with cloud and self-hosted runners. Highly customizable YAML-based workflows with Docker, Kubernetes, and VM support.\n\nBest for larger teams with complex pipelines that need flexibility and integrations. No native hosting or service management, you'll need separate tools for deployments and databases.\n\nCI/CD built into GitLab's DevOps platform. Works with cloud-hosted and self-hosted environments.\n\nBest for teams already on GitLab who want integrated project management alongside CI/CD. Less flexible for multi-cloud setups.\n\nHybrid model: pipelines run from the cloud, builds run on your own infrastructure via lightweight agents.\n\nBest for teams with strict security or compliance requirements who need infrastructure control. You manage and scale your own build infrastructure.\n\nIf you want to keep GitHub Actions workflows but need better performance, third-party runner providers offer faster, managed self-hosted runners:\n\nThese still use GitHub Actions, they replace the runner infrastructure, not the workflow system.\n\nSelf-hosted runners fit specific scenarios:\n\nFor most teams, a platform approach is more practical:\n\nSign up at northflank.com and deploy your first project in minutes.\n\nGitHub self-hosted runners solve cost, performance, and control problems. They also require infrastructure management, autoscaling complexity, and, starting March 2026, a per-minute platform fee.\n\nNorthflank provides builds, deployments, databases, and observability in one platform. No Kubernetes expertise required. No runner maintenance. No platform fees on compute.\n\nManaging self-hosted runners is one option. Using a platform that handles CI/CD and deployment together is another. Choose based on your team's capacity and priorities.\n\nStarting March 1, 2026, GitHub charges $0.002 per minute for self-hosted runner usage in private repositories. At 50,000 minutes/month, that's $100. At 100,000 minutes, $200. This is on top of your own infrastructure costs. Public repositories and GitHub Enterprise Server customers are exempt.\n\nUntil March 2026, yes. After March 1, 2026, GitHub introduces a platform fee of $0.002/minute for private repositories. You still pay for your own infrastructure (VMs, Kubernetes clusters, etc.) separately.\n\nNorthflank is the best GitHub Actions alternative for teams that want CI/CD, deployments, databases, and infrastructure in one platform. Other options include CircleCI for complex pipelines, GitLab CI for teams already on GitLab, and Buildkite for teams needing infrastructure control.\n\nYou provision a machine (VM, container, or bare metal), install the GitHub runner application, configure networking for outbound HTTPS, and register the runner with your repository or organization. For autoscaling, you need Actions Runner Controller (ARC) on Kubernetes or a custom webhook-based solution.\n\nARC is a Kubernetes operator that manages and scales self-hosted GitHub Actions runners. It requires a Kubernetes cluster, Helm, and cert-manager. GitHub is deprecating legacy ARC modes in favor of the new Scale Set architecture.\n\nYes. GitHub-hosted runners are fully managed and require no infrastructure setup. You pay per minute based on runner size and OS. GitHub is reducing hosted runner prices by up to 39% starting January 2026.\n\nCommon reasons include build performance bottlenecks, scaling costs, limited infrastructure control, no built-in hosting or databases, unpredictable pricing at scale, and vendor lock-in concerns. Platforms like Northflank address these by combining CI/CD with deployment and infrastructure management.\n\nYes. Northflank connects directly to GitHub repositories. Every commit triggers a build, and deployments happen automatically to preview, staging, or production environments. Teams can also integrate existing GitHub Actions workflows with Northflank for deployments and hosting.\n\nGitHub-hosted runners are managed VMs that GitHub provisions and maintains. Self-hosted runners are machines you provision and maintain yourself. Self-hosted gives you more control over specs, software, and network access, but requires operational overhead and (starting March 2026) a platform fee.\n\nOptions include optimizing workflow efficiency, using caching, reducing build minutes, or switching to a platform with different pricing. Northflank charges for compute resources with no per-minute platform fee. Third-party runner providers like Depot and WarpBuild offer faster builds that reduce total minutes.",

    "description": "Tesla engaged in false advertising for its Full Self-Driving system. Unless it fixes the issues, its license to sell in CA will be suspended.",
    "fullText": "A California judge ruled late Tuesday afternoon that Tesla engaged in “deceptive marketing” in reference to its Full Self-Driving system, and that Tesla’s license to sell and produce cars in the state should be revoked for 30 days.\n\nHowever, the California DMV has said it will give Tesla 60 days to comply and fix its marketing before going through with the suspension.\n\nThe ruling is big news in a case that has been ongoing for years now.\n\nTesla has been selling level 2 driver assist software since 2016 which it calls “Full Self-Driving” (FSD), despite that this software did not (and still does not) make its cars capable of driving themselves.\n\nThis name has attracted much consternation over the years, becoming more absurd as each of Tesla’s predicted deadlines for the advent of full autonomy blow by.\n\nTesla also provides software under the name “Autopilot,” another term that evokes some level of autonomy, though perhaps not as explicitly as the aforementioned FSD. Tesla long held the position that this word is meant to evoke airplane-like systems that still require a pilot, but can just do most of the work for them.\n\nSo eventually, in 2021, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) officially started an investigation into Tesla’s marketing claims, to determine whether the company had lied to consumers.\n\nCalifornia found that the company was saying different things to the public than it was saying to the DMV.\n\nThe DMV then sent an official inquiry to Tesla in 2022, asking for it to respond to the claim that it was creating incorrect perceptions about the capabilities of its system. Tesla’s response stated that it had been allowed to lie about FSD for so long that it should get to keep going, which was apparently not persuasive enough to the courts, and the case was then slated for trial.\n\nDuring this time, the California legislature got involved as well, passing a law that specifically banned automakers from deceiving consumers into thinking vehicles have more autonomous capabilities than they do.\n\nWell, after all these investigations and waiting, we finally have an an answer, and the judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: Tesla lied to consumers about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nThe court looked at Tesla’s marketing claims and also at surveys of people exposed to those claims and their opinion of whether a Tesla would be able to drive itself, given the marketing messages put out by the company.\n\nIt found problems both with the word Autopilot and the phrase Full Self-Driving.\n\nThe word “Autopilot” was not found to be “unambiguously false,” but the court said that its use “follows a long but unlawful tradition of ‘intentionally (using) ambiguity to mislead consumers while maintaining some level of deniability about the intended meaning.'” The court found that a reasonable person could believe that a car on Autopilot doesn’t require their constant undivided attention, which is incorrect as the driver is still fully responsible for the vehicle.\n\nOn “Full Self-Driving,” the court was even more harsh. It found that this feature name is “actually, unambiguously false and counterfactual” (comically, Tesla tried to argue here that “no reasonable person” could believe that Full Self-Driving actually means Full Self-Driving).\n\nThe court noted other language used by Tesla, including marketing copy that said “the system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat,” and suggested that “legal reasons” are the only things holding Tesla back from full autonomy. Tesla tried to say that this was a statement of future intent, but the court found that its use of the present tense shows otherwise.\n\nTesla has repeatedly changed its wording around FSD, first calling it Full Self-Driving Capability, then changing that to Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to emphasize the need for a driver to supervise the vehicle. The court noted these changes, and then said it would not be a burden to force Tesla to change its marketing further to clarify that its cars do not drive themselves.\n\nWhich leads us to the proposed legal remedy: the court said that the DMV could suspend or revoke Tesla’s licenses for 30 days, stopping its ability to sell or build cars in the state.\n\nTesla’s first factory is in Fremont, California, where it still builds around half a million vehicles a year and employs some ~20,000 employees. Tesla says this remedy would be “draconian,” but the court said that without this option, there’s no reason to believe Tesla would stop its misrepresentations to the public.\n\nThe court also examined the possibility of financial restitution, but deemed that inappropriate. Since the case did not establish any quantifiable financial harm done by Tesla’s misrepresentation and noted the impracticality of accounting for that harm.\n\nThis ruling does not yet mean that Tesla can’t sell cars in California, which is its largest market in the US by far. The court noted that the DMV has the option of suspension or revocation, which the DMV can do at its discretion. And the DMV has said that it will allow Tesla 60 days to comply with the order before it takes action, and that it would focus on Tesla’s dealer license rather than its manufacturing license.\n\nThis would mean, specifically, that Tesla not refer to a level 2 driving system as “Autopilot” or using language that suggests these vehicles are autonomous. It will have to change its marketing materials and stop making public statements misleading the public about its autonomous capabilities.\n\nTesla said after the ruling that “sales in California will continue uninterrupted.” But we’ll see what happens in 60 days, and what sort of changes Tesla does or does not make to its deceptive marketing.\n\nTuesday’s ruling is just one of many legal cases against Tesla right now, specifically having to do with FSD. One relevant case is a class action lawsuit in California claiming Tesla misled customers about its cars self-driving capabilities. This ruling could provide fuel for that lawsuit, given a California judge has already gone on the record with an official determination that Tesla misled the public about FSD.\n\nThe 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year.

    "description": "DAAAM is a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding, building hierarchical 4D scene graphs with detailed natural language descriptions.",
    "fullText": "Computer vision and robotics applications ranging from augmented reality to robot autonomy in large-scale environments require spatio-temporal memory frameworks that capture both geometric structure for accurate language-grounding as well as semantic detail. Existing methods face a tradeoff, where producing rich open-vocabulary descriptions comes at the expense of real-time performance when these descriptions have to be grounded in 3D.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose Describe Anything, Anywhere, at Any Moment (DAAAM), a novel spatio-temporal memory framework for large-scale and real-time 4D scene understanding. DAAAM introduces a novel optimization-based frontend to infer detailed semantic descriptions from localized captioning models, such as the Describe Anything Model (DAM), leveraging batch processing to speed up inference by an order of magnitude for online processing. It leverages such semantic understanding to build a hierarchical 4D scene graph (SG), which acts as an effective globally spatially and temporally consistent memory representation. DAAAM constructs 4D SGs with detailed, geometrically grounded descriptions while maintaining real-time performance. We show that DAAAM's 4D SG interfaces well with a tool-calling agent for inference and reasoning.\n\nWe thoroughly evaluate DAAAM in the complex task of spatio-temporal question answering on the NaVQA benchmark and show its generalization capabilities for sequential task grounding on the SG3D benchmark. We further curate an extended OC-NaVQA benchmark for large-scale and long-time evaluations. DAAAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both tasks, improving OC-NaVQA question accuracy by 53.6%, position errors by 21.9%, temporal errors by 21.6%, and SG3D task grounding accuracy by 27.8% over the most competitive baselines, respectively. We release our data and code open-source.",

    "description": "Gen Z is starting to drink more alcohol, but data shows they feel the need to prepare an excuse if they're not indulging. It's forcing bars to change.",
    "fullText": "Gen Z drinks less than the generations before them, but the awkwardness they feel talking about alcohol is starting to transform where they go out, what they order, and how bars are built for them.\n\nYounger consumers say they feel more awkward than older consumers when explaining why they aren't drinking, new research from Heineken shows. While an increasing percentage of Americans feel comfortable declining an alcoholic drink with a simple \"no thanks\" (72%) or opting for a non-alcoholic alternative at parties (86%), only about half of Americans under 35 are comfortable drinking low or no-alcohol drinks in public.\n\nThey're also more likely to expect someone will question them, and more likely to feel they need an excuse for not drinking — a paradox, given that Gen Z drinks less overall.\n\nAs younger adults pull back from drinking while still worrying about how to justify it, nightlife operators are rebuilding their menus, spaces, and social experiences around a generation that wants to go out without having to explain what's in their glass.\n\nLaura Fenton, a research associate at the University of Sheffield's School of Medicine and Population Health who studies youth drinking behavior, said the tension around talking about drinking likely stems from social expectations. Even for Gen Z consumers, she said, \"drinking together can be really important to friendship and to negotiating kind of a sense of belonging.\"\n\nA Danish study she cited found that young people feel like they have to give a good reason when they don't drink or when they turn down alcohol with their friends, because \"drinking is kind of a demonstration of reciprocity.\"\n\n\"So if you're going to not be on the same level, you have to have a good reason,\" Fenton said.\n\nGen Z's approach to alcohol is also shaped by a notable anxiety about health concerns and other risks associated with drinking, as well as an aversion to the high costs. With cocktails priced at $15 or \n\n\"They're just a much more conscious consumer,\" Marten Lodewijks, president of the beverage market data firm, IWSR, told Business Insider. \"It's not that they just don't want to drink. They enjoy it, and they enjoy it as much as other generations. It's just that they're conscious that it's not good for them, and so they don't do it as frequently.\"\n\nOperators say the shift isn't theoretical; they're seeing it in real time.\n\nMichelin-starred chef David Chang said in a November interview with TBPN talk-show hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays that the decline in Gen Z's drinking is a \"real existential threat\" to restaurants if they don't pivot, given the industry's already thin margins.\n\nSober bars are cropping up across major metropolitan areas — and one operator told Business Insider in January that every bar will have to expand its non-alcoholic offerings to stay competitive.\n\nThat change is already taking place: mocktails now appear on menus not as afterthoughts but as full-fledged offerings that look, feel, and cost like traditional cocktails, Stacy Molnar, a designer who has worked on restaurant and bar concepts for more than 30 years, told Business Insider.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's about revenue per seat,\" said Molnar. \"If someone wants to order a $15 mocktail instead of a $15 cocktail, great — it makes them feel included, and the operator still hits their numbers.\"\n\nHeineken USA's Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Anne de Graaf, told Business Insider that \"Zebra Striping,\" which is when people choose to alternate between alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks, is also on the rise.\n\nBut it's not just the drink list that's changing; it's the overall bar experience.\n\nYounger consumers want something to gather around when they go out, such as board games, trivia nights, themed environments, Instagrammable bathrooms, striking focal points, and distinctive décor.\n\nIn other words, Molnar said, they want atmosphere.\n\n\"They're not going to a bar just to sit,\" Molnar, who has two Gen Z kids of his own, said. \"They want an activity. They want a vibe.\"\n\nFrom all-pink cafés trending on TikTok to bars built around entertainment, the industry is shifting away from alcohol as the main draw. Instead, it's centering aesthetic experiences that make socializing feel low-stakes — and alcohol optional.\n\n\"This isn't just about alcohol,\" Fenton, the youth-drinking researcher, said. \"It's about what young adults want from social life. If you think about it, for young adults, drinking is a social behavior, and it's largely geared toward forming and maintaining social bonds.\"\n\nBars that succeed with younger customers aren't just offering alcohol-free options; they're de-emphasizing alcohol altogether. They're transforming into multi-experience spaces where friends can hang out without feeling judged, pressured, or out of sync with the group, Molnar said.\n\nSo, what comes next? Expect to see more bars that are less about booze and more about belonging — and more spaces where saying \"I'm not drinking tonight\" doesn't require a speech.",

    "title": "The ugly truth at the heart of America's miserable job market",
    "description": "America's job market is paralyzed — and white-collar workers are struggling to land roles. The real culprit is high interest rates, not AI.",
    "fullText": "When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates.\n\n\"There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet,\" Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, \"The economy is paralyzed.\"\n\nThe labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the \"flattening\" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary.\n\nGiven the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're \"all in on AI,\" often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble.\n\nBut, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nIf you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell.\n\nThere is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called \"Scariest Chart in the World.\" The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street.\n\nAs chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI \"for every task possible,\" Microsoft is \"rethinking\" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots.\n\nBut is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not.\n\nAjilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is \"overblown.\" Many companies are \"using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient,\" he said, \"With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners.\" He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce.\n\nEven Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI \"is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet.\"\n\nThere's also an important piece of context missing from \"The Scariest Chart in the World\": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates.\n\nWhen interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees.\n\nIt's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end.\n\nThis sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. «tweaked the wording here since it was similar to a sentence in the graf above Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference \"modest to strong\" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that \"Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity,\" another said \"labor demand weakened overall,\" pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown.\n\nCorporate America began to lean into \"efficiency\" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue.\n\nThe trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors \"reduced hiring plans\" and were \"rightsizing\" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, \"uncertainty\" and \"tariffs\" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls.\n\nBut saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable.\n\n\"I think that what's happening is just simple economics,\" she said, adding, \"But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI.\"\n\nEach recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete.\n\n\"I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. \"There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable,\" he said. \"But it won't be cataclysmic.\"\n\nThe job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit.\n\nDespite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully.\n\nA pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, \"Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs.\"\n\nDeclining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's \"efficiency\" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers.\n\nEconomists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate.\n\nAllie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

    "fullText": "Moscow's wartime pivot to Beijing has helped keep Russia's economy afloat under the weight of sweeping Western sanctions — but at a cost.\n\nWhat looks like a lifeline today may lock Moscow into a long-term role as Beijing's junior economic partner. Russia is now heavily dependent on China for key manufactured goods and advanced inputs blocked by Western sanctions, according to a report from the Atlantic Council, a think tank, published on Friday.\n\n\"Economically and politically, Russia's relationship with China is simultaneously deeply asymmetrical and mutually beneficial,\" wrote Elina Ribakova, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Lucas Risinger, an economic analyst and nonresident research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics Institute.\n\nChina buys up Russian oil at volumes that offset lost European customers — at a discount — while Russia buys machinery, vehicles, and electronics from the East Asian giant amid Western boycotts and sanctions.\n\n\"This is a complete and embarrassing reversal in the relationship compared to the 2000s, when Russia exported higher value-added goods to China,\" wrote the analysts.\n\nSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country's economy into a wartime footing. Heavy defense and government spending help sustain topline resilience, despite sanctions and export restrictions.\n\nBut cracks are emerging as energy export revenues have fallen sharply in a low oil-price environment. Consumer demand has also weakened amid still high inflation.\n\nChina now accounts for a large share of Russia's imports, and the vast majority of its trade with China is settled in the Chinese yuan.\n\nRussia became China's top crude oil supplier in 2023, but the country accounts for just one-fifth of China's imports of the commodity. Meanwhile, oil and gas revenues account for a substantial one-third of Russia's budget inflows.\n\nTo be sure, China needs global buyers for its massive manufacturing sector, and Russia has become one of them. Still, the gains are \"far more important to Russia than to China,\" since Beijing doesn't rely on Moscow the way Europe relied on Russian energy, wrote the analysts.\n\nFurthermore, \"from an economic point of view, China is not a better trading partner for Russia than the European Union was. It buys oil and gas at lower prices, it invests far less in Russia, and its products are often technologically inferior,\" they added.\n\nThis skewed relationship gives Beijing substantial leverage in negotiations and transactions. China purchases Russian oil at steep discounts, knowing Moscow's alternatives are limited.\n\n\"While Moscow has not become Beijing's vassal — at least not to the extent that it would attack NATO purely to distract the Alliance from a war for Taiwan — Russia is certainly the junior partner in the 'no limits' partnership,\" the analysts wrote.",

    "description": "Health insurance costs are expected to rise in 2026 as ACA subsidies expire and new rules take effect. Here's what enrollees need to know.",
    "fullText": "As 2025 comes to a close, Americans are decorating for the holidays and agonizing over which health insurance plan to choose.\n\nThe decisions are complex and personal, as enrollees think about which plans best fit their income and medical needs. And, regardless of whether they have private or public coverage, most households are budgeting for higher costs.\n\nHere's what to know about insurance plans, enrollment deadlines, and policy changes in the new year.\n\nMost Americans have private, employer-sponsored health insurance or a government-based plan. Nearly all of these programs have active enrollment, meaning that people need to \n\nFor Affordable Care Act plans, the enrollment deadline was December 15, with some options to make changes until January 15 for a later coverage start date. The Medicare enrollment deadline for older Americans was December 7. Most coverage begins January 1.\n\nDeadlines for employer-based plans vary, but open enrollment tends to start November 1 and close in late November or early December, with coverage beginning on January 1.\n\nOnce Americans select their 2026 healthcare plan, they generally aren't able to change their coverage until the next open enrollment cycle. Missing open enrollment means you will need to wait until next year to \n\nPeople with qualifying life events, however, can adjust their plan if they file necessary paperwork with the government or their employer at any time throughout the year. Qualifying life events include a marriage, divorce, new baby, move, job loss, or major change of income.\n\nMedicaid rules are different from other insurance plans because it is income based. Americans can enroll in the program on a rolling basis throughout the year if they meet the qualifying criteria.\n\nBoth Medicare and Medicaid are government-based health insurance plans, though they serve different demographics.\n\nMedicare is typically for Americans age 65 and older, many of whom also receive Social Security — though some people with disabilities are also eligible. The program has four main plan types: Parts A and Part B are standalone insurance that cover inpatient and outpatient care; Medicare Advantage allows older Americans to join private plans governed by Medicare rules and out-of-pocket caps; and Part D is supplemental insurance that covers prescription drugs and basic provider visits.\n\nMedicaid is federally-funded health insurance for low-income households. The qualification threshold varies slightly by state, but tends to be based on the poverty line — which is $32,150 for a family of four. Most states have cutoffs between 138% and 260% of that level. These plans typically cover preventative visits, inpatient and outpatient care, and prescription drugs.\n\nIt's possible for low-income older adults to enroll in Medicare and Medicaid at the same time.\n\nSome families and pregnant women who earn above the Medicaid threshold but not enough for private insurance can also enroll in The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The requirements are different in every state, but are usually between 170% and 400% of the federal poverty line.\n\nThere are no income limits to enroll in marketplace insurance.\n\nIncome does come into play when deciding whether or not enrollees will receive tax credits that make their marketplace coverage more affordable. Between 2021 and 2025, Americans had access to enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. These credits lowered care and premium costs for low- and middle-income households based on their proximity to the federal poverty line.\n\nMarketplace insurance will still be available to Americans regardless of income in 2026, though it's likely that Congress will not extend the subsidies beyond their December 31 expiration date. Republican and Democratic senators are meeting this week to discuss the issue and plan to make a final announcement before they leave office on December 18. If the subsidies aren't renewed, it could make the cost of marketplace insurance skyrocket for many low- and middle-income enrollees and some may be priced out of coverage.\n\nEPO plans are often the cheapest option for private coverage, with low or nonexistent premiums. Americans may choose this coverage because it's more affordable to maintain, though the plans tend to be restrictive about care. Enrollees are required to see only in-network providers and may also need to seek in-network emergency care. If someone on an EPO plan sees an out-of-network provider or pharmacist, they're likely to be fully responsible for cost out of pocket.\n\nPPO plans have more flexibility but a higher price tag. The in-network coverage available to enrollees offers more doctor, clinic, and pharmacy options, and allows people to go out of network when needed. Though premiums are more expensive, these plans tend to be a better fit for Americans with chronic health conditions or ongoing prescription needs.\n\nHMO plans usually have a low monthly premium, but enrollees are limited to in-network providers except in emergency situations. These plans are best for older Americans who need preventative care, but don't have chronic conditions and rarely need to see a specialist. These plans are also common among older Americans with Medicare Advantage.\n\nAmericans aren't able to change their health coverage between EPO, PPO, or HMO plans once open enrollment ends, except if they have a qualifying life event.\n\nCosts for both private and public health insurance are expected to rise in the new year. This is due to a combination of factors: ACA subsidies are set to expire for marketplace plans, President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act is set to limit Medicaid funding, and the price of private health insurance is rising for companies — a burden that many are partially passing to employees.\n\nThough actual cost changes will vary widely, it's likely that Americans will experience higher premiums and deductibles for care going forward.",

    "description": "Mykhailo Fedorov said the drone was powered by a motor built in Ukraine. Its reported speed nearly rivals the fastest high-speed trains in the world.",
    "fullText": "A small Ukrainian drone built to chase down and intercept other aerial systems has recently achieved a speed of 400 kmph, or 248.5 mph, Kyiv's digital transformation minister said on Tuesday.\n\n\"400 km/h — that's the speed reached by an interceptor drone powered by a motor from Motor-G, a member of Brave1UA,\" Mykhailo Fedorov wrote in a social media post. Brave1 is Ukraine's defense innovation platform.\n\nSuch a velocity means that the interceptor can beat the official speed record for Formula 1 racing, achieved by Valtteri Bottas in 2016 at 231.46 mph.\n\nA speed of 248.5 mph also allows the drone to nearly match the fastest high-speed trains in the world. The Shanghai Maglev, for example, reached speeds of 280 mph during tests in October, but is commercially operated at 186 mph.\n\nAnd a motor-powered interceptor would be doing so with propellers, rather than the jet engines or high-thrust combustion systems that propel other vehicles to extreme speeds. Because interceptor drones are designed to destroy other drones at a low cost, Ukraine's manufacturers typically price them below $6,000 each.\n\nIt's another sign of how quickly the war is transforming the local weapons industry, which has turned hobbyist drones into some of the fastest yet cheapest aircraft on the battlefield. Four months ago, another Ukrainian interceptor drew widespread attention for reaching 195 mph in flight.\n\nUkraine is now ramping up ambitions to export such war technology, saying that its locally built missiles, drones, and anti-air systems have been tried and tested against Russia.\n\nA video posted by Fedorov on Tuesday said that producing drone motors in Ukraine \"seemed impossible\" just two years ago, but that Motor-G is now making 100,000 motors a month.\n\n\"Today, more and more drones are flying on motors made in Ukraine,\" the minister wrote.\n\nKyiv has been particularly focused on increasing the speed of its interceptors because Russia has been developing its own versions of the Iranian Shahed, which are long-range attack drones.\n\nThe most commonly used models of these loitering munitions fly at roughly 115 to 180 mph, and are often released in large numbers to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian tactic created the urgent need for Ukraine to develop cheap ways to destroy the Shaheds, which led to the rise of interceptor drones.\n\nHowever, Moscow has been repeatedly reported to be experimenting with smaller waves of new jet-powered Shaheds, which are believed to reach speeds of 230 mph.\n\nTheir emergence at the start of the year initially sparked fears in Ukraine that they would be too fast for interceptors to catch, though recent reports and war footage indicate that Ukrainian manufacturers have managed to close the gap.\n\nOne jet-powered Shahed, for example, was filmed being approached by a Ukrainian interceptor from behind in late November.",

    "description": "Amy Smith experienced unemployment and depression after a layoff at 57. She shares how persistence let her to a new job and hope.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Smith, a 59-year-old HR professional based in the Kansas City metro area. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI had spent the majority of my career in HR when I got laid off from my six-figure management job.\n\nOver the next year and a half, I went from living in an apartment with all the bells and whistles, not even thinking about money, to going on food stamps, selling my belongings, and moving into a friend's basement — all because I couldn't find a job. At 57, I couldn't help but feel like my age was working against me in the market.\n\nThe rejections took a toll on me, and I fell into a depression. I just had this feeling that everything was closing in on top of me. Some days, it even felt hard to breathe.\n\nAfter 20 months of job searching, I landed a role as an HR generalist that I love. If I could go back, I'd tell myself one thing to make my unemployment experience easier: Just get up.\n\nIn September 2023, I received a call from my boss saying he bank where I worked was restructuring, and my role would be eliminated the following month. I felt extremely disappointed, but I had been restructured from a previous role at the start of the pandemic, and it took me a few months to find a new job. I figured this time around it would take me at most 60 days.\n\nI applied to any HR position I could find, even entry-level coordinator roles on job boards like LinkedIn and Indeed. The response was rejection after rejection. I even hired a professional résumé writer for help. It was $450 that I didn't have, but I was striking out so much on my own that I thought I'd give it a try.\n\nIt was another kick in the gut when I sent the new résumé to my recruiter friend, and she took one look at it and said, \"You got taken, honey.\" She told me my original résumé was better.\n\nWhen I would get interviews, I often made it through the initial screening and the phone interview, but it seemed like once I got to the in-person phase, I would get a call saying they went with another candidate. I'm not a spring chicken, so that's where I believe ageism came in.\n\nThe rejections were taking me lower and lower. I deleted the spreadsheet where I tracked my applications because I couldn't take looking at it anymore.\n\nI stopped changing my clothes. I'd stay in my pajamas all day and maybe run a brush through my hair. Most nights, I would sit in the dark and just stare — no TV, no lights, nothing. I didn't want to look at my computer, answer my phone, or even climb out of bed.\n\nOnce February 2024 came around, my unemployment ran out, and I had to apply for food stamps. I remember bawling to myself. I just had this overwhelming feeling that I didn't know what to do.\n\nThen a point came when I thought to myself, \"This isn't you.\" I told myself, \"Get up, brush your teeth, brush your hair, and walk outside.\" I started forcing myself to leave the apartment every day. At first, it was just to grab the mail, then I started walking around outside my apartment complex to get some fresh air. It was about finding the determination to crawl out of that hole of depression, even just for five seconds at a time.\n\nThe next month, I started looking for work in my area and got hired to sell used cars. I had to sell cars that I knew weren't good quality, so on top of battling depression, I felt like I was taking advantage of customers. After a few months, I couldn't emotionally take it anymore, so I quit. I worked a few other odd jobs, including at a convenience store and another car dealership.\n\nIn August of 2024, I started selling any items I could on Facebook Marketplace, from furniture to my CPAP machine, to make rent. It wasn't enough, and I ended up getting turned over to collections for the rent a month before my lease ended.\n\nI packed up whatever I could fit in my SUV and moved to Florida to stay with family for a few months before coming back to Kansas City to live with some friends in the mother-in-law's quarters in the basement, which is where I am now. I'm forever grateful for them and their support, but I still battle with the fact that I'm now 59 and don't have my own home.\n\nA few months after moving back to Kansas City, I applied to an HR position at a health insurance company and went through a few rounds of interviews. I thought it went great, but I heard crickets.\n\nI followed up multiple times and was clear that I wanted the job. Eventually, I got hired. The CEO told me it was my persistence throughout the interview process that won him over. It's been fantastic since I walked in the door.\n\nI didn't feel it at the time, but the man upstairs has a plan for everything. This tough period of unemployment led me to where I am today, and I learned a valuable lesson in humility. I appreciate everything I have now, and I'm motivated to work even harder to get back the things that are important, such as my savings and retirement funds, my own place, and even my self-worth.\n\nIf I could talk to the version of me that was struggling most, I'd tell her to get out of bed, brush your teeth, and get out of your pajamas, even if it's just to put on a t-shirt and some jeans. Pushing myself to do something every day is what helped shake me out of my depression.\n\nTake a deep breath and know that at the end of the day, you've got it and you're strong enough to get through anything that's coming at you. Don't give up on yourself because you're worth it.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating long-term unemployment? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The Pentagon is policing troops' speech in ways experts call an \"abuse.\" Some service members are self-censoring and scrambling to scrub social media.",
    "fullText": "Pentagon leadership's intensifying scrutiny of speech that is critical of conservatives and the Trump administration is fueling anxiety in the ranks and has some service members scrambling to protect their careers.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, troops and legal advisors detailed how behavior has changed amid the recent crackdown, which has some facing administrative actions that can end a career without a court-martial.\n\n\"I had to take my pronouns off my LinkedIn. I've scrubbed everything that has ever mentioned or supported\" LGBTQ causes, the Marine sergeant told Business Insider. She said her mentor warned that Pentagon officials may be looking for \"anything that could be construed as contrary to the vision that the current administration has.\"\n\nThese individual acts of self-censorship mirror a broader chill sweeping the ranks, especially as the crackdown has burst into the open at the highest levels. Tensions flared again this week as the Defense Department said it was launching a command investigation of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly after a preliminary review of his video urging troops to defy unlawful orders.\n\nThe Trump administration says it has a prerogative to police speech it deems offensive or inappropriate, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said the administration's policies are intended \"to rip out the politics\" from the services. Some experts on military law say the scrutiny and its repercussions are an abuse of the military's authority.\n\nOne of the flashpoints has been the September murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Top Pentagon leaders have said it's \"unacceptable\" for troops \"to celebrate or mock\" the killing.\n\nAfter Kirk's killing, some service members said things online like \"glad he's dead.\" Others criticized his rhetoric or, more broadly, complained about Trump administration policies or conservatives. In one case, a colonel was suspended for lamenting to friends the angry arguments that followed Kirk's death.\n\nMore than 120 service members have been investigated for political comments since Kirk's death, according to a tally reported by The Washington Post.\n\nNearly a dozen military-law experts told Business Insider the punishments generally wouldn't hold up in a military courtroom because they lack the elements of speech crimes, such as \"contemptuous\" words against an elected leader, or because the comments were unrelated to the military and not said in uniform.\n\n\"What we're seeing now is abuse of speech restrictions,\" said Rachel VanLandingham, a Southwestern Law School professor and retired Air Force JAG who is an expert on military speech.\n\n\"Our service members understand that their rights are more restricted within the military. Now they're being chilled into giving up the rights they actually do have,\" she said. \"It's unprecedented.\"\n\nMilitary leaders have disclosed that they are tracking \"unprofessional\" social media use. An October message from the Navy secretary encouraged sailors and Marines to \"refrain from social media engagement\" about official government or military policies.\n\n\"This is more than just policing manners,\" said Frank Rosenblatt, a professor at the Mississippi College School of Law and a retired Army JAG. \"A wider muzzling of the military seems to really serve what they're trying to do — identify these deep state people who are not politically trustworthy.\"\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice imposes some restrictions on troops, criminalizing speech that disrespects officers and civilian leaders, or that undermines the obedience necessary to carry out orders. Troops retain many First Amendment protections; hate speech, for instance, is lawful unless it has a military connection, such as if it was uttered on a base or warship.\n\nThe hunt for speech crimes is fueling suspicion and distrust among some. The field-grade officer who shut down her Facebook said she now worries that a casual remark could brand her as liberal and thus politically suspect.\n\nShe has begun scrutinizing parts of her career she never imagined — where her office is located, who works nearby, whether to respond to articles shared in group chats, and even whether to travel with coworkers she doesn't know well.\n\n\"It just takes one person to flag you as disloyal to end your career — or worse,\" said the officer, who asked for anonymity to avoid official retaliation.\n\nDon C. King, a civilian defense attorney, said he got a call recently from a worried service member. They'd written a social media post critical of the Trump administration's lethal attacks on suspected drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela. Someone at their command saw it and told them, \"'Hey, you better be careful with your social media.'\"\n\n\"I've been in the military my entire adult life, over 30 years, and I've never seen any of the services or DoD scout social media for what it considers to be inappropriate speech,\" said King, who retired as a Navy JAG in 2022 and owns the King Military Law firm specializing in military clients.\n\nThe allegations against rank-and-file troops are unfolding in the military's administrative system, which can discipline troops and end careers outside of public court proceedings.\n\n\"These cases are early, and both the government and the affected individuals are figuring out how they want to fight,\" said Eugene R. Fidell, an influential military law expert and senior research scholar at Yale. \"The simple wear and tear of having to defend and try to overturn one of these administrative sanctions is itself a punishment.\"\n\nFirst Amendment restrictions on troops stem from the military's apolitical role and its reliance on obedience to orders. Officers can face criminal penalties for \"contemptuous\" words about the president, as can all personnel for disrespecting a senior officer. However, troops can comment politically, donate to a campaign, or display bumper stickers. Their protections are strongest when their comments are in a personal capacity, made out of uniform and without any hint of official endorsement.\n\nSocial media can amplify a service member's comments far beyond a bumper sticker, regardless of intention. That poses higher risks that the military as an institution could be seen as backing a political party or objective, said Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University who authored a 2023 book, \"Thanks For Your Service,\" about how high confidence in the military has depended on beliefs about its competence and its avoidance of partisan politics.\n\n\"The military is becoming combatants in the culture wars,\" he said. Part of the way to change that, he said, \"requires the military not to sound like they're culture warriors.\"\n\n\"So you may have a right to say it, but it wouldn't be right to say it,\" he added.\n\nMilitary law criminalizes conduct that disgraces an officer or damages good order and discipline; however, case law has set a high bar when the conduct at issue is purely private speech otherwise protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBrent Sadler, a defense expert at a leading conservative think tank, said speech monitoring is justified to enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n\"The issue is more about professionalism and protecting any appearance of the military interfering with political-civil control,\" said Sadler, a retired Navy captain and senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\"I do think numerous conservatives in the military have been persecuted legally and professionally,\" he said, pointing to the 8,000 troops kicked out for refusing the COVID vaccine mandate before the Pentagon rescinded it in 2023.\n\nMark Jensen, a former Army JAG who retired earlier this year, said the Pentagon's policing has expanded over the past few months from \"despicable\" speech about Kirk, to rebukes of his politics, to advocacy for transgender people, to criticism of the Trump administration.\n\nJensen represents four military clients and a civilian who face punishment for their speech. The fact that some of the allegations are public is the result of an anti-\"woke\" online army that publishes hearsay and leaked comments on sites like X.\n\nOn top of being \"smeared,\" Jensen said, these troops undergo the stress of an investigation, a relief if they're in leadership, a poor evaluation, a reprimand by a general, and face a review that can reduce their rank.\n\n\"It's like a 1-2-3-4-5 punch,\" Jensen said. \"All of it with minimal due process.\"\n\nKelly is not the only veteran to unexpectedly face punishment. In one recent case, an ex-soldier on the inactive reserve — a roster of those who can be reactivated in a national emergency — told a civilian attorney he was investigated by military officials for a private social media post, the attorney said.\n\n\"Even when people are in the normal reserves, the regulations are pretty clear that conduct in a civilian capacity shouldn't be punished in a military capacity,\" said Cody Harnish, a private defense attorney and former Army JAG who specializes in UCMJ cases.\n\n\"They're way out of their depth here.\"\n\nStaff writer Kelsey Baker contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Sometimes I use ChatGPT and it seems stunningly obvious that AI is going to have a transformative effect on my life. I use it more every day.\n\nAnd other times I find myself yelling at ChatGPT in ALL CAPS, because it can't do basic, simple tasks — ones I could reasonably farm out to a 5th grader. Or even worse: It can't do basic tasks but won't tell me it can't do them, and tries to fudge a result instead. And that makes me wary of using it again.\n\nIt turns out that the AI business has a great term for this dichotomy: \"The jagged frontier,\" coined in a 2023 research paper. Here's another way of putting it, via Reuters:\n\n\"It might be a Ferrari in math but a donkey at putting things in your calendar,\" said Anastasios Angelopoulos, the CEO and cofounder of LMArena, a popular benchmarking tool.\"\n\nThat quote comes from a report looking at the struggles various businesses have had implementing AI in their work. It's a theme we've been hearing a lot about over the last few months, like the MIT study that found that 95% of companies were getting \"zero return\" on their AI investment.\n\nThis issue is core to the \"Is AI a bubble and when will it pop?\" question, of course. Which is a very important question, with some $2 trillion in investment in play.\n\nBut I think it's not the only question: The tech isn't going away, so many of us are unquestionably going to be using AI in all kinds of ways, no matter what.\n\nSo a more practical question is: What kind of tasks can AI do reliably well today — reliably enough that businesses (and the rest of us) can use it day in and day out — and which ones are going to take a while to sort out? And which ones may never be something we can hand over to AI?\n\nThis is a pretty good summary of the ongoing experiments we're working out in real time, right now.",

    "title": "Inside Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's AI revolution",
    "description": "Internal documents and executive interviews reveal sweeping organizational shifts to radically reshape how the company builds and funds its products.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella views AI as an existential threat, a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and a chance to cement his legacy at the top of the tech industry.\n\nThe mission is both personal and professional for the Nadella, who is pushing the company to rethink how it operates at every level. That's according to internal Microsoft documents obtained by Business Insider, and interviews with leaders, managers, and other employees at the software giant.\n\nSweeping organizational shifts include high-profile executive changes and mandates for teams to work faster and leaner — all designed to consolidate power around AI leaders and radically reshape how the company builds and funds its products.\n\n\"Satya is pushing on intensity and urgency,\" one Microsoft executive told Business Insider. That's putting pressure on some Microsoft veterans to decide whether they want to stay and commit to the mountain of work it's going to take to complete Nadella's AI revolution.\n\n\"You've gotta be asking yourself how much longer you want to do this,\" this executive added.\n\nNadella is having conversations with executives to sign on for the transformation, or leave, people familiar with the matter said. Many of these people asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters, although one top executive spoke openly with Business Insider about the CEO's overhaul and Microsoft's AI future.\n\nNadella this year appointed a new CEO of Microsoft's commercial business to free up time to focus on the technical work necessary for his AI ambitions.\n\nAccording to an internal memo, Nadella also started a weekly AI accelerator meeting and corresponding Teams channel to speed the pace of AI work and get more ideas from across the company.\n\nExecutives do not present in these new meetings. Instead, lower-level technical employees are encouraged to speak and share what they're seeing from the AI trenches. This is designed to avoid top-down AI leadership, and is intentionally a bit messy and chaotic, according to people familiar with the new approach.\n\nOther major executive changes are looming. Three Microsoft executives told Business Insider that longtime Office and Windows boss Rajesh Jha has been mulling retirement. Insiders are also chattering about the possibility that Charlie Bell, who runs Microsoft cybersecurity, could retire.\n\nMicrosoft's spokesman Frank Shaw said the company does not expect any changes in the short term to its senior leadership team, of which Bell and Jha are both members.\n\nMicrosoft recently promoted Judson Althoff, its longtime sales chief, to an expanded role as CEO of the company's commercial business.\n\nAlthoff's promotion is intended to give Nadella and the company's engineering leaders more time to focus on AI, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider, which described this moment as \"a tectonic AI platform shift.\"\n\nNadella has shifted to saying the company is in the \"middle innings\" rather than the \"early innings\" of AI, a cricket term, and started saying he wants to see the game through, one of the people said.\n\n\"This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work — across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation — to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift,\" Nadella wrote.\n\nPractically, that's meant Althoff is spending more time as the face of Microsoft at events such as the recent Ignite conference, the first one in Nadella's tenure when the company CEO didn't deliver the keynote.\n\nOne executive told Business Insider the move seems to be paying off so far by giving Nadella \"extra bandwidth to really lead the company in learning, leveraging, and building AI.\"\n\n\"Satya is 100% engaged with leading the company to learn and embrace AI,\" this person said. \"The Judson move was brilliant. It actually allows Satya more time to advance the company in its AI journey. Satya spends a good amount of time in meetings you could characterize as AI learning, product, and engineering.\"\n\nNadella recently announced new marching orders for executives in another Teams channel, this one exclusively for Microsoft corporate vice presidents and above. The CEO said the company is at a turning point at least as significant as the shift to cloud computing and needs to completely rethink its business model.\n\n\"We all have to work and act like ICs in our own orgs, constantly learning and unlearning,\" Nadella wrote, referring to Individual Contributors, someone who is focused on technical work rather than managing people.\n\n\"I chuckle a bit each time someone sends me a note about talking to a friend at an AI start-up, about how differently they're working, how agile, focused, fast they are,\" the CEO added. \"The reality is that this work is also happening right here at Microsoft under our noses! It's our jobs as leaders to seek this out, empower it, cultivate it, and learn from our own early in career talent who are reinventing the new production function!!\"\n\nAsha Sharma, Microsoft CoreAI product president, who joined in 2024, said the company has shifted its operations dramatically in her short tenure. Nadella's new \"production function\" is about using AI to radically change how the company creates, builds, and delivers products and services.\n\nWhen she joined, the AI industry would crank out a big new foundation model roughly every six months. Then, releases happened every six weeks. Today, AI is changing so quickly that it's forcing Microsoft to rethink not just its products but the entire way software is made, Sharma said in an interview arranged by the company.\n\nFor decades, software development has worked like an assembly line. You take a set of inputs — people, time, resources — and transform them into output. Scaling production required scaling those inputs.\n\n\"AI breaks that relationship,\" she said.\n\nAI agents, data, and intelligence now act as a new type of scalable unit that can generate software, insights, and decisions without a corresponding increase in engineering hours or budget. That means the marginal cost of creating something new drops dramatically, Sharma explained, and teams can now spend more on \"judgment, taste, and problem-solving.\"\n\nWith so much changing, it's natural that leadership evolves — and Microsoft insiders expect more changes at the top.\n\nJha, a veteran executive who oversees famous Microsoft products such as Office and Windows, has been mulling retirement, according to three executives who spoke to Business Insider.\n\nStill, one of these executives noted that Jha has a newfound excitement about the company's AI potential, so he could stick around for Nadella's new intense era.\n\nIf Jha leaves, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky might succeed him, these executives said. Roslansky has been running LinkedIn since 2020 and Microsoft recently expanded Roslansky's role to include Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and the Microsoft 365 Copilot application, according to an internal announcement from Nadella in June.\n\nRoslansky started reporting to Jha for his new duties as executive vice president of Office, and to Nadella in his capacity as LinkedIn CEO, according to organizational charts viewed by Business Insider.\n\nCharles Lamanna, president of the business and industry Copilot group responsible for building AI tools like low-code applications, also moved to report to Jha at the time, and is taking on a bigger profile within the company, the people said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Harris Beber says that when he finds a role that aligns with these 3 things, he's able to find the most fulfillment in his career.",
    "fullText": "It's human nature to reach for the shiny object in front of you — but Monday.com's CMO says it's worth pausing before you accept the first job offer that comes along.\n\nHarris Beber has acted as the CMO of Vimeo, Global CMO of Google Workspace, and also held marketing executive positions at other companies including Amazon. He's no stranger to changing jobs — and he believes switching roles can be the right move when the work no longer feels fulfilling.\n\nIn the past, Beber told Business Insider that he's explored new roles in times when he was doing really well at work but feeling unfulfilled. That feeling can't last forever, he said.\n\n\"Eventually your work will suffer, your performance will suffer, and it doesn't end well for anyone,\" Beber said.\n\nTo avoid acting out of desperation or necessity, Beber said he tries to map out his next role before he gets to the point of needing a new job. The CMO said it's important to know your criteria for success when thinking about what's next.\n\n\"What is really important to you? What are your non-starters? And if you can look at those objectively, then when you have opportunities, you can measure it against something objective,\" Beber said.\n\nHe said he's used 3 P's to determine if his last few roles were the right fit: people, product, and position.\n\nIn regards to the first P, Beber said he tries to evaluate whether the people he's going to work with are right for him. He said it's \"not easy to get up every day\" and work with people you don't like or who don't treat others well.\n\nIn one job, Beber said he worked for a difficult leader who yelled, \"put intense pressure\" on the team, and treated him and others poorly. He said he would never work in that kind of environment again.\n\nBeyond working with respectful coworkers, Beber said it's also important to make sure that the people you work alongside have complementary skills that will help you work well together.\n\nIf you're a marketer, when it comes to evaluating the product you're selling, Beber said, it's important to understand the user base and product offerings.\n\n\"Do you care about it? Does it excite you? It's really hard to sell something to other people if you don't understand it or aren't excited by it,\" the CMO said.\n\nBeber said he made the mistake of once taking the wrong role at a sports tech startup. He said he really liked the people, but he's \"not a sports person,\" and didn't understand the product. Beber said he ultimately didn't find happiness in that job.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating the position, Beber said he wants to find a role where he feels aligned and can add value to the company.\n\n\"Is what I'm great at? What the company needs?\" Beber said.\n\nBeber said he's felt the most fulfilled in his career when those three criteria line up. People are \"really good at selling themselves\" on why an opportunity seems perfect in the moment, he said, which is why measuring the offer against something objective is critical.\n\nWhen someone makes you a job offer, \"they're going to tell you every reason why you're perfect for the role and why it's going to be great,\" Beber said. \"But as anyone goes into a new role, very rarely is it exactly what you thought it would be.\"",

    "title": "Meet one of BlackRock's top technologists who is supercharging its investment teams with AI",
    "description": "Kirsty Craig recently earned the distinction of tech fellow, partly because of her efforts to transform how BlackRock's investors work.",
    "fullText": "For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of \"translator\" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns.\n\nThis skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology.\n\nWhen it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The \"virtual investment analyst\" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June.\n\nIt leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes.\n\nNow, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess.\n\nAt first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists \"sits at the horizontal\" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research.\n\nShe found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar.\n\nWhen she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, \"but they've got no idea what it means,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nNish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an \"AI native,\" and added that her team is at the \"tip of the spear\" when it comes to applying AI to investment.\n\nCraig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams.\n\n\"I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research,\" she said of her work.\n\nCraig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success.\n\n\"If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle,\" she said.\n\nFor Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is \"a huge honor.\" Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site.\n\nCraig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics.\n\n\"If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact,\" Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists \"lean in.\"\n\nFor Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock.\n\nWhen it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing.\n\nAs she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far.\n\n\"We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles,\" she said. \"Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6.\"",

    "fullText": "Every year, my 15-year-old sister sends my family her Christmas list, and it gives me a snapshot into the hallways of high schools for Gen Alpha.\n\nAs the youngest of three sisters, she sends the list to our mom, our eldest sister, and me to divvy up how we see fit. I've come to expect it to be long and detailed down to the exact style and color she's looking for.\n\nHowever, this year I was caught off guard by the presence of some brands that my 30-year-old sister and I, a 26-year-old, were obsessed with at her age. Fashion is cyclical, but it's always interesting to see it unfold in real time, even if it makes me feel like I'm ancient.\n\nMy little sister is a dancer, so I wasn't shocked to see workout gear from popular athleisure brands, such as Lululemon, Alo, and Nike. The big surprises came from her requests for items I hadn't thought about since middle school. She asked for Victoria's Secret vanilla-scented body mist, flair leggings, and Ed Hardy sweatsuits, which were hot when I was growing up, for example.\n\nBrands like Hollister and UGG have each had a strong year in 2025, with double-digit year-over-year sales growth in their most recent quarters. They're making big comebacks with Gen Alpha teens, according to Piper Sandler's semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens survey, published in April.\n\nMy sister is no different, with multiple styles of UGG shoes and a specific Hollister item making the long list.\n\nAlthough a lot of the items sparked nostalgia for me — the Nike Elite backpack was a must-have when I was growing up — she also requested some brands that have popped off more recently. Fast-fashion brand PrettyLittleThing and Kim Kardashian's Skims are still establishing themselves as go-to options for young shoppers, such as my sister, for example.\n\nHere's the full list of what my sister wants to see under the tree this year.\n\nHer one caveat: We don't have to buy everything on the list. Thank goodness.",

    "description": "Affiliates of the world's largest HR trade group reaffirmed their independence in the wake of a discrimination judgment.",
    "fullText": "Some of the largest affiliates of the Society for Human Resource Management have publicly reaffirmed their operational independence from the trade group after it lost an employee-discrimination lawsuit in a $11.5 million verdict.\n\nBusiness Insider identified LinkedIn posts from 10 US affiliates that reference the case that led to the so-called \"nuclear\" verdict on Dec. 5. That includes SHRM's largest affiliate, in Southern California, which has roughly 3,500 members. All the posts stress how the groups operate independently from SHRM international, which is based in Virginia.\n\n\"While we are an affiliated chapter of SHRM, we are not governed by SHRM's management, and we were not involved in this case,\" said New York City SHRM.\n\n\"We have our own bylaws, board, finances, programming, and strategic priorities,\" wrote Chicago SHRM.\n\nNYC SHRM and Chicago SHRM say they have around 1,400 and 1,000 members, respectively.\n\nSimilar statements were posted on LinkedIn by SHRM affiliates in the northeastern US, Texas, Oregon, Illinois, and California. The vast majority of affiliates have not publicly commented on the legal situation.\n\nSHRM says it has 556 chapters worldwide. The organization sends some funds to its chapters, which may encourage local members to get certified and may also require members to pay dues to the international organization. Chapters are one kind of affiliate; state councils, of which there are 51, are another.\n\nThe organization said in response to Business Insider's questions that the independence of its affiliates \"has always been the case.\"\n\n\"We actually make a point of reminding our chapters and state councils that they are separate legal entities and make their own operational decisions,\" SHRM representative Eddie Burke said in an email. He didn't respond to questions about the substance of the posts.\n\nThe lawsuit that SHRM lost earlier this month was filed in 2022 by Rehab Mohamed, an Egyptian woman who worked at the association as an instructional designer from 2016 until 2020. She said in her complaint that she was racially discriminated against by a white supervisor and faced retaliation for complaining to management.\n\nA Colorado federal jury found SHRM liable on both fronts. The association was hit with $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million for punitive damages. SHRM has said it plans to file an appeal and that the jury's decision \"does not reflect the facts, the law, or the truth of how\" it operates.\n\nJane Billbe, president of Washington State SHRM, told Business Insider in an email that its post \"was intended to provide clarity for our members and stakeholders — not to distance ourselves from SHRM.\"\n\nThe California affiliate, the Professionals In Human Resources Association, wrote on LinkedIn that its code of ethics requires \"that everyone involved with PIHRA act with integrity, comply with applicable laws, and treat others with dignity and respect, free from discrimination, harassment, or retaliation.\"\n\nRafael Rivera, the affiliate's CEO since 2010, told Business Insider that he couldn't recall ever issuing a statement like it and believed some of his group's members were unaware of the distinction between the affiliate and main branch, or that SHRM had just lost an employee-discrimination case.\n\n\"The intent is to inform our audience that may not have the information,\" he said. \"They may assume that we're one and the same.\"\n\nIt's not the first time SHRM and its chapters haven't seen eye-to-eye. In 2016, SHRM sued a Northern California chapter for planning to hold its \"HR West\" event out of state without buy-in from SHRM chapters covering the cities where the event was to be held. The suit was dropped after the judge suggested that the agreement between the two parties wasn't as airtight as SHRM had asserted.\n\nBurke, the SHRM spokesperson, said that chapter \"is no longer part of our affiliated network.\"\n\nSome of the SHRM affiliates that posted on LinkedIn after the recent verdict wrote that they were speaking out because they'd been receiving inquiries from members concerned about the lawsuit and their affiliate's relationship to SHRM international. Some chapters require their members to also be members of SHRM, which increased its annual fee by 13% earlier this year, to $299. Burke said SHRM wouldn't be increasing dues this year.\n\nIn addition to membership, SHRM sells access to HR educational materials and credentialing programs, and bills itself as \"the foremost expert, researcher, advocate, and thought leader on issues and innovations impacting today's evolving workplaces.\"\n\nAhead of the trial, SHRM made an unsuccessful bid to have the plaintiff's lawyers barred from portraying it as a specialist in HR best practices. During the proceedings, the plaintiff argued that SHRM botched its own HR investigation into Mohamed's accusations of discrimination and retaliation.\n\nOne SHRM affiliate, DallasHR, said in its statement on LinkedIn that the verdict underscored the need for HR professionals to support and learn from one another.\n\n\"This is a validation of one of the core reasons DallasHR exists,\" the group said. \"Too often we assume in our organizations we are 'all trained up' and 'that would never happen here.' But none of us should rest on yesterday's knowledge.\"",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, dismissed bitcoin as \"worthless,\" and revisited his GameStop bet.",
    "fullText": "The mysterious Michael Burry has pulled back the curtain over the past six weeks, revealing his views on everything from bitcoin and meme stocks to the AI boom and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame was previously known for posting cryptic warnings on X, only to swiftly delete them and go silent for months or years at a time.\n\nHe has now closed his hedge fund to outside cash, and shifted his focus to writing about his personal investments and sharing his financial analyses on Substack.\n\nBusiness Insider trawled through Burry's Substack, X posts, and a recent podcast interview with author Michael Lewis to gather the key insights and details he has shared so far.\n\nBurry returned to X in late October after going quiet in April 2023. His commentary since then has centered on concerns of a historic bubble in AI.\n\nHe has warned that the tech companies leading the charge are seeing a slowdown in cloud-computing growth, overinvesting in equipment such as Nvidia chips and data centers, dragging out depreciation to inflate their short-term earnings, destroying shareholder value through excessive stock-based compensation, and signing \"give-and-take\" contracts with one another to keep the buzz going.\n\nBurry — who shot to fame after his lucrative bet against the mid-2000s housing boom was chronicled by Lewis in \"The Big Short\" — has also compared AI mania to the dot-com and housing bubbles, predicting it too will end in disaster.\n\nHe has labeled OpenAI the \"Netscape of our time,\" saying it's \"hemorrhaging cash.\" He has disclosed bets against market darlings Nvidia and Palantir, and predicted the AI bubble will burst within two years. He has also advised investors who've won big on high-flying assets to cash out their winnings.\n\n\"I think the stock market could be in for a number of bad years,\" he told Lewis during what might be his final interview, per his Substack.\n\nBurry also said that bitcoin trading at $100,000 was \"the most ridiculous thing\" as it's \"not worth anything,\" and called it \"worse than a tulip bulb\" because it has enabled so much crime. The most popular cryptocurrency now trades below $90,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Burry revealed that he has owned gold since 2005, and described Google-parent Alphabet as the \"value investor's favorite\" among mega-cap tech stocks.\n\nBurry told Lewis that the Fed has \"done a lot of damage\" since its founding more than a century ago.\n\nHe said the US central bank doesn't do \"anything very helpful,\" and the Treasury could just have a department to set interest rates and control the money supply instead.\n\nBurry has also warned that the US banking system is showing signs of \"fragility,\" and banks are \"getting weaker way too fast.\"\n\nMoreover, he has defended his past comments on the regional banking fiasco, pandemic-fueled inflation, and a potential meme-stock crash, saying his calls were largely on the money.\n\nHe has shared details of his personal portfolio, including that he has emulated most of his fund's positions and owns shares of Lululemon, Molina Healthcare, Shift4 Payments, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn a Monday post, he revisited his sale of GameStop shortly before the meme stock skyrocketed in January 2021, saying he had \"no idea what was coming.\" He also teased a future post that will be a \"breakdown of GameStop as an investment today.\"\n\nBurry's other revelations so far include the fact that he has known Nvidia's finance chief, Colette Kress, for years, and bought the chipmaker's stock in 2017 or 2018.\n\nAs promised in his Substack's name, \"Cassandra Unchained,\" Burry is speaking freely for the first time in many years — and may just be getting started.",

    "fullText": "It's December and there's something in the air.\n\nNo, it's not the sweet smell of Christmas cookies and hot cocoa (although that sounds great). It's a wave of unabashed bullishness that's taken over the collective mind of big investors.\n\nThe global investment strategy team at Bank of America, led by chief strategist Michael Hartnett, recently ran its monthly fund manager survey. In total, 203 participants with $569 billion of assets under management weighed in on markets and the economy.\n\nWhat resulted was BofA's most bullish survey in years. Here are the five main highlights:\n\nBofA's reading of sentiment combines growth expectations, cash levels, and allocation to stocks — and in December it rose to the highest level in four and a half years. The chart above highlights other past inflection points for investor sentiment.\n\nBofA attributes macro optimism to investors believing in a so-called \"run-it-hot\" trade, characterized by strong growth, fiscal stimulus, and a tolerance for potentially higher inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, forecasts for profit growth — which has historically been the biggest driver of stock gains — are at a multiyear high, a view that aligns with others on Wall Street.\n\nThis measure is calculated by combining the amounts allocated to stocks and commodities. BofA says that increase in exposure (shown by the dark blue line) indicates that manufacturing (light blue line) could accelerate.\n\nThe net percentage of respondents who expect a stronger global economy surged to 18% in December. \"Economic expectations are catching up with stock prices,\" BofA said.\n\nThis can be construed as a bullish signal, because investors putting money to work is a sign of conviction. It can also be viewed as a headwind, however, because less cash means less buying firepower.\n\nAre you feeling appropriately bulled up? Well, hold that thought.\n\nBofA's analysis comes with a twist: The more bullish fund managers get, the closer the firm's contrarian Bull & Bear index comes to flashing a sell signal. The strategists went even further and labeled overly bullish positioning as the \"biggest headwind for risk assets.\"\n\nThe firm's overall warning is that fund managers may be getting too bullish for their own good. While they're not quite there yet, it's a situation worth monitoring.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was expanding travel restrictions to an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, doubling the number of nations affected by sweeping limits announced earlier this year on who can travel and emigrate to the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the U.S. and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.\n\nThe move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from a broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nPeople who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the U.S. or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the U.S. interest, are all exempt from the restrictions. The proclamation said the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.\n\nIn June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.\n\nAt the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, the latest U.S. travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.\n\nAn additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the U.S. as visitors or to emigrate there.\n\nThe Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had “widespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records” that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.\n\nIt also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens whom the U.S. wished to deport or had a “general lack of stability and government control,” which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.\n\nThe Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the U.S.\n\nThe news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.\n\n“This expanded ban is not about national security but instead is another shameful attempt to demonize people simply for where they are from,\" said Laurie Ball Cooper, vice president of U.S. Legal Programs at the International Refugee Assistance Project.\n\nAdvocates for Afghans who supported the United States' two-decade long war in Afghanistan also raised alarms Tuesday, saying the updated travel ban no longer contains an exception for Afghans who qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa. That’s a visa category specifically for Afghans who closely assisted the U.S. war effort at great risk to themselves.\n\nNo One Left Behind, a longtime agency advocating for the Special Immigrant Visa program, said it was “deeply concerned” about the change. The organization said it appreciated the president's commitment to national security but allowing Afghans who'd served the U.S. to enter the U.S. — after extensive vetting — also contributes to the country's security.\n\n“Though intended to allow for review of inconsistent vetting processes, this policy change inadvertently restricts those who are among the most rigorously vetted in our history: the wartime allies targeted by the terrorists this proclamation seeks to address,” the organization said in a statement.\n\nCountries that were newly placed on the list of banned or restricted countries said late Tuesday that they were evaluating the news. The government of the island nation of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea said it was treating the issue with the “utmost seriousness and urgency” and was reaching out to U.S. officials to clarify what the restrictions mean and address any problems.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda’s ambassador to the United States, Ronald Saunders, said the “matter is quite serious\" and he'll be seeking more information from U.S. officials regarding the new restrictions.\n\nThe Trump administration also upgraded restrictions on some countries — Laos and Sierra Leone — that previously were on the partially restricted list and in one case — Turkmenistan — said the country had improved enough to warrant easing some restrictions on travelers from that country. Everything else from the previous travel restrictions announced in June remains in place, the administration said.\n\nThe new restrictions on Palestinians come months after the administration imposed limits that make it nearly impossible for anyone holding a Palestinian Authority passport from receiving travel documents to visit the U.S. for business, work, pleasure or educational purposes. The announcement Tuesday goes further, banning people with Palestinian Authority passports from emigrating to the U.S.\n\nIn justifying its decision Tuesday, the administration said several “U.S.-designated terrorist groups operate actively in the West Bank or Gaza Strip and have murdered American citizens.” The administration also said the recent war in those areas had “likely resulted in compromised vetting and screening abilities.\"\n\nAnika Kentish in Saint John’s, Antigua, contributed to this report.",

The answer I believe is OpenAI,\" wrote Osborne, who ran the UK Treasury from 2010 to 2016, in a Tuesday X post confirming the move.\n\nOsborne takes the role of managing director and head of OpenAI for Countries, an initiative launched by the AI startup in May that will see OpenAI partner with nations to build data centers and expand its $500 billion Stargate project beyond the US.\n\nThe former finance minister, who was a member of parliament in the right-leaning Conservative party until 2017, is the latest ex-British political heavyweight to join a US tech firm.\n\nRishi Sunak, the former UK prime minister, took on roles at OpenAI rival Anthropic and Microsoft as an advisor in October, while ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg worked as a senior executive on Meta's global affairs team from 2018 until stepping down at the start of 2025.\n\nBritish political salaries are dwarfed by the earnings of even midlevel employees at US tech companies. British prime ministers earn an annual salary of around £174,000 ($232,000), while salaries for research engineers at Meta can be as high as $400,000.\n\nOsborne's arrival comes as OpenAI continues to bulk up its executive ranks. The AI startup hired former Instacart and Meta exec Fidji Simo as its new CEO of applications in May, and this week hired veteran Google executive Albert Lee to lead its mergers and acquisitions team.",

    "title": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount's bid and says shareholders should go with Netflix",
    "description": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount Skydance and CEO David Ellison again. Read WBD's full letter to shareholders.",
    "fullText": "Warner Bros. Discovery still isn't interested in Paramount Skydance's offer.\n\nParamount's latest bid \"is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders\" compared to Netflix's bid, which \"represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders,\" said Samuel Di Piazza, the chair of WBD's board of directors, in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday morning.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, WBD's board recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's all-cash bid of $30 per share in favor of Netflix's cash-and-stock offer. Paramount wants to buy all of WBD, including its cable channels, while Netflix's bid of $27.75 per share is for WBD's studio, HBO, and HBO Max. A key difference between the two bids revolves around the value of WBD's TV networks, such as CNN and TNT, which Netflix isn't interested in buying.\n\nDi Piazza said that Paramount's seventh proposal \"once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated,\" including about Paramount's financing.\n\nParamount has said its bid is fully backstopped by Larry Ellison, one of the richest people in the world and father to Paramount CEO David Ellison. The WBD board said in the letter to shareholders that it relies \"on an unknown and opaque revocable trust\" whose assets or liabilities are subject to change.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix is paying with cash and stock. Its shares have fallen recently but surged more than 600% from mid-2022 to mid-2025. Netflix has a market cap of over $400 billion.\n\nWhile Paramount has said that it would have an easier time securing regulatory approval than Netflix, the WBD board says it \"does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk\" between the two proposals.\n\nThe Ellisons are close to President Donald Trump. However, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos has pitched the president on the deal and seems to have earned some respect. Trump has called Sarandos a \"great person,\" though he added that the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal \"could be a problem\" on the regulatory front. Still, the president hasn't come out publicly in favor of one side in the deal.\n\nWBD also said its board \"repeatedly engaged\" with interested parties, including the Ellisons. Paramount had previously said that WBD went quiet late in the bidding process.\n\nNot even Paramount can be surprised by WBD's decision to stick with its Netflix deal.\n\nDavid Ellison was overheard saying last week that if WBD's leadership were to \"accept the offer exactly as it is today, right, then they're admitting breach of fiduciary duty,\" Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat's because Paramount said its $30-per-share hostile bid was nearly identical to its previous offer to WBD. Public companies are obligated to act in the best interests of shareholders. So if WBD's board had changed its mind, it could have opened itself up to shareholder lawsuits.\n\nWBD had said in a statement after Paramount's hostile bid that it would \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer\" in a way that was \"consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors.\"\n\nNow that WBD's board has given Paramount the cold shoulder again, it's Ellison's move.\n\nThe aspiring media mogul told CEO David Zaslav that Paramount's latest offer wasn't its \"best and final,\" which suggests that a higher bid could be coming. Just how much appetite Paramount has to escalate the bidding war is the key question.\n\nIf no higher bid comes, WBD's investors have until January 8 to back Paramount, though it could extend that deadline. WBD would owe Netflix a $2.8 billion reverse breakup fee if its shareholders chose Paramount.\n\nRead the full letter to shareholders here:\n\nAs your Board of Directors, we are committed to acting in your best interest. In this spirit, in October, we launched a public review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value. This followed three separate proposals from Paramount Skydance (\"PSKY\"), as well as interest from multiple other parties.\n\nThat thorough process, overseen by the Board with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, as well as our management team, led to the company entering into a merger agreement with Netflix on December 4, with the substantial benefits to WBD shareholders described below. Having failed to submit the best proposal for you, our shareholders, PSKY launched an offer nearly identical to its most recently rejected proposal.\n\nAs a Board, we have now conducted another review and determined that PSKY's tender offer remains inferior to the Netflix merger. The Board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix merger, and that you reject the PSKY offer and not tender your shares.\n\nBelow, and in more detail in our 14D-9 filing, we highlight the many reasons for the Board's determination. None of these reasons will be a surprise to PSKY given our clear, and oft-repeated, feedback on their six prior proposals.\n\nThe terms of the Netflix merger are superior. The PSKY offer provides inadequate value and imposes numerous, significant risks and costs on WBD.\n\nThe value we have secured for shareholders through the Netflix merger is extraordinary by any measure.\n\nOur agreement with Netflix gives WBD shareholders $23.25 in cash, plus $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock (based on a collar range of $97.91 - $119.67 in the Netflix stock price at the time of closing), plus the additional value of the shares of Discovery Global and the opportunity to participate in future potential upside following Discovery Global's separation from WBD. The entire Board is confident in our recommendation that Netflix represents the best value-creating path for shareholders.\n\nPSKY has consistently misled WBD shareholders that its proposed transaction has a \"full backstop\" from the Ellison family. It does not, and never has.\n\nPSKY's most recent proposal includes a $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind. Instead, they propose that you rely on an unknown and opaque revocable trust for the certainty of this crucial deal funding. Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was — and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming — the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer.\n\nAnd a revocable trust is no replacement for a secured commitment by a controlling stockholder. The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change. As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time. And the documents provided by PSKY for this conditional commitment contain gaps, loopholes and limitations that put you, our shareholders, and our company at risk.\n\nAmplifying the concerns about the credibility of the equity commitment being offered by PSKY, the revocable trust and PSKY have agreed that the trust's liability for damages, even in the case of a willful breach, would be capped at 7% of its commitment ($2.8 billion on a $108.4 billion transaction). Of course, the damage to WBD and its stockholders were the trust or PSKY to breach their obligations to close a transaction would likely be many multiples of this amount.\n\nWBD's merger agreement with Netflix is a binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments. The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet. The debt financing for the PSKY bid relies on an unsecure revocable trust commitment as well as the credit worthiness of a $15 billion market cap company with a credit rating at or only a notch above \"junk\" status from the two leading rating agencies. The financial condition and creditworthiness of PSKY, which, if its proposed transaction were to close, would have a high gross leverage ratio of 6.8x 2026E debt to EBITDA with virtually no current free cash flow generation before synergies, raise substantial risks for its acquisition of WBD. Such debt levels reflect a risky capital structure that is vulnerable to even potentially small changes in the PSKY or WBD business between signing and closing.\n\nAdditionally, PSKY contemplates $9 billion in synergies from the mergers of Paramount/Skydance and their offer for WBD. These targets are both ambitious from an operational perspective and would make Hollywood weaker, not stronger.\n\nThe Board's review was full, transparent and comprehensive — establishing a level playing field that fostered a rigorous and fair process.\n\nThe Board repeatedly engaged with all parties, including extensive engagement with PSKY and its advisors over the course of nearly three months. We held dozens of calls and meetings with its principals and advisors including four in-person meetings and meals between David Zaslav and David and/or Larry Ellison and provided multiple opportunities for PSKY to offer a proposal that was superior to those of the other bidders, which PSKY never did.\n\nAfter each bid, we informed PSKY of the material deficiencies and offered potential solutions. Despite this feedback, PSKY has never submitted a proposal that is superior to the Netflix merger agreement.\n\nDespite PSKY's media statements to the contrary, the Board does not believe there is a material difference in regulatory risk between the PSKY offer and the Netflix merger.\n\nThe Board carefully considered the federal, state, and international regulatory risks for both the Netflix merger and the PSKY offer with its regulatory advisors. The Board believes that each transaction is capable of obtaining the necessary U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and that any difference between the respective regulatory risk levels is not material. The Board also notes that Netflix has agreed to a record-setting regulatory termination cash fee of $5.8 billion, significantly higher than PSKY's $5 billion break fee.\n\nThe offer can be terminated or amended by PSKY at any time prior to its completion; it is not the same thing as a binding merger agreement. The first paragraph of the offer states it is \"subject to the conditions set forth in this offer to purchase (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time)\" and continues on the next page, \"we reserve the right to amend the Offer in any respect (including amending the Offer Price)\". In addition, the offer is not capable of being completed by its current expiration date, due to the need for, among other things, global regulatory approvals, which PSKY indicates may take 12-18 months. Nothing in this structure offers WBD shareholders any deal certainty.\n\nThe PSKY offer provides an untenable degree of risk and potential downside for WBD shareholders.\n\nThere will be additional costs associated with PSKY's offer that could impact shareholders.\n\nWhen considering the PSKY offer at this juncture, it is important to note that its acceptance could incur significant additional costs to shareholders — all of which PSKY has ignored in their communications. WBD would have to pay Netflix a $2.8 billion termination fee, which PSKY has not offered to reimburse. In addition, WBD would incur approximately $1.5 billion in financing costs if we do not complete our planned debt exchange as agreed to with certain of our debtholders, which would not be permitted by the PSKY offer. This additional $4.3 billion in potential costs represents approximately $1.66 per share to be borne by WBD shareholders if the offer does not close.\n\nWe look forward to moving ahead with our combination with Netflix and delivering the compelling and certain value it will create for shareholders. We urge you to carefully read the 14D-9 filed with the SEC this morning and available on our website, which more fully details the strategic review process and the Board's reasons for its recommendation to you.\n\nThe Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors",

    "description": "My mom used to provide childcare for us, but after her cancer diagnosis, I'm her caregiver.  I became part of the sandwich generation overnight.",
    "fullText": "Just a few months ago, I wrote about how lucky I felt. My husband is a firefighter with long shifts (and overtime), and I'm a morning radio personality who wakes up hours before the sun rises. Though our work schedules can be difficult, we have a village that includes both my mother and my in-laws, and not only are they close by, but they're also dependable.\n\nThat is, until everything changed one night.\n\nAbout a month ago, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer during a visit to the emergency room. In one night, my whole world turned upside down. I went from being a thriving, working mother with a strong support system to becoming part of the sandwich generation, where I'm balancing my career, motherhood, and caregiving all at once.\n\nThere's a special kind of heartache that comes with this transition. I've gone from coordinating zoo outings and babysitting details to learning about chemo protocol and how to interpret lab results. The mental load didn't just double — it's rewired my brain.\n\nI still wake up early in the morning to do morning radio, and I'm growing a business that requires both consistency and visibility. Now, however, my days look a little different. Oncology appointments, extra chores, and pharmacy runs are all part of my day, too — all while trying not to show any more fear than I need to.\n\nAnd even through all of this, I still have a toddler to raise. When the sun starts to set, I'm reminded that I still have to handle bathtime and pretend I'm not exhausted, so my daughter doesn't even notice for a second that something is off.\n\nThis experience has taught me just how delicate our support systems really are, and how things can truly change in an instant. We talk about \"having help\" and \"having a village,\" and oftentimes, that system is built on the health and stamina of a few key players, who will assume will always be there. And when things get rough, and those you depend on now need help themselves, the entire structure has to be rebuilt.\n\nThere is a lot of guilt and grief in rebuilding. Guilt that I can't show up with the energy I once had, the same way I used to. For my daughter, my career, my family, and my business. Grieving a life and future I once envisioned for myself at this stage, where my present mother would be the most involved and loving grandmother there ever was.\n\nI also find myself feeling guilt that my daughter doesn't get as much time with her babcia, who once helped raise her. And there's guilt, too, for even admitting how much easier life was before, even though I know grief and gratitude can coexist.\n\nI was not prepared to watch the person who once raised me become the incredible grandparent she was meant to be, and then suddenly need extra support and help with all types of tasks. It's absolutely reshaped how I think of the phrase \"having it all,\" too. As someone who felt like I was thriving in motherhood, my career, my personal life, and my business, I quickly discovered this was all attainable because someone else made it possible.\n\nDespite the changes that have occurred in just one month, I will say that I still believe in villages. I still believe in asking for help and for support wherever you can. But now, I understand how quickly all that can change, or go away. I realize just how important it is to acknowledge both the privilege of having a support system, and what it's like when your village needs you just as much in return.\n\nI'm also choosing resilience on purpose — not by doing more, but by doing less. I'm proudly narrowing down my world to be a caregiver for my mom and my daughter and letting nearly everything else take a backseat right now. This is the sandwich generation: holding your parent in one hand, and your child in the other, and being resilient while loving in both directions at once.",

    "fullText": "Nike cofounder Phil Knight topped the list of the biggest charitable donors this year.\n\nThe billionaire and his wife, Penny, pledged $2 billion to Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) to support the Knight Cancer Institute — more than double the size of the second-largest donation.\n\nThat's according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, which released its annual list of the largest publicly announced gifts this week.\n\nKnight, whose net worth sits at $31.2 billion, per Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has a decadeslong philanthropic relationship with OHSU.\n\nThe Knight Cancer Institute was named in honor of Phil and Penny Knight after they donated $100 million to the institute in 2008. They have since donated millions more.\n\n\"Wealthy donors often give their largest donations to nonprofits with which they've built long-term relationships, and this gift is a good example of that,\" Maria Di Mento, a senior editor at the Chronicle of Philanthropy, told Business Insider.\n\nWarren Buffett dominated the list with four megagifts, donating more than $1.3 billion across the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, the Howard G. Buffett Foundation, the NoVo Foundation, and the Sherwood Foundation.\n\nAt 95, Buffett remains one of the world's leading philanthropists. Despite ranking among the wealthiest people on the planet with a net worth of about $150 billion, he is famous for his frugal lifestyle, from living in the same Omaha home he bought in the 1950s to eating McDonald's breakfasts and driving a modest car.\n\nJackie and Mike Bezos — Jeff Bezos's mother, who died in August, and stepfather — also ranked among the year's biggest donors with a $500 million gift to UNICEF USA for its Child Nutrition Fund.\n\nThey aren't new to large-scale philanthropy — in 2022, the couple committed $710.5 million to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle to boost cancer research and care.\n\nThe Chronicle of Philanthropy tracks only publicly announced gifts to nonprofit organizations, excluding anonymous or unconfirmed contributions.",

    "title": "Hunted by drones, Ukrainian forces hide behind darkness, bad weather, and smoke to rescue wounded troops, officer says",
    "description": "The surge of drones on the battlefield has made it almost impossible to pull off traditional casualty evacuations.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian soldiers can’t always rush out to rescue their wounded comrades. Instead, they often have to wait for inclement weather or for someone to stir up a bit of chaos to cloak their evacuations, a senior military officer told Business Insider.\n\nThe significant drone presence means that the \"battlefield is visible 100%,\" making it all but impossible for Kyiv's forces to pull off traditional casualty evacuations, Ukrainian Col. Valerii Vyshnivskyi said in an interview, reinforcing warnings about the effect that uncrewed systems have on front-line medical care.\n\nVyshnivskyi, Kyiv's senior representative to the NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis Training and Education Centre, an initiative which uses real-time lessons from the conflict to inform Western defense planning, said that soldiers sometimes have to wait for nighttime, fog, or rain — when visibility is difficult — to evacuate their wounded comrades.\n\nHe said that soldiers also manufacture poor visibility with smoke grenades, but this tactic risks drawing Russia's attention.\n\nDrones are surging on the battlefield, giving both Ukrainian and Russian forces persistent surveillance options and the ability to carry out precision strikes in a miles-wide kill zone that extends in either direction along the front line.\n\nMovement in the kill zone has become extremely dangerous and has effectively erased the long-held hope of getting wounded troops critical life-saving trauma care within the \"golden hour\" — the first 60 minutes after a severe injury when medical treatment determines whether a soldier lives or dies.\n\nVyshnivskyi said that the situation has \"changed dramatically\" since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion; golden hour has been replaced by a golden day, or some longer stretch of time.\n\nAlthough it can be difficult, there are ways to get wounded troops out of the kill zone. Ground robots, for instance, have become an increasingly popular choice for Ukraine because they lower the risk for medical crews. Vyshnivskyi said that Kyiv's forces plan out routes for the small vehicles, sometimes working at night under the cover of darkness.\n\nHowever, Russian drones will also track the robots. And Ukrainian troops have said that they experience technical issues at times, which could leave wounded soldiers exposed and vulnerable.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is that evacuation and logistics routes are increasingly under attack. Ukraine has tried to remedy the threat by covering key roadways with anti-drone netting, but soldiers have told Business Insider that Russia can still find small holes to stage attacks.\n\nEven farther back from the front lines, there is still a risk. Combat medics and soldiers have told Business Insider that Russia attacks medical vehicles, while international governing bodies have accused it of striking healthcare facilities. Moscow has denied these allegations.\n\n\"We know how to resist enemy artillery,\" Vyshnivskyi said. \"We have counter-battery measures — we implement them and are quite successful in that. But drones are still a big challenge.\"\n\nHis assessment reflects past warnings from combat medics and soldiers fighting in Ukraine, as well as Western officers training Kyiv's forces, that drones have made immediate casualty evacuations nearly impossible, forcing a change in the approach to medical treatment.\n\nAmerican generals predicted years ago that high-intensity future warfare could upend the type of combat medical care that US forces enjoyed when they could achieve air superiority and send in helicopters to whisk injured troops away for treatment.\n\nWith small drones now threatening just about anything that moves near the front line and advanced surface-to-air missiles positioned to shoot down aircraft, those grim predictions have become a deadly reality in Ukraine.\n\nBoth sides in this war have taken heavy losses since the full-scale Russian invasion began in 2022, though neither has publicly disclosed any official figures. Ukraine is believed to have suffered some 400,000 casualties, while Western officials think Russia has surpassed a staggering 1.1 million dead and wounded.\n\nVyshnivskyi said that, in a war against Russia, NATO would face the same casualty evacuation challenges and likely see more soldiers killed and wounded than in the war in Ukraine.\n\nNATO leaders, warning that the alliance could find itself at war with Russia, are taking into account the possibility of heavy losses and are pushing to find solutions to the problem of life-saving care in a battlespace infested with drones.\n\nEarlier this month, NATO hosted an event in London for companies to showcase medical technology that could solve some of the issues Ukraine is facing on the battlefield, including how to conduct casualty evacuations under constant surveillance.\n\nBritish Army Col. Niall Aye Maung, the medical branch head for NATO's ACT and the medical advisor to the alliance headquarters in Brussels, told Business Insider that some of the solutions featured at the event have a dual purpose — for use in Ukraine in the immediate term and in the West during a potential future high-intensity conflict.\n\n\"NATO is certainly posturing itself to be able to manage that scenario because of the lessons learned\" in Ukraine, he said.",

    "fullText": "Billions of dollars are about to be spent on upgrading the country's air traffic control system, according to the boss of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA is committing $6 billion on ATC telecom and radar infrastructure, Administrator Bryan Bedford told a House subcommittee on Tuesday.\n\nThe new infrastructure is set to be deployed by the end of 2028, down from a previously planned timescale of 15 years, Bedford said.\n\nIt comes after incidents this year have highlighted the fragility and age of the current system.\n\nHowever, while Congress has so far approved $12.5 billion to upgrade the air traffic control system, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said it will cost $31.5 billion overall.\n\nPassengers around the country have faced disruption this year due to the aging ATC system.\n\nIn April and May, several communications outages occurred at a control center that guides planes in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nRadar displays briefly went offline, so the FAA had to slow arrival and departure rates. The airport has also been dealing with runway construction.\n\nAt one point, Newark was limited to an hourly rate of 34 departures and arrivals, less than half the number it typically handled.\n\nThe government shutdown in the fall further exposed the fragility of the ATC system.\n\nControllers were among the federal workers who were told they had to keep working without a paycheck. As the shutdown dragged on, fewer and fewer controllers turned up for work.\n\nIn California, Hollywood Burbank Airport's control tower was left unstaffed for about six hours one day.\n\nEventually, the FAA had to mandate flight cuts at 40 of the country's busiest airports due to staffing shortages.",

    "description": "Brands like Ballerina Farm, Beam, and CocoaVia are selling \"healthier\" hot cocoa, optimizing with supplements for heart health, gut health, and sleep.",
    "fullText": "There's no shortage of ways to boost your longevity — even during peak holiday season.\n\nOver the past month, I've heard more and more whispers of optimized hot cocoa. Online, influencers swear by nighttime hot cocoa from MoonBrew and Beam, containing magnesium, l-theonine, and reishi to promote deeper sleep. Brands like CocoaVia and Black Forest sell cocoa flavanol powder, a cocoa compound said to boost heart health. Just Ingredients' hot chocolate, meanwhile, boasts being sugar-free and includes collagen, ashwaganda, and lion's mane for \"added benefits.\" Ballerina Farm recently launched a \"bone broth hot cocoa\" with protein, collagen, and amino acids — purportedly to help with everything from gut to joint health.\n\nPart of the appeal is the process of stirring a cozy drink instead of popping another multivitamin. \"You're creating an experience out of your supplement,\" Jordan Glenn, the head of science at SuppCo, a supplement tracking company, told Business Insider.\n\nWhile drinking a multi-supplement concoction can feel like a fun solution to capsule fatigue, he said it doesn't necessarily make the most sense, from a health standpoint. Supplement-infused hot cocoa can be pricey — some breaking down to about $2 a cup — with lower-than-recommended doses of the supplements in question.\n\nI'll go even further and say: let holiday treats be holiday treats.\n\nYes, it's always good to cut down on sugar, and yes, the average Swiss Miss hot chocolate contains a few emulsifiers I'd rather not think about. But in the grand scheme of your health, concrete research shows it's better to have the occasional sugar-bomb hot cocoa (mini marshmallows and all) than knock back a cup of the \"healthy\" stuff every night.\n\nBecause cacao beans have high levels of heart-healthy antioxidants and flavanols, dark chocolate (the kind with the least sugar) was promoted as a health food for years.\n\nMany headlines missed the nuances — primarily that relying on chocolate for nutrients isn't a good idea. \"I don't think anybody is going to eat enough chocolate to bring their cholesterol and blood pressure down without doing a lot of other damage to blood sugar, weight, and things like that,\" Lauren Gilstrap, MD, a cardiologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health Center, previously told Business Insider.\n\nFurthermore, she said that the healthiest dark chocolate contains an 80% or more concentration of cacao — more of a bitter brick than a Godiva truffle.\n\nIf one is determined to chug goblets of 90% pure cacao for the sake of lowering their biological age, they're free to try. But there are other downsides to painstakingly fixating on longevity.\n\nIt's a problem Dr. Steven Austad, the scientific director of a nonprofit researching healthy aging, has increasingly noticed in his field. \"If you spend all your time thinking about how long you're going to live, you kind of forget to live,\" he previously told Business Insider.\n\nOverall, Glenn said that most of the aforementioned hot chocolate powders are fine to take at the recommended doses because, again, they already contain low levels of each supplement.\n\nHe said that out of all the hot chocolates, Ballerina Farm's appeared to be the only one with added sugar — something to consider for those trying to cut back.\n\nThe only cocoa Glenn advised thinking about was the powder from Beam, which contains melatonin and is marketed as a nightly supplement.\n\n\"Psychologically, people can be like, 'well, if I don't have this, I can't sleep well,'\" he said. \"I don't recommend people take melatonin every day, I don't think that's a good idea.\" Beam did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nHe said the biggest question to ask yourself is what problem you're trying to fix, and how the supplement will help. Otherwise, you fall into the trap of over-optimizing — or just wasting money.\n\n\"There's this longevity boom right now,\" he said. \"'If you're not doing infrared and sauna and cold baths and have a 15-supplement stack, you're probably going to die tomorrow.' We kind of lose the plot.\"\n\nThe great news is you don't need to drink optimized hot cocoa for better health (unless you genuinely love the flavor).\n\nPlenty of centenarians drink alcohol and eat sweets, both in moderation. The more meaningful secrets to a long life are less about scrutinizing your hot chocolate ingredients and more about the basics: exercising regularly, eating as many whole foods as you can, getting enough sleep, and spending time with loved ones.\n\nGlenn echoed the same, noting that supplements can only provide \"micro benefits\" to an already healthy lifestyle.\n\n\"If you're trying to use this hot cocoa supplement because you're staying up till 3:00 AM streaming Netflix and you feel sleepy, that's not how it works,\" he said.\n\nSo have that powdered hot chocolate that brings you back to your childhood snow days, before you had an airtight morning routine. Better yet: clink that mug with a friend.",

    "title": "What job seekers and employers need to learn about AI and hiring, according to Indeed's top marketer",
    "description": "Indeed's CMO explains how AI hiring tools benefit employers and job seekers, urging both to optimize recruitment strategies for better results.",
    "fullText": "Job openings were down in 2025, yet employers still struggled to find the right skills match for their open positions, according to Indeed's 2026 US Jobs and Hiring Trends Report.\n\nThat paradox is a focus for James Whitemore, who joined Indeed as chief marketing officer in June 2025, the same month former CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba returned to lead the company once again. \n\nWhitemore told Business Insider that both companies and candidates have to reorient how they share information, add more details and nuance to postings and profiles, and move towards natural language to optimize for AI.\n\nThese shifts are central to two new AI tools the company rolled out for job seekers and employers in September, called Career Scout and Talent Scout, and an API integration for employers, called Indeed Connect, which is launching in January 2026.\n\nWhitemore also shared how Indeed's marketing team is using AI to maximize its first-party data, and uncanny experiences with synthetic audience testing.\n\nThe following interview is edited for length and clarity.\n\nBusiness Insider: What do employers need to know about hiring using AI tools?\n\nJames Whitemore: We're trying to shift the whole conversation from job search to one that is more proactive, where a potential employer is sourcing and screening for the right candidates, rather than the candidates having to go find the job.\n\nSo first, when you are looking for candidates, how do companies build their profiles? A lot of large-scale employers have really complex search strings that they use to source candidates.\n\nWith our new tools, you're not using search strings anymore. You are using real-language descriptions of skills, personality traits, and educational backgrounds. Teaching employers how to use the tools and how to form searches, describe candidates, and the type of people that they want, is key.\n\nThen to make the AI tools work effectively, there is much more ongoing communication about the candidate, so much more disposition sharing about who moved through the interview process and why some people were screened out versus other people who moved forward. That way you can constantly teach the platforms what worked for them.\n\nSo bringing all this together can be automated?\n\nYes, we call it Indeed Connect, which is basically an API-to-API integration between the Indeed platforms and the company's HR tech stack. The benefit that brings employers is that they can use those screening and sourcing tools across multiple sources of candidates.\n\nMost large-scale employers will have their own databases of candidates, and they're looking at other third parties, but you can use a consistent set of sourcing tools across all of those candidates, not just the ones that are coming in from Indeed.\n\nJob seekers are frustrated with the hiring process. What do they need to know in order to stand out in AI-assisted search?\n\nYou want yourself to be as searchable as possible when employers are using advanced sourcing and screening tools.\n\nThe key thing is to make sure that you have a full and complete profile, and that the profile goes beyond your resume. A resume is a historical look back at what you have done in the past. What most employers are really interested in is what you are capable of doing in the future.\n\nWhen I think about our own team, we're looking for somebody who understands marketing, but also general-purpose people who understand a business process, who can be used effectively across multiple tasks.\n\nResumes typically don't bring out soft skills. Completing your profiles and talking about what makes you tick and what excites you in \"about me\" sections is important, so that as those profiles get screened, you are much more likely to show up as somebody who is an adaptable, curious type of person.\n\nWhat are other best practices for job seekers today?\n\nTo be successful, you need to be very focused on the type of jobs you want. Mass-applying to jobs that aren't a good fit for you is not going to get you anywhere other than frustrated.\n\nAlso, it's OK to be constantly looking. The concept of \"come look for a job when you need a job\" is not the right way to be thinking about it. You should be passively open to understanding what jobs are open to you on an ongoing basis, rather than just coming to look for a job when you need a change for some reason.\n\nThat's the concept Indeed is moving to, from a place where you come to look for a job to a place where you expose your skills, your capabilities, your ambitions to potential employers, and those employers can find you when they need someone with your skills.\n\nHow is Indeed's marketing team using artificial intelligence?\n\nMarketing is one of the disciplines that has the opportunity to be most transformed by the use of AI tools. A big element is understanding and segmenting audiences in ways that we've never been able to do before.\n\nAt Indeed, we have rich first-party audience data. We know who people are, what their job histories are, education, salaries, and much more data than a lot of CMOs have to work with.\n\nBeing able to take that data and compare it to third-party databases — that technology is rapidly evolving. Then it's being able to take those audience segments and run them against mass-scale media databases, so that you understand exactly where those people are consuming content across digital, print, radio, and TV.\n\nThe ability to test messages against a synthetic audience is also fascinating. We're running synthetic marketing tests versus traditional tests, and the synthetic tests are just as accurate. Then you can take that data and feed it into the content engines, so that you are producing personalized content for audiences at scale.\n\nIt's amazing to see how it's constantly evolving, so quickly. Part of the message to the team is that marketing has got to be at the leading edge of AI. We do a lot of work with our vendors, bringing them to demo their platforms and talk about their roadmaps.\n\nHow do you manage the variety of marketing AI systems and vendors?\n\nI'm interviewing right now for a senior director of marketing transformation who will lead that group. It is so important to have somebody who is really on point to lead the discussions.\n\nWe purposely didn't call it \"head of AI\" because it's really looking at the processes, the workflows, the way that we work with others around the organization, as well as all the tools and technology, which is so important to get right.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is planning an executive order that would limit dividends, buybacks and executive pay for defense contractors whose projects are over-budget and delayed, according to three ​sources briefed on the order.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Pentagon have been complaining about the expensive, slow-moving and entrenched ‌nature of the defense industry, promising dramatic changes that would make the production of war equipment more nimble.\n\nIndustry groups have been on high alert about the ‌closely-held proposal, which is tied to a Treasury Department initiative, two of the sources said.\n\nA White House official said: \"Until officially announced by the White House, discussion about potential executive orders is purely speculation.\"\n\nShares ⁠of Lockheed fell 1.6% and Northrop Grumman sank ‌2% in after-hours trading after some aspects of the news were first reported by online political news service Punchbowl.\n\nDEFENSE FIRMS OFTEN BUY BACK SHARES\n\nShare buybacks are common among defense firms, and several pay a ‍dividend. Lockheed in October, for example, raised its dividend for the 23rd year in a row, to $3.45 per share. At the same time, it authorized the purchase of up to $2 billion of its shares, raising the total amount promised for repurchases to $9.1 billion.\n\nLockheed's F-35 fighter jet, one of ​the most expensive U.S. defense programs, has been plagued by rising costs and delays. Many big defense programs take much longer ‌to deliver a product than initially promised and at a far higher price.\n\nThe $140 billion Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program that will replace aging Minuteman III missiles, designed and managed by Northrop Grumman, will be years behind schedule and 81% over budget, the U.S. military said last year.\n\nThe biggest defense firms, including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the executive order.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth unveiled sweeping changes in November to how the Pentagon purchases weapons, ⁠allowing the military to more rapidly acquire technology amid growing global threats, ​in accordance with an executive order signed by Trump in April.\n\nThat restructuring will ​have direct authority over major weapons programs to eliminate bureaucracy.",

    "description": "Vessels brimming with coins suggest a convenient method of hiding savings underground.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAn excavation in Senon, France, unearthed three amphorae full of ancient Roman coins that had been buried under the floor of what was once a living room.\n\nThis region of France was once populated by a Celtic tribe known as the Mediomatrici, who were eventually conquered by the Romans.\n\nThe way that the amphorae were buried so close to ground level suggests that they were supposed to be accessible for deposits or withdrawals.\n\nThere was (obviously) no such thing as online banking 1,700 years ago. While the ancient Romans did adopt early banking systems from ancient Greece, the most convenient way to put aside cash that would have simply been transfered into a savings account over a thousand years later was remained stashing it in a vessel that was later buried.\n\nWherever the Roman Empire spread, its customs came with it. The empire and all its wealth extended through France, and archaeologists from the National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research (INRAP) have now unearthed three clay amphorae overflowing with coins. Found at a site in Senon, northeastern France, makeshift piggy banks were buried in a pit beneath the lime concrete floor of what was likely someone’s living room. The research team found more than 40,000 coins, weighing about 183 pounds in total. Some had been deposited in the necks of the jugs even after the containers were buried.\n\n“Contrary to what one might think at first glance, it is not certain that these are ‘treasures’ that were hidden during a period of insecurity,” numismatist Vincent Geneviève, who studies ancient currency, said in a statement from INRAP. “Many other explanations are possible, and these deposits should be seen instead as a snapshot of complex monetary management, planned over the medium to long term, within a household or administration, capable of making deposits and withdrawals at various intervals.”\n\nAt the time, Senon was populated by the Mediomatrici tribe, whose name translates to “middle mother,” and is probably a reference to the middle goddess of the three mothers worshipped in northwest Europe during the Roman era. These Celtic people, or Gauls, lived in the region during the Gallic Wars, when Julius Caesar’s forces conquered parts of Belgium, France, and Switzerland between 57 and 50 B.C.E. Caesar fought the Gauls when a subgroup known as the Helveti (from what is now Switzerland) began to migrate and clash with Roman allies. According to Caesar’s own account of the Gallic Wars, Celts near the Rhine (probably including the Mediomatrici) clashed with German tribes.\n\nThe vessels and coin hoards found by the reasearcher date from much later, around the late 3rd to early 4th century C.E. Geneviève found some 23,000 to 24,000 coins in the first amphora (weighing a total of 83 pounds), and 18,000 to 19,000 in the second amphora (weighing a total of 110 pounds). Only three coins remained in the third vessel.\n\nResearchers who found coins stuck to the outer face of one vessel realized that they had been added to the hoard before the pit was filled with sediment. The Mediomatrici settlement in which the vessels were found had been burned to the ground in the 4th century and rebuilt, only to be reduced to ashes again, and these artifacts were there before the fires. That can only mean that they had been there before the Romans conquered.\n\nBecause the reserves of coins were buried between 280 and 310 C.E., it is thought that they may be associated with the Roman military occupation at Senon—whether they belonged to Roman warriors or Mediomatrici, however, is unclear. The artifacts were buried at a time when urban growth began to trigger a shift in building practices and materials, and the living space, as a result, was made of limestone bricks (limestone was a plentiful resource in this part of France at the time). Rooms are separated by brick walls, with multiple pits that may have been latrines or spaces for storage. What they were actually used for will be determined by lab analysis.\n\nIt seems that Senon was heavily influenced by its Roman conquerors. Impressions on the coins appear stylistically Roman, and the ruins at the site reflect an affluent city with a public square, courtyards, temples, baths, and even a theater. Its inhabitants may have been artists or merchants. INRAP officials, therefore, do not think that there was a rush to bury these coins because of impending disaster. The fact that the tops of the amphorae were almost at ground level indicates that they were supposed to be easily accessible for deposits or withdrawals.\n\n“Their exceptional nature lies less in the discovery of a large quantity of coins (some thirty coin hoards are known in the Meuse department alone) than in the possibility of documenting their depositional context so precisely,” Geneviève said, “which is rare.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Sanctions have forced Russia to lean heavily on China to keep its economy afloat.\n\nChina ships high-tech goods to Russia and buys its oil cheap — a combo that boosts Beijing's leverage.\n\nRussia's role has shrunk to junior partner as China gains economic influence.\n\nMoscow's wartime pivot to Beijing has helped keep Russia's economy afloat under the weight of sweeping Western sanctions — but at a cost.\n\nWhat looks like a lifeline today may lock Moscow into a long-term role as Beijing's junior economic partner. Russia is now heavily dependent on China for key manufactured goods and advanced inputs blocked by Western sanctions, according to a report from the Atlantic Council, a think tank, published on Friday.\n\n\"Economically and politically, Russia's relationship with China is simultaneously deeply asymmetrical and mutually beneficial,\" wrote Elina Ribakova, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Lucas Risinger, an economic analyst and nonresident research fellow at the Kyiv School of Economics Institute.\n\nChina buys up Russian oil at volumes that offset lost European customers — at a discount — while Russia buys machinery, vehicles, and electronics from the East Asian giant amid Western boycotts and sanctions.\n\n\"This is a complete and embarrassing reversal in the relationship compared to the 2000s, when Russia exported higher value-added goods to China,\" wrote the analysts.\n\nSince Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the Kremlin has steered the country's economy into a wartime footing. Heavy defense and government spending help sustain topline resilience, despite sanctions and export restrictions.\n\nBut cracks are emerging as energy export revenues have fallen sharply in a low oil-price environment. Consumer demand has also weakened amid still high inflation.\n\nChina now accounts for a large share of Russia's imports, and the vast majority of its trade with China is settled in the Chinese yuan.\n\nRussia became China's top crude oil supplier in 2023, but the country accounts for just one-fifth of China's imports of the commodity. Meanwhile, oil and gas revenues account for a substantial one-third of Russia's budget inflows.\n\nTo be sure, China needs global buyers for its massive manufacturing sector, and Russia has become one of them. Still, the gains are \"far more important to Russia than to China,\" since Beijing doesn't rely on Moscow the way Europe relied on Russian energy, wrote the analysts.",

    "title": "Adapt This Japanese Productivity Model to Get More Done",
    "description": "To increase your productivity, you need to eliminate the \"waste\" in your workday.",
    "fullText": "So many great productivity hacks come from the Japanese manufacturing industry. The 5S technique helps you keep your workspace clean so you can get more done, kaizen helps you improve the processes and workflow of your job, and kanban helps you schedule your tasks in the most efficient way. These are helpful even if you’re not working within the famed Toyota Production System; they’re adaptable to fit all kinds of work scenarios, which is similarly true for the 3 Ms that originated there, too. The 3 Ms are kinds of waste you should identify and eliminate to keep your work running smoothly. Once you learn how to identify and get rid of them, you can be even more productive, whether you're using kanban, kaizen, or anything else.\n\nLean process thinking, or lean manufacturing, is a production method that seeks to save time within the production process. The 5S technique is en elemental part of lean thinking, as are the 3 Ms. They are \"muda,\" \"mura,\" and \"muri,\" and they all refer to kinds of wasteful practices that slow you down and keep you from being productive.\n\nHere’s what each of the three Ms is all about:\n\nMuda translates from Japanese to mean “futility” or “uselessness.” It’s anything that doesn’t add value to the work you’re doing and it comes in two forms: Type 1 is non-value-added activities in your process that are still necessary for your end result, like safety checks, which don’t give the producers of physical goods any kind of financial reward, but do have a benefit for customers and eliminate financial risk for producers. You can’t really avoid Type 1, but you should focus on identifying and eliminating Type 2: Activities that add no value to the process or the end result.\n\nMura is any kind of unevenness in your operation. Anything that isn’t uniform, regular, or scheduled is mura. Too much mura will result in muda. For instance, if you’re working on a bunch of tasks for a project at your job and your coworker is only working on one or two, it’s actually wasteful because you’ll be waiting around on them to keep moving forward with yours.\n\nMuri is any overburden on a tool or person. It can result from mura, as in the example above, but can also spring from overutilization. For your purposes, think of it referring to you. When you’re overwhelmed and overworked or lack resources, you’re not as productive. That’s muri.\n\nTo eliminate muda, identify which unnecessary steps you’re taking in your work. Familiarize yourself with kaizen here, as it’s a process designed to get you to work efficiently. If you find that you’re often doing unnecessary tasks that don’t have much value in the end, like changing the colors and fonts on a presentation deck that’s already completed or constantly tweaking your emails before sending, consider that you might be giving yourself too much time to do them. Parkinson’s Law says that the more time you have to do something, the longer you’ll draw it out and complicate it. Reduce the amount of time you give yourself to complete certain tasks so the pressure of getting it done helps you focus only on the elements that are absolutely necessary.\n\nTo eliminate mura, start tracking the process of your work and identify what’s holding you up. Is it waiting on client emails? Is it waiting for a coworker to finish their section of a project? Is it spending too much time in meetings and not enough time actually working? Is it a bad scheduling technique on your end? It might take a few weeks of diligent time tracking, but eventually, the pattern will emerge. If you’re spending too much time waiting on client emails, develop a system whereby you send emails with questions for the next day’s work during the afternoon, giving them time to respond by the time you need to do it, for instance. If it’s your own poor scheduling, start making better to-do lists using kanban or the 1-3-5 method, which reduces your daily tasks to just nine and has you focus on the most essential ones in order of importance.\n\nFinally, to eliminate muri, assess your own burden at work. If you’re missing deadlines, feeling overwhelmed, not being given the right amount of resources, or having too much piled on you, you need to streamline what you’re working on so you don’t completely burn out. Try using the ABCDE method to give a ranking to all of your responsibilities. The A tasks are the most important, followed by the B tasks, but you’ll feel less overwhelmed once you realize the C tasks are optional, D stands for delegate, and E stands for eliminate. Delegate tasks to someone else if you’re overburdened—and don’t do unnecessary ones at all. Some burdens, like meetings, are unavoidable, but when possible, schedule yourself at least one day a week where you have no meetings. Remember to take regular breaks to stay productive, utilizing a method like the time-tested Pomodoro technique. If that method isn't working for you, try the MIT—or most important thing—technique, which helps you reframe your perception of your to-dos around the impact they'll have, not the amount of resources they'll take. Playing around with different approaches is a little time-consuming and might seem like its own kind of waste, but it's necessary to find a system that works for you.\n\nTraining yourself to recognize and eliminate these different kinds of waste will streamline your work, reduce your burden, and keep things running more smoothly so you can actually be productive, whether you’re building a Camry or a new investor spreadsheet.",

    "title": "My Nine Favorite Productivity Methods in One Efficient List",
    "description": "These techniques will help you get more done without stressing about how to make it happen.",
    "fullText": "A good productivity method can mean the difference between a disorganized, unfulfilling day and one during which you get a lot done and feel great about it. That tradeoff is why so many of these methods, techniques, and hacks exist. Some are over 100 years old, some were accidentally discovered by everyday people looking to improve their lives, and some come from self-styled gurus who publish entire books on their findings.\n\nAnd some are better than others—though maybe not objectively. To find the one that works best for you, take a look through this guide to seven of my favorites. Notably, these are the ones I like, but there are plenty out there for you to consider, too. Try one that sounds like a strong match for how you think and work (or try to avoid work).\n\nThe idea of a \"Power Hour\" comes from Adrienne Herbert’s book, Power Hour: How to Focus on Your Goals and Create a Life You Love and asks you to devote an hour a day to working hard on your biggest task—or the thing you care about the most. Sometimes, this is a must-do task that will have major ramifications for your life, like filling out job applications or working on homework. In that case, what you care about most is your overall goal of improvement. Other times, it might be a personal project or passion that you want to carve out time to pursue, which will enhance your life, make you feel happier, and make you more productive that way. The trick is committing—truly committing—to taking that hour every day, upending your schedule if necessary.\n\nHere's my fuller rundown of the approach, which I have started putting into practice in my own life with great results.\n\nOf all the techniques on the list, this might be the one I use (or adapt) most often. Essentially, when there's a small, mundane, or tedious task that doesn't excite you, but won't take more than 10 minutes to do, you just do it. Just do it. That's it. It sounds easy, but it's not, since these are also those tasks you're more likely to put off and ignore, like answering emails or doing the dishes. Fighting against that impulse, committing to just doing these things when you think of them, and then getting them done is hard at first, but becomes a habit over time—and it's one with a lot of benefits. I do this when I'm cleaning my apartment. Instead of laboring over some cleaning checklist or structured plan (which is helpful for a lot of people), I just take on a task when I notice it needs to be done. Then, not only does it simply get done, which is the point, but I feel a sense of motivation and contentment. Since I started doing this, my home has never been cleaner, even though I'm not following any strict guidelines besides \"just do it.\"\n\nI also couple this with another favorite—the \"one more\" trick, which involves asking yourself, \"Can I do one more?\" every time you finish a small task. The answer is usually yes and when it becomes no, you give yourself the grace to stop. Just knowing you don't have to, but you can do something can be motivating enough.\n\nHere's a longer explainer on the 10-minute rule.\n\nThis method is one of my favorites for keeping on task when I’m juggling multiple projects. It calls on you to organize your tasks into three categories: Action steps, references, and back-burners. Once you’ve done that, you put it all into a spreadsheet with those three categories as the column headers. You slot tasks into each column alongside notes, supplemental material, and whatever else you need—and move them around as they change their designations, as what is a back-burner today might be an action step tomorrow. Organizing it all this way helps you keep on top of the most pressing needs. \n\nHere’s a full explanation of how to employ the Action Method. (The “ABC” method is very similar, with “A” tasks being must-do and high-priority, “B” tasks being should-do activities, and “C” tasks being low-priority ones.)\n\nUsing this technique, you aim to plan your day in threes: Spend your first three hours engaging in deep work on your most important project, then complete three other urgent tasks that require less time, and then do three “maintenance” tasks, like answering emails or scheduling other work. This method works because you do your deep, focused work up-front, which gets you in the zone and gives you a sense of accomplishment and makes tackling the stuff afterward easier. I like this one on days I need a touch of structure. I use a prioritization method—usually MIT, which forces me to think of my responsibilities in terms of the impact they'll have on my life, but sometimes one like the Eisenhower matrix—to figure out which category all of my to-dos belong in, then follow the guidelines to make sure they all get done. I typically pull this one out when I have a big project and am struggling to think of how I'll get it all done. Even breaking one large task down into three hours of hard work, three urgent components, and three \"maintenance\" tasks helps everything flow a little easier.\n\nHere’s a guide to planning your day in threes.\n\nSimilar to 3-3-3, the “Eat the Frog” method invites you to tackle work on your biggest, scariest, wartiest task first thing in the morning. Whatever time-intensive task that has kept you up at night is, that’s what you should do first. It's similar to Power Hour in that you're supposed to do it early in the day, but different in that this may not be your most important or passion-fueled project. After that, everything else should be easier. While most proponents argue you should “eat the frog” as soon as you wake up, this method can work on any schedule as long as you commit to jumping into the hard thing early, enthusiastically, and without hesitation, thus freeing up the rest of your day for other work and lowering your overall stress level. When I use this one, I specify it a little more. If cleaning my kitchen is the most demanding task of the day, that doesn't mean I should do it the second I wake up, but when I get home from work or errands. It wouldn't make sense to postpone leaving for the day to do that, but it does make sense to turn it into the \"first thing\" I do when I'm in the relevant space, as it makes the rest of my time in the home for the evening better.\n\nHere’s a guide to eating your first frog, so to speak.\n\nKanban is similar to the Action Method but requires you to label your tasks as to-do, doing, and done. It works best when managed in a spreadsheet or even on a big board with sticky notes, but you need the three columns so you can move whatever is completed into your “done” pile and anything that still needs doing into “to-do.” If you’re a visual person, this is going to be a game-changer, as it helps you easily see what needs to be done, and gives you some satisfaction when you see what you’ve already accomplished piling up under “done.”\n\nHere’s a guide to implementing the Kanban productivity method.\n\nAnother trick for the visually inclined and motivated, timeboxing requires you to schedule your entire day. Every activity, from answering emails, to working on a big project, to eating a snack, should go on your calendar. It’s much easier to use a digital calendar, like Google Calendar, for this, since so much of the average day is subject to change and it’s simpler to move things around there than in a physical planner, but try not to deviate from the schedule too much just because deviation is a drag-and-drop away. The idea behind this method is that it allows you to plan to devote exactly as much time to each task as you need to complete it while still filling your entire day with activity. There are a lot of tricks that go along with this one, and once you start, you may go down the productivity technique rabbit hole. For instance, Parkinson's Law dictates that the more time you give yourself to work on something, the longer you'll naturally take—which makes you less productive by reducing the quality of your work over time and stopping you from working on other things. With timeboxing, you can and should practice cutting off time from all your boxes, giving yourself less time to work overall. In the gaps you ultimately create, don't forget to take a break. Those are also essential to productivity.\n\nHere’s a guide to getting started with timeboxing.\n\nThis is an old standby that has withstood the test of time because it works so well: Work for 25 minutes on a task, take a short break of about five minutes, and work for 25 minutes again. Every time you complete four 25-minute cycles, take a longer break. This gets you into the groove of working hard in those 25-minute bursts, since you know a little reprieve is coming. The break recharges you and you get back at it, over and over again, until your job is complete. To maximize the benefits of Pomodoro, get a specialized timer so you don't have to set alarms on your phone and can work without glancing at it and all its distracting apps. On the other hand, an app might be just what you need. I love Focus Pomo, a Pomodoro technique-specific app that blocks all your other ones during \"focus sessions.\" If you're not finding this approach helpful after a few consistent attempts, don't be afraid to adapt it, either. The standard 25 minutes on and five off work well for a lot of people, but you might need shorter or longer work or break sessions. What matters most is that you time them out, commit to taking breaks, and then commit to getting back at it.\n\nHere’s a guide to getting started with the Pomodoro method.\n\nThis technique comes from famed motivational speaker Tony Robbins, who designed it to be motivational, fast, and efficient. Not only does does the acronym stand for Rapid Planning Method, but it can also serve as a guide to what your day should look like: Results-oriented, purpose-driven, and built around a \"massive action plan.\"\n\nConsistently—every morning or week—ask yourself these three questions:\n\nWhat do I need to do/What is my massive action plan?",

    "description": "Engineer Limhi Somerville joins the California-based company from what may be its largest United Kingdom competitor.",
    "fullText": "California-based electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi developer Archer Aviation is putting down roots on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company revealed its plans to build an engineering hub in South West England that will be operated by a new subsidiary, Archer Aviation UK Limited. The move adds to its primary manufacturing facility in Covington, Georgia, which could also be complemented by production capabilities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n\"The U.K. has the talent and industrial base to be a major player in driving the next era of advanced aerospace and defence,\" said Adam Goldstein, Archer's founder and CEO. \"Archer's plans to open a U.K. engineering hub underscores our commitment to being an integral part of the next-generation of aerospace and defence in the country.\"\n\nArcher also poached engineer Limhi Somerville from what would be its largest U.K. competitor-Vertical Aerospace, which last week unveiled its flagship eVTOL, Valo.\n\nLike Archer's Midnight, Valo is designed to carry up to four passengers on zero-emission flights in urban settings, producing a fraction of the noise of a helicopter. Somerville spent six years with Vertical and led its development of electric batteries and powertrains, most recently serving as director of engineering. He will join Archer's team in early 2026, the company said.\n\nAcquiring team members from competitors is a blueprint the company has deployed before. Earlier this year, for example, George Kivork, the former head of U.S. state and local policy for rival Joby Aviation, joined Archer as a general manager for the Los Angeles region.\n\nHowever, the strategy has gotten the company in some hot water. Joby in November sued both Archer and Kivork, alleging that its competitor used trade secrets from Kivork to undercut an exclusive deal it had planned to finalize. Archer has rejected the allegations.\n\nWisk Aero, the eVTOL arm of Boeing, sued Archer in 2021, also alleging that a former employee stole trade secrets. Archer promptly countersued. The companies ultimately settled for an undisclosed amount, and Boeing made an investment intended to fund the integration of Wisk's autonomy technology on future variants of Midnight.\n\nMidnight is a piloted, four-passenger eVTOL model with a cruise speed of about 150 mph, designed for 10-20-minute, 20-50 sm trips. Its six electric battery packs each power a pair of motors and propellers, half of which are capable of tilting to support both hover and forward flight.\n\nIn the U.S., Archer is working with United Airlines-which placed an order for up to 200 aircraft-and Southwest Airlines to build air taxi networks in major urban centers. It has shared potential route maps for New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, where it recently acquired Hawthorne Municipal Airport (KHHR) for $126 million.",

    "fullText": "(This is an excerpt of the Health Rounds newsletter, where we present latest medical studies on Tuesdays and Thursdays)\n\nDec 17 (Reuters) - Applying an insecticide treatment used for soldiers’ uniforms to the cloths used to carry babies significantly reduced incidence of malaria in the ​children, researchers found.\n\nThe six-month study conducted in regions of Uganda where malaria is endemic included 400 mothers and their babies, ages 6 ‌months to 18 months. Half were randomly assigned to use cotton cloth wraps treated with Sawyer Products’ permethrin, while the others received cloths treated with plain water as a control group. ‌The wraps underwent retreatment every 4 weeks.\n\nAll of the pairs received insecticide-treated sleeping nets.\n\nThe permethrin-treated baby wraps reduced malaria cases in infants by 66%, according to a report of the study published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAdverse events were mild, and the frequency was low and similar in the treatment group and the sham group, the report said.\n\n“Given the anticipated duration and frequency of use... extended follow-up of children, particularly for neurodevelopmental effects of permethrin exposure, is needed,” the researchers ⁠acknowledge.\n\n“Yet malaria, both severe and uncomplicated forms, can cause ‌long-term cognitive impairment, and a careful weighing of potential risks and benefits will be required.”\n\nAI REQUIRES NUANCED TRAINING TO FIND CANCER IN LOWER-RISK GROUPS\n\nTwo recent studies highlight the potential for artificial intelligence tools to be less accurate in some patients ‍than others, if the tools are not trained properly.\n\nIt’s well known that if AI tools are trained on data collected from unequal proportions of patients from various demographic groups, they have a harder time making an accurate diagnosis in minority groups that aren’t well-represented in the training set.\n\nBut in the current analysis, the models sometimes performed worse in ​one demographic group even when the sample sizes were comparable, researchers reported in Cell Reports Medicine.\n\nThe reason may be that some cancers are more ‌common in certain groups, so the models become better at making a diagnosis in those groups. As a result, the models may have difficulty diagnosing cancers in populations where they aren’t as common, the researchers discovered.\n\nIn addition, subtle molecular differences may exist in biopsy samples from different demographic groups, and AI may detect those differences and use them as a proxy for cancer type, potentially making it less effective at diagnosis in populations in which these mutations are less common.\n\n“We found that because AI is so powerful, it can differentiate many obscure biological signals that cannot be detected by standard human evaluation,” study ⁠leader Kun-Hsing Yu of Harvard Medical School said in a statement.\n\nAs a result, the models ​may pick up signals that are more related to demographics than disease - and inferring demographic ​information from pathology slides could affect their diagnostic ability across groups.\n\nTogether, Yu said, these explanations suggest that bias in pathology AI stems not only from the variable quality of the training data but also from how researchers train the models.\n\nWhen his ‍team applied a new framework to the ⁠models they'd tested, it reduced the diagnostic disparities by some 88%, they said.\n\n“We show that by making this small adjustment, the models can learn robust features that make them more generalizable and fairer across different populations,” Yu said.\n\nThe finding is encouraging, he added, because it suggests ⁠that bias can be reduced even without training the models on completely fair, representative data.\n\nIn a separate study published in PLOS Biology, researchers found that even with broad samples of bacterial ‌populations, bias may be blocking the potential of AI to predict and combat antibiotic resistance.\n\n(To receive the full newsletter in your ‌inbox for free",

    "description": "Aldi is a popular grocery store that frequently features unique products and has a loyal customer base. But do you know where its US headquarters is located?",
    "fullText": "As far as bargain grocery stores go in the United States, Aldi is a haven for budget-conscious shoppers. Across the country, the German-founded grocery store is known for its low-cost items, international products, and even for being much better than Trader Joe's for some unexpected items. What you may not know is that its headquarters is based in one unlikely Midwestern city: Batavia, Illinois.\n\nBatavia is almost an hour drive from the densely populated neighboring city, Chicago. While the Windy City is known for having a large number of Aldi locations, Batavia is home to only one Aldi store, which happens to be located near headquarters based on N. Kirk Rd.  Headquarters has undergone a few developments over the years to improve space and facilities for staff members. The company's campus renovations and expansion reflect the desire for growth in both stores and staffing. The German-based grocery chain has come a long way since being founded in 1946 and has a multitude of Aldi stores worldwide with accelerated growth being planned. Aldi headquarters is where much of the plans are made to maintain growth, including the decision to open 800 stores by 2028.\n\nEveryday low prices are championed at Aldi no matter where you are in the country (although some store locations are known to be cheaper than others). Headquarters serve as the company's hub for the 2,600 stores scattered across the country, most of which are found in southern states and on the east coast. While headquarters' location may not immediately seem obvious when held up against the country's bigger and more populated cities, it does align with the chain's roots, which opened its very first store in Iowa. The grocery store already has a great reputation in this region, which keeps Midwestern shoppers continuously coming back.\n\nEven if some people have valid reasons for avoiding Aldi for their shopping, in the Midwestern states, it's fair to say that Aldi is beloved by many. Shoppers have said the quality of the goods are much better in Illinois than in other areas like New England. Most Aldi shoppers are generally pleased with the quality of produce and locally sourced meat, too. Overall, the choice of location for headquarters might not be the first guess for many, but it fits in with the chain's tradition and good reputation earned in the Midwestern part of the country.\n\nWant more food knowledge?

    "fullText": "YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (MyValleyTributes) – Mr. Lee Thompson Rucker, Sr., 98 of Mount Juliet, Tennessee, formerly of Youngstown, Ohio, peacefully entered eternal rest on Sunday, December 7, 2025, at TriStar Summit Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nMr. Rucker, affectionately known as “Tommy”, was born on November 28, 1927, in Elberton, Georgia, a son of Robert and Alice Thompson Rucker. Lee was one of ten children.\n\nFind obituaries from your high school\n\nAt the age of 13, he moved from Georgia to Youngstown, Ohio, embracing hard work early and carrying a deep love for his family that guided every step of his life. That sense of responsibility, strength and quiet perseverance shaped the man he would become and remained evident throughout his long life.\n\nWhile living in Youngstown, Lee met the love of his life, Marion Gidney and together they built a beautiful marriage rooted in faith, devotion and generosity. Their union lasted until Marion’s passing and continues to live on through the generations they raised.\n\nA dedicated worker and respected presence in his community, Lee retired from the City of Youngstown Sanitation Department after more than 25 years of service, beginning as a truck driver and later becoming a supervisor. He also worked for over 20 years at the Youngstown Country Club, where he was known for his warm spirit, kindness and steady professionalism.\n\nLee’s faith was a guiding force throughout his life. He was a devoted member of Pilgrim Baptist Church in Struthers, worshiping faithfully under the leadership of his son, the late Pastor Lee T. Rucker, Jr. Before joining Pilgrim, he served for many years at Centenary United Methodist Church of Youngstown, where he was a dedicated usher who greeted others with kindness. He was also a proud member of the Masons, Covenant Lodge 59, dedicating many years to the fraternity and the values it represents.\n\nA man rich in both skills and heart, Lee loved gardening, cooking, was well known for his famous pound and carrot cake (a staple at gatherings and a sweet symbol of his care for others) and the neighborhood handyman. A true sports enthusiast, he spent many Sunday afternoons watching games, during his last days he enjoyed playing pool, coloring and painting pictures and sewing.\n\nLee will be remembered as a family hero, a man who carried life’s challenges with grace, loved without hesitation and remained sharp, witty and full of spirit well into his later years. His legacy is etched in the lives of his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and the many others who were blessed by his presence.\n\nHe leaves to honor his memory his daughter, Sharon (Winfred) Bourn of Lebanon, Tennessee; his brother, Ulyses Rucker of Youngstown; grandchildren, Jamie (Jenna) Rucker, Harold (Joi) Rucker, Jr., Deanna (William) Dobbins, Alton (Tamara) Johnson, III, Gregory (Jasmyn) Bourn and Travis Bourn; a host of great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren across the country, daughters-in-law, Dorothy “Dee” Rucker of Girard, Ohio and Evonne Rucker of Charlotte, North Carolina; brother-in-law, Willard (Michelle) Gidney of Youngstown; along with a loving host of nieces, nephews, extended family, church family, neighbors and lifelong friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Marion, whom he married June 6, 1952 and who passed away April 4, 2016; his sons, Harold Rucker, Sr. and Lee T. Rucker, Jr.; his parents and siblings, Eberhart, James, Lish “LH”,  David Vernon, Julian, Bobbie Downer, Willie Sue Banks and Alethia Gaither.\n\nThe family is forever thankful for the loving care provided by Pat and Jim Greene, Pastor Mark and First Lady Sandra Parks and the Pilgrim Baptist Church family, Judy Gidney, the rehabilitation facility-Windsor House at Liberty, Rutland Place Senior Facility and its therapy staff, who cared for him with genuine affection; the residents of Park Vista, who always looked out for him, TriStar Summit Medical Center and the compassionate nurses of Gentiva Hospice Care.\n\nVisitation will be from 10:00  – 11:00 a.m., on Saturday, December 20, 2025, at the Pilgrim Baptist Church, 67 McClure Street, Struthers, OH 44471. A Celebration of Life will follow at 11:00 a.m.\n\nMinistry of comfort, love and dignity have been entrusted to L.E. Black, Phillips & Holden Funeral Home.\n\nTo honor the deep love and legacy he leaves behind, we share this Scripture: “Children’s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.” — Proverbs 17:6 (KJV)\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of Lee T. “Tommy” Rucker, Sr, please visit our floral store.\n\nA television tribute will air Thursday, December 18 at the following approximate times: 7:10 a.m. on FOX, 12:22 p.m. on WKBN, 5:08 p.m. on MyYTV and 7:27 p.m. on WYTV.

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s game against Bournemouth on Monday resembled a boxing match at times, with both sides trading blows, as a thoroughly entertaining encounter ended 4-4.\n\nIt was great for the neutrals, not so much for Ruben Amorim, as he saw his team relinquish their lead on three separate occasions.\n\nThe lack of control in midfield saw the head coach sub off Casemiro, despite his goal in the first half. He received a caution which will rule him out of next weekend’s clash against Aston Villa.\n\nThe Brazilian usually runs out of gas in games, as evidenced by the fact that he has played the full 90 minutes only three times this term.\n\nThe 33-year-old has managed to win over Amorim, but not INEOS, who have decided against triggering the one-year extension option in his current deal.\n\nThe Red Devils remain open to offering the Brazil international a new deal, but on lower wages, something the former Real Madrid superstar might not agree to.\n\nHe is free to agree a new pre-contract with foreign clubs from January, and plenty of Saudi Pro League sides remain interested.\n\nThey can offer the five-time Champions League winner bucket loads of cash, but as per The Daily Mail, the defensive midfielder looks to be headed across the Atlantic instead.\n\nThe report states that even if United were to offer him a new deal, a move to the MLS (Major League Soccer) seems to be his most likely destination.\n\n“Casemiro is United’s highest earner on £375,000 a week, and the club have so far shown little interest in triggering a one-year extension as they look to drive down the wage bill.\n\n“Unless that situation changes, the Brazil star will be out of contract on June 30 and free to speak to foreign clubs over a summer move in just 16 days’ time.\n\n“One option would be for United to offer Casemiro a new contract on less money, after he re-established himself as a starter alongside Fernandes this season.\n\n“Otherwise, Confidential understands Major League Soccer in the US is emerging as the most likely destination for the former Real Madrid man, who cost United £70m when he arrived from the Bernabeu on a four-year deal in 2022.”\n\nCasemiro has worked hard to establish himself as a starter under Amorim, and losing his experience and winning mentality will be a huge blow.\n\nBut the Old Trafford side needs fresh legs, and hopefully, INEOS can find a suitable replacement before letting the midfield stalwart go. Or else, Amorim will be fuming.\n\nFeature image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nIn an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.\n\nBogut’s 2004-05 sophomore campaign with the Utes placed him into an exclusive club of college basketball history, as he led the program to the Sweet 16 in the years immediately after longtime head coach and program builder Rick Majerus left the program and received consensus national player of the year honors as a result.\n\nIn the Utes’ first season under Ray Giacolletti, Bogut averaged 20.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game to lead the team to a 25-4 regular season record overall, with a 13-1 mark in Mountain West play. Bogut’s most impressive outing of the season was a 31-point, 13-rebound clinic in a 71-62 conference win over Wyoming on Valentine’s Day, where he made 11-of-16 attempts from the field.\n\nThe Utes would eventually fall to New Mexico in the 2005 Mountain West championship game, but still received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament as an at-large. Bogut continued his dominance in the first round of March Madness, pouring in 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting to lead Utah over a feisty No. 11 seed in UTEP before beating No. 3 seed Oklahoma in the Round of 32.\n\nIn the days after Bogut’s college career ended with a loss to Kentucky in the 2005 Sweet 16, he was awarded the Wooden Award with a decisive finish in the voting ahead of Duke’s JJ Redick and Illinois’ Dee Brown. Being from Australia, Bogut wasn’t too familiar with Coach Wooden’s legacy when he won the award but he still cherished the honor all the same.\n\n\"I'd heard the name before. College basketball isn't very big in Australia,\" Bogut told the Associated Press after winning the award in 2005. \"He's a legendary coach -- one of the best of all-time … It's very special just to have my name engraved on that trophy with the likes of Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan.”\n\nBogut joined another very exclusive club in basketball history a few months later, as the Milwaukee Bucks selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Bogut played 14 seasons in the NBA, winning a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015 in addition to earning third-team All-NBA honors with the Bucks in 2010.",

    "description": "There’s a good reason why neutrals watching the game on Sunday were rooting for Sunderland and not the Saudi Boys from up the road…",
    "fullText": "Days like Sunday don’t come along very often, but when they do, you are reminded of why you love your team and you love football.\n\nSunderland were absolutely outstanding against Newcastle in the first Premier League meeting in a decade, and whilst it wasn’t a startling game of football, there can be no doubt that the Lads in red and white were deserved winners and looked more than good enough value for the three points. The fact that there doesn’t seem to be a Newcastle pundit doing anything other than admit they were rightful losers says it all.\n\nIt was one of the most determined and spirited defensive displays that I’ve seen from any Sunderland side, and every single person watching could see that this is a special team that is determined to fight every single second for the supporters and the badge. When you think about the derby games and how you want your team to play, I think what we got from our lads is exactly what you’d want — they were mean, aggressive, understood the importance of the occasion, and they delivered the type of performance that makes you proud.\n\nIt feels poetic to me that in the last decade Sunderland have been relegated twice, spent four seasons in League One, have almost gone bust, had to completely rebuild ourselves, and still we’re superior to our neighbours up the road who sold their souls to the devil – the ultimate price for “success”.\n\nAnd for what? Nobody likes them.\n\nNo neutral watching that game wanted to see Newcastle United emerge victorious. Their arrogance and delusion has annoyed everyone the length and bredth for the country — no matter what the mags might believe in their own heads, they are no one’s second favourite team. They’re a laughing stock, and to lose in the manner that they did has led to widespread piss-taking for good reason… people want to see them with egg on their faces, and I’m not just talking about those of a red and white persuasion.\n\nSunderland have gone about their business in a fashion that has rightly earned us praise and acclaim. You watch players like Robin Roefs, Noah Sadiki, Omar Alderete, Dan Ballard, Reinildo Mandava, and Granit Xhaka and you can’t help but love them. Every fan of every team wants players who “get it”, and Sunderland’s players certainly do – it’s just such an amazing time to support this unbelievable football club, and the way they keep on delivering results and creating great moments for us supporters really is a sight to behold.\n\nSunday’s game was my favourite derby victory of all time — though, the 3-0 at St James’ Park under Gus Poyet does run it close. There is no sweeter feeling, after taking unrelenting and deserved stick for the last god knows how long from fans of “the Visitors”, than to be able to sit here knowing we are better than they are, that we beat them, and that we are above them in the table. I am going to be smiling ear to ear for the rest of this week!",

    "fullText": "Jalen Brunson didn’t have his best scoring night on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter.\n\nThe Knicks received contributions from up-and-down their bench as they pulled out a thrilling victory over the San Antonio Spurs to secure their first NBA Cup title.\n\nBrunson was named the tournament MVP, but he was sure to tip his cap to his teammates afterwards.\n\n“Without them, we don’t hold that trophy,” he said.\n\nIt starts with OG Anunoby, who led the way offensively with a game-high 28 points.\n\nAnunoby also continued his stellar all-around play on the other end of the floor, reeling in nine rebounds and earning himself Defensive Player of the Game honors.\n\n“The way he’s shooting the ball is fantastic,” Brunson said. He’s making plays and he has confidence -- when everyone is working on their game even in-season that confidence stays, so it’s a credit to him and what he’s been doing.”\n\nIt wasn’t just Anunoby, though, as big man Mitchell Robinson also stepped up with 18 outstanding minutes off the bench while Karl-Anthony Towns battled through some bruises.\n\nRobinson set an NBA Cup Final record with 10 offensive boards, and reeled in 15 in total.\n\n“That’s what Mitch does,” Towns said. “I knew playing against him just how much he impacts the game, to be his teammate now and to see what he does, he’s impacted the game how many times -- shoutout to Mitch, hell of a day at the office.”\n\nJordan Clarkson had another strong scoring night with 15 big points off the bench, but it was youngster Tyler Kolek who took advantage of the opportunity the most and truly shined on the biggest stage.\n\nKolek was leaned on heavily down the stretch and he finished with 14 points, five rebounds, five assists, and turned the ball over just once over his 20 minutes of action.\n\nIt was arguably one of his most impressive at the NBA-level.\n\n“He played big-time, I’m very happy for him,” Brunson said. “It may be a surprise to a bunch of people, but many of you see how hard this kid works and I’m just very happy for him. The way he played tonight helped us for sure, we needed him.”\n\nThe hope is that this success in big minutes can help the rest of the way in the regular season.\n\n“In a game like this where it’s basically win or go home,” the captain said. “You have guys who step up and pick up the slack for a person like me who wasn’t shooting the ball well and made a terrible second-half turnover with the back-court.\n\n“It’s when those guys come in and do that, that gives us even more confidence. That excites me more than anything, the guys who come in and do that, it gives us an opportunity to win, it’s just a great feeling.”",

    "fullText": "Bucheon FC 1995 made history, not only by winning promotion for the first time in the club's history, but also by becoming the first K League 2 side to win Promotion-Relegation Playoff 2. In other words, they became the first K League 2 side to knock off 10th in K League 1.\n\nFinishing third also means they are only the fourth team to finish outside the top two in K League 2 and win promotion, the others being Gwangju FC (4th) in 2014 and Suwon FC (3rd) in 2015, and Gangwon FC (4th) in 2016.\n\nWhat's also noteworthy about Bucheon's promotion is that they became only the third team to win both legs. But, where do Bucheon's achievements stand in the history of the playoffs? The Promotion-Relegation Playoffs began in 2013, and Sangju Sangmu were the first team to win promotion via the playoffs, while Gangwon were the first team to be relegated by them.\n\nThere have been 16 total K League 2 versus K League 1 ties (2020 had only a promotion playoff due to Sangju moving to Gimcheon). The team that won the first leg has gone on to win the tie overall on nine occasions (56%), showing just how important the first leg is.\n\nOn five occasions, this was the K League 2 team - Sangju in 2013, Gwangju in 2014, Suwon FC in 2015, Daejeon in 2022, and, of course, Bucheon in 2025.\n\nOnly two teams have won both legs before Bucheon those being Suwon FC in 2015 and Daejeon in 2022.\n\nKey: Green = K League 2 team win, orange = draw, red is K League 1 team win\n\nOnly on three occasions has the K League 2 team won the first leg and gone on to lose the tie, those being Daejeon in 2021, Busan in 2023, then Daegu last year.\n\nBut to really hammer home how special Bucheon's playoff triumph is, in the last four seasons, six out of the eight K League 1 teams have survived. Overall, seven K League 2 teams have been promoted, and nine K League 1 teams have survived.\n\nBeing only one of four teams to win promotion that finished outside the top two is no mean feat either. What history tells us about the promotion chances of the teams that don't finish first or second is that it's extremely rare.\n\nFifth only became a playoff spot in 2022 following the extension of the playoffs, from one spot to two. That year, Gyeongnam beat Bucheon but were knocked out by Anyang. In 2023, Bucheon were the away side and drew with Gyeongnam, so they were eliminated. Last year, Busan drew 0-0 away to Jeonnam and were knocked out. This season, Seongnam became the first fifth-place team to knock off fourth but were eliminated in the next phase, and no team has won promotion from fifth.\n\nIn 2022, Bucheon finished fourth, the second-to-last playoff spot, and faced Gyeongnam but lost 3-2. The following year, it was roles reversed as Gyeongnam finished fourth and Bucheon with a 0-0 draw for the Roses enough to advance, only to lose to Gimpo. Last year, Jeonnam hosted Busan and advanced via a 0-0 draw, and this year, Seoul E-Land lost 1-0 to Seongnam. No team has been promoted from this position.\n\nJeonnam Dragons finished in the last playoff spot in 2021 and went to Daejeon needing to win to advance. The game ended 0-0 and it was Daejeon who went through, eventually beating Anyang before losing to K League 1 Gangwon FC over two legs.\n\nIn 2020 the playoffs were a bit different, due to the Sangmu team moving from Sangju to Gimcheon. This meant two teams were guaranteed to go up - the K League 2 champions and the playoff winners. Daejeon finished fourth that year but drew with Gyeongnam and so were knocked out.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, only Gwangju in 2014 went up as the lowest-ranked team in the playoffs. Seoul E-Land (2015), Busan IPark (2016), Seongnam FC (2017), Gwangju (2018), Bucheon (2019), and Jeonnam (2021) all failed to do so.\n\nSecond-highest Ranked Playoff Spot\n\nThe second-highest ranked playoff spot would usually be third from 2014 until 2021, then fourth from 2022 onwards, and this is where Bucheon come in. From 2014 until this year, only two teams went up from this position. Suwon FC in 2015 and Gangwon in 2016. Bucheon are, therefore, one of only three teams out of 12 to finish in the second-highest playoff spot and win promotion. Gangwon (2014), Asan Mugunghwa (2017), Daejeon Citizen (2018, 2021), FC Anyang (2019, 2022), Gyeongnam (2020), Gimpo (2023), and Seoul E-Land (2024) all failed.\n\nSince 2022, finishing runner-up has meant a direct playoff with 11th in K League 1. Before that, runners-up got what the third-placed team gets now - home advantage in the K League 2 playoff final. So far, only Busan IPark (2019), Suwon FC (2020), and Daejeon (2022) have won promotion from the highest-ranked playoff spot. Ansan Police (2014), Daegu (2015), Bucheon (2016), Busan (2017, 2018, 2023), Anyang (2021), Chungnam Asan (2024), and Suwon Bluewings have all failed.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea claimed a hard-fought 3-1 win over Cardiff City yesterday. The Blues made it difficult for themselves with a poor first-half showing.\n\nHowever, manager Enzo Maresca rang the changes and the top guns came on, swinging momentum in Chelsea’s favour.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho came on from the bench and netted a double while Pedro Neto also scored a well-taken goal, earning the Blues a place in the semi-final.\n\nWhile Garnacho will likely (and rightly) take most of the plaudits, Neto deserves praise for a solid 25-minute cameo.\n\nThe Portuguese winger came on and helped Chelsea hold on to the ball. He also helped the West Londoners be more incisive, providing the cutting edge they lacked.\n\nHis performance earned him an 8/10 rating from Football London. They wrote, “The hero. His sixth goal of the season. Mr Reliable for the Blues.”\n\nNeto has been criticised by Chelsea fans for his lack of end product and decision-making in the final third, but continues to deliver the goods and shut out all the noise.\n\nHis defensive work rate and non-stop running will make him a mainstay of this Chelsea team for years to come.\n\nThe excitement of on-loan stars like Geovany Quenda and Kendry Paez has led many to believe that the Blues can do away with Neto, but he continues to prove his worth.\n\nThe West Londoners take on Newcastle United this weekend, and Neto is expected to reclaim his starting berth. He will hope to continue his excellent run of form.\n\nYoungster Estevao Willian is reportedly dealing with a muscle issue and won’t be available to provide cover for Neto.\n\nHis absence will be a massive blow for the Blues as they bid to consolidate their hold on fourth place on the Premier League table with a win over struggling Newcastle.",

    "fullText": "It’s the final group stage round of the 2025-26 season in the UEFA Women’s Champions League. Another situation in which a draw for Chelsea Women won’t suffice. The Blues must win this match if they want “smooth sailing” into the competition’s knockout rounds as they sit third in the league table, but with few points separating them from several other teams right behind them.\n\nThis pack of “chasers” includes our opponents, who are a regular thorn on our side. They might not be as much of a powerhouse as they once were. However they remain a tough nut to crack, especially when playing with home support.\n\nDate / Time: Wednesday, December 17, 2025, 20.00 GMT; 3pm EST\nVenue: AOK Stadion, Wolfsburg, Germany\nReferee: Silvia Gasperotti (on pitch); Valerio Marini (VAR)\nForecast: Cloudy\n\nOn TV: none (US); none (UK); elsewhere\nStreaming: ESPN+, Paramount+, fuboTV (US); Disney+ (UK)\n\nWolfsburg team news: It was a summer of rebuilding for the German outfit, with several key players such as defender Kathrin Hendrich, goalkeeper Merle Frohms and attacking midfielder Jule Brand leaving the club at the end of their respective contracts. To make up for these exits Wolfsburg had to go into the market, bringing in the likes of Brighton defender Guro Bergsvand and Paris FC forward Kessya Bussy to fill in the gaps.\n\nAt least fitness hasn’t been an issue for them as the hosts have no major injury concerns for the squad that will face Chelsea. Hooray!… for them.\n\nChelsea team news: Beating Brighton in a Women’s Super League match wasn’t a special occasion. It was still notable as it put Chelsea back on a winning streak, albeit a very short one, following a rather weird stretch of three winless games for the blues.\n\nThe Blues will be missing defender Nathalie Björn whose hamstring injury means she’ll be sidelined for a few weeks at least. There are good news regarding Hannah Hampton with the goalkeeper listed in the squad that travelled to Germany. But according to Sonia Bompastor she remains happy with her immediate substitute, Livia Peng.\n\nPreviously: Superb efficiency in front of goal gets us a 3-0 win over the German side at their turf.",

Kick-off is set for 7.30pm GMT.\n\nViewers in the UK can watch the match live on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Ultra HDR, with coverage starting at 7pm GMT. Subscribers can also stream the action online via NOWTV.\n\nIf you’re not a Sky customer, you can grab a NOWTV Day Pass here to watch without a subscription.\n\nWinger Jeremy Doku will presumably face a late fitness test after missing the match against Palace with a leg injury, though Guardiola did not elaborate on the extent of the issue, so the Belgian could miss more matches.\n\nOmar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri will be absent for the hosts due to Afcon, with both making a return at some point in January. This match will likely come too soon for Rodri and John Stones, both of whom are expected back closer to Christmas, while Mateo Kovacic remains the club’s only long-term injury absentee.\n\nFor Brentford, Joshua Dasilva, Antoni Milambo and Fabio Carvalho are the long-term absentees, while Dango Ouattara and Frank Onyeka are missing due to Afcon duty.\n\nKevin Schade is suspended and will return for the weekend Premier League game, while Reiss Nelson will be assessed but this match should come a little too soon for the attacker.\n\nMan City XI: Donnarumma; Nunes, Khusanov, Gvardiol, Ake; Lewis, Gonzalez, Reijnders; Savinho, Haaland, Foden.\n\nBrentford XI: Kelleher; Kayode, Collins, van den Berg, Hickey; Henderson, Janelt; Damsgaard, Jensen, Lewis-Potter; Thiago.",

    "title": "Sienna Betts makes her college debut for No. 4 UCLA in 87 point blowout of Cal Poly",
    "description": "Freshman forward Sienna Betts, sister of Lauren Betts, made her long awaited debut in a historically high scoring game by the Bruins.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - No. 4 UCLA had by far their best scoring game of the season Tuesday night when they took to the court against the Cal Poly Mustangs and turned in one of their best defensive performances too, finishing the game with a massive 115-28 final score in favor of the Bruins.\n\nIt was UCLA's first triple digit finish of the season and the 87 point margin of victory was the fourth-largest in program history and the largest in the NCAA era.\n\nWhat made the Bruins eclipsing the 100-point threshold that much more impactful was the player who did it. With just under seven minutes to go, freshman forward Sienna Betts spun, stepped back and sank a midrange shot for her fifth point of the game and UCLA's 101st.\n\nBetts, the younger sister of superstar UCLA senior center Lauren Betts, made her long-awaited debut Tuesday night after being kept out of the season so far with an injury. She was subbed in midway through the first quarter and Pauley Pavilion roared as over a month of anticipation was finally released.\n\nFor the Betts sisters, it was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.\n\n\"I just felt super jolly. I was just so happy to be on the court with her. She's just done a lot of work and I know that this process hasn't been easy, but just to have that moment with her, this is something that we've grown up dreaming about, so to be at this level and to be on the court with her is really amazing.\"\n\nIt's been a long road to this point for the younger Betts. Close has spoken at length this season about the drive that Betts has and the disappointment that Betts has felt not being able to be on the court. Still just a freshman, that intense drive can be a spark plug for success, but it can also be straining mentally. Close has made it an important mission to guide Betts through that, and reminding her not only of her talent, but of her value both as a person and a player.\n\n\"I know who Sienna Betts is and I know how good she's going to be,\" head coach Cori Close said at halftime. \"I just want her to give herself some grace right now. She's trying to do everything all at once. She has done a heck of a job in how she's returned to play, what's she's been learning... how she will continue to improve even though it's not the way she wanted too or planned.\"\n\nNow that her first game is behind her, one of two things can happen for Betts. Either the pressure is off her shoulders and she can simply focus on moving forward, or the liklier option, she'll ramp up the intensity as much as she can now that she's got a taste of college ball.\n\n\"Sometimes an overused strength becomes a weakness. And her strength is  she demands a very high level of herself all the time. But, when you over use that or it gets out of balance it can also hold you back. So, I'm encouraging her to think about process, encouraging her to write down all of the things she did well... She made so many maturation steps over this last six or seven weeks. It's hard. If it was easy everyone would do it.\"",

    "fullText": "Braves leveraged Scott Boras' blueprint with Pete Alonso, Alex Bregman to re-sign Ha-Seong Kim originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves made the decision to claim shortstop Ha-Seong Kim off waivers during the final month of the regular season. In recent years, the shortstop position had become a weak spot for the team. Kim, however, took full advantage of his opportunity, quickly turning himself into an attractive name on the free-agent market. Kim also admitted that he enjoyed his time playing in Atlanta.\n\n“It was great. I enjoyed it in Tampa Bay, but I think I had more fun and enjoyed playing baseball in Atlanta. I'm sorry I kept feeling unwell and in pain in Tampa Bay,” Kim said.\n\nOn Monday, Kim signed back with the Braves on a one-year deal.\n\n“Shortstop Ha-Seong Kim is returning to the Atlanta Braves, agreeing Monday to a one-year, $20 million contract that addressed a major offseason priority for the team. Kim gets a $4 million raise. He had declined a $16 million player option that was in the two-year, $29 million contract he signed in February with Tampa Bay, a deal that paid him $13 million. The Braves announced the new deal with Kim on Monday night,” ESPN reported.\n\nWhile other teams reportedly offered Kim longer contracts, his agent Scott Boras focused on maximizing short-term value — and Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos executed his strategy perfectly.\n\n“Given that teams have largely avoided the lengthy nine figure deals aside from the absolute best free agents in recent years, Boras has pivoted somewhat to having his clients start taking short-term deals over and over again to get the total amount of money they wanted from the beginning. Pete Alonso had to do it with the Mets last offseason as did Alex Bregman. That Boras has both men as clients was not an accident,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote. “In this case, the Braves knew what they wanted and they knew how they could get it from the Boras client and the team is now in much better position for it.”\n\nThe Braves have done nearly everything right this winter. After missing the playoffs last season, Atlanta has positioned itself as a legitimate threat to the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL East.\n\nAnthopoulos isn’t just playing his cards correctly with players — he’s also navigating one of the most difficult agents in baseball in Scott Boras. If the Kim experiment goes well during the first half of the season, an extension could very well be in play.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City welcome Brentford to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night in an all-Premier League EFL Cup quarter-final showdown.\n\nMan City booked their place in the last eight with a comfortable 3-1 win over Swansea City.\n\nWhile Premier League and Champions League success usually take centre stage at the Etihad, the EFL Cup still carries significance for Pep Guardiola’s side, given their rich history in the tournament.\n\nMan City have dominated the competition, lifting the trophy six times in eight seasons between 2014 and 2021.\n\nHowever, they have not won it since edging Tottenham Hotspur in the 2021 final and have failed to reach the quarter-finals in recent years.\n\nThat makes tonight’s contest an important marker, especially as Man City have gone on to win the trophy after each of their last six quarter-final victories.\n\nGuardiola has rotated his squad well so far, guiding Man City past Huddersfield Town and Swansea with little fuss. The hosts also head into the game on the back of five wins in a row across all competitions.\n\nMan City clinically dispatched a profligate Crystal Palace side 3-0 in the Premier League and will be confident of extending their winning streak at the expense of another London club.\n\nGuardiola is expected to name a heavily rotated side for tonight’s EFL Cup showdown, with next weekend’s home game against West Ham United in mind.\n\nJames Trafford will likely return to the XI for the first time since the 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League.\n\nThere should be changes to the backline, although Nico O’Reilly will likely reprise his role.\n\nWith John Stones struggling with injury, Nathan Ake returns to the XI for the first time in over a month.\n\nAbdulkodir Khusanov should join the out-of-favour centre-back at the heart of defence, while Rico Lewis lines up at right back.\n\nTijjani Reijnders should start at the base of midfield with Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Oscar Bobb, and Bernardo Silva ahead of him.\n\nWith Omar Marmoush jetting off to the Africa Cup of Nations, Erling Braut Haaland should lead the line.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City welcome Brentford to the Etihad Stadium with a place in the Carabao Cup semi-final on the line. For Man City, this competition carries added edge after a trophyless 2024-25 campaign, a rare blank year by their recent standards. For Brentford, it represents another chance to test themselves against elite opposition, having already shown their appetite for cup football this season.\n\nBoth sides arrive with reasons for optimism, but also with clear obstacles to overcome as the margins tighten at the quarter-final stage.\n\nMan City are eight-time winners of the Carabao Cup, yet have not reached the final four since lifting the trophy in 2020-21. That gap feels longer than it is, largely because of the club’s relentless domestic dominance elsewhere. Pep Guardiola has already rotated heavily in earlier rounds, navigating past Huddersfield and Swansea without fuss.\n\nThis match fits a familiar pattern for Man City, a demanding league schedule balanced against a cup competition that often doubles as a testing ground for squad depth. Guardiola has confirmed rotation again, which opens doors for players such as John Stones, while others are likely to be protected with bigger targets in mind. Even so, the underlying expectation remains unchanged, control the game, limit chaos, and let quality decide.\n\nBrentford’s route to this stage has been anything but gentle. They edged past Bournemouth, survived a penalty shootout against Aston Villa, and then swept aside Grimsby 5-0, a side who had earlier stunned Manchester United. That run highlights Brentford’s ability to raise their level in knockout football, particularly away from home.\n\nHowever, history offers limited comfort. Brentford have lost their last two Carabao Cup quarter-finals and have only once reached the semi-final of this competition. Trips to the Etihad rarely forgive defensive lapses, and their Premier League away form remains a concern despite two Carabao Cup wins on the road this season.\n\nMan City remain without Jeremy Doku, who is sidelined by a leg injury, while Rodri is not expected back in time after his hamstring issue. Mateo Kovacic continues his recovery, and Africa Cup of Nations duty rules out Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri. Erling Haaland has not featured in the competition so far and could again be rested.\n\nBrentford are also affected by AFCON, with Dango Ouattara and Frank Onyeka unavailable. Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo and Josh Dasilva remain long-term absentees, while Reiss Nelson is a doubt. There is better news in attack, with Kevin Schade poised to return after suspension.\n\nBrentford have a habit of making Man City uncomfortable, often pressing with bravery and directness. Yet the Etihad presents a different challenge altogether, especially against a Guardiola side determined to avoid another cup exit.\n\nPrediction: Man City to win 2-1.",

EU officials say changing the limit will not affect progress toward making the 27-country bloc's economy climate neutral by 2050. That means producing only as much carbon dioxide as can be absorbed by forests and oceans or by abatement methods such as storing it underground. CO2 is the primary greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for climate change.",

    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

    "title": "When Red in the US Is Green in India – The AQI Disparity Problem",
    "description": "AirGradient air quality monitoring.",
    "fullText": "If you look at an air quality map of India, you’ll find that the map looks completely different depending on whether you’re in India or the US. This stems from the major disparities that exist between national air quality indices (AQIs), which use different categorization labels, benchmarks, and colours to denote air quality.\n\nIndia’s National Air Quality Index (NAQI), as seen above on the left, reveals mostly green and yellow clusters, representing “satisfactory” and “moderate” air. For the same exact clusters measured in the same period, using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) AQI, seen on the right, will show mostly orange and red. These represent “unhealthy for sensitive groups” or generally “unhealthy” air, signalling a significantly higher level of concern.\n\nHere we can see the difference between the categories of these two AQIs – India’s NAQI on the left, and the US AQI on the right. NAQI’s “good” and “satisfactory” standards cover two separate categories, seen here on the AirGradient map legend in two shades of green. For those without a careful eye for detail, this can make a “satisfactory” cluster be mistaken for a “good” one.\n\nThis further highlights the difficulty of comparing cross-country indices; greens, oranges, and reds don’t automatically correspond, and can even be split within one index.\n\nIn its 2021 air quality guidelines, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that a 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration above 15 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) is already beyond its recommended limit. India’s system, in contrast, sets the comparable 24-hour threshold of PM2.5 at 60 µg/m3, which is four times higher.\n\nHowever, India is far from being alone in exceeding this limit. China sets its limit at 75 µg/m3, the European Union at 50 µg/m3, the US at 35 µg/m3, and Canada at 28 µg/m3, just to name a few.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the implications are striking: two people breathing air with the same level of PM2.5 in two different countries could be told very different stories about how safe that air is. This gap silently shapes how millions of people understand the air they breathe, and can influence the activities they undertake in their day-to-day lives. For example, recommendations related to prolonged and strenuous outdoor activities are particularly important, seeing as exercise poses additional health risks due to the increased uptake and deposit of pollutants in the lungs.\n\nAfter all, WHO guidelines remain advisory, and hence, governments have no legal obligation to abide by them. However, they are formulated by expert committees with the aim of informing local policymaking.\n\nFirstly, there’s a technological disparity to note, as countries use different types of reference grade monitors as the ‘official’ norm, which measure air pollution differences. India’s official monitors use beta attenuation monitors (BAMs), which physically weigh particles and require regular maintenance and biyearly calibration, whereas many private platforms use low-maintenance sensor-based devices that rely on laser scattering. BAMs are more accurate and better suited for measuring higher concentrations, which fits with India’s local context. However, without the regular maintenance required, this advantage may be negated, and the accuracy of the data reported may in fact suffer.\n\nAccording to Gufran Beig, founder director of India’s national air quality monitoring system SAFAR, “every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment”. India’s Northern Plain, for example, experiences natural dust storms. These increase both coarse and fine particulate matter concentrations in the ambient air, which cause conditions to exceed the WHO limit. Adopting this standard in these locations would classify air as polluted even without human activity.\n\nThe Indian Environment Ministry raises another point regarding the need to account for “socio-economic status and national circumstances”. While the country is striving to transition towards cleaner alternatives in accordance with the National Action Plan on Climate Change, most of the energy consumed in India is derived from fossil fuels, particularly coal. Meanwhile, the combustion of coal, petrol, diesel, gas, biomass, and waste accounts for 81% of PM2.5 pollution. Therefore, reducing air pollution would logically entail targeting this sector. If India were to strictly adhere to international standards, it would require an overhaul of its energy production systems, transportation, and construction, and would incur significant job losses in the fossil fuel sector. This would impact economic growth and development goals, yielding social and political challenges.\n\nShould there be a standardized international index, or should we allow for cross-country variation?\n\nOn one hand, a stricter index aligned with WHO limits might better reflect health risks and allow for comparable scales, but would expose the severity of a problem that is expensive and politically costly to fix. On the other, a looser index can account for local contexts, and reduce public alarm and short-term political pressure. However, this may come at the cost of long-term passivity.\n\nAt AirGradient, we are grappling with this question ourselves. On our mobile app, which features a map that visualizes real-time air quality data, users can select to display values either as raw concentration values (µg/m³) or using the U.S. EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) scale.\n\nShould we also integrate other national indices such as India’s NAQI? This would allow us to reach a larger audience and adapt to what users are familiar with, but would also mean shaping norms towards an acceptance of indices that may be misinforming their users of the real health risks.\n\nYou can download the AirGradient map and test out the index displays here: App Store / Play Store\n\nCentral Pollution Control Board.

    "fullText": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by civilians as a conceivable alternative, or partial alternative, to the traditional, purely military concepts of national defense that have so long prevailed and continue to prevail in European countries. He has restricted the range of applicability of his researches and reflections to Europe, and has directed them, within those limits, primarily to the neutral countries such as Austria and Finland. But his study is intended to apply, at least hypothetically, to such other countries, now members of one or the other of the great nuclear alliances, as might in some distant future succeed in detaching themselves from the alliance in question and thus find themselves compelled to devise an independent defense policy that makes sense with regard to the military and political realities of the present day. The question addressed in this book is essentially this: Where is the peace-loving, nonaggressive, and nonaligned country to find the maximum security against outside interference and domination in a world where war itself, and therefore the traditional preparations for war, have lost so much of their rationale as instruments of national policy?\n\nThe answer in the NATO establishment (and perhaps also, although with diminished conviction and enthusiasm, in the Soviet one, too) would be: in the nuclear deterrent, of course. Either, one would say, you have your own nuclear arsenal, or you ally yourself with someone else who has one.\n\nMr. Sharp challenges (quite correctly in the opinion of this reviewer) the validity of this supposed alternative. Not only is the nuclear deterrent by its very nature dangerously unstable but it is not really a means of defense. In the concept of nuclear deterrence, Mr. Sharp notes, “the capacity to defend in order to deter has been replaced by the capability to destroy massively without the ability to defend.” Beyond this there is, for any country wishing to go the nuclear road, the necessity of choosing between the development of a nuclear arsenal of one’s own, at vast expense and in defiance of the international effort to restrict proliferation, and the acceptance of an alliance with some existing nuclear power—a relationship bound, as experience has shown, to raise the unanswerable question about whose interests, those of the protector or those of the nominally protected, are eventually to prevail in a moment of crisis so brief as to be responsive only to the impulses of the computer.\n\nFinally, as Mr. Sharp also points out, to create a nuclear arsenal or to accept someone else’s missiles on one’s own territory is to increase immensely, from a point of near zero to a very high level, the danger that in any sort of a nuclear conflict one’s own country will become a likely target. Mr. Sharp could even have strengthened his case, in this respect, by pointing out that the Soviet leaders have repeatedly and specifically affirmed that they would never use nuclear weapons against any country that did not itself deploy them or permit them to be deployed on its own territory—an assurance that deserves greater credence than it has generally received, not only because there would be no reason to put out such a statement exclusively to deceive, but also because, given the general irrationality of the nuclear weapon, that policy in question makes perfectly good sense.\n\nThus for a nonnuclear country determined to pursue an independent policy but required to live under the shadow of the nuclear competition of the two super-powers, the nuclear option is not a hopeful one. But neither, for that matter, is an exclusive reliance on the traditional concepts of defense with “conventional” weapons. In an age of long-range striking power by aircraft, by missiles, even by long-range artillery, the idea of defense at the frontier has lost its reality. Beyond that, such is now the destructive power of even nonnuclear weapons that a war fought with them, particularly a defensive war presumably conducted largely on one’s own territory, promises nothing but a degree of devastation that makes a mockery of the very idea of military victory. Here we simply get back to the fact that war, generally, as among the industrially advanced and technologically sophisticated countries, can no longer serve any useful purpose—not even that of a defense.\n\nIt did not, actually, take the post–World War II advances in weapons technology to establish this fact. It is inescapably clear that in the two great European wars of this century there were, in reality, no victors. These were, in effect, simply senseless orgies of destruction. The damages they inflicted, on the nominal victor and the defeated alike, were far greater and more insidious than people were even aware of at the time, reaching as they did into the spiritual and genetic as well as the purely military and physical realms. It is idle for the independent European country of this day to suppose that by entering into a new and even more horrible round of such carnage it could protect anything worth protecting.\n\nThese two supposed alternatives for an independent defense on the part of the unaligned Continental country are therefore, when looked at carefully, no alternatives at all. It is not surprising, in these circumstances, that people’s minds should turn to the question whether there might not be some means of defense that would at least hold out hope of avoiding the sheer physical disasters that both of these supposed alternatives invite. It is this necessity that has led to Professor Sharp’s inquiry into the possibilities and limitations of civilian-based defense; and it would be unfair to judge it in any way other than in relation to the unpromising nature of these two, and only, visible alternatives. It is worth bearing in mind, as one reads his book, that however one assesses the possibilities of civilian-based defense, the nature of the available alternatives is such that it would not take much to be preferable to them.\n\nMr. Sharp’s study addresses itself, as its subtitle (The Potential of Civilian-based Deterrence and Defence) implies, both to deterrence and to resistance if deterrence fails. The two are of course closely connected; but each requires separate treatment, and receives it.\n\nDeterrence, in this instance, is of particular importance. For the study starts, as so much conventional military thinking fails to do, from the assumption that the presumptive attacker is motivated not just by a blind urge to destroy for destruction’s sake but rather by a wholly rational desire to gain domination over the political life of the victim country and to use that domination to his own advantage. And here, of course, is where the reactions of the civilian population—its will to resist and the preparation it has been given for doing so—come in. To deny this is to fly in the face of the historical evidence. For if we consider the failure of other powers to attack Switzerland during the two world wars, the failure of the Soviet Union to occupy Finland in the wake of their conflicts during World War II, and the similar abstention by Moscow from attacking Yugoslavia after that country’s break with the Soviet Union in 1948, we can see that calculations relating to the respective country’s presumptive powers of internal resistance, while certainly not the only considerations that played a part, occupied a prominent place among those that determined the final decision.\n\nThe successful imposition of foreign domination over a given country requires the ability of the dominating power to find, from among the population of that country, a faction either so inspired ideologically or so successfully cowed as to serve as a puppet government. It then requires that this faction should have the capacity to recruit the requisite indigenous bureaucracy, and to compel the population to accept and respect its authority. But whether these conditions can or cannot be met is something that will be importantly affected by the extent and effectiveness of the training, indoctrination, and general preparation for resistance that the population has received in advance of the event. This, in turn, is something the potential aggressor is likely to have a fair idea of before he takes the decision whether or not to attack; and his decision is bound to be affected by his assessment of its importance.\n\nAs for resistance itself if deterrence fails, there are a great many possible forms of this (Mr. Sharp has himself identified nearly two hundred of them). Some of these may be overt and largely spontaneous; others require the most highly centralized leadership, training, and direction. Some are designed to have military effect; others are directed solely to civilian administration. Some require mass participation; others can be conducted only conspiratorially, by carefully selected and highly trained individuals. The mix to be chosen in any given instance must depend on the nature of the country in question and the peculiarities of the prevailing situation. To select among these, and to conduct careful advance planning and preparation for their implementation, is a function that lies at the heart of civilian-based defense as Mr. Sharp sees it; and it is precisely in this respect that his reflections are most importantly innovative.\n\nFor seldom, if ever, in the contests of the past, has there been any such thing as this careful advance preparation. The resistance movements that made themselves felt during the Second World War were almost without exception ones that had to be improvised under conditions of extreme danger and difficulty—under the eyes and guns, that is, of the occupier. There can be no doubt that had they had the sort of advance preparation this study envisages, their effectiveness would have been increased several times over. Lines of command would have been known; effective channels of communication would have existed; there would have been adequate caches of weapons and supplies; ordinary citizens would have had guidance and instruction as to how to behave; given types of action would have been rehearsed and prepared.\n\nSkeptics may point to the long endurance of the Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe as evidence of the hopelessness of civilian resistance to domination by a strong outside power. But again, what they will be citing as an example is not at all what Mr. Sharp has in mind. There was, in those instances, no possibility whatsoever for advance preparation—quite the contrary. What the Soviet authorities found before them, as their armies overran this great region, was a territory where all semblance of real indigenous authority had already been swept away by the preceding Nazi-German occupation. It is often forgotten that it was not the Russians but the Nazis who destroyed the prewar status quo in that part of the world, and with it all social and political stability. What the Russians found there was in fact a territory ideally prepared to receive just the sort of domination they were desirous of establishing—a situation, in short, just the opposite of the one Mr. Sharp has in mind when he examines the possibilities of a resistance well prepared in advance by an indigenous government enjoying the confidence of the people. For this concept, there are, in fact, few examples. It is a modern concept, addressed to the unprecedented conditions of this modern age.\n\nI am not in total agreement with all of Mr. Sharp’s argument. There are places where the emphasis, in my view, could have been usefully shifted. I would have placed more weight on highly centralized, clandestine direction, less on spontaneous mass action. I am not sure that the nature of civilian defense planning should be so widely publicized as the author of the book would seem to envisage. I am less sanguine than he is about the possibilities for demoralizing the armed forces of an intruder. But these are minor differences, particularly if we take into account the limitations Mr. Sharp has placed on his own conclusions.\n\nThere is, of course, in this endangered world, no such thing as absolute defense for anyone; and Mr. Sharp advances no claim that a civilian-based system would provide this. He does not even claim that civilian-based defense could usefully constitute the only component of an adequate defense policy. He recognizes that it might have to be combined, at one stage or another, with the actions of certain types of regular military forces. He does not even depict his own conclusions as definitive. His plea is only that civilian-based defense has a legitimate place among the options open to the sort of country he is talking about; that this place is plainly larger than has been generally supposed; and that its possibilities ought to be more carefully studied and considered than they have been in the past. His primary purpose in writing the book was, he says, “to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.” And for this, he makes a reasonably good case.\n\nBut he must not expect, just for this reason, that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going. It goes against the grain of all established strategic thinking. The professional military establishments will brush it off with incredulity, if not with contempt. It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.\n\nBut the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it. It might just be that in a world where the devices of long-range military destruction have proliferated beyond all reason, the greatest security any country can hope to have, imperfect as it is, will be found to lie primarily in its confidence in itself, in its readiness to leave other people alone and to go its own way, it its willingness to accept the sort of social discipline that a civilian-based defense implies—in a stance, in other words, that offers minimal incentive to foreign military intrusion but promises to make things difficult, painful, and unprofitable for any power that decides, nevertheless, to intrude. Such principles may not be everywhere applicable. Nowhere may they be the complete answer to the problems at hand. But beggars, in this world of destructive power unlimited, cannot always be choosers. And Mr. Sharp’s approach, certainly more humane and in a small way more hopeful than many others, deserves at least to be given a hearing.\n\nTo see things in this way will require, however, a rather basic change in the view hundreds of millions of people have been taught to take of the sources of national security and of the means by which it may be usefully promoted. The new view would be one that looks primarily inward—to the quality of the respective society, to the character of its institutions, to its social discipline and civic morale, rather than outward to the effectiveness of its armed forces—for the true sources of its strength and its security. It suggests, in Mr. Sharp’s words, “the direct defense of society as such—its principles, free institutions, and liberties—rather than a futile attempt to defend territory as an indirect means to defend the society.” It raises, in fact, the question whether any society can be stronger in relation to others than it is to itself.\n\nWhat is implied here is no less than a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, “a crucial insight into the nature of power”—namely, that\n\nall political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight…against internal and foreign aggressors, and to triumph…. With effort, risks, and costs, it is possible for Europeans—and all peoples—to make themselves politically indigestible to would-be tyrants. The process has already begun.\n\nPerhaps those words overstate the case; but if so, not greatly. One ends the reading of the book wondering whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so.\n\nGeorge F. Kennan (1904–2005) was an American diplomat, political scientist and historian. He is best known for his role in shaping US foreign policy during the Cold War and, in particular, for the doctrine of containment. Kennan was Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and served as Ambassador to the USSR in 1952 and as Ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1961 to 1963. His books include At a Century’s Ending and An American Family.",

    "fullText": "Demis Hassabis has a blunt message for parts of the AI startup world: Some of this looks unsustainable.\n\nThe DeepMind cofounder and CEO said in an episode of \"Google DeepMind: The Podcast\" published Tuesday that there are likely \"bubbles\" forming in today's AI funding frenzy, particularly among early-stage startups raising money at huge valuations.\n\nSome startups \"basically haven't even got going yet,\" he said, yet are raising at \"tens of billions of dollars valuations just out of the gate.\"\n\n\"It's sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. You know, my guess is probably not, at least not in general,\" he added.\n\nHassabis drew a distinction between those sky-high seed rounds and the large tech companies pouring billions into AI infrastructure. There's \"a lot of real business\" underpinning Big Tech's valuations, he said.\n\nAI is \"overhyped in the short term\" but \"still underappreciated in the medium to long-term,\" he added.\n\nHassabis said an \"over-correction\" is imminent for any major technology shift like AI, especially when it goes from skepticism to obsession quickly.\n\n\"When we started DeepMind, no one believed in it,\" he said. \"Fast forward 10, 15 years, and now, obviously, it seems to be the only thing people talk about in business.\"\n\nThat kind of swing often pushes valuations too far and too fast. \"It's almost an overreaction to the underreaction,\" he said.\n\nHassabis also said he isn't worried about whether AI is in a bubble — he's focused on his job. Google DeepMind builds the AI models that power Google's products, including Gemini, and leads the company's frontier AI research.\n\nHassabis' comments come as AI startups continue to rake in soaring valuations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last week that young founders — some of whom are fresh out of school — are raising millions for their AI startups. Many have dropped out to ride the AI wave, pulling in top investors and talent.\n\nA Stanford graduate dropout raised $64 million for her AI math startup earlier this year. Carina Hong, the founder of Axiom Math, even recruited top AI talent from Meta and Google Brain.\n\nThe 16 young founders Business Insider spoke with this year have secured over $100 million in funding.\n\nBut not everyone is buying the hype. Howard Marks, the cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, said on an episode of \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast published last week that investors are flocking to AI startups with little track record.\n\n\"Do you want to have a novel entrepreneurial startup pure play which has no revenues and no profits today, but could be a moonshot if it works?\" the billionaire asked.\n\n\"Or do you want to invest in a great tech company, which is already existing and making a lot of money where AI could be incremental but not life-changing? It's a choice.\"",

No boxer in their right mind would have said no. Anyone who says they would are completely lying through their teeth.\n\nWe took a fight that we believe will be very straightforward, will give AJ a huge profile in America and one of his career-high paydays.\n\nAJ was going to have a run-out fight in November in Saudi - an eight-rounder against a guy who was ranked about 100th in the heavyweight division.\n\nIt was an opportunity to wrap the hands with his new training team, do the ringwalk and go through the motions. Now we're doing that same run-out but for 50 times more money.\n\nWe have a clear strategy in mind - to knock Jake out asap. Then we go into normal service being resumed in 2026.\n\nAJ will fight against a world-class opponent in February and - if all goes well - he will then fight Tyson Fury.\n\nSo there's a method to this madness and taking this fight does not affect AJ's legacy. But losing to Jake or it even going the distance would.\n\nIt would be an absolute disaster and awfully embarrassing.",

    "description": "Two more members of The Heritage Foundation's Board of Trustees, Shane McCullar and Abby Spencer Moffat, resigned on Tuesday.",
    "fullText": "Two more members of The Heritage Foundation’s Board of Trustees, Shane McCullar and Abby Spencer Moffat, resigned on Tuesday, citing concerns over Heritage’s direction and approach to combating anti-Semitism.\n\nA statement from McCullar obtained by Mediaite reads:\n\nWhen Ed Feulner encouraged me to join the Board of The Heritage Foundation, I did so to help advance the ideals of America’s Founding. My intention was to work from within to further the conservative principles in alignment with our great nation.\n\nToday, I have resigned from the Board of Trustees of the Heritage Foundation in furtherance of those same values.\n\nNo institution that hesitates to condemn antisemitism and hatred—or that gives a platform to those who spread them—can credibly claim to uphold the vision that once made the Heritage Foundation the world’s most respected conservative think tank. And, I cannot, in good conscience, remain on a board that is unwilling to confront the lapses in judgment that have harmed its credibility, its culture, and the conservative movement it once helped shape.\n\nI leave with respect for the Heritage Foundation’s past, but I cannot support the course it has chosen for its future. My commitment to the principles that brought me here remains unchanged, which is why I must now step away.\n\nAfter careful reflection, I have resigned from the Board of Trustees of The Heritage Foundation. This was not an easy decision, given my family’s long and meaningful relationship with the institution, but it was a necessary one.\n\nHeritage’s handling of recent challenges reveals a drift from the principles that once defined its leadership. When an institution hesitates to confront harmful ideas and allows lapses in judgment to stand, it forfeits the moral authority on which its influence depends.\n\nI remain committed to the ideals of the American Founding and to institutions that champion human dignity and responsible governance. But I cannot remain on a board unwilling or unable to meet this moment with the clarity and courage it requires.\n\nI step away in the hope that Heritage will regain the steadiness, discernment, and sense of purpose that once anchored its essential role in American civic life.\n\nAfter Tucker Carlson conducted a friendly interview with white nationalist leader Nick Fuentes earlier this fall, the think tank’s president, Kevin Roberts, released a fiery video defending Carlson and excoriating what he described as the “venomous coalition” criticizing him. Roberts’s handling of the situation was the subject of much scorn, including on the right, and he eventually recanted.\n\nMcCullar and Moffat’s resignations were preceded by Princeton professor and conservative elder Robert George’s departure from the Board. In a November Facebook post, George wrote:\n\nI have resigned from the board of the Heritage Foundation. I could not remain without a full retraction of the video released by Kevin Roberts, speaking for and in the name of Heritage, on October 30th. Although Kevin publicly apologized for some of what he said in the video, he could not offer a full retraction of its content. So, we reached an impasse.\n\nKevin is a good man. He made what he acknowledged was a serious mistake. Being human myself, I have plenty of experience in making mistakes. What divided us was a difference of opinion about what was required to rectify the mistake.\n\nI’m sad to be leaving the Heritage board. I have great affection and esteem for Barb Gaby, who chairs the board, and my other board colleagues. I wish them and the Heritage Foundation the very best.\n\nMy hope for Heritage is that it will be unbending and unflinching in its fidelity to its founding vision, upholding the moral principles of the Judeo-Christian tradition and the civic principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. I pray that Heritage’s research and advocacy will be guided by the conviction that each and every member of the human family, irrespective of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything else, as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, is “created equal” and “endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.”\n\nThe anchor for the Heritage Foundation, and for our Nation, and for every patriotic American is that creed. It must always be that creed. If we hold fast to it even when expediency counsels compromising it, we cannot go wrong. If we abandon it, we sign the death certificate of republican government and ordered liberty.\n\nHeritage Foundation Chief Advancement Officer Andy Olivastro told Mediaite, “We’re grateful to Abby and Shane for their service to Heritage. Going forward, we will advance bold initiatives grounded in permanent things and anchored by our Four Cornerstones: the American Family, the Dignity of Work and Future of Free Enterprise, National Security, and American Heritage and Citizenship.”\n\n“We have a responsibility to deliver for the American people, by developing serious ideas, sound policy, and practical solutions that ensure the conservative movement remains a governing majority for generations to come,” added Olivastro. “Our mission is clear: We exist to save the republic and secure it for future generations.”\n\nThe post BREAKING: Two More Heritage Foundation Board Members Resign Amid Tucker-Fuentes Fallout first appeared on Mediaite.",

He and his wife have lived in their home near Dallas for 35 years and paid it off. In that time, it has increased in value by $300,000.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThey’d like to sell their home and use the proceeds to buy a smaller condo, investing what’s left to continue funding their retirement, and hold off collecting Social Security for another couple of years.\n\nHowever, Shane is wondering about just how big the tax bill will be on $300,000 in capital gains accrued over 35 years.\n\nThe good news is that long-term capital gains come with a special tax advantage over short-term capital gains, and can play a positive role in retirement finances.\n\nIt's important to balance your various income streams and cash out your gains strategically.\n\nLong-term capital gains are earnings on investments or real estate held for at least a year and a day.\n\nAny earnings on investments held for a shorter time are classified as short-term capital gains.\n\nThere's a major difference between them when it comes to taxes. Long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates than short-term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income.\n\nYou can leverage the tax-advantageous aspect of long-term capital gains when it comes to drawing on your nest egg for income.\n\nThe amount of tax you pay on long-term capital gains depends on your tax-filing status and your overall income.\n\nHere’s a rundown of long-term capital gains tax rates as of 2025 at the federal level — not including state and local capital gains taxes (1).\n\nIf you’re single, your long-term capital gains tax rate will be:\n\n0% if your income is $48,350 or less\n\n15% if your income is between $48,351 and $533,400\n\n**20% **if your income is more than $533,400.",

    "fullText": "Global macro analyst Luke Gromen, long known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against fiat debasement, has adopted a more cautious outlook for the near term.\n\nSpeaking during a recent podcast appearance, Gromen warned that the asset could fall toward the $40,000 range.\n\nDuring the podcast, Gromen stressed that his broader investment thesis has not changed.\n\nHe continues to believe that long-term currency debasement will push investors toward scarce assets such as gold and Bitcoin.\n\nDollar debasement is the decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power due to expanding money supply, inflation, or excessive government debt. This prompts investors to seek scarce assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or gold as protection.\n\nHowever, he now argues that gold and select equities may offer a cleaner expression of that trade than Bitcoin in the coming years.\n\n“Basically everything but gold and the dollar are likely to get waylaid,” Gromen said.\n\nGromen pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to make new highs relative to gold as a key warning sign. The absence of that breakout, he argued, suggests Bitcoin’s risk-reward profile has deteriorated.\n\nTreasury Secretary Bessent to propose major changes that could reshape crypto regulation\n\nAnalyst warns Fed’s $40B monthly Treasury buys could reprice crypto\n\nTeachers union warns new bill could put retirement savings at risk\n\nHe also highlighted a break below key long-term technical levels.\n\nAccording to Gromen, similar technical breakdowns in the recent past were followed by drawdowns, raising concerns that Bitcoin could face a deeper correction if history repeats.\n\n“When these technicals broke, each of the last three times, the median decline in Bitcoin was 65%–70% each time,” he said.\n\n\"The size it had grown in my portfolio, to me it just spoke to me a need to right-size it and substantially reduce positions. Because I think it's going a lot lower.\"\n\nAnother factor weighing on sentiment, according to Gromen, is the growing discussion around quantum computing risks. While most crypto traders consider it as a distant threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography, the topic has gained traction among investors.\n\nGromen suggested that large holders who have accumulated Bitcoin over the past decade may be increasingly inclined to hedge or trim exposure as the narrative gains visibility.\n\n“If I thought quantum was a risk I wanted to at least hedge somewhat, I would start to take some off the table,” he said, pointing to what he perceives as whale selling alongside weak price action.",

    "description": "This isn't the first time in 2025 that California has turned to drastic measures.",
    "fullText": "To prevent the spread of a serious bacterial disease that infects citrus crops, United States officials are expanding two federal quarantine areas.\n\nAs reported by the Fresh Fruit Portal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has expanded the citrus greening quarantines for two separate counties in Southern California.\n\nAPHIS is expanding the quarantined area in the Capistrano Beach area of Orange County by 29 square miles and the Murrieta area of Riverside County by 129 square miles. The announcement of the expansion follows the positive detection of citrus greening in plant tissue samples collected from locations in both Orange and Riverside Counties.\n\nAccording to APHIS, there are currently no commercial citrus trees impacted by the expansion of the quarantined area in Orange County. However, 170 acres of commercial citrus trees have now been impacted by the citrus greening quarantine in Riverside County.\n\nThe quarantine expansions are coordinated with the California Department of Food and Agriculture. They aim to contain citrus greening by restricting the movement of citrus materials within the state, aligning with 7 CFR 301.76.\n\n\"This action is necessary to prevent the spread of citrus greening to non-infested areas of the United States,\" APHIS wrote in the release.\n\nThe bacterial disease is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, an invasive insect species that was first documented in the U.S. in 1998. These invasive pests can wreak havoc on local ecosystems and economies by disrupting agricultural industries and interfering with native species.\n\nCitrus greening, in particular, can be devastating for citrus crops. It can lead to reduced yields, poor-quality fruit, and higher production costs. The bacteria can block nutrient flow in plants, stunting growth and killing roots. As noted by APHIS, there is currently no known cure for the disease.\n\nThis isn't the first time in 2025 that California has turned to drastic measures to deal with invasive insects. In September, portions of Santa Clara County were placed under quarantine by the California Department of Food and Agriculture after officials detected the invasive Mediterranean fruit fly.\n\n\"A quarantine is a way to minimize damage and stop the risk of spread by restricting the movement of fruits and vegetables,\" wrote the CDFA in a press release.\n\nDo you think fracking should be illegal in America?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "The National Weather Service in Boulder says it is increasingly confident in a high-impact wind event for Northern Colorado and the mountains on Dec. 17.\n\nDownslope winds will create critical fire danger and are increasingly likely to cause Xcel Energy to shut off electricity in the area.\n\nAs a result, several schools will be closed Dec. 17.\n\nHigh-wind warnings, watches and red flag warnings are in place across much of the state.\n\nThe National Weather Service says to expect damaging winds to blow down trees and power lines, widespread power outages and difficult travel, especially for high profile vehicles.\n\nAnd any new fire that broke out under these conditions would likely led to rapid fire growth, the warning says.\n\nThe NWS advises people to avoid outdoor burning or activities that cause sparks and to secure loose objects.\n\nThe Fort Collins area is under a high-wind warning from 11 a.m. to midnight on Dec. 17, with a red flag warning from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nWest winds of 30 to 50 mph are expected, with gusts up to 80 mph in the areas of Fort Collins, Boulder and the western suburbs of Denver.\n\nThe strongest gusts will peak in the 70-85 mph range, with gusts 50-70 mph being relatively widespread, according to the forecast.\n\nIn the mountains and foothills above 9,000 feet, the weather service has high confidence of wind gusts of 75 to 85 mph.\n\nIn the foothills and lower elevations west of Interstate 25, there is medium confidence in gusts over 75 mph.\n\nAcross the plains in the evening, there is medium to low confidence in gusts up to 60 mph.\n\nThe worst of the wind is expected in the afternoon.\n\nFor Dec. 18, weaker winds are expected with the chance for stronger downslope winds on Dec. 19, according to the NWS.\n\nXcel Energy says it is likely it will proactively shut off electricity starting at 10 a.m. Dec. 17 due to strong winds increasing the risk of damage to power lines and outages.\n\nThis would affect 50,000 customers in Boulder, Clear Creek, Jefferson, Larimer and Weld counties, which is fewer than originally expected.\n\nHowever, unplanned outages could also occur due to high winds, Xcel's website notes.\n\nIn Larimer County, Xcel's service area is a patchwork, but includes some portions of all of its communities, like Fort Collins, Loveland, Windsor, Timnath, Laporte, Wellington and Berthoud.\n\nIt could take several hours or days to restore power, Xcel said, because crews must examine and/or repair lines before they can be reenergized.\n\nXcel said it will make a decision about the shutoff no later than the morning of Dec. 17.\n\nCustomers can check the status of power on Xcel's electric outage map.\n\nXcel serves many schools in the area, and districts have announced closures or alternate schedules.\n\nIn Poudre School District, the following schools will be closed: Bethke Elementary, Timnath Elementary, Timnath Middle-High School, Red Feather Lakes Elementary, Stove Prairie Elementary and Livermore Elementary. All athletics and activities at those schools will also be canceled.\n\nAll other PSD schools remain open.\n\nIn Weld RE-4, which is the district covering Windsor and Severance schools, elementary schools will be closed and middle and high schools will operate on an alternate schedule:\n\nSchool will be canceled for students in preschool through fifth grade, and there will be no AlphaBEST programming.\n\nMiddle schools will release at 11:25 a.m. and high schools will release at 12:10 p.m. Lunch will be provided on a grab-and-go basis. There will be no afterschool practices, activities and events.\n\nColorado State University campuses are not expected to be affected by the Xcel shutoff, according to a social media post from CSU Police & Safety.\n\nOther electric providers in Larimer County are not planning proactive outages. However, one of them said outages due to wind damage are still possible.\n\nThe municipal utilities serving Fort Collins and Loveland, whose power lines are buried, say they don't expect any outages. They both get their wholesale power from Platte River Power Authority.\n\nPRPA is closely monitoring the weather event but doesn't plan a preemptive shutdown, communications supervisor Maia Jackson told the Coloradoan.\n\nJackson said PRPA has a strong vegetation management program so \"the risk of our transmission lines causing a fire remains low.\"\n\nThere are also protection systems set up to monitor the operations of the transmission lines and automatically open transmission line sections that experience fault conditions, Jackson said.\n\nFort Collins Utilities noted its electrical infrastructure is buried underground and said PRPA's investments in resiliency means a \"significantly reduced risk of wind-related disruptions.\"\n\nCity of Loveland Utilities says 87% of its power infrastructure is underground and the remaining system uses protection measures that reduce the risk of damage that can cause a fire.\n\nPoudre Valley REA supplies electricity to portions of Larimer and Weld counties, including areas like Red Feather Lakes, Livermore, Poudre Canyon, Berthoud and Windsor.\n\nPVREA says it doesn't anticipate planned outages, but high winds could cause unexpected outages.\n\nHere are links to select Northern Colorado power outage maps:\n\nThe Coloradoan will provide updates as needed regarding outages.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Collins Coloradoan: Colorado weather, wind forecast leads to school closures",

The pair, who attend The Colorado Springs School, were visiting the school for a basketball game at the time.\n\n\"We are writing to inform you of a serious situation that occurred last night during our away middle school basketball game in Elbert,\" the Elbert School District said. \"Two of our students left the Elbert campus before the game began, and their whereabouts remain unknown at this time.”\n\nAt the time, Eva and Neilliy, both middle school students, were wearing basketball clothes and backpacks, authorities said.\n\nThe Elbert County Sheriff’s Office added that a search, which involved drones, canines, ATVs and people on foot, had been conducted within a 5-mile radius of the school and was later called off for the night, CBS affiliate KCNC reported.\n\nThen, at a press conference on Tuesday, Dec. 16, Elbert County Undersheriff Dave Fisher said that the two girls were located.\n\n“They are safe, they’re cold, and they are eating breakfast,” Fisher said. Eva and Neilliy were medically evaluated and would be reunited with their families, he added.\n\nFisher said the teens showed up at a stranger's home seven or eight miles from where they disappeared on Tuesday morning. The man fed the girls, kept them warm and called the police.\n\nFisher noted that the girls were cross-country runners and that they did not have their cell phones when they disappeared. It remains unclear why they went missing.\n\n“They’re in good health now,” he said. “I think we can be thankful that they’ve been found and safe.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nDue to the search for the girls, the Elbert School District said early Tuesday morning that the school was closed. Upon the news that the two were found, the school district shared another message that read in part, “We thank our amazing community for the outpouring of support and help.”\n\nPEOPLE contacted the Elbert County Sheriff's Office and The Colorado Springs School on Tuesday for comments.",

    "fullText": "Even as state lawmakers weigh new property tax relief, a new SmartAsset study shows homeowners in North Carolina already pay a lighter property tax bill than many across the country.\n\nSmartAsset ranked 343 of the largest U.S. cities, including 10 cities in the Old North State, based on the percentage of homeowner income that goes to paying property taxes each year.\n\nWhile senior citizens, owner-occupants, and other groups may receive preferential tax treatment in some jurisdictions, homeowners still pay “anywhere from 1% to 10%” of their income on property taxes in the U.S., the study found. Those taxes fund local infrastructure and amenities.\n\nNorth Carolina’s cities ranked 207 or higher, somewhere in the middle between metros with the highest and lowest property tax burdens.\n\nAnother uptake: The state’s larger metros show lower rates than some smaller towns.\n\nHigh Point (No. 207) has the highest rate at 3%. Homeowners pay a median $2,501 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,618 and household income of $83,461.\n\nFayetteville (No. 237) and Greensboro (No. 238) have the second-highest rate at 2.6%. In Fayetteville, homeowners pay a median $2,125 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,492 and household income of $80,642. In Greensboro, homeowners pay a median $2,514 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,517 and household income of $95,627.\n\nDurham (No. 247) has the third-highest rate at 2.5%. Homeowners pay a median $3,443 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,986 and household income of $138,914.\n\nWilmington (No. 250), Cary (No. 254) and Raleigh (No. 257) have the fourth-highest rate at 2.4%. In Wilmington, homeowners pay a median $2,522 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,077 and household income of $103,261. In Cary, homeowners pay a median $4,265 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,477 and household income of $176,652. In Raleigh, homeowners pay a median $3,200 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,061 and household income of $134,182.\n\nConcord (No. 269), Charlotte (No. 272), Winston-Salem (No. 270), share the lowest rate at 2.3%. In Concord, homeowners pay a median $2,803 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,956 and household income of $123,030. In Charlotte, homeowners pay a median $2,976 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,029 and household income of $131,509. In Winston-Salem, homeowners pay a median $2,244 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,622 and household income of $98,894.\n\nPaterson, NJ, has the highest rate at 9.8%. Homeowners pay a median $9,779 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,869 and household income of $100,227.\n\nMontgomery, AL, has the lowest property taxes both relatively and absolutely, with 1.1% of homeowner income going to cover a $917 annual median bill.\n\nWhile North Carolina’s largest cities rank relatively low in property tax burden, lawmakers are still exploring reforms and possible exemptions that could further ease costs.\n\nIn recent years, taxes have jumped for many who live in growing areas with increasing home values, such as the Triangle.\n\nEarlier this month, the state’s House Speaker Destin Hall named 23 House members to a new committee chaired by Republicans, who control the House.\n\nIt’s currently reviewing property tax relief programs to modify or expand them. It’s also considering the frequency of property revaluations for homeowners.\n\nState law requires property value reassessments every eight years, but some counties do them more frequently, including Wake County, which earlier this year moved to a cycle of every two years, The N&O previously reported.\n\n“We’ve seen across the state, especially here in Wake County, but in Caldwell, where I’m from, as well, we’ve seen real estate values go up sometimes 100%, just over four years or so. And it’s made the tax bills go through the roof,” Hall said.\n\nThe committee plans to finish its work, and submit any proposed legislation, before the 2026 session begins.",

    "description": "Today, in surprising rumors...",
    "fullText": "A very surprising name emerged today as a suggested way for Arizona to address their third-base situation. Would you believe, three-time All-Star, Alex Bregman? According to USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, “The Arizona Diamondbacks have become a surprise entrant in the Alex Bregman sweepstakes and are ‘kicking the tires’ on the possibility.” Nick Piecoro subsequently confirmed the interest: “A source indicated that the way such an agreement could come together would be if Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick, the club’s managing general partner, opted to increase the team’s spending power.”\n\nThat would seem to go against what ownership have publicly been saying this offseason. Both owner Ken Kendrick and team president Derrick Hall have said the team will look to rein in payroll, on the back of consecutive seasons with record salary, but coming up short of the playoffs. The team has already spent what was expected to be most of the available resources, on adding free-agent pitchers Michael Soroka and Merrill Kelly. Another alternative would be to trade away salary. The obvious name there is Ketel Marte, around whom rumors have already been swirling. He is due to earn $15 million next year. But that would only defray the expected price for Bregman. MLB Trade Rumors projects the free-agent to get a contract of six years, and $160 million, an AAV of almost $27 million.\n\nThe scenario might start off with trading Marte – maybe to the Red Sox, who are one of the main suitors for Bergman, since he has played for them last year – for pitching. Move Jordan Lawlar to play second-base, and sign Bregman as a long-term solution at the hot corner. However, one of the things which weighs against this, is simply the fact we are hearing about it. GM Mike Hazen has habitually kept a very tight ship in regard to his moves. Did we hear anything about the signing of Corbin Burnes, for example? In fact, I’m hard pushed to think of a major move in his era, which was solidly rumored in advance of becoming a fact [and I’m not counting the re-signing of Merrill Kelly]. The finances are also a problem. So, for now, I’m still skeptical. But, hey, it certainly makes for more interesting times than waiting for Hazen to do something!",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza returns home with the Heisman and unfinished business originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza brought the Heisman Trophy back to Bloomington but made it clear the season’s most important work still lies ahead.\n\nFernando Mendoza arrived at the podium with the Heisman Trophy at his side. Its presence was heavy and unmistakable, a reflection of where Indiana football now stands.\n\nIndiana is 13–0. A Big Ten champion. Home to a Heisman winner. And yet nothing about Mendoza’s message sounded like a victory lap. This was not a moment to linger in. It was one to acknowledge, honor, and then move past.\n\n“This page is folded,” Mendoza said. “Our focus right now is winning the College Football Playoff.”\n\nThat balance defined the afternoon. Mendoza spoke about responsibility and humility, about the fraternity of Heisman winners and how the weight of the trophy only grows with time. He also spoke with emotion about family, heritage, and why it mattered to him to address his grandparents in Spanish on college football’s biggest stage.\n\n“All four of my grandparents were born and raised in Cuba,” Mendoza said. “They emigrated to the United States and sacrificed so much to support my parents and then my parents to support myself.”\n\nFor Mendoza, the moment extended beyond his own family. He referenced fellow Heisman finalist Diego Pavia, the Vanderbilt quarterback, and the sight of an entire family showing up together, something that resonated deeply.\n\n“You see like Diego Pavia’s family, he had like 100 people there too,” Mendoza said. “That’s just how the Hispanic culture is. The Hispanic family is so prideful and supportive of one another.”\n\nMORE: Jeff Monken struggles to put words to Army’s heartbreaking loss to Navy\n\nThat connection made the moment bigger than an individual award.\n\n“I thought saying something in Spanish would mean a lot to them,” Mendoza said. “And also for the Hispanic community out there, because I know there’s a lot of Hispanic football fans.”\n\nHe acknowledged the responsibility that comes with visibility, especially for young players who may not see themselves reflected in college football’s most celebrated moments.\n\n“It’s something that I’m looking forward to represent,” Mendoza said.\n\nFernando described himself as a different player than the one who arrived in spring, a transformation he said even his teammates did not foresee. Once a two star recruit committed to Yale, he now stands as the face of the most accomplished season in Indiana football history. He did not frame it as destiny. He framed it as preparation, accountability, and trust in the people around him.\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff expansion proposals that could have changed everything for Notre Dame and BYU\n\nThe Heisman Trophy mattered. The symbolism mattered. Indiana football changed in that room. But Mendoza made one thing clear. The season’s meaning will not be defined by what sits on a podium.\n\nIndiana will face the winner of Alabama and Oklahoma on New Year’s Day at the Rose Bowl with a path to the national championship now fully in view.\n\nBrian Hartline sends a message to Chris Henry Jr. after choosing Ohio State\n\nDeion Sanders expected to lose key staff member to Group of Five school\n\nTavita Pritchard comes home to Stanford with a message of ‘belief and brotherhood’",

    "fullText": "UNC improved to 10-1 on the season with a 77-58 win over East Tennessee State in the Dean Dome on Tuesday night. The Tar Heels and Buccaneers played a fairly evenly matched first half that saw Carolina go to the locker room with just an eight-point lead before turning on the jets and putting plenty of distance between them and ETSU in the second half.\n\nCarolina was led by a career night from Henri Veesar. The Heels’ started three guys taller than the tallest ETSU player and Veesaar definitely took advantage of it down low. He finished with 26 points and eight rebounds before the starters were pulled after the game was well in hand. Veesaar’s 26 points beat his previous career-high of 24 points that he scored against St. Bonaventure. Caleb Wilson also put on a show, scoring 20 points and pulling down eight boards. No other Tar Heels finished in double figures. Derek Dixon finished with seven points in 14 minutes of action. Kyan Evans scored six points to go with his six assists and no turnovers. Jarin Stevenson had six points and four assists as well.\n\nThe second half was so lopsided that at one point Carolina had out-scored the Buccaneers 22-9. Hubert Davis decided to give the bench some extended minutes, which gave ETSU an opportunity to to make the score more respectable. Still, the Heels shot 46% from the field in the second half. Free throw shooting continues to leave something to be desired, if you’re looking for nits to pick, but it wasn’t a factor in this one.\n\nAfter last year’s deficiencies with size down low, it is so nice to see a Carolina team be able to bully a smaller opponent with guys like Veesaar and Wilson. They present a big challenge for other teams, especially when they are both firing on all cylinders the way they were tonight.\n\nTwo non-conference games remain for the Tar Heels before they start ACC play against Florida State on New Year’s Eve Eve. Next up is Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic on Saturday which may feature the return of Seth Trimble.",

    "fullText": "Nebraska QB Dylan Raiola hit with brutal reality check from Will Compton amid portal move originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt is beginning to settle in that Nebraska Cornhuskers quarterback Dylan Raiola won't remain in Lincoln next fall.\n\nFor former Cornhuskers linebacker-turned-podcast host Will Compton, he is open to a fresh start for his alma.\n\n\"It is what it is,” Compton said on \"Bussin' With the Boys.\" “Personally, it’s like, I know he had the injury with the broken leg and everything else. What he’s done, what Dylan has meant to Nebraska for the last couple years – he’s a hell of a player, hell of a talent, hell of an athlete.\"\n\nCompton said Raiola leaving was inevitable. It was just a matter of when.\n\n“Now that he’s [going] in the portal, everything that I’ve heard behind the scenes and everything else, I kind of knew that this was coming,\" Compton said. \"At this point, it’s more like, it is what it is. This is the world we live in now. And he’s not the guy that’s going to be the quarterback under center for Nebraska next year. So whoever that next guy’s going to be – whether it’s in-house right now or somebody we get out of the portal – I’m going to be the biggest fan.”\n\nCompton suggested that NIL potentially played a factor, but didn't go into specifics as to why he knew that this was happening.\n\n\" How I went through Nebraska, how you think of [it] has a competitor and everything else you see with this NIL world, I was hopeful that he would be in this process of getting healthy and everything else, and want to continue to build on the little success that we’ve had over the last couple years and continue to be the guy and continue to run into the fight and bring this program back to what we want it to be,\" Compton said.\n\nAs for what's next, Compton said he is unsure who the new quarterback could be, but says Nebraska will eventually be better off once it figures it out.\n\n“That’s not surprising,” Compton said. \"\n\n“I knew that that was coming. … I’ve spoke with people over the weekend. Those conversations will stay with me and who I was talking to,\" Compton said. “But all the evidence has let up to, he’s going to be hitting the portal at some point. … Listen, we’re going to find us a quarterback. Not even worried about this.”\n\nFor now, Nebraska is a little under two weeks away from playing in a bowl game which could easily springboard how next year may transpire\n\nWhat happens next, though, could potentially define coach Matt Rhule's tenure, who admitted he is dissatisfied with where the program is and knows he can do better.\n\n“This season is not good enough for the standard that we want to set at Nebraska,” Rhule said. “Back-to-back bowl bowl seasons for the first time in a long time, all that’s great. But we have higher expectations for what we want to get done. We ended the season on a real down note, losing the last two games and by a score that wasn’t representative of the team that went out and played Michigan and USC and earlier in the year.”",

    "title": "Louisiana vs Delaware Prediction, Picks & Best Bets for December 17 — 68 Ventures Bowl",
    "description": "Our Louisiana vs. Delaware predictions expect the Blue Hens to ride their passing game to victory in the 68 Ventures Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Bowl season rolls right along as we get into the thick of the matchups when the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens take on the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns.\n\nIt’s one of the few bowl games that at least appears to be void of many significant opt-outs for either side.\n\nI break down the matchup in my Louisiana vs. Delaware predictions and college football picks for the 68 Ventures Bowl below.\n\nI think the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens win. They have the more reliable passing efficiency, and Louisiana’s tendency to allow opponents to stay on schedule through the air is a problem. It should allow them to make enough plays to come up with the W.\n\nFrom a bowl game perspective, this is one of the easier handicaps you’ll have. Both teams have some injuries, but there are virtually no opt-outs, along with normal prep and rest to get ready for this matchup. I’m riding with Delaware to cover at +2.5 as my best bet. I think this is basically a coin flip.\n\nQuarterback Nick Minicucci has been the driving force for Delaware. This is a very efficient passing game, and he’s completed over 60% of his passes for more than 1,400 yards. He’ll attack a Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns secondary that's been rather leaky, ranking 119th nationally in defensive success rate and 99th in pass success rate allowed.\n\nLouisiana has been the opposite. They’ve gotten modest production from the passing game all season and have leaned into a running committee led by Bill Davis to get the job done. That feels like it will be a problem against a solid Delaware defensive front that has kept the explosives on the ground at bay.\n\nI’d rather have the quarterback and passing game that can stay on schedule and has a clearer path to victory in this matchup.\n\nIt’s an all-Blue Hens SGP that holds true to the thought process of our best bet. The biggest advantage in this matchup for either team is the Delaware aerial attack against the Louisiana secondary, so why overthink it?\n\nWe're taking Nick Minicucci to have a big day through the air, hooking up regularly with one of his top targets in Sean Wilson.\n\nNick Minicucci Over 262.5 passing yards\n\nSean Wilson Over 56.5 receiving yards\n\nLouisiana is going to at least try to run the ball, which is going to bleed the clock. On the other side, I do think that the Delaware passing game will succeed, but it will likely involve a more methodical approach through intermediate passes.\n\nWe'll finish with Minicucci to throw 2+ passing touchdowns. Naturally, if he's having success through the air, there's a good chance he'll accomplish this. This position is strengthened by Delaware having issues at points this season running the ball in short-yardage situations.\n\nNick Minicucci Over 262.5 passing yards\n\nNick Minicucci Over 1.5 passing touchdowns\n\nSean Wilson Over 56.5 receiving yards\n\nSpread: Louisiana -2.5 | Delaware +2.5\n\nMoneyline: Louisiana -150 | Delaware +125\n\nOver/Under: Over 62.5 | Under 62.5\n\nLouisiana has cashed its team total Over in nine of its last 10 games for +7.85 units and a 67% ROI.

    "fullText": "The Old Dominion Monarchs (9-3) travel to Camping World Stadium for their StaffDNA Cure Bowl against the South Florida Bulls (9-3)\n\nWith both star quarterbacks opting out, my Old Dominion vs. South Florida predictions anticipate a low-scoring affair.\n\nRead on for my college football picks for Wednesday, December 17.\n\nI’m leaning toward Old Dominion to pull off the upset. The Monarchs are only missing their quarterback, but their coaching staff and defense remain intact.\n\nSouth Florida enters with far more disruption, including a new interim head coach and a reshuffled offense, making Old Dominion the more stable and reliable side.\n\nWednesday’s Cure Bowl matchup between the Old Dominion Monarchs and South Florida Bulls sets up as a lower-scoring, grind-it-out game.\n\nBoth teams enter with major question marks at quarterback, and inexperience at the position often leads to conservative play-calling, fewer explosive plays, and an emphasis on protecting the football.\n\nOld Dominion will turn to freshman Quinn Henicle, while South Florida starts journeyman Gaston Moore, an inexperienced combination that points toward the Under.\n\nDefensively, both units have proven capable of limiting points; Old Dominion allowed just 19.5 points per game during the regular season, while South Florida surrendered 23.\n\nThose are solid defensive numbers that reflect good red-zone defense and an ability to turn long, time-consuming drives into field goals.\n\nNeither defense was prone to getting gashed for quick scores during the regular season, and I don’t expect that to change with backup quarterbacks under center.\n\nThe continuity of Old Dominion’s stop unit, combined with a stout USF defense and likely ground-first approach from both offenses, should lead to a low-scoring Cure Bowl.\n\nNeither offense should score more than 24 points, especially with Old Dominion turning to Henicle after Colton Joseph opted out.\n\nSouth Florida has allowed fewer than 24 points in three of its last four games, reinforcing the case for the Under on Old Dominion’s team total.\n\nI also trust the largely intact Monarchs' defense to keep this contest within one score, allowing ODU to stay competitive and its offense to cover the number.\n\nOld Dominion team total Under 24.5\n\nSpread: Old Dominion +3.5 (-110) | South Florida -3.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Old Dominion +138 | South Florida -164\n\nOver/Under: Over 53.5 (-110) | Under 53.5 (-110)\n\nOld Dominion has hit the Game Total Under in their last five games (+5.00 Units / 91% ROI).

    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio – It was the back end of a back-to-back to close out a long Eastern road trip, and it certainly looked like it at plenty of points for the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nAnaheim did salvage a point to finish even on the road trip, but the Columbus Blue Jackets grabbed the extra point on a blazing overtime strike from Adam Fantilli in a 4-3 victory on Tuesday at Nationwide Arena.\n\nJackson LaCombe scored the equalizer off the back of Blue Jackets goalie Jet Greaves’ helmet with just over three minutes remaining. Anaheim and Columbus traded a combined four goals over a two-minute stretch in the second period, with Ryan Strome and Mikael Granlund. Zach Werenski scored twice for the Blue Jackets.\n\n“It’s never the easiest ones to play these back-to-back,” Granlund said on the Ducks Victory+ broadcast. “Obviously, we wanted the two points. It’s never easy, and at least we got the one point. Let’s move on from here.”\n\nVille Husso took the start in the second half of the back-to-back and stopped 24 of 28 shots.\n\nThe Ducks went 0-for-4 on the power play and killed off both Blue Jackets power plays in the third period.\n\nAnaheim finished up the five-game road trip at 2-2-1 with five of a possible 10 points. The Ducks return home for three games going into the Christmas break, starting on Friday against Dallas.\n\nThe Ducks (21-12-2, 42 points) edged into first place in the Pacific Division, but Vegas (16-6-9, 41 points) has three games in hand on Anaheim.\n\nAnaheim has equalized. Jackson LaCombe sends it in off the back of Jet Greaves' head from below the goal line, and the Ducks have erased the deficit.\n\n3-3 in Columbus. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/8JW7GRwe96\n\n— Zach Cavanagh (@ZachCav) December 17, 2025\n\nIt was an eventful road trip for Ducks defenseman Jackson LaCombe, who scored three goals and four points on the five-game road trip. LaCombe has points in six of the last seven games.\n\nTwo of LaCombe’s three goals on the road trip came from below the goal line.\n\nLaCombe scored the first goal of the trip with a sharp-angle shot coming down the left wing in Pittsburgh. On Tuesday, LaCombe tied the game off an even sharper angle coming down the left wing. The blue liner dropped below the goal line and shot off the back of the Columbus netminder’s helmet and in.\n\nLaCombe also popped in a shorthanded goal last night in New York City.\n\nThe 24-year-old paced the Ducks defensive corps in Columbus with 58.88% expected goal share at five-on-five.\n\nDucks even it up. Fourth line strikes with a give and go between Ryan Poehling and Ryan Strome, and Strome pots it.\n\n1-1. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/NTvi5eqOzQ\n\n— Zach Cavanagh (@ZachCav) December 17, 2025\n\nThe combination of Ross Johnston, Ryan Poehling and Ryan Strome led the Ducks’ offensive efforts at five-on-five.\n\nStrome scored off a give-and-go with Poehling for the Ducks’ first goal in the second period.\n\nIn 7:49 time-on-ice at five-on-five, the trio earned 88.36% of expected goals with a punishing forecheck. This was in sharp contrast to the second line of Chris Kreider, Mason McTavish and Beckett Sennecke, who combined for 9.34% expected goal share in 8:07 time-on-ice while struggling to clear the zone.\n\nOn a night where the Ducks looked gassed, energy shifts from the fourth line kept Anaheim within striking distance.\n\nDespite Cutter Gauthier sniping a power play goal off the rush in New York last night, Anaheim went 0-for-4 on the power play with just five shots with the extra man on Tuesday. The Ducks have gone 1-for-12 on the power play over the last five games and are 3-for-31 over the last 10 games.\n\nGauthier nearly put in another on the power play, as he beat the Columbus goalie five-hole in the final minute of the first period. However, the puck trickled through the netminder and off the far post to keep the power play off the board.\n\nAs he calls his 2,000th @AnaheimDucks regular-season game tonight, @DucksStream's Steve Carroll visits the TV booth to reminisce about playing drums, working in nightclubs, calling virtually every sport in existence and many other great memories throughout his distinguished… pic.twitter.com/DYlDn0PW1B\n\n— Victory+ (@victoryplustv) December 17, 2025\n\nIt was a momentous night on the broadcast side, as Ducks audio play-by-play Steve Carroll called his 2,000th regular-season game for Anaheim on Tuesday in Columbus. The Ducks have played 2,472 regular season games in franchise history, and Carroll has been the radio voice of the Ducks since 1999.\n\nMuch has changed in Carroll’s 27 seasons with Anaheim, going from terrestrial radio broadcasts over various airwaves to now online broadcasts via Ducks Stream on the TuneIn app.\n\nCarroll has been behind a microphone for nearly 50 years as a play-by-play broadcaster calling NHL hockey, minor league baseball, minor league hockey, pro soccer, college football and college basketball with broadcasts in every state except Alaska and Idaho.\n\nCarroll will be inducted into the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame next month.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Angels added some bullpen depth with a pair of signings on Monday evening, reportedly agreeing to deals with right-hander Jordan Romano and left-hander Drew Pomeranz.\n\nRomano, a 32-year-old two-time All-Star, spent the 2025 campaign as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. He struggled mightily, posting an 8.23 ERA in 49 total appearances.\n\nHe had appeared in just 15 games the season before for the Toronto Blue Jays, working to a 6.59 ERA and missing the majority of the year with an elbow injury. The right-hander had previously found promise in Toronto, earning back-to-back All-Star selections in 2022 and 2023 while recording 72 saves during that stretch.\n\nLos Angeles will look to help him return to the version of himself that tallied 95 saves from 2021-2023, holding an ERA below 2.20 in two of those seasons. His one-year deal with the Halos is worth $2 million.\n\nDrew Pomeranz heads to the Angels following an impressive return to baseball in 2025 with the Chicago Cubs, where he pitched 49 2/3 innings with a 2.17 ERA. The 37-year-old did not appear in the Major Leagues from 2022-2024, battling injury setbacks and working to return his body to health.\n\nNow, the 12-year veteran will look to build on his momentum from an inspiring comeback season, with Los Angeles looking for another reliable left-handed option. Pomeranz joins Brock Burke as the only other current southpaw option in the bullpen.\n\nThe Angels continue to load up on players who have shown past flashes of promise despite recent struggles or injury setbacks. This time around, it's a pair of players in Romano and Pomeranz that will look to add much-needed consistency to a bullpen that finished 2025 with the highest ERA in the American League.",

(Elio Della Ferrara/Stelvio National Park via AP)\n\nLombardy Region president Attilio Fontana attends a press conference in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, on a discovery of thousands of dinosaur tracks in Lombardy region. \n\nMILAN (AP) — A wildlife photographer stumbled upon one of the oldest and largest known collections of dinosaur footprints, dating back about 210 million years to the Triassic Period, high in an Italian national park near the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympic venue of Bormio, officials announced Tuesday.\n\nThe discovery in the Stelvio National Park was striking for the sheer number of footprints, estimated at as many as 20,000 over some five kilometers (three miles), and the location near the Swiss border, once a prehistoric coastal area, that has never previously yielded dinosaur tracks, experts said.\n\n“This time reality really surpasses fantasy,’’ said Cristiano Dal Sasso, a paleontologist at Milan’s Natural History Museum, who received the first call from wildlife photographer Elio Della Ferrera after making the discovery.\n\nThe dinosaur prints are believed to have been made by long-necked bipedal herbivores that were up to 10 meters (33 feet) long, weighing up to four tons, similar to a Plateosaurus, Dal Sasso said. Some of the tracks were 40 centimeters wide, with visible claws.\n\nThe footprints indicated that the dinosaurs traveled in packs and they sometimes stopped in circular formations, possibly as a protective measure.\n\n“There are very obvious traces of individuals that have walked at a slow, calm, quiet rhythmic pace, without running,’’ Dal Sasso told a press conference.\n\nThe tracks were discovered by Della Ferrera, who set out to photograph deer and vultures in September when his camera was trained on a vertical wall about 600 meters (nearly 2,000 feet) above the nearest road.\n\nThe location, some 2,400 to 2,800 meters (7,900-9,200 feet) above sea level on a north-facing wall that is mostly in the shade, made the footprints, though in plain sight, particularly hard to spot without a very strong lens, Dal Sasso said.\n\nDella Ferra said something strange caught his eye, and he scaled a vertical rock wall with some difficulty to get a closer look.\n\n“The huge surprise was not so much in discovering the footprints, but in discovering such a huge quantity,’’ Della Ferrara said. “There are really tens of thousands of prints up there, more or less well-preserved.’’\n\nThe entrance of the park, where the prints were discovered, is located just two kilometers (a mile) from the mountain town of Bormio, where Men’s Alpine skiing will be held during the Feb. 6-22 Games.\n\nLombardy regional governor, Attilio Fontana, hailed the discovery as a “gift for the Olympics,” even if the site is too remote to access in the winter, and plans for eventual public access have not been made.",

    "description": "Small language models (SLMs) are compact LLMs designed to run efficiently in resource-constrained environments. They are now good enough for many production workloads.",
    "fullText": "When running open-source LLMs in production, you probably hit GPU limits faster than expected.\n\nVRAM fills up quickly. The KV cache grows with every request. Latency spikes as soon as concurrency increases. A model that works fine in a demo actually needs multiple high-end GPUs for production.\n\nFor many teams, proprietary models like GPT-5 feel like an easy way out. A simple API call hides the complexity of GPU memory management, batching, and scaling. However, that convenience comes with trade-offs: vendor lock-in, limited customization, unpredictable pricing at scale, and ongoing concerns about data privacy.\n\nThis tension brings teams back to self-hosting. The good news is that you no longer need large models to get strong results. Over the past year, advances in distillation, training data, and post-training have made small language models far more capable than their parameter counts suggest. Many now deliver solid reasoning, coding, and agentic performance, and fit comfortably on a single GPU.\n\nIn this post, we’ll look at the best open-source small language models, and explain when and why they make sense in certain cases. After that, we’ll answer some FAQs teams have when evaluating them for production deployments.\n\nSmall language models (SLMs) are best defined by their deployability, not just their parameter count. In practice, the term usually refers to models ranging from a few hundred million to around 10 billion parameters that can run reliably in resource-constrained environments.\n\nSome people might think SLMs are impractical for production. They are faster and cheaper to run, but noticeably weaker at reasoning, coding, and instruction following tasks. In fact, that gap has narrowed significantly with recent advances:\n\nToday, many popular open-source LLM families offer small parameter variants that are strong enough for production use. They power chatbots, agent pipelines, and high-throughput automation workflows where latency, cost, and operational simplicity matter more than sheer model size.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the top SLMs.\n\nGemma-3n-E2B-IT is an instruction-tuned multimodal small model from Google DeepMind, built for on-device and other low-resource deployments. It accepts text, image, audio, and video inputs and generates text outputs.\n\nWhile the raw parameter count is around 5B, it uses selective parameter activation, so it can run with a memory footprint closer to a traditional 2B model in many deployments.\n\nThe Gemma 3n family is trained on data spanning 140+ languages, which is a big deal if you need multilingual support without jumping to much larger models.\n\nWhy should you use Gemma-3n-E2B-IT:\n\nPhi-4-mini-instruct is a lightweight, instruction-tuned model from Microsoft’s Phi-4 family. It is trained on a mix of high-quality synthetic data and carefully filtered public datasets, with a strong emphasis on reasoning-dense content.\n\nWith only 3.8B parameters, Phi-4-mini-instruct shows reasoning and multilingual performance comparable to much larger models in the 7B–9B range, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. It’s a solid choice for teams that want strong instruction following and reasoning without the operational overhead of larger models.\n\nWhy should you use Phi-4-mini-instruct:\n\nLimited factual knowledge. Phi-4-mini-instruct doesn’t store large amounts of world knowledge. It may produce inaccurate or outdated facts, especially for knowledge-heavy or long-tail queries. I suggest you pair it with RAG or external tools for production use.\n\nLanguage performance varies. Although it supports multiple languages, performance outside English can be uneven. Non-English or low-resource languages should be carefully benchmarked before deployment.\n\nSensitive to prompt format. Phi-4-mini-instruct performs best with its recommended chat and function-calling formats. Otherwise, it can negatively impact instruction adherence and output quality. For example, you should use the following format for general conversation and instructions:\n\nQwen3-0.6B is the smallest dense model in Alibaba’s Qwen3 family, released under the Apache 2.0 license. Despite its tiny size, it inherits much of what makes Qwen3 notable: strong reasoning, improved agent and tool-use capabilities, and broad multilingual support.\n\nArchitecturally, Qwen3-0.6B is a 0.6B parameter causal LM with 32K context length. Like the rest of the Qwen3 line, it supports a hybrid behavior pattern that can switch between deeper reasoning and faster responses depending on your use case.\n\nStrong capability for a sub-1B model. If you want something meaningfully stronger than “toy” small models, but still lightweight enough for low-cost deployments, Qwen3-0.6B is a solid baseline. In some evaluations, it’s competitive even against much larger models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.\n\nMultilingual out of the box. Qwen3 supports 100+ languages and dialects, and Qwen3-0.6B benefits from that training focus. It is an ideal choice for on-device global products that can’t afford larger multilingual models.\n\nAgent and tool-use friendly ecosystem. Qwen3 is designed with agent workflows in mind, and the tooling around it (templates, parsers, Qwen-Agent) reduces integration friction.\n\nIf you can afford a bit more compute, I also recommend Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B. They keep the same hybrid reasoning and agent-friendly design, but offer better performance for more complex tasks than the 0.6B model.\n\nSmolLM3-3B is a fully open instruct and reasoning model from Hugging Face. At the 3B scale, it outperforms Llama-3.2-3B and Qwen2.5-3B, while staying competitive with many 4B-class alternatives (including Qwen3 and Gemma 3) across 12 popular LLM benchmarks.\n\nWhat also sets SmolLM3 apart is the level of transparency. Hugging Face published the full engineering blueprint of it, including architecture decisions, data mixture, and post-training methodology. If you’re building internal variants or want to understand what actually drives quality at 3B, that matters.\n\nMinistral-3-3B-Instruct-2512 is a multimodal SLM developed by Mistral AI. It’s the smallest instruct model in the Ministral 3 family, designed specifically for edge and resource-constrained deployments.\n\nArchitecturally, it combines a 3.4B language model with a 0.4B vision encoder, supporting basic visual understanding alongside chat and instruction following. In practice, it can run on a single GPU and fit into roughly 8 GB of VRAM in FP8, or even less with further quantization.\n\nWhy should you use Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512:\n\nNow let’s take a look at some FAQs.\n\nThere’s no strict cutoff, but in practice, SLMs usually fall in the sub-1B to ~10B parameter range. Models in this range can often run on a single GPU without sharding or complex distributed inference setups.\n\nYes, for many use cases. Modern SLMs benefit from better training data, distillation, and post-training techniques, making them far more capable than earlier generations. In fact, you don’t need GPT-5.2-level capability for most real-world tasks.\n\nOne of their biggest advantages is fine-tuning. Small models are easier and cheaper to fine-tune on proprietary data such as internal documents, domain-specific workflows, or product knowledge. In narrow or specialized tasks, a well fine-tuned small model can outperform much larger general-purpose models, running faster and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAs a result, SLMs are widely used in production for internal copilots, agent workflows and automation.\n\nOpen-source SLMs offer several advantages compared to LLMs, especially in production environments:\n\nFor many real-world applications, open-source SLMs provide a better balance of performance, cost, and operational simplicity.\n\nThe key differences come down to scale, cost, and operational complexity, which directly affect how and where each type of model makes sense in production.\n\nSLMs aren’t a compromise anymore. Used well, they’re often one of the fastest paths to reliable, scalable AI in production.\n\nWhy? Today, you’re not building AI products around a single model. You’re building AI systems.\n\nMany production setups combine multiple models with different strengths: SLMs for fast, cost-efficient inference, larger models for harder reasoning, and specialized vision or speech models where needed. In that kind of system, SLMs play a critical role. They’re easier to fine-tune, cheaper to run, and simple to scale, which makes them ideal building blocks for real-world AI workflows.\n\nTrying to build modern AI systems? This is where the Bento Inference Platform comes in. Bento lets you chain multiple models together, route traffic intelligently, and scale each component independently. You can mix SLMs and larger models freely, without locking your architecture to a single model or vendor.\n\nIf you’re thinking about running SLMs in production, we’d love to help.",

    "description": "Quarterly payments of $200 to be offered via stablecoin or traditional currency in a scheme designed to ease cost of living pressures in the Pacific nation",
    "fullText": "Quarterly payments of $200 to be offered via stablecoin or traditional currency in a scheme designed to ease cost of living pressures in the Pacific nation\n\nThe Marshall Islands has introduced a national universal basic income (UBI) scheme that offers payments via cryptocurrency, alongside more traditional methods, which experts say is the first scheme of its kind in the world.\n\nUnder the program, every resident citizen of the Marshall Islands will receive quarterly payments of about US$200 as part of a government effort to ease cost of living pressures. The first instalments were paid in late November and recipients can choose whether the money is paid into a bank account, by cheque, or delivered as cryptocurrency on the blockchain through a government-backed digital wallet.\n\n“We the government want to make sure no one is left behind,” Marshall Islands’ minister for finance David Paul told the Guardian.\n\n“$200 per person per quarter, which is about $800 a year, does not compel you to quit your job … but it’s actually like a morale booster for people.”\n\nAn archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, the Marshall Islands lies between Hawaii and Australia, and has a population of about 42,000. Paul said the payments were intended as a “social safety net” as the country faces rising costs and citizens leaving.\n\nThe UBI scheme is financed by a trust fund created under an agreement with the United States, which in part aims to compensate the Marshall Islands for decades of American nuclear testing. The fund holds more than $1.3bn in assets, with the US committing a further $500m through to 2027.\n\nDr Huy Pham, associate professor and crypto-fintech lead at RMIT University, said the Marshall Islands scheme “is the world first for a national rollout of a UBI program.” He said the use of blockchain technology is “unique in terms of a nation-wide implementation.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency delivery option – which involves the transfer of a digital token known as a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar – was designed to address the practical challenge of delivering the money across hundreds of remote islands.\n\n“We saw the opportunity in what the blockchain has to offer,” Paul said.\n\nBlockchain is best known as the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but can also be used to store and transfer more traditional assets – like government bonds – which the Marshall Islands is using to underpin their digital payment scheme.\n\nBut according to Pham, digital payments alone do not necessarily provide financial inclusion, especially in a country like the Marshall Islands where internet connectivity is patchy and frequently disrupted.\n\n“Improving internet coverage, improving smartphone penetration – all these kinds of things are the minimum for a blockchain-based economy,” he said.\n\nMost recipients are choosing to receive payments through conventional channels. According to the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration, about 60% of the first round of payments were deposited directly into bank accounts, with the remainder issued as paper checks. Only a small number of people – about 12 so far, officials say – have signed up to receive payments on their digital wallet\n\nAnelie Sarana, the finance manager involved in the rollout, said over the past year her team has travelled to the outermost islands of the country to register people in the scheme.\n\nSarana said many recipients were using the money immediately for basic needs, like food and essentials, while others used the $200 to pay for celebrations to commemorate the annual Gospel Day holiday which coincided with the first distribution.\n\n“I know they’re happy, because you can see in the streets, there’s so much traffic, it’s like there’s a big something happening,” she said.\n\nThis is not the first time the Marshall Islands has experimented with using cryptocurrency. In 2018, the government attempted to create a national cryptocurrency known as the Sovereign, or SOV. The plan ultimately stalled after warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe IMF has cautioned that while the technology underpinning the latest scheme is innovative, the blockchain-based delivery of universal basic income carries “financial, fiscal, legal, reputational, and financial integrity risks”, particularly if governance and oversight are not robust.\n\nDr Monique Taylor, a lecturer in world politics at the University of Helsinki, said it was hard to predict if the Marshall Islands’ experiment with a universal basic income and a cryptocurrency delivery system would succeed.\n\n“Universal income schemes are rare, particularly at national scale, and there are no direct precedents that combine this fiscal architecture with a digital delivery component in a small island state,” she said.\n\nBut, she believed the scheme did present benefits for small island nations.\n\n“In a geographically dispersed island state where conventional banking infrastructure can be limited, a digital wallet may lower frictions and make transfers more accessible, particularly in outer atolls,” she said.",

    "title": "Optimizing Claude Code",
    "description": "Customize Claude Code with skills, plugins, commands, and configuration files that transform a capable coding assistant into one that matches your exact workflow.",
    "fullText": "I’ve been using Claude Code for months now, and for most of that time, I was doing it wrong. Not wrong in the sense of getting bad results—the defaults are remarkably capable. Wrong in the sense that I was treating a customizable system like a fixed tool. I was adjusting my workflow to fit the AI instead of adjusting the AI to fit my workflow.\n\nThe difference between default Claude Code and a properly configured instance is the difference between hiring a talented generalist and hiring someone who’s worked at your company for years. Both can write code. Only one knows that your team prefers for…of over .forEach(), that you never use the I prefix on interfaces, and that when you say “analyze this bug,” you mean a specific six-step process that includes hypothesis testing.\n\nHere’s how I built that second version.\n\nClaude Code’s customization system has multiple layers, each serving a different purpose:\n\nWhat’s less widely appreciated is how these layers interact. When Claude Code starts a session, it reads your settings, loads relevant skills based on context, and injects CLAUDE.md into its system prompt. When you invoke a command, it triggers a predefined workflow. When you mention a topic covered by a skill, Claude applies that expertise automatically.\n\nMy ~/.claude/settings.json is minimal but deliberate:\n\nalwaysThinkingEnabled: true — This enables extended thinking on every response. The tradeoff is latency for quality. For complex refactoring or architectural decisions, I want Claude to think deeply. For quick questions, it’s overkill. I keep it on because my typical use case is substantial engineering work.\n\nToken limits — Increasing CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS to 64000 prevents truncation on large refactors. The MAX_THINKING_TOKENS setting controls how much “thinking” space Claude has before responding.\n\nincludeCoAuthoredBy: false — I don’t need AI authorship attribution in every commit message. Personal preference.\n\nThe full settings file is available in my dotfiles repo.\n\nEvery project gets a CLAUDE.md at the root. This is where you encode project-specific knowledge: commands to build and test, directory structure, coding principles, workflow patterns.\n\nThe key insight: CLAUDE.md is a system prompt you control. Every instruction you put here shapes every response you get. You can define escalation patterns that tell Claude to stop thrashing and switch to a structured process after failed attempts—for example, my Bug Fix workflow triggers a 6-step root cause analysis after two failed fixes.\n\nFull template: CLAUDE.md in dotfiles\n\nSkills are markdown files that encode specialized knowledge. When Claude detects that a skill is relevant to your task, it applies that expertise automatically.\n\nThis skill encodes my team’s TypeScript conventions—things that aren’t in style guides but matter for consistency:\n\nThe full skill covers interfaces vs types, enum conventions, null handling, type assertions, and module imports. It’s 700+ lines because TypeScript has a lot of conventions worth encoding.\n\nFor Lambda, DynamoDB, and SQS patterns:\n\nThis skill catches AI-generated code patterns that don’t match human-written code:\n\nThis is something I’ve noticed consistently: AI models add defensive code and comments that human developers wouldn’t. Having a skill that explicitly tells Claude to avoid these patterns makes the output feel more natural.\n\nSkills directory: skills in dotfiles\n\nSkills teach Claude how to code. Hooks enforce that it does. The difference matters.\n\nA skill might say “prefer for…of over .forEach()“—but Claude can still forget. A hook catches it in real-time, warning or blocking before the code is written. It’s the difference between training and guardrails.\n\nI use the hookify plugin to create enforcement rules from simple markdown files. Here are my active hooks:\n\nHooks are markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Here’s an example that blocks as any casts:\n\nThe action field determines severity:\n\nThis is where customization compounds. My TypeScript patterns skill teaches Claude the conventions. My hooks enforce them. If Claude violates a convention—say, using as Type instead of <Type>—the hook catches it before the code is written.\n\nThe feedback loop is immediate: Claude sees the warning, adjusts its output, and continues. Since Claude Code is stateless between sessions, the hooks provide consistent enforcement every time. Skills inform, hooks enforce.\n\nHooks directory: hooks in dotfiles\n\nCommands are like shell aliases for Claude workflows. Instead of typing a detailed prompt, you invoke /analyze-bug or /simplify and get a consistent, structured response.\n\nCommands directory: commands in dotfiles\n\nAgent docs are markdown files in .claude/agent_docs/ that Claude reads when relevant. Unlike skills (which encode how to do things), agent docs provide reference material (what things are).\n\nCLAUDE.md tells Claude when to read each doc. More efficient than stuffing everything into context—Claude loads docs on demand.\n\nAgent docs: agent_docs in dotfiles\n\nPlugins add new tools and workflows to Claude’s toolkit. I use several, organized by purpose:\n\nast-grep — Structural code search using AST patterns. Better than regex for finding code patterns that span multiple lines or have variable formatting. When I need to find all functions that return a Promise but don’t handle errors, ast-grep finds them regardless of formatting. Requires the CLI tool installed separately:\n\ndev-browser — Browser automation for testing web applications. When I say “go to localhost:3000 and click the login button,” Claude can actually do that.\n\nfrontend-design — UI/UX design assistance for frontend work. Part of the official Claude Code plugins.\n\nhookify — Creates enforcement rules from markdown files (covered in the Hooks section above). The key plugin for active convention enforcement.\n\ncommit-commands — Three git workflow commands:\n\nfeature-dev — A 7-phase structured workflow for complex features:\n\nFor complex features that touch multiple files, /feature-dev ensures nothing is missed.\n\npr-review-toolkit — Six specialized review agents that run in parallel:\n\nWhen I say “review my PR,” these agents analyze different dimensions simultaneously and return prioritized findings.\n\nPlugins are installed via the Claude Code plugin system. Official plugins require adding the Anthropic marketplace first:\n\nThe configuration in settings.json enables them:\n\nRun this to install my skills, commands, and hooks:\n\nThe script sets up ~/.claude/ and prints the plugin commands to run inside Claude Code.\n\nIf you prefer to set things up yourself:\n\nCreate ~/.claude/skills/typescript-patterns/SKILL.md with your TypeScript conventions. The filename must be SKILL.md and include frontmatter with name and description.\n\nCreate ~/.claude/commands/analyze-bug.md with your debugging workflow. Commands are invoked with /analyze-bug (the filename becomes the command name).\n\nAfter installing hookify, create enforcement rules:\n\nHooks take effect immediately—no restart required.\n\nCreate CLAUDE.md at the root of each project with project-specific instructions.\n\nMy complete configuration: github.com/stevenmays/dotfiles/tree/master/ai/claude\n\nHere’s what I didn’t expect: these customizations compound.\n\nA skill that teaches TypeScript conventions means Claude knows my preferences. A hook that enforces those conventions means Claude can’t forget them. A command that structures bug investigation means debugging follows a consistent process. A plugin that runs six review agents in parallel means PR reviews are thorough without being tedious.\n\nEach layer reinforces the others:\n\nThe time investment—maybe a few hours total—pays dividends on every subsequent session. I’m not constantly re-explaining preferences or correcting patterns. Claude already knows. And when it forgets, the hooks catch it.\n\nIt’s not that X is bad and Y is good, exactly; it’s more that default Claude Code is a capable generalist, while optimized Claude Code is a specialist who happens to share your opinions about code style, your workflow preferences, and your debugging methodology.\n\nThe choice is simple: accept defaults, work around quirks, and occasionally complain about AI-generated code that doesn’t match your style—or spend a few hours getting dialed in.",

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "fullText": "A portion of Washington State Route 410 in Pierce County between Enumclaw and Greenwater will remain closed after flood damage resulted in part of the road falling into Boise Creek, the Washington State Department of Transportation confirmed Tuesday.\n\nThe closure is from Farman Street North at milepost 25 in Enumclaw to just west of Mud Mountain Dam Road at milepost 43 in Greenwater, said WSDOT communications manager RB McKeon in an email. The road first closed Dec. 11 following heavy rain. Given the widespread damage across multiple state highways and time needed to scope repairs, WSDOT could not provide a date when the road would fully reopen, she said.\n\nRivers in Pierce and King counties may continue to flood this week as another strong weather system is expected to arrive Tuesday night, as previously reported by The News Tribune.\n\nCrews have put up a temporary emergency lane on SR 410 to reduce weight on the damaged roadway, McKeon said. The lane will “allow limited, controlled access for emergency services and local traffic only, which is being convoyed via the Greenwater Fire Department at scheduled departures throughout the day,” she said.\n\nWSDOT has been working closely with partners in Greenwater, especially the Greenwater Fire Department, to help residents navigate the area while crews assess damage and restore immediate access while simultaneously planning for longer-term repairs, McKeon said.\n\nThe Enumclaw Police Department shared a photo on its Facebook page Monday showing parts of the eastbound lane at milepost 26.6 near Boise Creek collapsing into the water. McKeon said WSDOT is working to re-establish limited, single-lane access on the westbound lane with temporary traffic signals that will alternate eastbound and westbound traffic using one lane.\n\n“Crews moved quickly to construct the temporary lane, demonstrating the urgency of the response,” McKeon said. “However, returning the highway to its pre-storm condition will require additional time and a more comprehensive repair approach.”",

    "fullText": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Like many Australians strolling at Bondi Beach on long, warm summer evenings, Ahmed al Ahmed just wanted a cup of coffee with a friend. Around him, a bloody massacre erupted as two gunmen targeted Jews during Hanukkah festivities at a park close to the shore.\n\nSoon al Ahmed was creeping, bent over, between two parked cars, before barreling directly toward one of the unsuspecting shooters. In footage that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the 44-year-old father can be seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man’s shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker.\n\nThe story of the Syrian-Australian Muslim shop owner who put an end to the rampage of one of the shooters on Sunday has been seized upon by a country desperately seeking comfort after one of its darkest hours: the slaying of 15 people as they celebrated their Jewish faith.\n\nMillions have been raised for Bondi hero\n\n“At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday, as he left a Sydney hospital where al Ahmed is being treated for gunshot wounds. “We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.”\n\nA fundraising page established by Australians who had never met al Ahmed had attracted by Tuesday night donations by some 40,000 people, who gave 2.3 million Australian dollars ($1.5 million). Among the supporters was the billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, who pledged AU$99,000.\n\nFather of two faces a long recovery\n\nAl Ahmed, who is married with two young daughters, faces a long struggle ahead, those who have spoken to him since Sunday’s massacre say. He was shot multiple times in the left arm, apparently by the second gunman in the attack as the man fired indiscriminately from a footbridge.\n\nHe has already undergone surgery and more operations are scheduled, said Lubaba alhmidi Alkahil, a spokesperson for the Australians for Syria Association, who visited al Ahmed in a hospital late Monday. The “quiet and humble” man was conscious but frail and faced at least six months of recovery, Alkahil said.\n\nA prime minister and a president are fans\n\nIn the days since the attack, a pile of floral tributes and notes of thanks has grown outside the small tobacco store al Ahmed owns opposite a train station in suburban Sydney. Meanwhile, he has received visits at the hospital from Australia’s leaders, apparently telling Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state, that he’d take the same action again.\n\nHe has been hailed as a hero by world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Australia’s Governor General, who is the representative of Britain’s King Charles in the country. Minns said al Ahmed saved “countless” lives in what the premier said was “the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen.”\n\nAl Ahmed was once a police officer\n\nAl Ahmed lived in the town of Nayrab in Syria’s Idlib region before he arrived in Australia, his cousin Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. He left Syria in 2006 after finishing his studies, before the 2011 mass protests against the government of then-President Bashar Assad that were met with a brutal crackdown and spiraled into a nearly 14-year civil war.\n\nNayrab was heavily bombed by Assad's forces with most of the town’s houses flattened and reduced to rubble. On Tuesday, al Ahmed was the talk of the town.\n\n“Ahmed did really a heroic job,” his cousin, Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. “Without any hesitation, he tackled the terrorist and disarmed him just to save innocent people.”\n\nAhmed al Ahmed's parents, who came to Sydney this year to reunite with their son, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that their son had served with the police and in the central security forces in Syria. Father Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said his son’s “conscience and soul” compelled him to act on Sunday.\n\n“I feel pride and honor because my son is a hero of Australia,” the father said.\n\nTale of heroism gives hope amid tragedy\n\nIn the aftermath of the mass killing, a country roiling from one of the worst hate-fueled attacks ever on its soil — allegedly committed by an Australian resident who arrived from India in 1998 and his Australian-born son — looked for hope amid their grief. Stories of heroism have started to emerge.\n\nThey included the tale of a married couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, who were both killed while trying to stop one of the shooters as he climbed from his car and began the massacre, their family has told Australian news outlets.\n\nReuven Morrison, 62, was also killed while trying to stop the horror, according to his daughter, Sheina Gutnick. After al Ahmed wrestled the gun from one shooter, a person Gutnick identified as Morrison is seen throwing objects at the gunman — before he was shot by the second man.\n\nActs of courage like these were cited by many on social media and in news outlets as examples of what being Australian should mean.\n\n“When he did what he did, he wasn’t thinking at all about the background of the people he’s saving, the people dying in the street,” Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said of his son. “He doesn’t discriminate between one nationality and another, especially here in Australia there’s no difference between one citizen and another.”",

    "fullText": "Long, long ago a cloud of stars circled a galaxy-size black hole, safely at a distance. Then about 200 million years ago one member of the cloud bumped another, a sun-size star, and sent it toward the black hole. The black hole was a million times more massive than the sun-size star, and its gravitational pull proportionately stronger, so the star was drawn closer and closer—until it got too close. Some of the star’s gas was pulled into an orbiting stream around the black hole that widened into a flat pancake called an accretion disk. The rest of the star came apart in a sudden and great flash of light.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, just before noon, the flash reached the 1.2-meter mirror of the Zwicky Transient Facility in southern California. Astronomers named the flash AT2019qiz and noted that they hadn’t seen it three days before. On September 25, 2019, the 10-meter Keck I telescope in Hawaii identified AT2019qiz as a so-called tidal disruption event—a flare-up that occurs when a black hole’s gravitational tides rip a small object apart. The star the size of the sun exploded with 10 billion times the sun’s luminosity.\n\nBut AT2019qiz wasn’t finished yet. An entirely unrelated star, maybe from the same cloud, was on an orbit that intersected AT2019qiz’s newly created disk. Each time this other star splashed into the disk, it flashed, though less brilliantly than the original, pulled-apart star. In December 2023 the brightness of AT2019qiz (now the name of the disrupted star, the accretion disk and the flaring star that ran into them) peaked, dimmed down and then shot up again—a pattern that repeated nine times. Each flash marked a pass of the interloper through the disk, which occurred every 48 hours. Between 2019 and 2024, astronomers observed AT2019qiz with telescopes on the ground and in space, at wavelengths from x-ray through ultraviolet, optical and infrared. The multitelescope, multiwavelength data together confirmed that AT2019qiz was first a tidal disruption event and then a “quasi-periodic eruption.” Both are examples of phenomena astronomers call transients. Both involved unspeakable violence on unearthly scales. Neither could have been identified 20 years ago.\n\n[\nTransients, which are astronomical objects that appear suddenly from nowhere and usually disappear soon after, contradict the standard truth that the universe changes predictably and slowly over billions of years. They include what the typically staid National Academy of Sciences called “the most catastrophic events in spacetime.” They are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days—which is a combination of size and speed that seems impossible. If we didn’t observe them, says astronomer Vikram Ravi of the California Institute of Technology, “you’d never know that physics allows these things to exist.”\n\nBut physics says everything not forbidden will, sooner or later and with some probability, happen. And astronomers, noticing these improbable things and knowing that nothing is one of a kind, began to find many more, all at the far reaches of physics. Between 1976 and 2012, the number of transients listed on the International Astronomical Union’s official Transient Name Server was around five each year. Between around 2013 to 2015, that number jumped to about 100. Since 2019, scientists have seen roughly 20,000 a year. At press time, the total was 175,953 transients. Chart this rise, and it looks like a long tail with an elephant attached.\n\nThe growth has been the result of a large number of astronomical surveys, most still ongoing, “vacuuming the whole sky,” says experimental physicist Christopher Stubbs of Harvard University. For instance, the Zwicky Transit Facility, which started the jump in detections in 2019, scans the entire northern sky every two nights and compares each evening’s images with the ones taken two nights before. And the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which came online in 2025, will soon survey the entire southern sky every three nights, identifying changes within 60 seconds of their detection to create near-real-time movies of the sky and finding 10 million changes every day. The elephant will go seriously nonlinear.\n\nWith such a large amount of data, astronomers can begin to study credible demographics: that is, they can move from just finding these wild, unlikely creatures to figuring out what they are. Because things that happen once and disappear are hard to study, the transients’ identities—the physics that drives them, the processes that produce them—are still speculative. Most of their names are just adjectives, and “when the transient’s name is a description,” says astrophysicist Raffaella Margutti of the University of California, Berkeley, “that tells you we know nothing intrinsic about them.” That’s about to change.\n\nScientists sort transients into two main groups: events involving the deaths of stars and events around supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies. The first known transients fell into the former category: they were supernovae, or massive stars that blow up. Before the 1600s, astronomers confidently knew of five of them; now they count tens of thousands. Supernovae fit into two general categories. One kind is the dead core of a star pulling gas from a nearby star, piling up mass until nuclear fusion restarts and goes critical and the whole thing pops off like a 20-billion-billion-billion-megaton thermonuclear bomb, which it is. It explodes in a day, stays bright for days to weeks, and fades out over months.\n\nThe other type of supernova is called a core collapse: A star burns through enough of its fuel and is massive enough that the outward push of its radiation loses to the inward pull of its gravity. Its core collapses in on itself so thoroughly that its electrons meld with the nuclei of its atoms until the star is made mostly of neutrons—a neutron star—and it shrinks in the space of one second from a radius of about 6,000 kilometers to about 10 kilometers. The collapse causes a shock wave that breaks out of the star’s remaining atmosphere with a flash called a shock breakout, and minutes later the star is as bright as 10 billion suns. It fades out over months; the remnant is called a neutron star.\n\nBeyond these two main categories, though, are many variants—the Transient Name Server identifies 31 types so far. One new kind, called a gap transient, is dimmer and probably less massive than other supernovae, and nobody knows why it explodes. Another is a superluminous supernova, twice as luminous as a core collapse supernova; it has the light of 20 billion suns, and nobody knows why it’s so bright. Supernovae are by far the most numerous of the stellar-death transients, but, as astronomer James E. Gunn of Princeton University points out, stars have “a vast number of interesting ways to die.”\n\nIn 1967, for instance, the U.S. Vela satellites detected surprising flashes of extremely energetic gamma rays that could have been (but weren’t) illegal nuclear tests in Earth’s atmosphere; the National Enquirer thought similar flashes seen later might be a space war between alien civilizations. Eventually astronomers pooled data from the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to identify the flashes, which were the first known gamma-ray bursts—a class of transients now understood to be “the brightest of the brightest,” says astrophysicist Peter Jonker of Radboud University in the Netherlands, who observes space in high-energy wavelengths. Their light rises in seconds to the brightness of a trillion suns, and they last for seconds to hours. The fastest ones might be massive stars going supernova, collapsing so thoroughly that they don’t stop at neutron stars and instead condense into star-size black holes that aim high-intensity jets of plasma at Earth.\n\nGamma-ray bursts may or may not be related to other high-energy stellar deaths called fast x-ray transients. Discovered in 2008, they number only around 70, although this tally will soon change. China’s Einstein Probe, an x-ray satellite telescope that began collecting data in mid-2025, should find 50 to 100 fast x-ray bursts a year. “The next few years could be dramatic,” says astronomer Mansi Kasliwal of Caltech. Meanwhile, because fast x-ray transients are still rare, no one is ready to say what they are—maybe massive stars exploding, maybe neutron stars colliding before disappearing into black holes.\n\nAnother dramatic rarity is called a fast optical blue transient, or FBOT—“fast” because although it explodes at the same outrageous brightness as a superluminous supernova, its light rises and falls not in months but in days. The first FBOT, found in 2018, is officially named AT2018cow and is called Cow for short. Since then, scientists have seen 12 more Cow-like FBOTs. Astronomers know they’re not supernovae—“the energy source of the normal supernovae doesn’t work” for Cows, Margutti says—but aren’t sure what they are. Maybe they flash when a nearby star’s mass piles up onto a neutron star or a modest-size black hole, or maybe they represent shock breakouts from a star that puffed up in its later years. “Whatever they are,” says astronomer Anna Y. Q. Ho of Cornell University, who helped to find the original Cow, “they’re interesting.”\n\nIn 2007 radio astronomer Duncan Lorimer and astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin, who are colleagues at West Virginia University and married, were looking in the archives of a radio telescope survey at a small galaxy 200,000 light-years away. They were interested in pulsars, which are rotating neutron stars that release jets of radio light from their magnetic poles. These lighthouselike jets sweep the sky so that whatever is in their path is exposed to a metronomically regular radio pulse every few seconds to milliseconds.\n\nIn the course of their search, Lorimer and McLaughlin found a radio spike that lasted a few milliseconds, but it didn’t pulse and was so bright it saturated the telescope’s instrument. Lorimer calculated its distance as seven billion light-years away. “Oh,” he thought, “it’s really far.” Anything that distant and still that bright had to be sending out a billion times more energy than nearby pulsars.\n\nThis odd find is now called the Lorimer Burst. Surveys have since identified several thousand of these so-called fast radio bursts scattered throughout other galaxies, emitting in one millisecond the radio energy sent out by the sun in 100 years. “These things are weird,” Lorimer says.\n\nSome of these possible stellar death transients could be related to a deeply strange object called a magnetar. Magnetars existed only in theory until they were observed in 1998. Their weirdness quotient is high even among transients. A magnetar is a neutron star that “rotates ridiculously fast,” making a full turn in milliseconds, says Daniel Kasen of the University of California, Berkeley, “but with a ridiculously high magnetic field.” The strength of the sun’s magnetic field is somewhere around 10 gauss; a magnetar’s is 1014 gauss or higher. That field is “so high it’s unstable,” Ravi says. “It chaotically reconfigures itself.”\n\nTransients are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days.\n\nThe object’s magnetic field lines twist and snap and reconnect, and in the process they send out flares. The combination of absurdly strong magnetic fields and absurdly fast rotation leads to lots of explosive physics, Kasen says. In 2004 a flare from one magnetar halfway across the Milky Way ionized the upper layers of Earth’s atmosphere. Astronomers know of around 30 of them in our galaxy so far.\n\n“Magnetars are invoked to explain a lot of things we don’t understand,” says Brian Metzger of Columbia University, a theoretical astrophysicist who specializes in stellar-death transients. For instance, different transients might be different phases of a magnetar’s life. Magnetars might be born in the core collapse of the same massive stars as superluminous supernovae. A supernova might then condense into a pulsar and send out jets that are seen as gamma-ray bursts. Later, when the magnetar’s spin period has slowed from milliseconds to seconds, its flares may be seen as a fast radio burst. Magnetars might even explain FBOTs, Ho says, but so far FBOTS are too distant for scientists to be sure.\n\nThe stellar-death transients are dying in ways intrinsic to stars. But stars can also die because they’re just in the cosmically wrong place, in the nuclei of galaxies with supermassive black holes. These “nuclear transients,” the second overall category of transients, have turned up only in the past decade. They’re rare and barely understood.\n\nOne reason for that is that nuclear transients “are a minefield of contamination,” says Suvi Gezari of the University of Maryland, College Park. Astronomers must distinguish the flashes of nuclear transients from supermassive black holes whose behavior varies. One percent of supermassive black holes, the quasars, are furiously, actively accreting gas and shine so brightly they can be seen near the beginning of the universe. Most of the rest are inactive and just flickering; they have gravitationally cleared out much of the space around them, and their brightness varies by just 10 to 45 percent. And another, unknown fraction are not accreting at all; they’re completely black and invisible.\n\nNuclear transients are not active quasars, and they don’t flicker—they’re cosmic flash-bangs. One kind is a tidal disruption event such as AT2019qiz, a star trapped in a supermassive black hole’s gravitational field and torn to smithereens. Astronomers have found around 100 tidal disruption events, each visible for a few months in the x-ray, optical and ultraviolet ranges, each with its own small accretion disk that lasts for a few tens of years. Maybe one in 10 tidal disruption events do what AT2019qiz did and become the site of another kind of nuclear transient, the quasi-periodic eruption. In these cases, an errant star passes through the tidally disrupted star’s accretion disk and flares up in x-rays to the brightness of a billion suns. Such flares last minutes and repeat in hours to weeks.\n\nOther nuclear transients may not involve stars at all and may reflect odd behavior of the black holes. One kind of transient discovered in the past decade is called a changing-look quasar (CLQ). It has the brightness of a normal quasar but rapidly changes its appearance in unexplainable ways. It should take thousands of years for a quasar to switch off and go from brilliantly active to quietly inactive. Yet astronomers have found dozens to hundreds of CLQs that change their looks by 200 percent in months—they change so much and so quickly that “they’re not theoretically explainable,” says astrophysicist Paul Green of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Maybe they’re the aftermath of a long-gone tidal disruption event, or maybe, he says, “we haven’t watched long enough to see a change of state that’s lasting.”\n\nAs if CLQs weren’t improbable enough, astronomers also find ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), whose problem is in their name: “They’re ambiguous,” says astrophysicist Philip Wiseman, who studies nuclear transients at the University of Southampton in England. They are a diagnosis of exclusion, a flash that isn’t any other transient. ANTs are brighter than all transients except gamma-ray bursts. Their light rises slowly over months and lasts for two or more years. They’ve been found in data archives in numbers from a few to hundreds, depending on who’s defining them. “We can find them, but we don’t know what they are,” says astronomer Matthew Graham of Caltech, another nuclear-transients specialist.\n\nThese events are flashes of inconceivable amounts of energy.\n\nOne ANT discovered in 2020 became famous: At first astronomers thought it was an actively feeding supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy, but they couldn’t find the galaxy. The lonely supermassive black hole, like a kind of negative island, is somewhere between 10 and 1,000 times the size of the one in the Milky Way. One of its names is ZTF20abrbeie; astronomers call it Scary Barbie.\n\nANTs could be outsize tidal disruption events—that is, instead of sun-size stars being torn apart by black holes with the mass of a million suns, they might be 10-solar-mass stars torn apart by black holes with the mass of a billion suns. Or they could be supermassive black holes moving from inactive flickering to active fiery accretion—black holes “turning on,” Graham says. Researchers are still looking for Scary Barbie’s galaxy. “We’re guessing at half this stuff,” Graham adds.\n\nThe obvious question is, Are some of these transients somehow aspects of the same thing? For stellar-death transients, the answer is not exactly no. Several of them may be related to one another or to magnetars; in general, they’re a menu of the variables that determine how stars end their lives. For nuclear transients, the answer is unsatisfying: either a captured star or a black hole’s accretion disk is brightening. For a better answer, astronomers need to collect many more nuclear transients.\n\nNor can stellar and nuclear transients be put together into a single grand unified theory. Such a picture should be based on their physics—specifically, the source of energy for their outbursts. “The holy grail is understanding what produced the transient,” says Eliot Quataert of Princeton, a theoretical astrophysicist studying nuclear transients. Theorists want to be able to slot energy sources into a few categories, such as radioactive decay, shocks and gravity, although some transients don’t seem to fit into any of these boxes.\n\nTo figure out the energy sources and maybe unify transients, astronomers need to compare what they see in different wavelengths, which each reflect different physical processes. In supernovae, for instance, ultraviolet light comes from shock breakouts, and x-rays and radio waves come from collisions between matter ejected in the explosion and the surrounding gas. Collecting every possible photon from every physical process allows astronomers to assemble a complete picture of the event.\n\nAccordingly, telescopes now operating in optical, ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma-ray and radio-wave bands are about to be joined by a series of new telescopes in space. Among them are NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will launch by mid-2027 and observe in the infrared; the Einstein Probe in x-ray; and NASA’s Ultraviolet Explorer, which will launch in 2030.\n\nYou might wonder whether this is a lot of telescopes and effort just to learn about 100,000 one-offs in a universe full of 10,000 billion billion stars in 100 billion galaxies. Understanding transients is important partly for answering other astronomical questions. Supernovae are used as distance markers to enable calculations of the universe’s acceleration. Both tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions hold evidence about supermassive black holes that are quiescent and therefore invisible, as well as about the all but theoretical class of black holes whose masses are between those of stellar black holes and supermassive ones. And fast radio bursts, because they are visible in the distant universe, can be used as searchlights to map the distribution of regular matter, of which only 10 percent is known.\n\nBut transients are also interesting for their own odd selves, for their ability to teach us what physics doesn’t forbid. Kasen says they are “laboratories for fundamental physics and extreme conditions”; they are “physics at the extreme,” Margutti says, “and I can’t probe that on Earth.” Transients show “the range of phenomena possible in the universe,” Ravi says.\n\nThese events are flashes of inconceivable amounts of energy released in the time it takes to buy groceries, drink a glass of water or snap your fingers. A supernova shock breakout travels the distance from Baltimore to Western Australia in half an eyeblink. A magnetar passing 160,000 kilometers away could demagnetize every credit card on Earth. A neutron star compresses a massive star to the length of a leisurely two-hour walk. The study of transients is certifiable science, but if it weren’t, it would still be reason for near-holy astonishment.",

    "fullText": "34-year-old Nikesh Mistry from Milton Keynes has been sentenced to nearly five years in prison for his aggressive actions, which led to a motorcyclist being thrown off a bridge. The incident, characterized by authorities as \"extreme\" road rage, occurred on November 19, 2022, near the Walton Roundabout in Milton Keynes.\n\nMistry, driving a silver BMW, engaged in a dangerous altercation with a motorcyclist, a man in his 40s, following what police described as a \"non-verbal exchange.\" The situation quickly escalated as Mistry attempted to force the motorcyclist off the road by swerving towards him. In a bid to avoid a collision, both parties ended up on the wrong side of the road.\n\nWARNING! This video is graphic and can be disturbing to some viewers!\n\nThe confrontation reached a critical point when Mistry trapped the motorcyclist between his vehicle and a metal barrier, causing a collision with an oncoming car. The impact sent the motorcyclist flying off the bridge and into the undergrowth below, resulting in serious injuries. He was subsequently airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for urgent medical attention. Additionally, the front seat passenger of the car involved in the collision also sustained serious injuries and required hospitalization.\n\nCaptured on shocking video footage, the collision and the subsequent airborne trajectory of the motorcyclist highlighted the severe consequences of Mistry's actions. In December of the same year, Mistry pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Aylesbury Crown Court handed down a sentence of four years and 10 months in prison. Furthermore, Mistry received a driving disqualification for the same duration and will be required to pass an extended re-test before he can regain his driving license.\n\nPC Phil McGlue of the Roads Policing Unit, the investigating officer, stated, \"This case is an extreme example of road rage.\" He emphasized that Mistry's decision to respond with disproportionate violence turned a road disagreement into a grave assault. \"Drivers who behave in such a manner will be rigorously investigated and held to account for their actions,\" McGlue added, underlining the consequences of such reckless behavior on public roads.",

    "title": "Aftermath Of Ukraine’s Underwater Drone Attack On Russian Submarine Seen In Satellite Imagery",
    "description": "Ukraine's submersible drone navigated into a protected harbor and detonated very close to the targeted submarine.",
    "fullText": "Satellite imagery is now available showing the aftermath of a Ukrainian attack yesterday on a Russian Navy Improved Kilo class diesel-electric submarine in the Black Sea naval stronghold of Novorossiysk. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed that this was the first attack against a Russian vessel using an uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV). The operation could also mark the historic first successful use of a UUV as an anti-ship weapon, but the actual level of damage inflicted on the submarine remains unclear. Readers can first get up to date on the attack in our initial reporting here.\n\nTWZ obtained satellite images of where the attack occurred in Novorossiysk from Vantor (formerly Maxar Technologies). Additional imagery from Planet Labs has also been circulating online.\n\nThe satellite imagery confirms that the UUV — named by the SBU as a Sub Sea Baby, a previously unknown type — detonated off the stern of the submarine, which was at a pier in the port of Novorossiysk. A substantial chunk of the pier itself was destroyed in the attack. This all aligns with video footage shot during the attack from a position on the ground nearby, which the SBU released yesterday.\n\nСБУ вразила підводний човен рф у Новоросійську\n\nДеталі за посиланням\n\nhttps://t.co/2PjfguPVnMpic.twitter.com/pU2LIr7DP0\n\n— СБ України (@ServiceSsu) December 15, 2025\n\nThe post-strike imagery shows that the Improved Kilo class submarine, also known as a Project 636.3 Varshavyanka class type, is in the same position as it was before the attack. Two other submarines that were moored nearby when the attack occured have moved. Other submarines and ships are still in the moorings, including on the outside edge of the damaged pier.\n\nSome of the imagery available now suggests that the submarine that was attacked may now be sitting lower in the water, but that can’t be readily confirmed. Any damage below the waterline would also not be visible in the images. At the same time, there are also no clear signs of any emergency measures having been taken to keep it afloat, or to contain the leakage of oil or other potentially hazardous fluids, as one might expect to see if the damage was severe.\n\nBased on the estimated length of what is visible of the submarine, some observers have noted that the epicenter of the explosion looks to have been less than 65 feet from the stern. The size and configuration of the Sub Sea Baby’s warhead, as well as other details about the UUV and its capabilities, remain scant.\n\nSatellite imagery shows the aftermath of a strike by a Sea Baby underwater drone against a submarine pier in the port of Novorossiysk.\n\nAccording to the image, the strike occurred approximately 20 meters from the stern of a Project 636 Varshavyanka-class submarine, which remains… https://t.co/SVecegvkeD pic.twitter.com/fxOicR5AAW\n\n— OSINTWarfare (@OSINTWarfare) December 16, 2025\n\nTo note, the stern section of Kilo-class submarine remains submerged so presumably it was even closer than 20 meters.\n\nHighly probable that at least the propelled end got affected in a kinetic way.\n\n(satellite imagery I've used is not recent and used for illustration purposes… https://t.co/fwO0UldAZs pic.twitter.com/qxNHs2AEQf\n\n— Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) December 16, 2025\n\nIt’s also worth noting that wider views of the port of Novorossiysk following the attack show four Project 636 submarines still present. There is nothing definitive to indicate that the targeted boat might have been replaced by another to conceal the extent of the damage.\n\nSatellite reveals that four Kilo-class submarines are docked at the Novorossisk port in Russia. One of them appears to have a slightly different waterline compared to the other three. Ukraine claimed that its underwater UV launched an attack on the area via Mizarvision #OSINT pic.twitter.com/k1DLtOcloL\n\n— GEOINT (@lobsterlarryliu) December 16, 2025\n\nFor its part, the Russian Ministry of Defense had unsurprisingly denied that any damage was inflicted on the submarine or to any personnel at the port. The ministry has released a video that it claims shows the undamaged boat, but does not offer a view of the stern end. The background is also heavily censored. Even so, it does still reveal what looks like piles of broken concrete debris left on the pier after the explosion, which was clearly visible in the SBU’s video of the attack, as well as in the satellite imagery available now.\n\nRussia shows footage of a Project 636.3 Improved Kilo-class submarine docked in the Novorossiysk Naval Base to deny Ukraine's claims about successful attack with an unmmaned underwater vehicle (UUV) on it. https://t.co/8molL3Fc2y pic.twitter.com/tECFkjknkM\n\n— Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) December 16, 2025\n\nIt looks like there are piles of concrete debris left on the pier after the explosion. pic.twitter.com/h2NvDi0jkC\n\n— Capt(N) (@Capt_Navy) December 16, 2025\n\nThe press service of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which operates the submarine, also denies any damage to its vessels. This is also consistent with reports from various Russian naval monitoring channels on social media, but clear corroborating evidence has yet to emerge.\n\nOverall, at this stage, we still cannot say with any authority what degree of damage, if any, the submarine may have actually sustained.\n\nOn the other hand, the attack does show Ukraine was at least able to slip a UUV into a heavily defended harbor, in daylight, and detonate its warhead only a few dozen or so feet away from a prized Russian submarine worth, according to the SBU, around $400 million.\n\nAt least one Ukrainian UUV was therefore notably able to penetrate past barriers erected at the mouth of the port, intended specifically to protect the vessels within. It’s worth noting, however, that the defensive barriers Russia has already built around ports were primarily put there in response to Ukraine’s uncrewed surface vessel (USV) campaign. This underscores the significance of the use of a UUV in this attack, as another example of the steady adaptation of weapons systems and tactics in response to countermeasures that has become a particular hallmark of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nWith that in mind, Russia is likely to introduce new countermeasures against this particular mode of attack, one which Ukraine has spent some time developing.\n\nThe results of yesterday’s attack, while inconclusive for now, will likely spur further such developments in Ukraine, as well. Before SBU targeted the submarine in Novorossiysk, Ukraine had unveiled a UUV dubbed Marichka, designed to launch kamikaze attacks against ships and maritime infrastructure. At least one other Ukrainian UUV, known as Toloka, has previously been disclosed. It’s unclear if either of these has any relationship to the Sub Sea Baby.\n\nFurthermore, the attack confirms that the Black Sea Fleet is very much still a prime target for Ukraine. This applies especially to the submarines like the Project 636 types and corvettes that are able to launch Kalibr long-range cruise missiles. These weapons have been regularly used in Russia’s nightly barrages launched against targets across Ukraine.\n\nAlready, Ukrainian naval actions had forced the Black Sea Fleet to retreat from bases on the occupied Crimean Peninsula to Novorossiysk. Attacks in Crimea were also prosecuted against another Improved Kilo class submarine. In September 2023, the Rostov-on-Don was severely damaged during a combined missile and USV attack on Sevastopol. Ukraine later claimed it was destroyed.\n\nAt the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Black Sea Fleet had a total of six Project 636 submarines available.\n\nOther navies around the world will likely have watched yesterday’s attack with interest.\n\nAs well as the United States, China and many other nations are developing their own UUVs for missions like this one.\n\nUUVs are able to attack vessels and other targets at long distances and can be launched from submarines and motherships, further extending their range. They can also be used for surveillance and mine laying, among other duties. You can read more about these vessels in various TWZ stories here.\n\nUltimately, whether or not the Russian submarine was damaged, the attack has demonstrated once again that the war in Ukraine is a crucible for the development of new military technologies, especially uncrewed ones.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with a key piece of technology called an engine immobilizer and pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.\n\nThe settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.\n\nThefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because beginning in 2021, videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable. Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022. Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.\n\nEllison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.\n\n“This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,” Ellison said at a news conference.\n\nHe was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents’ vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times — as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.\n\nUnder the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.\n\nEligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.\n\nIn separate statements, the automakers said the agreement is one of multiple anti-theft efforts they have taken to help customers.\n\n“Kia is eager to continue working with law enforcement officers and officials at federal, state, and local levels to combat criminal car theft, and the role social media has played in encouraging it, and we remain fully committed to upholding vehicle security,” the company said.\n\nHyundai said, “We will continue to take meaningful action to support our customers and ensure peace of mind.”\n\nDura reported from Bismarck, North Dakota.",

    "description": "Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday responded to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles calling him a conspiracy theorist in a recent Vanity Fair story.",
    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday responded to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles calling him a “conspiracy theorist” in an explosive new Vanity Fair story.\n\nThe political world was rocked by Wiles’s explosive tell-all with the outlet. In it, she referred to Office of Budget and Management Director Russell Vought as a “right-wing absolute zealot,” claimed that President Donald Trump had “an alcoholic’s personality,” and even denied Trump’s previous claims that former President Bill Clinton visited Jeffrey Epstein’s private island.\n\nWiles also called Vance’s support for Trump “sort of political,” and added that the vice president had been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade.”\n\nHours after the story went live, Vance was at an event in Pennsylvania to speak about the economy. When it was opened up to questions, Vance was asked for his thoughts on Wiles’s characterization of him. The vice president said:\n\nI haven’t looked at the article. I, of course, have heard about it. But, conspiracy theorist — sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true. And, by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time.\n\nFor example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask 3-year-olds at the height of the Covid pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. You know, I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job. And I believed in the conspiracy theory that Joe Biden was trying to throw his political opponents in jail rather than win an argument against his political opponents.\n\nSo, at least on some of these conspiracy theories, it turns out that a conspiracy theory is just something that was true six months before the media admitted it, and that’s my understanding.\n\nQ: Susie Wiles referred to you as a \"conspiracy theorist\" and your transformation into a Trump supporter as \"an act of political expediency.\" Your response?\n\nJD VANCE: Sometimes I am in conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true pic.twitter.com/ySghDjMgDz\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nAlthough Vance downplayed the article, he later suggested the White House will make themselves less accessible to mainstream media outlets because of it.\n\n“And the last thing I’ll say is if any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article,” Vance continued, “I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews mainstream media outlets.”\n\nJD Vance: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope it's that we should be giving fewer interview to mainstream media outlets\" pic.twitter.com/6d8LoEIXWD\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nHe also reaffirmed his support for Wiles, stating that he had never seen her be disloyal to the president.\n\nVANCE: I've seen so many people who will say one thing to the president's face and then will do the exact opposite behind the scenes–\n\nGUY IN CROWD: They're traitors!\n\nVANCE: They are.

    "description": "The president said he is weighing an executive order on the issue.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reiterated that he is “very strongly” weighing an executive order that would reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said he is looking into the move, adding that “a lot of people want to see” it happen.\n\n“It leads to tremendous amounts of research that can’t be done unless you reclassify,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “So, we are looking at that very strongly.”\n\nMarijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I substance, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The classification puts the drug on the same level as heroin, LSD and ecstasy.\n\nSeveral outlets reported that the White House is weighing whether to list marijuana instead as Schedule III, which is defined as “drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.” Examples include Tylenol mixed with codeine, ketamine and testosterone.\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll from October 2024, 69% of registered voters back reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug category, including 51% of Trump supporters and 86% of supporters of former Vice President Kamala Harris. A Morning Consult poll from August found that roughly three in five voters, or 61%, support reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug under federal law.\n\nTrump’s statement follows his broad declaration of support for changing federal policy on the drug while on the 2024 campaign trail. Two months before the election, he said he intended to vote in favor of an amendment that would legalize marijuana for recreational use in his home state of Florida.\n\n“As I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product.”\n\nFormer President Joe Biden’s administration also proposed moving the drug to the Schedule III category, though it did not come to fruition by the end of his term. Last year, the Justice Department recommended shifting cannabis to Schedule III, which prompted a formal review by the DEA.\n\nTrump’s announcement drew reactions from both sides of the political aisle.\n\n“Praying that somehow President Trump does not go forward with [this],” Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham wrote on X on Tuesday.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) told NewsNation on Monday that “I think rescheduling marijuana is wrong.”\n\n“The fact is, marijuana is a gateway drug,” Lawler said. “Most of the people who end up using hard substances start out on marijuana.”\n\nWhile Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) previously urged Trump to loosen restrictions on marijuana, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said that the president “will try to gaslight everyone into believing he just made pot legal.”\n\n“He has not decriminalized cannabis or expunged the records of black and Latino Americans stuck in prison for minor drug offenses,” Wyden wrote on X. “This is just an attempt to boost his pathetic approval ratings.”\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump met privately last week with marijuana industry executives, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mehmet Oz, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to discuss a plan on relaxing some federal restrictions on the drug. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) joined via a phone call, the outlet first reported.",

    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nEditor’s Note: This is one of Popular Mechanics’ greatest stories. It was initially published in March 2022.\n\nWe climb in the humid afternoon up a rutted and overgrown logging road, the sky mostly sealed off by a canopy of tree branches, sunlight leaking through dense greenery in elongated shafts. The hike up Dents Run is not quite a half mile long, but the six representatives of Finders Keepers LLC, a Pennsylvania-based treasure-hunting business, string out as climbers on Everest. Co-owner Denny Parada, 69, brings up the rear, hobbling a bit and breathing forcefully. He’s wearing a Finders Keepers polo and a camo baseball cap and shorts and has a handgun strapped to his hip. “Snakes,” he’d explained.\n\nDents Run is an unincorporated community in Benezette Township in rural Elk County, in northwestern Pennsylvania. We’re on a wooded slope, one knobby vertebra among thousands along the spine of the Appalachians. The overgrown road we’re ascending, known locally as Snooks Trail, is a lingering scar from a decades-old logging operation, though most recently it has served as the access point to Parada’s lifelong obsession.\n\nAbout halfway up, Denny’s 37-year-old son and business partner, Kem, hollers and points. An elk is perched on a steep slope above the trail, 50 feet up. It stands unmoving, staring us down, as the group stops to gaze back. A few of us snap photos and turn uphill; the elk stays locked on us as we trudge away.\n\nAnyone who is inclined to anthropomorphize might infer some type of omen in this. Dents Run has an enigmatic history—a lump of new-growth forest that’s unremarkable in every way, except that it birthed a tale of, among other things, a psychic, a cache of buried gold, Confederate sympathizers, an army of FBI agents, and a furtive overnight dig.\n\nOnce we reach our destination, Parada points to the slender cave opening that first propelled his quest, and the location maybe 15 yards away where four years ago the FBI authorized a sizable excavation. Parada is a paunchy nub of a man with a gray mustache and goatee. He uses an early-aughts-style flip phone and chews tobacco. His recitations of his exploits blend boyish wonder with the copious f-bombs of a case-hardened cynic. At the moment, he’s describing the extensive testing he did on this very ground to confirm the presence of gold.\n\n“I just think beyond any other treasure hunters,” he says, “because… I’m not going to claim I’m smart, but I do more experiments than anybody.”\n\nAs he speaks, Dwayne Kelly, a member of Parada’s entourage of full-timers, part-timers, and volunteers, is circling a nearby slope with dowsing rods. Parada describes Kelly as a kind of savant with this ancient if scientifically debunked method of searching for underground metal.\n\n“I need everybody’s opinion here,” Kelly says. The rest of the group clusters around him.\n\n“He’s finding something,” Denny notes, but then continues with his recounting of events from years earlier. Before he gets much further, Warren Getler splits away and joins us. Getler is the group’s default scholar, an expert in geophysics and buried Civil War treasure. “We think there’s something going on,” he says. “Look at the similarity to this up there. And look, the potential tunnel right there. We’re getting a strong signal.”\n\nThey begin scanning the site with a Discovery Treasure-Finder 900, a metal detector capable of locating objects as deep as 12 feet underground. Denny ejects a wad of Skoal-tinted saliva. “Dwayne, what did you do?” he shouts in mock exasperation, holding his arms wide.\n\n“I’m making you rich, buddy,” Kelly calls back.\n\n“He does this constantly to me,” Parada says.\n\nLater, he says, grinning, “You’re actually on a treasure hunt. I didn’t expect this to happen.”\n\nIt’s maybe the most surprising thing he’s said all day. This is Parada’s stock in trade, after all, and his adventures on Dents Run have gained traction in newspapers and on television worldwide. But treasure hunting is the longest of long games, and whether Kelly has actually found anything will not be determined today—or, most likely, anytime soon.\n\nAs with just about everything Parada gets involved with, the answers are tantalizingly close—just a few feet below ground—but just out of reach.\n\nThe drama at Dents Run started, as these stories do, with a fortuitous meeting. It was March 1974. Denny Parada, a native of nearby Philipsburg and a recent graduate of commercial-art school, had taken a job at a W.T. Grant department store, but his passions lay elsewhere. His grandmother was an antiques dealer, and he was fascinated with old objects, including a mysterious river stone he’d found as a child and kept. He thought it might be a Native American artifact. “I always loved this kind of stuff—historical stuff,” he says.\n\nIn his 20s, Parada bought treasure-hunting magazines and, during idle weekend hours, began sleuthing the mysteries they posed. One article in particular caught his attention because it was fascinating, and it was local: the legend of Dents Run gold.\n\nThe story has tentacled off in various ways over generations of retellings, and details have been added or amended over time. But the essence of the saga, as recounted in a 2019 Mt. Zion Historical Society booklet, remains the same. In 1863, the U.S. government’s War Department authorized a shipment of 50-pound gold bars—26 in all—from San Francisco to the Philadelphia Mint to finance the war effort. To avoid Confederate activity, the supply wagons carrying the gold were diverted from a route across southern Pennsylvania into the hilly, forested north. Following the advice of a local guide, the commander, Lt. James Castleton, and his sergeant, Mike O’Rourke, attempted a shortcut over the mountains using an 1842 map titled “Wildcat Country.”\n\nThings quickly went sideways. The logging road they were on led to a trail junction that wasn’t shown on the map. They picked the most promising option, but that petered out, leaving them to navigate a wilderness of tall virgin pines. Eventually they encountered a steep hillside that the wagons couldn’t navigate. The decision was made to send for help, pack out as much gold as possible, and bury the rest.\n\nMost of the men went missing, and the gold never arrived in Philadelphia. Pinkerton detectives who were dispatched to investigate never recovered the cache (although they did find two and a half bars). The National Archives holds no record of the shipment, but the legend of the lost gold “has captivated the attention of thousands of people over the past 150 years,” the historical society reports. And waves of fresh ambition, fortified by the forward march of metal-detecting technology, have continually fueled new searches.\n\nDennis Parada was just another dreaming amateur in 1974 when his employer hired Michael Malley—who performed at the time as the psychic Professor M.G. Malley—to present a “delightfully entertaining ESP presentation.” Parada missed the presentation during his shift in the furniture department. He thought the notion of a psychic was ridiculous anyway.\n\nHe was on his lunch break when Malley wandered by. Parada brandished a copy of Treasure Magazine with the Dents Run story, so one of his colleagues asked Malley whether he could help locate the gold. “What I’m about to tell you next,” Parada says of this encounter, would “change our lives forever.”\n\nMalley ran a finger over the article while Parada stood behind him thinking, What a bunch of bullshit. But Malley then went into a trance and began speaking in voices—Parada believes they were soldiers who’d lost the fateful gold shipment. Malley picked up the atlas Parada had with him, and with eyes looking toward the ceiling, brought a pen down on a spot where he instructed Parada to go. Later, using a soil sample Parada had collected, Malley told him to look for a cave entrance.\n\nParada became a believer, but the search ran aground when he was unable to locate the cave. He became preoccupied with life—opening several businesses, including an antique-furniture store, and raising a family. But he never forgot Dents Run; Kem, born in 1985, grew up hearing bedtime stories about that gold.\n\nFast-forward 30 years. It’s 2004, and Denny is sitting in a bar watching TV with a friend, Scott Farrell. The show is about treasure hunting, and it reminds him of Dents Run. Farrell asks Parada whether he wants to take another look. Soon afterward, they hike up the hill and Parada waves in the direction of the purported cave. Before he gets far looking further uphill, Farrell yells that he found something. “Don’t joke with me, Scott,” Denny calls back.\n\nBut Farrell (who has since died) had found it: a horizontal slit of an entrance on the slope below the logging road, just wide enough for a person to crawl in. Parada surmises that work crews had inadvertently sealed over the entrance when constructing the road, and erosion over subsequent decades had opened it back up. A trickle of water leaked from the opening.\n\nInside the grotto, Parada says, they found a hand-built wall of stacked stones. Their flashlight beams played over scorch marks on the ceiling, apparently from a torch. They later discovered Civil War-era bullets and other artifacts nearby, adding to their suspicion that troops had visited the site during the conflict.\n\nMalley had advised them that the cave was 32 feet deep. The stacked-stone wall was at 15 feet, but later Kem Parada was able to remove enough stones to find a second chamber behind it—and that one was also 15 feet deep. At the back of that chamber they located a shaft, but further excavation posed too much of a cave-in risk, so they backed off. The cave was muddy and damp—a claustrophobe’s nightmare—but the Paradas were exultant, feeling they were close to finding something, possibly the mythical cache of gold. Focusing on the ground above, they investigated further using a metal-detecting device called a GPL 200. (GPL stands for “ground penetrating locator.”) The user embeds stakes connected by wire around a plot of ground. By pulsing electrical current through the stakes, the device gauges the presence of metals and minerals below, based on how strongly the underground elements oppose—or “resist,” in geophysical terms—the charge. Gold, silver, and copper are highly conductive, so the lower the resistivity reading, the higher the odds that they’ve been discovered.\n\nThe Paradas’ GPL revealed a highly conductive metal mass just off to one side of the underground chamber. They also tested the site using ground-penetrating radar. That device emits radio frequencies into the earth’s surface, which then either bounce back or are absorbed, depending on what they encounter. To estimate what lies beneath, the device’s computer calculates the signal strength of the reflected radio waves and the amount of time they took to bounce back.\n\nIn 2010, the Paradas hired Terence Hamill, founder and chief geophysicist of GeoSearches Inc., an Ohio-based firm specializing in subsurface geophysical surveys. Hamill detected “a large metallic anomaly at depth, differentiated from the surrounding geology,” reinforcing Parada’s suspicion that something was there. “We could see that there was something completely different down there, and it could well be precious,” Hamill says.\n\nOver the next nine years, Denny and Kem Parada visited Dents Run about 300 times, capturing more than 100 readings. Kem says the results were unmistakable: “It all screamed gold at this same location.”\n\nWhen they’d first found the cave entrance, the Paradas had been hobbyists—guys out hunting for treasure on weekends and during their spare hours. The site is on state land overseen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and DCNR officials initially seemed unfazed by their activities, signing off on everything they asked to do short of sinking shovels into earth. “They kind of just let us do our thing,” Kem says.\n\nEventually the Paradas became such a regular presence at Dents Run that state officials sent them a letter identifying them as professional treasure hunters. The Paradas embraced the classification by forming Finders Keepers.\n\nBolstered by this veneer of legitimacy, they began to more intensively explore the question of whether they had actually struck gold. They secured permission from the DCNR to drill bore holes from above with non-commercial-grade equipment. “We basically spent years Swiss-cheesing this mountaintop,” Kem says.\n\nAs they drilled their 16th hole, the bit stopped about five and a half feet down. This was odd, because they were typically exploring as far as 12 feet down. They switched out their three-quarter-inch masonry drill bit for a one-inch bit, and Denny switched the machine onto high speed and put all his weight into it. The bit sent up a squealing sound—metal on metal, he says—and stopped dead. He shut the drill down to let it cool, but when he returned after lunch, the bit was so firmly wedged into something that it took two and a half days to extract it.\n\nWhen he finally retrieved the bit, yellowish smears were melted onto the end—a “gold shine,” as he puts it, though there was no way to test for it. At this point anyone would be sorely tempted to just start shoveling earth, but they were committed to doing things by the book. On November 1, 2010, Denny asked the DCNR for permission to drill a two-inch hole into the location and drop a camera inside. This time the answer was no. An official said they needed “to see gold metal on a drill bit in sufficient quantity to convince us” that such invasive procedures were warranted.\n\nThat was when things started to get weird. They’d been leaving their equipment at the site—including a generator and metal detectors—but someone began taking pieces of gear, including trail cameras hanging from trees, GPL stakes, and an extension cord. But the thieves missed one camera, and the images from it stunned Parada: The people removing his equipment were uniformed DCNR personnel. Parada demanded that his gear be returned, and over the course of several heated exchanges, his relationship with the state agency became adversarial. Parada even found evidence that he believes shows that people attached to the agency conducted their own dig on the site, though not in the place he had identified as holding the cache.\n\nThis escalation brought steep consequences. In 2014, the DCNR sent a certified letter demanding that the Paradas cease all activity there. “Once we drove down and hit the gold and had them on site, that’s when things changed,” Denny says. “It’s just big government bureaucratic stuff that pisses me off.”\n\nThat summer, the Paradas took a meeting with a staff member of the Pennsylvania legislature who offered to facilitate a dig permit. The person (whom the Paradas decline to name) claimed to be acting on behalf of individuals in state government—someone who controlled money going to DCNR, and someone working in the governor’s office. But there was a condition: The Paradas had to kick back three gold bars, or 12 percent of the haul, Denny says. He captured the incident on video, and the Paradas’ attorney, Bill Cluck, reported the incident to the FBI, but no one was ever charged.\n\nFrustrated and stymied by the DCNR ban, the Paradas turned to other projects. More than four years passed, and they might have eventually forsaken Dents Run. But then, in November 2017, Denny’s phone rang.\n\nWarren Getler had come across the Paradas’ Dents Run adventure on a treasure-hunting online bulletin board. He was instantly intrigued. Getler had worked as a journalist for the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News, among other outlets, and had coauthored a book, Rebel Gold, about the Knights of the Golden Circle. The KGC, he told Denny, was a quasi-military secret society that took hold in the South and Midwest during the Civil War. Its founders opposed the abolitionist movement and sought to create a new slave-owning nation that encompassed the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean as a counterweight to the North. Operatives looted Union shipments to raise money for the cause, and then stashed plundered gold and silver in various locations around the country. Getler says many of those caches remain intact today—and he told Parada he believed the Dents Run gold was stolen by a KGC-affiliated group in the North called the Copperheads.\n\nGetler opined that while there was likely gold at Dents Run, the fable associated with its presence there is apocryphal. The gold was likely stolen and hidden there, he said, and the story of the lost supply wagons is, in part, a KGC “waybill”—a cryptic, coded message meant to indicate the location of a cache to insiders.\n\nThe Getler-Parada alliance formed with the suddenness and intensity of a thunderclap. They talked nearly every night for the next two months, and came to a powerful realization: Getler’s narrative gave them another avenue for pursuing the treasure. If the gold bars had come from the U.S. Mint, they were federal property. And the Feds could invoke eminent domain in order to dig on state land.\n\nGetler eventually left journalism to join a tech startup that focused on geophysics and subsurface target detection in Washington, D.C. He knew that the electrical-resistivity-sensing equipment Denny was using had certain limitations because the Dents Run soil contained high clay and water content. But the possibilities were compelling—so much so that he offered to arrange a meeting with the FBI to explore a possible gold recovery at the Pennsylvania site.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, the Paradas met Getler in Philadelphia. They ate slices of pizza together, then headed to the U.S. Attorney’s office, where they met two agents from the bureau’s Art Crime Team and an assistant U.S. attorney. The agents spent an hour listening and looking over the Paradas’ stuff. They were initially skeptical, Denny says, “but when I showed them what I had”—including various instrument readings—“they were more convinced.” Getler provided a colloquium on the KGC.\n\nWhen they’d finished, Special Agent Jake Archer told them, “I just want to be clear. If the gold is there, it’s ours. We are going to seize it.”\n\nDenny answered that he would request a finder’s fee, and Archer didn’t object. The agent also indicated that the three men could be on site if the government decided to dig. The next day, Archer called looking for directions, and the Paradas provided detailed GPS coordinates.\n\nOn January 31, the Paradas and Getler met a contingent of seven FBI agents led by Archer at a restaurant near Dents Run. Heading there, Kem noticed an unmarked SUV that appeared to be a law enforcement vehicle following them. He’d been a cop for nine years and knew everyone in the area, and he didn’t recognize it. “It was creepy,” he says.\n\nThe Paradas led the contingent up snow-draped Dents Run, where they generated readings from their GPL 200. They reproduced the test away from the target site, to show the contrast in readings. The agents conducted their own examination using a TF-900 metal detector, and then talked about what kind of earth-moving equipment would be necessary for an excavation.\n\nHicks Run Road, which provides access to the site, is a sparsely populated dirt lane. Garrett Osche lives closest to the site, on a property at the base of the mountain called Pine Valley Camp, which his family has owned for more than 80 years. Osche has tousled gray hair and piercing blue eyes and wore a camouflage shirt with cutoff sleeves. Over the years he’d become friendly with the Paradas, so he allowed the agents to park and change their clothes in his heated garage. When they came down the hill that day, they seemed excited. “They were chirping like a bunch of chickens,” Osche says. Archer, aware of Osche’s presence, shut them down, saying, “We’ll talk about this at the office.”\n\nGetler encouraged Archer to dive deeper into the science of underground detection before planning a dig. He suggested handheld EM-31 and GEM-2 units; these electromagnetic devices have been deployed by the U.S. military in Iraq to locate IEDs and tunnels. The other choice, even more ideal, was a gravimeter—a heavy, boxlike system that calculates the size, weight, and mass of underground objects. It works by comparing an object’s density to the soil in which it sits, and then feeding the data into a software algorithm that spits out analyses in the form of heat maps. The device shows clear contrasts between precious metals and regular soil. Gold, for example, would score a density reading of 18 or 19, whereas sedimentary rock would measure around 2.3. “You can get a pretty accurate depth reading to the center of an object,” Getler says. “It’s very accurate and very sensitive.”\n\nGetler recommended several geophysics companies that could conduct tests, and the bureau chose Enviroscan Inc., a respected firm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with more than 25 years in business, to conduct a gravimeter survey. Enviroscan’s principal geophysicist was Dr. Tim Bechtel, who in 2020 would be awarded the prestigious Public Service Award by the Geological Society of America. Four FBI agents returned on February 23 with an Enviroscan team, and with the Paradas looking on in a bone-cold, heavy downpour, the crew festooned the site with about 60 marker flags and logged more than 50 readings over two-foot increments.\n\nDuring a three-way call with Denny Parada and Getler several days later, Archer delivered Enviroscan’s findings: The gravimeter showed a mass with a density of 18 to 19—a result that indicated gold. And no small amount, either: The estimate was seven to nine tons. This was far more than the 26 gold bars from the Dents Run legend, which combined would have weighed only 1,300 pounds.\n\nParada’s mind reeled. Getler began bellowing. Nine tons of gold would be the largest land-based treasure in U.S. history—a haul worth $400 million to $600 million. The finding reinforced Getler’s theory that the site was an underground Copperhead depository.\n\nArcher said the FBI intended to get a warrant to excavate the site. He asked Denny and Kem to hide more cameras up there, and to check on the site as often as possible. Just over a week later, on March 10, Archer called again with news: The dig would happen in three days.\n\nThe FBI had worked quickly. Citing the Enviroscan findings and Getler’s historical research, the bureau on March 9 had obtained a federal warrant to dig up the hillside. Archer had written an affidavit stating there was “probable cause to believe that, in a cave on the Dents Run Site, approximately one or more tons of gold belonging to, and stolen from, the United States Mint… are secreted.” In signing the warrant, U.S. Magistrate Judge Richard Lloret had asserted the federal government’s power to push aside the state of Pennsylvania in a quest to reclaim gold that had been lost 155 years earlier. Archer wrote that he wanted to dig in secret, because tipping off state officials “could result in unlawful seizure of the stolen United States gold as abandoned property.” The federal government wanted to grab the gold before Pennsylvania could.\n\nThe affidavit is a fascinating 32-page document. Archer consulted experts from the National Archives, U.S. Mint, and other historical sites. He cited the lack of naturally occurring precious metals in the area, and spelled out the scientific rationale for a dig. The affidavit also reports the incident in which a Pennsylvania official dangled a dig permit in exchange for gold bars, and bores deeply into Dents Run mythology, adopting Getler’s theory that the Knights of the Golden Circle left waybills, codes, and symbols such as circles, rising suns, and turtles on rocks and trees to guide people to caches. Getler said the rock formation above the cave entrance looked like a turtle shell—and turtles are among the most important KGC symbols for gold. Citing the purported leaders of the ill-fated supply wagons in the Dents Run legend, Archer wrote, “It is very likely that Castleton and O’Rourke are fake names, and are in fact, code (Castle and Rook), with Castleton clearly being used as a pointer, as ‘castle’ was the key organizing unit of this secret subversive organization and ‘rook’ was a local unit of that organization.” Although this sounds like a passage lifted from a Dan Brown novel, the KGC is a documented part of the historical record of the era.\n\nHistory aside, Dents Run would have remained a sleepy and largely forgotten fold in the Pennsylvania hills without the Paradas, a team of untrained but hell-bent enthusiasts who had stalked the slopes for more than a decade, lugging equipment purchased at hardware stores. Their business name is taken from a childhood taunt, and their logo looks like a 1960s-style Looney Tunes creation. Stranger still? To this day, Denny credits Mike Malley, the ESP performer, with enabling the discovery—and has offered Malley a quarter of any funds he might receive for the gold.\n\nFor his part, Malley, now 82 and living in western Pennsylvania, says the show he performed for 22 years consisted entirely of staged illusions. “I certainly don’t call myself a psychic,” Malley says. “I don’t believe in psychics.”\n\nStill, on “very rare” instances—once every couple of decades—Malley says he’s able to intuit something. “It’s a certain feeling,” he says. “It’s like, somebody [asks] you, ‘Is it rainy outside?’ And you look outside—yeah, it’s raining. And you’re that certain of it. I can’t explain it.”\n\nMalley, who left show business in the 1980s to sell life insurance and annuities, seems genuinely at a loss to make sense of the Dent Run episode. But he says he’s been able to intuit information about the site on multiple occasions with Parada—starting when Denny handed him the magazine and atlas.\n\nOn the hourlong drive from their home base in Clearfield, Denny and Kem had the opportunity to contemplate the remarkable nature of everything that had happened up to that point. They were with Getler in Kem’s Mazda hatchback, because Archer had ordered them to travel incognito—no vehicles bearing the Finders Keepers logo. But when they arrived, Archer told them to stay in the car—the dig site was too crowded, and as a result too hazardous, to have them standing around.\n\nThe three men took in the scene through the Mazda windshield. The previous day, Kem had gone to check on the site and was surprised to see FBI agents already there. Now 25 vehicles sat at the base of the hill, along with four ATVs, a cargo truck, and a satellite van. At least 50 agents ringed the site’s perimeter. A staging area had been erected, including a green tent housing a command center. Portable toilets had been trucked in. They would later learn that the FBI had hired a local archeologist to provide expertise.\n\n“There was FBI all over that mountain,” Kem says. “It blew our minds.”\n\nHours crawled by with the three men pinned inside the Mazda. Archer stopped by occasionally to tell them to sit tight, saying they’d be able to hike up the mountain soon, but they grew increasingly impatient. When a local TV reporter showed up, agents hustled the trio inside the tent so they couldn’t talk.\n\nFinally, around 3 p.m., Archer led them to where the Paradas had spent countless hours over the years, many of them crawling in mud. About 30 agents wearing blue “FBI Evidence Response Team” jackets stood around a Kobelko excavator. Over the next hour, the machine dug down about seven feet before Archer called things to a halt.\n\nAs the Paradas and Getler recount, Archer said everyone was cold and hungry. “We’ve been here all day working; we’re gonna pack it up for the night,” the agent said. Archer instructed them to return at 8 a.m.\n\nThe three men were surprised, because there was plenty of daylight left. When they returned the next morning under a thin snowfall, Archer reported a glitch: The hole had filled with water, and they needed to check with the DCNR about potential environmental impacts. Once again, the Paradas and Getler were confined to their car, and the mood on the site shifted. Agents who’d previously been friendly barked at them, shooing them from the tent they’d taken shelter in the day before.\n\nAfter another five-hour-plus wait, Archer returned to again take them up the hill. The Paradas and Getler hustled from the car, excitement overriding their irritation—at last, they were about to see the results of their years of work. But Archer seemed downcast, as did the phalanx of agents who ringed the site. FBI personnel who had chatted amiably with them the previous day were stone-faced.\n\nThe Paradas and Getler took in the scene. The hole was free of water and mud, and had been dug 12 or 13 feet deep and about 25 feet wide. Archer asked Denny what he saw. The hole was empty. Parada replied, “I don’t see anything.”\n\nArcher announced, “That’s it, people, there’s nothing here, let’s go home,” Parada recalls. “I say, ‘No, wait a second. There’s nothing here now. It doesn’t mean there wasn’t something here yesterday or the day before. You’re the one that told me nine tons.’”\n\nParada was shouting. “You’re the one that wouldn’t let my guys up here while the dig happened,” he said. “You wouldn’t let us bring equipment.”\n\nAfter Denny vented, Archer ushered them downhill. Denny turned and asked him: “Did you or did you not find gold?\"\n\nThe agent refused to answer. Instead, Kem recalls, “Archer looked at the three of us and said, ‘I’m telling you right now, you don’t go to the media. You don’t put anything on Facebook. You put nothing online. You say nothing to nobody.’ He said, ‘If you do, there’ll be serious repercussions.’ And then he pointed at me and said, ‘and you got your law enforcement career to worry about.’”\n\nAnd with that, they were dismissed. Back at the car, Getler says, “I was literally in a state of shock.”\n\nThey couldn’t make sense of it. Their own extensive testing, and tests conducted by two professional outside firms, all showed the presence of a highly conductive and very dense mass—and even if it wasn’t gold, it was something. “I’ve been in this business too long,” Parada says. “You can have a false reading… If they would have pulled out some scrap metal of any kind, I wouldn’t question it. But to tell me nothing was found? No.”\n\nGetler observed: “When you do 50 scans with a very sensitive and precise gravimeter in five-foot increments, it’s a virtual geophysical fingerprint at that point.”\n\nWhen the Paradas returned a couple of days later with their GPL 200, the mass they had detected scores of times no longer turned up in their readings. The machine showed nothing at all.\n\nThat was eerie enough. Then they began to encounter people in nearby Weedville and Benezette, all of whom asked versions of the same question: “Did you see the armored trucks?”\n\nCheryl Elder knows what she heard.\n\nAs a resident who lives below the dig site, Elder had watched as dozens of federal vehicles rolled past and parked adjacent to her property. At 62, she’d never seen anything like it, and she’s lived her whole life in Elk County, the last 30 years in Dents Run. She served as constable for 20-plus years and had heard about the lost gold since she was a girl; her son had searched the hills with a metal detector.\n\nThe first full day they were there, she says, “I walked up, I was like, ‘What’s going on here?’ You know, you have FBI guys everywhere with their vests and guns and everything—they were guarding it. And he said, ‘Oh, nothing to worry about.’ I said, ‘Well, I live right here, I’m not worried. I mean, there’s enough FBI guys around here—why in the hell would I be worried?’”\n\nOn the night of March 13—in the hours after the FBI had sent the Paradas and Getler home—lights flooded the hillside, and Elder heard heavy work on the slope above: the sounds of a backhoe backing up, the rattling of a jackhammer. “They were digging all night up on that hill,” she says, sitting in her living room. “They had it so lit up that it looked like a city.”\n\nIn the middle of the night Elder called her husband, who was out of town. “I can’t sleep,” she told him. She was awake until nearly 3 a.m.\n\nWhen the FBI pulled out the next afternoon, agents blocked the road. A series of black Hummer-type armored vehicles passed, and in contrast to when they’d arrived, agents ordered her inside her house. She defiantly watched from her garage. “I just stood there with my dog watching them,” she says, “like, what are you gonna do, shoot me?”\n\nElder was baffled to hear the FBI’s claim that the search came up empty. “If they didn’t find anything, then why?” she says. “What was the big deal? Why would you have guards there?”\n\n“I know they found that gold,” she says.\n\nOther residents noticed unusual traffic on March 14 as well. Heather Selle of nearby Weedville told the Paradas that she saw armored cars around 8:30 a.m. as she loaded her child off to school. The vehicles looked like Lenco BearCat-type vehicles, capable of carrying more than two tons of cargo. A local cop called Kem to report that he’d watched armored vehicles, supported by two Humvees and a satellite truck, driving west on Route 555 from near Dents Run at about 10 a.m.\n\nAt Valley Farm Market in Weedville, various employees noticed FBI vehicles parked in an adjacent vacant lot for much of the day, and FBI personnel frequented the store. The shop, which features a variety of model trains and mounted deer heads, is the town’s nerve center.\n\nEmployee Mary Hogan says the FBI seemed to be mobilizing several armored vehicles. “It was an absolute circus in the vacant lot,” she says. “Why were they going through all this rigmarole if nothing was found?”\n\nGarrett Osche also noticed that the authorities had blocked roads in and out of Dents Run that day. “You don’t shut this road down… for two to three hours to send five armored trucks out of here that have nothing in ’em,” he says. The agents, he says, were “very sneaky about it, to put it mildly… As far as I’m concerned, this totally ruined my trust in the FBI.”\n\nGetler and the Paradas believe the vehicles’ movements were orchestrated. In the morning, the armored trucks that witnesses spotted came in after the three men had arrived at Dents Run. They think the vehicles circled around behind them to nearby Hicks Run, where the gold had been stored in SUVs overnight. “They were timing us to know when we’d be off the road so that those armored cars would come in behind us,” Getler says.\n\nThe vehicles waiting at Valley Farm Market were brought in to move the rest late in the afternoon, after the trio had been sent home. “This was done with military precision,” Getler asserts.\n\nThe developments left the rural town scandalized. “This is where we live,” Cheryl Elder says. “I mean, I’ve lived here all my life… How dare they?”\n\nThe worst part, she says—beyond how the Paradas were treated—is the lack of closure. “You’re going to take the gold, but give us the story,” Elder says. “Let us have the final version of what happened here. We grew up with this legend—this myth. Maybe it was real. At least tell us.”\n\nThe FBI issued a terse 44-word statement after the dig that stated, in part, “Nothing was found, and the excavation ended on Wednesday, March 14.” The bureau has said nothing further publicly ever since.\n\nAn FBI spokeswoman refused to make Archer available for questions. “Nothing was found in the excavation,” she declared via email. “The FBI unequivocally rejects any claims or speculation to the contrary. We’ll decline further comment.”\n\nBut the question of what happened on that hill has acquired its own gravitational pull. Emotions run high when people are short on facts. The Paradas’ attorney, Bill Cluck, filed a Freedom of Information request in May 2018 seeking records pertaining to the dig. The FBI initially responded that no such records exist, but later—after Cluck enlisted the help of U.S. Senator Pat Toomey—the bureau conceded that it possesses 2,378 pages of records and 17 CDs of videos. The file is so voluminous that the records won’t be processed for release until around March 2024. In January, Anne Weissman, an attorney who specializes in government transparency and accountability, filed a lawsuit on the Paradas’ behalf, seeking to accelerate the process.\n\nCluck also submitted an open-records request to Pennsylvania’s DCNR, and learned that on the day before the dig, Assistant U.S. Attorney K.T. Newton had emailed DCNR counsel to convey details about the dig. “We believe the cache itself is in the neighborhood of 3x5x8 or 5x5x8,” she wrote.\n\nNewton says the FBI was going with the best information it had at the time—that based on the results of all the testing and surveying, “it was believed that this was the size of the cache. The best we could do was use the best scientific evidence available to us at the time for probable cause: ‘This is what we believe to be there.’”\n\nShe says that turned out to be inaccurate. “The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office would have been more than happy and delighted if we had uncovered what we thought was there, but nothing was found.”\n\nFor the Paradas, surreality pervaded the dig’s aftermath. Maybe the most bizarre footnote: The night the FBI packed up and moved out, Michael Malley, the psychic performer, called Parada to say that he’d intuited something. Both Parada and Getler recall Malley telling them, “They’re moving nine tons of gold out of the country.”\n\nThe next day, news broke that part of a shipment of 9.3 tons of gold had fallen from a cargo plane on a runway in Siberia. According to the reports, nearly 200 bars had come from a mine operated by the Canada-based Kinross Gold Corporation—whose initials happen to be KGC. It was almost certainly just a coincidence, Parada says, but it was still indelibly strange.\n\nThe key question the treasure hunters want answered is this: How did several different scientific instruments that are staples in the geophysics industry—most specifically the gravimeter—all produce false readings? Newton was unable to account for the discrepancy. “We hire reputable companies, the testing is done, this is what the results are,” she says. “It’s never guaranteed. It’s always within—I don’t even know what the reasonable probabilities are—but we can only base it on what the testing tells us. As to what the science is and how that’s done, I am not a geologist.”\n\nThe perpetual questions about what happened are troubling, she says. “It is disturbing for us to have this still being put out there, that somehow the FBI is lying about this—that somehow this huge amount of gold was found, and we managed to spirit it out of that location in the middle of the night,” she says. “What better outcome for us than to say, ‘Look what was found,’ right? As opposed to, for some reason, this allegedly is somehow secreted away somewhere. I can’t figure out what possibly anybody would gain from that.”\n\nWhen I suggest that opening the FBI records might resolve the matter, Newton disagrees. “We unsealed the affidavit, we laid out the basis for what we thought was there, and… there was nothing found,” she says. “So I don’t know what else needs to be put out in the public record on this.”\n\nThe Paradas’ lawyers disagree. “I can’t believe (FBI officials) haven’t bothered to issue a report to the federal court,” Bill Cluck says. “They haven’t bothered to get back to the companies whose equipment was used. Because frankly, I practice environmental law, and I’m not going to trust Enviroscan and this equipment now that I know it doesn’t necessarily work.”\n\nEnviroscan, unfortunately, is barred from defending itself or elaborating on its findings. “We are under quite a strict gag order,” founder Timothy Bechtel replied to an email seeking comment. “I am to direct all inquiries to Agent Jake Archer of the FBI.”\n\nAnd, of course, there’s the issue of the Paradas’ unreimbursed years of work on Dents Run. Cluck says Pennsylvania is the only state that lacks a definitive supreme court decision on treasure troves, and his research indicates that by common law, Finders Keepers has a right to petition federal courts “for their fair share [of the gold], if it was found.” Parada wants a 10 percent finder’s fee—$40 million to $60 million—and he believes a confirmed finding of gold would bring book and movie rights to his story.\n\nBut Parada says money is only part of the equation. Despite the business name he chose, Parada isn’t looking to possess any of his discoveries; he wants various finds returned to their rightful owners, if possible. If gold buried at Dents Run bore the markings of the U.S. Mint, he accepts that it’s government property. And when he leans away from the specifics of Dents Run in his mind, he sees something bigger: Malley’s help, along with other unspecified supernatural occurrences he declines to elaborate on, have convinced him that spirits of the departed help guide his efforts. He believes they want “somebody to come around to find these things and make sure they go to the right place. If souls that have crossed over are helping us, that means there’s an afterlife, and that’s a good thing.\n\n“I know it sounds crazy,” he adds after a beat. “But this is my life.”\n\nMalley feels conflicted about his role in what he characterizes as a borderline unhealthy quest. He’s suggested to Parada multiple times that he let Dents Run go. “It became an obsession, in my mind, of him going after (the gold),” Malley says. “I mean, no matter how hard I tried to talk him out of it, he wouldn’t budge… I said, ‘Dennis, this is too consuming for you; it’s not going to go anywhere.’ And he said, ‘I can’t stop now, Mike.’”\n\nThe layers of irony are unfathomably rich: Parada became convinced of psychic powers—and was propelled in his quest—by a performer who doesn’t believe in psychic powers. And he embraced the FBI in order to solve his life’s biggest mystery—and wound up with an even bigger one. Before, Parada was merely looking for the X that marks the spot; now, the answer resides inside a hall of mirrors—the treasure there but not there, seemingly receding further from him the closer he gets.\n\nParada’s unselfconsciousness through it all is both unsettling and disarming. He’s able to stand apart from his narrative, observe how absurdly unlikely it is, and then use that awareness to argue even more convincingly on his own behalf. Most people in his situation would cave in to exasperated uncertainty; his adversity and lived experience has only ripened into deeper conviction. He has no trouble reconciling the life that he’s lived to the one he imagines. His redemption could always be just a few shovelfuls of dirt away.\n\n“All I want is credit for solving these mysteries,” he says. “So many people have died for those treasures to be there. It’s not ours. The last thing we’d ever do is dig something up and put it in our pocket and never tell anybody. More than anything, I want the truth to come out. I wanna know where that gold went to.”\n\nThe good news for the Paradas is that they always have a new mission.\n\nThe day after visiting Dents Run in summer 2021, the Paradas and Getler take me to another site they’re investigating nearby. After the FBI dig, Denny received a call from a man who had grown up in an area known for harboring unidentified mounds and Civil War-era artifacts.\n\nExploring the site, the Finders Keepers team discovered what they believe are bullets, belt buckles from Union uniforms, and parts of a limber wagon, a two-wheeled cart that carried ammunition and artillery. They also found Knights of the Golden Circle symbols, including a circular stone carved in the shape of a Native American headdress similar to what appears on a copperhead penny. One of the team also found a “turtle rock”—a stone with an image of a turtle on it. Unfurling the map beforehand, Getler points to the spot. “That’s a turtle, no question,” he says. “If you read my book, the turtle always points to the treasure.” Getler also located a waybill—a KGC coded map—that matches certain features of the area.\n\nThe group returned with their array of detection equipment and located more underground metal masses and what appeared, on their instruments, to be a tunnel. Measuring off distances, they created a massive hand-drawn map. These efforts yielded an astonishingly far-reaching theory: They believe they’ve located a buried KGC garrison. Fifteen feet underground, they say, is essentially a military base the size of three football fields. Numerous tunnels lead to as many as 21 chambers potentially harboring Civil War cannons, arms, ammunition, and more. “I think every wagon they hijacked for gold or supplies, they brought back to this camp and buried them all,” Denny says.\n\nIf they’re correct about what they call Copperhead Central, they believe the site will rewrite history books. They theorize that it was the secret rendezvous point for General Robert E. Lee and his troops in late spring 1863—to collect looted gold and link up with KGC militia—when they fatefully ran into Union forces at Gettysburg. “If this is right,” Getler says, “you’re on to the biggest story you could ever imagine in terms of how outrageously wild it is.”\n\nBack in Clearfield, in the low-slung, tucked-away home that serves as the Finders Keepers headquarters, the three men unfold their map, several square feet in area, onto which they’ve overlaid a transparency showing the theoretical KGC compound. Items from Denny’s years of exploration, many of them rusty and crumbling, cover nearly every horizontal surface. A New York Times story about Finders Keepers, which includes a photo of Parada, hangs on the wall.\n\nAs with Dents Run, the Paradas are endeavoring to gird their towering theories with a scientific foundation. They’ve hired a New Jersey outfit, American Geophysics Inc., to scan the location using ground-penetrating radar and an EM-31. On the first of two days at the site, two members of the American Geophysics crew walk the site, flagging the ground at locations indicated by Parada and Getler. Then they scan it with their gear, which includes a 12-foot boom.\n\nGetler and the Paradas buzz with anticipation—but they’re also aware that the science may reveal gaps between their ironclad convictions and the reality of what lies underground.\n\nDCNR District Forester Douglas D’Amore, for one, is expecting the team of treasure hunters to leave the site disappointed. D’Amore is on site, watching and taking photographs, to ensure that the activity conforms to approved activities—scanning, but no digging. Parada regales him with earnest, bubbling-over theories about Copperhead Central, but D’Amore no-sells the pitch, standing with his body angled away and avoiding eye contact. Later, D’Amore offers a detailed alternative theory: Whatever lies underground on the site is far more likely the result of logging operations that were based there.\n\nIt’s not hard to channel D’Amore’s skepticism, trudging among the trees. The surroundings feel like one unremarkable patch of woods among hundreds of square miles of them. And the dynamic between the Paradas and Getler could be read as endlessly looping confirmation bias. Then there’s the zealous embrace of the supernatural and the unreconstructed use of dowsing rods. Yet everyone involved—Denny most of all—argues their case with the ferocity of a true believer. And in his contempt for government interference, Denny tends to characterize any bureaucratic speed bump —for example, the DCNR’s environmental permitting requirements—as evidence of persecution and obstruction.\n\nTheir collective quest exists inside the space where the supernatural meets science, ardent belief meets cold reality, and heat maps meet hard earth. They see themselves as an unstoppable force pitted against a movable object—if only they exert enough sweat and resources. It’s a years-long grind that few beyond the Paradas would countenance.\n\nBut: The American Geophysics crew produces a heat map showing four large, anomalous metal shapes underground, including a 10-foot mass. Optimism pulses through the gathering, and the Finders Keepers crew, feeling exultant, convinces D’Amore to try the dowsing rods.\n\nAfter receiving the final results from American Geophysics, the Paradas ask the state of Pennsylvania to excavate the site. When several months pass with no answer, Parada looks into obtaining permits to start digging, in the hope that a remarkable discovery will prompt an official entity—a museum or university—to take over.\n\nFor now, that leaves the Paradas in a kind of treasure-hunter limbo. If the truth emerges that tons of gold bars were on that Pennsylvania hillside, the story of their ardent and tenacious journey will become just as mythical and enduring as the cache of precious metal. Somehow, the scaffolding of belief they built around the site held up across more than a decade of gale-force bureaucratic headwinds.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the point of the bizarre tale of Dents Run. Maybe the truth of the gold—tantalizing though it may be—doesn’t really matter. Maybe what’s important is the manner in which Denny Parada embodies the yearning, the quest—the believing—for objects that transport us, time out of mind, to distant people and times. Who doesn’t yearn to follow the map to the mythical X, to crunch through the woods, staring at the ground, wondering what mysteries it holds?\n\nOf course, the most likely answer is that there’s nothing down there. But what if?\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Bank of America's latest survey of fund managers shows that bullishness is running high as the market heads into 2026.\n\nAnalyst Michael Harnett on Tuesday highlighted the findings from the bank's latest survey of 238 fund managers, which showed the group is the most bullish they've been in three-and-a-half years.\n\nThis widespread optimism stems from the view that the US will avoid a recession that some bears have predicted and achieve a soft landing as macroeconomic conditions hold up and continue to support the market.\n\nBofA's survey also found that cash levels among fund managers have fallen to their lowest level on record, demonstrating high investor participation in the market. Cash is down to 3.3% from 3.7% in the latest report.\n\n\"Our broadest measure of FMS sentiment, based on cash level, equity allocation, and global growth expectations, rose to 7.4 from 6.4, the highest level since Jul'21,\" he said.\n\nThe survey showed that 57% of fund managers expect the economy to cool while only 3% believe that a recession is looming, a record low for that figure. Thirty-seven percent don't expect the economy to slow at all.\n\n\"On the macro…FMS global growth expectations rose to the most optimistic level since Aug'21 (net 18%, up from net 3%),\" Harnett added.\n\nThe number of fund managers who expect corporate profits to rise reached 29%, the highest since April 2021. Harnett noted that the survey respondents see the AI bubble bursting or a private credit-related crash as the biggest tail risks for the market.\n\nHe added that fund managers also see potential danger in the most crowded trades, specifically in the leading tech stocks of the Magnificent Seven. This is in keeping with the recent sentiment from market pundits that investors should start to look for opportunities outside the AI trade in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Google threw down the AI image gauntlet last month. Now, OpenAI has answered.\n\nThe ChatGPT creator announced the rollout of a new flagship image generator on Tuesday, which the company says is capable of making faster, more precise edits to an AI image while maintaining details.\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Images, powered by our flagship new image generation model.\n\n- Stronger instruction following\n- Precise editing\n- Detail preservation\n- 4x faster than before\n\nRolling out today in ChatGPT for all users, and in the API as GPT Image 1.5. pic.twitter.com/NLNIPEYJnr\n\nBut the more eye-catching change for many user will likely be the improvements to image quality and the AI model's ability to follow specific instructions.\n\nOpneAI said the new model offers \"clear improvements across a range of cases.\" In one example, the company showed off the differences between the old and new image model when prompted to generate a photorealistic scene in 1970s Chelsea, London.\n\nIn another example touting use cases for businesses using the company's image API, OpenAI compared the outputs showing a mechanic working on a car.\n\nWhile a model's ability to generate photorealistic images has become a popular point of comparison in the AI race, OpenAI's latest model can also generate animated images, graphics, and other styles of artwork.\n\nPerhaps to boost awareness of that, the company is rolling out a new Images feature within the ChatGPT app. While AI image generation was previously available within ChatGPT, OpenAI says the new dedicated Images feature is designed to \"spark inspiration and make creative exploration effortless.\"\n\nThe news comes just over three weeks after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model alongside its flagship Gemini 3 LLM — both of which have received widespread praise and reignited the debate around whether Google had begun to overtake OpenAI in the AI race.\n\nGoogle's new AI image generator was lauded for its hyper-realistic AI images, which some people used over Thanksgiving to make it appear as if they had famous guests at the holiday dinner table.\n\nYuchen Jin, the cofounder and CTO of the startup Hyperbolic Labs, called OpenAI's new model \"Nano Banana Pro level in my tests.\"",

    "fullText": "Collectors paid a pretty penny to get their hands to get the very last minted pennies.\n\nStack's Bowers Galleries, a specialized coin auction site, said it sold 232 three-coin sets featuring some of the final pennies ever struck for a grand total of $16.76 million.\n\nThese coins aren't like the ones stuck between your couch cushions or floating around in a junk drawer. One coin was struck at the Philadelphia Mint, one was struck at the Denver Mint, and the final coin was a special 24-karat gold penny. Each of the final pennies also bears a small \"Ω,\" the Greek letter of Omega, further signifying the end of an era that stretches back to the establishment of the US Mint in 1792.\n\nAccording to the auction site, the roughly $17 million is a record for special coins sold on behalf of the United States Mint.\n\n\"They captured the public imagination like few rare coins we've ever handled,\" Stack's Bowers Galleries President Brian Kendrella said in a statement. \"Even our staff of expert numismatists, who see the world's most famous and valuable rare coins day in and day out, were excited by the chance to handle the very last pennies struck before the suspension of circulating production.\"\n\nIn February, President Donald Trump announced that he had instructed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to halt production of new pennies. For decades, leaders of both major political parties had talked about killing the single-cent coin due to the increasing cost of production. The US Mint reported losing over $85 million on penny production in FY 2024.\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump had the authority to unilaterally eliminate the penny, but ultimately, the administration proceeded with its plans. A 2024 New York Times Magazine report popularized the legal theory that a section of the US Code gave the Secretary of the Treasury the power to effectively discontinue the penny.\n\nIn May, the US Mint made its final order of penny blanks. By November, the final US penny was struck in a ceremonial process aided by Treasurer of the United States Brandon Beach.\n\nFittingly, the final penny auction was broken down into 232 lots, one for each year of the coin's existence. The final lot \"included the very last circulating penny intended for issuance struck at Philadelphia and Denver\" in addition to the canceled dies used to strike the final series of coins.\n\nSet 232 sold for $800,000, or 16 million nickels.",

    "description": "Brooke Parrish was born with Pfeiffer syndrome, a rare genetic condition  affecting her facial features. She gained confidence over the years.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Brooke Parrish, 29, a higher education admissions advisor and TikToker who lives in Louisville, Kentucky. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe doctors in the rural area in Kentucky, where I was born in March 1996, were unsure of my condition when I was born.\n\nThey referred me to a hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, a two-hour drive away, where I was diagnosed with Pfeiffer syndrome.\n\nThe genetic condition — which is caused by early fusion of the bones in the uterus — strikes people differently. In my case, it led to the premature fusion of my skull and elbows, also affecting some of my fingers and toes.\n\nMy parents, Angela and Chip, now 55, relocated to Louisville, where I had several cranial procedures when I was young.\n\nMom and Dad were incredibly supportive. Mom didn't treat me any differently, as if I were fragile. I would climb the stairs just as much as my cousins did.\n\nI tried not to limit myself, despite being challenged by the lower range of motion in my arms. I couldn't lift them beyond my breastbone and could only touch my face with two fingers.\n\nMeanwhile, the pain was intense from the operations and healing.\n\nThere is a difference between knowing that you have a certain condition and accepting the reality of it. I didn't speak about it for years.\n\nIn fact, I internalized it. I never saw myself falling in love or getting married.\n\nThankfully, I wasn't bullied, but the other kids would often stare at me. Between the ages of 13 and 18, I grew bangs to cover my eyes, which were my main concern. I could hardly see where I was going.\n\nThen, as I grew older, I began to gain confidence. My bangs got shorter over the years. It was a sign that I'd become more accepting of myself.\n\nI realized that going through so much at a young age gave me the strength and resilience I needed to overcome challenges. Over time, I began to accept my differences.\n\nI wished I could have given my younger self a hug and told her that she'd become grounded and happy.\n\nWhen I got a job as a cashier at a retail store, I dealt with the stares I got by being super friendly. I'd strike up a conversation, rather than deal with any awkwardness. It worked. People were receptive.\n\nI went on several dates between 18 and 21 because I had a lot of catching up to do.\n\nMy preference was online dating. Unfortunately, as much as I would have liked someone to fall for my personality, I wanted the men on the site to make an initial decision based on my photograph. I was fully transparent.\n\nOne guy I was involved with for a few months couldn't cope with the stares. He couldn't handle what came with someone with multiple disabilities. And that's OK. It's not for everyone.\n\nI met my future husband, Joe, now 30, on Tinder eight years ago. It was cute because, two days before our official first date, he popped into the store I worked in unannounced.\n\nHe said that he wanted to take away the nerves of getting ready and driving to our first date. We walked around the store to get to know each other a little. He was right because our first date was more relaxed.\n\nWe've been together ever since, and our beautiful wedding was in October 2021. I never expected a man to be so attentive and devoted. He does anything for me that I can't do with my arms. He can braid my hair and create updos. He puts on my necklaces and earrings. It's the little things that count, and they're wonderful.\n\nI want people with facial differences to know that, through TikTok, you can feel powerful and proud. I've had an overwhelming response from people with or without craniofacial disabilities.\n\nOne of my pen pals is a 15-year-old with a condition like mine. It's like looking in a mirror. I want her to be strong, open about who she is, and to allow other people to love and help her.",

    "title": "4 takeaways from the final jobs report of the year",
    "description": "Here's what unemployment, wage growth, and other newly released data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed.",
    "fullText": "This week brought a vanishingly rare jobs report on Tuesday after the longest government shutdown in history threw a wrench in federal data collection, and it was a mixed bag.\n\nThe new data emphasized trends we've been seeing this year, including unemployment inching up and a tougher market for many job seekers.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics delayed the report from December 5 to extend data collection and processing after its activities were affected by the government shutdown that lasted from October to about mid-November.\n\nThe new data allowed economists, job seekers, reporters, and more to understand how job growth looked in both October and November; the BLS didn't produce an October jobs report last month. While the report was missing items like the October unemployment rate, it gives us a fresh look at the labor market.\n\nHere are four takeaways from the latest jobs report.\n\nBoth Nicole Bachaud, a labor Economist at ZipRecruiter, and Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, described the job market as still stagnant.\n\nThe US economy added 64,000 jobs in November, surpassing the 50,000 expected. That comes after a big net loss in October, largely because federal workers who took the deferred resignation offered as part of the DOGE job cuts earlier this year finally appeared in the data after the deferment ended.\n\nData published by the BLS last week showed job openings have been trending upward as of October, although they're still far below what job seekers were accustomed to a few years ago. Workers' confidence has also been low, as October's quit rate was the lowest since 2020.\n\n\"Job growth has been very slow over the course of 2025, and it doesn't seem like we've turned around quite yet to translate the pent-up demand for hiring and the recent increase in job openings into actual hires,\" Bachaud said, adding that uncertainty over tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical issues has added to companies holding back on hiring plans.\n\n\"That's the big question mark — when is that uncertainty going to finally ease up?\" she said.\n\nThe better-than-expected growth in November was largely helped by job growth in healthcare, so Ullrich said this \"doesn't show a whole lot of strength in the macro labor market.\"\n\nHealthcare and social assistance sectors together had a net gain of 64,000 over the month. Most industries had a decline or a small rise in employment. Manufacturing, for instance, has continued its ongoing net loss.\n\nHealthcare has been a bright spot throughout the year, and Bachaud said there will still be demand for workers as the population ages. However, it could be challenging for job seekers to pivot into these positions. Ullrich said many jobs in the sector typically require certain training and education.\n\n\"Construction is the other industry that we saw really strong growth in, as there is demand for continued skilled trades,\" Bachaud said. Construction added 28,000 jobs, with the largest growth from specialty trade contractors.\n\nWage growth has gradually cooled and reached the lowest point so far this year in November. Average hourly earnings rose 3.5% from a year ago.\n\nThe generally softer job market has made it harder for workers to negotiate higher wages. Ullrich said physicians have better wage-setting power than roles that aren't seeing a lot of openings and where talent is waiting on the sidelines for a role.\n\nShe said employers can probably offer lower raises to current talent, too, since more people are staying put.\n\n\"If you know people aren't quitting, you might not have to offer them the same bump in pay that you would if the quits rate was higher,\" she said. \"That being said, there's still very tight competition for certain roles.\"\n\nThe October 2025 unemployment rate won't ever be released because that data, typically gathered from a survey of around 60,000 households a month, couldn't be collected during or after the government shutdown. However, unemployment had been trending upward before that, and November was the same story.\n\nNovember's unemployment rate was the highest since September 2021 and slightly higher than expected. Still, the Bureau of Labor Statistics warned of data issues with unemployment and related figures over the next few months due to the missing October household survey, so economists and others will have to see how the rate continues to pan out.\n\nDespite the data challenges, Bachaud said the higher unemployment rate and stickier long-term unemployment, where people have been out of a job for at least 27 weeks and actively searching, indicate that it has become harder to land a job.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Ellison, the former cryptocurrency executive and ex-girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, has been quietly moved out of federal lockup after serving roughly 11 months of her two-year prison sentence, Business Insider has learned.\n\nEllison, 31, was transferred on October 16 from the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut to what's known as community confinement, a Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesperson said.\n\nThat means Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research cryptocurrency hedge fund, remains in federal custody but is now either in home confinement or a halfway house, BOP spokesperson Randilee Giamusso told Business Insider.\n\n\"For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any individual, including reasons for transfers or release plans, nor do we specify an individual's specific location while in community confinement,\" Giamusso said.\n\nOnline prison records list Ellison's projected release date as February 20, 2026 — nearly nine months early. Her attorneys declined to comment for this story.\n\nEllison reported to the low-security Danbury prison in early November 2024 to serve a two-year sentence she received for her role in the massive multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that led to the collapse of Bankman-Fried's business empire.\n\nShe had pleaded guilty to conspiring with Bankman-Fried — the founder of the FTX crypto exchange and its sister company, Alameda Research — in the $11 billion fraud scheme.\n\nEllison served as the star witness in Bankman-Fried's 2023 criminal trial, testifying that the pair used Alameda to invest billions of dollars' worth of assets secretly siphoned from FTX customers.\n\nAt Ellison's sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan praised her \"substantial\" cooperation in the prosecution of Bankman-Fried, but said the seriousness of the case still required prison time.\n\nHer lawyers had asked that the judge not impose any prison time, but Kaplan rejected what he called a \"literal get-out-of-jail-free card.\"\n\nBefore she was sentenced, Ellison, holding back tears, apologized and expressed regret for her participation in the fraud scheme.\n\n\"On some level, my brain doesn't even comprehend all the people I harmed,\" Ellison told the court. \"That doesn't mean I don't try.\"\n\nBankman-Fried was sentenced by Kaplan to 25 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThe FTX founder and former CEO remains behind bars at a low-security federal prison in San Pedro, California, as he appeals his conviction and sentence.\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have argued that he should get a new trial after prosecutors unfairly previewed his testimony.",

At $99 a year, you'll save almost $21 annually compared to what you'd pay if you were subscribed to the monthly plan ($10 a month) for 12 months. Instacart Plus grants subscribers $0 grocery delivery fees (on orders $10+, or $35+ at Costco, plus service fees) and $0 restaurant delivery fees on eligible $25+ orders (plus service fees). An additional perk exclusive to the annual plan is a one-year subscription to New York Times Cooking (a $50 value).\n\nOur favorite Instacart Plus benefit is the complimentary Peacock Premium subscription, which would otherwise cost $110 a year. This means that an annual subscription to Instacart Plus essentially pays for itself (and then some), especially if Peacock is something that you're already planning to \n\nThe Instacart Plus offer grants users access to Peacock Premium, which is Peacock's middle ad-supported tier.

    "fullText": "Nick Reiner is set to be charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the death of his parents, legendary Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife, producer Michele Singer Reiner, prosecutors said Tuesday.\n\nThe couple was found dead at their home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles on Sunday. The younger Reiner, age 32, was arrested around 9:15 p.m. PT on Sunday.\n\nDistrict Attorney Nathan Hochman announced the charges during a press conference, saying they would be filed Tuesday. Hochman said the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. He added a decision on seeking the death penalty has not yet been made.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department, which investigated the deaths, previously said in a statement that it \"determined that the Reiners were the victims of homicide\" and that Nick Reiner \"was responsible for their deaths.\"\n\nRob Reiner directed notable Hollywood classics like \"The Princess Bride,\" When Harry Met Sally,\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"\n\nHe also directed \"Being Charlie,\" a movie cowritten by Nick Reiner and largely based on the younger Reiner's own life and struggle with drug addiction.\n\nPolice said during the press conference that Nick Reiner was arrested without incident in the Exposition Park area near the University of Southern California campus.\n\nHochman said after the charges are filed Nick Reiner would be brought to court to be arraigned, at which point he will enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.\n\nHochman urged the public to avoid rumors about the case that do not come from official sources, like LAPD or the district attorney's office. \"Please do not rely on rank speculation, rumor, or hearsay to believe that you understand anything about what went on in this case,\" he said.\n\nCorrection: December 16, 2025 — This story was corrected to reflect the correct name. Director Rob Reiner died, not Rick Reiner.",

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

    "description": "AG Ken Paxton accused Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense and TCL of \"spying on Texans.\"",
    "fullText": "Behold: Ken Paxton will now demonstrate that broken clocks are indeed right twice a day. The Texas Attorney General is notorious for, well, a very long list of reasons. But in this case, he at least appears to be doing consumers a solid: He sued five television companies for using ad-targeting spyware on their TVs.\n\nTexas sued Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense and TCL for allegedly recording what viewers watch without their consent. The predatory technology, Automated Content Recognition (ACR), identifies the content being played on a device by matching short content fingerprints to a database.\n\nACR is essentially a Shazam for video. Except in this case, its sole purpose is to target your viewing habits to help line advertisers' pockets. \"This software can capture screenshots of a user's television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time and transmit that information back to the company without the user's knowledge or consent,\" Paxton's press release says.\n\nAn LG Ad Solutions website boasts how ACR helps advertisers \"target by content viewership, including show, network, app, service or genre.\" Since it works with anything running on the device, it can identify purchases and subscriptions, track gamers' habits and pinpoint users by region, city or zip code.\n\nThere should be a setting on your TV to turn it off. But, as Texas' lawsuit against LG notes, TV software often \"deceptively guides consumers to activate ACR and buries any explanation of what that means in dense legal jargon that few will read or understand.\"\n\nPaxton's press release emphasized Hisense and TCL's home base of China. \"These Chinese ties pose serious concerns about consumer data harvesting and are exacerbated by China's National Security Law, which gives its government the capability to get its hands on US consumer data,\" the statement reads.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — The State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) has taken over a troubled Las Vegas-area school, seeking to correct financial and academic problems.\n\nSPCSA declined last Friday to renew the license for Nevada Prep Charter School, effectively setting them up for closure. However, a document leaked to 8 News Now shows disciplinary issues at the school are also at the center of an investigation.\n\n‘Diddy him and do freaky things’: Leaked report shows bad student behavior at Las Vegas charter school\n\nThe leaked report documented hundreds of incidents of bad student behavior at the kindergarten through eighth-grade school.\n\nStudents threatened to kill other students, were caught vaping or with marijuana, and repeatedly used racial slurs, including the N-word.\n\nIn response, emailed to 8 News Now, SPCSA Executive Director Melissa Mackedon said the disclosure violates FERPA, which stands for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and is under “active investigation.”\n\nAccording to the leaked report, a fifth grader who was listed as a problem child shoved a kid into a wall, pulled down their pants, and said he was going to “Diddy him and do freaky things.” Teachers also said the child’s screensaver was a picture of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nA fourth grader, who had 16-pages worth of complaints, reportedly destroyed classrooms, assaulted teachers, and threatened to kill students. An eighth grader reportedly showed others threatening videos, including one of a beheading with a machete, and said he would do that to them.\n\nMackedon stated over email that Nevada Prep’s “leadership is no longer in place,” and an experienced administrator named Joshua Kern has been appointed to close the school out.\n\n“Mr. Kern has significant experience negotiating with vendors and resolving outstanding financial obligations, which is a critical component of an orderly and fiscally responsible school closure,” Samantha King Powell, the general counsel for the State Public Charter School Authority said.\n\nAccording to documents from SPCSA, Nevada Prep is “experiencing a significant and sustained decline in academic performance over the past two years.” Nevada Prep’s elementary and middle schools went from a three-star rating to one star.\n\nThe State Public Charter School Authority has a meeting scheduled for Jan. 23, 2026, to discuss the next steps for Nevada Prep.\n\nIn response to the disciplinary reports, Nevada Prep told 8 News Now the documents were leaked as a smear campaign and that the kids with bad behavior were transferred out of the school.\n\nAccording to Mackedon, the State Public Charter School Authority intends to reopen Nevada Prep under a new charter organization, Academies of Math and Science. That process would still be subject to approval.",

    "fullText": "The province has said that two deer hunted in B.C.'s Kootenay region have tested positive for chronic wasting disease, also known as \"zombie deer disease.\"\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the province said the two new cases were confirmed in a management zone set up to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious and fatal illness affecting species such as deer, elk, moose and caribou.\n\nThe condition, which has a 100 per cent fatality rate, has been spreading throughout the Kootenay region after being detected for the first time ever in the province last year.\n\nWithin the management zone, the B.C. government requires hunters to submit samples for free testing, and to report sick animals.\n\nThere are also restrictions on transporting carcasses in the Kootenay region due to the disease.\n\n“Protecting B.C.’s wildlife is a shared responsibility, and we are grateful to hunters, First Nations and community partners who are working with us to respond and manage the disease effectively,\" said Land and Resource Stewardship Minister Randene Neill in the province's statement.\n\nThe province says there have been eight confirmed cases of \"zombie deer disease\" in B.C., according to the province, all located within the Kootenays in the southeast corner of the province.\n\nIn its statement, the government says there would be a special hunt in the CWD management zone where hunters would be able to harvest one additional deer, beyond a regional limit of two, in order to support disease surveillance efforts.\n\nLate last month, the province investigated a potential case of chronic wasting disease in the neighbouring Okanagan region. The province said last week that testing confirmed a sample from a deer harvested east of Enderby, B.C., was negative for chronic wasting disease.\n\nThe province is encouraging hunters outside the Kootenays, especially in the Peace region adjacent to Alberta, to voluntarily submit samples from harvested deer, elk and moose.\n\n“Hunters and hunting continue to be the best tool we have to identify and manage chronic wasting disease,\" said Jesse Zeman, executive director of the B.C. Wildlife Federation, in the province's statement.\n\nPrion diseases like chronic wasting disease are a family of rare neurodegenerative disorders that can be found in both humans and animals, impairing brain function.\n\nWhile there is no direct evidence the disease can be transmitted to humans and there have been no cases in humans, the ministry says Health Canada and the World Health Organization recommend people not eat the meat of an infected animal.\n\nPerhaps the best known example of a prion disease is bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly referred to as mad cow disease.",

    "fullText": "More details are being uncovered about the events of the holiday party attended by Rob Reiner, his wife Michele Singer Reiner, and their son Nick Reiner, the night before the couple were found dead in their home.\n\nSources told NBC News Tuesday that during the family's time at the party hosted by Conan O'Brien on Saturday night, Nick's strange behavior had his parents and other guests worried.\n\nOne source claimed that the Being Charlie co-writer had an unsettling encounter with comedian Bill Hader, in which the latter was chatting with another guest before being interrupted by Nick. When Hader told him the conversation was private, Nick allegedly appeared to stand still and stare before \"storming off.\"\n\nAnother source told the outlet that Rob and Michele were \"upset and embarrassed\" about their son's behavior at the party and expressed worries about his health.\n\nEntertainment Weekly reached out to representatives of Bill Hader for comment.\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nAs previously reported, sources told PEOPLE on Monday that Nick and his father had been involved in a loud heated argument during the holiday party on Saturday, with one source recalling Nick \"freaking everyone out, acting crazy, kept asking people if they were famous.\" According to TMZ, the couple left the party following the argument.\n\nRob and Michele — who got married in 1989 after meeting while Rob was directing When Harry Met Sally... — were discovered on Sunday afternoon by their youngest child, daughter Romy, 27. Per a statement from the LAPD, at approximately 3:40 p.m. police responded to a call of a death investigation and found the deceased, who were identified as the longtime couple.\n\n\"As a result of the initial investigation, it was determined that the Reiners were the victims of homicide,\" the statement read. \"The investigation further revealed that Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of Robert and Michele Reiner, was responsible for their deaths. Nick Reiner was located and arrested at approximately 9:15 p.m.\"\n\nNick was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday morning to potentially be formally charged, but as  The New York Times reports, Nick's attorney, Alan Jackson, told reporters at the courthouse that his client had not been medically cleared to be transferred from the jail to the courthouse and that there would not be a hearing.\n\nLater that day, the L.A. County District Attorney announced that Nick will be charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the murder of his parents. If found guilty, Nick could face life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Nick could also face the death penalty, which has been under a governor-imposed moratorium in California since 2019.",

    "title": "Pumas came back to Patagonia—and met penguins. What happened next surprised scientists.",
    "description": "A natural experiment in a national park in Patagonia shows how the return of a large predator can reshape an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "For decades, pumas preyed on sheep from ranches along Argentina’s coast, and ranchers hunted them—heavily.Pumas disappeared from the landscape. Then, in 2004, conservationists established Monte León National Park in the region. As expected, once the hunting stopped, the big cats came back. And when they returned, they found a new player in their old neighborhood: Magellanic penguins.\n\nWhat scientists did not anticipate was that not only would pumas prey on penguins—but that the birds’ seasonal arrival would reorganize how these famously solitary cats move, interact, and hunt across the landscape. A new study published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B documents this shift in puma behavior for the first time and challenges our assumptions about what happens when large predators return to an ecosystem.\n\n“When we start to rewild the land, the species that are coming back might find a system that is a bit different from the one that they used to inhabit 100 years ago—and they adapt to it,” says Emiliano Donadio, science director at the Fundación Rewilding Argentina and a coauthor of the study.\n\n(How a penguin 'massacre' led to historic new protections in Argentina)\n\nThe researchers didn’t initially set out to study this unique predator-prey relationship. Lead author and ecologist Mitchell Serota, then at the University of California Berkeley, was working with Fundación Rewilding Argentina to study how wildlife responds when human pressures are removed from former ranchlands. “I went down to Patagonia to understand restoration outcomes broadly. The penguins weren’t the original focus at all,” he says.\n\nIn 2023, Serota and his colleagues reported that the big cats were actually feeding on the gawky birds. “That interaction was known, but we thought it was minor,” he says. “Maybe just a handful of individuals.”\n\nThe team had installed 32 camera traps across the park and tracked 14 adult pumas (Puma concolor) with GPS collars between September 2019 and January 2023. Combining that data with field observations, the researchers quickly realized pumas were snacking on penguins much more frequently than expected.\n\n“We were getting repeated detections of pumas right around the penguin colony,” Serota recalls. “That’s when it became clear this was not a side note. It was something shaping how these animals were using the landscape.”\n\nBecause Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) spend much of their lives at sea, they are unusual prey for a large terrestrial carnivore whose diet is mostly made up of land mammals, such as deer, guanacos (relatives of llamas), and hares. But during their breeding season—roughly September through April—the seabirds huddle on land in large numbers. At Monte León, more than 40,000 breeding pairs nest along a coastline of about two kilometers long.\n\n(What Magellanic penguins are teaching us about survival)\n\nFor a puma, whose territory can cover hundreds of square kilometers, this creates an odd situation: an extremely abundant food source, concentrated in a very small area, and available only part of the year. The team found that the population density remained similar—around 13 cats per 100 square kilometers—whether penguins were present or absent. So, penguins did not create more pumas, but reorganized how these cats share space.\n\nPenguin-eating pumas, it turns out, behave quite differently from those who prefer other diets in Patagonia. The study found that bird-eating big cats shared the same area much more frequently than non-bird-eating ones and were not attacking each other as often as one would expect. “In other words, penguin-eating pumas were quite tolerant of the presence of one another,” says Donadio, who is also a National Geographic Explorer.\n\nSuch tolerance was a surprise, given the pumas’ loner stereotype. In Patagonia, these big cats are out in the open, as they are the top predator. “Unlike Africa, they don’t need to scrum together to take down prey twice or three times their size. And unlike North America, there are no grizzly bears, black bears or wolves, so these cats are not sneaking around in the trees at night like they are up here,” says Jim Williams, who worked for decades as a biologist with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and wrote about the relationship between the seabirds and big cats in his book Path of the Puma.\n\nTo some degree, it makes sense that pumas pounced on the new food source, as penguins are low-risk prey. “Big cats—lions, panthers, cougars, pumas—always prey on the most abundant and vulnerable food sources available,” says Williams, who was not affiliated with the current study. “That’s not shocking from an ecological point of view or a natural behavior, but it is for people who don't know that penguins and pumas overlap,” he adds.\n\nBut the behavior changes are surprising. “We tend to think of pumas as extremely aggressive and intolerant,” Donadio says. “But when food is abundant and concentrated, there’s no need to defend it. They become more socially tolerant,” he adds.\n\n(What one photographer learned after spending nearly a year with pumas)\n\nDonadio says that, so far, surveys suggest the penguin colony has remained stable or even increased since the park was created. What remains uncertain is how the penguin-driven changes in puma behavior ripple through the rest of the ecosystem—especially to guanacos, Patagonia’s dominant herbivore, and the pumas’ primary traditional prey.\n\nDespite the behavioral shifts documented in the study, some important questions remain. The researchers still don’t know how many penguins individual pumas kill, making it difficult to assess the long-term impact of predation onthe colony, even though penguin numbers at Monte León appear stable or increasing so far. Nor can they yet determine whether the high puma density is a temporary or a long-term feature of the ecosystem.\n\nAlso, researchers still have to figure out the broader ecological consequences of penguin-driven changes in puma behavior. “We know that the penguin colony has changed where, when, and how pumas obtain their food, but the next step is to understand the ecological implications of that change,” Serota says.\n\nFor now, the puma behavior findings demonstrate that when nature is given space, it does not always look back—it improvises. “Restoration doesn’t mean going back to some historical snapshot,” Serota says. “Species are returning to ecosystems that have changed dramatically. That can create entirely new interactions.”\n\nThe nonprofit National Geographic Society, committed to illuminating and protecting the wonder of our world, funded Explorer Emiliano Donadio's work. Learn more about the Society’s support of Explorers.",

    "fullText": "If I could use only one word to encapsulate Terminator 2D: No Fate, it would be \"authentic\": Both in the way it faithfully recreates James Cameron's seminal 1991 action movie and its nostalgic love affair with the 16-bit era of video games. Movie tie-ins were mostly awful in the early '90s, but I could easily see myself renting No Fate from my local Blockbuster and blasting through its sidescrolling run-'n'-gun action in between episodes of Dragon Ball Z and WWF Smackdown.\n\nIt's a brief experience, with the credits arriving in less time than it takes to watch the entirety of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but No Fate is a licensed video game done right, created with palpable reverence for both its source material and the era of video games it emulates.\n\nNo Fate's story mode opens with a shot of rolling tarmac, as the painted yellow lines in the middle of the road scroll past at regular intervals. If you're a fan of Terminator 2, this shot will be a familiar sight, albeit one now rendered in gorgeous pixel art, with chiptune music and Sarah Connor's monologue presented as blocks of text rather than through Linda Hamilton's hushed tones. It's also in a different place--on a desert road instead of a Los Angeles freeway--and opens the game as opposed to bookending the movie.\n\nWhere it once wrapped up two hours of pure movie-making excellence with a hopeful glimpse of an undetermined and hopefully better future, No Fate warns of the horrors to come--of Judgment Day and the rise of the machines. It's a scene that wonderfully captures the vibe of Terminator 2 while also putting developer Bitmap Bureau's own spin on things, remaining authentic and faithful to the source material with an additional sprinkling of unique flavor on top.\n\nThis is a common theme throughout No Fate's story mode. When it's not a beat-by-beat 16-bit recreation of one of the greatest movies ever made, it's filling in the blanks and professing its love for '90s gaming, fluidly shifting gameplay styles to suit the adaptation's needs.\n\nTake the opening level as a prime example: In a new scene set shortly before the film's events, Sarah is teaching John Connor how to fight so he can become the soldier he may need to be in the future. This moment of atypical bonding is interrupted when a musclebound thug pays homage to Double Dragon by punching John in the gut and flinging him over his shoulder before walking off. What follows is a side-scrolling action platformer with more than a few similarities to the console and early arcade games of the '90s.\n\nAs you move Sarah from left to right, mowing down bad guys by shooting vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, games like Metal Slug, Super Star Wars, and RoboCop Versus The Terminator come to mind. Movement is responsive, and human enemies go down in a couple of shots, making for some satisfyingly fast-paced action.\n\nAfter rescuing John, Sarah heads to a Cyberdyne research lab to destroy it, only to be shot, arrested, and sent to the Pescadero mental hospital: a moment mentioned briefly in the film but afforded more prominence here. With Sarah's plans to prevent Judgment Day foiled, No Fate takes inspiration from Terminator 2's explosive opening scene, putting you in control of a grizzled John Connor as he leads the resistance in the Future War of 2029.\n\nThese levels resemble Konami's Contra series more than anything, right down to a familiar defensive wall boss fight and temporary weapon pickups that grant homing plasma rounds and split shot fire. Bitmap Bureau introduces a few modern wrinkles as well, such as the ability to take cover and an evasive roll for avoiding enemy fire, though the game gets more interesting once you're done destroying the various T-800s, Centurions, and Hunter-Killers of Los Angeles' future.\n\nOnce John reaches the time-travel device and sends a T-800 back to 1995, No Fate transitions to Arnold Schwarzenegger's first appearance in Terminator 2 as he emerges in the parking lot of The Corral biker bar--though it's worth noting that Arnie's likeness isn't included, despite Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, and Robert Patrick all starring. From here, the game begins taking scenes from the film and transforming them into playable levels, nailing every memorable moment while adapting gameplay styles to fit each scene.\n\nAfter a naked Arnie asks for a biker's clothes, boots, and motorcycle, No Fate momentarily turns into a beat-em-up as you clobber The Corral's patrons, throwing one onto a steaming hot grill and culminating in a boss fight set to George Thorogood's \"Bad to the Bone.\"\n\nLater on, the iconic motorcycle/truck pursuit through Los Angeles' flood-control channel draws inspiration from Battletoads' Turbo Tunnel and the bike level from Contra 3: The Alien Wars, challenging you to avoid static hazards while keeping Robert Patrick's T-1000 at bay--complete with one-handed shotgun reloads that are still the coolest. The freeway chase from later on in the film functions similarly but differs slightly, as you alternate between weaving in and out of traffic and taking control of Sarah as she fires upon the pursuing T-1000-manned helicopter.\n\nSarah's escape from the Pescadero Hospital is another highlight, briefly turning No Fate into a stealth game. With the T-1000 hot on your tail, passing through metal bars and melting into the floor, there's a sudden injection of tension since you have no way of fighting back. Instead, you need to duck into doorways and various alcoves to avoid the T-1000 and bide your time before taking out the hospital's abusive orderlies. There isn't an instant fail state if you alert any of the human enemies; it's just easier to take them out with a swift blow to the back of the head, so being spotted is never frustrating.\n\nThis level fits the era, too, even if you might not necessarily think of stealth mechanics when recalling 16-bit games. 1990's Bonanza Bros was the primary inspiration behind No Fate's stealth mechanics, but games like Rolling Thunder and Elevator Action Returns were also influential, showcasing the depth of Bitmap Bureau's love for the era.\n\nWhile your first venture through No Fate's story mode covers the rest of Terminator 2, from blowing up Cyberdyne HQ to fighting off the T-1000 in the steel mill finale, subsequent playthroughs allow you to change the future. After all, the game's title comes from the famous line \"there's no fate but what we make for ourselves.\" The future isn't predetermined, and so the game leans into this ethos, letting you make a couple of different choices to alter events and unlock three alternative endings.\n\nIn practice, however, this sounds more interesting than it actually is. The branching paths introduce a few new levels, including an escape from a police station that feels like an ode to the original 1984 Terminator, but the other endings are brief and, much like the ending in the film's extended cut, can't compare to the original.\n\nAlong with a ranking system, global leaderboards, multiple difficulty settings, and other unlockable modes, seeking out the other three endings adds some replayability to what is otherwise a remarkably short game. My first playthrough took 42 minutes, with that number decreasing with each subsequent completion. The other modes include a Boss Rush, where you try to defeat all of the game's bosses as quickly as possible, and an Infinite mode that tasks you with walking down an endless corridor, killing as many enemies as you can to achieve the highest score. If you're interested in leaderboards, you might get some longevity out of these modes, but otherwise, you'll likely play each of them once just to unlock the rest of the modes.\n\nArcade mode adds an extra challenge by removing continues, while Mother of the Future condenses the story mode to only Sarah Connor's levels, with completion unlocking the hardest difficulty setting. The options are nice, but still just offer different ways to replay the same game. No Fate's brevity is fitting for a time period where most games had to be finished in a single sitting, but if you have no intention of elongating the experience by unlocking every mode, it's unlikely you'll be completely fulfilled.\n\nThose with few qualms about duration will find a game made with evident love and affection for both the source material and the moment in time it was released. Its music is excellent--with perhaps the best rendition of the Terminator 2 theme to date--aiding the game's visuals in its mission to transport you back to a time when blowing into cartridges and inserting coins were the norm. Whether it's the T-1000's haunting fluidity of movement, Sarah Connor's one-armed reloading of a pump action shotgun, or the way the T-800 clambers onto the hood of a semi-truck to unload an entire magazine into its windshield, Terminator 2D: No Fate recreates the movie's most memorable moments with pitch-perfect authenticity. It's a shame it ends far too soon, but this is still the definitive Terminator 2 video game.",

    "description": "Steam Replay for 2025 is now available, giving players a fun way to look back at their year in gaming. It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025.\nValve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games.",

    "fullText": "Fallout returns with a new journey into the Mojave Wasteland.\n\n on December 16, 2025 at 6:00PM PST\n\nSPOILERS for Fallout Season 2 Episode 1: The Man Who Knew to follow:\n\nThe last time we saw Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), The Ghoul aka Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins), and beloved pup CX404, their situation looked dire.\n\nLucy had learned her father Hank (Kyle MacLachlan) was responsible for the destruction of Shady Sands, The Brotherhood of Steel was in a heated battle with the New California Republic over control of Griffith Observatory, and Cooper realized that Hank held the answers to the whereabouts of his family. While Hank slipped out in the ensuing chaos and headed to New Vegas, Lucy decided to join Cooper in his quest for answers, which led them into unknown and dangerous territory.\n\nThe first episode of Fallout Season 2, \"The Man Who Knew,\" opens with a brief Pre-War flashback that shows the public protesting against RobCo industries. The scene then takes us inside a bar where a mysterious stranger (Justin Theroux) manages to taunt a group of unemployed workers about how RobCo industries founder Mr. House is more powerful than the government. They then follow him outside, where he attaches a device to the back of one of their heads in return for millions of dollars. Using this device, he’s able to command the man to attack his friends with a baseball bat, but when the mind-controlled man begins to turn against the mysterious stranger, the device makes his head explode in gory fashion.\n\nJumping back to the present, we see that Cooper is captured in Novac by the Great Khans, one of the factions running rampant in the Mojave Wasteland. But when they’re about to execute him, Lucy reveals herself in an iconic sniper perch from Fallout: New Vegas and exposes their plan to rob the Khans of their bottlecaps. She fails a dialogue check and chaos ensues; Cooper is forced to intervene in bloody fashion, reminding audiences once again why he’s one of the best gunslingers in the Wasteland.\n\nIt’s not long after this fight that Cooper reveals that New Vegas survived The Great War, thanks to a missile system designed by Mr. House, which shot the bombs out of the sky. This includes a brief pre-war flashback in which Cooper learns of Vault-Tec and House’s plans for The Great War. He struggles to get his daughter to safety.\n\nChecking in on the residents of Vault 33 in the present, we find Overseer Pearson (Leslie Uggams), who mentions that the vault's water purification chip is broken. Meanwhile, in Vault 32, Stephanie Harper (Annabel O’Hagan) is adjusting to her new life as Overseer and dealing with the needs of her residents and new arrivals from Vault 33. By her side, with child in hand, is Chet (Dave Register), Lucy’s cousin, who is struggling to adjust to his new role as the stepfather of Stephanie’s baby, and dismayed at the mere suggestion that the child be named “Chet Jr.”\n\nFinally, we cut to Vault 31, where Norm (Moises Arias), Lucy’s brother, is held captive by the robo-brain of Bud Askins, a junior vice president of Vault-Tec Industries, after discovering the vault is secretly housing the Vault-Tec executives from before The Great War.\n\nLucy and Cooper continue to follow the trail of dead bodies left in Hank’s wake. They come across a Starlight Drive-In that’s secretly housing Vault 24. Upon further inspection, they find the vault door has been opened and the inside is covered with overgrown vegetation.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper head inside, we get a Pre-War flashback of Cooper reporting his Vault-Tec findings to Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury), who led the NCR during the battle of Griffith Observatory. Moldaver reveals to Cooper that his wife plans to sell Cold Fusion, an infinite power source, to Mr. House. That and his anti-bomb missile system will make him one of the most powerful men in the world once the bombs drop. Knowing this can’t happen, she asks Cooper to assassinate Mr. House--an event we know now never comes to be).\n\nBack in Vault 31, Norm is growing weaker and weaker from a lack of food and water. Bud offers him salvation in the form of going into Hank’s now-empty cryo chamber. With time running out and with few options, Norm decides to make a rash decision and wakes up all the Vault-Tec executives from their slumber. We see the massive number of chambers begin to open up.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper explore Vault 24, they come across numerous communist corpses and find Russian propaganda playing. Lucy realizes the corpses are actually Americans who were being brainwashed to become communists, possibly as a result of one of Vault-Tec's many sick experiments on vault-dwellers. Deeper in the vault, they find a Great Khan with a mind control device similar to the one the mysterious stranger used at the start of the episode. He delivers a message for Lucy straight from her father: “I fix everything. Go home, Sugar Bomb.” Before they can react, his head explodes into gory viscera.\n\nElsewhere, Hank arrives at a secret Vault-Tec facility and changes out of his stolen power armor into something a bit more business appropriate. After enjoying a damn fine cup of coffee, he begins to record a message for an unknown recipient, promising that his work will continue. In a display case is the mysterious stranger’s mind control device with what looks like smaller and smaller upgraded models alongside it, ending the episode.\n\nFallout returns with a bang! While we got answers about the aftermath of the battle for Griffith Observatory, the quest into the Mojave Wasteland provides even more mysteries. What’s Hank truly up to? What will happen to Norm when all of the Vault-Tec executives wake up? Why is New Vegas so important? Who is the mysterious stranger who created the mind control device? We didn’t even get an update on Maximus (Aaron Moten) and the Brotherhood of Steel. So while we rejoined our comrades in this exciting new setting, there’s still plenty more to discover as we dive deeper into Fallout Season 2.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Its capital city is home to 23 million.\n\nFor context, the population of Liverpool is just under one million.\n\nCome to appreciate that and only then do you begin to understand the scale of national fury that followed when Mohamed Salah gave his incendiary interview on 6 December, claiming Liverpool had \"thrown him under the bus\".\n\n\"This interview was like a revolution in Egypt,\" says Diaa El-Sayed, the former Egypt assistant coach, who has known Salah since he was 16.\n\n\"99% of Egypt supports Salah, and you can see from the reaction at Anfield that the Liverpool fans support him too.\"\n\nAcross British media, Salah was criticised heavily for his actions.\n\nFormer Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher branded the interview a \"disgrace\" and accused the 33-year-old of throwing the club under the bus.\n\nOthers insisted Salah was in the wrong for airing his grievances in public. Yet in Cairo, the 'Egyptian King' can do no wrong.\n\n\"Before Salah, no-one supported Liverpool here,\" says Noura Essam, a Cairo local. \"Before Salah, we didn't have a global figure, so we will always support him.\"\n\nDuring the 2018 presidential election, more than one million Egyptians crossed out the names of the listed candidates and cast their vote for Salah.\n\nHe is an unofficial leader.

    "fullText": "Over the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T. Klare, Katha Pollitt, Amy Littlefield, Gregg Gonsalves, and Sasha Abramsky take on the Trump family’s corruption, set the record straight about Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",
