    "fullText": "Manchester United’s game against Bournemouth on Monday resembled a boxing match at times, with both sides trading blows, as a thoroughly entertaining encounter ended 4-4.\n\nIt was great for the neutrals, not so much for Ruben Amorim, as he saw his team relinquish their lead on three separate occasions.\n\nThe lack of control in midfield saw the head coach sub off Casemiro, despite his goal in the first half. He received a caution which will rule him out of next weekend’s clash against Aston Villa.\n\nThe Brazilian usually runs out of gas in games, as evidenced by the fact that he has played the full 90 minutes only three times this term.\n\nThe 33-year-old has managed to win over Amorim, but not INEOS, who have decided against triggering the one-year extension option in his current deal.\n\nThe Red Devils remain open to offering the Brazil international a new deal, but on lower wages, something the former Real Madrid superstar might not agree to.\n\nHe is free to agree a new pre-contract with foreign clubs from January, and plenty of Saudi Pro League sides remain interested.\n\nThey can offer the five-time Champions League winner bucket loads of cash, but as per The Daily Mail, the defensive midfielder looks to be headed across the Atlantic instead.\n\nThe report states that even if United were to offer him a new deal, a move to the MLS (Major League Soccer) seems to be his most likely destination.\n\n“Casemiro is United’s highest earner on £375,000 a week, and the club have so far shown little interest in triggering a one-year extension as they look to drive down the wage bill.\n\n“Unless that situation changes, the Brazil star will be out of contract on June 30 and free to speak to foreign clubs over a summer move in just 16 days’ time.\n\n“One option would be for United to offer Casemiro a new contract on less money, after he re-established himself as a starter alongside Fernandes this season.\n\n“Otherwise, Confidential understands Major League Soccer in the US is emerging as the most likely destination for the former Real Madrid man, who cost United £70m when he arrived from the Bernabeu on a four-year deal in 2022.”\n\nCasemiro has worked hard to establish himself as a starter under Amorim, and losing his experience and winning mentality will be a huge blow.\n\nBut the Old Trafford side needs fresh legs, and hopefully, INEOS can find a suitable replacement before letting the midfield stalwart go. Or else, Amorim will be fuming.\n\nFeature image Stu Forster via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nIn an era where international talent is at an all-time high, it might be hard to believe that it’s only been just over two decades since Utah’s Andrew Bogut became the first foreign-born winner of the John R. Wooden Award.\n\nBogut’s 2004-05 sophomore campaign with the Utes placed him into an exclusive club of college basketball history, as he led the program to the Sweet 16 in the years immediately after longtime head coach and program builder Rick Majerus left the program and received consensus national player of the year honors as a result.\n\nIn the Utes’ first season under Ray Giacolletti, Bogut averaged 20.5 points and 12.2 rebounds per game to lead the team to a 25-4 regular season record overall, with a 13-1 mark in Mountain West play. Bogut’s most impressive outing of the season was a 31-point, 13-rebound clinic in a 71-62 conference win over Wyoming on Valentine’s Day, where he made 11-of-16 attempts from the field.\n\nThe Utes would eventually fall to New Mexico in the 2005 Mountain West championship game, but still received a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament as an at-large. Bogut continued his dominance in the first round of March Madness, pouring in 24 points on 9-of-13 shooting to lead Utah over a feisty No. 11 seed in UTEP before beating No. 3 seed Oklahoma in the Round of 32.\n\nIn the days after Bogut’s college career ended with a loss to Kentucky in the 2005 Sweet 16, he was awarded the Wooden Award with a decisive finish in the voting ahead of Duke’s JJ Redick and Illinois’ Dee Brown. Being from Australia, Bogut wasn’t too familiar with Coach Wooden’s legacy when he won the award but he still cherished the honor all the same.\n\n\"I'd heard the name before. College basketball isn't very big in Australia,\" Bogut told the Associated Press after winning the award in 2005. \"He's a legendary coach -- one of the best of all-time … It's very special just to have my name engraved on that trophy with the likes of Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan.”\n\nBogut joined another very exclusive club in basketball history a few months later, as the Milwaukee Bucks selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. Bogut played 14 seasons in the NBA, winning a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015 in addition to earning third-team All-NBA honors with the Bucks in 2010.",

    "description": "There’s a good reason why neutrals watching the game on Sunday were rooting for Sunderland and not the Saudi Boys from up the road…",
    "fullText": "Days like Sunday don’t come along very often, but when they do, you are reminded of why you love your team and you love football.\n\nSunderland were absolutely outstanding against Newcastle in the first Premier League meeting in a decade, and whilst it wasn’t a startling game of football, there can be no doubt that the Lads in red and white were deserved winners and looked more than good enough value for the three points. The fact that there doesn’t seem to be a Newcastle pundit doing anything other than admit they were rightful losers says it all.\n\nIt was one of the most determined and spirited defensive displays that I’ve seen from any Sunderland side, and every single person watching could see that this is a special team that is determined to fight every single second for the supporters and the badge. When you think about the derby games and how you want your team to play, I think what we got from our lads is exactly what you’d want — they were mean, aggressive, understood the importance of the occasion, and they delivered the type of performance that makes you proud.\n\nIt feels poetic to me that in the last decade Sunderland have been relegated twice, spent four seasons in League One, have almost gone bust, had to completely rebuild ourselves, and still we’re superior to our neighbours up the road who sold their souls to the devil – the ultimate price for “success”.\n\nAnd for what? Nobody likes them.\n\nNo neutral watching that game wanted to see Newcastle United emerge victorious. Their arrogance and delusion has annoyed everyone the length and bredth for the country — no matter what the mags might believe in their own heads, they are no one’s second favourite team. They’re a laughing stock, and to lose in the manner that they did has led to widespread piss-taking for good reason… people want to see them with egg on their faces, and I’m not just talking about those of a red and white persuasion.\n\nSunderland have gone about their business in a fashion that has rightly earned us praise and acclaim. You watch players like Robin Roefs, Noah Sadiki, Omar Alderete, Dan Ballard, Reinildo Mandava, and Granit Xhaka and you can’t help but love them. Every fan of every team wants players who “get it”, and Sunderland’s players certainly do – it’s just such an amazing time to support this unbelievable football club, and the way they keep on delivering results and creating great moments for us supporters really is a sight to behold.\n\nSunday’s game was my favourite derby victory of all time — though, the 3-0 at St James’ Park under Gus Poyet does run it close. There is no sweeter feeling, after taking unrelenting and deserved stick for the last god knows how long from fans of “the Visitors”, than to be able to sit here knowing we are better than they are, that we beat them, and that we are above them in the table. I am going to be smiling ear to ear for the rest of this week!",

    "fullText": "Jalen Brunson didn’t have his best scoring night on Tuesday, but it didn’t matter.\n\nThe Knicks received contributions from up-and-down their bench as they pulled out a thrilling victory over the San Antonio Spurs to secure their first NBA Cup title.\n\nBrunson was named the tournament MVP, but he was sure to tip his cap to his teammates afterwards.\n\n“Without them, we don’t hold that trophy,” he said.\n\nIt starts with OG Anunoby, who led the way offensively with a game-high 28 points.\n\nAnunoby also continued his stellar all-around play on the other end of the floor, reeling in nine rebounds and earning himself Defensive Player of the Game honors.\n\n“The way he’s shooting the ball is fantastic,” Brunson said. He’s making plays and he has confidence -- when everyone is working on their game even in-season that confidence stays, so it’s a credit to him and what he’s been doing.”\n\nIt wasn’t just Anunoby, though, as big man Mitchell Robinson also stepped up with 18 outstanding minutes off the bench while Karl-Anthony Towns battled through some bruises.\n\nRobinson set an NBA Cup Final record with 10 offensive boards, and reeled in 15 in total.\n\n“That’s what Mitch does,” Towns said. “I knew playing against him just how much he impacts the game, to be his teammate now and to see what he does, he’s impacted the game how many times -- shoutout to Mitch, hell of a day at the office.”\n\nJordan Clarkson had another strong scoring night with 15 big points off the bench, but it was youngster Tyler Kolek who took advantage of the opportunity the most and truly shined on the biggest stage.\n\nKolek was leaned on heavily down the stretch and he finished with 14 points, five rebounds, five assists, and turned the ball over just once over his 20 minutes of action.\n\nIt was arguably one of his most impressive at the NBA-level.\n\n“He played big-time, I’m very happy for him,” Brunson said. “It may be a surprise to a bunch of people, but many of you see how hard this kid works and I’m just very happy for him. The way he played tonight helped us for sure, we needed him.”\n\nThe hope is that this success in big minutes can help the rest of the way in the regular season.\n\n“In a game like this where it’s basically win or go home,” the captain said. “You have guys who step up and pick up the slack for a person like me who wasn’t shooting the ball well and made a terrible second-half turnover with the back-court.\n\n“It’s when those guys come in and do that, that gives us even more confidence. That excites me more than anything, the guys who come in and do that, it gives us an opportunity to win, it’s just a great feeling.”",

    "fullText": "Bucheon FC 1995 made history, not only by winning promotion for the first time in the club's history, but also by becoming the first K League 2 side to win Promotion-Relegation Playoff 2. In other words, they became the first K League 2 side to knock off 10th in K League 1.\n\nFinishing third also means they are only the fourth team to finish outside the top two in K League 2 and win promotion, the others being Gwangju FC (4th) in 2014 and Suwon FC (3rd) in 2015, and Gangwon FC (4th) in 2016.\n\nWhat's also noteworthy about Bucheon's promotion is that they became only the third team to win both legs. But, where do Bucheon's achievements stand in the history of the playoffs? The Promotion-Relegation Playoffs began in 2013, and Sangju Sangmu were the first team to win promotion via the playoffs, while Gangwon were the first team to be relegated by them.\n\nThere have been 16 total K League 2 versus K League 1 ties (2020 had only a promotion playoff due to Sangju moving to Gimcheon). The team that won the first leg has gone on to win the tie overall on nine occasions (56%), showing just how important the first leg is.\n\nOn five occasions, this was the K League 2 team - Sangju in 2013, Gwangju in 2014, Suwon FC in 2015, Daejeon in 2022, and, of course, Bucheon in 2025.\n\nOnly two teams have won both legs before Bucheon those being Suwon FC in 2015 and Daejeon in 2022.\n\nKey: Green = K League 2 team win, orange = draw, red is K League 1 team win\n\nOnly on three occasions has the K League 2 team won the first leg and gone on to lose the tie, those being Daejeon in 2021, Busan in 2023, then Daegu last year.\n\nBut to really hammer home how special Bucheon's playoff triumph is, in the last four seasons, six out of the eight K League 1 teams have survived. Overall, seven K League 2 teams have been promoted, and nine K League 1 teams have survived.\n\nBeing only one of four teams to win promotion that finished outside the top two is no mean feat either. What history tells us about the promotion chances of the teams that don't finish first or second is that it's extremely rare.\n\nFifth only became a playoff spot in 2022 following the extension of the playoffs, from one spot to two. That year, Gyeongnam beat Bucheon but were knocked out by Anyang. In 2023, Bucheon were the away side and drew with Gyeongnam, so they were eliminated. Last year, Busan drew 0-0 away to Jeonnam and were knocked out. This season, Seongnam became the first fifth-place team to knock off fourth but were eliminated in the next phase, and no team has won promotion from fifth.\n\nIn 2022, Bucheon finished fourth, the second-to-last playoff spot, and faced Gyeongnam but lost 3-2. The following year, it was roles reversed as Gyeongnam finished fourth and Bucheon with a 0-0 draw for the Roses enough to advance, only to lose to Gimpo. Last year, Jeonnam hosted Busan and advanced via a 0-0 draw, and this year, Seoul E-Land lost 1-0 to Seongnam. No team has been promoted from this position.\n\nJeonnam Dragons finished in the last playoff spot in 2021 and went to Daejeon needing to win to advance. The game ended 0-0 and it was Daejeon who went through, eventually beating Anyang before losing to K League 1 Gangwon FC over two legs.\n\nIn 2020 the playoffs were a bit different, due to the Sangmu team moving from Sangju to Gimcheon. This meant two teams were guaranteed to go up - the K League 2 champions and the playoff winners. Daejeon finished fourth that year but drew with Gyeongnam and so were knocked out.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2021, only Gwangju in 2014 went up as the lowest-ranked team in the playoffs. Seoul E-Land (2015), Busan IPark (2016), Seongnam FC (2017), Gwangju (2018), Bucheon (2019), and Jeonnam (2021) all failed to do so.\n\nSecond-highest Ranked Playoff Spot\n\nThe second-highest ranked playoff spot would usually be third from 2014 until 2021, then fourth from 2022 onwards, and this is where Bucheon come in. From 2014 until this year, only two teams went up from this position. Suwon FC in 2015 and Gangwon in 2016. Bucheon are, therefore, one of only three teams out of 12 to finish in the second-highest playoff spot and win promotion. Gangwon (2014), Asan Mugunghwa (2017), Daejeon Citizen (2018, 2021), FC Anyang (2019, 2022), Gyeongnam (2020), Gimpo (2023), and Seoul E-Land (2024) all failed.\n\nSince 2022, finishing runner-up has meant a direct playoff with 11th in K League 1. Before that, runners-up got what the third-placed team gets now - home advantage in the K League 2 playoff final. So far, only Busan IPark (2019), Suwon FC (2020), and Daejeon (2022) have won promotion from the highest-ranked playoff spot. Ansan Police (2014), Daegu (2015), Bucheon (2016), Busan (2017, 2018, 2023), Anyang (2021), Chungnam Asan (2024), and Suwon Bluewings have all failed.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea claimed a hard-fought 3-1 win over Cardiff City yesterday. The Blues made it difficult for themselves with a poor first-half showing.\n\nHowever, manager Enzo Maresca rang the changes and the top guns came on, swinging momentum in Chelsea’s favour.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho came on from the bench and netted a double while Pedro Neto also scored a well-taken goal, earning the Blues a place in the semi-final.\n\nWhile Garnacho will likely (and rightly) take most of the plaudits, Neto deserves praise for a solid 25-minute cameo.\n\nThe Portuguese winger came on and helped Chelsea hold on to the ball. He also helped the West Londoners be more incisive, providing the cutting edge they lacked.\n\nHis performance earned him an 8/10 rating from Football London. They wrote, “The hero. His sixth goal of the season. Mr Reliable for the Blues.”\n\nNeto has been criticised by Chelsea fans for his lack of end product and decision-making in the final third, but continues to deliver the goods and shut out all the noise.\n\nHis defensive work rate and non-stop running will make him a mainstay of this Chelsea team for years to come.\n\nThe excitement of on-loan stars like Geovany Quenda and Kendry Paez has led many to believe that the Blues can do away with Neto, but he continues to prove his worth.\n\nThe West Londoners take on Newcastle United this weekend, and Neto is expected to reclaim his starting berth. He will hope to continue his excellent run of form.\n\nYoungster Estevao Willian is reportedly dealing with a muscle issue and won’t be available to provide cover for Neto.\n\nHis absence will be a massive blow for the Blues as they bid to consolidate their hold on fourth place on the Premier League table with a win over struggling Newcastle.",

    "fullText": "It’s the final group stage round of the 2025-26 season in the UEFA Women’s Champions League. Another situation in which a draw for Chelsea Women won’t suffice. The Blues must win this match if they want “smooth sailing” into the competition’s knockout rounds as they sit third in the league table, but with few points separating them from several other teams right behind them.\n\nThis pack of “chasers” includes our opponents, who are a regular thorn on our side. They might not be as much of a powerhouse as they once were. However they remain a tough nut to crack, especially when playing with home support.\n\nDate / Time: Wednesday, December 17, 2025, 20.00 GMT; 3pm EST\nVenue: AOK Stadion, Wolfsburg, Germany\nReferee: Silvia Gasperotti (on pitch); Valerio Marini (VAR)\nForecast: Cloudy\n\nOn TV: none (US); none (UK); elsewhere\nStreaming: ESPN+, Paramount+, fuboTV (US); Disney+ (UK)\n\nWolfsburg team news: It was a summer of rebuilding for the German outfit, with several key players such as defender Kathrin Hendrich, goalkeeper Merle Frohms and attacking midfielder Jule Brand leaving the club at the end of their respective contracts. To make up for these exits Wolfsburg had to go into the market, bringing in the likes of Brighton defender Guro Bergsvand and Paris FC forward Kessya Bussy to fill in the gaps.\n\nAt least fitness hasn’t been an issue for them as the hosts have no major injury concerns for the squad that will face Chelsea. Hooray!… for them.\n\nChelsea team news: Beating Brighton in a Women’s Super League match wasn’t a special occasion. It was still notable as it put Chelsea back on a winning streak, albeit a very short one, following a rather weird stretch of three winless games for the blues.\n\nThe Blues will be missing defender Nathalie Björn whose hamstring injury means she’ll be sidelined for a few weeks at least. There are good news regarding Hannah Hampton with the goalkeeper listed in the squad that travelled to Germany. But according to Sonia Bompastor she remains happy with her immediate substitute, Livia Peng.\n\nPreviously: Superb efficiency in front of goal gets us a 3-0 win over the German side at their turf.",

    "title": "Sienna Betts makes her college debut for No. 4 UCLA in 87 point blowout of Cal Poly",
    "description": "Freshman forward Sienna Betts, sister of Lauren Betts, made her long awaited debut in a historically high scoring game by the Bruins.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - No. 4 UCLA had by far their best scoring game of the season Tuesday night when they took to the court against the Cal Poly Mustangs and turned in one of their best defensive performances too, finishing the game with a massive 115-28 final score in favor of the Bruins.\n\nIt was UCLA's first triple digit finish of the season and the 87 point margin of victory was the fourth-largest in program history and the largest in the NCAA era.\n\nWhat made the Bruins eclipsing the 100-point threshold that much more impactful was the player who did it. With just under seven minutes to go, freshman forward Sienna Betts spun, stepped back and sank a midrange shot for her fifth point of the game and UCLA's 101st.\n\nBetts, the younger sister of superstar UCLA senior center Lauren Betts, made her long-awaited debut Tuesday night after being kept out of the season so far with an injury. She was subbed in midway through the first quarter and Pauley Pavilion roared as over a month of anticipation was finally released.\n\nFor the Betts sisters, it was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.\n\n\"I just felt super jolly. I was just so happy to be on the court with her. She's just done a lot of work and I know that this process hasn't been easy, but just to have that moment with her, this is something that we've grown up dreaming about, so to be at this level and to be on the court with her is really amazing.\"\n\nIt's been a long road to this point for the younger Betts. Close has spoken at length this season about the drive that Betts has and the disappointment that Betts has felt not being able to be on the court. Still just a freshman, that intense drive can be a spark plug for success, but it can also be straining mentally. Close has made it an important mission to guide Betts through that, and reminding her not only of her talent, but of her value both as a person and a player.\n\n\"I know who Sienna Betts is and I know how good she's going to be,\" head coach Cori Close said at halftime. \"I just want her to give herself some grace right now. She's trying to do everything all at once. She has done a heck of a job in how she's returned to play, what's she's been learning... how she will continue to improve even though it's not the way she wanted too or planned.\"\n\nNow that her first game is behind her, one of two things can happen for Betts. Either the pressure is off her shoulders and she can simply focus on moving forward, or the liklier option, she'll ramp up the intensity as much as she can now that she's got a taste of college ball.\n\n\"Sometimes an overused strength becomes a weakness. And her strength is  she demands a very high level of herself all the time. But, when you over use that or it gets out of balance it can also hold you back. So, I'm encouraging her to think about process, encouraging her to write down all of the things she did well... She made so many maturation steps over this last six or seven weeks. It's hard. If it was easy everyone would do it.\"",

    "fullText": "Braves leveraged Scott Boras' blueprint with Pete Alonso, Alex Bregman to re-sign Ha-Seong Kim originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves made the decision to claim shortstop Ha-Seong Kim off waivers during the final month of the regular season. In recent years, the shortstop position had become a weak spot for the team. Kim, however, took full advantage of his opportunity, quickly turning himself into an attractive name on the free-agent market. Kim also admitted that he enjoyed his time playing in Atlanta.\n\n“It was great. I enjoyed it in Tampa Bay, but I think I had more fun and enjoyed playing baseball in Atlanta. I'm sorry I kept feeling unwell and in pain in Tampa Bay,” Kim said.\n\nOn Monday, Kim signed back with the Braves on a one-year deal.\n\n“Shortstop Ha-Seong Kim is returning to the Atlanta Braves, agreeing Monday to a one-year, $20 million contract that addressed a major offseason priority for the team. Kim gets a $4 million raise. He had declined a $16 million player option that was in the two-year, $29 million contract he signed in February with Tampa Bay, a deal that paid him $13 million. The Braves announced the new deal with Kim on Monday night,” ESPN reported.\n\nWhile other teams reportedly offered Kim longer contracts, his agent Scott Boras focused on maximizing short-term value — and Braves general manager Alex Anthopoulos executed his strategy perfectly.\n\n“Given that teams have largely avoided the lengthy nine figure deals aside from the absolute best free agents in recent years, Boras has pivoted somewhat to having his clients start taking short-term deals over and over again to get the total amount of money they wanted from the beginning. Pete Alonso had to do it with the Mets last offseason as did Alex Bregman. That Boras has both men as clients was not an accident,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote. “In this case, the Braves knew what they wanted and they knew how they could get it from the Boras client and the team is now in much better position for it.”\n\nThe Braves have done nearly everything right this winter. After missing the playoffs last season, Atlanta has positioned itself as a legitimate threat to the Philadelphia Phillies in the NL East.\n\nAnthopoulos isn’t just playing his cards correctly with players — he’s also navigating one of the most difficult agents in baseball in Scott Boras.

    "fullText": "Manchester City welcome Brentford to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night in an all-Premier League EFL Cup quarter-final showdown.\n\nMan City booked their place in the last eight with a comfortable 3-1 win over Swansea City.\n\nWhile Premier League and Champions League success usually take centre stage at the Etihad, the EFL Cup still carries significance for Pep Guardiola’s side, given their rich history in the tournament.\n\nMan City have dominated the competition, lifting the trophy six times in eight seasons between 2014 and 2021.\n\nHowever, they have not won it since edging Tottenham Hotspur in the 2021 final and have failed to reach the quarter-finals in recent years.\n\nThat makes tonight’s contest an important marker, especially as Man City have gone on to win the trophy after each of their last six quarter-final victories.\n\nGuardiola has rotated his squad well so far, guiding Man City past Huddersfield Town and Swansea with little fuss. The hosts also head into the game on the back of five wins in a row across all competitions.\n\nMan City clinically dispatched a profligate Crystal Palace side 3-0 in the Premier League and will be confident of extending their winning streak at the expense of another London club.\n\nGuardiola is expected to name a heavily rotated side for tonight’s EFL Cup showdown, with next weekend’s home game against West Ham United in mind.\n\nJames Trafford will likely return to the XI for the first time since the 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League.\n\nThere should be changes to the backline, although Nico O’Reilly will likely reprise his role.\n\nWith John Stones struggling with injury, Nathan Ake returns to the XI for the first time in over a month.\n\nAbdulkodir Khusanov should join the out-of-favour centre-back at the heart of defence, while Rico Lewis lines up at right back.\n\nTijjani Reijnders should start at the base of midfield with Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Oscar Bobb, and Bernardo Silva ahead of him.\n\nWith Omar Marmoush jetting off to the Africa Cup of Nations, Erling Braut Haaland should lead the line.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City welcome Brentford to the Etihad Stadium with a place in the Carabao Cup semi-final on the line. For Man City, this competition carries added edge after a trophyless 2024-25 campaign, a rare blank year by their recent standards. For Brentford, it represents another chance to test themselves against elite opposition, having already shown their appetite for cup football this season.\n\nBoth sides arrive with reasons for optimism, but also with clear obstacles to overcome as the margins tighten at the quarter-final stage.\n\nMan City are eight-time winners of the Carabao Cup, yet have not reached the final four since lifting the trophy in 2020-21. That gap feels longer than it is, largely because of the club’s relentless domestic dominance elsewhere. Pep Guardiola has already rotated heavily in earlier rounds, navigating past Huddersfield and Swansea without fuss.\n\nThis match fits a familiar pattern for Man City, a demanding league schedule balanced against a cup competition that often doubles as a testing ground for squad depth. Guardiola has confirmed rotation again, which opens doors for players such as John Stones, while others are likely to be protected with bigger targets in mind. Even so, the underlying expectation remains unchanged, control the game, limit chaos, and let quality decide.\n\nBrentford’s route to this stage has been anything but gentle. They edged past Bournemouth, survived a penalty shootout against Aston Villa, and then swept aside Grimsby 5-0, a side who had earlier stunned Manchester United. That run highlights Brentford’s ability to raise their level in knockout football, particularly away from home.\n\nHowever, history offers limited comfort. Brentford have lost their last two Carabao Cup quarter-finals and have only once reached the semi-final of this competition. Trips to the Etihad rarely forgive defensive lapses, and their Premier League away form remains a concern despite two Carabao Cup wins on the road this season.\n\nMan City remain without Jeremy Doku, who is sidelined by a leg injury, while Rodri is not expected back in time after his hamstring issue. Mateo Kovacic continues his recovery, and Africa Cup of Nations duty rules out Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri. Erling Haaland has not featured in the competition so far and could again be rested.\n\nBrentford are also affected by AFCON, with Dango Ouattara and Frank Onyeka unavailable. Fabio Carvalho, Antoni Milambo and Josh Dasilva remain long-term absentees, while Reiss Nelson is a doubt. There is better news in attack, with Kevin Schade poised to return after suspension.\n\nBrentford have a habit of making Man City uncomfortable, often pressing with bravery and directness. Yet the Etihad presents a different challenge altogether, especially against a Guardiola side determined to avoid another cup exit.\n\nPrediction: Man City to win 2-1.",

EU officials say changing the limit will not affect progress toward making the 27-country bloc's economy climate neutral by 2050. That means producing only as much carbon dioxide as can be absorbed by forests and oceans or by abatement methods such as storing it underground.

    "fullText": "The US government is launching an early career hiring and talent development program to bring more technology and artificial intelligence employees to the public sector, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to modernize government systems and stay ahead in the global tech race.\n\nThe launch of the “US Tech Force” is designed to address a technical and early career talent gap across the government, according to Scott Kupor, the director of the Office of Personnel Management which is spearheading the program. The effort comes amid a broader war for AI talent, with tech companies offering sizable salaries and other perks to attract top engineers and researchers.\n\nOPM plans to hire an initial cohort of 1,000 early career software engineers, data scientists, project managers and AI experts to be placed across government agencies for the two-year program. It will also partner with tech companies to recommend early career managers to take a leave of absence from their private-sector roles to join the Tech Force.\n\n“If you’re thinking about, long term, a career in technology, there is no bigger and more complex set of problems than we face in the federal government,” Kupor said in a call with reporters ahead of the program’s announcement Monday.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to implement AI to modernize and make more efficient systems across the federal government, including with the controversial Department of Government Efficiency. That effort, launched under Elon Musk earlier this year, is no longer operating as a “centralized” organization, officials said last month.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in July also signed an AI action plan, a set of initiatives and policy recommendations that centered on growing US AI infrastructure and scaling back regulation to promote US competitiveness.\n\nMembers of the new US Tech Force will work directly for individual agencies on projects determined by agency leadership. OPM will conduct an initial review and technical assessment of applicants and recommend approved candidates to agencies for final interviews and hiring decisions.\n\nApplications open Monday, and OPM hopes to have most members of the first cohort placed in roles within the first quarter of 2026.\n\nMembers of the Tech Force are expected to work on projects such as incorporating advanced AI into drones and other weapons at the Department of Defense, building out the Trump Accounts platform at the Internal Revenue Service, and using AI to improve intelligence at the State Department, among other initiatives, according to Kupor.\n\nThroughout the two-year program, OPM plans to bring in Silicon Valley CEOs and other executives for speaker events. It will also partner with around 25 tech companies to provide mentorship and career planning advice to members of the cohort. Microsoft, Adobe, Amazon, Meta and xAI are among the companies that have signed on as partners of the program.\n\nThe program will conclude with a job fair, where program members will have access to both public- and private-sector opportunities. Salaries for members of the Tech Force are expected to range from approximately $130,000 to $195,000.\n\n“There is an incredible race for talent in these areas … so part of what we want to do is be competitive on compensation,” Kupor said. He added that he wanted potential applicants to “understand that in doing this, they’re going to learn a bunch, they’re going to tackle really complex problems, and then they can ultimately go back to the private sector, if that’s what they want to do, and certainly will have the opportunity to maximize their financial opportunity as a result.”",

For the same exact clusters measured in the same period, using the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) AQI, seen on the right, will show mostly orange and red. These represent “unhealthy for sensitive groups” or generally “unhealthy” air, signalling a significantly higher level of concern.\n\nHere we can see the difference between the categories of these two AQIs – India’s NAQI on the left, and the US AQI on the right. NAQI’s “good” and “satisfactory” standards cover two separate categories, seen here on the AirGradient map legend in two shades of green. For those without a careful eye for detail, this can make a “satisfactory” cluster be mistaken for a “good” one.\n\nThis further highlights the difficulty of comparing cross-country indices; greens, oranges, and reds don’t automatically correspond, and can even be split within one index.\n\nIn its 2021 air quality guidelines, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that a 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration above 15 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) is already beyond its recommended limit. India’s system, in contrast, sets the comparable 24-hour threshold of PM2.5 at 60 µg/m3, which is four times higher.\n\nHowever, India is far from being alone in exceeding this limit. China sets its limit at 75 µg/m3, the European Union at 50 µg/m3, the US at 35 µg/m3, and Canada at 28 µg/m3, just to name a few.\n\nFrom a health perspective, the implications are striking: two people breathing air with the same level of PM2.5 in two different countries could be told very different stories about how safe that air is. This gap silently shapes how millions of people understand the air they breathe, and can influence the activities they undertake in their day-to-day lives. For example, recommendations related to prolonged and strenuous outdoor activities are particularly important, seeing as exercise poses additional health risks due to the increased uptake and deposit of pollutants in the lungs.\n\nAfter all, WHO guidelines remain advisory, and hence, governments have no legal obligation to abide by them. However, they are formulated by expert committees with the aim of informing local policymaking.\n\nFirstly, there’s a technological disparity to note, as countries use different types of reference grade monitors as the ‘official’ norm, which measure air pollution differences. India’s official monitors use beta attenuation monitors (BAMs), which physically weigh particles and require regular maintenance and biyearly calibration, whereas many private platforms use low-maintenance sensor-based devices that rely on laser scattering. BAMs are more accurate and better suited for measuring higher concentrations, which fits with India’s local context. However, without the regular maintenance required, this advantage may be negated, and the accuracy of the data reported may in fact suffer.\n\nAccording to Gufran Beig, founder director of India’s national air quality monitoring system SAFAR, “every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment”. India’s Northern Plain, for example, experiences natural dust storms. These increase both coarse and fine particulate matter concentrations in the ambient air, which cause conditions to exceed the WHO limit. Adopting this standard in these locations would classify air as polluted even without human activity.\n\nThe Indian Environment Ministry raises another point regarding the need to account for “socio-economic status and national circumstances”. While the country is striving to transition towards cleaner alternatives in accordance with the National Action Plan on Climate Change, most of the energy consumed in India is derived from fossil fuels, particularly coal. Meanwhile, the combustion of coal, petrol, diesel, gas, biomass, and waste accounts for 81% of PM2.5 pollution. Therefore, reducing air pollution would logically entail targeting this sector. If India were to strictly adhere to international standards, it would require an overhaul of its energy production systems, transportation, and construction, and would incur significant job losses in the fossil fuel sector. This would impact economic growth and development goals, yielding social and political challenges.\n\nShould there be a standardized international index, or should we allow for cross-country variation?\n\nOn one hand, a stricter index aligned with WHO limits might better reflect health risks and allow for comparable scales, but would expose the severity of a problem that is expensive and politically costly to fix. On the other, a looser index can account for local contexts, and reduce public alarm and short-term political pressure. However, this may come at the cost of long-term passivity.\n\nAt AirGradient, we are grappling with this question ourselves. On our mobile app, which features a map that visualizes real-time air quality data, users can select to display values either as raw concentration values (µg/m³) or using the U.S. EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) scale.\n\nShould we also integrate other national indices such as India’s NAQI? This would allow us to reach a larger audience and adapt to what users are familiar with, but would also mean shaping norms towards an acceptance of indices that may be misinforming their users of the real health risks.\n\nYou can download the AirGradient map and test out the index displays here: App Store / Play Store\n\nCentral Pollution Control Board.

    "description": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by",
    "fullText": "Professor Gene Sharp of Southeastern Massachusetts University has given several years of study to the possibilities of deterrence and resistance by civilians as a conceivable alternative, or partial alternative, to the traditional, purely military concepts of national defense that have so long prevailed and continue to prevail in European countries. He has restricted the range of applicability of his researches and reflections to Europe, and has directed them, within those limits, primarily to the neutral countries such as Austria and Finland. But his study is intended to apply, at least hypothetically, to such other countries, now members of one or the other of the great nuclear alliances, as might in some distant future succeed in detaching themselves from the alliance in question and thus find themselves compelled to devise an independent defense policy that makes sense with regard to the military and political realities of the present day. The question addressed in this book is essentially this: Where is the peace-loving, nonaggressive, and nonaligned country to find the maximum security against outside interference and domination in a world where war itself, and therefore the traditional preparations for war, have lost so much of their rationale as instruments of national policy?\n\nThe answer in the NATO establishment (and perhaps also, although with diminished conviction and enthusiasm, in the Soviet one, too) would be: in the nuclear deterrent, of course. Either, one would say, you have your own nuclear arsenal, or you ally yourself with someone else who has one.\n\nMr. Sharp challenges (quite correctly in the opinion of this reviewer) the validity of this supposed alternative. Not only is the nuclear deterrent by its very nature dangerously unstable but it is not really a means of defense. In the concept of nuclear deterrence, Mr. Sharp notes, “the capacity to defend in order to deter has been replaced by the capability to destroy massively without the ability to defend.” Beyond this there is, for any country wishing to go the nuclear road, the necessity of choosing between the development of a nuclear arsenal of one’s own, at vast expense and in defiance of the international effort to restrict proliferation, and the acceptance of an alliance with some existing nuclear power—a relationship bound, as experience has shown, to raise the unanswerable question about whose interests, those of the protector or those of the nominally protected, are eventually to prevail in a moment of crisis so brief as to be responsive only to the impulses of the computer.\n\nFinally, as Mr. Sharp also points out, to create a nuclear arsenal or to accept someone else’s missiles on one’s own territory is to increase immensely, from a point of near zero to a very high level, the danger that in any sort of a nuclear conflict one’s own country will become a likely target. Mr. Sharp could even have strengthened his case, in this respect, by pointing out that the Soviet leaders have repeatedly and specifically affirmed that they would never use nuclear weapons against any country that did not itself deploy them or permit them to be deployed on its own territory—an assurance that deserves greater credence than it has generally received, not only because there would be no reason to put out such a statement exclusively to deceive, but also because, given the general irrationality of the nuclear weapon, that policy in question makes perfectly good sense.\n\nThus for a nonnuclear country determined to pursue an independent policy but required to live under the shadow of the nuclear competition of the two super-powers, the nuclear option is not a hopeful one. But neither, for that matter, is an exclusive reliance on the traditional concepts of defense with “conventional” weapons. In an age of long-range striking power by aircraft, by missiles, even by long-range artillery, the idea of defense at the frontier has lost its reality. Beyond that, such is now the destructive power of even nonnuclear weapons that a war fought with them, particularly a defensive war presumably conducted largely on one’s own territory, promises nothing but a degree of devastation that makes a mockery of the very idea of military victory. Here we simply get back to the fact that war, generally, as among the industrially advanced and technologically sophisticated countries, can no longer serve any useful purpose—not even that of a defense.\n\nIt did not, actually, take the post–World War II advances in weapons technology to establish this fact. It is inescapably clear that in the two great European wars of this century there were, in reality, no victors. These were, in effect, simply senseless orgies of destruction. The damages they inflicted, on the nominal victor and the defeated alike, were far greater and more insidious than people were even aware of at the time, reaching as they did into the spiritual and genetic as well as the purely military and physical realms. It is idle for the independent European country of this day to suppose that by entering into a new and even more horrible round of such carnage it could protect anything worth protecting.\n\nThese two supposed alternatives for an independent defense on the part of the unaligned Continental country are therefore, when looked at carefully, no alternatives at all. It is not surprising, in these circumstances, that people’s minds should turn to the question whether there might not be some means of defense that would at least hold out hope of avoiding the sheer physical disasters that both of these supposed alternatives invite. It is this necessity that has led to Professor Sharp’s inquiry into the possibilities and limitations of civilian-based defense; and it would be unfair to judge it in any way other than in relation to the unpromising nature of these two, and only, visible alternatives. It is worth bearing in mind, as one reads his book, that however one assesses the possibilities of civilian-based defense, the nature of the available alternatives is such that it would not take much to be preferable to them.\n\nMr. Sharp’s study addresses itself, as its subtitle (The Potential of Civilian-based Deterrence and Defence) implies, both to deterrence and to resistance if deterrence fails. The two are of course closely connected; but each requires separate treatment, and receives it.\n\nDeterrence, in this instance, is of particular importance. For the study starts, as so much conventional military thinking fails to do, from the assumption that the presumptive attacker is motivated not just by a blind urge to destroy for destruction’s sake but rather by a wholly rational desire to gain domination over the political life of the victim country and to use that domination to his own advantage. And here, of course, is where the reactions of the civilian population—its will to resist and the preparation it has been given for doing so—come in. To deny this is to fly in the face of the historical evidence. For if we consider the failure of other powers to attack Switzerland during the two world wars, the failure of the Soviet Union to occupy Finland in the wake of their conflicts during World War II, and the similar abstention by Moscow from attacking Yugoslavia after that country’s break with the Soviet Union in 1948, we can see that calculations relating to the respective country’s presumptive powers of internal resistance, while certainly not the only considerations that played a part, occupied a prominent place among those that determined the final decision.\n\nThe successful imposition of foreign domination over a given country requires the ability of the dominating power to find, from among the population of that country, a faction either so inspired ideologically or so successfully cowed as to serve as a puppet government. It then requires that this faction should have the capacity to recruit the requisite indigenous bureaucracy, and to compel the population to accept and respect its authority. But whether these conditions can or cannot be met is something that will be importantly affected by the extent and effectiveness of the training, indoctrination, and general preparation for resistance that the population has received in advance of the event. This, in turn, is something the potential aggressor is likely to have a fair idea of before he takes the decision whether or not to attack; and his decision is bound to be affected by his assessment of its importance.\n\nAs for resistance itself if deterrence fails, there are a great many possible forms of this (Mr. Sharp has himself identified nearly two hundred of them). Some of these may be overt and largely spontaneous; others require the most highly centralized leadership, training, and direction. Some are designed to have military effect; others are directed solely to civilian administration. Some require mass participation; others can be conducted only conspiratorially, by carefully selected and highly trained individuals. The mix to be chosen in any given instance must depend on the nature of the country in question and the peculiarities of the prevailing situation. To select among these, and to conduct careful advance planning and preparation for their implementation, is a function that lies at the heart of civilian-based defense as Mr. Sharp sees it; and it is precisely in this respect that his reflections are most importantly innovative.\n\nFor seldom, if ever, in the contests of the past, has there been any such thing as this careful advance preparation. The resistance movements that made themselves felt during the Second World War were almost without exception ones that had to be improvised under conditions of extreme danger and difficulty—under the eyes and guns, that is, of the occupier. There can be no doubt that had they had the sort of advance preparation this study envisages, their effectiveness would have been increased several times over. Lines of command would have been known; effective channels of communication would have existed; there would have been adequate caches of weapons and supplies; ordinary citizens would have had guidance and instruction as to how to behave; given types of action would have been rehearsed and prepared.\n\nSkeptics may point to the long endurance of the Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe as evidence of the hopelessness of civilian resistance to domination by a strong outside power. But again, what they will be citing as an example is not at all what Mr. Sharp has in mind. There was, in those instances, no possibility whatsoever for advance preparation—quite the contrary. What the Soviet authorities found before them, as their armies overran this great region, was a territory where all semblance of real indigenous authority had already been swept away by the preceding Nazi-German occupation. It is often forgotten that it was not the Russians but the Nazis who destroyed the prewar status quo in that part of the world, and with it all social and political stability. What the Russians found there was in fact a territory ideally prepared to receive just the sort of domination they were desirous of establishing—a situation, in short, just the opposite of the one Mr. Sharp has in mind when he examines the possibilities of a resistance well prepared in advance by an indigenous government enjoying the confidence of the people. For this concept, there are, in fact, few examples. It is a modern concept, addressed to the unprecedented conditions of this modern age.\n\nI am not in total agreement with all of Mr. Sharp’s argument. There are places where the emphasis, in my view, could have been usefully shifted. I would have placed more weight on highly centralized, clandestine direction, less on spontaneous mass action. I am not sure that the nature of civilian defense planning should be so widely publicized as the author of the book would seem to envisage. I am less sanguine than he is about the possibilities for demoralizing the armed forces of an intruder. But these are minor differences, particularly if we take into account the limitations Mr. Sharp has placed on his own conclusions.\n\nThere is, of course, in this endangered world, no such thing as absolute defense for anyone; and Mr. Sharp advances no claim that a civilian-based system would provide this. He does not even claim that civilian-based defense could usefully constitute the only component of an adequate defense policy. He recognizes that it might have to be combined, at one stage or another, with the actions of certain types of regular military forces. He does not even depict his own conclusions as definitive. His plea is only that civilian-based defense has a legitimate place among the options open to the sort of country he is talking about; that this place is plainly larger than has been generally supposed; and that its possibilities ought to be more carefully studied and considered than they have been in the past. His primary purpose in writing the book was, he says, “to make civilian-based deterrence and defense a thinkable policy which is recognized as meriting further research, policy studies, and an evaluation.” And for this, he makes a reasonably good case.\n\nBut he must not expect, just for this reason, that the effort to win understanding for his views will be easy going. It goes against the grain of all established strategic thinking. The professional military establishments will brush it off with incredulity, if not with contempt. It will arouse in many circles the same skepticism, and perhaps the same derision, that this reviewer brought down upon himself when he had the temerity to advance somewhat similar ideas in a widely publicized radio lecture delivered over the facilities of the BBC many years ago.\n\nBut the view advanced in this book deserves consideration, if only because of the bankruptcy of all the visible alternatives to it. It might just be that in a world where the devices of long-range military destruction have proliferated beyond all reason, the greatest security any country can hope to have, imperfect as it is, will be found to lie primarily in its confidence in itself, in its readiness to leave other people alone and to go its own way, it its willingness to accept the sort of social discipline that a civilian-based defense implies—in a stance, in other words, that offers minimal incentive to foreign military intrusion but promises to make things difficult, painful, and unprofitable for any power that decides, nevertheless, to intrude. Such principles may not be everywhere applicable. Nowhere may they be the complete answer to the problems at hand. But beggars, in this world of destructive power unlimited, cannot always be choosers. And Mr. Sharp’s approach, certainly more humane and in a small way more hopeful than many others, deserves at least to be given a hearing.\n\nTo see things in this way will require, however, a rather basic change in the view hundreds of millions of people have been taught to take of the sources of national security and of the means by which it may be usefully promoted. The new view would be one that looks primarily inward—to the quality of the respective society, to the character of its institutions, to its social discipline and civic morale, rather than outward to the effectiveness of its armed forces—for the true sources of its strength and its security. It suggests, in Mr. Sharp’s words, “the direct defense of society as such—its principles, free institutions, and liberties—rather than a futile attempt to defend territory as an indirect means to defend the society.” It raises, in fact, the question whether any society can be stronger in relation to others than it is to itself.\n\nWhat is implied here is no less than a change in political philosophy. For it taps, as Mr. Sharp says in his final passages, “a crucial insight into the nature of power”—namely, that\n\nall political power is rooted in and continually dependent upon the co-operation and obedience of the subjects and institutions of the society…. It is indeed possible for whole societies to apply that insight…against internal and foreign aggressors, and to triumph…. With effort, risks, and costs, it is possible for Europeans—and all peoples—to make themselves politically indigestible to would-be tyrants. The process has already begun.\n\nPerhaps those words overstate the case; but if so, not greatly. One ends the reading of the book wondering whether, if this change in political philosophy were to take place, it might not have wider effects than just those that relate to the concepts of national security—whether many other things might not also change, and, in the main, usefully so.\n\nGeorge F. Kennan (1904–2005) was an American diplomat, political scientist and historian.

No spam when there are no jobs.\n\nI'm Raul, the founder and curator of Calm Companies.\n\nAfter over a decade in the tech industry, working at an employee monitoring startup and getting fired for trying to create a better work culture, I started looking for companies that prioritize productivity and work-life balance over hours worked.\n\nOver the years, I've spent numerous hours researching and curating a list of companies that actually do this. And what I found is that there are only a handful of them. And interestingly enough, the smaller, profitable and bootstrapped a company is, the more likely it is to prioritize this.\n\nBack in 2021, I found my first calm company. They had no meetings, no deadlines, and no full-time employees. And it was a game changer. Working just 4 hours a day, on my own terms, I became more productive, more creative, and genuinely happier. When I needed time off, I took it—no guilt, no permission required.\n\nThings changed a lot since then, and now I'm on a journey to build my own calm company.\n\nHopefully, this tiny website can help you find your next dream job.\n\nSociety was built for thousands of years on the premise that first, we rent our time to others and, if there's some time left, we focus on ourselves.

    "title": "Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says some AI startups are wildly overpriced — and a correction is coming",
    "description": "The Google DeepMind CEO warns that some early AI startups are overvalued and the current pace of funding won't last.",
    "fullText": "Demis Hassabis has a blunt message for parts of the AI startup world: Some of this looks unsustainable.\n\nThe DeepMind cofounder and CEO said in an episode of \"Google DeepMind: The Podcast\" published Tuesday that there are likely \"bubbles\" forming in today's AI funding frenzy, particularly among early-stage startups raising money at huge valuations.\n\nSome startups \"basically haven't even got going yet,\" he said, yet are raising at \"tens of billions of dollars valuations just out of the gate.\"\n\n\"It's sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. You know, my guess is probably not, at least not in general,\" he added.\n\nHassabis drew a distinction between those sky-high seed rounds and the large tech companies pouring billions into AI infrastructure. There's \"a lot of real business\" underpinning Big Tech's valuations, he said.\n\nAI is \"overhyped in the short term\" but \"still underappreciated in the medium to long-term,\" he added.\n\nHassabis said an \"over-correction\" is imminent for any major technology shift like AI, especially when it goes from skepticism to obsession quickly.\n\n\"When we started DeepMind, no one believed in it,\" he said. \"Fast forward 10, 15 years, and now, obviously, it seems to be the only thing people talk about in business.\"\n\nThat kind of swing often pushes valuations too far and too fast. \"It's almost an overreaction to the underreaction,\" he said.\n\nHassabis also said he isn't worried about whether AI is in a bubble — he's focused on his job. Google DeepMind builds the AI models that power Google's products, including Gemini, and leads the company's frontier AI research.\n\nHassabis' comments come as AI startups continue to rake in soaring valuations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported last week that young founders — some of whom are fresh out of school — are raising millions for their AI startups. Many have dropped out to ride the AI wave, pulling in top investors and talent.\n\nA Stanford graduate dropout raised $64 million for her AI math startup earlier this year. Carina Hong, the founder of Axiom Math, even recruited top AI talent from Meta and Google Brain.\n\nThe 16 young founders Business Insider spoke with this year have secured over $100 million in funding.\n\nBut not everyone is buying the hype. Howard Marks, the cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, said on an episode of \"We Study Billionaires\" podcast published last week that investors are flocking to AI startups with little track record.\n\n\"Do you want to have a novel entrepreneurial startup pure play which has no revenues and no profits today, but could be a moonshot if it works?\" the billionaire asked.\n\n\"Or do you want to invest in a great tech company, which is already existing and making a lot of money where AI could be incremental but not life-changing? It's a choice.\"",

    "fullText": "Cate Blanchett, 56, says she doesn't skip her go-to wellness routine, even when traveling.\n\n\"It's so popular it's almost a cliché, but I do get into cold water every morning. It's a real leveler and brings me into the day with a fabulous jolt,\" Blanchett told Byrdie in an interview published on Tuesday.\n\nTo keep her complexion looking its best, Blanchett turns to a few trusted practices.\n\n\"Lymphatic drainage, lymphatic drainage, lymphatic drainage. I love a good facial massage. It's simultaneously relaxing and invigorating. A few minutes of Tai Chi. It wakes everything up,\" she said.\n\nBlanchett says the glow is enough to skip heavy makeup altogether.\n\n\"If your skin is in good shape, there's no need for a lot of cover-up. So for me, just mascara. And a fabulous lipstick,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time that the actor has spoken about her love for her icy morning routine.\n\n\"The only thing keeping me remotely sane at the moment is getting into cold water every day,\" Blanchett told The Guardian in a March interview. \"I get up and get in. Five minutes, and it just brings everything back down. Because you have to connect with where you are.\"\n\nCold plunges, also known as ice baths, have become a popular wellness trend. Once the domain of wealthy celebrities and athletes, it has gone mainstream, fueled by the growing obsession with longevity.\n\nResearch is mixed. Some studies show ice baths can ease muscle soreness after an intense workout, while others suggest they might interfere with long-term muscle growth.\n\nStill, it remains a staple in the routines of many athletes, including Stephen Curry, who told Business Insider in March that \"getting in cold tubs\" is a key part of his recovery routine.\n\n\"If I skip one of those, I feel it, and it doesn't give me the maximum recovery that I need, especially at this stage,\" Curry said.\n\nIf a cold plunge isn't an option, a cold shower might do the trick.\n\nNBA All-Star Kevin Love told Business Insider in April that he takes a cold shower for one to five minutes after waking up.\n\n\"When I need to really wake up and get that, boom, dopamine hit and be firing, I'll do that,\" Love said. \"My mind is working at a very high level as well as my body being just refreshed.\"",

Now we're doing that same run-out but for 50 times more money.\n\nWe have a clear strategy in mind - to knock Jake out asap. Then we go into normal service being resumed in 2026.\n\nAJ will fight against a world-class opponent in February and - if all goes well - he will then fight Tyson Fury.\n\nSo there's a method to this madness and taking this fight does not affect AJ's legacy. But losing to Jake or it even going the distance would.\n\nIt would be an absolute disaster and awfully embarrassing.",

My intention was to work from within to further the conservative principles in alignment with our great nation.\n\nToday, I have resigned from the Board of Trustees of the Heritage Foundation in furtherance of those same values.\n\nNo institution that hesitates to condemn antisemitism and hatred—or that gives a platform to those who spread them—can credibly claim to uphold the vision that once made the Heritage Foundation the world’s most respected conservative think tank. And, I cannot, in good conscience, remain on a board that is unwilling to confront the lapses in judgment that have harmed its credibility, its culture, and the conservative movement it once helped shape.\n\nI leave with respect for the Heritage Foundation’s past, but I cannot support the course it has chosen for its future. My commitment to the principles that brought me here remains unchanged, which is why I must now step away.\n\nAfter careful reflection, I have resigned from the Board of Trustees of The Heritage Foundation. This was not an easy decision, given my family’s long and meaningful relationship with the institution, but it was a necessary one.\n\nHeritage’s handling of recent challenges reveals a drift from the principles that once defined its leadership. When an institution hesitates to confront harmful ideas and allows lapses in judgment to stand, it forfeits the moral authority on which its influence depends.\n\nI remain committed to the ideals of the American Founding and to institutions that champion human dignity and responsible governance. But I cannot remain on a board unwilling or unable to meet this moment with the clarity and courage it requires.\n\nI step away in the hope that Heritage will regain the steadiness, discernment, and sense of purpose that once anchored its essential role in American civic life.\n\nAfter Tucker Carlson conducted a friendly interview with white nationalist leader Nick Fuentes earlier this fall, the think tank’s president, Kevin Roberts, released a fiery video defending Carlson and excoriating what he described as the “venomous coalition” criticizing him. Roberts’s handling of the situation was the subject of much scorn, including on the right, and he eventually recanted.\n\nMcCullar and Moffat’s resignations were preceded by Princeton professor and conservative elder Robert George’s departure from the Board. In a November Facebook post, George wrote:\n\nI have resigned from the board of the Heritage Foundation. I could not remain without a full retraction of the video released by Kevin Roberts, speaking for and in the name of Heritage, on October 30th. Although Kevin publicly apologized for some of what he said in the video, he could not offer a full retraction of its content. So, we reached an impasse.\n\nKevin is a good man. He made what he acknowledged was a serious mistake. Being human myself, I have plenty of experience in making mistakes. What divided us was a difference of opinion about what was required to rectify the mistake.\n\nI’m sad to be leaving the Heritage board. I have great affection and esteem for Barb Gaby, who chairs the board, and my other board colleagues. I wish them and the Heritage Foundation the very best.\n\nMy hope for Heritage is that it will be unbending and unflinching in its fidelity to its founding vision, upholding the moral principles of the Judeo-Christian tradition and the civic principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. I pray that Heritage’s research and advocacy will be guided by the conviction that each and every member of the human family, irrespective of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything else, as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, is “created equal” and “endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.”\n\nThe anchor for the Heritage Foundation, and for our Nation, and for every patriotic American is that creed. It must always be that creed. If we hold fast to it even when expediency counsels compromising it, we cannot go wrong. If we abandon it, we sign the death certificate of republican government and ordered liberty.\n\nHeritage Foundation Chief Advancement Officer Andy Olivastro told Mediaite, “We’re grateful to Abby and Shane for their service to Heritage. Going forward, we will advance bold initiatives grounded in permanent things and anchored by our Four Cornerstones: the American Family, the Dignity of Work and Future of Free Enterprise, National Security, and American Heritage and Citizenship.”\n\n“We have a responsibility to deliver for the American people, by developing serious ideas, sound policy, and practical solutions that ensure the conservative movement remains a governing majority for generations to come,” added Olivastro. “Our mission is clear: We exist to save the republic and secure it for future generations.”\n\nThe post BREAKING: Two More Heritage Foundation Board Members Resign Amid Tucker-Fuentes Fallout first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Whether it’s real estate or the stock market, the common retirement strategy is to buy early and let the value of your home or your investments grow over the long term.\n\nBut what if your home’s value, or that of your shares, has increased so much you’re afraid of a massive tax penalty if you cash in?\n\nPicture someone like Shane. He and his wife have lived in their home near Dallas for 35 years and paid it off. In that time, it has increased in value by $300,000.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThey’d like to sell their home and use the proceeds to buy a smaller condo, investing what’s left to continue funding their retirement, and hold off collecting Social Security for another couple of years.\n\nHowever, Shane is wondering about just how big the tax bill will be on $300,000 in capital gains accrued over 35 years.\n\nThe good news is that long-term capital gains come with a special tax advantage over short-term capital gains, and can play a positive role in retirement finances.\n\nIt's important to balance your various income streams and cash out your gains strategically.\n\nLong-term capital gains are earnings on investments or real estate held for at least a year and a day.\n\nAny earnings on investments held for a shorter time are classified as short-term capital gains.\n\nThere's a major difference between them when it comes to taxes. Long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates than short-term capital gains, which are taxed as ordinary income.\n\nYou can leverage the tax-advantageous aspect of long-term capital gains when it comes to drawing on your nest egg for income.\n\nThe amount of tax you pay on long-term capital gains depends on your tax-filing status and your overall income.\n\nHere’s a rundown of long-term capital gains tax rates as of 2025 at the federal level — not including state and local capital gains taxes (1).\n\nIf you’re single, your long-term capital gains tax rate will be:\n\n0% if your income is $48,350 or less\n\n15% if your income is between $48,351 and $533,400\n\n**20% **if your income is more than $533,400.",

    "fullText": "Global macro analyst Luke Gromen, long known for his bullish stance on Bitcoin (BTC) as a hedge against fiat debasement, has adopted a more cautious outlook for the near term.\n\nSpeaking during a recent podcast appearance, Gromen warned that the asset could fall toward the $40,000 range.\n\nDuring the podcast, Gromen stressed that his broader investment thesis has not changed.\n\nHe continues to believe that long-term currency debasement will push investors toward scarce assets such as gold and Bitcoin.\n\nDollar debasement is the decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power due to expanding money supply, inflation, or excessive government debt. This prompts investors to seek scarce assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or gold as protection.\n\nHowever, he now argues that gold and select equities may offer a cleaner expression of that trade than Bitcoin in the coming years.\n\n“Basically everything but gold and the dollar are likely to get waylaid,” Gromen said.\n\nGromen pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to make new highs relative to gold as a key warning sign. The absence of that breakout, he argued, suggests Bitcoin’s risk-reward profile has deteriorated.\n\nTreasury Secretary Bessent to propose major changes that could reshape crypto regulation\n\nAnalyst warns Fed’s $40B monthly Treasury buys could reprice crypto\n\nTeachers union warns new bill could put retirement savings at risk\n\nHe also highlighted a break below key long-term technical levels.\n\nAccording to Gromen, similar technical breakdowns in the recent past were followed by drawdowns, raising concerns that Bitcoin could face a deeper correction if history repeats.\n\n“When these technicals broke, each of the last three times, the median decline in Bitcoin was 65%–70% each time,” he said.\n\n\"The size it had grown in my portfolio, to me it just spoke to me a need to right-size it and substantially reduce positions. Because I think it's going a lot lower.\"\n\nAnother factor weighing on sentiment, according to Gromen, is the growing discussion around quantum computing risks. While most crypto traders consider it as a distant threat to Bitcoin’s cryptography, the topic has gained traction among investors.\n\nGromen suggested that large holders who have accumulated Bitcoin over the past decade may be increasingly inclined to hedge or trim exposure as the narrative gains visibility.\n\n“If I thought quantum was a risk I wanted to at least hedge somewhat, I would start to take some off the table,” he said, pointing to what he perceives as whale selling alongside weak price action.",

    "description": "This isn't the first time in 2025 that California has turned to drastic measures.",
    "fullText": "To prevent the spread of a serious bacterial disease that infects citrus crops, United States officials are expanding two federal quarantine areas.\n\nAs reported by the Fresh Fruit Portal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has expanded the citrus greening quarantines for two separate counties in Southern California.\n\nAPHIS is expanding the quarantined area in the Capistrano Beach area of Orange County by 29 square miles and the Murrieta area of Riverside County by 129 square miles. The announcement of the expansion follows the positive detection of citrus greening in plant tissue samples collected from locations in both Orange and Riverside Counties.\n\nAccording to APHIS, there are currently no commercial citrus trees impacted by the expansion of the quarantined area in Orange County. However, 170 acres of commercial citrus trees have now been impacted by the citrus greening quarantine in Riverside County.\n\nThe quarantine expansions are coordinated with the California Department of Food and Agriculture. They aim to contain citrus greening by restricting the movement of citrus materials within the state, aligning with 7 CFR 301.76.\n\n\"This action is necessary to prevent the spread of citrus greening to non-infested areas of the United States,\" APHIS wrote in the release.\n\nThe bacterial disease is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, an invasive insect species that was first documented in the U.S. in 1998. These invasive pests can wreak havoc on local ecosystems and economies by disrupting agricultural industries and interfering with native species.\n\nCitrus greening, in particular, can be devastating for citrus crops. It can lead to reduced yields, poor-quality fruit, and higher production costs. The bacteria can block nutrient flow in plants, stunting growth and killing roots. As noted by APHIS, there is currently no known cure for the disease.\n\nThis isn't the first time in 2025 that California has turned to drastic measures to deal with invasive insects. In September, portions of Santa Clara County were placed under quarantine by the California Department of Food and Agriculture after officials detected the invasive Mediterranean fruit fly.\n\n\"A quarantine is a way to minimize damage and stop the risk of spread by restricting the movement of fruits and vegetables,\" wrote the CDFA in a press release.\n\nDo you think fracking should be illegal in America?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "The National Weather Service in Boulder says it is increasingly confident in a high-impact wind event for Northern Colorado and the mountains on Dec. 17.\n\nDownslope winds will create critical fire danger and are increasingly likely to cause Xcel Energy to shut off electricity in the area.\n\nAs a result, several schools will be closed Dec. 17.\n\nHigh-wind warnings, watches and red flag warnings are in place across much of the state.\n\nThe National Weather Service says to expect damaging winds to blow down trees and power lines, widespread power outages and difficult travel, especially for high profile vehicles.\n\nAnd any new fire that broke out under these conditions would likely led to rapid fire growth, the warning says.\n\nThe NWS advises people to avoid outdoor burning or activities that cause sparks and to secure loose objects.\n\nThe Fort Collins area is under a high-wind warning from 11 a.m. to midnight on Dec. 17, with a red flag warning from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nWest winds of 30 to 50 mph are expected, with gusts up to 80 mph in the areas of Fort Collins, Boulder and the western suburbs of Denver.\n\nThe strongest gusts will peak in the 70-85 mph range, with gusts 50-70 mph being relatively widespread, according to the forecast.\n\nIn the mountains and foothills above 9,000 feet, the weather service has high confidence of wind gusts of 75 to 85 mph.\n\nIn the foothills and lower elevations west of Interstate 25, there is medium confidence in gusts over 75 mph.\n\nAcross the plains in the evening, there is medium to low confidence in gusts up to 60 mph.\n\nThe worst of the wind is expected in the afternoon.\n\nFor Dec. 18, weaker winds are expected with the chance for stronger downslope winds on Dec. 19, according to the NWS.\n\nXcel Energy says it is likely it will proactively shut off electricity starting at 10 a.m. Dec. 17 due to strong winds increasing the risk of damage to power lines and outages.\n\nThis would affect 50,000 customers in Boulder, Clear Creek, Jefferson, Larimer and Weld counties, which is fewer than originally expected.\n\nHowever, unplanned outages could also occur due to high winds, Xcel's website notes.\n\nIn Larimer County, Xcel's service area is a patchwork, but includes some portions of all of its communities, like Fort Collins, Loveland, Windsor, Timnath, Laporte, Wellington and Berthoud.\n\nIt could take several hours or days to restore power, Xcel said, because crews must examine and/or repair lines before they can be reenergized.\n\nXcel said it will make a decision about the shutoff no later than the morning of Dec. 17.\n\nCustomers can check the status of power on Xcel's electric outage map.\n\nXcel serves many schools in the area, and districts have announced closures or alternate schedules.\n\nIn Poudre School District, the following schools will be closed: Bethke Elementary, Timnath Elementary, Timnath Middle-High School, Red Feather Lakes Elementary, Stove Prairie Elementary and Livermore Elementary. All athletics and activities at those schools will also be canceled.\n\nAll other PSD schools remain open.\n\nIn Weld RE-4, which is the district covering Windsor and Severance schools, elementary schools will be closed and middle and high schools will operate on an alternate schedule:\n\nSchool will be canceled for students in preschool through fifth grade, and there will be no AlphaBEST programming.\n\nMiddle schools will release at 11:25 a.m. and high schools will release at 12:10 p.m. Lunch will be provided on a grab-and-go basis. There will be no afterschool practices, activities and events.\n\nColorado State University campuses are not expected to be affected by the Xcel shutoff, according to a social media post from CSU Police & Safety.\n\nOther electric providers in Larimer County are not planning proactive outages. However, one of them said outages due to wind damage are still possible.\n\nThe municipal utilities serving Fort Collins and Loveland, whose power lines are buried, say they don't expect any outages. They both get their wholesale power from Platte River Power Authority.\n\nPRPA is closely monitoring the weather event but doesn't plan a preemptive shutdown, communications supervisor Maia Jackson told the Coloradoan.\n\nJackson said PRPA has a strong vegetation management program so \"the risk of our transmission lines causing a fire remains low.\"\n\nThere are also protection systems set up to monitor the operations of the transmission lines and automatically open transmission line sections that experience fault conditions, Jackson said.\n\nFort Collins Utilities noted its electrical infrastructure is buried underground and said PRPA's investments in resiliency means a \"significantly reduced risk of wind-related disruptions.\"\n\nCity of Loveland Utilities says 87% of its power infrastructure is underground and the remaining system uses protection measures that reduce the risk of damage that can cause a fire.\n\nPoudre Valley REA supplies electricity to portions of Larimer and Weld counties, including areas like Red Feather Lakes, Livermore, Poudre Canyon, Berthoud and Windsor.\n\nPVREA says it doesn't anticipate planned outages, but high winds could cause unexpected outages.\n\nHere are links to select Northern Colorado power outage maps:\n\nThe Coloradoan will provide updates as needed regarding outages.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Collins Coloradoan: Colorado weather, wind forecast leads to school closures",

The pair, who attend The Colorado Springs School, were visiting the school for a basketball game at the time.\n\n\"We are writing to inform you of a serious situation that occurred last night during our away middle school basketball game in Elbert,\" the Elbert School District said. \"Two of our students left the Elbert campus before the game began, and their whereabouts remain unknown at this time.”\n\nAt the time, Eva and Neilliy, both middle school students, were wearing basketball clothes and backpacks, authorities said.\n\nThe Elbert County Sheriff’s Office added that a search, which involved drones, canines, ATVs and people on foot, had been conducted within a 5-mile radius of the school and was later called off for the night, CBS affiliate KCNC reported.\n\nThen, at a press conference on Tuesday, Dec. 16, Elbert County Undersheriff Dave Fisher said that the two girls were located.\n\n“They are safe, they’re cold, and they are eating breakfast,” Fisher said. Eva and Neilliy were medically evaluated and would be reunited with their families, he added.\n\nFisher said the teens showed up at a stranger's home seven or eight miles from where they disappeared on Tuesday morning. The man fed the girls, kept them warm and called the police.\n\nFisher noted that the girls were cross-country runners and that they did not have their cell phones when they disappeared. It remains unclear why they went missing.\n\n“They’re in good health now,” he said. “I think we can be thankful that they’ve been found and safe.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nDue to the search for the girls, the Elbert School District said early Tuesday morning that the school was closed. Upon the news that the two were found, the school district shared another message that read in part, “We thank our amazing community for the outpouring of support and help.”\n\nPEOPLE contacted the Elbert County Sheriff's Office and The Colorado Springs School on Tuesday for comments.",

    "description": "A new study shows which NC metro has the highest property tax burden, with homeowners paying about 3% of income — higher than Raleigh or Cary.",
    "fullText": "Even as state lawmakers weigh new property tax relief, a new SmartAsset study shows homeowners in North Carolina already pay a lighter property tax bill than many across the country.\n\nSmartAsset ranked 343 of the largest U.S. cities, including 10 cities in the Old North State, based on the percentage of homeowner income that goes to paying property taxes each year.\n\nWhile senior citizens, owner-occupants, and other groups may receive preferential tax treatment in some jurisdictions, homeowners still pay “anywhere from 1% to 10%” of their income on property taxes in the U.S., the study found. Those taxes fund local infrastructure and amenities.\n\nNorth Carolina’s cities ranked 207 or higher, somewhere in the middle between metros with the highest and lowest property tax burdens.\n\nAnother uptake: The state’s larger metros show lower rates than some smaller towns.\n\nHigh Point (No. 207) has the highest rate at 3%. Homeowners pay a median $2,501 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,618 and household income of $83,461.\n\nFayetteville (No. 237) and Greensboro (No. 238) have the second-highest rate at 2.6%. In Fayetteville, homeowners pay a median $2,125 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,492 and household income of $80,642. In Greensboro, homeowners pay a median $2,514 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,517 and household income of $95,627.\n\nDurham (No. 247) has the third-highest rate at 2.5%. Homeowners pay a median $3,443 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,986 and household income of $138,914.\n\nWilmington (No. 250), Cary (No. 254) and Raleigh (No. 257) have the fourth-highest rate at 2.4%. In Wilmington, homeowners pay a median $2,522 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,077 and household income of $103,261. In Cary, homeowners pay a median $4,265 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,477 and household income of $176,652. In Raleigh, homeowners pay a median $3,200 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,061 and household income of $134,182.\n\nConcord (No. 269), Charlotte (No. 272), Winston-Salem (No. 270), share the lowest rate at 2.3%. In Concord, homeowners pay a median $2,803 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,956 and household income of $123,030. In Charlotte, homeowners pay a median $2,976 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,029 and household income of $131,509. In Winston-Salem, homeowners pay a median $2,244 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $1,622 and household income of $98,894.\n\nPaterson, NJ, has the highest rate at 9.8%. Homeowners pay a median $9,779 per year, with a median monthly housing cost of $2,869 and household income of $100,227.\n\nMontgomery, AL, has the lowest property taxes both relatively and absolutely, with 1.1% of homeowner income going to cover a $917 annual median bill.\n\nWhile North Carolina’s largest cities rank relatively low in property tax burden, lawmakers are still exploring reforms and possible exemptions that could further ease costs.\n\nIn recent years, taxes have jumped for many who live in growing areas with increasing home values, such as the Triangle.\n\nEarlier this month, the state’s House Speaker Destin Hall named 23 House members to a new committee chaired by Republicans, who control the House.\n\nIt’s currently reviewing property tax relief programs to modify or expand them. It’s also considering the frequency of property revaluations for homeowners.\n\nState law requires property value reassessments every eight years, but some counties do them more frequently, including Wake County, which earlier this year moved to a cycle of every two years, The N&O previously reported.\n\n“We’ve seen across the state, especially here in Wake County, but in Caldwell, where I’m from, as well, we’ve seen real estate values go up sometimes 100%, just over four years or so. And it’s made the tax bills go through the roof,” Hall said.\n\nThe committee plans to finish its work, and submit any proposed legislation, before the 2026 session begins.",

    "description": "Today, in surprising rumors...",
    "fullText": "A very surprising name emerged today as a suggested way for Arizona to address their third-base situation. Would you believe, three-time All-Star, Alex Bregman? According to USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, “The Arizona Diamondbacks have become a surprise entrant in the Alex Bregman sweepstakes and are ‘kicking the tires’ on the possibility.” Nick Piecoro subsequently confirmed the interest: “A source indicated that the way such an agreement could come together would be if Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick, the club’s managing general partner, opted to increase the team’s spending power.”\n\nThat would seem to go against what ownership have publicly been saying this offseason. Both owner Ken Kendrick and team president Derrick Hall have said the team will look to rein in payroll, on the back of consecutive seasons with record salary, but coming up short of the playoffs. The team has already spent what was expected to be most of the available resources, on adding free-agent pitchers Michael Soroka and Merrill Kelly. Another alternative would be to trade away salary. The obvious name there is Ketel Marte, around whom rumors have already been swirling. He is due to earn $15 million next year. But that would only defray the expected price for Bregman. MLB Trade Rumors projects the free-agent to get a contract of six years, and $160 million, an AAV of almost $27 million.\n\nThe scenario might start off with trading Marte – maybe to the Red Sox, who are one of the main suitors for Bergman, since he has played for them last year – for pitching. Move Jordan Lawlar to play second-base, and sign Bregman as a long-term solution at the hot corner. However, one of the things which weighs against this, is simply the fact we are hearing about it. GM Mike Hazen has habitually kept a very tight ship in regard to his moves. Did we hear anything about the signing of Corbin Burnes, for example? In fact, I’m hard pushed to think of a major move in his era, which was solidly rumored in advance of becoming a fact [and I’m not counting the re-signing of Merrill Kelly]. The finances are also a problem. So, for now, I’m still skeptical. But, hey, it certainly makes for more interesting times than waiting for Hazen to do something!",

    "fullText": "Fernando Mendoza returns home with the Heisman and unfinished business originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFernando Mendoza brought the Heisman Trophy back to Bloomington but made it clear the season’s most important work still lies ahead.\n\nFernando Mendoza arrived at the podium with the Heisman Trophy at his side. Its presence was heavy and unmistakable, a reflection of where Indiana football now stands.\n\nIndiana is 13–0. A Big Ten champion. Home to a Heisman winner. And yet nothing about Mendoza’s message sounded like a victory lap. This was not a moment to linger in. It was one to acknowledge, honor, and then move past.\n\n“This page is folded,” Mendoza said. “Our focus right now is winning the College Football Playoff.”\n\nThat balance defined the afternoon. Mendoza spoke about responsibility and humility, about the fraternity of Heisman winners and how the weight of the trophy only grows with time. He also spoke with emotion about family, heritage, and why it mattered to him to address his grandparents in Spanish on college football’s biggest stage.\n\n“All four of my grandparents were born and raised in Cuba,” Mendoza said. “They emigrated to the United States and sacrificed so much to support my parents and then my parents to support myself.”\n\nFor Mendoza, the moment extended beyond his own family. He referenced fellow Heisman finalist Diego Pavia, the Vanderbilt quarterback, and the sight of an entire family showing up together, something that resonated deeply.\n\n“You see like Diego Pavia’s family, he had like 100 people there too,” Mendoza said. “That’s just how the Hispanic culture is. The Hispanic family is so prideful and supportive of one another.”\n\nMORE: Jeff Monken struggles to put words to Army’s heartbreaking loss to Navy\n\nThat connection made the moment bigger than an individual award.\n\n“I thought saying something in Spanish would mean a lot to them,” Mendoza said. “And also for the Hispanic community out there, because I know there’s a lot of Hispanic football fans.”\n\nHe acknowledged the responsibility that comes with visibility, especially for young players who may not see themselves reflected in college football’s most celebrated moments.\n\n“It’s something that I’m looking forward to represent,” Mendoza said.\n\nFernando described himself as a different player than the one who arrived in spring, a transformation he said even his teammates did not foresee. Once a two star recruit committed to Yale, he now stands as the face of the most accomplished season in Indiana football history. He did not frame it as destiny. He framed it as preparation, accountability, and trust in the people around him.\n\nMORE: College Football Playoff expansion proposals that could have changed everything for Notre Dame and BYU\n\nThe Heisman Trophy mattered. The symbolism mattered. Indiana football changed in that room. But Mendoza made one thing clear. The season’s meaning will not be defined by what sits on a podium.\n\nIndiana will face the winner of Alabama and Oklahoma on New Year’s Day at the Rose Bowl with a path to the national championship now fully in view.\n\nBrian Hartline sends a message to Chris Henry Jr. after choosing Ohio State\n\nDeion Sanders expected to lose key staff member to Group of Five school\n\nTavita Pritchard comes home to Stanford with a message of ‘belief and brotherhood’",

    "fullText": "UNC improved to 10-1 on the season with a 77-58 win over East Tennessee State in the Dean Dome on Tuesday night. The Tar Heels and Buccaneers played a fairly evenly matched first half that saw Carolina go to the locker room with just an eight-point lead before turning on the jets and putting plenty of distance between them and ETSU in the second half.\n\nCarolina was led by a career night from Henri Veesar. The Heels’ started three guys taller than the tallest ETSU player and Veesaar definitely took advantage of it down low. He finished with 26 points and eight rebounds before the starters were pulled after the game was well in hand. Veesaar’s 26 points beat his previous career-high of 24 points that he scored against St. Bonaventure. Caleb Wilson also put on a show, scoring 20 points and pulling down eight boards. No other Tar Heels finished in double figures. Derek Dixon finished with seven points in 14 minutes of action. Kyan Evans scored six points to go with his six assists and no turnovers. Jarin Stevenson had six points and four assists as well.\n\nThe second half was so lopsided that at one point Carolina had out-scored the Buccaneers 22-9. Hubert Davis decided to give the bench some extended minutes, which gave ETSU an opportunity to to make the score more respectable. Still, the Heels shot 46% from the field in the second half. Free throw shooting continues to leave something to be desired, if you’re looking for nits to pick, but it wasn’t a factor in this one.\n\nAfter last year’s deficiencies with size down low, it is so nice to see a Carolina team be able to bully a smaller opponent with guys like Veesaar and Wilson. They present a big challenge for other teams, especially when they are both firing on all cylinders the way they were tonight.\n\nTwo non-conference games remain for the Tar Heels before they start ACC play against Florida State on New Year’s Eve Eve. Next up is Ohio State in the CBS Sports Classic on Saturday which may feature the return of Seth Trimble.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt is beginning to settle in that Nebraska Cornhuskers quarterback Dylan Raiola won't remain in Lincoln next fall.\n\nFor former Cornhuskers linebacker-turned-podcast host Will Compton, he is open to a fresh start for his alma.\n\n\"It is what it is,” Compton said on \"Bussin' With the Boys.\" “Personally, it’s like, I know he had the injury with the broken leg and everything else. What he’s done, what Dylan has meant to Nebraska for the last couple years – he’s a hell of a player, hell of a talent, hell of an athlete.\"\n\nCompton said Raiola leaving was inevitable. It was just a matter of when.\n\n“Now that he’s [going] in the portal, everything that I’ve heard behind the scenes and everything else, I kind of knew that this was coming,\" Compton said. \"At this point, it’s more like, it is what it is. This is the world we live in now. And he’s not the guy that’s going to be the quarterback under center for Nebraska next year. So whoever that next guy’s going to be – whether it’s in-house right now or somebody we get out of the portal – I’m going to be the biggest fan.”\n\nCompton suggested that NIL potentially played a factor, but didn't go into specifics as to why he knew that this was happening.\n\n\" How I went through Nebraska, how you think of [it] has a competitor and everything else you see with this NIL world, I was hopeful that he would be in this process of getting healthy and everything else, and want to continue to build on the little success that we’ve had over the last couple years and continue to be the guy and continue to run into the fight and bring this program back to what we want it to be,\" Compton said.\n\nAs for what's next, Compton said he is unsure who the new quarterback could be, but says Nebraska will eventually be better off once it figures it out.\n\n“That’s not surprising,” Compton said. \"\n\n“I knew that that was coming. … I’ve spoke with people over the weekend. Those conversations will stay with me and who I was talking to,\" Compton said. “But all the evidence has let up to, he’s going to be hitting the portal at some point. … Listen, we’re going to find us a quarterback. Not even worried about this.”\n\nFor now, Nebraska is a little under two weeks away from playing in a bowl game which could easily springboard how next year may transpire\n\nWhat happens next, though, could potentially define coach Matt Rhule's tenure, who admitted he is dissatisfied with where the program is and knows he can do better.\n\n“This season is not good enough for the standard that we want to set at Nebraska,” Rhule said. “Back-to-back bowl bowl seasons for the first time in a long time, all that’s great. But we have higher expectations for what we want to get done. We ended the season on a real down note, losing the last two games and by a score that wasn’t representative of the team that went out and played Michigan and USC and earlier in the year.”",

    "description": "Our Louisiana vs. Delaware predictions expect the Blue Hens to ride their passing game to victory in the 68 Ventures Bowl.",
    "fullText": "Bowl season rolls right along as we get into the thick of the matchups when the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens take on the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns.\n\nIt’s one of the few bowl games that at least appears to be void of many significant opt-outs for either side.\n\nI break down the matchup in my Louisiana vs. Delaware predictions and college football picks for the 68 Ventures Bowl below.\n\nI think the Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens win. They have the more reliable passing efficiency, and Louisiana’s tendency to allow opponents to stay on schedule through the air is a problem. It should allow them to make enough plays to come up with the W.\n\nFrom a bowl game perspective, this is one of the easier handicaps you’ll have. Both teams have some injuries, but there are virtually no opt-outs, along with normal prep and rest to get ready for this matchup. I’m riding with Delaware to cover at +2.5 as my best bet. I think this is basically a coin flip.\n\nQuarterback Nick Minicucci has been the driving force for Delaware. This is a very efficient passing game, and he’s completed over 60% of his passes for more than 1,400 yards. He’ll attack a Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns secondary that's been rather leaky, ranking 119th nationally in defensive success rate and 99th in pass success rate allowed.\n\nLouisiana has been the opposite. They’ve gotten modest production from the passing game all season and have leaned into a running committee led by Bill Davis to get the job done. That feels like it will be a problem against a solid Delaware defensive front that has kept the explosives on the ground at bay.\n\nI’d rather have the quarterback and passing game that can stay on schedule and has a clearer path to victory in this matchup.\n\nIt’s an all-Blue Hens SGP that holds true to the thought process of our best bet. The biggest advantage in this matchup for either team is the Delaware aerial attack against the Louisiana secondary, so why overthink it?\n\nWe're taking Nick Minicucci to have a big day through the air, hooking up regularly with one of his top targets in Sean Wilson.\n\nNick Minicucci Over 262.5 passing yards\n\nSean Wilson Over 56.5 receiving yards\n\nLouisiana is going to at least try to run the ball, which is going to bleed the clock. On the other side, I do think that the Delaware passing game will succeed, but it will likely involve a more methodical approach through intermediate passes.\n\nWe'll finish with Minicucci to throw 2+ passing touchdowns. Naturally, if he's having success through the air, there's a good chance he'll accomplish this. This position is strengthened by Delaware having issues at points this season running the ball in short-yardage situations.\n\nNick Minicucci Over 262.5 passing yards\n\nNick Minicucci Over 1.5 passing touchdowns\n\nSean Wilson Over 56.5 receiving yards\n\nSpread: Louisiana -2.5 | Delaware +2.5\n\nMoneyline: Louisiana -150 | Delaware +125\n\nOver/Under: Over 62.5 | Under 62.5\n\nLouisiana has cashed its team total Over in nine of its last 10 games for +7.85 units and a 67% ROI.

    "fullText": "The Old Dominion Monarchs (9-3) travel to Camping World Stadium for their StaffDNA Cure Bowl against the South Florida Bulls (9-3)\n\nWith both star quarterbacks opting out, my Old Dominion vs. South Florida predictions anticipate a low-scoring affair.\n\nRead on for my college football picks for Wednesday, December 17.\n\nI’m leaning toward Old Dominion to pull off the upset. The Monarchs are only missing their quarterback, but their coaching staff and defense remain intact.\n\nSouth Florida enters with far more disruption, including a new interim head coach and a reshuffled offense, making Old Dominion the more stable and reliable side.\n\nWednesday’s Cure Bowl matchup between the Old Dominion Monarchs and South Florida Bulls sets up as a lower-scoring, grind-it-out game.\n\nBoth teams enter with major question marks at quarterback, and inexperience at the position often leads to conservative play-calling, fewer explosive plays, and an emphasis on protecting the football.\n\nOld Dominion will turn to freshman Quinn Henicle, while South Florida starts journeyman Gaston Moore, an inexperienced combination that points toward the Under.\n\nDefensively, both units have proven capable of limiting points; Old Dominion allowed just 19.5 points per game during the regular season, while South Florida surrendered 23.\n\nThose are solid defensive numbers that reflect good red-zone defense and an ability to turn long, time-consuming drives into field goals.\n\nNeither defense was prone to getting gashed for quick scores during the regular season, and I don’t expect that to change with backup quarterbacks under center.\n\nThe continuity of Old Dominion’s stop unit, combined with a stout USF defense and likely ground-first approach from both offenses, should lead to a low-scoring Cure Bowl.\n\nNeither offense should score more than 24 points, especially with Old Dominion turning to Henicle after Colton Joseph opted out.\n\nSouth Florida has allowed fewer than 24 points in three of its last four games, reinforcing the case for the Under on Old Dominion’s team total.\n\nI also trust the largely intact Monarchs' defense to keep this contest within one score, allowing ODU to stay competitive and its offense to cover the number.\n\nOld Dominion team total Under 24.5\n\nSpread: Old Dominion +3.5 (-110) | South Florida -3.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Old Dominion +138 | South Florida -164\n\nOver/Under: Over 53.5 (-110) | Under 53.5 (-110)\n\nOld Dominion has hit the Game Total Under in their last five games (+5.00 Units / 91% ROI).

    "description": "Jackson LaCombe scored a goal off the back of the goalie's helmet with three minutes remaining to get Anaheim to overtime, but the Ducks couldn't secure the extra point and finished the five-game trip at 2-2-1.",
    "fullText": "COLUMBUS, Ohio – It was the back end of a back-to-back to close out a long Eastern road trip, and it certainly looked like it at plenty of points for the Anaheim Ducks.\n\nAnaheim did salvage a point to finish even on the road trip, but the Columbus Blue Jackets grabbed the extra point on a blazing overtime strike from Adam Fantilli in a 4-3 victory on Tuesday at Nationwide Arena.\n\nJackson LaCombe scored the equalizer off the back of Blue Jackets goalie Jet Greaves’ helmet with just over three minutes remaining. Anaheim and Columbus traded a combined four goals over a two-minute stretch in the second period, with Ryan Strome and Mikael Granlund. Zach Werenski scored twice for the Blue Jackets.\n\n“It’s never the easiest ones to play these back-to-back,” Granlund said on the Ducks Victory+ broadcast. “Obviously, we wanted the two points. It’s never easy, and at least we got the one point. Let’s move on from here.”\n\nVille Husso took the start in the second half of the back-to-back and stopped 24 of 28 shots.\n\nThe Ducks went 0-for-4 on the power play and killed off both Blue Jackets power plays in the third period.\n\nAnaheim finished up the five-game road trip at 2-2-1 with five of a possible 10 points. The Ducks return home for three games going into the Christmas break, starting on Friday against Dallas.\n\nThe Ducks (21-12-2, 42 points) edged into first place in the Pacific Division, but Vegas (16-6-9, 41 points) has three games in hand on Anaheim.\n\nAnaheim has equalized. Jackson LaCombe sends it in off the back of Jet Greaves' head from below the goal line, and the Ducks have erased the deficit.\n\n3-3 in Columbus. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/8JW7GRwe96\n\n— Zach Cavanagh (@ZachCav) December 17, 2025\n\nIt was an eventful road trip for Ducks defenseman Jackson LaCombe, who scored three goals and four points on the five-game road trip. LaCombe has points in six of the last seven games.\n\nTwo of LaCombe’s three goals on the road trip came from below the goal line.\n\nLaCombe scored the first goal of the trip with a sharp-angle shot coming down the left wing in Pittsburgh. On Tuesday, LaCombe tied the game off an even sharper angle coming down the left wing. The blue liner dropped below the goal line and shot off the back of the Columbus netminder’s helmet and in.\n\nLaCombe also popped in a shorthanded goal last night in New York City.\n\nThe 24-year-old paced the Ducks defensive corps in Columbus with 58.88% expected goal share at five-on-five.\n\nDucks even it up. Fourth line strikes with a give and go between Ryan Poehling and Ryan Strome, and Strome pots it.\n\n1-1. #FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/NTvi5eqOzQ\n\n— Zach Cavanagh (@ZachCav) December 17, 2025\n\nThe combination of Ross Johnston, Ryan Poehling and Ryan Strome led the Ducks’ offensive efforts at five-on-five.\n\nStrome scored off a give-and-go with Poehling for the Ducks’ first goal in the second period.\n\nIn 7:49 time-on-ice at five-on-five, the trio earned 88.36% of expected goals with a punishing forecheck. This was in sharp contrast to the second line of Chris Kreider, Mason McTavish and Beckett Sennecke, who combined for 9.34% expected goal share in 8:07 time-on-ice while struggling to clear the zone.\n\nOn a night where the Ducks looked gassed, energy shifts from the fourth line kept Anaheim within striking distance.\n\nDespite Cutter Gauthier sniping a power play goal off the rush in New York last night, Anaheim went 0-for-4 on the power play with just five shots with the extra man on Tuesday. The Ducks have gone 1-for-12 on the power play over the last five games and are 3-for-31 over the last 10 games.\n\nGauthier nearly put in another on the power play, as he beat the Columbus goalie five-hole in the final minute of the first period. However, the puck trickled through the netminder and off the far post to keep the power play off the board.\n\nAs he calls his 2,000th @AnaheimDucks regular-season game tonight, @DucksStream's Steve Carroll visits the TV booth to reminisce about playing drums, working in nightclubs, calling virtually every sport in existence and many other great memories throughout his distinguished… pic.twitter.com/DYlDn0PW1B\n\n— Victory+ (@victoryplustv) December 17, 2025\n\nIt was a momentous night on the broadcast side, as Ducks audio play-by-play Steve Carroll called his 2,000th regular-season game for Anaheim on Tuesday in Columbus. The Ducks have played 2,472 regular season games in franchise history, and Carroll has been the radio voice of the Ducks since 1999.\n\nMuch has changed in Carroll’s 27 seasons with Anaheim, going from terrestrial radio broadcasts over various airwaves to now online broadcasts via Ducks Stream on the TuneIn app.\n\nCarroll has been behind a microphone for nearly 50 years as a play-by-play broadcaster calling NHL hockey, minor league baseball, minor league hockey, pro soccer, college football and college basketball with broadcasts in every state except Alaska and Idaho.\n\nCarroll will be inducted into the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame next month.",

    "description": "Los Angeles made a pair of additions on Monday evening in hopes of shoring up its bullpen.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Angels added some bullpen depth with a pair of signings on Monday evening, reportedly agreeing to deals with right-hander Jordan Romano and left-hander Drew Pomeranz.\n\nRomano, a 32-year-old two-time All-Star, spent the 2025 campaign as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies. He struggled mightily, posting an 8.23 ERA in 49 total appearances.\n\nHe had appeared in just 15 games the season before for the Toronto Blue Jays, working to a 6.59 ERA and missing the majority of the year with an elbow injury. The right-hander had previously found promise in Toronto, earning back-to-back All-Star selections in 2022 and 2023 while recording 72 saves during that stretch.\n\nLos Angeles will look to help him return to the version of himself that tallied 95 saves from 2021-2023, holding an ERA below 2.20 in two of those seasons. His one-year deal with the Halos is worth $2 million.\n\nDrew Pomeranz heads to the Angels following an impressive return to baseball in 2025 with the Chicago Cubs, where he pitched 49 2/3 innings with a 2.17 ERA. The 37-year-old did not appear in the Major Leagues from 2022-2024, battling injury setbacks and working to return his body to health.\n\nNow, the 12-year veteran will look to build on his momentum from an inspiring comeback season, with Los Angeles looking for another reliable left-handed option. Pomeranz joins Brock Burke as the only other current southpaw option in the bullpen.\n\nThe Angels continue to load up on players who have shown past flashes of promise despite recent struggles or injury setbacks. This time around, it's a pair of players in Romano and Pomeranz that will look to add much-needed consistency to a bullpen that finished 2025 with the highest ERA in the American League.",

(Elio Della Ferrara/Stelvio National Park via AP)\n\nLombardy Region president Attilio Fontana attends a press conference in Milan, Italy, Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025, on a discovery of thousands of dinosaur tracks in Lombardy region. \n\nMILAN (AP) — A wildlife photographer stumbled upon one of the oldest and largest known collections of dinosaur footprints, dating back about 210 million years to the Triassic Period, high in an Italian national park near the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympic venue of Bormio, officials announced Tuesday.\n\nThe discovery in the Stelvio National Park was striking for the sheer number of footprints, estimated at as many as 20,000 over some five kilometers (three miles), and the location near the Swiss border, once a prehistoric coastal area, that has never previously yielded dinosaur tracks, experts said.\n\n“This time reality really surpasses fantasy,’’ said Cristiano Dal Sasso, a paleontologist at Milan’s Natural History Museum, who received the first call from wildlife photographer Elio Della Ferrera after making the discovery.\n\nThe dinosaur prints are believed to have been made by long-necked bipedal herbivores that were up to 10 meters (33 feet) long, weighing up to four tons, similar to a Plateosaurus, Dal Sasso said. Some of the tracks were 40 centimeters wide, with visible claws.\n\nThe footprints indicated that the dinosaurs traveled in packs and they sometimes stopped in circular formations, possibly as a protective measure.\n\n“There are very obvious traces of individuals that have walked at a slow, calm, quiet rhythmic pace, without running,’’ Dal Sasso told a press conference.\n\nThe tracks were discovered by Della Ferrera, who set out to photograph deer and vultures in September when his camera was trained on a vertical wall about 600 meters (nearly 2,000 feet) above the nearest road.\n\nThe location, some 2,400 to 2,800 meters (7,900-9,200 feet) above sea level on a north-facing wall that is mostly in the shade, made the footprints, though in plain sight, particularly hard to spot without a very strong lens, Dal Sasso said.\n\nDella Ferra said something strange caught his eye, and he scaled a vertical rock wall with some difficulty to get a closer look.\n\n“The huge surprise was not so much in discovering the footprints, but in discovering such a huge quantity,’’ Della Ferrara said. “There are really tens of thousands of prints up there, more or less well-preserved.’’\n\nThe entrance of the park, where the prints were discovered, is located just two kilometers (a mile) from the mountain town of Bormio, where Men’s Alpine skiing will be held during the Feb. 6-22 Games.\n\nLombardy regional governor, Attilio Fontana, hailed the discovery as a “gift for the Olympics,” even if the site is too remote to access in the winter, and plans for eventual public access have not been made.",

    "title": "The Best Open-Source Small Language Models",
    "description": "Small language models (SLMs) are compact LLMs designed to run efficiently in resource-constrained environments. They are now good enough for many production workloads.",
    "fullText": "When running open-source LLMs in production, you probably hit GPU limits faster than expected.\n\nVRAM fills up quickly. The KV cache grows with every request. Latency spikes as soon as concurrency increases. A model that works fine in a demo actually needs multiple high-end GPUs for production.\n\nFor many teams, proprietary models like GPT-5 feel like an easy way out. A simple API call hides the complexity of GPU memory management, batching, and scaling. However, that convenience comes with trade-offs: vendor lock-in, limited customization, unpredictable pricing at scale, and ongoing concerns about data privacy.\n\nThis tension brings teams back to self-hosting. The good news is that you no longer need large models to get strong results. Over the past year, advances in distillation, training data, and post-training have made small language models far more capable than their parameter counts suggest. Many now deliver solid reasoning, coding, and agentic performance, and fit comfortably on a single GPU.\n\nIn this post, we’ll look at the best open-source small language models, and explain when and why they make sense in certain cases. After that, we’ll answer some FAQs teams have when evaluating them for production deployments.\n\nSmall language models (SLMs) are best defined by their deployability, not just their parameter count. In practice, the term usually refers to models ranging from a few hundred million to around 10 billion parameters that can run reliably in resource-constrained environments.\n\nSome people might think SLMs are impractical for production. They are faster and cheaper to run, but noticeably weaker at reasoning, coding, and instruction following tasks. In fact, that gap has narrowed significantly with recent advances:\n\nToday, many popular open-source LLM families offer small parameter variants that are strong enough for production use. They power chatbots, agent pipelines, and high-throughput automation workflows where latency, cost, and operational simplicity matter more than sheer model size.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the top SLMs.\n\nGemma-3n-E2B-IT is an instruction-tuned multimodal small model from Google DeepMind, built for on-device and other low-resource deployments. It accepts text, image, audio, and video inputs and generates text outputs.\n\nWhile the raw parameter count is around 5B, it uses selective parameter activation, so it can run with a memory footprint closer to a traditional 2B model in many deployments.\n\nThe Gemma 3n family is trained on data spanning 140+ languages, which is a big deal if you need multilingual support without jumping to much larger models.\n\nWhy should you use Gemma-3n-E2B-IT:\n\nPhi-4-mini-instruct is a lightweight, instruction-tuned model from Microsoft’s Phi-4 family. It is trained on a mix of high-quality synthetic data and carefully filtered public datasets, with a strong emphasis on reasoning-dense content.\n\nWith only 3.8B parameters, Phi-4-mini-instruct shows reasoning and multilingual performance comparable to much larger models in the 7B–9B range, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. It’s a solid choice for teams that want strong instruction following and reasoning without the operational overhead of larger models.\n\nWhy should you use Phi-4-mini-instruct:\n\nLimited factual knowledge. Phi-4-mini-instruct doesn’t store large amounts of world knowledge. It may produce inaccurate or outdated facts, especially for knowledge-heavy or long-tail queries. I suggest you pair it with RAG or external tools for production use.\n\nLanguage performance varies. Although it supports multiple languages, performance outside English can be uneven. Non-English or low-resource languages should be carefully benchmarked before deployment.\n\nSensitive to prompt format. Phi-4-mini-instruct performs best with its recommended chat and function-calling formats. Otherwise, it can negatively impact instruction adherence and output quality. For example, you should use the following format for general conversation and instructions:\n\nQwen3-0.6B is the smallest dense model in Alibaba’s Qwen3 family, released under the Apache 2.0 license. Despite its tiny size, it inherits much of what makes Qwen3 notable: strong reasoning, improved agent and tool-use capabilities, and broad multilingual support.\n\nArchitecturally, Qwen3-0.6B is a 0.6B parameter causal LM with 32K context length. Like the rest of the Qwen3 line, it supports a hybrid behavior pattern that can switch between deeper reasoning and faster responses depending on your use case.\n\nStrong capability for a sub-1B model. If you want something meaningfully stronger than “toy” small models, but still lightweight enough for low-cost deployments, Qwen3-0.6B is a solid baseline. In some evaluations, it’s competitive even against much larger models like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.\n\nMultilingual out of the box. Qwen3 supports 100+ languages and dialects, and Qwen3-0.6B benefits from that training focus. It is an ideal choice for on-device global products that can’t afford larger multilingual models.\n\nAgent and tool-use friendly ecosystem. Qwen3 is designed with agent workflows in mind, and the tooling around it (templates, parsers, Qwen-Agent) reduces integration friction.\n\nIf you can afford a bit more compute, I also recommend Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B. They keep the same hybrid reasoning and agent-friendly design, but offer better performance for more complex tasks than the 0.6B model.\n\nSmolLM3-3B is a fully open instruct and reasoning model from Hugging Face. At the 3B scale, it outperforms Llama-3.2-3B and Qwen2.5-3B, while staying competitive with many 4B-class alternatives (including Qwen3 and Gemma 3) across 12 popular LLM benchmarks.\n\nWhat also sets SmolLM3 apart is the level of transparency. Hugging Face published the full engineering blueprint of it, including architecture decisions, data mixture, and post-training methodology. If you’re building internal variants or want to understand what actually drives quality at 3B, that matters.\n\nMinistral-3-3B-Instruct-2512 is a multimodal SLM developed by Mistral AI. It’s the smallest instruct model in the Ministral 3 family, designed specifically for edge and resource-constrained deployments.\n\nArchitecturally, it combines a 3.4B language model with a 0.4B vision encoder, supporting basic visual understanding alongside chat and instruction following. In practice, it can run on a single GPU and fit into roughly 8 GB of VRAM in FP8, or even less with further quantization.\n\nWhy should you use Ministral-3-3B-Instruct-2512:\n\nNow let’s take a look at some FAQs.\n\nThere’s no strict cutoff, but in practice, SLMs usually fall in the sub-1B to ~10B parameter range. Models in this range can often run on a single GPU without sharding or complex distributed inference setups.\n\nYes, for many use cases. Modern SLMs benefit from better training data, distillation, and post-training techniques, making them far more capable than earlier generations. In fact, you don’t need GPT-5.2-level capability for most real-world tasks.\n\nOne of their biggest advantages is fine-tuning. Small models are easier and cheaper to fine-tune on proprietary data such as internal documents, domain-specific workflows, or product knowledge. In narrow or specialized tasks, a well fine-tuned small model can outperform much larger general-purpose models, running faster and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nAs a result, SLMs are widely used in production for internal copilots, agent workflows and automation.\n\nOpen-source SLMs offer several advantages compared to LLMs, especially in production environments:\n\nFor many real-world applications, open-source SLMs provide a better balance of performance, cost, and operational simplicity.\n\nThe key differences come down to scale, cost, and operational complexity, which directly affect how and where each type of model makes sense in production.\n\nSLMs aren’t a compromise anymore. Used well, they’re often one of the fastest paths to reliable, scalable AI in production.\n\nWhy? Today, you’re not building AI products around a single model. You’re building AI systems.\n\nMany production setups combine multiple models with different strengths: SLMs for fast, cost-efficient inference, larger models for harder reasoning, and specialized vision or speech models where needed. In that kind of system, SLMs play a critical role. They’re easier to fine-tune, cheaper to run, and simple to scale, which makes them ideal building blocks for real-world AI workflows.\n\nTrying to build modern AI systems? This is where the Bento Inference Platform comes in. Bento lets you chain multiple models together, route traffic intelligently, and scale each component independently. You can mix SLMs and larger models freely, without locking your architecture to a single model or vendor.\n\nIf you’re thinking about running SLMs in production, we’d love to help.",

    "fullText": "Quarterly payments of $200 to be offered via stablecoin or traditional currency in a scheme designed to ease cost of living pressures in the Pacific nation\n\nThe Marshall Islands has introduced a national universal basic income (UBI) scheme that offers payments via cryptocurrency, alongside more traditional methods, which experts say is the first scheme of its kind in the world.\n\nUnder the program, every resident citizen of the Marshall Islands will receive quarterly payments of about US$200 as part of a government effort to ease cost of living pressures. The first instalments were paid in late November and recipients can choose whether the money is paid into a bank account, by cheque, or delivered as cryptocurrency on the blockchain through a government-backed digital wallet.\n\n“We the government want to make sure no one is left behind,” Marshall Islands’ minister for finance David Paul told the Guardian.\n\n“$200 per person per quarter, which is about $800 a year, does not compel you to quit your job … but it’s actually like a morale booster for people.”\n\nAn archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, the Marshall Islands lies between Hawaii and Australia, and has a population of about 42,000. Paul said the payments were intended as a “social safety net” as the country faces rising costs and citizens leaving.\n\nThe UBI scheme is financed by a trust fund created under an agreement with the United States, which in part aims to compensate the Marshall Islands for decades of American nuclear testing. The fund holds more than $1.3bn in assets, with the US committing a further $500m through to 2027.\n\nDr Huy Pham, associate professor and crypto-fintech lead at RMIT University, said the Marshall Islands scheme “is the world first for a national rollout of a UBI program.” He said the use of blockchain technology is “unique in terms of a nation-wide implementation.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency delivery option – which involves the transfer of a digital token known as a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar – was designed to address the practical challenge of delivering the money across hundreds of remote islands.\n\n“We saw the opportunity in what the blockchain has to offer,” Paul said.\n\nBlockchain is best known as the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but can also be used to store and transfer more traditional assets – like government bonds – which the Marshall Islands is using to underpin their digital payment scheme.\n\nBut according to Pham, digital payments alone do not necessarily provide financial inclusion, especially in a country like the Marshall Islands where internet connectivity is patchy and frequently disrupted.\n\n“Improving internet coverage, improving smartphone penetration – all these kinds of things are the minimum for a blockchain-based economy,” he said.\n\nMost recipients are choosing to receive payments through conventional channels. According to the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration, about 60% of the first round of payments were deposited directly into bank accounts, with the remainder issued as paper checks. Only a small number of people – about 12 so far, officials say – have signed up to receive payments on their digital wallet\n\nAnelie Sarana, the finance manager involved in the rollout, said over the past year her team has travelled to the outermost islands of the country to register people in the scheme.\n\nSarana said many recipients were using the money immediately for basic needs, like food and essentials, while others used the $200 to pay for celebrations to commemorate the annual Gospel Day holiday which coincided with the first distribution.\n\n“I know they’re happy, because you can see in the streets, there’s so much traffic, it’s like there’s a big something happening,” she said.\n\nThis is not the first time the Marshall Islands has experimented with using cryptocurrency. In 2018, the government attempted to create a national cryptocurrency known as the Sovereign, or SOV. The plan ultimately stalled after warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe IMF has cautioned that while the technology underpinning the latest scheme is innovative, the blockchain-based delivery of universal basic income carries “financial, fiscal, legal, reputational, and financial integrity risks”, particularly if governance and oversight are not robust.\n\nDr Monique Taylor, a lecturer in world politics at the University of Helsinki, said it was hard to predict if the Marshall Islands’ experiment with a universal basic income and a cryptocurrency delivery system would succeed.\n\n“Universal income schemes are rare, particularly at national scale, and there are no direct precedents that combine this fiscal architecture with a digital delivery component in a small island state,” she said.\n\nBut, she believed the scheme did present benefits for small island nations.\n\n“In a geographically dispersed island state where conventional banking infrastructure can be limited, a digital wallet may lower frictions and make transfers more accessible, particularly in outer atolls,” she said.",

    "description": "Customize Claude Code with skills, plugins, commands, and configuration files that transform a capable coding assistant into one that matches your exact workflow.",
    "fullText": "I’ve been using Claude Code for months now, and for most of that time, I was doing it wrong. Not wrong in the sense of getting bad results—the defaults are remarkably capable. Wrong in the sense that I was treating a customizable system like a fixed tool. I was adjusting my workflow to fit the AI instead of adjusting the AI to fit my workflow.\n\nThe difference between default Claude Code and a properly configured instance is the difference between hiring a talented generalist and hiring someone who’s worked at your company for years. Both can write code. Only one knows that your team prefers for…of over .forEach(), that you never use the I prefix on interfaces, and that when you say “analyze this bug,” you mean a specific six-step process that includes hypothesis testing.\n\nHere’s how I built that second version.\n\nClaude Code’s customization system has multiple layers, each serving a different purpose:\n\nWhat’s less widely appreciated is how these layers interact. When Claude Code starts a session, it reads your settings, loads relevant skills based on context, and injects CLAUDE.md into its system prompt. When you invoke a command, it triggers a predefined workflow. When you mention a topic covered by a skill, Claude applies that expertise automatically.\n\nMy ~/.claude/settings.json is minimal but deliberate:\n\nalwaysThinkingEnabled: true — This enables extended thinking on every response. The tradeoff is latency for quality. For complex refactoring or architectural decisions, I want Claude to think deeply. For quick questions, it’s overkill. I keep it on because my typical use case is substantial engineering work.\n\nToken limits — Increasing CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS to 64000 prevents truncation on large refactors. The MAX_THINKING_TOKENS setting controls how much “thinking” space Claude has before responding.\n\nincludeCoAuthoredBy: false — I don’t need AI authorship attribution in every commit message. Personal preference.\n\nThe full settings file is available in my dotfiles repo.\n\nEvery project gets a CLAUDE.md at the root. This is where you encode project-specific knowledge: commands to build and test, directory structure, coding principles, workflow patterns.\n\nThe key insight: CLAUDE.md is a system prompt you control. Every instruction you put here shapes every response you get. You can define escalation patterns that tell Claude to stop thrashing and switch to a structured process after failed attempts—for example, my Bug Fix workflow triggers a 6-step root cause analysis after two failed fixes.\n\nFull template: CLAUDE.md in dotfiles\n\nSkills are markdown files that encode specialized knowledge. When Claude detects that a skill is relevant to your task, it applies that expertise automatically.\n\nThis skill encodes my team’s TypeScript conventions—things that aren’t in style guides but matter for consistency:\n\nThe full skill covers interfaces vs types, enum conventions, null handling, type assertions, and module imports. It’s 700+ lines because TypeScript has a lot of conventions worth encoding.\n\nFor Lambda, DynamoDB, and SQS patterns:\n\nThis skill catches AI-generated code patterns that don’t match human-written code:\n\nThis is something I’ve noticed consistently: AI models add defensive code and comments that human developers wouldn’t. Having a skill that explicitly tells Claude to avoid these patterns makes the output feel more natural.\n\nSkills directory: skills in dotfiles\n\nSkills teach Claude how to code. Hooks enforce that it does. The difference matters.\n\nA skill might say “prefer for…of over .forEach()“—but Claude can still forget. A hook catches it in real-time, warning or blocking before the code is written. It’s the difference between training and guardrails.\n\nI use the hookify plugin to create enforcement rules from simple markdown files. Here are my active hooks:\n\nHooks are markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Here’s an example that blocks as any casts:\n\nThe action field determines severity:\n\nThis is where customization compounds. My TypeScript patterns skill teaches Claude the conventions. My hooks enforce them. If Claude violates a convention—say, using as Type instead of <Type>—the hook catches it before the code is written.\n\nThe feedback loop is immediate: Claude sees the warning, adjusts its output, and continues. Since Claude Code is stateless between sessions, the hooks provide consistent enforcement every time. Skills inform, hooks enforce.\n\nHooks directory: hooks in dotfiles\n\nCommands are like shell aliases for Claude workflows. Instead of typing a detailed prompt, you invoke /analyze-bug or /simplify and get a consistent, structured response.\n\nCommands directory: commands in dotfiles\n\nAgent docs are markdown files in .claude/agent_docs/ that Claude reads when relevant. Unlike skills (which encode how to do things), agent docs provide reference material (what things are).\n\nCLAUDE.md tells Claude when to read each doc. More efficient than stuffing everything into context—Claude loads docs on demand.\n\nAgent docs: agent_docs in dotfiles\n\nPlugins add new tools and workflows to Claude’s toolkit. I use several, organized by purpose:\n\nast-grep — Structural code search using AST patterns. Better than regex for finding code patterns that span multiple lines or have variable formatting. When I need to find all functions that return a Promise but don’t handle errors, ast-grep finds them regardless of formatting. Requires the CLI tool installed separately:\n\ndev-browser — Browser automation for testing web applications. When I say “go to localhost:3000 and click the login button,” Claude can actually do that.\n\nfrontend-design — UI/UX design assistance for frontend work. Part of the official Claude Code plugins.\n\nhookify — Creates enforcement rules from markdown files (covered in the Hooks section above). The key plugin for active convention enforcement.\n\ncommit-commands — Three git workflow commands:\n\nfeature-dev — A 7-phase structured workflow for complex features:\n\nFor complex features that touch multiple files, /feature-dev ensures nothing is missed.\n\npr-review-toolkit — Six specialized review agents that run in parallel:\n\nWhen I say “review my PR,” these agents analyze different dimensions simultaneously and return prioritized findings.\n\nPlugins are installed via the Claude Code plugin system. Official plugins require adding the Anthropic marketplace first:\n\nThe configuration in settings.json enables them:\n\nRun this to install my skills, commands, and hooks:\n\nThe script sets up ~/.claude/ and prints the plugin commands to run inside Claude Code.\n\nIf you prefer to set things up yourself:\n\nCreate ~/.claude/skills/typescript-patterns/SKILL.md with your TypeScript conventions. The filename must be SKILL.md and include frontmatter with name and description.\n\nCreate ~/.claude/commands/analyze-bug.md with your debugging workflow. Commands are invoked with /analyze-bug (the filename becomes the command name).\n\nAfter installing hookify, create enforcement rules:\n\nHooks take effect immediately—no restart required.\n\nCreate CLAUDE.md at the root of each project with project-specific instructions.\n\nMy complete configuration: github.com/stevenmays/dotfiles/tree/master/ai/claude\n\nHere’s what I didn’t expect: these customizations compound.\n\nA skill that teaches TypeScript conventions means Claude knows my preferences. A hook that enforces those conventions means Claude can’t forget them. A command that structures bug investigation means debugging follows a consistent process. A plugin that runs six review agents in parallel means PR reviews are thorough without being tedious.\n\nEach layer reinforces the others:\n\nThe time investment—maybe a few hours total—pays dividends on every subsequent session. I’m not constantly re-explaining preferences or correcting patterns. Claude already knows. And when it forgets, the hooks catch it.\n\nIt’s not that X is bad and Y is good, exactly; it’s more that default Claude Code is a capable generalist, while optimized Claude Code is a specialist who happens to share your opinions about code style, your workflow preferences, and your debugging methodology.\n\nThe choice is simple: accept defaults, work around quirks, and occasionally complain about AI-generated code that doesn’t match your style—or spend a few hours getting dialed in.",

    "description": "The judge ruled Tesla should have to suspend manufacturing and sales in California for 30 days, but the DMV stayed those rulings for 90 days to allow Tesla to comply.",
    "fullText": "An administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla engaged in deceptive marketing that gave customers a false impression of the capabilities of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver assistance software, a pivotal development in a years-long case initiated by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nThe judge agreed with the state DMV’s request to suspend Tesla sales for 30 days as a penalty for its actions, but the DMV stayed the order and is giving Tesla 60 days to modify or remove any deceptive language before implementing the suspension, according to multiple outlets. The judge also recommended suspending Tesla’s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\n“The DMV’s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California’s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,” DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “Tesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue — steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California’s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.”\n\nTesla said in a post on X that: “Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.”\n\n“This was a ‘consumer protection’ order about the use of the term ‘Autopilot’ in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there’s a problem,” the company wrote.\n\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it’s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to “take action regarding its use of the term ‘autopilot.’” The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla’s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\n\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\n\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state’s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\n\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla’s business as it remains the company’s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla’s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\n\nThe judge’s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver’s or passenger’s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla’s driving software than what the automaker’s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\n\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV’s press release and Tesla’s response.",

    "description": "Here’s the latest updates about the Enumclaw corridor.",
    "fullText": "A portion of Washington State Route 410 in Pierce County between Enumclaw and Greenwater will remain closed after flood damage resulted in part of the road falling into Boise Creek, the Washington State Department of Transportation confirmed Tuesday.\n\nThe closure is from Farman Street North at milepost 25 in Enumclaw to just west of Mud Mountain Dam Road at milepost 43 in Greenwater, said WSDOT communications manager RB McKeon in an email. The road first closed Dec. 11 following heavy rain. Given the widespread damage across multiple state highways and time needed to scope repairs, WSDOT could not provide a date when the road would fully reopen, she said.\n\nRivers in Pierce and King counties may continue to flood this week as another strong weather system is expected to arrive Tuesday night, as previously reported by The News Tribune.\n\nCrews have put up a temporary emergency lane on SR 410 to reduce weight on the damaged roadway, McKeon said. The lane will “allow limited, controlled access for emergency services and local traffic only, which is being convoyed via the Greenwater Fire Department at scheduled departures throughout the day,” she said.\n\nWSDOT has been working closely with partners in Greenwater, especially the Greenwater Fire Department, to help residents navigate the area while crews assess damage and restore immediate access while simultaneously planning for longer-term repairs, McKeon said.\n\nThe Enumclaw Police Department shared a photo on its Facebook page Monday showing parts of the eastbound lane at milepost 26.6 near Boise Creek collapsing into the water. McKeon said WSDOT is working to re-establish limited, single-lane access on the westbound lane with temporary traffic signals that will alternate eastbound and westbound traffic using one lane.\n\n“Crews moved quickly to construct the temporary lane, demonstrating the urgency of the response,” McKeon said. “However, returning the highway to its pre-storm condition will require additional time and a more comprehensive repair approach.”",

    "fullText": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Like many Australians strolling at Bondi Beach on long, warm summer evenings, Ahmed al Ahmed just wanted a cup of coffee with a friend. Around him, a bloody massacre erupted as two gunmen targeted Jews during Hanukkah festivities at a park close to the shore.\n\nSoon al Ahmed was creeping, bent over, between two parked cars, before barreling directly toward one of the unsuspecting shooters. In footage that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the 44-year-old father can be seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man’s shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker.\n\nThe story of the Syrian-Australian Muslim shop owner who put an end to the rampage of one of the shooters on Sunday has been seized upon by a country desperately seeking comfort after one of its darkest hours: the slaying of 15 people as they celebrated their Jewish faith.\n\nMillions have been raised for Bondi hero\n\n“At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,” Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday, as he left a Sydney hospital where al Ahmed is being treated for gunshot wounds. “We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.”\n\nA fundraising page established by Australians who had never met al Ahmed had attracted by Tuesday night donations by some 40,000 people, who gave 2.3 million Australian dollars ($1.5 million). Among the supporters was the billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, who pledged AU$99,000.\n\nFather of two faces a long recovery\n\nAl Ahmed, who is married with two young daughters, faces a long struggle ahead, those who have spoken to him since Sunday’s massacre say. He was shot multiple times in the left arm, apparently by the second gunman in the attack as the man fired indiscriminately from a footbridge.\n\nHe has already undergone surgery and more operations are scheduled, said Lubaba alhmidi Alkahil, a spokesperson for the Australians for Syria Association, who visited al Ahmed in a hospital late Monday. The “quiet and humble” man was conscious but frail and faced at least six months of recovery, Alkahil said.\n\nA prime minister and a president are fans\n\nIn the days since the attack, a pile of floral tributes and notes of thanks has grown outside the small tobacco store al Ahmed owns opposite a train station in suburban Sydney. Meanwhile, he has received visits at the hospital from Australia’s leaders, apparently telling Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state, that he’d take the same action again.\n\nHe has been hailed as a hero by world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Australia’s Governor General, who is the representative of Britain’s King Charles in the country. Minns said al Ahmed saved “countless” lives in what the premier said was “the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen.”\n\nAl Ahmed was once a police officer\n\nAl Ahmed lived in the town of Nayrab in Syria’s Idlib region before he arrived in Australia, his cousin Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. He left Syria in 2006 after finishing his studies, before the 2011 mass protests against the government of then-President Bashar Assad that were met with a brutal crackdown and spiraled into a nearly 14-year civil war.\n\nNayrab was heavily bombed by Assad's forces with most of the town’s houses flattened and reduced to rubble. On Tuesday, al Ahmed was the talk of the town.\n\n“Ahmed did really a heroic job,” his cousin, Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. “Without any hesitation, he tackled the terrorist and disarmed him just to save innocent people.”\n\nAhmed al Ahmed's parents, who came to Sydney this year to reunite with their son, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that their son had served with the police and in the central security forces in Syria. Father Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said his son’s “conscience and soul” compelled him to act on Sunday.\n\n“I feel pride and honor because my son is a hero of Australia,” the father said.\n\nTale of heroism gives hope amid tragedy\n\nIn the aftermath of the mass killing, a country roiling from one of the worst hate-fueled attacks ever on its soil — allegedly committed by an Australian resident who arrived from India in 1998 and his Australian-born son — looked for hope amid their grief. Stories of heroism have started to emerge.\n\nThey included the tale of a married couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, who were both killed while trying to stop one of the shooters as he climbed from his car and began the massacre, their family has told Australian news outlets.\n\nReuven Morrison, 62, was also killed while trying to stop the horror, according to his daughter, Sheina Gutnick. After al Ahmed wrestled the gun from one shooter, a person Gutnick identified as Morrison is seen throwing objects at the gunman — before he was shot by the second man.\n\nActs of courage like these were cited by many on social media and in news outlets as examples of what being Australian should mean.\n\n“When he did what he did, he wasn’t thinking at all about the background of the people he’s saving, the people dying in the street,” Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said of his son. “He doesn’t discriminate between one nationality and another, especially here in Australia there’s no difference between one citizen and another.”",

    "fullText": "Long, long ago a cloud of stars circled a galaxy-size black hole, safely at a distance. Then about 200 million years ago one member of the cloud bumped another, a sun-size star, and sent it toward the black hole. The black hole was a million times more massive than the sun-size star, and its gravitational pull proportionately stronger, so the star was drawn closer and closer—until it got too close. Some of the star’s gas was pulled into an orbiting stream around the black hole that widened into a flat pancake called an accretion disk. The rest of the star came apart in a sudden and great flash of light.\n\nOn September 19, 2019, just before noon, the flash reached the 1.2-meter mirror of the Zwicky Transient Facility in southern California. Astronomers named the flash AT2019qiz and noted that they hadn’t seen it three days before. On September 25, 2019, the 10-meter Keck I telescope in Hawaii identified AT2019qiz as a so-called tidal disruption event—a flare-up that occurs when a black hole’s gravitational tides rip a small object apart. The star the size of the sun exploded with 10 billion times the sun’s luminosity.\n\nBut AT2019qiz wasn’t finished yet. An entirely unrelated star, maybe from the same cloud, was on an orbit that intersected AT2019qiz’s newly created disk. Each time this other star splashed into the disk, it flashed, though less brilliantly than the original, pulled-apart star. In December 2023 the brightness of AT2019qiz (now the name of the disrupted star, the accretion disk and the flaring star that ran into them) peaked, dimmed down and then shot up again—a pattern that repeated nine times. Each flash marked a pass of the interloper through the disk, which occurred every 48 hours. Between 2019 and 2024, astronomers observed AT2019qiz with telescopes on the ground and in space, at wavelengths from x-ray through ultraviolet, optical and infrared. The multitelescope, multiwavelength data together confirmed that AT2019qiz was first a tidal disruption event and then a “quasi-periodic eruption.” Both are examples of phenomena astronomers call transients. Both involved unspeakable violence on unearthly scales. Neither could have been identified 20 years ago.\n\n[\nTransients, which are astronomical objects that appear suddenly from nowhere and usually disappear soon after, contradict the standard truth that the universe changes predictably and slowly over billions of years. They include what the typically staid National Academy of Sciences called “the most catastrophic events in spacetime.” They are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days—which is a combination of size and speed that seems impossible. If we didn’t observe them, says astronomer Vikram Ravi of the California Institute of Technology, “you’d never know that physics allows these things to exist.”\n\nBut physics says everything not forbidden will, sooner or later and with some probability, happen. And astronomers, noticing these improbable things and knowing that nothing is one of a kind, began to find many more, all at the far reaches of physics. Between 1976 and 2012, the number of transients listed on the International Astronomical Union’s official Transient Name Server was around five each year. Between around 2013 to 2015, that number jumped to about 100. Since 2019, scientists have seen roughly 20,000 a year. At press time, the total was 175,953 transients. Chart this rise, and it looks like a long tail with an elephant attached.\n\nThe growth has been the result of a large number of astronomical surveys, most still ongoing, “vacuuming the whole sky,” says experimental physicist Christopher Stubbs of Harvard University. For instance, the Zwicky Transit Facility, which started the jump in detections in 2019, scans the entire northern sky every two nights and compares each evening’s images with the ones taken two nights before. And the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile, which came online in 2025, will soon survey the entire southern sky every three nights, identifying changes within 60 seconds of their detection to create near-real-time movies of the sky and finding 10 million changes every day. The elephant will go seriously nonlinear.\n\nWith such a large amount of data, astronomers can begin to study credible demographics: that is, they can move from just finding these wild, unlikely creatures to figuring out what they are. Because things that happen once and disappear are hard to study, the transients’ identities—the physics that drives them, the processes that produce them—are still speculative. Most of their names are just adjectives, and “when the transient’s name is a description,” says astrophysicist Raffaella Margutti of the University of California, Berkeley, “that tells you we know nothing intrinsic about them.” That’s about to change.\n\nScientists sort transients into two main groups: events involving the deaths of stars and events around supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies. The first known transients fell into the former category: they were supernovae, or massive stars that blow up. Before the 1600s, astronomers confidently knew of five of them; now they count tens of thousands. Supernovae fit into two general categories. One kind is the dead core of a star pulling gas from a nearby star, piling up mass until nuclear fusion restarts and goes critical and the whole thing pops off like a 20-billion-billion-billion-megaton thermonuclear bomb, which it is. It explodes in a day, stays bright for days to weeks, and fades out over months.\n\nThe other type of supernova is called a core collapse: A star burns through enough of its fuel and is massive enough that the outward push of its radiation loses to the inward pull of its gravity. Its core collapses in on itself so thoroughly that its electrons meld with the nuclei of its atoms until the star is made mostly of neutrons—a neutron star—and it shrinks in the space of one second from a radius of about 6,000 kilometers to about 10 kilometers. The collapse causes a shock wave that breaks out of the star’s remaining atmosphere with a flash called a shock breakout, and minutes later the star is as bright as 10 billion suns. It fades out over months; the remnant is called a neutron star.\n\nBeyond these two main categories, though, are many variants—the Transient Name Server identifies 31 types so far. One new kind, called a gap transient, is dimmer and probably less massive than other supernovae, and nobody knows why it explodes. Another is a superluminous supernova, twice as luminous as a core collapse supernova; it has the light of 20 billion suns, and nobody knows why it’s so bright. Supernovae are by far the most numerous of the stellar-death transients, but, as astronomer James E. Gunn of Princeton University points out, stars have “a vast number of interesting ways to die.”\n\nIn 1967, for instance, the U.S. Vela satellites detected surprising flashes of extremely energetic gamma rays that could have been (but weren’t) illegal nuclear tests in Earth’s atmosphere; the National Enquirer thought similar flashes seen later might be a space war between alien civilizations. Eventually astronomers pooled data from the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to identify the flashes, which were the first known gamma-ray bursts—a class of transients now understood to be “the brightest of the brightest,” says astrophysicist Peter Jonker of Radboud University in the Netherlands, who observes space in high-energy wavelengths. Their light rises in seconds to the brightness of a trillion suns, and they last for seconds to hours. The fastest ones might be massive stars going supernova, collapsing so thoroughly that they don’t stop at neutron stars and instead condense into star-size black holes that aim high-intensity jets of plasma at Earth.\n\nGamma-ray bursts may or may not be related to other high-energy stellar deaths called fast x-ray transients. Discovered in 2008, they number only around 70, although this tally will soon change. China’s Einstein Probe, an x-ray satellite telescope that began collecting data in mid-2025, should find 50 to 100 fast x-ray bursts a year. “The next few years could be dramatic,” says astronomer Mansi Kasliwal of Caltech. Meanwhile, because fast x-ray transients are still rare, no one is ready to say what they are—maybe massive stars exploding, maybe neutron stars colliding before disappearing into black holes.\n\nAnother dramatic rarity is called a fast optical blue transient, or FBOT—“fast” because although it explodes at the same outrageous brightness as a superluminous supernova, its light rises and falls not in months but in days. The first FBOT, found in 2018, is officially named AT2018cow and is called Cow for short. Since then, scientists have seen 12 more Cow-like FBOTs. Astronomers know they’re not supernovae—“the energy source of the normal supernovae doesn’t work” for Cows, Margutti says—but aren’t sure what they are. Maybe they flash when a nearby star’s mass piles up onto a neutron star or a modest-size black hole, or maybe they represent shock breakouts from a star that puffed up in its later years. “Whatever they are,” says astronomer Anna Y. Q. Ho of Cornell University, who helped to find the original Cow, “they’re interesting.”\n\nIn 2007 radio astronomer Duncan Lorimer and astrophysicist Maura McLaughlin, who are colleagues at West Virginia University and married, were looking in the archives of a radio telescope survey at a small galaxy 200,000 light-years away. They were interested in pulsars, which are rotating neutron stars that release jets of radio light from their magnetic poles. These lighthouselike jets sweep the sky so that whatever is in their path is exposed to a metronomically regular radio pulse every few seconds to milliseconds.\n\nIn the course of their search, Lorimer and McLaughlin found a radio spike that lasted a few milliseconds, but it didn’t pulse and was so bright it saturated the telescope’s instrument. Lorimer calculated its distance as seven billion light-years away. “Oh,” he thought, “it’s really far.” Anything that distant and still that bright had to be sending out a billion times more energy than nearby pulsars.\n\nThis odd find is now called the Lorimer Burst. Surveys have since identified several thousand of these so-called fast radio bursts scattered throughout other galaxies, emitting in one millisecond the radio energy sent out by the sun in 100 years. “These things are weird,” Lorimer says.\n\nSome of these possible stellar death transients could be related to a deeply strange object called a magnetar. Magnetars existed only in theory until they were observed in 1998. Their weirdness quotient is high even among transients. A magnetar is a neutron star that “rotates ridiculously fast,” making a full turn in milliseconds, says Daniel Kasen of the University of California, Berkeley, “but with a ridiculously high magnetic field.” The strength of the sun’s magnetic field is somewhere around 10 gauss; a magnetar’s is 1014 gauss or higher. That field is “so high it’s unstable,” Ravi says. “It chaotically reconfigures itself.”\n\nTransients are astronomically sized objects that change on human timescales—in seconds, hours, days.\n\nThe object’s magnetic field lines twist and snap and reconnect, and in the process they send out flares. The combination of absurdly strong magnetic fields and absurdly fast rotation leads to lots of explosive physics, Kasen says. In 2004 a flare from one magnetar halfway across the Milky Way ionized the upper layers of Earth’s atmosphere. Astronomers know of around 30 of them in our galaxy so far.\n\n“Magnetars are invoked to explain a lot of things we don’t understand,” says Brian Metzger of Columbia University, a theoretical astrophysicist who specializes in stellar-death transients. For instance, different transients might be different phases of a magnetar’s life. Magnetars might be born in the core collapse of the same massive stars as superluminous supernovae. A supernova might then condense into a pulsar and send out jets that are seen as gamma-ray bursts. Later, when the magnetar’s spin period has slowed from milliseconds to seconds, its flares may be seen as a fast radio burst. Magnetars might even explain FBOTs, Ho says, but so far FBOTS are too distant for scientists to be sure.\n\nThe stellar-death transients are dying in ways intrinsic to stars. But stars can also die because they’re just in the cosmically wrong place, in the nuclei of galaxies with supermassive black holes. These “nuclear transients,” the second overall category of transients, have turned up only in the past decade. They’re rare and barely understood.\n\nOne reason for that is that nuclear transients “are a minefield of contamination,” says Suvi Gezari of the University of Maryland, College Park. Astronomers must distinguish the flashes of nuclear transients from supermassive black holes whose behavior varies. One percent of supermassive black holes, the quasars, are furiously, actively accreting gas and shine so brightly they can be seen near the beginning of the universe. Most of the rest are inactive and just flickering; they have gravitationally cleared out much of the space around them, and their brightness varies by just 10 to 45 percent. And another, unknown fraction are not accreting at all; they’re completely black and invisible.\n\nNuclear transients are not active quasars, and they don’t flicker—they’re cosmic flash-bangs. One kind is a tidal disruption event such as AT2019qiz, a star trapped in a supermassive black hole’s gravitational field and torn to smithereens. Astronomers have found around 100 tidal disruption events, each visible for a few months in the x-ray, optical and ultraviolet ranges, each with its own small accretion disk that lasts for a few tens of years. Maybe one in 10 tidal disruption events do what AT2019qiz did and become the site of another kind of nuclear transient, the quasi-periodic eruption. In these cases, an errant star passes through the tidally disrupted star’s accretion disk and flares up in x-rays to the brightness of a billion suns. Such flares last minutes and repeat in hours to weeks.\n\nOther nuclear transients may not involve stars at all and may reflect odd behavior of the black holes. One kind of transient discovered in the past decade is called a changing-look quasar (CLQ). It has the brightness of a normal quasar but rapidly changes its appearance in unexplainable ways. It should take thousands of years for a quasar to switch off and go from brilliantly active to quietly inactive. Yet astronomers have found dozens to hundreds of CLQs that change their looks by 200 percent in months—they change so much and so quickly that “they’re not theoretically explainable,” says astrophysicist Paul Green of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Maybe they’re the aftermath of a long-gone tidal disruption event, or maybe, he says, “we haven’t watched long enough to see a change of state that’s lasting.”\n\nAs if CLQs weren’t improbable enough, astronomers also find ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), whose problem is in their name: “They’re ambiguous,” says astrophysicist Philip Wiseman, who studies nuclear transients at the University of Southampton in England. They are a diagnosis of exclusion, a flash that isn’t any other transient. ANTs are brighter than all transients except gamma-ray bursts. Their light rises slowly over months and lasts for two or more years. They’ve been found in data archives in numbers from a few to hundreds, depending on who’s defining them. “We can find them, but we don’t know what they are,” says astronomer Matthew Graham of Caltech, another nuclear-transients specialist.\n\nThese events are flashes of inconceivable amounts of energy.\n\nOne ANT discovered in 2020 became famous: At first astronomers thought it was an actively feeding supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy, but they couldn’t find the galaxy. The lonely supermassive black hole, like a kind of negative island, is somewhere between 10 and 1,000 times the size of the one in the Milky Way. One of its names is ZTF20abrbeie; astronomers call it Scary Barbie.\n\nANTs could be outsize tidal disruption events—that is, instead of sun-size stars being torn apart by black holes with the mass of a million suns, they might be 10-solar-mass stars torn apart by black holes with the mass of a billion suns. Or they could be supermassive black holes moving from inactive flickering to active fiery accretion—black holes “turning on,” Graham says. Researchers are still looking for Scary Barbie’s galaxy. “We’re guessing at half this stuff,” Graham adds.\n\nThe obvious question is, Are some of these transients somehow aspects of the same thing? For stellar-death transients, the answer is not exactly no. Several of them may be related to one another or to magnetars; in general, they’re a menu of the variables that determine how stars end their lives. For nuclear transients, the answer is unsatisfying: either a captured star or a black hole’s accretion disk is brightening. For a better answer, astronomers need to collect many more nuclear transients.\n\nNor can stellar and nuclear transients be put together into a single grand unified theory. Such a picture should be based on their physics—specifically, the source of energy for their outbursts. “The holy grail is understanding what produced the transient,” says Eliot Quataert of Princeton, a theoretical astrophysicist studying nuclear transients. Theorists want to be able to slot energy sources into a few categories, such as radioactive decay, shocks and gravity, although some transients don’t seem to fit into any of these boxes.\n\nTo figure out the energy sources and maybe unify transients, astronomers need to compare what they see in different wavelengths, which each reflect different physical processes. In supernovae, for instance, ultraviolet light comes from shock breakouts, and x-rays and radio waves come from collisions between matter ejected in the explosion and the surrounding gas. Collecting every possible photon from every physical process allows astronomers to assemble a complete picture of the event.\n\nAccordingly, telescopes now operating in optical, ultraviolet, x-ray, gamma-ray and radio-wave bands are about to be joined by a series of new telescopes in space. Among them are NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, which will launch by mid-2027 and observe in the infrared; the Einstein Probe in x-ray; and NASA’s Ultraviolet Explorer, which will launch in 2030.\n\nYou might wonder whether this is a lot of telescopes and effort just to learn about 100,000 one-offs in a universe full of 10,000 billion billion stars in 100 billion galaxies. Understanding transients is important partly for answering other astronomical questions. Supernovae are used as distance markers to enable calculations of the universe’s acceleration. Both tidal disruption events and quasi-periodic eruptions hold evidence about supermassive black holes that are quiescent and therefore invisible, as well as about the all but theoretical class of black holes whose masses are between those of stellar black holes and supermassive ones. And fast radio bursts, because they are visible in the distant universe, can be used as searchlights to map the distribution of regular matter, of which only 10 percent is known.\n\nBut transients are also interesting for their own odd selves, for their ability to teach us what physics doesn’t forbid. Kasen says they are “laboratories for fundamental physics and extreme conditions”; they are “physics at the extreme,” Margutti says, “and I can’t probe that on Earth.” Transients show “the range of phenomena possible in the universe,” Ravi says.\n\nThese events are flashes of inconceivable amounts of energy released in the time it takes to buy groceries, drink a glass of water or snap your fingers. A supernova shock breakout travels the distance from Baltimore to Western Australia in half an eyeblink. A magnetar passing 160,000 kilometers away could demagnetize every credit card on Earth. A neutron star compresses a massive star to the length of a leisurely two-hour walk. The study of transients is certifiable science, but if it weren’t, it would still be reason for near-holy astonishment.",

The incident, characterized by authorities as \"extreme\" road rage, occurred on November 19, 2022, near the Walton Roundabout in Milton Keynes.\n\nMistry, driving a silver BMW, engaged in a dangerous altercation with a motorcyclist, a man in his 40s, following what police described as a \"non-verbal exchange.\" The situation quickly escalated as Mistry attempted to force the motorcyclist off the road by swerving towards him. In a bid to avoid a collision, both parties ended up on the wrong side of the road.\n\nWARNING! This video is graphic and can be disturbing to some viewers!\n\nThe confrontation reached a critical point when Mistry trapped the motorcyclist between his vehicle and a metal barrier, causing a collision with an oncoming car. The impact sent the motorcyclist flying off the bridge and into the undergrowth below, resulting in serious injuries. He was subsequently airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for urgent medical attention. Additionally, the front seat passenger of the car involved in the collision also sustained serious injuries and required hospitalization.\n\nCaptured on shocking video footage, the collision and the subsequent airborne trajectory of the motorcyclist highlighted the severe consequences of Mistry's actions. In December of the same year, Mistry pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Aylesbury Crown Court handed down a sentence of four years and 10 months in prison. Furthermore, Mistry received a driving disqualification for the same duration and will be required to pass an extended re-test before he can regain his driving license.\n\nPC Phil McGlue of the Roads Policing Unit, the investigating officer, stated, \"This case is an extreme example of road rage.\" He emphasized that Mistry's decision to respond with disproportionate violence turned a road disagreement into a grave assault. \"Drivers who behave in such a manner will be rigorously investigated and held to account for their actions,\" McGlue added, underlining the consequences of such reckless behavior on public roads.",

    "title": "Aftermath Of Ukraine’s Underwater Drone Attack On Russian Submarine Seen In Satellite Imagery",
    "description": "Ukraine's submersible drone navigated into a protected harbor and detonated very close to the targeted submarine.",
    "fullText": "Satellite imagery is now available showing the aftermath of a Ukrainian attack yesterday on a Russian Navy Improved Kilo class diesel-electric submarine in the Black Sea naval stronghold of Novorossiysk. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed that this was the first attack against a Russian vessel using an uncrewed underwater vehicle (UUV). The operation could also mark the historic first successful use of a UUV as an anti-ship weapon, but the actual level of damage inflicted on the submarine remains unclear. Readers can first get up to date on the attack in our initial reporting here.\n\nTWZ obtained satellite images of where the attack occurred in Novorossiysk from Vantor (formerly Maxar Technologies). Additional imagery from Planet Labs has also been circulating online.\n\nThe satellite imagery confirms that the UUV — named by the SBU as a Sub Sea Baby, a previously unknown type — detonated off the stern of the submarine, which was at a pier in the port of Novorossiysk. A substantial chunk of the pier itself was destroyed in the attack. This all aligns with video footage shot during the attack from a position on the ground nearby, which the SBU released yesterday.\n\nСБУ вразила підводний човен рф у Новоросійську\n\nДеталі за посиланням\n\nhttps://t.co/2PjfguPVnMpic.twitter.com/pU2LIr7DP0\n\n— СБ України (@ServiceSsu) December 15, 2025\n\nThe post-strike imagery shows that the Improved Kilo class submarine, also known as a Project 636.3 Varshavyanka class type, is in the same position as it was before the attack. Two other submarines that were moored nearby when the attack occured have moved. Other submarines and ships are still in the moorings, including on the outside edge of the damaged pier.\n\nSome of the imagery available now suggests that the submarine that was attacked may now be sitting lower in the water, but that can’t be readily confirmed. Any damage below the waterline would also not be visible in the images. At the same time, there are also no clear signs of any emergency measures having been taken to keep it afloat, or to contain the leakage of oil or other potentially hazardous fluids, as one might expect to see if the damage was severe.\n\nBased on the estimated length of what is visible of the submarine, some observers have noted that the epicenter of the explosion looks to have been less than 65 feet from the stern. The size and configuration of the Sub Sea Baby’s warhead, as well as other details about the UUV and its capabilities, remain scant.\n\nSatellite imagery shows the aftermath of a strike by a Sea Baby underwater drone against a submarine pier in the port of Novorossiysk.\n\nAccording to the image, the strike occurred approximately 20 meters from the stern of a Project 636 Varshavyanka-class submarine, which remains… https://t.co/SVecegvkeD pic.twitter.com/fxOicR5AAW\n\n— OSINTWarfare (@OSINTWarfare) December 16, 2025\n\nTo note, the stern section of Kilo-class submarine remains submerged so presumably it was even closer than 20 meters.\n\nHighly probable that at least the propelled end got affected in a kinetic way.\n\n(satellite imagery I've used is not recent and used for illustration purposes… https://t.co/fwO0UldAZs pic.twitter.com/qxNHs2AEQf\n\n— Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) December 16, 2025\n\nIt’s also worth noting that wider views of the port of Novorossiysk following the attack show four Project 636 submarines still present. There is nothing definitive to indicate that the targeted boat might have been replaced by another to conceal the extent of the damage.\n\nSatellite reveals that four Kilo-class submarines are docked at the Novorossisk port in Russia. One of them appears to have a slightly different waterline compared to the other three. Ukraine claimed that its underwater UV launched an attack on the area via Mizarvision #OSINT pic.twitter.com/k1DLtOcloL\n\n— GEOINT (@lobsterlarryliu) December 16, 2025\n\nFor its part, the Russian Ministry of Defense had unsurprisingly denied that any damage was inflicted on the submarine or to any personnel at the port. The ministry has released a video that it claims shows the undamaged boat, but does not offer a view of the stern end. The background is also heavily censored. Even so, it does still reveal what looks like piles of broken concrete debris left on the pier after the explosion, which was clearly visible in the SBU’s video of the attack, as well as in the satellite imagery available now.\n\nRussia shows footage of a Project 636.3 Improved Kilo-class submarine docked in the Novorossiysk Naval Base to deny Ukraine's claims about successful attack with an unmmaned underwater vehicle (UUV) on it. https://t.co/8molL3Fc2y pic.twitter.com/tECFkjknkM\n\n— Status-6 (Military & Conflict News) (@Archer83Able) December 16, 2025\n\nIt looks like there are piles of concrete debris left on the pier after the explosion. pic.twitter.com/h2NvDi0jkC\n\n— Capt(N) (@Capt_Navy) December 16, 2025\n\nThe press service of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, which operates the submarine, also denies any damage to its vessels. This is also consistent with reports from various Russian naval monitoring channels on social media, but clear corroborating evidence has yet to emerge.\n\nOverall, at this stage, we still cannot say with any authority what degree of damage, if any, the submarine may have actually sustained.\n\nOn the other hand, the attack does show Ukraine was at least able to slip a UUV into a heavily defended harbor, in daylight, and detonate its warhead only a few dozen or so feet away from a prized Russian submarine worth, according to the SBU, around $400 million.\n\nAt least one Ukrainian UUV was therefore notably able to penetrate past barriers erected at the mouth of the port, intended specifically to protect the vessels within. It’s worth noting, however, that the defensive barriers Russia has already built around ports were primarily put there in response to Ukraine’s uncrewed surface vessel (USV) campaign. This underscores the significance of the use of a UUV in this attack, as another example of the steady adaptation of weapons systems and tactics in response to countermeasures that has become a particular hallmark of the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nWith that in mind, Russia is likely to introduce new countermeasures against this particular mode of attack, one which Ukraine has spent some time developing.\n\nThe results of yesterday’s attack, while inconclusive for now, will likely spur further such developments in Ukraine, as well. Before SBU targeted the submarine in Novorossiysk, Ukraine had unveiled a UUV dubbed Marichka, designed to launch kamikaze attacks against ships and maritime infrastructure. At least one other Ukrainian UUV, known as Toloka, has previously been disclosed. It’s unclear if either of these has any relationship to the Sub Sea Baby.\n\nFurthermore, the attack confirms that the Black Sea Fleet is very much still a prime target for Ukraine. This applies especially to the submarines like the Project 636 types and corvettes that are able to launch Kalibr long-range cruise missiles. These weapons have been regularly used in Russia’s nightly barrages launched against targets across Ukraine.\n\nAlready, Ukrainian naval actions had forced the Black Sea Fleet to retreat from bases on the occupied Crimean Peninsula to Novorossiysk. Attacks in Crimea were also prosecuted against another Improved Kilo class submarine. In September 2023, the Rostov-on-Don was severely damaged during a combined missile and USV attack on Sevastopol. Ukraine later claimed it was destroyed.\n\nAt the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Black Sea Fleet had a total of six Project 636 submarines available.\n\nOther navies around the world will likely have watched yesterday’s attack with interest.\n\nAs well as the United States, China and many other nations are developing their own UUVs for missions like this one.\n\nUUVs are able to attack vessels and other targets at long distances and can be launched from submarines and motherships, further extending their range. They can also be used for surveillance and mine laying, among other duties. You can read more about these vessels in various TWZ stories here.\n\nUltimately, whether or not the Russian submarine was damaged, the attack has demonstrated once again that the war in Ukraine is a crucible for the development of new military technologies, especially uncrewed ones.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "Automakers Hyundai and Kia must offer free repairs to millions of models under a settlement announced Tuesday by Minnesota's attorney general, who led an effort by dozens of states that argued the vehicles weren't equipped with proper anti-theft technology, leaving them vulnerable to thefts.\n\nUnder the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with a key piece of technology called an engine immobilizer and pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.\n\nThe settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.\n\nThefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because beginning in 2021, videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable. Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022. Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.\n\nEllison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.\n\n“This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,” Ellison said at a news conference.\n\nHe was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents’ vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times — as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.\n\nUnder the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.\n\nEligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.\n\nIn separate statements, the automakers said the agreement is one of multiple anti-theft efforts they have taken to help customers.\n\n“Kia is eager to continue working with law enforcement officers and officials at federal, state, and local levels to combat criminal car theft, and the role social media has played in encouraging it, and we remain fully committed to upholding vehicle security,” the company said.\n\nHyundai said, “We will continue to take meaningful action to support our customers and ensure peace of mind.”\n\nDura reported from Bismarck, North Dakota.",

    "description": "Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday responded to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles calling him a conspiracy theorist in a recent Vanity Fair story.",
    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday responded to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles calling him a “conspiracy theorist” in an explosive new Vanity Fair story.\n\nThe political world was rocked by Wiles’s explosive tell-all with the outlet. In it, she referred to Office of Budget and Management Director Russell Vought as a “right-wing absolute zealot,” claimed that President Donald Trump had “an alcoholic’s personality,” and even denied Trump’s previous claims that former President Bill Clinton visited Jeffrey Epstein’s private island.\n\nWiles also called Vance’s support for Trump “sort of political,” and added that the vice president had been “a conspiracy theorist for a decade.”\n\nHours after the story went live, Vance was at an event in Pennsylvania to speak about the economy. When it was opened up to questions, Vance was asked for his thoughts on Wiles’s characterization of him. The vice president said:\n\nI haven’t looked at the article. I, of course, have heard about it. But, conspiracy theorist — sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true. And, by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time.\n\nFor example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask 3-year-olds at the height of the Covid pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. You know, I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job. And I believed in the conspiracy theory that Joe Biden was trying to throw his political opponents in jail rather than win an argument against his political opponents.\n\nSo, at least on some of these conspiracy theories, it turns out that a conspiracy theory is just something that was true six months before the media admitted it, and that’s my understanding.\n\nQ: Susie Wiles referred to you as a \"conspiracy theorist\" and your transformation into a Trump supporter as \"an act of political expediency.\" Your response?\n\nJD VANCE: Sometimes I am in conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true pic.twitter.com/ySghDjMgDz\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nAlthough Vance downplayed the article, he later suggested the White House will make themselves less accessible to mainstream media outlets because of it.\n\n“And the last thing I’ll say is if any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article,” Vance continued, “I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews mainstream media outlets.”\n\nJD Vance: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope it's that we should be giving fewer interview to mainstream media outlets\" pic.twitter.com/6d8LoEIXWD\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nHe also reaffirmed his support for Wiles, stating that he had never seen her be disloyal to the president.\n\nVANCE: I've seen so many people who will say one thing to the president's face and then will do the exact opposite behind the scenes–\n\nGUY IN CROWD: They're traitors!\n\nVANCE: They are. And you know why I really love Susie Wiles? … I've never seen her be disloyal to the… pic.twitter.com/dxq8cS54XH\n\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) December 16, 2025\n\nThe post JD Vance Fires Back — Says He Hopes Trump Admin Has Learned ‘Lesson’ After Susie Wiles Called Him a ‘Conspiracy Theorist’ in Vanity Fair first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The president said he is weighing an executive order on the issue.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump reiterated that he is “very strongly” weighing an executive order that would reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said he is looking into the move, adding that “a lot of people want to see” it happen.\n\n“It leads to tremendous amounts of research that can’t be done unless you reclassify,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “So, we are looking at that very strongly.”\n\nMarijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I substance, meaning it has “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The classification puts the drug on the same level as heroin, LSD and ecstasy.\n\nSeveral outlets reported that the White House is weighing whether to list marijuana instead as Schedule III, which is defined as “drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.” Examples include Tylenol mixed with codeine, ketamine and testosterone.\n\nAccording to a YouGov poll from October 2024, 69% of registered voters back reclassifying marijuana to a less restrictive drug category, including 51% of Trump supporters and 86% of supporters of former Vice President Kamala Harris. A Morning Consult poll from August found that roughly three in five voters, or 61%, support reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug under federal law.\n\nTrump’s statement follows his broad declaration of support for changing federal policy on the drug while on the 2024 campaign trail. Two months before the election, he said he intended to vote in favor of an amendment that would legalize marijuana for recreational use in his home state of Florida.\n\n“As I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform. “We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product.”\n\nFormer President Joe Biden’s administration also proposed moving the drug to the Schedule III category, though it did not come to fruition by the end of his term. Last year, the Justice Department recommended shifting cannabis to Schedule III, which prompted a formal review by the DEA.\n\nTrump’s announcement drew reactions from both sides of the political aisle.\n\n“Praying that somehow President Trump does not go forward with [this],” Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham wrote on X on Tuesday.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.) told NewsNation on Monday that “I think rescheduling marijuana is wrong.”\n\n“The fact is, marijuana is a gateway drug,” Lawler said. “Most of the people who end up using hard substances start out on marijuana.”\n\nWhile Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) previously urged Trump to loosen restrictions on marijuana, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said that the president “will try to gaslight everyone into believing he just made pot legal.”\n\n“He has not decriminalized cannabis or expunged the records of black and Latino Americans stuck in prison for minor drug offenses,” Wyden wrote on X. “This is just an attempt to boost his pathetic approval ratings.”\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Trump met privately last week with marijuana industry executives, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mehmet Oz, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to discuss a plan on relaxing some federal restrictions on the drug. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) joined via a phone call, the outlet first reported.",

    "description": "Did a secret society of Confederate allies really bury gold bars stolen from the U.S. Mint?",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nEditor’s Note: This is one of Popular Mechanics’ greatest stories. It was initially published in March 2022.\n\nWe climb in the humid afternoon up a rutted and overgrown logging road, the sky mostly sealed off by a canopy of tree branches, sunlight leaking through dense greenery in elongated shafts. The hike up Dents Run is not quite a half mile long, but the six representatives of Finders Keepers LLC, a Pennsylvania-based treasure-hunting business, string out as climbers on Everest. Co-owner Denny Parada, 69, brings up the rear, hobbling a bit and breathing forcefully. He’s wearing a Finders Keepers polo and a camo baseball cap and shorts and has a handgun strapped to his hip. “Snakes,” he’d explained.\n\nDents Run is an unincorporated community in Benezette Township in rural Elk County, in northwestern Pennsylvania. We’re on a wooded slope, one knobby vertebra among thousands along the spine of the Appalachians. The overgrown road we’re ascending, known locally as Snooks Trail, is a lingering scar from a decades-old logging operation, though most recently it has served as the access point to Parada’s lifelong obsession.\n\nAbout halfway up, Denny’s 37-year-old son and business partner, Kem, hollers and points. An elk is perched on a steep slope above the trail, 50 feet up. It stands unmoving, staring us down, as the group stops to gaze back. A few of us snap photos and turn uphill; the elk stays locked on us as we trudge away.\n\nAnyone who is inclined to anthropomorphize might infer some type of omen in this. Dents Run has an enigmatic history—a lump of new-growth forest that’s unremarkable in every way, except that it birthed a tale of, among other things, a psychic, a cache of buried gold, Confederate sympathizers, an army of FBI agents, and a furtive overnight dig.\n\nOnce we reach our destination, Parada points to the slender cave opening that first propelled his quest, and the location maybe 15 yards away where four years ago the FBI authorized a sizable excavation. Parada is a paunchy nub of a man with a gray mustache and goatee. He uses an early-aughts-style flip phone and chews tobacco. His recitations of his exploits blend boyish wonder with the copious f-bombs of a case-hardened cynic. At the moment, he’s describing the extensive testing he did on this very ground to confirm the presence of gold.\n\n“I just think beyond any other treasure hunters,” he says, “because… I’m not going to claim I’m smart, but I do more experiments than anybody.”\n\nAs he speaks, Dwayne Kelly, a member of Parada’s entourage of full-timers, part-timers, and volunteers, is circling a nearby slope with dowsing rods. Parada describes Kelly as a kind of savant with this ancient if scientifically debunked method of searching for underground metal.\n\n“I need everybody’s opinion here,” Kelly says. The rest of the group clusters around him.\n\n“He’s finding something,” Denny notes, but then continues with his recounting of events from years earlier. Before he gets much further, Warren Getler splits away and joins us. Getler is the group’s default scholar, an expert in geophysics and buried Civil War treasure. “We think there’s something going on,” he says. “Look at the similarity to this up there. And look, the potential tunnel right there. We’re getting a strong signal.”\n\nThey begin scanning the site with a Discovery Treasure-Finder 900, a metal detector capable of locating objects as deep as 12 feet underground. Denny ejects a wad of Skoal-tinted saliva. “Dwayne, what did you do?” he shouts in mock exasperation, holding his arms wide.\n\n“I’m making you rich, buddy,” Kelly calls back.\n\n“He does this constantly to me,” Parada says.\n\nLater, he says, grinning, “You’re actually on a treasure hunt. I didn’t expect this to happen.”\n\nIt’s maybe the most surprising thing he’s said all day. This is Parada’s stock in trade, after all, and his adventures on Dents Run have gained traction in newspapers and on television worldwide. But treasure hunting is the longest of long games, and whether Kelly has actually found anything will not be determined today—or, most likely, anytime soon.\n\nAs with just about everything Parada gets involved with, the answers are tantalizingly close—just a few feet below ground—but just out of reach.\n\nThe drama at Dents Run started, as these stories do, with a fortuitous meeting. It was March 1974. Denny Parada, a native of nearby Philipsburg and a recent graduate of commercial-art school, had taken a job at a W.T. Grant department store, but his passions lay elsewhere. His grandmother was an antiques dealer, and he was fascinated with old objects, including a mysterious river stone he’d found as a child and kept. He thought it might be a Native American artifact. “I always loved this kind of stuff—historical stuff,” he says.\n\nIn his 20s, Parada bought treasure-hunting magazines and, during idle weekend hours, began sleuthing the mysteries they posed. One article in particular caught his attention because it was fascinating, and it was local: the legend of Dents Run gold.\n\nThe story has tentacled off in various ways over generations of retellings, and details have been added or amended over time. But the essence of the saga, as recounted in a 2019 Mt. Zion Historical Society booklet, remains the same. In 1863, the U.S. government’s War Department authorized a shipment of 50-pound gold bars—26 in all—from San Francisco to the Philadelphia Mint to finance the war effort. To avoid Confederate activity, the supply wagons carrying the gold were diverted from a route across southern Pennsylvania into the hilly, forested north. Following the advice of a local guide, the commander, Lt. James Castleton, and his sergeant, Mike O’Rourke, attempted a shortcut over the mountains using an 1842 map titled “Wildcat Country.”\n\nThings quickly went sideways. The logging road they were on led to a trail junction that wasn’t shown on the map. They picked the most promising option, but that petered out, leaving them to navigate a wilderness of tall virgin pines. Eventually they encountered a steep hillside that the wagons couldn’t navigate. The decision was made to send for help, pack out as much gold as possible, and bury the rest.\n\nMost of the men went missing, and the gold never arrived in Philadelphia. Pinkerton detectives who were dispatched to investigate never recovered the cache (although they did find two and a half bars). The National Archives holds no record of the shipment, but the legend of the lost gold “has captivated the attention of thousands of people over the past 150 years,” the historical society reports. And waves of fresh ambition, fortified by the forward march of metal-detecting technology, have continually fueled new searches.\n\nDennis Parada was just another dreaming amateur in 1974 when his employer hired Michael Malley—who performed at the time as the psychic Professor M.G. Malley—to present a “delightfully entertaining ESP presentation.” Parada missed the presentation during his shift in the furniture department. He thought the notion of a psychic was ridiculous anyway.\n\nHe was on his lunch break when Malley wandered by. Parada brandished a copy of Treasure Magazine with the Dents Run story, so one of his colleagues asked Malley whether he could help locate the gold. “What I’m about to tell you next,” Parada says of this encounter, would “change our lives forever.”\n\nMalley ran a finger over the article while Parada stood behind him thinking, What a bunch of bullshit. But Malley then went into a trance and began speaking in voices—Parada believes they were soldiers who’d lost the fateful gold shipment. Malley picked up the atlas Parada had with him, and with eyes looking toward the ceiling, brought a pen down on a spot where he instructed Parada to go. Later, using a soil sample Parada had collected, Malley told him to look for a cave entrance.\n\nParada became a believer, but the search ran aground when he was unable to locate the cave. He became preoccupied with life—opening several businesses, including an antique-furniture store, and raising a family. But he never forgot Dents Run; Kem, born in 1985, grew up hearing bedtime stories about that gold.\n\nFast-forward 30 years. It’s 2004, and Denny is sitting in a bar watching TV with a friend, Scott Farrell. The show is about treasure hunting, and it reminds him of Dents Run. Farrell asks Parada whether he wants to take another look. Soon afterward, they hike up the hill and Parada waves in the direction of the purported cave. Before he gets far looking further uphill, Farrell yells that he found something. “Don’t joke with me, Scott,” Denny calls back.\n\nBut Farrell (who has since died) had found it: a horizontal slit of an entrance on the slope below the logging road, just wide enough for a person to crawl in. Parada surmises that work crews had inadvertently sealed over the entrance when constructing the road, and erosion over subsequent decades had opened it back up. A trickle of water leaked from the opening.\n\nInside the grotto, Parada says, they found a hand-built wall of stacked stones. Their flashlight beams played over scorch marks on the ceiling, apparently from a torch. They later discovered Civil War-era bullets and other artifacts nearby, adding to their suspicion that troops had visited the site during the conflict.\n\nMalley had advised them that the cave was 32 feet deep. The stacked-stone wall was at 15 feet, but later Kem Parada was able to remove enough stones to find a second chamber behind it—and that one was also 15 feet deep. At the back of that chamber they located a shaft, but further excavation posed too much of a cave-in risk, so they backed off. The cave was muddy and damp—a claustrophobe’s nightmare—but the Paradas were exultant, feeling they were close to finding something, possibly the mythical cache of gold. Focusing on the ground above, they investigated further using a metal-detecting device called a GPL 200. (GPL stands for “ground penetrating locator.”) The user embeds stakes connected by wire around a plot of ground. By pulsing electrical current through the stakes, the device gauges the presence of metals and minerals below, based on how strongly the underground elements oppose—or “resist,” in geophysical terms—the charge. Gold, silver, and copper are highly conductive, so the lower the resistivity reading, the higher the odds that they’ve been discovered.\n\nThe Paradas’ GPL revealed a highly conductive metal mass just off to one side of the underground chamber. They also tested the site using ground-penetrating radar. That device emits radio frequencies into the earth’s surface, which then either bounce back or are absorbed, depending on what they encounter. To estimate what lies beneath, the device’s computer calculates the signal strength of the reflected radio waves and the amount of time they took to bounce back.\n\nIn 2010, the Paradas hired Terence Hamill, founder and chief geophysicist of GeoSearches Inc., an Ohio-based firm specializing in subsurface geophysical surveys. Hamill detected “a large metallic anomaly at depth, differentiated from the surrounding geology,” reinforcing Parada’s suspicion that something was there. “We could see that there was something completely different down there, and it could well be precious,” Hamill says.\n\nOver the next nine years, Denny and Kem Parada visited Dents Run about 300 times, capturing more than 100 readings. Kem says the results were unmistakable: “It all screamed gold at this same location.”\n\nWhen they’d first found the cave entrance, the Paradas had been hobbyists—guys out hunting for treasure on weekends and during their spare hours. The site is on state land overseen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and DCNR officials initially seemed unfazed by their activities, signing off on everything they asked to do short of sinking shovels into earth. “They kind of just let us do our thing,” Kem says.\n\nEventually the Paradas became such a regular presence at Dents Run that state officials sent them a letter identifying them as professional treasure hunters. The Paradas embraced the classification by forming Finders Keepers.\n\nBolstered by this veneer of legitimacy, they began to more intensively explore the question of whether they had actually struck gold. They secured permission from the DCNR to drill bore holes from above with non-commercial-grade equipment. “We basically spent years Swiss-cheesing this mountaintop,” Kem says.\n\nAs they drilled their 16th hole, the bit stopped about five and a half feet down. This was odd, because they were typically exploring as far as 12 feet down. They switched out their three-quarter-inch masonry drill bit for a one-inch bit, and Denny switched the machine onto high speed and put all his weight into it. The bit sent up a squealing sound—metal on metal, he says—and stopped dead. He shut the drill down to let it cool, but when he returned after lunch, the bit was so firmly wedged into something that it took two and a half days to extract it.\n\nWhen he finally retrieved the bit, yellowish smears were melted onto the end—a “gold shine,” as he puts it, though there was no way to test for it. At this point anyone would be sorely tempted to just start shoveling earth, but they were committed to doing things by the book. On November 1, 2010, Denny asked the DCNR for permission to drill a two-inch hole into the location and drop a camera inside. This time the answer was no. An official said they needed “to see gold metal on a drill bit in sufficient quantity to convince us” that such invasive procedures were warranted.\n\nThat was when things started to get weird. They’d been leaving their equipment at the site—including a generator and metal detectors—but someone began taking pieces of gear, including trail cameras hanging from trees, GPL stakes, and an extension cord. But the thieves missed one camera, and the images from it stunned Parada: The people removing his equipment were uniformed DCNR personnel. Parada demanded that his gear be returned, and over the course of several heated exchanges, his relationship with the state agency became adversarial. Parada even found evidence that he believes shows that people attached to the agency conducted their own dig on the site, though not in the place he had identified as holding the cache.\n\nThis escalation brought steep consequences. In 2014, the DCNR sent a certified letter demanding that the Paradas cease all activity there. “Once we drove down and hit the gold and had them on site, that’s when things changed,” Denny says. “It’s just big government bureaucratic stuff that pisses me off.”\n\nThat summer, the Paradas took a meeting with a staff member of the Pennsylvania legislature who offered to facilitate a dig permit. The person (whom the Paradas decline to name) claimed to be acting on behalf of individuals in state government—someone who controlled money going to DCNR, and someone working in the governor’s office. But there was a condition: The Paradas had to kick back three gold bars, or 12 percent of the haul, Denny says. He captured the incident on video, and the Paradas’ attorney, Bill Cluck, reported the incident to the FBI, but no one was ever charged.\n\nFrustrated and stymied by the DCNR ban, the Paradas turned to other projects. More than four years passed, and they might have eventually forsaken Dents Run. But then, in November 2017, Denny’s phone rang.\n\nWarren Getler had come across the Paradas’ Dents Run adventure on a treasure-hunting online bulletin board. He was instantly intrigued. Getler had worked as a journalist for the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News, among other outlets, and had coauthored a book, Rebel Gold, about the Knights of the Golden Circle. The KGC, he told Denny, was a quasi-military secret society that took hold in the South and Midwest during the Civil War. Its founders opposed the abolitionist movement and sought to create a new slave-owning nation that encompassed the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean as a counterweight to the North. Operatives looted Union shipments to raise money for the cause, and then stashed plundered gold and silver in various locations around the country. Getler says many of those caches remain intact today—and he told Parada he believed the Dents Run gold was stolen by a KGC-affiliated group in the North called the Copperheads.\n\nGetler opined that while there was likely gold at Dents Run, the fable associated with its presence there is apocryphal. The gold was likely stolen and hidden there, he said, and the story of the lost supply wagons is, in part, a KGC “waybill”—a cryptic, coded message meant to indicate the location of a cache to insiders.\n\nThe Getler-Parada alliance formed with the suddenness and intensity of a thunderclap. They talked nearly every night for the next two months, and came to a powerful realization: Getler’s narrative gave them another avenue for pursuing the treasure. If the gold bars had come from the U.S. Mint, they were federal property. And the Feds could invoke eminent domain in order to dig on state land.\n\nGetler eventually left journalism to join a tech startup that focused on geophysics and subsurface target detection in Washington, D.C. He knew that the electrical-resistivity-sensing equipment Denny was using had certain limitations because the Dents Run soil contained high clay and water content. But the possibilities were compelling—so much so that he offered to arrange a meeting with the FBI to explore a possible gold recovery at the Pennsylvania site.\n\nOn January 26, 2018, the Paradas met Getler in Philadelphia. They ate slices of pizza together, then headed to the U.S. Attorney’s office, where they met two agents from the bureau’s Art Crime Team and an assistant U.S. attorney. The agents spent an hour listening and looking over the Paradas’ stuff. They were initially skeptical, Denny says, “but when I showed them what I had”—including various instrument readings—“they were more convinced.” Getler provided a colloquium on the KGC.\n\nWhen they’d finished, Special Agent Jake Archer told them, “I just want to be clear. If the gold is there, it’s ours. We are going to seize it.”\n\nDenny answered that he would request a finder’s fee, and Archer didn’t object. The agent also indicated that the three men could be on site if the government decided to dig. The next day, Archer called looking for directions, and the Paradas provided detailed GPS coordinates.\n\nOn January 31, the Paradas and Getler met a contingent of seven FBI agents led by Archer at a restaurant near Dents Run. Heading there, Kem noticed an unmarked SUV that appeared to be a law enforcement vehicle following them. He’d been a cop for nine years and knew everyone in the area, and he didn’t recognize it. “It was creepy,” he says.\n\nThe Paradas led the contingent up snow-draped Dents Run, where they generated readings from their GPL 200. They reproduced the test away from the target site, to show the contrast in readings. The agents conducted their own examination using a TF-900 metal detector, and then talked about what kind of earth-moving equipment would be necessary for an excavation.\n\nHicks Run Road, which provides access to the site, is a sparsely populated dirt lane. Garrett Osche lives closest to the site, on a property at the base of the mountain called Pine Valley Camp, which his family has owned for more than 80 years. Osche has tousled gray hair and piercing blue eyes and wore a camouflage shirt with cutoff sleeves. Over the years he’d become friendly with the Paradas, so he allowed the agents to park and change their clothes in his heated garage. When they came down the hill that day, they seemed excited. “They were chirping like a bunch of chickens,” Osche says. Archer, aware of Osche’s presence, shut them down, saying, “We’ll talk about this at the office.”\n\nGetler encouraged Archer to dive deeper into the science of underground detection before planning a dig. He suggested handheld EM-31 and GEM-2 units; these electromagnetic devices have been deployed by the U.S. military in Iraq to locate IEDs and tunnels. The other choice, even more ideal, was a gravimeter—a heavy, boxlike system that calculates the size, weight, and mass of underground objects. It works by comparing an object’s density to the soil in which it sits, and then feeding the data into a software algorithm that spits out analyses in the form of heat maps. The device shows clear contrasts between precious metals and regular soil. Gold, for example, would score a density reading of 18 or 19, whereas sedimentary rock would measure around 2.3. “You can get a pretty accurate depth reading to the center of an object,” Getler says. “It’s very accurate and very sensitive.”\n\nGetler recommended several geophysics companies that could conduct tests, and the bureau chose Enviroscan Inc., a respected firm in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with more than 25 years in business, to conduct a gravimeter survey. Enviroscan’s principal geophysicist was Dr. Tim Bechtel, who in 2020 would be awarded the prestigious Public Service Award by the Geological Society of America. Four FBI agents returned on February 23 with an Enviroscan team, and with the Paradas looking on in a bone-cold, heavy downpour, the crew festooned the site with about 60 marker flags and logged more than 50 readings over two-foot increments.\n\nDuring a three-way call with Denny Parada and Getler several days later, Archer delivered Enviroscan’s findings: The gravimeter showed a mass with a density of 18 to 19—a result that indicated gold. And no small amount, either: The estimate was seven to nine tons. This was far more than the 26 gold bars from the Dents Run legend, which combined would have weighed only 1,300 pounds.\n\nParada’s mind reeled. Getler began bellowing. Nine tons of gold would be the largest land-based treasure in U.S. history—a haul worth $400 million to $600 million. The finding reinforced Getler’s theory that the site was an underground Copperhead depository.\n\nArcher said the FBI intended to get a warrant to excavate the site. He asked Denny and Kem to hide more cameras up there, and to check on the site as often as possible. Just over a week later, on March 10, Archer called again with news: The dig would happen in three days.\n\nThe FBI had worked quickly. Citing the Enviroscan findings and Getler’s historical research, the bureau on March 9 had obtained a federal warrant to dig up the hillside. Archer had written an affidavit stating there was “probable cause to believe that, in a cave on the Dents Run Site, approximately one or more tons of gold belonging to, and stolen from, the United States Mint… are secreted.” In signing the warrant, U.S. Magistrate Judge Richard Lloret had asserted the federal government’s power to push aside the state of Pennsylvania in a quest to reclaim gold that had been lost 155 years earlier. Archer wrote that he wanted to dig in secret, because tipping off state officials “could result in unlawful seizure of the stolen United States gold as abandoned property.” The federal government wanted to grab the gold before Pennsylvania could.\n\nThe affidavit is a fascinating 32-page document. Archer consulted experts from the National Archives, U.S. Mint, and other historical sites. He cited the lack of naturally occurring precious metals in the area, and spelled out the scientific rationale for a dig. The affidavit also reports the incident in which a Pennsylvania official dangled a dig permit in exchange for gold bars, and bores deeply into Dents Run mythology, adopting Getler’s theory that the Knights of the Golden Circle left waybills, codes, and symbols such as circles, rising suns, and turtles on rocks and trees to guide people to caches. Getler said the rock formation above the cave entrance looked like a turtle shell—and turtles are among the most important KGC symbols for gold. Citing the purported leaders of the ill-fated supply wagons in the Dents Run legend, Archer wrote, “It is very likely that Castleton and O’Rourke are fake names, and are in fact, code (Castle and Rook), with Castleton clearly being used as a pointer, as ‘castle’ was the key organizing unit of this secret subversive organization and ‘rook’ was a local unit of that organization.” Although this sounds like a passage lifted from a Dan Brown novel, the KGC is a documented part of the historical record of the era.\n\nHistory aside, Dents Run would have remained a sleepy and largely forgotten fold in the Pennsylvania hills without the Paradas, a team of untrained but hell-bent enthusiasts who had stalked the slopes for more than a decade, lugging equipment purchased at hardware stores. Their business name is taken from a childhood taunt, and their logo looks like a 1960s-style Looney Tunes creation. Stranger still? To this day, Denny credits Mike Malley, the ESP performer, with enabling the discovery—and has offered Malley a quarter of any funds he might receive for the gold.\n\nFor his part, Malley, now 82 and living in western Pennsylvania, says the show he performed for 22 years consisted entirely of staged illusions. “I certainly don’t call myself a psychic,” Malley says. “I don’t believe in psychics.”\n\nStill, on “very rare” instances—once every couple of decades—Malley says he’s able to intuit something. “It’s a certain feeling,” he says. “It’s like, somebody [asks] you, ‘Is it rainy outside?’ And you look outside—yeah, it’s raining. And you’re that certain of it. I can’t explain it.”\n\nMalley, who left show business in the 1980s to sell life insurance and annuities, seems genuinely at a loss to make sense of the Dent Run episode. But he says he’s been able to intuit information about the site on multiple occasions with Parada—starting when Denny handed him the magazine and atlas.\n\nOn the hourlong drive from their home base in Clearfield, Denny and Kem had the opportunity to contemplate the remarkable nature of everything that had happened up to that point. They were with Getler in Kem’s Mazda hatchback, because Archer had ordered them to travel incognito—no vehicles bearing the Finders Keepers logo. But when they arrived, Archer told them to stay in the car—the dig site was too crowded, and as a result too hazardous, to have them standing around.\n\nThe three men took in the scene through the Mazda windshield. The previous day, Kem had gone to check on the site and was surprised to see FBI agents already there. Now 25 vehicles sat at the base of the hill, along with four ATVs, a cargo truck, and a satellite van. At least 50 agents ringed the site’s perimeter. A staging area had been erected, including a green tent housing a command center. Portable toilets had been trucked in. They would later learn that the FBI had hired a local archeologist to provide expertise.\n\n“There was FBI all over that mountain,” Kem says. “It blew our minds.”\n\nHours crawled by with the three men pinned inside the Mazda. Archer stopped by occasionally to tell them to sit tight, saying they’d be able to hike up the mountain soon, but they grew increasingly impatient. When a local TV reporter showed up, agents hustled the trio inside the tent so they couldn’t talk.\n\nFinally, around 3 p.m., Archer led them to where the Paradas had spent countless hours over the years, many of them crawling in mud. About 30 agents wearing blue “FBI Evidence Response Team” jackets stood around a Kobelko excavator. Over the next hour, the machine dug down about seven feet before Archer called things to a halt.\n\nAs the Paradas and Getler recount, Archer said everyone was cold and hungry. “We’ve been here all day working; we’re gonna pack it up for the night,” the agent said. Archer instructed them to return at 8 a.m.\n\nThe three men were surprised, because there was plenty of daylight left. When they returned the next morning under a thin snowfall, Archer reported a glitch: The hole had filled with water, and they needed to check with the DCNR about potential environmental impacts. Once again, the Paradas and Getler were confined to their car, and the mood on the site shifted. Agents who’d previously been friendly barked at them, shooing them from the tent they’d taken shelter in the day before.\n\nAfter another five-hour-plus wait, Archer returned to again take them up the hill. The Paradas and Getler hustled from the car, excitement overriding their irritation—at last, they were about to see the results of their years of work. But Archer seemed downcast, as did the phalanx of agents who ringed the site. FBI personnel who had chatted amiably with them the previous day were stone-faced.\n\nThe Paradas and Getler took in the scene. The hole was free of water and mud, and had been dug 12 or 13 feet deep and about 25 feet wide. Archer asked Denny what he saw. The hole was empty. Parada replied, “I don’t see anything.”\n\nArcher announced, “That’s it, people, there’s nothing here, let’s go home,” Parada recalls. “I say, ‘No, wait a second. There’s nothing here now. It doesn’t mean there wasn’t something here yesterday or the day before. You’re the one that told me nine tons.’”\n\nParada was shouting. “You’re the one that wouldn’t let my guys up here while the dig happened,” he said. “You wouldn’t let us bring equipment.”\n\nAfter Denny vented, Archer ushered them downhill. Denny turned and asked him: “Did you or did you not find gold?\"\n\nThe agent refused to answer. Instead, Kem recalls, “Archer looked at the three of us and said, ‘I’m telling you right now, you don’t go to the media. You don’t put anything on Facebook. You put nothing online. You say nothing to nobody.’ He said, ‘If you do, there’ll be serious repercussions.’ And then he pointed at me and said, ‘and you got your law enforcement career to worry about.’”\n\nAnd with that, they were dismissed. Back at the car, Getler says, “I was literally in a state of shock.”\n\nThey couldn’t make sense of it. Their own extensive testing, and tests conducted by two professional outside firms, all showed the presence of a highly conductive and very dense mass—and even if it wasn’t gold, it was something. “I’ve been in this business too long,” Parada says. “You can have a false reading… If they would have pulled out some scrap metal of any kind, I wouldn’t question it. But to tell me nothing was found? No.”\n\nGetler observed: “When you do 50 scans with a very sensitive and precise gravimeter in five-foot increments, it’s a virtual geophysical fingerprint at that point.”\n\nWhen the Paradas returned a couple of days later with their GPL 200, the mass they had detected scores of times no longer turned up in their readings. The machine showed nothing at all.\n\nThat was eerie enough. Then they began to encounter people in nearby Weedville and Benezette, all of whom asked versions of the same question: “Did you see the armored trucks?”\n\nCheryl Elder knows what she heard.\n\nAs a resident who lives below the dig site, Elder had watched as dozens of federal vehicles rolled past and parked adjacent to her property. At 62, she’d never seen anything like it, and she’s lived her whole life in Elk County, the last 30 years in Dents Run. She served as constable for 20-plus years and had heard about the lost gold since she was a girl; her son had searched the hills with a metal detector.\n\nThe first full day they were there, she says, “I walked up, I was like, ‘What’s going on here?’ You know, you have FBI guys everywhere with their vests and guns and everything—they were guarding it. And he said, ‘Oh, nothing to worry about.’ I said, ‘Well, I live right here, I’m not worried. I mean, there’s enough FBI guys around here—why in the hell would I be worried?’”\n\nOn the night of March 13—in the hours after the FBI had sent the Paradas and Getler home—lights flooded the hillside, and Elder heard heavy work on the slope above: the sounds of a backhoe backing up, the rattling of a jackhammer. “They were digging all night up on that hill,” she says, sitting in her living room. “They had it so lit up that it looked like a city.”\n\nIn the middle of the night Elder called her husband, who was out of town. “I can’t sleep,” she told him. She was awake until nearly 3 a.m.\n\nWhen the FBI pulled out the next afternoon, agents blocked the road. A series of black Hummer-type armored vehicles passed, and in contrast to when they’d arrived, agents ordered her inside her house. She defiantly watched from her garage. “I just stood there with my dog watching them,” she says, “like, what are you gonna do, shoot me?”\n\nElder was baffled to hear the FBI’s claim that the search came up empty. “If they didn’t find anything, then why?” she says. “What was the big deal? Why would you have guards there?”\n\n“I know they found that gold,” she says.\n\nOther residents noticed unusual traffic on March 14 as well. Heather Selle of nearby Weedville told the Paradas that she saw armored cars around 8:30 a.m. as she loaded her child off to school. The vehicles looked like Lenco BearCat-type vehicles, capable of carrying more than two tons of cargo. A local cop called Kem to report that he’d watched armored vehicles, supported by two Humvees and a satellite truck, driving west on Route 555 from near Dents Run at about 10 a.m.\n\nAt Valley Farm Market in Weedville, various employees noticed FBI vehicles parked in an adjacent vacant lot for much of the day, and FBI personnel frequented the store. The shop, which features a variety of model trains and mounted deer heads, is the town’s nerve center.\n\nEmployee Mary Hogan says the FBI seemed to be mobilizing several armored vehicles. “It was an absolute circus in the vacant lot,” she says. “Why were they going through all this rigmarole if nothing was found?”\n\nGarrett Osche also noticed that the authorities had blocked roads in and out of Dents Run that day. “You don’t shut this road down… for two to three hours to send five armored trucks out of here that have nothing in ’em,” he says. The agents, he says, were “very sneaky about it, to put it mildly… As far as I’m concerned, this totally ruined my trust in the FBI.”\n\nGetler and the Paradas believe the vehicles’ movements were orchestrated. In the morning, the armored trucks that witnesses spotted came in after the three men had arrived at Dents Run. They think the vehicles circled around behind them to nearby Hicks Run, where the gold had been stored in SUVs overnight. “They were timing us to know when we’d be off the road so that those armored cars would come in behind us,” Getler says.\n\nThe vehicles waiting at Valley Farm Market were brought in to move the rest late in the afternoon, after the trio had been sent home. “This was done with military precision,” Getler asserts.\n\nThe developments left the rural town scandalized. “This is where we live,” Cheryl Elder says. “I mean, I’ve lived here all my life… How dare they?”\n\nThe worst part, she says—beyond how the Paradas were treated—is the lack of closure. “You’re going to take the gold, but give us the story,” Elder says. “Let us have the final version of what happened here. We grew up with this legend—this myth. Maybe it was real. At least tell us.”\n\nThe FBI issued a terse 44-word statement after the dig that stated, in part, “Nothing was found, and the excavation ended on Wednesday, March 14.” The bureau has said nothing further publicly ever since.\n\nAn FBI spokeswoman refused to make Archer available for questions. “Nothing was found in the excavation,” she declared via email. “The FBI unequivocally rejects any claims or speculation to the contrary. We’ll decline further comment.”\n\nBut the question of what happened on that hill has acquired its own gravitational pull. Emotions run high when people are short on facts. The Paradas’ attorney, Bill Cluck, filed a Freedom of Information request in May 2018 seeking records pertaining to the dig. The FBI initially responded that no such records exist, but later—after Cluck enlisted the help of U.S. Senator Pat Toomey—the bureau conceded that it possesses 2,378 pages of records and 17 CDs of videos. The file is so voluminous that the records won’t be processed for release until around March 2024. In January, Anne Weissman, an attorney who specializes in government transparency and accountability, filed a lawsuit on the Paradas’ behalf, seeking to accelerate the process.\n\nCluck also submitted an open-records request to Pennsylvania’s DCNR, and learned that on the day before the dig, Assistant U.S. Attorney K.T. Newton had emailed DCNR counsel to convey details about the dig. “We believe the cache itself is in the neighborhood of 3x5x8 or 5x5x8,” she wrote.\n\nNewton says the FBI was going with the best information it had at the time—that based on the results of all the testing and surveying, “it was believed that this was the size of the cache. The best we could do was use the best scientific evidence available to us at the time for probable cause: ‘This is what we believe to be there.’”\n\nShe says that turned out to be inaccurate. “The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office would have been more than happy and delighted if we had uncovered what we thought was there, but nothing was found.”\n\nFor the Paradas, surreality pervaded the dig’s aftermath. Maybe the most bizarre footnote: The night the FBI packed up and moved out, Michael Malley, the psychic performer, called Parada to say that he’d intuited something. Both Parada and Getler recall Malley telling them, “They’re moving nine tons of gold out of the country.”\n\nThe next day, news broke that part of a shipment of 9.3 tons of gold had fallen from a cargo plane on a runway in Siberia. According to the reports, nearly 200 bars had come from a mine operated by the Canada-based Kinross Gold Corporation—whose initials happen to be KGC. It was almost certainly just a coincidence, Parada says, but it was still indelibly strange.\n\nThe key question the treasure hunters want answered is this: How did several different scientific instruments that are staples in the geophysics industry—most specifically the gravimeter—all produce false readings? Newton was unable to account for the discrepancy. “We hire reputable companies, the testing is done, this is what the results are,” she says. “It’s never guaranteed. It’s always within—I don’t even know what the reasonable probabilities are—but we can only base it on what the testing tells us. As to what the science is and how that’s done, I am not a geologist.”\n\nThe perpetual questions about what happened are troubling, she says. “It is disturbing for us to have this still being put out there, that somehow the FBI is lying about this—that somehow this huge amount of gold was found, and we managed to spirit it out of that location in the middle of the night,” she says. “What better outcome for us than to say, ‘Look what was found,’ right? As opposed to, for some reason, this allegedly is somehow secreted away somewhere. I can’t figure out what possibly anybody would gain from that.”\n\nWhen I suggest that opening the FBI records might resolve the matter, Newton disagrees. “We unsealed the affidavit, we laid out the basis for what we thought was there, and… there was nothing found,” she says. “So I don’t know what else needs to be put out in the public record on this.”\n\nThe Paradas’ lawyers disagree. “I can’t believe (FBI officials) haven’t bothered to issue a report to the federal court,” Bill Cluck says. “They haven’t bothered to get back to the companies whose equipment was used. Because frankly, I practice environmental law, and I’m not going to trust Enviroscan and this equipment now that I know it doesn’t necessarily work.”\n\nEnviroscan, unfortunately, is barred from defending itself or elaborating on its findings. “We are under quite a strict gag order,” founder Timothy Bechtel replied to an email seeking comment. “I am to direct all inquiries to Agent Jake Archer of the FBI.”\n\nAnd, of course, there’s the issue of the Paradas’ unreimbursed years of work on Dents Run. Cluck says Pennsylvania is the only state that lacks a definitive supreme court decision on treasure troves, and his research indicates that by common law, Finders Keepers has a right to petition federal courts “for their fair share [of the gold], if it was found.” Parada wants a 10 percent finder’s fee—$40 million to $60 million—and he believes a confirmed finding of gold would bring book and movie rights to his story.\n\nBut Parada says money is only part of the equation. Despite the business name he chose, Parada isn’t looking to possess any of his discoveries; he wants various finds returned to their rightful owners, if possible. If gold buried at Dents Run bore the markings of the U.S. Mint, he accepts that it’s government property. And when he leans away from the specifics of Dents Run in his mind, he sees something bigger: Malley’s help, along with other unspecified supernatural occurrences he declines to elaborate on, have convinced him that spirits of the departed help guide his efforts. He believes they want “somebody to come around to find these things and make sure they go to the right place. If souls that have crossed over are helping us, that means there’s an afterlife, and that’s a good thing.\n\n“I know it sounds crazy,” he adds after a beat. “But this is my life.”\n\nMalley feels conflicted about his role in what he characterizes as a borderline unhealthy quest. He’s suggested to Parada multiple times that he let Dents Run go. “It became an obsession, in my mind, of him going after (the gold),” Malley says. “I mean, no matter how hard I tried to talk him out of it, he wouldn’t budge… I said, ‘Dennis, this is too consuming for you; it’s not going to go anywhere.’ And he said, ‘I can’t stop now, Mike.’”\n\nThe layers of irony are unfathomably rich: Parada became convinced of psychic powers—and was propelled in his quest—by a performer who doesn’t believe in psychic powers. And he embraced the FBI in order to solve his life’s biggest mystery—and wound up with an even bigger one. Before, Parada was merely looking for the X that marks the spot; now, the answer resides inside a hall of mirrors—the treasure there but not there, seemingly receding further from him the closer he gets.\n\nParada’s unselfconsciousness through it all is both unsettling and disarming. He’s able to stand apart from his narrative, observe how absurdly unlikely it is, and then use that awareness to argue even more convincingly on his own behalf. Most people in his situation would cave in to exasperated uncertainty; his adversity and lived experience has only ripened into deeper conviction. He has no trouble reconciling the life that he’s lived to the one he imagines. His redemption could always be just a few shovelfuls of dirt away.\n\n“All I want is credit for solving these mysteries,” he says. “So many people have died for those treasures to be there. It’s not ours. The last thing we’d ever do is dig something up and put it in our pocket and never tell anybody. More than anything, I want the truth to come out. I wanna know where that gold went to.”\n\nThe good news for the Paradas is that they always have a new mission.\n\nThe day after visiting Dents Run in summer 2021, the Paradas and Getler take me to another site they’re investigating nearby. After the FBI dig, Denny received a call from a man who had grown up in an area known for harboring unidentified mounds and Civil War-era artifacts.\n\nExploring the site, the Finders Keepers team discovered what they believe are bullets, belt buckles from Union uniforms, and parts of a limber wagon, a two-wheeled cart that carried ammunition and artillery. They also found Knights of the Golden Circle symbols, including a circular stone carved in the shape of a Native American headdress similar to what appears on a copperhead penny. One of the team also found a “turtle rock”—a stone with an image of a turtle on it. Unfurling the map beforehand, Getler points to the spot. “That’s a turtle, no question,” he says. “If you read my book, the turtle always points to the treasure.” Getler also located a waybill—a KGC coded map—that matches certain features of the area.\n\nThe group returned with their array of detection equipment and located more underground metal masses and what appeared, on their instruments, to be a tunnel. Measuring off distances, they created a massive hand-drawn map. These efforts yielded an astonishingly far-reaching theory: They believe they’ve located a buried KGC garrison. Fifteen feet underground, they say, is essentially a military base the size of three football fields. Numerous tunnels lead to as many as 21 chambers potentially harboring Civil War cannons, arms, ammunition, and more. “I think every wagon they hijacked for gold or supplies, they brought back to this camp and buried them all,” Denny says.\n\nIf they’re correct about what they call Copperhead Central, they believe the site will rewrite history books. They theorize that it was the secret rendezvous point for General Robert E. Lee and his troops in late spring 1863—to collect looted gold and link up with KGC militia—when they fatefully ran into Union forces at Gettysburg. “If this is right,” Getler says, “you’re on to the biggest story you could ever imagine in terms of how outrageously wild it is.”\n\nBack in Clearfield, in the low-slung, tucked-away home that serves as the Finders Keepers headquarters, the three men unfold their map, several square feet in area, onto which they’ve overlaid a transparency showing the theoretical KGC compound. Items from Denny’s years of exploration, many of them rusty and crumbling, cover nearly every horizontal surface. A New York Times story about Finders Keepers, which includes a photo of Parada, hangs on the wall.\n\nAs with Dents Run, the Paradas are endeavoring to gird their towering theories with a scientific foundation. They’ve hired a New Jersey outfit, American Geophysics Inc., to scan the location using ground-penetrating radar and an EM-31. On the first of two days at the site, two members of the American Geophysics crew walk the site, flagging the ground at locations indicated by Parada and Getler. Then they scan it with their gear, which includes a 12-foot boom.\n\nGetler and the Paradas buzz with anticipation—but they’re also aware that the science may reveal gaps between their ironclad convictions and the reality of what lies underground.\n\nDCNR District Forester Douglas D’Amore, for one, is expecting the team of treasure hunters to leave the site disappointed. D’Amore is on site, watching and taking photographs, to ensure that the activity conforms to approved activities—scanning, but no digging. Parada regales him with earnest, bubbling-over theories about Copperhead Central, but D’Amore no-sells the pitch, standing with his body angled away and avoiding eye contact. Later, D’Amore offers a detailed alternative theory: Whatever lies underground on the site is far more likely the result of logging operations that were based there.\n\nIt’s not hard to channel D’Amore’s skepticism, trudging among the trees. The surroundings feel like one unremarkable patch of woods among hundreds of square miles of them. And the dynamic between the Paradas and Getler could be read as endlessly looping confirmation bias. Then there’s the zealous embrace of the supernatural and the unreconstructed use of dowsing rods. Yet everyone involved—Denny most of all—argues their case with the ferocity of a true believer. And in his contempt for government interference, Denny tends to characterize any bureaucratic speed bump —for example, the DCNR’s environmental permitting requirements—as evidence of persecution and obstruction.\n\nTheir collective quest exists inside the space where the supernatural meets science, ardent belief meets cold reality, and heat maps meet hard earth. They see themselves as an unstoppable force pitted against a movable object—if only they exert enough sweat and resources. It’s a years-long grind that few beyond the Paradas would countenance.\n\nBut: The American Geophysics crew produces a heat map showing four large, anomalous metal shapes underground, including a 10-foot mass. Optimism pulses through the gathering, and the Finders Keepers crew, feeling exultant, convinces D’Amore to try the dowsing rods.\n\nAfter receiving the final results from American Geophysics, the Paradas ask the state of Pennsylvania to excavate the site. When several months pass with no answer, Parada looks into obtaining permits to start digging, in the hope that a remarkable discovery will prompt an official entity—a museum or university—to take over.\n\nFor now, that leaves the Paradas in a kind of treasure-hunter limbo. If the truth emerges that tons of gold bars were on that Pennsylvania hillside, the story of their ardent and tenacious journey will become just as mythical and enduring as the cache of precious metal. Somehow, the scaffolding of belief they built around the site held up across more than a decade of gale-force bureaucratic headwinds.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the point of the bizarre tale of Dents Run. Maybe the truth of the gold—tantalizing though it may be—doesn’t really matter. Maybe what’s important is the manner in which Denny Parada embodies the yearning, the quest—the believing—for objects that transport us, time out of mind, to distant people and times. Who doesn’t yearn to follow the map to the mythical X, to crunch through the woods, staring at the ground, wondering what mysteries it holds?\n\nOf course, the most likely answer is that there’s nothing down there. But what if?\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Bank of America's latest survey of fund managers shows that bullishness is running high as the market heads into 2026.\n\nAnalyst Michael Harnett on Tuesday highlighted the findings from the bank's latest survey of 238 fund managers, which showed the group is the most bullish they've been in three-and-a-half years.\n\nThis widespread optimism stems from the view that the US will avoid a recession that some bears have predicted and achieve a soft landing as macroeconomic conditions hold up and continue to support the market.\n\nBofA's survey also found that cash levels among fund managers have fallen to their lowest level on record, demonstrating high investor participation in the market. Cash is down to 3.3% from 3.7% in the latest report.\n\n\"Our broadest measure of FMS sentiment, based on cash level, equity allocation, and global growth expectations, rose to 7.4 from 6.4, the highest level since Jul'21,\" he said.\n\nThe survey showed that 57% of fund managers expect the economy to cool while only 3% believe that a recession is looming, a record low for that figure. Thirty-seven percent don't expect the economy to slow at all.\n\n\"On the macro…FMS global growth expectations rose to the most optimistic level since Aug'21 (net 18%, up from net 3%),\" Harnett added.\n\nThe number of fund managers who expect corporate profits to rise reached 29%, the highest since April 2021. Harnett noted that the survey respondents see the AI bubble bursting or a private credit-related crash as the biggest tail risks for the market.\n\nHe added that fund managers also see potential danger in the most crowded trades, specifically in the leading tech stocks of the Magnificent Seven. This is in keeping with the recent sentiment from market pundits that investors should start to look for opportunities outside the AI trade in 2026.",

Now, OpenAI has answered.\n\nThe ChatGPT creator announced the rollout of a new flagship image generator on Tuesday, which the company says is capable of making faster, more precise edits to an AI image while maintaining details.\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Images, powered by our flagship new image generation model.\n\n- Stronger instruction following\n- Precise editing\n- Detail preservation\n- 4x faster than before\n\nRolling out today in ChatGPT for all users, and in the API as GPT Image 1.5. pic.twitter.com/NLNIPEYJnr\n\nBut the more eye-catching change for many user will likely be the improvements to image quality and the AI model's ability to follow specific instructions.\n\nOpneAI said the new model offers \"clear improvements across a range of cases.\" In one example, the company showed off the differences between the old and new image model when prompted to generate a photorealistic scene in 1970s Chelsea, London.\n\nIn another example touting use cases for businesses using the company's image API, OpenAI compared the outputs showing a mechanic working on a car.\n\nWhile a model's ability to generate photorealistic images has become a popular point of comparison in the AI race, OpenAI's latest model can also generate animated images, graphics, and other styles of artwork.\n\nPerhaps to boost awareness of that, the company is rolling out a new Images feature within the ChatGPT app. While AI image generation was previously available within ChatGPT, OpenAI says the new dedicated Images feature is designed to \"spark inspiration and make creative exploration effortless.\"\n\nThe news comes just over three weeks after Google released its Nano Banana Pro AI image model alongside its flagship Gemini 3 LLM — both of which have received widespread praise and reignited the debate around whether Google had begun to overtake OpenAI in the AI race.\n\nGoogle's new AI image generator was lauded for its hyper-realistic AI images, which some people used over Thanksgiving to make it appear as if they had famous guests at the holiday dinner table.\n\nYuchen Jin, the cofounder and CTO of the startup Hyperbolic Labs, called OpenAI's new model \"Nano Banana Pro level in my tests.\"",

    "fullText": "Collectors paid a pretty penny to get their hands to get the very last minted pennies.\n\nStack's Bowers Galleries, a specialized coin auction site, said it sold 232 three-coin sets featuring some of the final pennies ever struck for a grand total of $16.76 million.\n\nThese coins aren't like the ones stuck between your couch cushions or floating around in a junk drawer. One coin was struck at the Philadelphia Mint, one was struck at the Denver Mint, and the final coin was a special 24-karat gold penny. Each of the final pennies also bears a small \"Ω,\" the Greek letter of Omega, further signifying the end of an era that stretches back to the establishment of the US Mint in 1792.\n\nAccording to the auction site, the roughly $17 million is a record for special coins sold on behalf of the United States Mint.\n\n\"They captured the public imagination like few rare coins we've ever handled,\" Stack's Bowers Galleries President Brian Kendrella said in a statement. \"Even our staff of expert numismatists, who see the world's most famous and valuable rare coins day in and day out, were excited by the chance to handle the very last pennies struck before the suspension of circulating production.\"\n\nIn February, President Donald Trump announced that he had instructed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to halt production of new pennies. For decades, leaders of both major political parties had talked about killing the single-cent coin due to the increasing cost of production. The US Mint reported losing over $85 million on penny production in FY 2024.\n\nIt was unclear whether Trump had the authority to unilaterally eliminate the penny, but ultimately, the administration proceeded with its plans. A 2024 New York Times Magazine report popularized the legal theory that a section of the US Code gave the Secretary of the Treasury the power to effectively discontinue the penny.\n\nIn May, the US Mint made its final order of penny blanks. By November, the final US penny was struck in a ceremonial process aided by Treasurer of the United States Brandon Beach.\n\nFittingly, the final penny auction was broken down into 232 lots, one for each year of the coin's existence. The final lot \"included the very last circulating penny intended for issuance struck at Philadelphia and Denver\" in addition to the canceled dies used to strike the final series of coins.\n\nSet 232 sold for $800,000, or 16 million nickels.",

    "description": "Brooke Parrish was born with Pfeiffer syndrome, a rare genetic condition  affecting her facial features. She gained confidence over the years.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Brooke Parrish, 29, a higher education admissions advisor and TikToker who lives in Louisville, Kentucky. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe doctors in the rural area in Kentucky, where I was born in March 1996, were unsure of my condition when I was born.\n\nThey referred me to a hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, a two-hour drive away, where I was diagnosed with Pfeiffer syndrome.\n\nThe genetic condition — which is caused by early fusion of the bones in the uterus — strikes people differently. In my case, it led to the premature fusion of my skull and elbows, also affecting some of my fingers and toes.\n\nMy parents, Angela and Chip, now 55, relocated to Louisville, where I had several cranial procedures when I was young.\n\nMom and Dad were incredibly supportive. Mom didn't treat me any differently, as if I were fragile. I would climb the stairs just as much as my cousins did.\n\nI tried not to limit myself, despite being challenged by the lower range of motion in my arms. I couldn't lift them beyond my breastbone and could only touch my face with two fingers.\n\nMeanwhile, the pain was intense from the operations and healing.\n\nThere is a difference between knowing that you have a certain condition and accepting the reality of it. I didn't speak about it for years.\n\nIn fact, I internalized it. I never saw myself falling in love or getting married.\n\nThankfully, I wasn't bullied, but the other kids would often stare at me. Between the ages of 13 and 18, I grew bangs to cover my eyes, which were my main concern. I could hardly see where I was going.\n\nThen, as I grew older, I began to gain confidence. My bangs got shorter over the years. It was a sign that I'd become more accepting of myself.\n\nI realized that going through so much at a young age gave me the strength and resilience I needed to overcome challenges. Over time, I began to accept my differences.\n\nI wished I could have given my younger self a hug and told her that she'd become grounded and happy.\n\nWhen I got a job as a cashier at a retail store, I dealt with the stares I got by being super friendly. I'd strike up a conversation, rather than deal with any awkwardness. It worked. People were receptive.\n\nI went on several dates between 18 and 21 because I had a lot of catching up to do.\n\nMy preference was online dating. Unfortunately, as much as I would have liked someone to fall for my personality, I wanted the men on the site to make an initial decision based on my photograph. I was fully transparent.\n\nOne guy I was involved with for a few months couldn't cope with the stares. He couldn't handle what came with someone with multiple disabilities. And that's OK. It's not for everyone.\n\nI met my future husband, Joe, now 30, on Tinder eight years ago. It was cute because, two days before our official first date, he popped into the store I worked in unannounced.\n\nHe said that he wanted to take away the nerves of getting ready and driving to our first date. We walked around the store to get to know each other a little. He was right because our first date was more relaxed.\n\nWe've been together ever since, and our beautiful wedding was in October 2021. I never expected a man to be so attentive and devoted. He does anything for me that I can't do with my arms. He can braid my hair and create updos. He puts on my necklaces and earrings. It's the little things that count, and they're wonderful.\n\nI want people with facial differences to know that, through TikTok, you can feel powerful and proud. I've had an overwhelming response from people with or without craniofacial disabilities.\n\nOne of my pen pals is a 15-year-old with a condition like mine. It's like looking in a mirror. I want her to be strong, open about who she is, and to allow other people to love and help her.",

    "title": "4 takeaways from the final jobs report of the year",
    "description": "Here's what unemployment, wage growth, and other newly released data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed.",
    "fullText": "This week brought a vanishingly rare jobs report on Tuesday after the longest government shutdown in history threw a wrench in federal data collection, and it was a mixed bag.\n\nThe new data emphasized trends we've been seeing this year, including unemployment inching up and a tougher market for many job seekers.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics delayed the report from December 5 to extend data collection and processing after its activities were affected by the government shutdown that lasted from October to about mid-November.\n\nThe new data allowed economists, job seekers, reporters, and more to understand how job growth looked in both October and November; the BLS didn't produce an October jobs report last month. While the report was missing items like the October unemployment rate, it gives us a fresh look at the labor market.\n\nHere are four takeaways from the latest jobs report.\n\nBoth Nicole Bachaud, a labor Economist at ZipRecruiter, and Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, described the job market as still stagnant.\n\nThe US economy added 64,000 jobs in November, surpassing the 50,000 expected. That comes after a big net loss in October, largely because federal workers who took the deferred resignation offered as part of the DOGE job cuts earlier this year finally appeared in the data after the deferment ended.\n\nData published by the BLS last week showed job openings have been trending upward as of October, although they're still far below what job seekers were accustomed to a few years ago. Workers' confidence has also been low, as October's quit rate was the lowest since 2020.\n\n\"Job growth has been very slow over the course of 2025, and it doesn't seem like we've turned around quite yet to translate the pent-up demand for hiring and the recent increase in job openings into actual hires,\" Bachaud said, adding that uncertainty over tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical issues has added to companies holding back on hiring plans.\n\n\"That's the big question mark — when is that uncertainty going to finally ease up?\" she said.\n\nThe better-than-expected growth in November was largely helped by job growth in healthcare, so Ullrich said this \"doesn't show a whole lot of strength in the macro labor market.\"\n\nHealthcare and social assistance sectors together had a net gain of 64,000 over the month. Most industries had a decline or a small rise in employment. Manufacturing, for instance, has continued its ongoing net loss.\n\nHealthcare has been a bright spot throughout the year, and Bachaud said there will still be demand for workers as the population ages. However, it could be challenging for job seekers to pivot into these positions. Ullrich said many jobs in the sector typically require certain training and education.\n\n\"Construction is the other industry that we saw really strong growth in, as there is demand for continued skilled trades,\" Bachaud said. Construction added 28,000 jobs, with the largest growth from specialty trade contractors.\n\nWage growth has gradually cooled and reached the lowest point so far this year in November. Average hourly earnings rose 3.5% from a year ago.\n\nThe generally softer job market has made it harder for workers to negotiate higher wages. Ullrich said physicians have better wage-setting power than roles that aren't seeing a lot of openings and where talent is waiting on the sidelines for a role.\n\nShe said employers can probably offer lower raises to current talent, too, since more people are staying put.\n\n\"If you know people aren't quitting, you might not have to offer them the same bump in pay that you would if the quits rate was higher,\" she said. \"That being said, there's still very tight competition for certain roles.\"\n\nThe October 2025 unemployment rate won't ever be released because that data, typically gathered from a survey of around 60,000 households a month, couldn't be collected during or after the government shutdown. However, unemployment had been trending upward before that, and November was the same story.\n\nNovember's unemployment rate was the highest since September 2021 and slightly higher than expected. Still, the Bureau of Labor Statistics warned of data issues with unemployment and related figures over the next few months due to the missing October household survey, so economists and others will have to see how the rate continues to pan out.\n\nDespite the data challenges, Bachaud said the higher unemployment rate and stickier long-term unemployment, where people have been out of a job for at least 27 weeks and actively searching, indicate that it has become harder to land a job.",

    "fullText": "Caroline Ellison, the former cryptocurrency executive and ex-girlfriend of Sam Bankman-Fried, has been quietly moved out of federal lockup after serving roughly 11 months of her two-year prison sentence, Business Insider has learned.\n\nEllison, 31, was transferred on October 16 from the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut to what's known as community confinement, a Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesperson said.\n\nThat means Ellison, the former CEO of Bankman-Fried's Alameda Research cryptocurrency hedge fund, remains in federal custody but is now either in home confinement or a halfway house, BOP spokesperson Randilee Giamusso told Business Insider.\n\n\"For privacy, safety, and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any individual, including reasons for transfers or release plans, nor do we specify an individual's specific location while in community confinement,\" Giamusso said.\n\nOnline prison records list Ellison's projected release date as February 20, 2026 — nearly nine months early. Her attorneys declined to comment for this story.\n\nEllison reported to the low-security Danbury prison in early November 2024 to serve a two-year sentence she received for her role in the massive multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that led to the collapse of Bankman-Fried's business empire.\n\nShe had pleaded guilty to conspiring with Bankman-Fried — the founder of the FTX crypto exchange and its sister company, Alameda Research — in the $11 billion fraud scheme.\n\nEllison served as the star witness in Bankman-Fried's 2023 criminal trial, testifying that the pair used Alameda to invest billions of dollars' worth of assets secretly siphoned from FTX customers.\n\nAt Ellison's sentencing hearing, US District Judge Lewis Kaplan praised her \"substantial\" cooperation in the prosecution of Bankman-Fried, but said the seriousness of the case still required prison time.\n\nHer lawyers had asked that the judge not impose any prison time, but Kaplan rejected what he called a \"literal get-out-of-jail-free card.\"\n\nBefore she was sentenced, Ellison, holding back tears, apologized and expressed regret for her participation in the fraud scheme.\n\n\"On some level, my brain doesn't even comprehend all the people I harmed,\" Ellison told the court. \"That doesn't mean I don't try.\"\n\nBankman-Fried was sentenced by Kaplan to 25 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of all seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.\n\nThe FTX founder and former CEO remains behind bars at a low-security federal prison in San Pedro, California, as he appeals his conviction and sentence.\n\nBankman-Fried's lawyers have argued that he should get a new trial after prosecutors unfairly previewed his testimony.",

The younger Reiner, age 32, was arrested around 9:15 p.m. PT on Sunday.\n\nDistrict Attorney Nathan Hochman announced the charges during a press conference, saying they would be filed Tuesday. Hochman said the charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty.

    "description": "California's DMV ordered Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" within 90 days, or face a month-long dealership suspension.",
    "fullText": "Tesla may have to rebrand Autopilot.\n\nSteve Gordon, the Director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that Tesla has 90 days to amend its advertising language or face a 30-day suspension from selling in California.\n\nGordon said on Tuesday that the DMV is specifically asking Tesla to change the name \"Autopilot\" to clarify that the company has advanced driving systems, which do not equate to an automated system or an autonomous vehicle. Changes must be made within 90 days, or the DMV will \"enforce the cessation of sales.\"\n\n\"My guess is that they will pursue some remedy,\" said Gordon of what Tesla might do next, \"but the easiest one for them is just to come into compliance.\"\n\nIn response to the DMV's decision, a Tesla spokesperson told Business Insider that this is \"a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Sales in California will continue uninterrupted,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nOn November 21, Administrative Judge Juliet E. Cox made a proposed decision about whether Tesla has misled consumers into thinking its cars are more capable of driving themselves than they actually are, and transmitted it to the DMV for consideration. The document containing the proposal, however, has been withheld from the public and won't be released till December 22.\n\nGordon said during the Tuesday briefing that Cox recommended both a suspension of Tesla's license to sell and to manufacture in California. The DMV, however, decided not to pursue a suspension of the license to manufacture and put a temporary 90-day stay on the suspension of the license to sell for Tesla to make amends.\n\n\"They're very important to the state,\" said Gordon of Tesla. \"We want to be fair to them and give them a chance to see if they can find a resolution now that there is a ruling from the administrative law judge.\"\n\n\"If you look at the Q3 report of this year, Tesla has the top-selling car, the Model Y, in its segment,\" Gordon added. \"We felt that the leverage via the sales channel was sufficient to get compliance.\"\n\nThe notice to Tesla follows a weeklong hearing in July at the administrative court in Oakland. In 2022, the DMV sued Tesla, accusing the carmaker of misleading consumers through Tesla's advertisements and by naming its driver assistance technologies \"Full Self-Driving\" and \"Autopilot.\"\n\nTesla, which had a rocky year, denied that the company had ever tried to conceal the fact that its vehicles cannot fully drive themselves.\n\nThe DMV sought to suspend Tesla's ability to sell cars in the state for at least 30 days and award consumers monetary damages.\n\nThe CA DMV wrote in its complaint that on multiple occasions in 2021 and 2022, Tesla's website advertised its FSD driver assistance system as being \"designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat.\"\n\nTesla's lawyers said during the hearing that the company has always informed buyers that they \"cannot fully rely\" on FSD or Autopilot.\n\n\"Cars with Full Self-Driving capabilities are currently not capable of driving themselves,\" said Attorney Matthew Benedetto, a member of Tesla's legal team, during the hearing.",

    "fullText": "Behold: Ken Paxton will now demonstrate that broken clocks are indeed right twice a day. The Texas Attorney General is notorious for, well, a very long list of reasons. But in this case, he at least appears to be doing consumers a solid: He sued five television companies for using ad-targeting spyware on their TVs.\n\nTexas sued Sony, Samsung, LG, Hisense and TCL for allegedly recording what viewers watch without their consent. The predatory technology, Automated Content Recognition (ACR), identifies the content being played on a device by matching short content fingerprints to a database.\n\nACR is essentially a Shazam for video. Except in this case, its sole purpose is to target your viewing habits to help line advertisers' pockets. \"This software can capture screenshots of a user's television display every 500 milliseconds, monitor viewing activity in real time and transmit that information back to the company without the user's knowledge or consent,\" Paxton's press release says.\n\nAn LG Ad Solutions website boasts how ACR helps advertisers \"target by content viewership, including show, network, app, service or genre.\" Since it works with anything running on the device, it can identify purchases and subscriptions, track gamers' habits and pinpoint users by region, city or zip code.\n\nThere should be a setting on your TV to turn it off. But, as Texas' lawsuit against LG notes, TV software often \"deceptively guides consumers to activate ACR and buries any explanation of what that means in dense legal jargon that few will read or understand.\"\n\nPaxton's press release emphasized Hisense and TCL's home base of China. \"These Chinese ties pose serious concerns about consumer data harvesting and are exacerbated by China's National Security Law, which gives its government the capability to get its hands on US consumer data,\" the statement reads.",

    "fullText": "Strategy added nearly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin for a second straight week.\n\nGrayscale expects Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high in the first half of 2026.\n\nWhile long-term bulls stay confident, technical analysts warn that Bitcoin could fall further before stabilizing.\n\nMichael Saylor’s Strategy added nearly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin for a second consecutive week, doubling down on its long-held conviction in the asset even as prices continue to slide.\n\nThe latest purchase comes as Grayscale predicts Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high within six months, highlighting a widening divide between long-term bullish expectations and increasingly bearish near-term market signals.\n\nStrategy acquired approximately $980.3 million worth of Bitcoin between Dec. 8 and Dec. 14, according to a regulatory filing released on Monday.\n\nThe purchase marks the company’s most considerable weekly Bitcoin accumulation since July and the second consecutive week in which it added more than 10,000 Bitcoin to its balance sheet.\n\nIn a post on X, executive chairman Michael Saylor announced that the firm had purchased 10,645 Bitcoin at an average price of approximately $92,098 per coin.\n\nAs of Dec. 14, Strategy held 671,268 Bitcoin acquired for roughly $50.33 billion, at an average purchase price of $74,972 per Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor’s aggressive buying coincides with renewed optimism from Grayscale, which expects Bitcoin to reach a fresh record high in the first half of 2026.\n\nIn its latest outlook, Grayscale said structural shifts in digital asset investing are accelerating, driven by rising demand for alternative stores of value and improved regulatory clarity.\n\n“Together, these trends should bring in new capital, broaden adoption and bridge public blockchains more fully into mainstream financial infrastructure,” the firm wrote.\n\nAs a result, Grayscale believes the traditional four-year crypto market cycle may be coming to an end.\n\n“Bitcoin’s price will likely reach a new all-time high in the first half of the year, in our view,” the firm added.\n\nSaylor is not alone in maintaining an aggressive bullish stance on Bitcoin despite near-term volatility.\n\nTechnology investor and early Bitcoin advocate Mike Alfred said market sentiment has become overly pessimistic even as fundamentals improve.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever been more bullish,” Alfred wrote on X.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — The State Public Charter School Authority (SPCSA) has taken over a troubled Las Vegas-area school, seeking to correct financial and academic problems.\n\nSPCSA declined last Friday to renew the license for Nevada Prep Charter School, effectively setting them up for closure. However, a document leaked to 8 News Now shows disciplinary issues at the school are also at the center of an investigation.\n\n‘Diddy him and do freaky things’: Leaked report shows bad student behavior at Las Vegas charter school\n\nThe leaked report documented hundreds of incidents of bad student behavior at the kindergarten through eighth-grade school.\n\nStudents threatened to kill other students, were caught vaping or with marijuana, and repeatedly used racial slurs, including the N-word.\n\nIn response, emailed to 8 News Now, SPCSA Executive Director Melissa Mackedon said the disclosure violates FERPA, which stands for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and is under “active investigation.”\n\nAccording to the leaked report, a fifth grader who was listed as a problem child shoved a kid into a wall, pulled down their pants, and said he was going to “Diddy him and do freaky things.” Teachers also said the child’s screensaver was a picture of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nA fourth grader, who had 16-pages worth of complaints, reportedly destroyed classrooms, assaulted teachers, and threatened to kill students. An eighth grader reportedly showed others threatening videos, including one of a beheading with a machete, and said he would do that to them.\n\nMackedon stated over email that Nevada Prep’s “leadership is no longer in place,” and an experienced administrator named Joshua Kern has been appointed to close the school out.\n\n“Mr. Kern has significant experience negotiating with vendors and resolving outstanding financial obligations, which is a critical component of an orderly and fiscally responsible school closure,” Samantha King Powell, the general counsel for the State Public Charter School Authority said.\n\nAccording to documents from SPCSA, Nevada Prep is “experiencing a significant and sustained decline in academic performance over the past two years.” Nevada Prep’s elementary and middle schools went from a three-star rating to one star.\n\nThe State Public Charter School Authority has a meeting scheduled for Jan. 23, 2026, to discuss the next steps for Nevada Prep.\n\nIn response to the disciplinary reports, Nevada Prep told 8 News Now the documents were leaked as a smear campaign and that the kids with bad behavior were transferred out of the school.\n\nAccording to Mackedon, the State Public Charter School Authority intends to reopen Nevada Prep under a new charter organization, Academies of Math and Science. That process would still be subject to approval.",

    "fullText": "The province has said that two deer hunted in B.C.'s Kootenay region have tested positive for chronic wasting disease, also known as \"zombie deer disease.\"\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the province said the two new cases were confirmed in a management zone set up to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious and fatal illness affecting species such as deer, elk, moose and caribou.\n\nThe condition, which has a 100 per cent fatality rate, has been spreading throughout the Kootenay region after being detected for the first time ever in the province last year.\n\nWithin the management zone, the B.C. government requires hunters to submit samples for free testing, and to report sick animals.\n\nThere are also restrictions on transporting carcasses in the Kootenay region due to the disease.\n\n“Protecting B.C.’s wildlife is a shared responsibility, and we are grateful to hunters, First Nations and community partners who are working with us to respond and manage the disease effectively,\" said Land and Resource Stewardship Minister Randene Neill in the province's statement.\n\nThe province says there have been eight confirmed cases of \"zombie deer disease\" in B.C., according to the province, all located within the Kootenays in the southeast corner of the province.\n\nIn its statement, the government says there would be a special hunt in the CWD management zone where hunters would be able to harvest one additional deer, beyond a regional limit of two, in order to support disease surveillance efforts.\n\nLate last month, the province investigated a potential case of chronic wasting disease in the neighbouring Okanagan region. The province said last week that testing confirmed a sample from a deer harvested east of Enderby, B.C., was negative for chronic wasting disease.\n\nThe province is encouraging hunters outside the Kootenays, especially in the Peace region adjacent to Alberta, to voluntarily submit samples from harvested deer, elk and moose.\n\n“Hunters and hunting continue to be the best tool we have to identify and manage chronic wasting disease,\" said Jesse Zeman, executive director of the B.C. Wildlife Federation, in the province's statement.\n\nPrion diseases like chronic wasting disease are a family of rare neurodegenerative disorders that can be found in both humans and animals, impairing brain function.\n\nWhile there is no direct evidence the disease can be transmitted to humans and there have been no cases in humans, the ministry says Health Canada and the World Health Organization recommend people not eat the meat of an infected animal.\n\nPerhaps the best known example of a prion disease is bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly referred to as mad cow disease.",

When Hader told him the conversation was private, Nick allegedly appeared to stand still and stare before \"storming off.\"\n\nAnother source told the outlet that Rob and Michele were \"upset and embarrassed\" about their son's behavior at the party and expressed worries about his health.\n\nEntertainment Weekly reached out to representatives of Bill Hader for comment.\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nAs previously reported, sources told PEOPLE on Monday that Nick and his father had been involved in a loud heated argument during the holiday party on Saturday, with one source recalling Nick \"freaking everyone out, acting crazy, kept asking people if they were famous.\" According to TMZ, the couple left the party following the argument.\n\nRob and Michele — who got married in 1989 after meeting while Rob was directing When Harry Met Sally... — were discovered on Sunday afternoon by their youngest child, daughter Romy, 27. Per a statement from the LAPD, at approximately 3:40 p.m. police responded to a call of a death investigation and found the deceased, who were identified as the longtime couple.\n\n\"As a result of the initial investigation, it was determined that the Reiners were the victims of homicide,\" the statement read. \"The investigation further revealed that Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of Robert and Michele Reiner, was responsible for their deaths. Nick Reiner was located and arrested at approximately 9:15 p.m.\"\n\nNick was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday morning to potentially be formally charged, but as  The New York Times reports, Nick's attorney, Alan Jackson, told reporters at the courthouse that his client had not been medically cleared to be transferred from the jail to the courthouse and that there would not be a hearing.\n\nLater that day, the L.A. County District Attorney announced that Nick will be charged with two counts of first-degree murder for the murder of his parents. If found guilty, Nick could face life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Nick could also face the death penalty, which has been under a governor-imposed moratorium in California since 2019.",

    "title": "Pumas came back to Patagonia—and met penguins. What happened next surprised scientists.",
    "description": "A natural experiment in a national park in Patagonia shows how the return of a large predator can reshape an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "For decades, pumas preyed on sheep from ranches along Argentina’s coast, and ranchers hunted them—heavily.Pumas disappeared from the landscape. Then, in 2004, conservationists established Monte León National Park in the region. As expected, once the hunting stopped, the big cats came back. And when they returned, they found a new player in their old neighborhood: Magellanic penguins.\n\nWhat scientists did not anticipate was that not only would pumas prey on penguins—but that the birds’ seasonal arrival would reorganize how these famously solitary cats move, interact, and hunt across the landscape. A new study published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B documents this shift in puma behavior for the first time and challenges our assumptions about what happens when large predators return to an ecosystem.\n\n“When we start to rewild the land, the species that are coming back might find a system that is a bit different from the one that they used to inhabit 100 years ago—and they adapt to it,” says Emiliano Donadio, science director at the Fundación Rewilding Argentina and a coauthor of the study.\n\n(How a penguin 'massacre' led to historic new protections in Argentina)\n\nThe researchers didn’t initially set out to study this unique predator-prey relationship. Lead author and ecologist Mitchell Serota, then at the University of California Berkeley, was working with Fundación Rewilding Argentina to study how wildlife responds when human pressures are removed from former ranchlands. “I went down to Patagonia to understand restoration outcomes broadly. The penguins weren’t the original focus at all,” he says.\n\nIn 2023, Serota and his colleagues reported that the big cats were actually feeding on the gawky birds. “That interaction was known, but we thought it was minor,” he says. “Maybe just a handful of individuals.”\n\nThe team had installed 32 camera traps across the park and tracked 14 adult pumas (Puma concolor) with GPS collars between September 2019 and January 2023. Combining that data with field observations, the researchers quickly realized pumas were snacking on penguins much more frequently than expected.\n\n“We were getting repeated detections of pumas right around the penguin colony,” Serota recalls. “That’s when it became clear this was not a side note. It was something shaping how these animals were using the landscape.”\n\nBecause Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) spend much of their lives at sea, they are unusual prey for a large terrestrial carnivore whose diet is mostly made up of land mammals, such as deer, guanacos (relatives of llamas), and hares. But during their breeding season—roughly September through April—the seabirds huddle on land in large numbers. At Monte León, more than 40,000 breeding pairs nest along a coastline of about two kilometers long.\n\n(What Magellanic penguins are teaching us about survival)\n\nFor a puma, whose territory can cover hundreds of square kilometers, this creates an odd situation: an extremely abundant food source, concentrated in a very small area, and available only part of the year. The team found that the population density remained similar—around 13 cats per 100 square kilometers—whether penguins were present or absent. So, penguins did not create more pumas, but reorganized how these cats share space.\n\nPenguin-eating pumas, it turns out, behave quite differently from those who prefer other diets in Patagonia. The study found that bird-eating big cats shared the same area much more frequently than non-bird-eating ones and were not attacking each other as often as one would expect. “In other words, penguin-eating pumas were quite tolerant of the presence of one another,” says Donadio, who is also a National Geographic Explorer.\n\nSuch tolerance was a surprise, given the pumas’ loner stereotype. In Patagonia, these big cats are out in the open, as they are the top predator. “Unlike Africa, they don’t need to scrum together to take down prey twice or three times their size. And unlike North America, there are no grizzly bears, black bears or wolves, so these cats are not sneaking around in the trees at night like they are up here,” says Jim Williams, who worked for decades as a biologist with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and wrote about the relationship between the seabirds and big cats in his book Path of the Puma.\n\nTo some degree, it makes sense that pumas pounced on the new food source, as penguins are low-risk prey. “Big cats—lions, panthers, cougars, pumas—always prey on the most abundant and vulnerable food sources available,” says Williams, who was not affiliated with the current study. “That’s not shocking from an ecological point of view or a natural behavior, but it is for people who don't know that penguins and pumas overlap,” he adds.\n\nBut the behavior changes are surprising. “We tend to think of pumas as extremely aggressive and intolerant,” Donadio says. “But when food is abundant and concentrated, there’s no need to defend it. They become more socially tolerant,” he adds.\n\n(What one photographer learned after spending nearly a year with pumas)\n\nDonadio says that, so far, surveys suggest the penguin colony has remained stable or even increased since the park was created. What remains uncertain is how the penguin-driven changes in puma behavior ripple through the rest of the ecosystem—especially to guanacos, Patagonia’s dominant herbivore, and the pumas’ primary traditional prey.\n\nDespite the behavioral shifts documented in the study, some important questions remain. The researchers still don’t know how many penguins individual pumas kill, making it difficult to assess the long-term impact of predation onthe colony, even though penguin numbers at Monte León appear stable or increasing so far. Nor can they yet determine whether the high puma density is a temporary or a long-term feature of the ecosystem.\n\nAlso, researchers still have to figure out the broader ecological consequences of penguin-driven changes in puma behavior. “We know that the penguin colony has changed where, when, and how pumas obtain their food, but the next step is to understand the ecological implications of that change,” Serota says.\n\nFor now, the puma behavior findings demonstrate that when nature is given space, it does not always look back—it improvises. “Restoration doesn’t mean going back to some historical snapshot,” Serota says. “Species are returning to ecosystems that have changed dramatically. That can create entirely new interactions.”\n\nThe nonprofit National Geographic Society, committed to illuminating and protecting the wonder of our world, funded Explorer Emiliano Donadio's work. Learn more about the Society’s support of Explorers.",

    "fullText": "If I could use only one word to encapsulate Terminator 2D: No Fate, it would be \"authentic\": Both in the way it faithfully recreates James Cameron's seminal 1991 action movie and its nostalgic love affair with the 16-bit era of video games. Movie tie-ins were mostly awful in the early '90s, but I could easily see myself renting No Fate from my local Blockbuster and blasting through its sidescrolling run-'n'-gun action in between episodes of Dragon Ball Z and WWF Smackdown.\n\nIt's a brief experience, with the credits arriving in less time than it takes to watch the entirety of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, but No Fate is a licensed video game done right, created with palpable reverence for both its source material and the era of video games it emulates.\n\nNo Fate's story mode opens with a shot of rolling tarmac, as the painted yellow lines in the middle of the road scroll past at regular intervals. If you're a fan of Terminator 2, this shot will be a familiar sight, albeit one now rendered in gorgeous pixel art, with chiptune music and Sarah Connor's monologue presented as blocks of text rather than through Linda Hamilton's hushed tones. It's also in a different place--on a desert road instead of a Los Angeles freeway--and opens the game as opposed to bookending the movie.\n\nWhere it once wrapped up two hours of pure movie-making excellence with a hopeful glimpse of an undetermined and hopefully better future, No Fate warns of the horrors to come--of Judgment Day and the rise of the machines. It's a scene that wonderfully captures the vibe of Terminator 2 while also putting developer Bitmap Bureau's own spin on things, remaining authentic and faithful to the source material with an additional sprinkling of unique flavor on top.\n\nThis is a common theme throughout No Fate's story mode. When it's not a beat-by-beat 16-bit recreation of one of the greatest movies ever made, it's filling in the blanks and professing its love for '90s gaming, fluidly shifting gameplay styles to suit the adaptation's needs.\n\nTake the opening level as a prime example: In a new scene set shortly before the film's events, Sarah is teaching John Connor how to fight so he can become the soldier he may need to be in the future. This moment of atypical bonding is interrupted when a musclebound thug pays homage to Double Dragon by punching John in the gut and flinging him over his shoulder before walking off. What follows is a side-scrolling action platformer with more than a few similarities to the console and early arcade games of the '90s.\n\nAs you move Sarah from left to right, mowing down bad guys by shooting vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, games like Metal Slug, Super Star Wars, and RoboCop Versus The Terminator come to mind. Movement is responsive, and human enemies go down in a couple of shots, making for some satisfyingly fast-paced action.\n\nAfter rescuing John, Sarah heads to a Cyberdyne research lab to destroy it, only to be shot, arrested, and sent to the Pescadero mental hospital: a moment mentioned briefly in the film but afforded more prominence here. With Sarah's plans to prevent Judgment Day foiled, No Fate takes inspiration from Terminator 2's explosive opening scene, putting you in control of a grizzled John Connor as he leads the resistance in the Future War of 2029.\n\nThese levels resemble Konami's Contra series more than anything, right down to a familiar defensive wall boss fight and temporary weapon pickups that grant homing plasma rounds and split shot fire. Bitmap Bureau introduces a few modern wrinkles as well, such as the ability to take cover and an evasive roll for avoiding enemy fire, though the game gets more interesting once you're done destroying the various T-800s, Centurions, and Hunter-Killers of Los Angeles' future.\n\nOnce John reaches the time-travel device and sends a T-800 back to 1995, No Fate transitions to Arnold Schwarzenegger's first appearance in Terminator 2 as he emerges in the parking lot of The Corral biker bar--though it's worth noting that Arnie's likeness isn't included, despite Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, and Robert Patrick all starring. From here, the game begins taking scenes from the film and transforming them into playable levels, nailing every memorable moment while adapting gameplay styles to fit each scene.\n\nAfter a naked Arnie asks for a biker's clothes, boots, and motorcycle, No Fate momentarily turns into a beat-em-up as you clobber The Corral's patrons, throwing one onto a steaming hot grill and culminating in a boss fight set to George Thorogood's \"Bad to the Bone.\"\n\nLater on, the iconic motorcycle/truck pursuit through Los Angeles' flood-control channel draws inspiration from Battletoads' Turbo Tunnel and the bike level from Contra 3: The Alien Wars, challenging you to avoid static hazards while keeping Robert Patrick's T-1000 at bay--complete with one-handed shotgun reloads that are still the coolest. The freeway chase from later on in the film functions similarly but differs slightly, as you alternate between weaving in and out of traffic and taking control of Sarah as she fires upon the pursuing T-1000-manned helicopter.\n\nSarah's escape from the Pescadero Hospital is another highlight, briefly turning No Fate into a stealth game. With the T-1000 hot on your tail, passing through metal bars and melting into the floor, there's a sudden injection of tension since you have no way of fighting back. Instead, you need to duck into doorways and various alcoves to avoid the T-1000 and bide your time before taking out the hospital's abusive orderlies. There isn't an instant fail state if you alert any of the human enemies; it's just easier to take them out with a swift blow to the back of the head, so being spotted is never frustrating.\n\nThis level fits the era, too, even if you might not necessarily think of stealth mechanics when recalling 16-bit games. 1990's Bonanza Bros was the primary inspiration behind No Fate's stealth mechanics, but games like Rolling Thunder and Elevator Action Returns were also influential, showcasing the depth of Bitmap Bureau's love for the era.\n\nWhile your first venture through No Fate's story mode covers the rest of Terminator 2, from blowing up Cyberdyne HQ to fighting off the T-1000 in the steel mill finale, subsequent playthroughs allow you to change the future. After all, the game's title comes from the famous line \"there's no fate but what we make for ourselves.\" The future isn't predetermined, and so the game leans into this ethos, letting you make a couple of different choices to alter events and unlock three alternative endings.\n\nIn practice, however, this sounds more interesting than it actually is. The branching paths introduce a few new levels, including an escape from a police station that feels like an ode to the original 1984 Terminator, but the other endings are brief and, much like the ending in the film's extended cut, can't compare to the original.\n\nAlong with a ranking system, global leaderboards, multiple difficulty settings, and other unlockable modes, seeking out the other three endings adds some replayability to what is otherwise a remarkably short game. My first playthrough took 42 minutes, with that number decreasing with each subsequent completion. The other modes include a Boss Rush, where you try to defeat all of the game's bosses as quickly as possible, and an Infinite mode that tasks you with walking down an endless corridor, killing as many enemies as you can to achieve the highest score. If you're interested in leaderboards, you might get some longevity out of these modes, but otherwise, you'll likely play each of them once just to unlock the rest of the modes.\n\nArcade mode adds an extra challenge by removing continues, while Mother of the Future condenses the story mode to only Sarah Connor's levels, with completion unlocking the hardest difficulty setting. The options are nice, but still just offer different ways to replay the same game. No Fate's brevity is fitting for a time period where most games had to be finished in a single sitting, but if you have no intention of elongating the experience by unlocking every mode, it's unlikely you'll be completely fulfilled.\n\nThose with few qualms about duration will find a game made with evident love and affection for both the source material and the moment in time it was released. Its music is excellent--with perhaps the best rendition of the Terminator 2 theme to date--aiding the game's visuals in its mission to transport you back to a time when blowing into cartridges and inserting coins were the norm. Whether it's the T-1000's haunting fluidity of movement, Sarah Connor's one-armed reloading of a pump action shotgun, or the way the T-800 clambers onto the hood of a semi-truck to unload an entire magazine into its windshield, Terminator 2D: No Fate recreates the movie's most memorable moments with pitch-perfect authenticity. It's a shame it ends far too soon, but this is still the definitive Terminator 2 video game.",

    "fullText": "Fallout returns with a new journey into the Mojave Wasteland.\n\n on December 16, 2025 at 6:00PM PST\n\nSPOILERS for Fallout Season 2 Episode 1: The Man Who Knew to follow:\n\nThe last time we saw Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), The Ghoul aka Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins), and beloved pup CX404, their situation looked dire.\n\nLucy had learned her father Hank (Kyle MacLachlan) was responsible for the destruction of Shady Sands, The Brotherhood of Steel was in a heated battle with the New California Republic over control of Griffith Observatory, and Cooper realized that Hank held the answers to the whereabouts of his family. While Hank slipped out in the ensuing chaos and headed to New Vegas, Lucy decided to join Cooper in his quest for answers, which led them into unknown and dangerous territory.\n\nThe first episode of Fallout Season 2, \"The Man Who Knew,\" opens with a brief Pre-War flashback that shows the public protesting against RobCo industries. The scene then takes us inside a bar where a mysterious stranger (Justin Theroux) manages to taunt a group of unemployed workers about how RobCo industries founder Mr. House is more powerful than the government. They then follow him outside, where he attaches a device to the back of one of their heads in return for millions of dollars. Using this device, he’s able to command the man to attack his friends with a baseball bat, but when the mind-controlled man begins to turn against the mysterious stranger, the device makes his head explode in gory fashion.\n\nJumping back to the present, we see that Cooper is captured in Novac by the Great Khans, one of the factions running rampant in the Mojave Wasteland. But when they’re about to execute him, Lucy reveals herself in an iconic sniper perch from Fallout: New Vegas and exposes their plan to rob the Khans of their bottlecaps. She fails a dialogue check and chaos ensues; Cooper is forced to intervene in bloody fashion, reminding audiences once again why he’s one of the best gunslingers in the Wasteland.\n\nIt’s not long after this fight that Cooper reveals that New Vegas survived The Great War, thanks to a missile system designed by Mr. House, which shot the bombs out of the sky. This includes a brief pre-war flashback in which Cooper learns of Vault-Tec and House’s plans for The Great War. He struggles to get his daughter to safety.\n\nChecking in on the residents of Vault 33 in the present, we find Overseer Pearson (Leslie Uggams), who mentions that the vault's water purification chip is broken. Meanwhile, in Vault 32, Stephanie Harper (Annabel O’Hagan) is adjusting to her new life as Overseer and dealing with the needs of her residents and new arrivals from Vault 33. By her side, with child in hand, is Chet (Dave Register), Lucy’s cousin, who is struggling to adjust to his new role as the stepfather of Stephanie’s baby, and dismayed at the mere suggestion that the child be named “Chet Jr.”\n\nFinally, we cut to Vault 31, where Norm (Moises Arias), Lucy’s brother, is held captive by the robo-brain of Bud Askins, a junior vice president of Vault-Tec Industries, after discovering the vault is secretly housing the Vault-Tec executives from before The Great War.\n\nLucy and Cooper continue to follow the trail of dead bodies left in Hank’s wake. They come across a Starlight Drive-In that’s secretly housing Vault 24. Upon further inspection, they find the vault door has been opened and the inside is covered with overgrown vegetation.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper head inside, we get a Pre-War flashback of Cooper reporting his Vault-Tec findings to Lee Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury), who led the NCR during the battle of Griffith Observatory. Moldaver reveals to Cooper that his wife plans to sell Cold Fusion, an infinite power source, to Mr. House. That and his anti-bomb missile system will make him one of the most powerful men in the world once the bombs drop. Knowing this can’t happen, she asks Cooper to assassinate Mr. House--an event we know now never comes to be).\n\nBack in Vault 31, Norm is growing weaker and weaker from a lack of food and water. Bud offers him salvation in the form of going into Hank’s now-empty cryo chamber. With time running out and with few options, Norm decides to make a rash decision and wakes up all the Vault-Tec executives from their slumber. We see the massive number of chambers begin to open up.\n\nAs Lucy and Cooper explore Vault 24, they come across numerous communist corpses and find Russian propaganda playing. Lucy realizes the corpses are actually Americans who were being brainwashed to become communists, possibly as a result of one of Vault-Tec's many sick experiments on vault-dwellers. Deeper in the vault, they find a Great Khan with a mind control device similar to the one the mysterious stranger used at the start of the episode. He delivers a message for Lucy straight from her father: “I fix everything. Go home, Sugar Bomb.” Before they can react, his head explodes into gory viscera.\n\nElsewhere, Hank arrives at a secret Vault-Tec facility and changes out of his stolen power armor into something a bit more business appropriate. After enjoying a damn fine cup of coffee, he begins to record a message for an unknown recipient, promising that his work will continue. In a display case is the mysterious stranger’s mind control device with what looks like smaller and smaller upgraded models alongside it, ending the episode.\n\nFallout returns with a bang! While we got answers about the aftermath of the battle for Griffith Observatory, the quest into the Mojave Wasteland provides even more mysteries. What’s Hank truly up to? What will happen to Norm when all of the Vault-Tec executives wake up? Why is New Vegas so important? Who is the mysterious stranger who created the mind control device? We didn’t even get an update on Maximus (Aaron Moten) and the Brotherhood of Steel. So while we rejoined our comrades in this exciting new setting, there’s still plenty more to discover as we dive deeper into Fallout Season 2.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.\nTo claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark.",

Its capital city is home to 23 million.\n\nFor context, the population of Liverpool is just under one million.\n\nCome to appreciate that and only then do you begin to understand the scale of national fury that followed when Mohamed Salah gave his incendiary interview on 6 December, claiming Liverpool had \"thrown him under the bus\".\n\n\"This interview was like a revolution in Egypt,\" says Diaa El-Sayed, the former Egypt assistant coach, who has known Salah since he was 16.\n\n\"99% of Egypt supports Salah, and you can see from the reaction at Anfield that the Liverpool fans support him too.\"\n\nAcross British media, Salah was criticised heavily for his actions.\n\nFormer Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher branded the interview a \"disgrace\" and accused the 33-year-old of throwing the club under the bus.\n\nOthers insisted Salah was in the wrong for airing his grievances in public. Yet in Cairo, the 'Egyptian King' can do no wrong.\n\n\"Before Salah, no-one supported Liverpool here,\" says Noura Essam, a Cairo local. \"Before Salah, we didn't have a global figure, so we will always support him.\"\n\nDuring the 2018 presidential election, more than one million Egyptians crossed out the names of the listed candidates and cast their vote for Salah.\n\nHe is an unofficial leader. In these parts, he is known as the 'Fourth Pyramid'.\n\nAround Ramses Square, the Cairo transport hub where Salah would change buses to reach training during his nine-hour round commute as a teenager, the cafe-goers describe their disbelief when he was named on the bench for three games in a row by Arne Slot and then left out of the squad for the Champions League trip to Inter Milan.\n\n\"When Liverpool played in Milan, all of Egypt supported Inter Milan,\" says Osama Ismail, a former Egyptian FA spokesman.\n\nIsmail, who worked with Salah, describes him as \"not arrogant but confident\" and is adamant the forward wants to continue playing for Liverpool.",

Kennedy Jr.’s catastrophic Make America Healthy Again movement, survey the fallout and human cost of the DOGE wrecking ball, anticipate the Supreme Court’s dangerous antidemocratic rulings, and amplify successful tactics of resistance on the streets and in Congress.\n\nWe publish these stories because when members of our communities are being abducted, household debt is climbing, and AI data centers are causing water and electricity shortages, we have a duty as journalists to do all we can to inform the public.\n\nIn 2026, our aim is to do more than ever before—but we need your support to make that happen.\n\nThrough December 31, a generous donor will match all donations up to $75,000. That means that your contribution will be doubled, dollar for dollar. If we hit the full match, we’ll be starting 2026 with $150,000 to invest in the stories that impact real people’s lives—the kinds of stories that billionaire-owned, corporate-backed outlets aren’t covering.\n\nWith your support, our team will publish major stories that the president and his allies won’t want you to read. We’ll cover the emerging military-tech industrial complex and matters of war, peace, and surveillance, as well as the affordability crisis, hunger, housing, healthcare, the environment, attacks on reproductive rights, and much more. At the same time, we’ll imagine alternatives to Trumpian rule and uplift efforts to create a better world, here and now.\n\nWhile your gift has twice the impact, I’m asking you to support The Nation with a donation today. You’ll empower the journalists, editors, and fact-checkers best equipped to hold this authoritarian administration to account.\n\nI hope you won’t miss this moment—donate to The Nation today.\n\nEditor and publisher, The Nation",
