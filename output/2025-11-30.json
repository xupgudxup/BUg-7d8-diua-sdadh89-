    "description": "This note presents an exciting new identification concerning late Roman carved workshop makers’ marks on glass diatreta—a discovery that was hidden in plain sight. This is a preliminary result of a forthcoming comprehensive study of the abstracted, openwork symbols that sometimes accompany an inscription. On glass objects, if mentioned at all in past scholarship, they have been misleadingly referred to only as “stop-marks” designed to ornamentally frame an adjacent inscription. By instead approaching these symbols as imagistic script, a visualized form of the presentation of writing, their communicative purposes can be better recognized along with their producers. Through this approach, two remarkably similar glass openwork vessels—each with an identical symbol—and a possible third vessel with a nearly identical symbol and a related design have been identified.",

The Fortnite-original Melodie Mars skin is unlocked instantly when you purchase the pass, and the Rockstar Lisa skin is the final reward in the pass, she's got a reactive back bling on the pass as well.\nThose Icon emotes--which feature music from Can't Get Enough by Krystal Youngs and NiihWA, and Latata by I-dle--are a pretty surprising inclusion, as there have only been three total Icon emotes included in the previous 11`music passes. To have two of them on one music pass is very unusual.",

But if those folks aren't your speed, fortunately, there are six other skins on the Season 1 battle pass that you can enjoy.\nFour of those skins are just regular humans, including a skater girl named Carina who has blue hair and a cast on her right wrist, who's sure to be an instant favorite. The pass rounds out with Kingston, a laid-back lion man, and a new version of the old Eternal Voyager skin who appears to be related to The Seven somehow.",

The Chapter 7 map includes major locations based on Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Area 51--in other words, it's Fortnite's San Andreas map.\nIt all starts in Battlewood in the southwest portion of the new island, which has its own version of the iconic Hollywood sign and streets lined with palm trees. Nearby, you'll find the sound stages of Sus Studios, and you can take a ride up the freeway--yes, this map has Fortnite's first four-lane highway--to visit the casinos of the Sandy Strip.",

Soon, it'll celebrate a re-release, Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, which stitches the movies back together and adds new scenes, too. But even a movie of its length has scenes left on the cutting room floor. Using Epic's Unreal Engine, Tarantino is closing a chapter of his career that's been more than 20 years in the making.\nTotally separate from the new scenes found within The Whole Bloody Affair, The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge is a roughly 10-minute scene built in Unreal Engine that brings together the Kill Bill series and, unexpectedly--or perhaps not--Fortnite.",
