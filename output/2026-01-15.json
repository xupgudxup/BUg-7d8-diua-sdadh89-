    "fullText": "Barcelona are on top of the Spanish market, which they intend to use to strengthen their ranks in the coming years. The club are not afraid to sign younger players that can be immediately used in the first team, and they have identified a new target in this regard.\n\nAs per MD, Barcelona are one of the clubs interested in Racing de Santander’s Jorge Salinas. The 18-year-old has been a revelation for the Segunda leaders this season, with five assists in league appearances.\n\nSalinas is expected to start for Racing when Barcelona head to the Campos de Sport de El Sardinero, and that will allow the Catalans to launch an in-person scouting mission. If he impresses, there is every chance that a move is made in the summer, although with the teenager contracted until 2029, he would not come overly cheap.\n\nFull-back is an area where Barcelona have had issues over the last few months, which is why Joao Cancelo has been brought in from Al Hilal for the remainder of the season. He will cover at right-back and left-back, with the latter needed due to Gerard Martin being used in a central role by Hansi Flick.\n\nThere is every chance that Martin continues there going forward, including into next season. If that is the case, Barcelona would need a new left-back to compete with starter Alejandro Balde, and Salinas could be the ideal player.\n\nA move for Salinas will not be a priority for Barcelona, given their plan to address the centre-back, left wing and striker positions over the next eight months. Nevertheless, they could be prepared to make their move if the conditions are right, but that would only happen during the summer transfer window at the earliest.",

    "description": "Five days ago, Lane Kiffin and the LSU Tigers had zero quarterbacks. Now they have three intriguing players and one of the best rooms in college football.",
    "fullText": "Just last week, the LSU Tigers had no scholarship quarterbacks on the roster and fans started to freak out. Now, they have assembled one of the strongest rooms in the nation, with as clear a plan for the future as the transfer portal era allows.\n\nAfter picking up their third commit on Wednesday morning, Lane Kiffin is likely done configuring his group. Here is how the quarterback room will look for the 2026 season:\n\nAfter nearly two weeks of searching, meeting and striking out with a couple of options, the Tigers ended up landing what some considered to be the best quarterback in the transfer portal.\n\nLeavitt had some hopes of being a top selection in the upcoming NFL draft, but last year didn't really go as planned. The production was down and a lisfranc injury cut his season short.\n\nLSU has no worry about that dip on the field or that injury. The Tigers will hand Leavitt the most weapons he's had to work with before and Kiffin's teams have become one of the best at developing quarterbacks.\n\nLeavitt has completed 61.4% of his career passes for 4,652 yards and 36 touchdowns to 11 interceptions. He has also run the ball 196 times for 816 yards and 10 more scores. He will be a perfect fit for the Kiffin and Charlie Weis Jr. offense.\n\nLongstreet likely entered the portal with hopes of landing a starting job somewhere, but instead he will remain a backup for this season with the opportunity of learning under Leavitt and Kiffin for a year. Leaving Lincoln Riley isn't something that top quarterbacks are known to do, but this is not a bad spot, either.\n\nWith Leavitt likely heading to the draft next year, Longstreet will be in line to become the starter next season. He was a five-star quarterback in the 2025 class and will have four years of eligibility remaining.\n\nLongstreet is a freak athlete, combining great speed and a very strong arm. It'll be fun to see what kind of player he will be able to develop into.\n\nHe appeared in four games for the USC Trojans this season, completing 13 of his 15 pass attempts for 103 yards and a touchdown. He also ran the ball 11 times for 76 yards and two more scores.\n\nIt was assumed that he was the safety option in case Leavitt went elsewhere, but now LSU gets both. With Peyton Houston coming in as a top high school prospect next year, the Tigers could have their next three starters decided if the transfer portal doesn't break things up.\n\nClark was a three-star transfer and unranked prospect out of high school, but figures to be a top-end backup option. He is known for his cannon of an arm. Kiffin knows what he's doing with small-school, unsuspecting talent.\n\nThe former Elon Phoenix standout completed 56% of his passes last year for 2,321 yards and 18 touchdowns to eight interceptions. He added 189 carries for 614 yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground.",

    "description": "Hear from Washington State Cougars junior forward Rihards Vavers before the Battle in the Palouse.",
    "fullText": "The Washington State Cougars (8-10, 3-2 WCC) had to deal with a plentiful amount of turnover during the offseason, losing the likes of senior guard Nate Calmese (Wake Forest Demon Deacons), redshirt junior forward LeJuan Watts (Texas Tech Red Raiders). and sophomore guard Isiah Watts (Maryland Terrapins). Even with forward Cedric Coward, who now plays for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nThis season’s group has had its downs. That included a rough experience at the Maui Invitational (only beat the host Chaminade Silverswords), followed by three straight losses at the Bradley Braves, vs. the Nevada Wolfpack, and the USC Trojans.\n\nHeading over to West Coast Conference play, the Cougars have a rough stretch of back-to-back-to-back competition. They lost at home to the Saint Mary’s Gaels (88-82) this past Saturday, Jan. 10, have the upcoming bout with the No. 9 Gonzaga Bulldogs (17-1, 5-0 WCC), and then head down to the Bay Area to take on the San Francisco Dons on Saturday, Jan. 18.\n\nWashington State junior forward Rihards Vavers knows a thing or two about a crazy travel schedule, as he hails from Adazi, Latvia. The Slipper Still Fits chatted with him before the matchup with the Zags and asked him who some of his favorite Latvian basketball inspirations.\n\n“The obvious one would be Kristaps Porzingis. I grew up watching him. The Bertans brothers. Arthur Jagas, he’s a point guard playing in the EuroLeague. There’s a lot of good people now coming out of Latvia. It’s been cool to see everybody grow and expand their game.”\n\nStarting out his collegiate career with the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference’s Quinnipiac Bobcats in Hamden, Connecticut, Vavers has always been a top-shelf shooter, shooting 39.5 percent from beyond the arc through his 57 career games played.\n\nLast season with the Cougars, Vavers didn’t get to show all that he’s capable of, as he was dealing with injuries. He only played 17 games in 2024-25 as he had suffered broken bones in both hands.\n\nIn 2025-26, the 6-7, 210-pound product is scoring 9.4 points per game on a shooting split of 42.5 field goal percentage/37.8 three-point percentage/82.4 free throw percentage to go along with 3.2 rebounds per game. Vavers has started five of the 17 games that he’s played this season.\n\nSince coming to Pullman, coach David Riley’s coaching style has helped open up Vavers’ game.\n\n“He just see the confidence in me. He just sees how great of a shooter I am and my teammates do as well. They find me, they believe in me. Once I got my team behind my back, I just come out every night and attack the basket, read the game. Riley’s confidence and all the coaching staff’s confidence in me has really been helping me.”\n\nOne teammate that Vavers has all the confidence in the world is true freshman Ace Glass. The skilled guard has made an immediate impact in Washington State’s backcourt, averaging a team-leading 15.9 points on a shooting split of 47.5 field goal percentage/35.6 three-point percentage/87.5 free throw percentage.\n\n“It’s crazy that he’s a freshman. He’s learning every day. He still asks a lot of questions. Even though he’s one of our best players, he’s still curious about every single thing going on the court. He’s just trying to get that experience… He sees the game differently. He’s a scorer. He’s learning how to play defense… It’s just been amazing to see him grow ever since we got here, since the summer and up until now… I’m so happy for him. And he has so much potential.”\n\nThe first meeting between the Zags and the Cougars dates all the way back to 1907. Washington State leads the all-time series over Gonzaga, 98-54. Although the Zags have won the last seven meetings.\n\nVavers is aware of how much this Eastern Washington rivalry being back means to the state, and as the two programs transition into the revamped Pac-12 Conference.\n\n“It’s great playing guys like from Gonzaga and just getting after it. We get like two – maybe three opportunities, including the tournament, to play against them. So going up against the best of the best to challenge you and just to see what you’ve been working on all year. It’s just a great matchup to play against a top ten team. I feel like we’ve been preparing and growing up ever since the season started.”\n\nThe Beasley Coliseum in the Palouse fits over 12,000 fans. The arena will bring together some of the finest college basketball fans from all over the surrounding area, and Vavers is expecting a deafening environment.\n\n“Students are finally back on campus. Last year was crazy. Hope this year is going to be amazing too. It’s going to be a good game and can’t wait to see everybody out there.”\n\nThe matchup between the two programs tips off on Thursday, Jan. 15, at 7:00 p.m. PT on the CBS Sports Network.\n\nGet off to an early start, close even stronger\n\nThis has been a continuous issue for Gonzaga when it comes to high energy from the get-go, recently against the Seattle U RedHawks and Santa Clara Broncos at the McCarthey Athletic Center. The same goes for giving up a large lead and slacking off in the second half at the Jenny Craig Pavilion against the San Diego Toreros.\n\nPlay competitive basketball for a full 40 minutes.\n\nDefend the ball screen, jump into passing lanes\n\nAmongst the rest of the West Coast Conference programs, the Cougars struggle with taking care of and sharing the ball. Washington State ranks No. 11 with 13.5 turnovers per game and last at No. 12 with 12.4 assists per game.\n\nThe struggles at the charity stripe, as of late, continue for coach Mark Few’s unit. The Zags rank No. 9 out of 12 teams in the West Coast Conference in that category at 70.0 percent.\n\nAccording to FanDuel Sportsbook, Gonzaga is the favorite over Washington State by a massive 17.5 points. Moneyline for the Zags is at -2800, +1160 for the Cougars. The over/under is set at 157.5.\n\nGonzaga is currently riding a ten-game winning streak and is on the No. 2/No. 3 seed line for the NCAA Tournament.\n\nArden Cravalho is a Gonzaga University graduate from the Bay Area… Follow him on X @a_cravalho",

We got Seattle man!\"\n\nKendricks followed up, saying, \"We got to beat them, let's pump our brakes,\" before closing his statement with, \"This is what meaningful football is all about.\"\n\nAside from the reality of having fewer snaps when the All-Pro comes back, Kendricks makes a great point, because if the Niners are not able to win over Seattle on Saturday, their season will be over, and they won't see Warner return until next season.\n\nUnsurprisingly, San Francisco is heading into the game as the underdog, but that doesn't mean much to them, considering they have been the underdog for most of the season, especially with the injuries on defense. Still, if they pull off the upset one more time, their All-Pro captain will be waiting on them.\n\nDianna Russini’s new details on George Kittle's 49ers tequila bottle in locker room\n\n49ers vs. Eagles final score, results: San Francisco advances behind Christian McCaffrey's two touchdowns\n\nGeorge Kittle injury history: A timeline of 49ers TE's missed games, from 2020 foot fracture to latest torn Achilles injury\n\n49ers' Jauan Jennings was a higher-ranked QB recruit than Joe Burrow, Lamar Jackson and Sam Darnold\n\nWho do the 49ers play next?

    "fullText": "Following John Cena's final match of his career last month at Saturday Night's Main Event, and AJ Styles' being open about his own retirement to come in 2026, which he confirmed at Crown Jewel, other veteran wrestlers within the industry have been asked when they plan on hanging up their boots. World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk, who helped send Cena off alongside Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes, has said he's \"not going anywhere anytime soon,\" but recently clarified to CinemaBlend when he does plan on finishing up in the ring.\n\n\"When I was 15, if you asked me if I'd be wrestling when I was 40, I would tell you, 'No, that's crazy. 40 is so old,'\" Punk told the outlet. \"I'm 47, and I don't feel old yet. Terry Funk wrestled for a long time, Ric Flair wrestled for a long time. I mean, there's luchadors that are like in their 70s that are still doing it. Do I want to be doing that? Probably not. I would estimate probably the big 50 is when I should maybe gracefully bow out. Knock on wood, if nothing else horrible happens.\"\n\nSince his return from the injury at SummerSlam that August, Punk has remained healthy throughout feuds with Drew McIntyre and Seth Rollins, as well as for numerous big matches. He captured the then-vacant World Heavyweight title at Saturday Night's Main Event in November.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

Having my jersey retired is an honor I never imagined, and I'm forever grateful to Rick and Gabe as well as the entire organization.

A 3-point sharpshooter, Curry was a key part of some of the best Hornets teams including three 50-plus win campaigns and four playoff appearances. Curry remains the team's all-time leader in games played (701), and is second in points (9,839), field goals made (3,951) and 3-point field goals (929).\n\nFor a younger generation of Hornets fans, he has always been the color analyst on the broadcasts.\n\nThe jersey retirement will happen during a halftime ceremony on March 19, when Charlotte hosts Orlando.",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (13-4, 3-1 SEC) lost its first SEC game of the year on the road vs. No. 24 Tennessee, falling to the Vols in double overtime 87-82 in a game where the Aggies led until the final five minutes. Due to Tennessee's size advantage, which has been the case throughout SEC play, Texas A&M was outrebounded 60-35, including 24 offensive rebounds that led to more than 20 points.\n\nFirst-year head coach Bucky McMillan has had to resort to small ball after losing transfer forward Mackenzie Mgbako for the year, whose size and shooting ability would have likely resulted in a win on Tuesday, while starting forward Rashaun Agee, who is listed at 6'7\", but likely shorter, leads the Aggies in rebounding with 8.6 per game.\n\nStill, this is the hand McMillan has been dealt, and his team continues to play with a ton of heart and physicality, and should be 16-1 if it weren't for late-game issues against UCF, SMU, and the final seconds against Tennessee.\n\nHowever, the Aggies should have gotten the ball back with just under ten seconds remaining in regulation after senior guard Rylan Griffin's near rebound was hit out of bounds by a Tennessee player, but the refs apparently did not see enough evidence to overturn the call. Either way, missed free throws, finishing 21-32 from the stripe, ultimately cost the Aggies in the end.\n\nTexas A&M is ahead of schedule in Year 1 of McMillan's tenure in College Station, and while Tuesday's loss was frustrating for the fan base, ESPN bracketology expert Joe Lunardi was seemingly impressed with the Aggies' performance in one of the toughest environments the SEC has to offer, placing McMillan's veteran squad as one of the Last Four Byes alonside Kentucky, USC, and Wisconsin.\n\nStill, Texas A&M needs to pick up more Quad 1 wins to have any shot of making the NCAA Tournament, with another opportunity on Saturday night against rival Texas in Austin.\n\n— Joe Lunardi (@ESPNLunardi) January 14, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M rises in ESPN's Bracketology despite losing to Tennessee",

It’s the worst start to the conference slate since 2022, when Bruce Weber’s squad, in his last season in Manhattan, opened Big 12 play at 0-4. Matching that is certainly in the cards for the TangCats.\n\nThey’ll attempt to prevent that tonight against UCF, who is off to a 13-2 start to the season, and sit at 2-1 in Big 12 play after beating KU and Cincinnati in Orlando, but falling hard against Oklahoma State in Stillwater last week. That loss to the Pokes came on just their second trip outside the state of Florida in the regular season, putting the Knights at 1-1 in true road games.\n\nDespite the struggles of K-State this season, they have been usually decent at home, which hopefully will give them a leg up against the visitors who are still receiving votes on the back of beating KU. But it’s still very possible that an Actually Good UCF team comes to Bramlage and leaves the Sunflower State with yet another win this season.\n\nOn a positive note, it’s going to be a lightly-watched affair, as this game is being streamed on Peacock and NBC Sports Now, so no cable/YouTubeTV options for this one.\n\nWe’ve got an 7:02pm CT tipoff from Bramlage Coliseum, and you can catch the action streaming on Peacock with Pete Sousa (play-by-play) and Brendan Haywood (analyst) on the call.\n\nIf you don’t have Peacock, the game can be heard across portions of the 28-station K-State Sports Network with Wyatt Thompson (play-by-play) and Stan Weber (analyst) calling the action.

    "fullText": "Wild-card weekend ended with a close game that quickly got out of hand in the fourth quarter. The 30-6 outcome didn't impact viewership.\n\nESPN has announced that 29.1 million viewers, on average, watched the multi-network Texans-Steelers simulcast on ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, and Deportes. It's a 15-percent increase over last year's lopsided wild-card game between the Vikings and Rams.\n\nThe audience peaked between 9:00 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. ET, at 33 million.\n\nThe Texans led the game, 7-6, entering the fourth quarter. The dam broke in the final 15 minutes.\n\nThe total number matched the January 2024 Monday night wild-card game between the Eagles and Buccaneers.\n\nESPN didn't, and usually doesn't, announce the viewership for the ManningCast, which has struggled to siphon eyeballs from the main broadcast in the years since ESPN broke the bank to hire Joe Buck and Troy Aikman from Fox. And for good reason; people who want to watch the game are far more inclined to, you know, watch the game — not a live podcast that often treats the game as background noise.",

    "fullText": "Broncos' key defensive starter likely won't return this season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos have been as healthy as any team in the NFL this season, but heading into the divisional round of the playoffs against the Buffalo Bills, it appears that one of their defensive starters won't play again this season.\n\nIn his second season with the Broncos, Jones suffered a pectoral injury in Week 15 against the Green Bay Packers. He was placed on injured reserve, but there was hope at the time that he might be able to return for the playoffs.\n\nBroncos 9News insider Mike Klis reported that Jones, who has undergone surgery for a torn pectoral muscle, could be back for the Super Bowl if the Broncos get to Santa Clara. However, Broncos head coach Sean Payton sounded much less enthusiastic about that. When asked directly if Jones could be back at some point this season, Payton simply said, \"I don't think so\".\n\nSean Payton was asked by @ParkerJGabriel if he thinks Brandon Jones will play again this year.\n\n“I don’t think so.” pic.twitter.com/4esKqOzqA1\n\n— Luca Evans (@bylucaevans) January 13, 2026\n\nThat seems like the most likely scenario, as unfortunate as that is. A torn pectoral is not something that you can return quickly from, so Jones will likely be shut down for the season at this point, cheering his team on from the sidelines. In his place, P.J. Locke has been placed back into the starting lineup.\n\nLocke has started each of the team's last three games and has 16 tackles and three pass breakups on the season. He left the team's Week 18 game against the Los Angeles Chargers with a leg injury, but has been a full participant in practice this week. Devon Key and JL Skinner are the other safeties on the 53-man roster.\n\nREAD:Broncos' Pro Bowler given more reason to be named first-ever winner of new award\n\nIt's tough to lose Jones, who has been great for the team. He and Talanoa Hufanga made up one of the better safety combinations in the league this season. In his two seasons with the Broncos, Jones has recorded 193 tackles, four interceptions, 17 pass deflections and one fumble recovery. He will be entering the final year of his three-year deal next season.\n\nBroncos seen as potential suitor for former first-round running back\n\nBroncos could have serious advantage in divisional playoff as Bills are hurting at major spot\n\nBroncos will have a silver lining if they close as underdogs against Bills\n\nDenver Broncos Playoff Notes: Postseason record vs. Buffalo Bills, divisional record and more\n\nBo Nix, Broncos get perfect chance to back up great recent quote",

    "fullText": "RED BULL ARENA, LEIPZIG (Bulinews): RB Leipzig coach Ole Werner praised his team's defensive solidity after Wednesday's 2-0 Bundesliga win over Freiburg at Red Bull Arena.\n\nMuch to Werner's delight, Leipzig limited Freiburg to just three shots in total, with only one on target.\n\n“The foundation for the victory was that we defended very well. Looking at the stats, we allowed almost nothing and were extremely solid defensively on set pieces,” Werner told Bulinews.com and the rest of the accredited media at his post-match press conference.\n\nThe Leipzig boss was also pleased to see his team score twice from set pieces.\n\n“Scoring from set pieces is great because it’s important to be able to create dangerous situations even when the opponent sits deep,” he added.\n\nFreiburg coach Julian Schuster was pleased with his team’s defensive display in the first half but disappointed with their attacking output and how the game unfolded after the break, when Leipzig scored both goals.\n\n“We had good ball recoveries where the opportunity was definitely there to become more dangerous, but we didn’t take advantage of them. When the spaces were available, we didn’t use them well enough. We simply didn’t offer enough attacking threat,” said Schuster.\n\n\"On the positive side, we allowed very few chances, especially in the first half. Naturally, it’s a shame that we conceded through two set-piece goals. When the opponent can bring on players like (Yan) Diomande and (Antonio) Nusa, it doesn’t make the situation any easier,\" he added.",

    "description": "He found it driving a car out of his own shop for the first time ever",
    "fullText": "During load-in day over the weekend, Christopher Bell took some time to just reminisce in his hauler with Keith Kunz Motorsports co-owner Pete Willoughby because so much of his path to the Cup Series runs through this building.\n\n“We just sat down and talked about how this building basically launched my career,” Bell told Motorsport.com on Wednesday morning. “He hired me to run his car for the first time at the Chili Bowl in 2013 and I was just expecting a one-race deal.\n\n“I was supposed to go Sprint Car racing with Rick Ferkel but one day before my prelim race that night, he took me into the grandstands in 3 and 4 and said they wanted me to race full-time for them.\n\n“Like, this was before I even hot lapped, so Pete and I were just reminiscing how this conversation in 2013, in this building, forever changed the forecast of what my career was going to be.”\n\nBell went on to win six races en route to the USAC National Midget Series championship that year. He added seven more wins the next year in a runner-up finish to teammate Rico Abreu.\n\nBut again, every pivotal moment in his life and career runs through this building, and it is not lost on him when he returns to race each year.  With that said, this year is different because he is not racing for Pete and Keith.\n\nHe’s not racing for Chad Boat either.\n\nThis year, Christopher Bell is racing for Christopher Bell, a team comprised of his friends, including teammate Kaidon Brown. He won the Invitational Race of Champions on Monday and it was obvious that his first win as an owner-driver was special.\n\n“Well, whenever you show up as a driver here, at first, it’s about proving you belong and there’s no better way to do that than with a team like Keith and Chad,” Bell said. “You know their cars are going to be good and they have that proven notebook.\n\n“They run so many cars and have so much track time that they can try a lot of different things each time one of their cars hit the track. So that’s why their teams make sense for a young driver and why it made sense for me to race there too.\n\n“But I already accomplished that. I have won races for the best teams and with the best crew chiefs and I wanted a challenge. I wanted to race with my friends and have my own space in the pit area.”\n\nBell said his first call was to Brown, and that he didn’t even plan to drive the second car, until everyone on his short list told him that they had other deals locked down for 2026. So he jumped in his No. 21 instead.\n\n“But overall, winning as a driver here doesn’t give me the same high because I had been there and done that and the highs are not as high,” Bell said. “So to win Race of Champions, with my own stuff, that was a high I hadn’t had before.\n\n“If we can win with Kaidon, that would mean way more to me than even winning Race of Champions. I just enjoy being here with my friends more than the racing at this stage.”\n\nWith that said, he is here as a driver too, and he absolutely wants to get to four wins but for the same intellectual reasons he listed before.\n\n“It would mean a lot but it’s so much more about the team aspect than the driving aspect,” Bell said. “Winning number four as a driver, it just doesn’t do it for me. I would obviously love that, but like last year, I came here with Keith and Pete, and I just didn’t feel the same burning desire.\n\n“It’s just different now. Hopefully we get the opportunity on Saturday and I think it’s going to be a different feeling than the one I felt last year because there’s a different level of investment in building the cars and doing it all on my own if that makes sense.”\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "The Celtic manager Martin O'Neill says \"cut me a little bit of slack\" as the club work on bringing in new faces this month.",
    "fullText": "Celtic manager Martin O'Neill is calling for patience as the club tries to bring in \"necessary\" signings in their bid to chase down Hearts and defend their Scottish Premiership title.\n\nO'Neill kept up his 100% domestic record as Celtic boss this season with a 1-0 win away at Falkirk to stay six points behind the league leaders.\n\nHowever, the insipid nature of the performance - which yielded just two shots on target - will only increase demand from fans to strengthen the squad.\n\nFormer Celtic striker Chris Sutton described the display as \"lacklustre\" and asked \"where has the recruitment plan gone?\"\n\n\"We're making progress on things and certainly by the end of the window we should have some players to supplement this squad,\" O'Neill told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"I thought my time was done here, so I wasn't expecting to pick up the pieces again and look at players. Just give us a little bit of time, cut me a little bit of slack and we'll be OK.\n\n\"The focus is to try and win some football matches, but the other aspect to it is to add a bit of extra quality to help the players out here.\"\n\nNygren goal sinks Falkirk & edges Celtic into second\n\nLatest Celtic news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app\n\nMuch of the discussion about Celtic has centred around the need for a striker, or perhaps two.\n\nBenjamin Nygren scored the winner against Falkirk and, in doing so, became the first Celtic player to reach 10 goals in the league this season.\n\nThat is despite the fact the Sweden international has not played as a striker, but in midfield or as a winger. And he has only started 14 of their 22 league games.\n\nCeltic are underperforming their expected goals by 10 this season, have only the fourth best conversion rate and rank second bottom for shooting accuracy.\n\nThe champions have scored 39 goals from 22 games - after the same number of matches last season they had netted 61 times.\n\nThe stats on their productivity in front of goal are damning.\n\nLast season's top scorer Daizen Maeda, who has seven Premiership goals this term, did score most of his 33 goals last season from the left wing.\n\nHowever, former Celtic midfielder John Collins believes an experienced striker could change everything.\n\n\"It's hard playing football without a natural centre forward,\" he said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound. \"Someone you can hit and you know it'll stick.\n\n\"If you're a midfielder you can play one-twos, knowing they can bounce it off you. You can't do that with Maeda, he likes to run in behind. You can't link with him.\n\n\"He's up there doing his best, but he's not a real centre forward for me. A good centre forward can change everything.\n\n\"You're getting half chances, next thing you're 3-0 up. The chances Celtic do create, if you've got a good striker you're winning comfortably.\"\n\nRight-back Julian Araujo has arrived on loan from Bournemouth this month, as Celtic also look to address weaknesses in other areas, amid injuries to some key players too.\n\nBecuase while profligacy has been costly at times this season - especially in the ill-fated Wilfried Nancy eta - it was not their major problem against Falkirk.\n\nThey only managed two shots on target and were outplayed in spells by John McGlynn's side, who hassled in midfield and worked incredibly hard.\n\nAs a result, the hosts created the better chances and played some slick football.\n\nCallum McGregor was isolated on the ball in midfield, despite Nygren and Arne Engels starting alongside him.\n\nCollins believes the team also needs another athletic midfielder and a winger too.\n\n\"Engels has good games and very average games. Nygren comes in and out of games, and lacks consistency,\" the former Celtic assistant said.\n\n\"One player who always wants the ball is Callum McGregor. Week in, week out he's at a level. They've got to get more quality in the central area.\"\n\nCeltic's next league game is a critical one away to Hearts, a match that will help define the destiny of the title.\n\nIf there are no new faces ready to go by then fans will be furious, never mind the much-loved O'Neill's call for patience.\n\nPeter: We were outplayed by a team that were in Championship last season. We need several new players. If O'Neill does not get them he should do what Brendan Rodgers did and walk away.\n\nJohn: Poor performance. Continually we are told we need signings yet , as with windows recently, we watch for signings every day and so far we have one loan deal. Exasperating when we have a pile of money in the bank.\n\nAlfie: Much much better but Martin knows we need quality players. Still not a solid team.\n\nDavy: I cant believe how bad this Celtic team are. A very painful watch as a fan.",

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid will be busy over the coming weeks, as they seek to add to Diego Simeone’s squad during the winter transfer window. They need replacements for Conor Gallagher, who has joined Tottenham Hotspur in a deal worth €40m, and Giacomo Raspadori, who is about to leave for Atalanta, and targets have already been identified.\n\nGallagher’s departure has left Atleti with Pablo Barrios, Koke Resurreccion, Johnny Cardoso and Marcos Llorente as central midfield options, but with the latter preferred as a right-back, it is clear that a new addition is needed. The money will be there for director of football Mateu Alemany to spend, and some of it could be spent on Joao Gomes.\n\nAs per Marca, Atleti are interested in Gomes, who is also wanted by Manchester United and Napoli. The 24-year-old, who has featured 10 times for Brazil, is expected to leave Wolves in 2026, given that relegation from the Premier League is seen as an absolutely certainty to happen.\n\nA sale this month would allow Wolves to bring in a bigger transfer fee for Gomes, especially given the strong interest being shown in his services. This wouldn’t be overly ideal for Atleti, who would prefer not to get into a bidding war for one of their leading targets.\n\nThe impending departure of Raspadori means that Atleti will need a new attacker, but midfield is the absolute priority right now. The plan is for a deal to be done as soon as possible, which is why numerous targets are being looked at – with one of them being Gomes.\n\nIt will be interesting to see who Atleti end up going for. They have many options at their disposal, but finding the right one to compete with Barrios, Koke and Cardoso will be crucial.",

Clearly James can relate to that feeling at this point in his career.\n\nDespite his sustained greatness, both on and off the court, James has an ocean of detractors who would rather nitpick ways that he isn’t as good as one legend or another, as opposed to simply appreciating his unique, once-in-a-lifetime greatness.\n\nIt remains to be seen if James will retire after the current campaign, or if he’ll stick around for another year or two. But either way, that day is coming, and when it does, the basketball world will absolutely miss James.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO — Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman spoke with reporters Wednesday for the first time since the Irish were left out of the College Football Playoff.\n\nHe touched on multiple topics, including addressing some big additions through the transfer portal. Here are six things Freeman said:\n\nThe “Here Come the Irish” docuseries on Peacock recently showed the moment the Irish coaches and players found out that Alabama and Miami made the CFP over them.\n\nFreeman stared at the video screen with his mouth open. Players put their faces in their hands.\n\nFreeman said Wednesday that he thought the series properly captured the disappointment and confusion they felt. A month later, he said there’s still disappointment for the Irish, who had been ranked No. 9 or 10 up until the selection show. Miami, which will play Indiana in the national championship Monday, received the last spot in the 12-team CFP.\n\n“But you have to move forward, and that’s what we’ve done as a program,” Freeman said. “That’s what I’ve done as a leader. As I reminded the group in our team meeting on Sunday, it’s our responsibility to make sure we leave no doubt. We can’t blame it on somebody else. Although I may be confused about some of the criteria and the committee’s rankings and all those different things, it’s our job as we move forward to make sure we leave no doubt.”\n\nFreeman said he hasn’t second-guessed his team’s decision to skip a bowl game after being left out of the CFP. He said he was proud of how the captains made the decision and didn’t believe it was an emotional one.\n\nHe asked them again and again if they were sure about the decision.\n\n“Because I didn’t want them to regret it,” Freeman said. “And they were convicted in their decision, and I fully support them.”\n\nFreeman’s name has popped up a few times in this NFL hiring cycle. But he announced he was staying at Notre Dame on Dec. 29, when he posted on social media: “2026…run it back”\n\nFreeman noted that he always tells his players that the future is uncertain.\n\n“But everything I want and everything that I need personally can be achieved right here as a head coach of this program,” he said. “And so I hope this is something we have to address every year. I really do because it means we’re having a lot of success right here at Notre Dame.”\n\nFreeman said he has used discussions with NFL teams to gather information and learn how he can be a better coach. He said he didn’t know if an NFL job would interest him at some point in the future.\n\n“I don’t know enough about it,” he said.” Maybe sometime in the future, if it’s the right time and it’s what I think is right for me, then maybe I’ll pursue it. But I don’t love wasting time thinking about things that aren’t right in front of me, and so I don’t know what I will want in however much length of time from now. I know right now that I am as convicted and motivated to be the best head coach of the Notre Dame football program as I can be.”\n\nLast month, Notre Dame and USC put their 96-game rivalry series on pause because they couldn’t agree to the timing of the 2026 game. The Irish then scheduled BYU for a home-and-home series instead.\n\nFreeman said he believes the rivalry is “important for college football” and the athletic department leaders will work to get it back at some point. But he said the proposed timing wasn’t best for Notre Dame and its 2026 CFP pursuit.\n\n“I’m a competitive individual, right?” Freeman said. “And I want to go play anytime, anywhere, but at the same token, it’s important that I make decisions too that are best for the program. And to move a game that we were pretty sure was going to be Week 12 to Week 0 isn’t what’s best for our program. And they had to make decisions that were best for their program. I don’t blame them. They had to make decisions. We had to make decisions.”\n\nFreeman believes his family’s name was “dragged through the mud unnecessarily” over a recent interaction at a high school wrestling tournament.\n\nAn assistant high school wrestling coach, identified by the South Bend Tribune as Chris Fleeger, accused Freeman of battery at the event, saying Freeman pushed him with two hands. But the St. Joseph County prosecutor’s office said it determined through video evidence and interviews that no criminal battery occurred, and Freeman won’t be charged.\n\n“I was confident in this outcome because I know I did not intentionally touch anyone in a rude, angry or disrespectful way,” Freeman said. “I’m glad this matter has been thoroughly reviewed and resolved.”\n\nFreeman took issue of the initial reporting of the incident by the South Bend Tribune before all of the evidence was released.\n\nNotre Dame said in a statement Sunday that the wrestling coach verbally accosted Freeman’s son, Vinny, a senior who signed to wrestle at Cornell, and Freeman and his wife tried to remove their son from the situation.\n\n“I know I’m a public figure, and I understand the scrutiny that comes with that,” Freeman said. “That scrutiny should not extend to my children or any other child of a public figure.”\n\nThe Irish recently announced the additions of former Ohio State wide receivers Quincy Porter and Mylan Graham.\n\nPorter was the nation’s fifth-ranked wide receiver and the No. 1 player from New Jersey in the 2025 class. He had four catches for 59 yards in four games as an Ohio State freshman after missing some time with an injury.\n\nGraham, who was a five-star prospect and the nation’s fifth-ranked receiver in 2024, had six catches for 93 yards in 2025.\n\n“We knew a lot about them in the high school recruiting process, who they were, the type of players they are,” Freeman said. “And I’m glad we were able to get them.”\n\nNotre Dame also landed in the portal former Alabama edge rusher Keon Keeley, who was a five-star recruit ranked No. 2 in the 247Sports composite rankings in 2023. Keeley originally had committed to Notre Dame out of high school before flipping to Alabama.\n\nFreeman called it “a little delayed gratification.”\n\n“I’ve always believed Keon was a Notre Dame kid coming from his high school,” he said. “He’s such a unique individual. He’s a very talented football player. … When he came on his visit, I’m like, ‘Yep, it’s the same Keon we recruited a couple years ago.’ And he fits here, and I’m excited for his future.”\n\nFreeman said linebacker Drayk Bowen had surgery on the labrum in his hip, but he expects him to return in some capacity this spring.\n\nThe Irish expect linebacker Kyngstonn Viliamu-Asa to be back to full-go around the start of the 2026 season. He is recovering from an ACL injury.",

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers may get a significant lift for their defense a week earlier than they anticipated.\n\nLinebacker Fred Warner had his practice window opened Tuesday in a move designed to get him on the field for walk throughs during the week according to head coach Kyle Shanahan. All reporting as Warner neared a return indicated the 49ers would have to reach the NFC championship to get their All-Pro linebacker back. Shanahan indicated as much after Week 18.\n\nWhile speaking with reporters in the locker room ahead of Wednesday's practice, Warner didn't rule out playing Saturday night in Seattle.\n\n\"We're taking it day by day,\" Warner said via ESPN's Nick Wagoner. \"I think they said last week they weren't going to open my window and then my window is now open. So yeah, we're just taking it day by day.\"\n\nWarner backed his words up by practicing an awful lot like a player readying himself to suit up in a few days. Here's a video of Warner from Wednesday's session:\n\n#49ers LB Fred Warner going through individual drills and a quick self evaluation at the end… (sound on)… pic.twitter.com/wPtPGBgvMQ\n\n— Nick Wagoner (@nwagoner) January 14, 2026\n\nThe 49ers may not want to take chances with their superstar defender. They could play it safe and continue holding off his return until the NFC championship game if they make it that far.\n\nOn the other hand, if Warner is ready to play and can help the 49ers ailing defense get to the NFC championship, it's hard to imagine they hold him out another week.\n\nWarner has been a limited participant in the first two practices of the divisional round. Thursday is the final practice of the week, after which we'll get a status report for Warner and the rest of the club. The ultimate tell will be whether his activation off IR is among the club's pre-game roster moves.\n\nMore 49ers: 49ers add more depth to their TE room after George Kittle's injury\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: Fred Warner update: 49ers LB won't rule out return vs. Seahawks",

    "fullText": "Hosts Morocco will play Sadio Mane's Senegal in this weekend's Africa Cup of Nations final after both emerged victorious in tense last-four ties on Wednesday as Mohamed Salah's dreams of winning the title were again dashed.\n\nMorocco beat Nigeria 4-2 on penalties after their semi-final showdown of few chances in capital Rabat finished 0-0 at the end of extra time, with goalkeeper Yassine Bounou performing heroics by saving twice in the shoot-out.\n\nBounou, of Saudi side Al-Hilal, saved from Samuel Chukwueze and Bruno Onyemaechi, allowing Youssef En-Nesyri to convert the winning kick and spark wild celebrations among over 65,000 fans inside the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium.\n\nAs well as joy there was relief for Hamza Igamane, who had appeared distraught after his kick -- Morocco's second in the shoot-out -- was saved by Nigeria goalkeeper Stanley Nwabali.\n\nHe was the only Moroccan player to fail to score in the shoot-out, however, with captain and talisman Achraf Hakimi among those who converted their penalties.\n\n\"It was one of the hardest matches we have had against a very solid and talented team,\" said Morocco coach Walid Regragui, who played in the last Atlas Lions team to reach the AFCON final when they lost to Tunisia in 2004.\n\n\"I am very happy for the players and for the Moroccan people who really deserve this.\n\n\"It is a great gift for them to be in the final but we will need to recover quickly because we put a lot of energy into the game.\"\n\nThe shoot-out came after a cagey encounter, with almost all the chances of note coming in the first half and Nigeria mustering just two shots in the entire game.\n\nMorocco have been under enormous pressure to deliver a first AFCON title for their country in half a century and just their second overall.\n\nHowever, as their dream remains alive it is an agonising way for Nigeria's hopes to end, two years after they lost the final to the hosts in Ivory Coast.\n\nLed by two recent winners of the African player of the year prize in Victor Osimhen and Ademola Lookman, Nigeria had been arguably the best team at the tournament up to the semi-finals and the top scorers with 14 goals in their first five matches.\n\n\"The players fought for every ball and it is difficult to lose on penalties, but this is football and we have to accept it,\" said Nigeria coach Eric Chelle.\n\nHe added: \"I am proud of my players but I am disappointed for them because the reality is we were maybe the best team that there has been in this AFCON.\"\n\nEarlier, Mane scored a 78th-minute winner to give Senegal a 1-0 victory over Egypt in Tangiers, then said he was playing in the tournament for the last time.\n\n\"I'm very happy to be able to play in my very last AFCON. I hope to win it (the final) and bring (the trophy) back to Dakar,\" the 33-year-old said.\n\nSenegal, champions in 2022, dominated possession against cautious Egypt as the Cup of Nations title continues to elude Liverpool superstar Salah.\n\nThis was Salah's fifth AFCON and the closest he has come to a winners' medal is finishing a runner-up twice.\n\nIt will be Senegal's fourth Cup of Nations final appearance overall and their third in the last four editions.\n\n\"I think we managed the game well from start to finish and, overall, we deserved to win. We'll try to be ready for the final, above all to give our best,\" said Mane.\n\n\"The most important thing for me is that Senegal wins every time... I am a soldier of the nation. I try to give my all every day, whether in training or in matches.\n\n\"The Africa Cup of Nations is the most difficult competition in the world. All the teams are evenly matched.\"\n\nReferring to his former Liverpool teammate Salah, Mane said the Egyptian is \"one of the best players in the world\".\n\nThe goal that decided the game came with 12 minutes remaining, as Mane's low shot flew past the goalkeeper and into the net.",

    "fullText": "On a day when the Oregon Ducks' program received positive news of starting quarterback Dante Moore's decision to forego the 2026 NFL draft and return to Eugene for one more season, they're also set to lose their lone quarterback commit in the 2026 recruiting class.\n\nBryson Beaver, who announced his commitment on June 25 and signed with the Ducks on December 3, plans to enter the transfer portal, per On3's Chris Low.\n\nBeaver had originally been committed to the Boise State Broncos before decommitting after a 2025 summer in which he rose up the rankings after a strong showing at multiple camps. He rose all the way to being rated as a four-star and coming in as the No. 12 quarterback and No. 174 player overall, per 247 Sports Composite.\n\nAfter garnering interest from multiple SEC schools after his decommitment, he ultimately decided to commit, and eventually sign, with Oregon.\n\nNow, those plans appear to have changed.\n\nBREAKING: Oregon QB Bryson Beaver plans to enter the NCAA Transfer Portal as a short-term signee, @Clowfb reports. \n\nBeaver was one of the fastest-rising recruits in the 2026 @Rivals player rankings📈https://t.co/e1rIFOpAc3 pic.twitter.com/u13GxbIWOu\n\nThe quarterback room for the Ducks has changed since Beaver's signing, as reserves Austin Novosad and Luka Moga entered the transfer portal. Former Nebraska Cornhuskers two-year starter Dylan Raiola, a former five-star in the 2024 class, transferred in and will spend the year as Moore's backup barring injury.\n\nNotably, 2025 backup Brock Thomas and Akili Smith Jr., a four-star in the 2025 class, are still with the program and expected to be back next season.\n\nIn the short term, Oregon is set at the quarterback position. And they may very well be set on a long-term basis as well, as Raiola is expected to redshirt and have two seasons of eligibility remaining when he'll presumably to take the field as the starter in 2027.\n\nDespite that, not having a single quarterback recruit in a single class can't be seen as a positive for the Ducks.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: Oregon Ducks 2026 signee Bryson Beaver to enter transfer portal",

They starred at Pitt and Nebraska, respectively, before enjoying prolific NFL careers.\n\nHere's the complete list of 18 players and four coaches headed to the Hall in Atlanta.\n\nRB Jerry Azumah – University of New Hampshire (1995-98)\n\nRB Ki-Jana Carter – Penn State (1991-94)\n\nOT Bruce Collie – University of Texas at Arlington (1981-84)\n\nLB George Cumby – Oklahoma (1976-79)\n\nDT Aaron Donald – Pittsburgh (2010-13)\n\nWR/KR Marvin Harrison – Syracuse (1992-95)\n\nRB Garrison Hearst – Georgia (1990-92)\n\nDB Chris Hudson – Colorado (1991-94)\n\nRB Mark Ingram – Alabama (2008-10)\n\nC Olin Kreutz – Washington (1995-97)\n\nLB James Laurinaitis – Ohio State (2005-08)\n\nQB Jordan Lynch – Northern Illinois (2010-13)\n\nWR Herman Moore – Virginia (1988-90)\n\nCB Terence Newman – Kansas State (1999-2002)\n\nOG Bob Novogratz– United States Military Academy (1957-58)\n\nDT Ndamukong Suh – Nebraska (2006-09)\n\nWR Peter Warrick – Florida State (1996-99)\n\nJim Margraff – Johns Hopkins (1990-2018)\n\nChris Petersen – Boise State (2006-13); Washington (2014-19)\n\nKen Sparks – Carson-Newman University (1980-2016)\n\nIngram rushed for 1,658 yards and piled up 20 total touchdowns (17 rushing and three receiving) during the 2009 season. He became the first Alabama player to win the Heisman Trophy, and the Crimson Tide won the BCS national championship. He went on to play 12 seasons in the NFL.\n\nLong before Donald was a three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year, he was ACC Defensive Player of the Year and a whole lot more. In fact, he swept the sport's major defensive awards during his final college season in 2013, when he stacked 28.5 TFLs, 11 sacks and 4 forced fumbles.\n\nSuh went on to earn All-Pro honors five times as a defensive stalwart in the NFL during the 2010s. But first, his play made him a must-watch sensation at Nebraska. In 2008, he recorded two pick 6s, and he notched a receiving touchdown while lining up as a fullback. The next season, he amassed 85 total tackles, 20.5 TFLs and 12 sacks before collecting hardware as college football's top defensive player.\n\nWarrick overlapped with FSU's dominance in the '90s. During the two-time first-team All-American receiver's four seasons with the Seminoles, they were a mainstay at the top of the national polls. He mounted 1,232 receiving yards and 13 total touchdowns in 1998 and then helped FSU win it all in 1999.\n\nHarrison is a Pro Football of Famer, too. He became a household name with the Indianapolis Colts. Before that, however, he developed at Syracuse, where he eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards and tallied two punt return touchdowns in 1995.\n\nPatterson was a TCU staple. He coached the Horned Frogs for 22 seasons, compiling a 181-79 record along the way. He guided them to 11 bowl victories — including a win in the Rose Bowl during the 2010 season another in the Peach Bowl during the 2014 season — and helped them navigate their transitions from Conference USA to the Mountain West and then to the Big 12.\n\nSimilarly, Petersen helped transform Boise State into the football power that it is today. He's the winningest-coach in the Broncos' history. From 2006-13, he went 92-12. In that span, he piloted Boise State to a pair of Fiesta Bowl victories: Those came in 2006 and 2009, each capping undefeated seasons and top-five finishes in the AP Poll. He later led Washington to three straight double-digit-win seasons from 2016-18, picking up a pair of Pac-12 titles in the process.",

    "description": "The Padres signed Nick Solak and Omar Cruz to minor league contracts, adding non-roster depth on both sides of the ball as the club continues to round out its organization ahead of Spring Training.",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO, Calif. -- The San Diego Padres have signed infielder/outfielder Nick Solak and left-handed pitcher Omar Cruz to minor league contracts, according to Baseball America’s Matt Eddy.\n\nBoth players are expected to receive invitations to major league camp, providing the organization with additional depth as spring training approaches.\n\nSolak, 31, brings prior major league experience after spending parts of four seasons with the Texas Rangers from 2019 through 2022. During that stretch, he logged 974 plate appearances and posted a .252/.327/.372 slash line, production that graded slightly below league average. While he demonstrated on-base ability, his limited power output and defensive versatility made it difficult for him to secure a long-term role at the big league level.\n\nDefensively, Solak has appeared at first base, second base, third base, and in the outfield, though advanced metrics and evaluations have generally rated him below average across those positions. As a result, his offensive contributions needed to be more impactful to offset his glove, something that never fully materialized in the majors.\n\nAt the Triple-A level, however, Solak has continued to be productive. Last season in the Pirates’ system, he delivered strong offensive numbers across 482 plate appearances, posting a .332/.411/.492 line with solid plate discipline.\n\nWhile some of that production was aided by a high batting average on balls in play, it nonetheless reinforced his reputation as a reliable minor league hitter. Solak briefly appeared in four major league games with Pittsburgh before being removed from the 40-man roster, as he no longer had minor league options remaining.\n\nA right-handed bat, Solak has historically fared better against left-handed pitching, giving him potential utility as a platoon or bench option if he forces his way into consideration. For now, he adds position-player depth without occupying a roster spot.\n\nCruz, who turns 27 later this month, returns to the organization after making his major league debut with San Diego last season. He appeared in limited action, working 3 2/3 innings and striking out five. The Padres non-tendered Cruz at the deadline, briefly sending him to free agency before bringing him back on a non-roster deal.\n\nOriginally developed as a starter, Cruz has transitioned between roles throughout his minor league career. He found success as a reliever in 2024, showing increased strikeout rates, before being stretched back out last season. His results were mixed, and he eventually returned to the bullpen at Triple-A.\n\nWhether Cruz remains in relief or is given another opportunity to start remains undecided. Either way, he provides left-handed pitching depth and remains optionable if he earns another look at the major league level.",

The Dallas job came open shortly after the end of the regular season when the Cowboys fired Matt Eberflus (yes, the former Chicago Bears’ head coach) from the job.\n\nCovington does have past experience as a DC, serving in that capacity for the New England Patriots during the 2024 season. That tenure ended when head coach Jerod Mayo was fired, and it immediately preceded his arrival in Green Bay last offseason.\n\nBecause of that experience, Covington was likely to be a candidate for the DC job in Green Bay if Jeff Hafley were to leave for a head coaching job elsewhere.

    "description": "The Viola have found a human being who has previously played winger.",
    "fullText": "After snapping up Manor Solomon and Marco Brescianini, Fiorentina’s January revolution thunders on with the news that the Viola are working on a deal for Leeds United’s Jack Harrison. Per Nicolò Schira, the 29-year-old will join on a 6-month loan with an option to make the move permanent until 2029 for €10ish million. I haven’t been able to find any salary numbers but it sounds like the player’s en route to Florence, which makes me think the deal will be done some time next week.\n\nHarrison’s had a pretty strange career: he spent time in the Manchester United academy before moving to the US aged 14, winning the Gatorade National Player of the Year in his final year of high school and playing for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons before entering the MLS draft and getting picked first overall; following a trade, he ended up with NYCFC (yes, this all sounds unhinged to any non-American). In 2017, he scored 10 goals and added 3 assists in 34 games, earning a move to Manchester City (NYCFC’s affiliate) and heading back to England.\n\nHe never turned out for City, moving on loan to Middlesbrough and then to Leeds for three straight seasons, helping them earn promotion in 2020. He made the move permanent a year later and helped Leeds stay up but couldn’t keep them afloat in 2023. He found a loan move to Everton rather than return to the hurly-burly of the Championship. He stayed with the Toffees for 2 years. When he finally returned to Leeds, he was greeted with disdain for refusing to stick around and fight for the shirt and has been a bit part player this year, making just 13 appearances, mostly off the bench, and failing to score or assist.\n\nHarrison can play on the right, which is where I’d expect him to slot in with Fiorentina, displacing or at least competing with Fabiano Parisi. He’s got good pace but is more shifty than speedy and works hard out of possession. He seems more like an archetype that doesn’t really exist in the modern game: the left-footed left midfielder in a 4-4-2 whose primary job is crossing the ball into the box rather than dribbling, passing, or pinching in.\n\nHe’s at least fairly diligent defensively but it’s a truly odd move for any number of reasons. The first is his wage: he’s the 2nd-highest earner at Leeds after Dominic Calvert-Lewin, raking in a remarkable €5.4 million. His contract at Elland Road runs until 2028 so he’s leaving a lot of money on the table unless Fiorentina pays him an enormous amount. Maybe Leeds will cover some or all of his salary, but that’s a significant line on the balance sheet.\n\nIt feels even more expensive when factoring in Harrison’s recent production. He’s got 9 goals and 11 assists over the past 3 years in the Premier League. He’s been a regular starter throughout, and while Leeds and Everton haven’t boasted impressive attacking numbers (or personnel, or tactics), it seems like a lot of money for a guy who’s 29, has no connection to Italy, earns a big salary, and has earned the ire of his current team’s supporters.\n\nI won’t pretend to have a good idea of who Jack Harrison is as a player. Maybe he’s perfectly suited to life in Serie A and will take the league by storm. For the price, he won’t be expected to rescue the club, either, so much as lend a hand to a beleaguered Viola squad, but I’ll echo every Premier League observer I’ve talked to about this one when I sum it up with the most Jason McAteer, “Why?”",

After an incredible regular season, an exciting bowl season, and a remarkable playoff, everything comes down to one final game to crown a champion.\n\nThe Miami Hurricanes and the Indiana Hoosiers will kick off at 6:30 p.m. CT at Hard Rock Stadium on January 19th, and a champion will be decided in Year 12 of the CFP and Year 2 of the expanded 12-team playoff.\n\nAfter two very different CFP semifinal games gave us our final two contenders for the national title, it’s time to put a bow on another stellar year of college football and determine who takes home the national championship for 2025.\n\nWhile our focus will be on who the Oklahoma Sooners are still gaining in the transfer portal once it closes on Friday night, we’ll be able to settle in and watch the season’s final game, before a long offseason awaits in college football.\n\nBelow is a full preview for the national championship game. We’ve also included a recap of the 2025 season in week-by-week form, a list of the college football champions at the lower levels, and a list of the FBS college football all-star games that are scheduled in the lead-up to the 2026 NFL Draft in April.\n\nSo, without further ado, the 156th season of college football comes to an end on Monday night. Here’s your preview for the national championship game.\n\nMiami has defeated Texas A&M, Ohio State and Ole Miss in succession to get to this point, after just sneaking into the CFP on selection day. Head coach Mario Cristobal and the Hurricanes have won in different ways during their playoff run, using a suffocating defense in the first two rounds, before getting a big performance from their offense in the semifinal. The ‘Canes have lost twice this season, but they’ve been rolling ever since, and they believe they have the overall talent to pull off a big upset on their home field.\n\nQuarterback Carson Beck had a huge day in the semis, and he’ll have to keep the mistakes down against an opponent that takes advantage of every miscue you make. This is a team that got here based on physicality up front and winning at the line of scrimmage, but a gigantic final test awaits them on Monday night. The U is oh-so close to being “back”, but to win the school’s first national title since 2001, they’ll have to do something no one else has been able to do this year.\n\nIndiana is the only undefeated FBS team, and they earned a bye in the first round of the playoff. Following that off week, they’ve promptly destroyed both Alabama and Oregon on their way to the title round. Head coach Curt Cignetti has turned the Hoosiers into an absolute juggernaut, and this is a veteran team that doesn’t make mistakes and executes at an extremely high level. Their offense is potent, their defense is everywhere, and they’ve taken down teams with far more overall blue-chippers on the roster with regularity.\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza is the Heisman Trophy winner, and he is unbelievably efficient in this offense. With an excellent o-line, and skill players everywhere, it’s hard to keep up with what the Hoosiers are capable of. Defensively, Indiana forces mistakes constantly, and they make good offenses look bad every week. They set their offense up with short fields and squeeze the life out of their opponents. The Hoosiers are heavily favored on Monday, but if the 2025 season has taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected, and that anything is capable of happening.\n\nNCAA Division I FCS: Montana State Bobcats 35, Illinois State Redbirds 34 (OT)\n\nNCAA Division II: Ferris State Bulldogs 42, Harding Bisons 21\n\nNCAA Division III: Wisconsin River-Falls Falcons 24, North Central Cardinals 14\n\nNAIA: Grand View Vikings 22, Kaiser Seahawks 16\n\nNJCAA Division I: Iowa Western Reivers 28, Hutchinson Blue Dragons 10\n\nNJCAA Division III: DuPage Chaparrals 36, North Dakota State College of Science Wildcats 13\n\nCanadian U Sports college football: Montreal Carabins 30, Saskatchewan Huskies 16\n\nHula Bowl: Team Kai 38, Team Aina 21, in DeLand, Florida on January 10th at 11:00 a.m. CT\n\nTropical Bowl: American Team vs. National Team in Orlando, Florida on January 18th at 10:00 a.m. CT\n\nAmerican Bowl: Warhawks vs. Guardians in Lakeland, Florida on January 22nd at 7:00 p.m. CT\n\nEast-West Shrine Bowl: East Team vs. West Team in Frisco, Texas on January 27th at 6:00 p.m. CT\n\nSenior Bowl: American Team vs. National Team in Mobile, Alabama on January 31st at 1:30 p.m. CT\n\nHBCU Legacy Bowl: Team Robinson vs. Team Gaither in New Orleans, Louisiana on February 21st at 3:00 p.m. CT\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Who will win the college football championship for the 2025 season?",

    "title": "Wired: \"Tech Workers Are Condemning ICE Even as Their CEOs Stay Quiet\"",
    "description": "The killing of George Floyd in 2020 prompted a wave of statements from tech companies and CEOs. Today, pushback against ICE is largely coming from employees, not executives.",
    "fullText": "returned to the White House last January, the biggest names in tech have mostly fallen in line with the new regime, attending dinners with officials, heaping praise upon the administration, presenting the president with lavish gifts, and pleading for Trump’s permission to sell their products to China. It’s been largely business as usual for Silicon Valley over the past year, even as the administration ignored a wide range of constitutional norms and attempted to slap arbitrary fees on everything from chip exports to worker visas for high-skilled immigrants employed by tech firms.\n\nBut after an ICE agent shot and killed an unarmed US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, in broad daylight in Minneapolis last week, a number of tech leaders have begun publicly speaking out about the Trump administration’s tactics. This includes prominent researchers at Google and Anthropic, who have denounced the killing as callous and immoral. The most wealthy and powerful tech CEOs are still staying silent as ICE floods America’s streets, but now some researchers and engineers working for them have chosen to break rank.\n\nMore than 150 tech workers so far have signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence. Anne Diemer, a human resources consultant and former Stripe employee who organized the petition, says that workers at Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, TikTok, Spotify, Salesforce, Linkedin, and Rippling are among those who have signed. The group plans to make the list public once they reach 200 signatories.\n\n“I think so many tech folks have felt like they can’t speak up,” Diemer told WIRED. “I want tech leaders to call the country’s leaders and condemn ICE’s actions, but even if this helps people find their people and take a small part in fighting fascism, then that’s cool, too.”\n\nNikhil Thorat, an engineer at Anthropic, said in a lengthy post on X that Good’s killing had “stirred something” in him. “A mother was gunned down in the street by ICE, and the government doesn’t even have the decency to perform a scripted condolence,” he wrote. Thorat added that the moral foundation of modern society is “infected, and is festering,” and the country is living through a “cosplay” of Nazi Germany, a time when people also stayed silent out of fear.\n\nJonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, added a “+1” to Thorat’s post. Shrisha Radhakrishna, chief technology and chief product officer of real estate platform Opendoor, replied that what happened to Good is “not normal. It's immoral. The speed at which the administration is moving to dehumanize a mother is terrifying.” Other users who identified themselves as employees at OpenAI and Anthropic also responded in support of Thorat.\n\nShortly after Good was shot, Jeff Dean, an early Google employee and University of Minnesota graduate who is now the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, began re-sharing posts with his 400,000 X followers criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, including one outlining circumstances in which deadly force isn’t justified for police officers interacting with moving vehicles.\n\nHe then weighed in himself. “This is completely not okay, and we can't become numb to repeated instances of illegal and unconstitutional action by government agencies,” Dean wrote in an X post on January 10. “The recent days have been horrific.” He linked to a video of a teenager—identified as a US citizen—being violently arrested at a Target in Richfield, Minnesota.\n\nIn response to US vice president JD Vance’s assertion on X that Good was trying to run over the ICE agent with her vehicle, Aaron Levie, the CEO of the cloud storage company Box, replied, “Why is he shooting after he’s fully out of harm’s way (2nd and 3rd shot)? Why doesn’t he just move away from the vehicle instead of standing in front of it?” He added a screenshot of a Justice Department web page outlining best practices for law enforcement officers interacting with suspects in moving vehicles.",

    "description": "The tariffs will allow President Trump to take a cut of Nvidia’s chip sales to China while putting off a decision about imposing higher taxes on the chip industry.",
    "fullText": "President Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday to impose a 25 percent tariff on a narrow list of foreign semiconductors, providing a way for the government to earn revenue off the sale of lucrative chips used in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe tariff, which would take effect Thursday, is far more limited than what the president initially threatened. Last year, the administration began an investigation aimed at encouraging tech companies and chip makers to buy semiconductors made in America. But instead of approving sweeping tariffs that would affect the industry, Wednesday’s announcement showed the administration has settled for narrower levies that allow it to take a cut of artificial intelligence chips sold to China.\n\nA document released by the White House said a 25 percent tariff would be put on A.I. chips made by companies like Nvidia and AMD that are imported into the United States and then re-exported to other countries. The tariff would not apply to semiconductors that are brought into the country to be used domestically in data centers or in products for American consumers, industry or the government. But it would allow the U.S. government to collect revenue from the sale of A.I. chips to China, an idea Mr. Trump proposed last year.\n\nThe president may still impose broader tariffs on semiconductor imports and products containing them in the near future, the White House said, including a program that would provide tariff relief for companies that manufacture chips domestically.\n\nFor now, though, the arrangement will very likely be welcomed by major chip companies that have lobbied fiercely to limit the scope of any tariffs. Most chip companies manufacture the bulk of their products in Taiwan or East Asia, where many of the world’s electronics are made, and ship them into the United States only if they are to be used domestically.\n\nMr. Trump threatened last August to impose a 100 percent tariff on foreign semiconductors unless manufacturers committed to invest in the United States. But chip tariffs had the potential to rankle foreign governments, as well as many of the tech companies that have grown close with the president. The administration has been particularly cautious of disrupting a trade truce that it reached last year with China, a major manufacturer of semiconductors.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday avoided any such impacts, while also allowing Mr. Trump to realize his plans to take a 25 percent cut of the revenue that Nvidia, the A.I. chip giant, will make from selling advanced chips to China.\n\nMr. Trump first floated the plan in August but was forbidden by U.S. law to tax exports or export licenses. So administration officials proposed a circuitous solution where they would bring Nvidia chips manufactured in Asia into the United States and impose a 25 percent tariff on the imported chip, before re-exporting the products to China.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Commerce issued a rule to permit the sale of a more advanced A.I. chip made by Nvidia, the H200, to China. Mr. Trump had banned the sale of those chips last year out of national security concerns, but abruptly reversed himself after Nvidia argued that exporting the chips was important for American global technology leadership. Nvidia’s chief executive, Jensen Huang, has become one of Mr. Trump’s closest allies in the tech world.\n\nMr. Trump started the chips inquiry under a national security-related law known as Section 232, which he has used to apply tariffs to other sectors, including a 50 percent tariff on all steel imports and a 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.\n\nThe White House also said Wednesday that it had concluded a Section 232 investigation into critical minerals, including lithium, gallium, germanium, cobalt and nickel. An executive order said the administration would refrain from putting tariffs on the sector for now.\n\nInstead, the order directed officials to negotiate trade agreements that would provide the United States more access to critical minerals, which are used in things ranging from cars to airplanes to A.I. data centers. The United States is heavily reliant on other countries — including China — for those minerals.\n\nSome analysts have questioned whether the Trump administration is backing away from heftier tariffs amid rising concerns among Americans about affordability. High prices were a key issue that helped propel Democrats to electoral wins in November. In an economic speech on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called affordability a “fake word by Democrats” but also detailed various steps his administration had taken to lower prices.\n\nBecause semiconductors are in almost everything with an on-off switch, chip companies had warned the administration that more expansive tariffs could lead to widespread price increases across the American economy.\n\nOthers have told the administration that a 25 percent surcharge on the machinery they need to manufacture chips, which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, would make semiconductor factories in the United States unviable.\n\nLast year, the United States imported roughly $45 billion in semiconductor chips, primarily from Taiwan and Malaysia, according to Bernstein Research.\n\nMr. Trump had said companies that have committed to building in the United States wouldn’t pay tariffs, and Commerce Department employees have been working on an arrangement that would offer tariff exemptions to companies that invest domestically. Last year, the chief executives of Apple, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer, pledged more than $1 trillion in U.S. investments as they sought to avoid fees.\n\nSemiconductor companies have been forced to accept uncertainty under Mr. Trump. Since returning to office, he has threatened to take away government grants, restricted chip sales to China, demanded investments and recommended that one company, Intel, fire its chief executive.\n\nThe intrusions have paralyzed an industry that less than a year earlier signed contracts with the Biden administration to release tens of billions of dollars in subsidies to build factories. Mr. Trump immediately put the industry on edge by criticizing those programs as wasteful, and had his staff ask firms for more investments before releasing the money.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has also seemed attuned to the concerns of tech C.E.O.s, particularly Mr. Huang and Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook. In April, the administration gave the technology industry a lucrative carve-out from its global tariffs, saying electronics would soon be subject to other tariffs under Section 232. No other industry has received such a broad exemption.",

    "description": "You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS.",
    "fullText": "You might have heard recently that Safari Technology Preview 234 landed the final plan for supporting masonry-style layouts in CSS. It’s called Grid Lanes.\n\nCSS Grid Lanes adds a whole new capability to CSS Grid. It lets you line up content in either columns or rows — and not both.\n\nThis layout pattern allows content of various aspect ratios to pack together. No longer do you need to truncate content artificially to make it fit. Plus, the content that’s earlier in the HTML gets grouped together towards the start of the container. If new items get lazy loaded, they appear at the end without reshuffling what’s already on screen.\n\nIt can be tricky to understand the content flow pattern as you are learning Grid Lanes. The content is not flowing down the first column to the very bottom of the container, and then back up to the top of the second column. (If you want that pattern, use CSS Multicolumn or Flexbox.)\n\nWith Grid Lanes, the content flows perpendicular to the layout shape you created. When you define columns, the content flows back and forth across those columns, just like to how it would if rows existed. If you define rows, the content will flow up and down through the rows — in the column direction, as if columns were there.\n\nHaving a way to see the order of items can make it easier to understand this content flow. Introducing the CSS Grid Lanes Inspector in Safari. It’s just the regular Grid Inspector, now with more features.\n\nSafari’s Grid Inspector already reveals the grid lines for Grid Lanes, and labels track sizes, line numbers, line names, and area names. Now it has a new feature — “Order Numbers”.\n\nYou might be tempted to believe the content order doesn’t matter. With pages like this photo gallery — most users will have no idea how the photos are ordered in the HTML. But for many users, the content order has a big impact on their experience. You should always consider what it’s like to tab through content — watching one item after another sequentially come into focus. Consider what it’s like to listen to the site through a screenreader while navigating by touch or keyboard. With Grid Lanes, you can adjust flow-tolerance to reduce the jumping around and put items where people expect.\n\nTo know which value for flow tolerance to choose, it really helps to quickly see the order of items. That makes it immediately clear how your CSS impacts the result.\n\nOrder Numbers in the Grid Inspector is an extension of a feature Safari’s Flexbox Inspector has had since Safari 16.0 — marking the order of Flex items. Seeing content order is also helpful when using the order property in Flexbox.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector works for CSS Grid and Subgrid, as well as Grid Lanes.\n\nThe Grid and Flexbox layout inspectors might seem similar across browsers, but the team behind Safari’s Web Inspector has taken the time to finely polish the details. In both the Grid and Flexbox Inspectors, you can simultaneously activate as many overlays as you want. No limits. And no janky scrolling due to performance struggles.\n\nSafari’s Flexbox Inspector visually distinguishes between excess free space and Flex gaps, since knowing which is which can solve confusion. It shows the boundaries of items, revealing how they are distributed both on the main axis and the cross axis of Flexbox containers. And it lists all the Flexbox containers, making it easier to understand what’s happening overall.\n\nOur Grid Inspector has a simple and clear interface, making it easy to understand the options. It also lists all Grid containers. And of course, you can change the default colors of the overlays, to best contrast with your site content.\n\nAnd Safari’s Grid and Flexbox Inspectors are the only browser devtools that label content order. We hope seeing the order of content in Grid Lanes helps you understand it more thoroughly and enjoy using this powerful new layout mechanism.\n\nOrder Numbers in Safari’s Grid Inspector shipped today in Safari Technology Preview 235. Let us know what you think. There’s still time to polish the details to make the most helpful tool possible. You can ping Jen Simmons on Bluesky or Mastodon with links, comments and ideas.",

    "description": "Officials ultimately banned fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv from attending a November match, a decision that has sparked immense criticism.",
    "fullText": "An apparent error by Microsoft's Copilot is roiling a UK police scandal.\n\nOn Monday, West Midlands Police chief constable Craig Guildford wrote to a Parliamentary committee that his officers did not catch a hallucination by Microsoft's AI tool when they were preparing their security recommendations for a soccer match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Aston Villa on November 6.\n\nUltimately, fans of Maccabi Tel Aviv were barred from attending the UEFA Europa League fixture, a decision that sparked a torrent of criticism reaching as high as Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nThe episode highlights the importance of all workers verifying AI output as the technology's adoption expands. A spokesperson for Microsoft said it could not replicate the results Guildford said the department received.\n\n\"Copilot combines information from multiple web sources into a single response with linked citations. It informs users they are interacting with an AI system and encourages them to review the sources,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nGuildford said that Microsoft Copilot provided false information about a game between Maccabi Tel Aviv and West Ham United, a different Premier League squad. That game never happened, but the details were used to inform a decision that led to the police force's decision to deny Maccabi Tel Aviv fans entry to the game against Aston Villa.\n\nOn Wednesday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told Parliament that she had lost confidence in Guildford.\n\nIn the letter, Guildford apologized to the parliamentary committee investigating the matter because he had testified that AI was not used by the force in preparing their recommendations. He had previously said a Google search provided the inaccurate information.\n\n\"I had understood and been advised that the match had been identified by way of a Google search in preparation for attending HAC. My belief that this was the case was honestly held, and there was no intention to mislead the Committee,\" he wrote.\n\nAccording to the BBC, more than 700 police officers were deployed ahead of the game. Multiple protests occurred outside the stadium. In November, West Midlands Police said they had classified the match as \"high risk.\"\n\nIn an October statement, the police force had said its decision was based on \"current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences\" that occurred during a separate game involving Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam the previous year.\n\nAs Israel's oldest soccer team, Maccabi Tel Aviv has spent decades trying to break through at the top levels of European soccer. The Europa League is UEFA's second-highest level of competition for continental teams, behind the Champions League.",

    "description": "California Attorney General Rob Bonta's investigation comes amid a growing backlash to xAI and its Grok chatbot.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk's xAI is now facing pressure from US regulators over Grok's generation of nonconsensual sexualized images of real people.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office was investigating the numerous reports of such images.\n\n\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"\n\nThe news comes after officials in India, the UK, Indonesia, and Malaysia have taken their own varying actions against Grok. Indonesia and Malaysia went so far as to block access to Grok.\n\nOfcom, the UK's communications regulator, announced its investigation earlier this week. Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously told lawmakers that X could \"lose the right to self-regulate.\"\n\nIn response to Business Insider's request for comment about Bonta's probe, xAI replied, \"Legacy Media Lies.\" Musk's AI company frequently responds to media requests with that line.\n\nAmid the backlash, xAI limited access to Grok's image generation to paying subscribers.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Musk said he was unaware of \"any naked underage images generated by Grok.\" Musk had previously said anyone asking Grok to make illegal content \"will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"\n\n\"Obviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images, it does so only according to user requests,\" Musk wrote on X. \"When asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state.\"\n\nMusk's statement belies many of the instances that regulators were looking into. Namely, the investigations were sparked by concerns about users asking Grok to sexualize images, such as depicting a person in a bikini when the original photo did not show them in such a state of dress.\n\nThe US Senate unanimously passed a bill via voice vote on Tuesday that would give victims a federal civil right to sue users who ask AI to create such images. The text of legislation, called \"The Defiance Act,\" mentions the digital manipulation of a photo to \"remove the clothing of the individual so that the person appears to be nude.\"\n\nSen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, who wrote the bill, said it was aimed at stopping instances like the Grok images.\n\n\"Recent reports showed that X, formerly Twitter, can ask its AI chatbot Grok to undress women and underage girls in photos,\" Durbin said on the Senate floor. \"Grok will comply to show various states of undress with images I won't repeat for the record, but they're horrible.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the bill will receive a vote in the House.\n\nLast year, President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation into law that requires social media platforms to remove non-consensual photos, as well as AI deepfakes, within 48 hours of receiving a request to do so.",

    "description": "Betting odds for who might succeed Powell have shifted. Bettors also think there's a growing chance Powell stays on as governor past the end of his term.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump could be fighting with the Fed all year.\n\nIn the days since it was revealed that the US Department of Justice is investigating Jerome Powell, a growing view among investors and analysts is that the Fed chair could end up sticking around after his term ends in May.\n\nThe DOJ's investigation relates to Powell's congressional testimony about the Fed's building renovations, and Trump has said he had no knowledge of the probe.\n\nStill, markets have interpreted the move as another attempt to influence the Fed to cut interest rates. They're also increasingly betting that the president's fight with the Fed will probably last beyond the end of Powell's term.\n\nSome say the latest developments have made it more likely that Powell will choose to stay on the Fed's board of governors even after his term as Fed Chair.\n\nOn Polymarket, the odds that Powell will leave the Fed board by the end of May and the end of December both plunged shortly after Powell released his video responding to the probe on January 11.\n\nBettors think there's a 45% chance Powell will leave the Fed by May 30, down from 74% earlier this month. They see a 62% chance he will leave the Fed by the end of the year, down from 85% earlier in the month.\n\nBetting markets have also repriced the odds that Trump ally Kevin Hassett is nominated to replace Powell. Kevin Warsh, a more hawkish name on the list for Fed chair, began to pull ahead of Hassett on Polymarket around the time news of the DOJ probe began to circulate.\n\nAs far as lowering interest rates is concerned, Trump's fight with the Fed could end up having the opposite outcome the president is hoping for, according to Chris Whalen, analyst and chairman of Whalen Global Advisors.\n\n\"You're going to have a more hawkish FOMC as we have now, and then you're going to have Chairman Powell sitting there as a governor for the next two years till the end of Trump's term. That's not what they wanted,\" Whalen told Bloomberg on Tuesday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nThere's a reason markets see the latest pressure on Powell backfiring. The logic goes something like this:\n\n\"I think that Trump is in perilous waters right now when it comes to his Fed appointment,\" Whalen added. \"I think Kevin Hassett may be done.\"\n\nThe investigation into Powell could also delay the confirmation of the next Fed Chair.\n\n\"I always thought there was an informal agreement since last summer between Trump and Powell, that if Powell agrees to leave the Fed when his chairmanship ends in May, then Trump will not bring up the construction project anymore,\" Clifton told CNBC on Tuesday, referring to how Trump criticized the Fed's multibillion renovation before the president cooled criticism of the central bank through the second half of the year.\n\n\"That line was crossed on Sunday one way or another,\" Clifton said. \"It makes it more likely that Powell can stay on a seat as a regular member.\"\n\nIt also means Powell could become a \"shadow Fed Chair\" himself, Clifton suggested, referring to an idea the Trump administration floated about an incoming central bank chief who can influence monetary policy expectations before the end of Powell's term.\n\n\"I think Donald Trump has mishandled the Fed. The way to have dealt with this was to simply say, 'You know, he hasn't done a good job. We're looking forward to getting a new chairman.' That's it,\" Whalen said, adding that he now expected Powell to stay on the Fed's board until his term as governor ends in 2028. \"By attacking Powell personally, continuously, I think they're not going to get what they want.\"",

Interior Concepts, told BI that instead of placing your sofa up against the wall, you should consider \"floating\" it.\n\n\"Floating furniture means that you place pieces off the wall, sometimes in the middle of the room,\" she said. \"When you do this in your living room, it makes the room feel and look larger because you will be able to walk around it.\"\n\nThough this won't work for all spaces — especially smaller ones with limited options for furniture placement — it's worth trying.\n\nWalk into a furniture showroom, and you're likely to find that almost everything is sold in sets — including living-room furniture.\n\n\"The easiest thing would be to purchase an entire set, but don't do it,\" White said. \"A space that looks too 'matchy-matchy' isn't a good thing.\"\n\nUsing separate pieces instead of sets can make your space look \"curated,\" she said, which \"elevates the style in your home.\"\n\nDesign is more than having a home that looks pretty — you should also be taking ergonomics into account.\n\n\"I know that placing your TV over the fireplace is the 'it' thing to do, but it does a huge disservice to your neck,\" White said.\n\n\"Your TV should be eye-level to where you are sitting,\" she said. \"You should not have to look up.\"\n\nYou shouldn't sacrifice comfort for style — and, if you do, your space might feel a bit unwelcoming or even sterile.\n\n\"Comfortability is one of the biggest factors that make a living room,\" Sonja Rasula, a former interior designer on HGTV's \"Home to Go\" who founded Unique Markets in Los Angeles, told BI.\n\nChoose a couch that's actually great to lounge on, a rug that's soft enough to enjoy barefoot, and definitely add some comfortable touches to your space.\n\n\"Even if you are balling on a budget, adding a cozy blanket or a few plush pillows will make all the difference,\" she added.\n\nLiving rooms are multifunctional, and your lighting choices should reflect that, Sara Ray, an interior designer based in Nashville, told BI.\n\n\"There should be overhead lighting on a dimmer that can be used to move throughout the space or dimmed to provide the right ambiance for a party,\" she said. \"You want to have plenty of secondary lighting so that tasks like reading can be done while sitting in the space.\"\n\nShe suggested placing accent lighting on bookshelves, on a fireplace mantel, or above artwork to create layers of lighting in your living room.\n\nPicking out the right furniture is important, but where you put it is equally essential to designing a living room.\n\n\"Large pieces in a small space can make the room look even smaller, where small pieces in a large space can leave too much empty space,\" Rasula told BI.\n\nFor larger living rooms, she recommends leaving 30 to 36 inches of space between furniture pieces. In smaller spaces, like apartments, you can probably get away with 18 to 24 inches between pieces.\n\n\"This amount of distance will ensure you're not overcrowding your living room while at the same time will help maximize space for a smaller living room,\" she said.\n\nWhether you've got great built-ins or have added bookshelves or ledges to your living room, you'll want to be careful when filling them up.\n\n\"You should utilize shelving space as much as possible, but try and avoid overhang, which could cause the space to look overcrowded,\" she told BI.\n\nShe explained that overhang occurs when items are too large for the shelf or bookcase, causing them to stick out over the ledge.\n\nSince a living room is often well-trafficked, you should probably have ample places to set down your drinks, books, and other items, Ray told BI.\n\n\"To create a functional living room, you should have a surface that you can easily reach from wherever you're sitting,\" she said.\n\nConsider including at least one or two side tables and a coffee table in your space — plus more surfaces if you've got the room.\n\nThis story was originally published in November 2019 and most recently updated on January 14, 2025.",

    "description": "A crypto token promoted by Eric Adams is linked to Sefi Zvieli, a landlord whose Brooklyn property became a city-backed homeless shelter.",
    "fullText": "A cryptocurrency promoted this week by former New York City mayor Eric Adams spiked in value before rapidly losing most of its gains, and is connected to a landlord who previously secured a lucrative city-backed homeless shelter deal after hiring a lawyer with close ties to Adams.\n\nAdams told journalists Monday morning that the \"NYC Token\" project would generate money to fund blockchain education for underserved New Yorkers and fight antisemitism and \"anti-Americanism.\"\n\nHe didn't say how, or specify who he was working with, but said he wasn't drawing a salary yet.\n\nThe project's website mentions an entity called C18 Digital LLC in its terms of service. An entity with that name was formed in Delaware on December 30. The certificate of formation was signed by Sefi Zvieli.\n\nThe City, a nonprofit news outlet, reported in 2023 that Zvieli avoided foreclosure on a \"filthy, fetid, and dangerous\" block of student housing he owned in Brooklyn by inking a deal to rent it to a New York City-financed nonprofit as a homeless shelter for $3.5 million a year.\n\nThe story said he snagged the deal after hiring Frank Carone, a lawyer with close ties to Adams, after Adams had won the New York City mayoral election but before he was sworn in as mayor. Zvieli has also been listed in public records for various New York companies and has been described by Israeli news outlets as a hotel investor.\n\nIt's unclear what role Zvieli played in NYC Token beyond signing the formation papers. He didn't reply to an email address listed for him in website registration records. Carone didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe token's trading history showed what happened in the hours after Adams plugged it: After peaking around 50 cents per token, its price fell to less than 9 cents per token. It has since risen to around 13 cents per token.\n\nSocial media users who said they had purchased the coin expressed outrage, accusing Adams or people affiliated with the project of stealing funds. The crypto analytics company Bubblemaps said in posts on X that a wallet withdrew $2.5 million of sales proceeds from a liquidity pool associated with NYC Token shortly before its value collapsed, before putting about $1.5 million back.\n\nElissa Buchter, a spokesperson for NYC Token, said in an email that the token's backers were not responsible for its wild performance.\n\n\"Our market maker made adjustments in an attempt to keep trading running smoothly, and as part of this process, moved liquidity,\" she said in an email. \"The team has not sold any tokens and is subject to lockups and transfer restrictions. THE TEAM HAS NOT WITHDRAWN ANY MONEY FROM THE ACCOUNT.\"\n\nA spokesman for Adams shared a statement in which Adams denied profiting from the token's launch, said he didn't personally invest in the token, and said \"no money was taken out of NYC Token.\"\n\n\"The NYC Token was designed as a free, voluntary way to support educational and nonprofit efforts,\" said the spokesman, Todd Shapiro. \"Claims suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.\"\n\nAs mayor, Adams was friendly with some figures in the cryptocurrency industry and converted some of his paychecks to bitcoin. In interviews on Monday, he twice referred to blockchains, the technology that acts as a ledger for many digital asset transactions, as \"blockchange.\"\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the NYC Token, it's so far faring better than \"NYCCoin,\" a token that Adams boosted early in his mayoralty. Trading on that dried up, and it was reportedly disavowed by the city and delisted by its main exchange in 2023.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump wants credit card interest rates capped at 10%. At least one company has already moved to do so.\n\nBilt Rewards announced a new suite of credit cards on Wednesday called \"Bilt 2.0,\" which will offers new cardholders 10% interest rates for their first year.\n\n\"We want to be on the side of this conversation, for right now, on the side of consumers and affordability,\" Bilt Rewards CEO Ankur Jain told Fox Business on Wednesday. \"On new purchases of the Bilt card, we're going to make sure that our consumers have access to that lower 10%.\"\n\nBilt is known for allowing users to earn rewards on rent and mortgage payments without the related fees associated with other credit cards.\n\nThe company unveiled three cards, including:\n\nAfter one year, interest rates for new cardholders will increase to between 26.74% to 37.47%, depending on the card.\n\nTrump called for the 10% cap in a Truth Social post on Friday, saying that he will \"no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more.\"\n\nFor now, any action taken by credit card companies is voluntary. Trump can't make the change by himself — he'll need an act of Congress in order to do so.\n\nIndependent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have introduced a bill to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a period of five years. Trump also called Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Monday to discuss the issue.\n\nHowever, House Speaker Mike Johnson has thrown cold water on the idea, saying that Trump \"probably had not thought through\" the potential downsides of the policy, including the possibility that credit card companies would \"just stop lending money\" or \"cap what people are able to borrow at a very low amount.\"\n\nBusiness leaders have offered mixed reviews of Trump's proposal, with some making the same argument as Johnson.\n\n\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would, or could, support, frankly,\" Citi's chief financial officer, Mark Mason, said on a call with reporters. \"At the end of the day, I think an interest rate cap would restrict access to credit to those who need it the most, and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy.\"",

    "description": "Business Insider found where 44 of Microsoft's data centers are located as of 2024. It promised this week consumers won't be on the hook for them.",
    "fullText": "As backlash intensifies against data centers nationwide, Microsoft says it has a plan.\n\n\"We'll pay our way to ensure our datacenters don't increase your electricity prices,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, wrote in a blog post one day after President Trump said in a Truth Social post that he does not want Americans to \"pick up the tab\" for data center electricity costs. Microsoft, he said, was \"first up.\"\n\nThe announcement comes amid an unprecedented data center construction boom across the US. Developers filed permits for 1,240 data centers in the US as of 2024 — roughly quadruple the level in 2010, according to a 2025 Business Insider investigation.\n\nWith it has come concerns over rising consumer electricity costs and grassroots opposition to construction buildouts.\n\nMicrosoft filed permits for 44 data centers as of the end of 2024, Business Insider found, the fifth highest count in our analysis. Half of Microsoft's permitted facilities are among the very largest in the analysis — the 322 massive data centers that we estimated consume 40 megawatts of electricity or more each.\n\nTake a look at where Microsoft's data centers are found:\n\nTwenty-four of Microsoft's data centers are located in Virginia as of 2024, followed by Texas with eight, and Illinois and Iowa each with four, according to Business Insider's count.\n\nMicrosoft's data centers are extremely electricity-intensive, Business Insider's analysis suggests. Its most power-intensive facility as of 2024 is in Maricopa County, Arizona, according to the analysis.\n\nAmazon's 177 data centers are on pace to command the highest electricity demand in Business Insider's analysis at between 30 and 48 terawatt-hours a year. Microsoft — with only around a quarter of Amazon's facilities — claims the next-highest spot.\n\nWhen reached in 2025, a Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged that its data centers \"do not always run at 100% of their installed capacity.\" Amazon disputed Business Insider's methodology, and QTS declined to comment. Google and Meta did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nIf all of Microsoft's 44 permitted facilities come online, their electricity demand could reach between 16 and 25 terawatt-hours a year, according to Business Insider's estimate. The midpoint of that range is about as much electricity as 1.8 million US homes based on average annual use.\n\nIf every permitted facility in Business Insider's dataset comes online, their electricity demand could reach between 149.6 terawatt-hours and 239.3 terawatt-hours annually, Business Insider's investigation found.\n\nThe low end of Business Insider's estimate is roughly equivalent to the state of Ohio's electricity needs in 2023, and on the high end, is nearly as much power as the entire state of Florida used that same year. A 2024 federal report projects demand could reach levels at the higher end of Business Insider's estimates by 2026.\n\nThe location of data centers has sparked a surge in community outcry, with neighboring residents concerned about their impact on rising electricity prices. Data centers' extreme electricity demand frequently requires utilities to build out new grid infrastructure. Utilities often socialize the investment costs, shifting billions of dollars of costs to all ratepayers, including residential customers, a Business Insider investigation found.\n\n\"Utilities can fund discounts to Big Tech by socializing their costs through electricity prices charged to the public,\" a 2025 Harvard Law study of regulatory proceedings about utility rates for data centers found.\n\nTo ensure Microsoft's data centers do not increase residential electricity bills, Smith, Microsoft's president, wrote that the tech giant plans to ask utilities and regulators to set the company's rates high enough to cover its data centers' electricity costs.\n\nSmith pointed to Microsoft's recent support of new electricity rates that charge \"very large customers,\" such as data centers, for the costs incurred to provide them with electricity. Smith also said that when grid infrastructure improvements were necessary to serve its data centers, the company would pay for those improvements.\n\n\"We believe the long-term success of AI infrastructure requires that tech companies pay their own way for the electricity costs they create,\" Smith wrote.\n\nThe promise comes amid a broader affordability push from President Trump, including plans to lower mortgage rates and cap credit card interest rates.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Never underestimate the power of financial incentives. Even for tech billionaires.",
    "fullText": "\"You get what you measure\" is one of my favorite concepts in modern business. It means people and organizations tend to focus their behavior on whatever metrics get tracked and rewarded.\n\nThis even applies to tech billionaires.\n\nThis week, CEO Elon Musk said Tesla will make its FSD service subscription-only and remove the option to buy it outright.\n\nOn social media, Elon stans theorized and argued with Elon-haters over the reason for this change. As usual, the debate was devoid of nuance. Fans took this as another sign of the Tesla CEO's genius. Critics argued this proves FSD doesn't work and is doomed.\n\nAs usual, the truth lies elsewhere. Here's my theory, which my Business Insider colleague Tom Carter nodded at earlier.\n\nI think Tesla is getting what it measures. Musk's new compensation package, approved by shareholders late last year, has several tough targets the company must hit before he gets $1 trillion.\n\nAccording to Tesla's proxy filing, there are four product goals. Number 2 on the list is this: \"10 Million Active FSD Subscriptions.\"\n\nOne way Tesla can reach this milestone more quickly is to remove the option to buy FSD outright. By mid-February, anyone considering this option will need to subscribe instead.\n\nWhy would Tesla's board make this a goal for Musk? Subscriptions are a steadier business. Investors prefer continuous income generated by subscription businesses, versus lumpier operations that rely on large, one-time purchases. A pure FSD subscription also gives Tesla more flexibility to change pricing in the future.\n\nI think this is the main lesson, though: Never underestimate the power of financial incentives.\n\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the FSD change.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "The Miami Hurricanes will face the Indiana Hoosiers in the CFP National Championship. Tickets are available across several websites.",
    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff reaches a thrilling conclusion on Monday night, and there are a few avenues to explore if you're looking to attend in person. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about how to get College Football National Championship tickets in 2026, including a comparison of resale ticket prices.\n\nThe 2025 college football season concludes with a January 19, 2026, match-up between the No. 10 Miami Hurricanes and the No. 1 Indiana Hoosiers. The two teams will face off at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, home of the Miami Dolphins. Miami beat Ole Miss in the Fiesta Bowl, and Indiana defeated Oregon in the Peach Bowl, sending the playoff underdog and top seed to the National Championship, where they're both vying for a shot at their first national title in the CFP era.\n\nGetting your hands on tickets to the championship can be tricky, and most tickets are only available through resale sites at the moment. We've compared prices across some of the top resellers, including StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nMost College Football Playoff National Championship tickets are sent to the respective schools involved and sold through each institution. On the Miami Hurricanes website, the Miami ticket allotment has sold out. We're also not seeing any tickets available through the Indiana Hoosiers website. This means that the resale ticket market is the next best place to snag a seat if you're still hoping to attend.\n\nThe official fan-to-fan exchange marketplace for the National Championship is through Ticketmaster, but we're also seeing listings on StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nThe cheapest resale listings we're seeing right now come from Vivid Seats, where ticket prices start at $2,899. On StubHub, the cheapest resale ticket listings start at $2,965. On Ticketmaster, the cheapest resale tickets start at $3,094. Prices are accurate at the time of writing, but they often fluctuate throughout the day as tickets are purchased and additional listings are added to the sites. The cheapest tickets are for Upper Level seats, while resale listings close to the field are reaching upwards of $15,000 across all sites.\n\nNote: Certain services and regions prohibit the resale of tickets. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal reselling of tickets, and entry into an event is at the venue's discretion.",

    "description": "Energy regulators and advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to \"pay its own way\" for the power needed to serve its AI footprint.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft is promising to cover the costs of electricity needed to power its rapidly growing fleet of data centers in suburban and rural communities across the US.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, Brad Smith, the president and vice chair of the Big Tech giant, said that going forward, Microsoft will \"pay utility rates that are high enough to cover our electricity costs.\"\n\nIt's a bold pledge to make at a time when AI is fueling a historic surge in demand for power in the US, and electric bills are surging for the average American utility customer.\n\nIt is also one that state regulators have heard before as utilities, their data center customers, and consumer advocates argue over who will bear the cost of new infrastructure needed to serve AI's enormous appetite for power.\n\nBut as the impact of data centers on electricity rates becomes an increasingly hot political flashpoint, Microsoft may have no other choice but to follow through, and the rest of Big Tech might not be far behind.\n\n\"There is no free lunch for tech players, and Trump is watching,\" said Dan Ives, global head of tech research at Wedbush Securities.\n\nIves expects other Big Tech companies to follow Microsoft's lead and make similar pledges addressing local concerns around major data center buildouts sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" President Trump wrote Monday night in a post on Truth Social.\n\nThe \"big technology companies who build them,\" the president said, \"must pay their own way.\"\n\nTrump wrote that his administration had collaborated with Microsoft on the company's pledge to cover its electricity costs, and alluded to future announcements by other companies.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, the White House Press Office pointed to President Trump's post on Truth Social.\n\nMicrosoft's four-part plan to ensure it is paying its fair share of electricity costs was laid out in a blog post this week. The plan consists of asking utilities and regulators to set their rates high enough to cover their data center costs, collaborating with utilities to cover the costs of new infrastructure, looking for ways to operate data centers more efficiently, and advocating for affordable, reliable power at the state and federal levels.\n\nWhen asked for further comment, a spokesperson for Microsoft pointed to the company's blog post.\n\nConsumer advocates are cautiously optimistic about Microsoft's promise to pay its fair share, but eager to see more details — especially from the utilities that serve the data centers.\n\n\"These are only rough concepts that don't get at the root of the problem, which is the scale and speed at which the industry is moving,\" said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Virginia's Piedmont Environmental Council.\n\nDominion Energy, Virginia's largest public utility, has said it is in contract talks with data center customers for 47 gigawatts of new demand — double Dominion's current peak load.\n\nBolthouse is concerned about the legitimacy of that demand — and who might end up footing the bill if it never comes to fruition.\n\n\"The current process of unreviewed contracts between utilities and data centers has broken the planning process and threatens the reliability of the system,\" said Bolthouse.\n\nCharles Hua, founder and director of Powerlines, a nonprofit that advocates for utility regulation reform, said that data centers can be \"good grid citizens\" if local utilities prioritize investment in grid-enhancing technologies and energy efficiency over building new power plants.\n\n\"Doing so will require states to reimagine our outdated system of utility regulation and make necessary changes to center consumers going forward,\" he said.",

    "description": "Irem Sumer and her four friends have spent two years working on \"Match Valley.\" Now they've got millions of dollars in backing from Silicon Valley.",
    "fullText": "On October 3, Irem Sumer signed a document that team leaders of nerdy crews worldwide dream of inking: a term sheet that raised $30 million in Series A funding for her Istanbul-based game company, Talemonster Games.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Sumer, the startup's CEO, was signing another important document — her marriage license.\n\n\"It was the most chaotic two weeks of my life,\" Sumer told Business Insider, adding that at one point, she told her then-fiancé that wedding planning would be left to him, and she'd just show up to get married.\n\nThat day in October capped off two years of work on the game \"Match Valley,\" the game title. The funding round was led by Arcadia Gaming Partners and Andreessen Horowitz with participation from Point72 Ventures and General Catalyst.\n\nThis comes after a seed funding round last February, when Talemonster Games' five cofounders raised $7 million to make their game and take it to market.\n\n\"I wasn't planning to fundraise in September because I believed it was a bit too early for us. But the metrics were good, and there was a lot of strategic interest in our company,\" Sumer said.\n\nSumer, a civil engineer by training, worked at Pfizer and Google before joining Peak Games as a product specialist in 2020. She worked there for just over three years, where she met colleagues who would later resign from the company alongside her to start Talemonster Games.\n\n\"I wanted to be in tech, and gaming was my passion, but I never thought that I could make money from it,\" Sumer said.\n\nThe five-member founding crew quit the same week, Sumer said, and resolved to dedicate 100% of their time to making what would become \"Match Valley.\"\n\nSumer estimates that her team played \"hundreds of games\" during their first month of market research. They then built the game together, pulling 18-hour shifts on most days to build its levels.\n\n\"It took us around three months to come up with this idea and lots of prototypes,\" Sumer said.\n\n\"Match Valley\" is built on basic puzzle-solving mechanics, much like \"Candy Crush,\" where gamers need to match objects to progress in levels. It's also integrated with tower defense and has a cast of hero characters with unique abilities.\n\nThe team launched the game in August after its seed round, when they had a stable version of the game at 200 levels. Then, they started to \"suffer from success,\" Sumer said.\n\n\"People consumed all our content in 10 days, and then they turned away from the game,\" Sumer said. \"We had to stop everything and start building more levels. I designed levels myself, too, and also we had to grow the team.\"\n\n\"Match Valley's\" current engagement metrics, Sumer says, helped convinced investors that their small startup is worth pouring money into.\n\n\"The game's core audience is still female dominant, but they are spending one and a half hours on average per player in the game,\" she told Business Insider. On average, players spent two and a half hours in their first day in-game, she said.\n\nThe game makes money from its in-app purchase model, Sumer said.\n\nSumer said she and her cofounders managed to get investor Josh Lu and his team at A16z Speedrun on board with Talemonster after a message on LinkedIn. Sumer says she slid into Lu's LinkedIn DMs after a post he made about being on the lookout for interesting games.\n\n\"I thought, he's basically describing our prototype, that can't be a coincidence. So we reached out to him with a cold text, and he just fell in love with the prototype,\" Sumer said of her exchange with Lu.\n\nIn a press release announcing the Series A funding, Lu praised Sumer and her team for never taking \"the easy route.\"\n\n\"They've built an original product and a culture that isn't afraid to challenge the industry,\" said he added.\n\nThe $30 million funding round will go to growing \"Match Valley,\" and building a new game that they plan to release this year. TaleMonster has 32 staff, working across engineering, art, product management, level design, and marketing.\n\n\"I don't plan to hire too many people,\" Sumer said, adding that she likes \"lean, high-responsibility teams.\"\n\nSumer told Business Insider she has three pieces of advice for people looking to build a gaming startup.\n\n\"When you are starting from scratch, I think it's on you to be brave. You have nothing to lose,\" she said.\n\nSecondly, it's important to pick the right partners.\n\n\"The team you create, the culture you create, the investors you accept, they have to share the same vision with you,\" she said. \"And it's a painful process because you have to say lots of nos.\"\n\nAnd lastly, she said to celebrate wins, despite the daily anxiety of running a new company.\n\n\"You are always in this grind mode, and you always have to think about your next goal, and the next after that,\" Sumer said. \"I think you have to stop and say, 'I mean, we are achieving great stuff, so we have to celebrate it together.'\"",

    "fullText": "A Ford employee who was suspended after heckling President Donald Trump has sparked an outpouring of crowdfunding support.\n\nThe GoFundMe donations, totaling over $800,000 in less than 24 hours, come after the Ford line worker, TJ Sabula, told The Washington Post that he heckled Trump during the President's visit to his workplace.\n\nTrump visited a Michigan plant on Tuesday where the automaker builds its best-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck. The brief visit was intended to highlight the White House's commitment to rebuilding the US workforce and Ford's focus on rebuilding a blue-collar workforce pipeline.\n\nVideo from the event obtained by TMZ shows Trump gesturing after someone shouted \"pedophile protector\" — which Sabula has since said was him — in an apparent reference to White House's delay in releasing the full Epstein files. The President can be seen raising his middle finger after the remark and mouthing an expletive.\n\nThe White House told several news outlets that Trump was appropriately responding to \"a lunatic\" who \"was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage.\"\n\nA source at the United Auto Workers (UAW), the union that represents the Ford plant, confirmed to Business Insider that Sabula was suspended.\n\n\"The autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union—the UAW,\" Laura Dickerson, the vice president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), told Business Insider in an email.\n\n\"He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"\n\nDickerson said the UAW is reviewing Sabula's suspension.\n\n\"Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States,\" she added.\n\nSabula told the Post that he has \"no regrets whatsoever.\"\n\n\"I don't feel as though fate looks upon you often, and when it does, you better be ready to seize the opportunity,\" he added.\n\n\"TJ and his family greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time, we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support,\" read an update on both campaigns. \"We appreciate every single donation, comment, share, and sign of support!\"\n\n\"TJ Sabula is a patriot,\" said one of the GoFundMe campaigns, which more than 21,000 people donated to.\n\n\"Let's rally and support TJ and help him pay some bills (and force DJT to release the Trump/Epstein Files),\" continues the post, which was published last night.\n\nIn November, Trump signed a bipartisan bill called the Epstein Files Transparency Act that required the release of all FBI materials from the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein by December 19, 2025. While some files have been released, the Department of Justice said it's still scrambling to review around 5.2 million remaining documents weeks after the mandated release date.\n\n\"TJ Sabula, a worker at the Ford Rouge Plant, voiced concerns about President Donald J Trump during the president's visit to the plant. Ford responded by suspending TJ without pay,\" reads a second GoFundMe organized by Diandra Gourlay, which has raised money from over 13,000 people.\n\nGourlay described herself as \"a longtime personal friend of the Sabula family.\"\n\nBoth GoFundMe campaigns list \"Thomas Sabula\" as the official beneficiary of the donations. Neither page owner immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nSabula, Ford, and the White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "title": "GM's CEO Just Admitted An Uncomfortable Truth About Plug-In Hybrids",
    "description": "General Motors CEO Mary Barra has a grim assessment for drivers of plug-in hybrids: \"They don't plug them in.\"",
    "fullText": "General Motors CEO Mary Barra said the company remains committed to an \"an EV future,\" despite industry headwinds.\n\nThe automaker is looking at hybrid options in the meantime, Barra said, as it currently offers none.\n\nThere's just one problem with plug-in hybrids, and that's making sure people actually plug them in.\n\nOn paper, China's Chevrolet Equinox Plus Plug-In Hybrid seems like a shoo-in for the United States. Here's a familiar nameplate, in a practical crossover body, that pairs a gas engine with battery power for more than 600 miles of total range on China's testing cycle.\n\nBut for a litany of reasons, it's not coming to this market, leaving Americans with the gas Equinox and the popular Equinox EV instead. In the U.S., General Motors has broadly stayed away from hybrid power of all sorts in order to focus on what CEO Mary Barra calls the \"end game\": a fully-electric future.\n\nStay informed with our newsletter every weekday   back \n\nAnd at the Automotive Press Association conference in Detroit on Monday, Barra spoke an uncomfortable truth about plug-in hybrids in America.\n\n\"What we also know today with plug-in hybrids is that most people don't plug them in,\" she said. \"So that's why we're trying to be very thoughtful about what we do from a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid perspective.\"\n\nYou can see Barra's remarks about hybrids to Reuters reporter Kalea Hall in the video below.\n\nBarra's comments are perhaps the most stark admission yet—and certainly, from the highest-ranking auto executive—about a truth in the auto industry that is widely known but barely acknowledged.\n\nPlug-in hybrids (PHEVs) pair a gasoline engine with what's typically a small battery to boost fuel economy and range by running on electric power some of the time. Usually, those batteries are larger than those found in regular hybrids, which requires them to be plugged in. They're especially popular in Europe and China, but do require someone to put gas in a car and plug it in, using a wall outlet or a traditional home EV charger. Since PHEVs can typically cover between 30 and 50 miles using battery power only, they are often touted as a way to bridge the gap between gas cars and electric ones.\n\nIn 2024, InsideEVs' contributor John Voelcker investigated the user behavior around PHEVs, specifically whether owners actually plug them in or not. He reached out to several automakers to ask whether they had, or could offer, recent data about plug habits for these cars; they either would not provide that data or could not say.\n\nThat may be because PHEVs have come under fire in recent years, as multiple studies reported that owners broadly do not plug them in. \"We find that current PHEVs show electric drive shares much lower than assumed in EPA labeling,\" the International Council on Clean Transportation said in 2022. \"A consequence of this comparatively low electric drive share is that real-world fuel consumption is 42%–67% higher than EPA-label fuel consumption.\"\n\nIn other words, because drivers don't plug the cars in, they're not getting the fullest benefits from their powertrains—lugging around a near-dead battery and using much more fuel than they should. The problem has been worse in Europe, where PHEV models are even more pervasive. Studies show that the lack of plug use means emissions were far higher than expected.\n\nAs EV sales slow down in America, some automakers have pointed to PHEVs as a better near-term solution for electrification. Hyundai, Toyota, Volvo and Mazda are all among those who offer several PHEV models right now. But cracks may be showing in the market as well. Without stricter fuel economy regulations or the EV tax credits, Jeep and Chrysler parent company Stellantis recently opted to axe its PHEV models entirely, despite being behind the best-selling PHEV model in the country.\n\nMore recently, automakers are hanging their hopes on extended-range electric vehicles, or EREVs. Those could be described as a kind of PHEV in reverse. They start with an EV-sized battery and platform, and add a gas engine to recharge that battery. Yet if EREVs too need to be plugged in and filled with gas, automakers may run into the exact same problem with users.\n\nIn GM's case, its only hybrid is the Chevrolet Corvette E-Ray and its only PHEV models are sold in China. The automaker helped to popularize the field more than 15 years ago with the groundbreaking Chevrolet Volt. Now, amid the EV slowdown, GM is looking to bring more hybrid and PHEV models to the U.S., possibly in 2027. How it will educate users to plug them in remains to be seen.\n\nStill, Barra said she does not regret GM's original strategy to bypass hybrids and go straight to EVs, even though the automaker has received criticism for that move.\n\n\"With everything we knew at that point in time, we'd make that same decision,\" Barra said. \"We have to be very thoughtful with our capital and how we deploy it.\"\n\nContact the author: patrick.george@insideevs.com\n\n2025 Was Big For Hybrids And PHEVs. 2026 Will Be Even Bigger\n\nThe Best Plug-In Hybrid Cars of 2025: PHEVs With Great Electric Range And Gas Mileage\n\nThis Controversial Plan Could Fix Plug-In Hybrids’ Dirty Secret\n\nPlug-In Hybrids: Do They Get Plugged In?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump posted a baffling social media post demanding that a U.S. citizen and Democratic congresswoman be “thrown out” of the country.\n\nThe president has been raging against Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for more than a month after news broke that some members of the Somali diaspora had allegedly defrauded the state of Minnesota by billing for social services that were never provided.\n\n“They should be thrown out of the USA. Get it done, NOW! That includes their loser Rep. Omar, who married her brother (gross!),” Trump wrote Wednesday on his platform Truth Social.\n\nHe then shared an interview with House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, saying the state’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz “should be in cuffs.”\n\nNeither Walz nor Omar, who fled Somalia’s civil war as a child, has been accused of any involvement in the fraud scheme.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who the president was addressing or how he envisioned “throwing out” Omar, since it’s unconstitutional to deport an American citizen. The 43-year-old spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before being granted asylum and moving to the U.S., becoming a citizen in 2000 at age 17.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Omar, Walz, and the White House for comment.\n\nThe president apparently became fixated on the idea of “throwing out” Omar after he saw a video, which he shared on Christmas Day, of former Fox News host Megyn Kelly calling Omar’s citizenship into question.\n\n“Throw her out of the U.S., Now!” he wrote.\n\nHe also railed against her last month at a Cabinet meeting at the White House and a campaign-style rally in Pennsylvania.\n\n“Ilhan Omar is garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people that work. These are people that say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great.’ These are people that do nothing but complain,” he told his Cabinet.\n\nLess than a week later, he took the stage at a rally in Pennsylvania and announced a “permanent pause” on migration from “hellholes” like Somalia, and once again raged against Omar until the crowd began chanting, “Send her back!”\n\nThe lawmaker responded by calling out Trump’s obsession with her, which she described as “creepy” and “weird.”\n\n“Trump’s obsession with me is beyond weird. He needs serious help,” she wrote on social media. “Since he has no economic policies to tout, he’s resorting to regurgitating bigoted lies instead. He continues to be a national embarrassment.”",

    "description": "See data as far back as when you first picked up a Nintendo Switch",
    "fullText": "It's not whoever gets to the flagpole first, but who does it with the most style. Following PlayStation and Steam, Nintendo has finally released an annual recap so you can pour over your Switch and Switch 2 stats for 2025, and as it turns out, even see your playtime data for as far back as when you first booted up a Nintendo Switch system.\n\nMid-January is a bit of a late release for one of these annual recaps, and last year's Nintendo Switch Year in Review came out in mid-December. However, since Metroid Prime 4 came out pretty shortly before that, I can see why Nintendo might have opted to wait this year. Plus, the delay gave people who got Nintendo Switch 2 systems for the holidays some time to get some stats on the book before year's end.\n\nLike last year, Nintendo's 2025 recap is available via browsers rather than a dedicated app. Just head to the recap webpage, sign into your Nintendo Account, and scroll to see all your stats.\n\nIf you started playing on a Nintendo Switch 2 system this year, you'll first see some congratulations for that, and then the real fun can begin. I'll post some examples from my Year in Review below, but be nice—I play most of my games on PC, and when I do play on Switch, it's mostly on my husband's profile. I swear I do \n\nAnyway, you'll start off looking at how many games and hours you played in total, and then get a short list of the games you played the most. After that, you'll get breakdowns by genre and month, and then comes the coolest part of this whole thing. You'll be able to pick your own personal game of the year from the games you've played, which will show up on a card you can share with others.\n\nIn a bit of a different twist, though, Nintendo's data doesn't end at 2025. Instead, if you keep scrolling, you'll see when you first started playing on a Nintendo Switch system, as well as your most played games for each of the years you've been playing Switch. Mouse over a game to see stats for it, or click the \"See Your Stats\" button in the lower-right corner to see detailed stats for that year, with a breakdown of your most played games, favorite genres that year, and playtime broken down by month.\n\nAt the end, you'll get a short shareable video with a bite-sized look at your entire Switch history, showing when you first started playing a Switch and/or Switch 2, which games you've played the most, and how long you've played each.\n\nIn that way, Nintendo's Year in Review is almost more of a Console in Review, but I suppose that makes sense—the original Switch hasn't been discontinued yet, but the Switch 2 did come out last year.\n\nAt any rate, it's always fun to see these recaps come to more than just music. And Nintendo still managed to beat Xbox to a 2025 recap, as Microsoft is reportedly skipping one of those, based on sources who spoke to Windows Central.",

    "title": "Eight DIY Choices That Might Actually Be Code Violations",
    "description": "That seemingly brilliant hack could come back to bite you.",
    "fullText": "DIY fixes around the house can save you a lot of money and headaches—with few basic skills and a few basic tools, you can tackle a wide range of home projects while other folks pay professionals enormous amounts of money to get the same work done.\n\nBut sometimes, you get what you pay for. Professionals may be pricey, but they bring with them a wealth of experience and knowledge that helps them avoid simple mistakes that can lead to real trouble—including code violations. A lot of DIYers tend to skip steps like pulling permits and inspections on the assumption that they’re not necessary for minor fixes, but hacks that seem like clever solutions when you’re DIY-ing can actually be illegal. And code violations can and will come back to haunt you once you try to sell the house, if not sooner.\n\nHere are some of the most common DIY choices that could also cause code violations.\n\nChanging electrical receptacles (also commonly, if incorrectly, referred to as outlets) is a relatively easy DIY project that just about anyone with a screwdriver can tackle, from upgrading to modern three-prong receptacles or adding USB capabilities. But even if your project is successful in the sense that you end up with working receptacles and you haven't electrocuted yourself or burned down the house, you can still wind up with a major code violation if you don’t use ground-fault circuit interruption (GFCI) receptacles in areas where water sources are present, such as bathrooms, kitchens, or laundry areas.\n\nThe applicable codes can be exacting when it comes to minimum distances from water sources, daisy-chaining receptacles, and using GFCI breakers instead of individual outlets. If you’re just slapping any old outlet into place, you’re probably violating electrical codes, even if everything works.\n\nIf you have a set of stairs that lacks a handrail (or has an old handrail that’s loose and coming free from the wall), it’s easy to buy a new one, cut it to size, and attach it to the wall with fresh screws. But if your handrail isn’t at the correct height (typically somewhere between 30 and 38 inches from the stair tread), you’re in violation of most residential codes. And if your handrail doesn’t make a 90-degree turn toward the wall, floor, or a post at the end—known as a return—you’re also violating code. It’s a safety issue, because clothing and straps can loop over the handrail as you start up or down the stairs, leading to a potential fall and injury.\n\nA few years after buying my house, I decided to replace the ugly ventilation fan in the bathroom. Imagine my surprise when I yanked that sucker out and discovered it was vented directly into the ceiling void. Ventilation fans in bathrooms, kitchens, or laundry rooms must vent outside the house, not into an attic or basement. Even if the fan you’re replacing currently vents into an interior space, you have make upgrades to vent it outside or your repair will also violate codes.\n\nIf you know that you need a metal electrical box when running wiring through your house, that’s great. If you cram way too many wires and clamps into that box, you’ll be in violation of the electrical code—and in real danger of burning down your house. Each electrical box is rated by volume—not the number of wires, but their total volume. Calculating this can be complex if you’re not deeply familiar with wiring, so a good rule of thumb is to avoiding adding wires to a box unless you’re absolutely certain you’re not breaking code by doing so.\n\nRunning electrical or plumbing work through walls, basements, or crawl spaces seems straightforward: You start at A, run the material to B, and close everything up. Except you will quickly run into a common problem when a beam or joist invariably blocks your wires or pipes from advancing.\n\nDrilling through studs to run wiring is pretty common, as is notching joists to squeeze pipes through. But if you cut into a load-bearing stud or beam with too large a notch, you can easily run into a code violation (and a dangerous one, at that). That’s because cutting into a load-bearing structure weakens it, and weakens everything it's supporting as a result. As with electrical work, the code for notching lumber in the house can be difficult to parse unless you’re experienced with it. You can usually use common sense here and be okay, but it’s also very easy to drill a hole or cut a notch that’s a little too large, setting yourself up for future headaches.\n\nDid you know that your breaker box is supposed to be clearly—and accurately—labeled? Unlabeled breakers (or, worse, incorrectly labeled breakers that don’t reflect changes to the wiring) are dangerous to anyone who works on them, because critical assumptions will be made based on those labels. If you did some DIY wiring in the house that’s otherwise up to code but you forgot to label or update your breakers, you’re violating code anyway.\n\nEveryone uses extension cords, whether it’s to bring power to something that can’t be plugged into the wall or as a temporary solution to a problem. With stress on the word temporary, because extension cords are never supposed to be used as permanent wiring. That means if you’ve been powering something in your basement, yard, or even a bedroom for a long time, you’re probably violating your local fire code. Extension cords are simply not rated for constant use—if you’ve been using one to deliver power for a while, it’s time to call an electrician and have some proper wiring done. (If you want to double extra violate that code, go ahead and run an extension cord—or even an appliance cord—inside your walls.)\n\nNeighbors can be nosy (and annoying), and the old saying that “good fences make good neighbors” is all too true. Just don’t let the desire for privacy and dominion over your lands lead you into violating local codes, because privacy fences usually have strict upper height limits. Most building codes limit privacy fencing to about six feet at most, so if you build a 12-foot green monster in your backyard to block your neighbor’s view of your sunbathing area, you’re setting yourself up for a future problem.",

    "title": "What I Learned After Trying Out Every Exoskeleton at CES",
    "description": "Some of them felt amazing—but all of them may be too expensive to reach the people they're meant for.",
    "fullText": "While I was covering CES, the big consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, I gave myself a side quest: try on every exoskeleton I could find. I kept seeing them at booths and events, promising to help me walk farther without fatigue, or reach my athletic potential as I'm (judging from their marketing videos) sprinting up a mountain. I ended up testing six of them—four assisted me at the hip, one at the knee, and one at the ankle.\n\nExoskeletons first landed on my radar as I was considering products for the Best of CES awards. I was helping to judge \"age tech\"—devices designed to help people as they age—and devices that assist with mobility were potentially in the running. But I was skeptical about whether consumer exoskeleton technology was mature enough to be safe and reliable, and whether people would realistically find exoskeletons convenient enough to use. Those are still open questions. In the end, we didn’t include any exoskeletons among our finalists, although I wouldn’t rule out the possibility for future years.\n\nMany of the exoskeleton companies positioned their products as fitness tech, with companies like Ascentiz and Hypershell using images of hikers and athletes in their marketing. My colleague James Bricknell from CNET took a Hypershell exoskeleton for a hike on a nearby canyon trail during CES, and said that it helped him easily keep up with more experienced hikers. (I borrowed that exact exoskeleton from him when we ran into each other in CNET’s newsroom and took it out for some impromptu sprints in the hallway.)\n\nFirst, since I know you all want to see what they looked like and hear how they felt, I’ll give you a tour of the ones I tried, ranked from my least to most favorite. Then, below, I’ll give some thoughts on whether I think exoskeletons are worthwhile, and what I learned after talking to an expert who uses medical grade exoskeletons for physical therapy in rehabilitation facilities.\n\nThis minimalist unit from WiRobotics was the last one I tried before leaving CES, and I’m sorry to say it comes in last place in my ranking as well. By this point, I’d tried several other hip-based exoskeletons that fit well and provided a significant boost to my walking and stepping. I loved the slim profile and simple design of the WIM-S—that is, until I turned it on. I was led up and down a mini staircase in the WiRobotics booth a few times before it was time to hand over the device to the next person in line. The WIM-S just didn’t feel like it was doing much.\n\nWiRobotics' design keeps the device fully in front of your hips, pushing down on the front of your leg. It feels a bit like when you push your hand against your knee to help you stand up. The WIM-S isn’t available for sale in the U.S. yet, but goes for the equivalent of $1,905 in South Korea.\n\nI first tried a Sumbu exoskeleton at CES Unveiled, a media preview event that occurs a few days before the show officially opens. For the first time that week, but not the last, I had people help me strap a belt around my waist and then they tightened cuffs around my legs just above my knees. Walking around, I could feel the device helping to move my legs; jogging in place, I commented that it would be nice if I could try these on stairs. Good news! The company’s real booth would have stairs.\n\nI visited the booth later on, in CES’s “Eureka Park” area dedicated to startups. I walked up and down the provided mini stairs, and felt the exoskeleton helping me easily step up, even when I took the stairs two at a time. I also stepped up onto the top of the stair unit when I was standing next to it—three stairs tall, I think—slightly surprising the people at the booth. But the exoskeleton made it feel easy.\n\nTo be totally honest, this exoskeleton and the next two I list (Ascentiz and Hypershell) all had a similar fit and feel. It’s tough to rank them against each other based on just a few minutes of testing for each, so take my conclusions with a grain of salt.\n\nSumbu sells three models of exoskeletons: the lightweight S3 ($1,199), the more powerful S3 Pro ($1,499), and the “maximum power” S3 Ultra ($1,999).\n\nAscentiz makes a modular exoskeleton that can assist you at both the hip and the knee, but only the hip module was available for me to try. Hip exoskeletons seemed to be more popular; including Ascentiz, I tried four hip exoskeletons this week, and only found one each of knee and ankle exoskeletons (not including Ascentiz—you’ll see the knee exoskeleton I did try below).\n\nEach exoskeleton basically treats a joint of your body as a hinge. Your knee is a natural hinge joint; your hip can move in different directions, but when you’re wearing an exoskeleton, it only assists you in forward and backward motion—hip extension and flexion, to put it in terms a physical therapist or fitness trainer would recognize. Hip-based exoskeletons assist your glutes in straightening your hip and/or assist your hip flexors in raising your leg in front of you.\n\nAscentiz wisely set up its booth at the edge of the show floor, near a set of steps and also near a not-too-crowded area where I could walk and jog. The exoskeleton helped me climb stairs, and then I took it back and forth for a couple of jogs and even attempted a sprint. It felt smooth and my movements felt natural, with the power assisting me at just the right time during each stride.\n\nAscentiz is currently running a Kickstarter for funding, and lists prices on its website. The H1 (hip) module is going for $699 to $999, and will have a suggested retail price of $1,499 to $1,999 depending on whether you go for the “Pro” or “Ultra” model. The knee module (K1) covers both knees and costs about $100 more. The full set, with both hip and knee assistance, will sell for $2,499 to $3,399.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I borrowed my CNET colleague James Bricknell’s Hypershell X Ultra unit for a quick spin around the conference halls. I was impressed at how much its “beast mode” helped me do step-ups onto a chair, so then I decided to see if it could help me jog…and then run…and then sprint. And then attempt some quick turns and stops to see if it could keep up. (This was the first hip-based exoskeleton I tried to run in.)\n\nTo my surprise, it felt great. To be fair, the Ascentiz felt pretty good to run in, too. I didn’t have space to run in the Sumbu one. The Hypershell kept up with my movements and assisted seamlessly. The others would sometimes think I was taking a step when I was actually standing still; the Hypershell wasn’t as prone to these missteps.\n\nUnlike some of the other exoskeletons on this list, the Hypershell is already on the market, and that’s probably why its technology feels a bit more mature. (It claims to be the first consumer outdoor exoskeleton.) The Hypershell X Ultra goes for $1,999 and the company’s lowest-price model is the Hypershell Go, at $899.\n\nI found the Skip booth in the AARP’s AgeTech Collaborative section. There, I tried a version of its Mo/Go exoskeleton, which is built into a pair of pants and operates at the knee. The pants hide leg cuffs, which feel a bit like a medical knee brace. The motorized unit snaps onto the outside of the pants, so it looks like you’re wearing normal hiking pants but with a robot’s joint at the side of your knee.\n\nI had to change out of my jeans and into the special pants, and then I could snap on the motor and start climbing stairs and squatting. The feeling is different than on the hip exoskeletons, as you might imagine. The motor essentially acts as an extra quad muscle, helping to straighten my knee, and slowing me down as I’m descending stairs.\n\nI went up and down the stairs. I did some squats in place. I sat down on a low seat and stood back up again. Having been through knee pain and knee surgery in the past, I instantly understood why this product would be in demand (and why it was one of AARP’s picks). The other exoskeletons try to decelerate you on the way down stairs, but this one really works. Sitting down, the robot knees helped me gently settle, rather than having that “plop” at the end of the motion that we all probably do without thinking about it.\n\nI only ran a few steps, but the running didn’t feel great—you can tell it’s not meant for that motion, at least not yet. I didn’t find these as comfortable as the other exoskeletons I tried, because the cuffs were inside the pants. That meant I had them contacting my bare skin, where they got sweaty and seemed like they might chafe. It also wasn’t particularly easy to get the pants on—if I had mobility issues, I’d probably want help with that. The Skip representative mentioned that the exoskeleton can be removed from the pants and worn without them, which is probably what I’d do if I owned a pair.\n\nSkip’s Mo/Go isn’t available yet, but you can place a pre-order on the device now, which will eventually cost $4,999.\n\nThis was both the first and nearly the last exoskeleton I tried at CES. I took it for a quick spin at Unveiled and visited the booth in Eureka Park for a longer try-on later in the week.\n\nDephy calls its exoskeleton “powered footwear.” The Sidekick has two parts: a shoe with a carbon plate, and a robotic arm that hugs your shin just below the knee. Dephy worked with Nike, and both companies came up with their own version of the exoskeleton; you can see Nike’s version here, branded as “Project Amplify.”\n\nThe shoes can be worn on their own, and they’re cushy—I kept hearing people compare them to Hokas. They were certainly more comfortable than my own beat-up Nikes that I was wearing to get around the show halls. There’s a connector on the back, and the robotic arm hooks into it. If the arm were to detach while you’re wearing it, it would fall behind you, rather than in front.\n\nThe Dephy Sidekick assists your calf muscles in helping you walk. They don’t start to assist until you’ve walked several steps, but then I felt them lift my heel on every step. The device doesn’t help you lift your foot, but it does help you to flex your foot downward, pushing you forward as you walk. Dephy says it targeted this movement since the calf muscles are “unsung heroes” of walking, providing most of the energy.\n\nI took a few steps at Unveiled, and even did a sprint through the crowd. Running felt weird, but not necessarily bad. Later, taking a longer walk through Eureka Park, I could definitely believe that Dephy’s ankle-based exoskeleton would save me more work and fatigue than the hip-based models I mentioned earlier.\n\nOverall this design felt the best thought-out and most comfortable of all the exoskeletons I tried. The places where it attached to my body were the shoe and a pad on the front of my shin—both very comfortable, and easily worn over my normal socks and pants. The device hooks on quickly, and the battery packs slip in and out without any fuss.\n\nI worried about the quick motion of the motor pulling me (or, hypothetically, an older person with mobility issues) off balance, but the way the device is programmed, that seems a lot less likely than I assumed. The motor only kicks in while you’re walking forward, and stops assisting when it detects a sideways, backward, or otherwise unexpected step. At one point I dodged around somebody’s dog in a cramped corner of the show floor, and the Sidekick stopped assisting for those few steps, then went right back to helping me move forward.\n\nThe Sidekick starts shipping later this month, and the starter pack, including the shoes, batteries, and a charger, costs $4,500.\n\nBefore I can say that exoskeletons are useful in the real world, I’d have to know that they work, that they’re worth the cost, and that they make sense for the people who are most likely to want them.\n\nTrying them on convinced me that they do, in fact, work. Five out of six (sorry, WiRobotics) gave assistance that felt helpful and useful. I wasn’t sure that they’d pass even this low bar, so I’m already impressed.\n\nCost is a problem, though. Who is going to spend $1,000 to $5,000 for a little assistance in walking or hiking? Serious hikers and runners would probably rather train harder to handle tough terrain and spend the money on gear or coaching. People who don’t normally hike might enjoy keeping up with their friends, but what non-hiker is going to spend that kind of money on a hiking exoskeleton?\n\nI could definitely see exoskeletons in a rental market—borrow a Hypershell unit to hike up a scenic mountain on vacation, or wear Dephy’s powered footwear to stay on your feet longer in a theme park (remembering that you’d need to swap out the batteries once or twice during the day).\n\nAfter trying the devices and frowning at the cost, my biggest question was whether exoskeletons could be useful for people with mobility issues due to disability or chronic health conditions. And to get a better sense of that, I talked to someone who has been working with exoskeletons in a medical setting for years.\n\nAmanda Clark, director of Good Shepherd Creates, is a physical therapist by training. Good Shepherd is a rehabilitation network that has been using exoskeletons in physical therapy for over 10 years, including the Ekso Bionics robotic suit used for physical therapy sessions, the Trexo Plus for children, and the ReWalk personal device that people can take home.\n\nThese exoskeletons can help people to walk who may not have been able to walk on their own before, or who are recovering from strokes or brain or spinal cord injuries. The more steps you get in, the better your nervous system gets at learning how to balance and walk.\n\nClark told me that the models that are used in rehab may cost a facility around $250,000, plus another 10% of that per year for maintenance. Typically a person needs a device like a walker or crutches to use them, and must have a person assisting them—such as a physical therapist at a rehab facility, or a family member in the case of the few personal exoskeletons that are now on the medical market.\n\nGetting an exoskeleton approved as a medical device takes a lot of time and money for the manufacturer, Clark explained. Medical devices need to undergo a type of FDA approval similar to that for drugs. The manufacturer has to show that they use good manufacturing processes, and they have to run clinical trials showing that the device is safe, and then that it is effective for a specific medical condition.\n\nThat explains why the company reps I talked to were very careful to say that they made a “consumer” or “recreational” or “athletic” device, and not a medical device. But consumer devices can’t usually be covered by insurance, which puts a pretty big barrier in the way of access. People with disabilities and chronic conditions—especially if they have trouble working—usually don’t have a thousands of dollars to drop on devices like these.\n\nWith the particular models I saw being so new, if I were in that position, I’d also be nervous about whether the devices work as promised, whether they’re safe, and whether the company would stay in business over the years to provide support in case anything goes wrong.\n\nBut as a technology with room to grow, there’s definitely a possibility that these devices could become useful and worthwhile for people with mobility issues. Clark said she’s happy to see the technological progress that has been made to get these devices small and light enough to be wearable outside the clinic.\n\nStill, she sees cost as a major barrier. “My challenge to these companies is: how do you create something that is user friendly, that is slim profile, that could really promote these changes in independence and quality of life—but at a price point or in a way that is accessible to them?”\n\nThat’s where I land as well. The technology is promising, but at the current price point, I’m not sure that they’re accessible to enough people with mobility issues, or worthwhile enough for athletes. But since the devices I tried are new to the consumer market, I’m looking forward to seeing if there are improvements in price and technology in the years to come.",

    "description": "Verizon has acknowledged a nationwide outage.",
    "fullText": "If you're a Verizon customer who's noticed your phone shifting into SOS mode throughout the day, there's now an official explanation: As confirmed by Verizon itself, the carrier has been facing a nationwide outage throughout the afternoon.\n\n\"We are aware of an issue impacting wireless voice and data services for some customers,\" Verizon said to Lifehacker sister site Mashable. \"Our engineers are engaged and are working to identify and solve the issue quickly. We understand how important reliable connectivity is and apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\nThe company also posted an acknowledgement over on X, while on popular service interruption tracking website Downdetector (which is owned by the same parent company as Lifehacker), user reports of problems have been coming in steadily since about noon. They reached a peak of over 170,000 reports at around 12:50 EST, and while they've dropped steadily since then, the latest update at time of writing still saw over 60,000 reports of problems.\n\nI'm a Verizon customer, but my phone seems to be unaffected for now, even if I turn my wifi off and rely purely on my cell signal. That's a bit surprising, as according to Downdetector, the areas with the most reports include both New York City (likely meaning Manhattan) and Brooklyn, which would include where I'm located. Other areas reporting major disruptions include Charlotte, N.C.; Houston; Atlanta; Dallas; Philadelphia; Miami; and Ashburn, Va.\n\nAs for which services are impacted, 61% of reports only point out mobile phone problems in general, but 35% of reports specifically complain about a lack of signal, while 4% report issues with mobile internet.\n\nYou'll know if you're affected if your signal strength is low, which is usually indicated by four vertical bars in the top-right corner of your phone. Your phone might also display that it's in \"SOS\" Mode. This does not mean that you or your phone are in any danger, but rather, that signal is only present for contacting emergency services like 911.\n\nUnfortunately, the best you can do while the outage is resolved is probably wait, although if you're connected to wifi and are still having issues calling or texting, you could try an alternative messaging app like WhatsApp, as well as ensure that wifi calling is enabled on your phone. The loss of cell service should mostly affect those relying on data from cell towers, rather than those connected to an internet router.\n\nWhile Verizon is facing the brunt of user reports, T-Mobile and AT&T are also seeing their own share of outage complaints over on Downdetector. Some of these may be a case of confusion, however. On X, T-Mobile said that its network \"is operating normally and as expected,\" but that some customers may still face issues, specifically if they're trying to reach someone on a Verizon plan. AT&T posted similar sentiments, albeit with a more aggressive tone.\n\nMeanwhile, city governments are issuing their own warnings. An emergency AlertDC notification sent to Washington D.C. residents said, \"If you have an emergency and can not connect using your Verizon Wireless device, please connect using a device from another carrier, a landline, or go to a police district or fire station to report the emergency.\"\n\nWhile the city's advice is understandable, as it wants to prepare readers for a worst possible scenario, it's worth reiterating that, for emergency calls, phones can use any viable nearby network. If you are a Verizon customer and you need immediate help from 911, it's still best to attempt reaching out over the phone (or even text, depending on your area) before taking the extra time to visit emergency services in person. As a reminder, connecting to wifi and enabling wifi calling can help with this.\n\nAs for New York, it's taking a more measured approach with its messaging. New York City's Office of Emergency Management posted to X that it is aware of the outage and that the government is \"working closely with our partners\" to asses possible impacts.",

    "title": "Most Bizarre Military Vehicles That Made History",
    "description": "Military history is full of bizarre engineering born of desperation. These \"fever dream\" machines challenged physics to solve the impossible problems of war.",
    "fullText": "Military history is filled with sleek fighters, massive tanks, and iconic weapons, but scattered among them are machines so bizarre they look like they were designed during a fever dream after binge-watching too many sci-fi movies. Some were prototypes that never made it past testing but still flew, rolled, or fired in real life, proving that just because you can build something doesn't mean you should.\n\nOthers were actually put into full service, where their strange shapes and awkward designs became unlikely heroes of war. These weren't the most polished, but rather eccentric solutions born of necessity, wild ambition, or the kind of desperation that makes you think \"what if we just duct-tape a howitzer to this truck chassis?\"\n\nFrom tanks that resembled mobile barns to flying boats that seemed half-alien, each one demonstrates how engineers sometimes disregard physics textbooks to see what happens.\n\nWe didn’t simply pick vehicles that looked odd (although that's quite fascinating in its own right). Our ranking was based on three factors:\n\nHow unusual their concept or design was\n\nWhether they worked in practice\n\nTo capture the full spectrum of strangeness, we split the list into two parts. The first half covers vehicles that were experimental or never saw true combat, but were still real machines that left the drawing board and proved themselves in tests. The second half highlights the bizarre vehicles that actually went into service or saw combat, showing that weirdness didn’t stop at the prototype stage.\n\nOur goal wasn’t to judge them on technical specs or battlefield performance, but on how boldly and bizarrely they challenged conventional design. In the end, each machine earned its spot by being both strange and real, either as a functioning oddity or as a combat-tested curiosity.\n\nNot every wild idea made it to the battlefield, but that didn't stop engineers from building and testing them anyway. These machines were strange, ambitious, and often about as practical as a screen door on a submarine; yet they were real, and they proved that even the craziest concepts could take shape in steel and wings.\n\nSpecs: 183 mm L4A1 gun, Centurion-based chassis, about 50.8 tonnes combat weight; very tall, lightly armored turret\n\nAt first glance, the FV4005 Stage II looked like someone had welded a garden shed onto a tank chassis and declared it battle-ready. This wasn't subtle engineering: this was the British saying, \"if bigger guns win wars, let's build the biggest bloody gun we can fit on tracks.\"\n\nThe turret was so absurdly tall and thin that crews nicknamed it \"The Barn,\" and honestly, most barns probably had better structural integrity. The tank was so top-heavy that firing the main gun required lowering a rear recoil spade into the ground, essentially turning it into a temporary artillery piece.In trials, recoil could noticeably lift the front of the vehicle (reported on the order of a few dozen centimeters at some elevations); which is either impressive engineering or a fantastic way to launch your tank crew into orbit. Maybe both.\n\nThe 183mm gun could theoretically penetrate any Soviet armor at ridiculous ranges, but good luck getting there without tipping over. Tank crews took one look at this mechanical giraffe and probably started updating their wills. Though it never entered service, it remains a favorite among tank enthusiasts who appreciate the pure audacity of strapping a ship's cannon to a tank and hoping for the best.\n\nSpecs: Allison YT40-A-14 turboprop, 5,850 hp, a tailsitter VTOL concept (intended to take off and land vertically, but it never demonstrated operational vertical takeoffs/landings in testing), maximum pucker factor\n\nThe Lockheed XFV was probably the result of someone asking, \"What if we made a plane that lands like a rocket?\" and nobody had the sense to say, \"That sounds terrible.\" This tail-sitting fighter looked like a conventional plane that had been stood on its tail by a very confused ground crew.\n\nThe idea was brilliant in theory: vertical takeoff meant no runways were needed, making it perfect for carriers or forward bases. In practice, it meant asking test pilots to land while looking over their shoulder at the ground rushing up to meet them. The landing gear looked like something stolen from a NASA launch pad, because conventional gear would have snapped like toothpicks.\n\nTest pilot Herman \"Fish\" Salmon (yes, that was his real name) described flying it as \"interesting,\" which in test pilot speak translates to \"holy heck, I can't believe I survived that.\" The XFV flew conventionally using temporary landing gear and conducted limited testing related to the VTOL concept, but it did not prove routine vertical takeoff-and-landing operations, and likely give any pilot who flew it nightmares for weeks.\n\nThe program was scrapped when everyone realized that asking pilots to thread the needle of a vertical landing while enemy fire was incoming might not be the best career move. The XFV proved that sometimes the laws of physics and human psychology should take precedence over engineering ambition.\n\nSpecs: Two Soloviev D-30 turbofans, inflatable pontoons, maximum weirdness coefficient achieved\n\nThe VVA-14 looked like what you'd get if a submarine, a seaplane, and a hovercraft had a three-way collision and decided to make the best of it. Soviet engineers were tasked with building an anti-submarine aircraft that could operate from water, and apparently decided that conventional design principles were for capitalists.\n\nThis flying doorstop featured inflatable pontoons that resembled giant water wings, stubby wings that seemed too small to keep a paper airplane aloft, and a fuselage that appeared to have been designed with a ruler and little imagination. The whole thing looked as if it were perpetually surprised to be airborne.\n\nThe VVA-14 was supposed to hunt NATO submarines using ground effect, basically flying so close to the water that it could barely clear the waves. Watching it take off was like seeing a concrete mixer attempt flight. Soviet test crews reported it handled \"adequately,\" which is probably the most damning praise ever recorded in aviation history.\n\nDespite looking like a flying mistake, it actually worked. The program stalled largely because the intended lift-engine set (for VTOL/ground-effect ambitions) was never delivered, and after Bartini’s death the project lost momentum. The VVA-14 remains proof that Soviet engineers could make literally anything fly if they were given enough vodka and state funding.\n\nSpecs: Standard Meteor F8 airframe, pilot lying face-down, ergonomics designed by sadists\n\nSomeone at Gloster Aircraft looked at the perfectly functional Meteor fighter and thought, \"You know what this needs? The pilot should be lying on their stomach like they're getting a massage.\" The theory was that prone positioning would help pilots better handle high G-forces. The reality was more like asking fighter pilots to dogfight while planking.\n\nThe modified cockpit looked like a medieval torture device with windows. Test pilots had to operate all controls while lying flat, which meant reaching forward for everything and craning their necks to see where they were going. Photos of the test setup resemble someone trying to cram a grown man into a torpedo tube.\n\nRAF test pilot Eric George Franklin flew the prone-pilot Meteor during evaluation flights; the concept proved impractical for operational use. Coming from a guy who test-flew captured German jets and lived to tell about it, that's practically a death sentence for any aircraft design.\n\nThe program was quickly abandoned when everyone realized that asking pilots to fly combat missions while doing permanent push-ups wasn't exactly conducive to air superiority. The Prone Pilot Meteor remains a testament to the fact that just because you can redesign something doesn't mean you should.\n\nSpecs: Forward-swept wings, fly-by-wire flight controls, maximum instability by design\n\nThe X-29 resembled a fighter jet assembled from a kit without consulting the instructions first. Its forward-swept wings made it appear to be flying backwards even when sitting still, defying every basic principle of aircraft design that had worked perfectly well since the Wright Brothers.\n\nThis wasn't an accident, the forward-swept design was intentional, designed to improve maneuverability and reduce drag. The problem was that forward-swept wings want to twist themselves off the aircraft at high speeds, which is generally considered poor form in aviation circles. The X-29 used a triply redundant digital fly-by-wire flight-control system (with additional backup), because the airframe was intentionally unstable to operate constantly, just to prevent it from tearing itself apart in flight.\n\nNASA test pilots reported that the X-29 was incredibly agile but required the reflexes of a caffeinated mongoose to fly safely. The computer systems made about 40 flight-control corrections per second, because apparently the X-29's natural inclination was to immediately flip upside down and head for the nearest patch of ground.\n\nDespite looking completely wrong, the X-29 proved several important points about advanced aerodynamics and flight control systems. It also proved that American engineers could make anything fly if they were given enough computers and test pilots with nerves of steel.\n\nSome bizarre vehicles didn't stay as experiments: they actually rolled, floated, or flew into service. Awkward, odd, or downright laughable, these machines still managed to make their mark in real battles and operations, proving that sometimes weird just works.\n\nSpecs: 800mm gun, 1,350-ton weight, required an enormous support effort, on the order of thousands for transport, assembly, security, and rail work, while the firing crew itself was far smaller (often cited around 500), subtlety rating: zero\n\nThe Schwerer Gustav is what happened when German engineers were asked to build the biggest possible gun and forgot to ask, \"Why?\" or \"Is this necessary?\" This railway cannon was so absurdly oversized that it looked like someone had confused the blueprints for a battleship turret with those for a mobile artillery piece.\n\nEach shell weighed as much as a small car and could designed for extreme bunker-busting, often described in terms of several meters of reinforced concrete or around a meter of armor plate, depending on the shell. The gun itself required its own railway infrastructure, complete with curved tracks to handle the recoil. Moving Gustav required a logistics operation that would make Amazon's shipping department envious.\n\nThe entire setup looked like a mobile steel mountain. German artillery crews likely felt as though they were operating a mechanical volcano rather than a weapon. Gustav fired 47 rounds during the Sevastopol siege, where each shot cost roughly as much as a small fighter aircraft.\n\nDespite its impracticality, Gustav did exactly what it was designed to do: it obliterated anything it aimed at with the subtlety of a nuclear weapon and twice the engineering complexity. It remains the largest gun ever used in combat and possibly the most expensive way to deliver explosives ever invented.\n\nNecessary? I guess not. Worth it? Yes.\n\nSpecs: 6x6 amphibious capability, 2.5-ton payload, looked ridiculous, worked perfectly\n\nThe DUKW (pronounced \"Duck\") looked like what would happen if a truck and a boat had an awkward one-night stand and decided to make it work for the kids. This amphibious vehicle was essentially a standard GMC truck that had been taught to swim, with results that were both ungainly and brilliant.\n\nOn land, it looked like a boat with delusions of grandeur. In water, it looked like a truck having an identity crisis. The DUKW could carry supplies from ship to shore without needing docks, piers, or any infrastructure beyond a beach capable of supporting its weight.\n\nMilitary mechanics quickly learned to appreciate the Duck despite its unusual appearance. It could haul ammunition across rivers, deliver supplies to isolated units, and even serve as an impromptu ferry for troops. The DUKW became the Swiss Army knife of amphibious warfare, ugly, versatile, and absolutely indispensable.\n\nFrom Normandy beaches to Pacific atolls, the Duck waddled its way through every major amphibious operation of WWII. Soldiers might have laughed at it initially, but they learned to appreciate anything that could bring hot food and dry ammunition to the front lines. The DUKW proved that sometimes the best military vehicles are those that appear to have been designed by committee and built by optimists.\n\nSpecs: Half motorcycle, half tank, all weird, Opel 4-cylinder engine producing about 36 hp (26 kW), maximum confusion factor\n\nThe Kettenkrad resembled someone who had started building a motorcycle and, halfway through, decided it needed tank tracks instead of a rear wheel. German engineers deliberately created this mechanical centaur to handle terrain that would stop both motorcycles and tanks.\n\nWith handlebars like a Harley and tracks like a Panzer, the Kettenkrad could tow anti-tank guns through mud that would swallow a truck whole. German troops quickly discovered it could go places that wheeled vehicles couldn't reach and fit through spaces too small for tracked vehicles.\n\nThe steering system was a pure example of German engineering logic: the front wheel steered like a normal motorcycle at low speeds, but at higher speeds, differential braking on the tracks took over. This meant learning to drive one was like learning two completely different vehicles, depending on how fast you were going.\n\nDespite its odd appearance, Wehrmacht units loved the Kettenkrad. It could lay communication cables across rough terrain, tow equipment through forests, and even serve as a mobile command post for forward observers. German mechanics appreciated that it was reliable, serviceable, and could be repaired with standard motorcycle and tank parts.\n\nThe Kettenkrad remained in production throughout the war and was utilized in every theater where German forces were deployed. It proved that sometimes the best solution to a complex problem is to combine two working designs until something useful emerges.\n\nSpecs: Standard lorry chassis, roughly 6 inches (about 150 mm) of concrete armor (typically with reinforcement), mobility rating: \"eventually\"\n\nThe Bison wasn't sophisticated military engineering: it was what happened when Britain faced invasion and someone said, \"Let's pour concrete on trucks and see what happens.\" Built during the darkest days of 1940, these improvised armored vehicles were essentially mobile pillboxes for the Home Guard.\n\nThe concept was brilliantly simple: take a standard truck, build wooden forms around it, pour in concrete mixed with steel reinforcement, and voila, instant armored vehicle! The results looked like construction equipment that had gotten lost on the way to a building site and decided to join the army instead.\n\nThese concrete-clad lorries were slow, heavy, and about as maneuverable as their name suggests. British crews joked that the Bison could stop rifle bullets but not much else... Including hills, mud, or sharp turns. The weight of the concrete armor stressed every component of the truck chassis beyond its design limits.\n\nDespite their limitations, Bisons were deployed to guard airfields, coastal installations, and key infrastructure across Britain. Home Guard units appreciated having something that offered protection from small arms fire, even if it looked like a cement mixer with delusions of grandeur.\n\nThe Bison represented the spirit of British improvisation during WWII: it wasn't elegant, it wasn't sophisticated, but it was available, and it could stop a bullet.\n\nSpecs: Ground effect vehicle, 8 Kuznetsov NK-87 turbofans, about 340 mph (≈550 km/h) maximum cruising speed for the Lun-class, physics-defying capabilities\n\nThe ekranoplane resembled what would happen if a jumbo jet and a naval destroyer had a baby and were raised on a steady diet of rocket fuel and Soviet ambition. This ground-effect vehicle was designed to skim just above the water's surface at incredible speeds, utilizing aerodynamic principles that most Western engineers considered theoretically interesting but practically insane.\n\nThe Lun-class was essentially a flying missile boat, equipped with six Moskit anti-ship missiles and enough turbofan engines to power a small airline. It could cruise at 380 mph just 10 feet above the waves, making it nearly impossible to detect on radar until it was too late.\n\nSoviet naval aviation crews described flying the ekranoplane as surreal, traveling at jet speeds while close enough to the water to see fish swimming below. The ground effect allowed it to carry massive payloads that would be impossible for conventional aircraft, but required perfect weather conditions and calm seas to operate safely.\n\nWestern intelligence agencies were baffled by early satellite photos of the ekranoplane. It was too big to be a conventional aircraft but clearly capable of flight, leading to speculation about everything from captured alien technology to secret nuclear programs. The reality was somehow even stranger than the rumors.\n\nThe Lun entered limited service with the Soviet Navy in the late 1980s but proved too specialized for practical deployment. It required specially trained crews, perfect weather conditions, and extensive support infrastructure. The project was abandoned after the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving the remaining ekranoplanes as monuments to the fact that Soviet engineers could make anything fly if you gave them enough engines and a creative interpretation of physics.\n\nSpecs: 45 tons, 5 turrets, ypically a 10-man crew (some sources cite higher numbers depending on variant or counting attached personnel), maximum chaos potential\n\nThe T-35 was the result of Soviet tank designers being asked to build a heavy tank, and they decided that if one turret was good, five turrets must be five times better. This mechanical monster bristled with weapons in every direction, looking like someone had taken a naval destroyer and taught it to drive on land.\n\nWith one main turret mounting a 76mm gun and four smaller turrets sporting 45mm guns and machine guns, the T-35 could theoretically engage multiple targets simultaneously. In practice, coordinating fire from five different turrets while moving across rough terrain proved about as practical as conducting an orchestra during an earthquake.\n\nThe T-35 was a crowd-pleaser at Red Square parades, where its imposing size and multiple turrets made it look unstoppable. Soviet propaganda films loved showing these mechanical fortresses rolling past the Kremlin, symbolizing the industrial might of the socialist state.\n\nCombat proved less impressive than parades. Several T-35s were deployed during the German invasion of 1941, where they were eventually knocked out or abandoned due to mechanical failures. Crews who operated them reported that coordinating five different weapons systems while under fire required skills that no amount of training could provide.\n\nThe T-35's greatest weakness wasn't enemy fire... It was its own complexity. With 11 crew members spread across five turrets, communication became a nightmare during combat. The tank was also mechanically unreliable, with a transmission that regularly failed under the strain of moving 45 tons of steel across rough terrain.\n\nDespite its poor combat record, the T-35 remains unforgettable for its sheer audacity. Soviet tank designers took the concept of \"more is better\" to its logical extreme, creating something that looked like it could conquer Europe single-handedly. The reality was more mundane, but the T-35's unique silhouette earned it a permanent place in military history.\n\nFrom prototypes that resembled designs by aliens to combat vehicles that actually made it to the battlefield despite appearing completely wrong, these machines remind us that military engineering has always walked the fine line between genius and madness.\n\nEngineers were often tasked with solving seemingly impossible problems with limited resources and boundless imagination. Sometimes the answers came in shapes that defied common sense and challenged every design principle ever written. The results were vehicles that might not have been beautiful, practical, or even particularly effective, but they worked well enough to earn their place in history.\n\nWhat unites all these mechanical oddities is their willingness to challenge convention. These weren't incremental improvements on existing designs, they were bold leaps into uncharted territory, powered by caffeine, determination, and the kind of engineering confidence that comes from never having been told something is impossible.\n\nSome never went beyond testing, while others waddled, crawled, or flew their way into real combat. However, they all demonstrate that the line between brilliant innovation and spectacular failure is often thinner than the blueprints on which they were drawn. And sometimes, the weirdest ideas are the ones that teach us the most about what's actually possible when you stop worrying about what things are supposed to look like.",

    "fullText": "Musk attempts to recast AI tool’s misuse. Plus, tech billionaires plot against a proposed California tax on their fortunes\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, US tech editor for the Guardian. Today, we discuss Elon Musk’s rosy depiction of Grok’s image generation controversy; the seven-figure panic among Silicon Valley billionaires over a proposed wealth tax in California, though with one notable exception; and how AI and robotics have revitalized the Consumer Electronics Showcase.\n\nThe firestorm over the Grok AI tool has been raging for more than a week now, and it shows no signs of dying down.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the rising backlash against Elon Musk’s Grok AI tool, which in recent weeks has allowed users to generate thousands of sexualized images of women. Some of the images show real women, some are fake, some are nonconsensual, and some depict children, all in “minimal clothing”, as the AI tool itself described them.\n\nX and its parent company, xAI, have taken some measures to curb the flood. The social network shut off its image generation feature for users who do not pay, which constitute the majority of X’s users.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Musk has obstinately recast the AI tool’s problems as everything but what they really are. He’s been promoting its popularity as if it were a piece of productivity software. He crows about its download numbers with dubious claims. On 10 January; he celebrated Grok reaching the top spot in New Zealand’s version of Apple’s App Store. (Rankings by the analytics firm SimilarWeb of the most-downloaded apps in New Zealand, which were updated the same day as Musk’s tweet, put Grok in 14th place.) The same day, he reposted a tweet about Grok reaching the No 1 spot in Thailand’s Apple App Store. (SimilarWeb’s rankings do not show Grok in the top 50 most-downloaded apps in the country.) On 9 January, he retweeted a post about Google searches for Grok spiking. (I would guess the increase in searches is evidence of great interest in the AI tool’s scandal more so than interest in using it.)\n\nIn response to the UK’s threats to ban the AI tool, he accused the country’s government of stifling free speech. After watchdogs cited instances of Grok undressing minors, he said: “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” handing the responsibility to moderate his social network to law enforcement and courts. “Illegal” is in a court’s hands and frees him from moderating all but the most heinous content.\n\nPerhaps to Musk, all press is good press? He may be right: his AI tool seems likely to accrue more users and few penalties as a result of the flood of nearly naked images.\n\nGrok has faced some repercussions: the UK’s communications regulator, Ofcom, has launched an investigation into xAI and Grok, and possible punishments could include a total ban. The Internet Watch Foundation, also based in the UK, announced it had found instances of child sexual abuse material generated by Grok in Dark Web forums. X’s revenue in the UK has plummeted by 60% as concerns over content moderation and brand safety grow. Both Indonesia and Malaysia have limited access to the AI tool in response.\n\nBut missing from the chorus decrying Grok are the two de facto smartphone regulators of smartphone software, Apple and Google, operators of the world’s biggest mobile app stores. Neither has indicated whether the Grok’s output violates their app stores’ terms of service. In the US, there’s been little backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nThe lesson for Musk and other tech leaders seems apparent: the fewer restrictions you place on AI, the more shocking content you allow it to generate, the greater your engagement and your profit.\n\nTech’s billionaires are plotting against a proposed tax on their fortunes that may appear on ballots across California in November.\n\nVenture capitalist and antichrist evangelist Peter Thiel has already made a $3m donation to fight the proposal, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the state. Other billionaires have started an encrypted group chat on Signal to strategize against it, which includes Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar” David Sacks, according to the Wall Street Journal. It’s called “Save California”. My colleague Dara Kerr reports on the division among billionaires:\n\nUnder a tax proposal that could be put to voters this November, any California resident worth more than $1bn would have to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state.\n\nSeveral Silicon Valley figures have already threatened to leave California and take their business elsewhere. But Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, whose net worth is nearly $159bn, told Bloomberg Television this week that he is “perfectly fine with it”.\n\nThis puts Huang in stark contrast with the Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, the venture capitalist David Sacks, all of whom have recently indicated they are leaving California for tax-friendlier states including Florida and Texas.\n\nUnder the proposed tax, Huang would pay roughly $7bn, and Page and Brin would pay one-time amounts of about $13bn and $12bn, respectively, based on their current net worth of $264bn and $243bn. Thiel would pay $1.3bn, based on his current net worth of $26bn.\n\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, held annually in Las Vegas for decades since its start in 1967, made global news this year. Nvidia and AMD chose it as the forum for major announcements on new hardware and software. Samsung announced a double folding phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, and Lego debuted a “smart brick” that seems quite fun as well. Robots abounded, rechristened as “physical AI”.\n\nIt’s been quite the turnaround for CES. For much of the 2010s, hardware announcements rarely made for top headlines. New DVD players or TVs did not make a splash. Smartphones dominated, and they all looked extremely similar. Apple, the most valuable company in the world at the end of the decade, even skipped it entirely. Now, however, Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world, and it chose CES to present what’s next. Artificial intelligence and robotics have breathed new life into CES. The themes and innovations that define the convention are broader and affect more industries outside tech than they once did.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I predicted that consumer technology would take many strange new shapes in the coming year, which seems to already be true as we view new developments in robotics. Humanoid robots debuted at CES, including one from Hyundai and Boston Dynamics. My colleague Samuel Gibbs dubbed a laundry-folding robot one of the best things about the convention.\n\nMeta blocked nearly 550,000 accounts in first days of Australia’s under-16s social media ban\n\nIran’s internet shutdown is chillingly precise and may last some time\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet hits $4tn valuation after AI deal with Apple\n\n‘Dangerous and alarming’: Google removes some of its AI summaries after users’ health put at risk",

Soil conditions at the find offered little in the way of preservation, instead leaving what Len Middleton, an Oxford Cotswold Archaeology project officer, referred to in a statement as “striking sand silhouettes that capture the outlines of bodies in remarkable detail.”\n\nDated to the sixth and seventh centuries, the finds were unearthed during the preparation for a new Sizewell Link Road. Nigel Cann, chief executive officer of Sizewell C, said that uncovering the burial ground offers a “fascinating glimpse into Suffolk’s rich heritage and the lives of its early communities.”\n\nThose involved in the excavations said that the work reveals more about England’s past. “Discoveries like this are of national importance because they deepen our understanding of power, belief, and identity in early medieval England,” said Middleton, “and how those idea were expressed along the East Anglian coast.”\n\nThe new find isn’t the first in the Sizewell C area, which has already seen the uncovering of a well-preserved pottery kiln, a rare Iron Age oak ladder, a Bronze Age cremation urn, and even a site featuring stone tools, pottery, and the remnants of an early Neolithic building that is likely from around 3500 B.C.E.\n\nAnother location offered up a hoard of over 300 11th century silver coins encased in lead and cloth. The hoard was believed to have been a savings pot buried by a local as a precaution during either social or political unrest in the 11th century. It has since been donated to the Suffolk County Council’s Archaeological Service.\n\nRosanna Price, engagement manager at Cotswold Archaeology, said that the excavations have revealed an “astonishing 36,000 years of human occupation—from the early wandering of Neanderthals to the graft of the first farmers 6,000 years ago, and from the rich culture of early medieval England to the tough training grounds of the Second World War.”\n\nSizewell C currently features roughly 770,000 square miles of excavation ground spread across 70 sites. “Suffolk continues to reveal its stunning past,” Debbie Richard, Suffolk County Council’s deputy cabinet member for Archaeology and Landscape Partnerships, said in a statement, “and the magnitude of these discoveries should not be under-estimated.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "For Mohamed Salah, it was a familiar feeling of anguish on the international stage.\n\nThe Liverpool forward looked on in dismay and disbelief as the referee's whistle sounded at the Grand Stade de Tangier on Wednesday night and consigned Egypt to a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Senegal in the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations semi-final.\n\nIn a stale and largely uneventful affair in Morocco, it was Sadio Mane's thumping effort 12 minutes from time that was enough to secure Senegal's place in Sunday's final.\n\nThis was not in the script for Salah nor Egypt, who arrived in Morocco last month openly targeting a first Afcon title since 2010.\n\nSpeaking to BBC World Service after the game, Mane said of his former Liverpool team-mate: \"It is not easy for him - but still best of luck.\n\n\"He did everything to carry his team until now. Unfortunately one of us had to [lose]. I'm happy [to be] in the final.\"\n\nFor Salah, the sight of Mane - with whom he reportedly had an indifferent relationship with at Anfield - soaking up glory on the international stage, while he suffered hurt, has been one that has become all too familiar in recent years.\n\nIn the 2021 Afcon final, Mane - still at Liverpool with Salah - scored the decisive spot-kick to upset Egypt and clinch his nation's maiden title.\n\nA couple of months later, when the two sides met in a two-legged tie for a place at the 2022 World Cup, it was Mane again who converted the winning penalty in the shootout to seal his side's place at the Qatar showpiece after Salah had blazed his effort over the bar.\n\nNow, nearly four years on, this dispiriting loss - after a timid and uninspiring performance from his side in the last-four tie - will cut just as deep for Salah.",

    "title": "What It Means When Your Flight Attendants Are On 'Crotch Watch'",
    "description": "Flight attendants have secret code words for various parts of their job. \"Crotch watch\" may be one of the more indelicate terms, but it's very important.",
    "fullText": "Just as different professionals have their own languages when they communicate with one another, there are also code words that flight attendants use while on duty. Among such terms, the one that often surprises passengers if they hear it is \"crotch watch.\" This indelicate term is the informal name flight attendants use when they want to check whether passengers have their seatbelts correctly fastened. Before any takeoff, landing, or when turbulence is expected, flight attendants walk through the cabin and briefly scan each row. When they do this, they're checking whether your seatbelt is buckled, visible, and worn properly.\n\nThe crew call this quick scan \"crotch watch\" because, as flight attendants often tell you, a seatbelt worn correctly sits low and tight across the hips (not the belly). This task is also sometimes called a \"groin scan,\" and usually happens right after the fasten-seatbelt sign turns on. While the sign is the official instruction to passengers, airlines still prefer that flight attendants visually check for compliance. This is because they believe the ultimate safety of their passengers solely rests on their shoulders, so they won't want to take any risk. Besides that flight attendants observe so many things about you the moment you board a plane, this \"groin scan\" routine is one of the most basic and important safety checks they perform in the cabin.\n\nPutting on seatbelts isn't just a formality, it's a serious safety measure. According to aviation safety experts, turbulence is one of the most common causes of in-flight injuries, especially when passengers aren't buckled in. This is why airlines always insist that you fasten your seatbelts when it's time to takeoff, land, or during rough air — and why they encourage you to keep your seatbelt fastened, even if the flight feels smooth. Seatbelts reduce injury during sudden altitude changes.\n\nWhen flight attendants perform a crotch watch, they are confirming that your seatbelt is fastened and worn correctly, low and snug across the hips. They also prefer that it's visible, not hidden under blankets or jackets, so they can check it at a quick glance. If your belt is covered, a flight attendant may stop and instruct you to adjust it. When they do that, their aim is not to annoy you. They just want to ensure the safety rules are followed. It's a safety check passengers benefit from.\n\nSo if you notice that a flight attendant briefly glances at your lap, you don't have to feel awkward. It's simply part of their job. The best way to avoid being disturbed during this scan is to keep your seatbelt fastened appropriately whenever the sign is on. Doing this will not only help the crew do their job quickly and keep everyone safer in the air, it'll also prevent you from making a mistake that could drive the crew up the wall.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?

With the Call of Duty franchise having an off year with Black Ops 7, sports titles took the top spots in PlayStation Store's American/Canadian and European PlayStation 5 downloads.\n\nNBA 2K26 was No. 1 in America and Canada, while EA Sports FC 26 claimed the top spot in Europe. It was previously clear that Black Ops 7 would have a hard time repeating Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's chart-topping performance in 2024. But the latest Call of Duty installment fell to No. 7 in America/Canada and Europe. By contrast, Battlefield 6 performed very well in both territories, with a No. 2 finish in North America and a fifth place slot in Europe. Through the end of November 2025, Circana had Battlefield 6 as the best-selling game of the year. But this particular list is only for PlayStation Store downloads and it doesn't count sales on other consoles or PC.\n\nThe lists contained some returning favorites like Minecraft and Helldivers 2, but newcomers like Arc Raiders, Ghost of Yotei, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made the cut in North America as well.\n\nAmong PlayStation 4 games, Red Dead Redemption 2 claimed No. 1 in both territories. Rockstar Games' 2018 open-world western has remained remarkably resilient, as has Grand Theft Auto 5, which placed highly on both the PS5 and PS4 lists.\n\nBeat Saber also claimed the top slots in America/Canada and Europe's PSVR 2 Games charts, and repeated its wins from 2024. Similarly, Fortnite was also a back-to-back winner for free-to-play games in both territories.\n\nThe complete list of 2025's top games on PlayStation Store can be found below.",
