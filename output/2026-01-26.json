    "fullText": "The TCU Horned Frogs will be well represented at the 2026 Panini Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama this coming weekend. With kickoff set for less than six days, TCU sixth-year senior linebacker Namdi Obiazor has recently accepted an invitation to participate in the annual showcase game. Obiazor, who played in 53 games over four seasons, will join linebacker Kaleb Elarms-Orr, safety Bud Clark and tight end DJ Rogers in the Senior Bowl.\n\nOfficially Accepted!\n\nLB Namdi Obiazor (@namdi4k) from @TCUFootball is headed to the 2026 Panini Senior Bowl 🔥#TheDraftStartsInMobile #WherePlayersPlay pic.twitter.com/wNc4jFWWca\n\n— Panini Senior Bowl (@seniorbowl) January 25, 2026\n\nObiazor, who started his collegiate career at Iowa Western and was a JUCO All-American in 2021, played safety during his first season with the Horned Frogs. Obiazor played in all 15 games and made two starts, finishing with 49 tackles and two pass breakups. Following TCU’s 2022 season, which culminated in a trip to the national title game, Obiazor moved to linebacker and replaced Dee Winters. The change worked well for Obiazor, who earned an All-Big 12 Honorable Mention with 84 tackles, six tackles for loss, four sacks and two pass breakups in 2023.\n\nA three-year starter at TCU, Obiazor ranked second on the team with 81 tackles, third with 6.5 tackles for loss and fifth with 2.5 sacks during the 2024 season. Obiazor would’ve had to turn pro last offseason, but in light of the Diego Pavia lawsuit, which granted additional eligibility to players who started at the JUCO level, Obiazor returned to the Horned Frogs in 2025. In his final season at TCU, Obiazor posted a career-high 88 total tackles along with four tackles for loss, two sacks, two interceptions and a forced fumble. The 6-foot-3, 230-pounder from Eden Prairie, Minnesota was named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week against Colorado.\n\nThe 2026 Senior Bowl will kick off on Saturday. Jan. 31 at 1:30 p.m. Former TCU players who’ve participated in the game include Jack Bech (2025 – MVP), Emani Bailey (2024), Jared Wiley (2024), Brandon Coleman (2024), Steve Avila (2023), Derius Davis (2023), Max Duggan (2023), Dee Winters (2023) and Dylan Horton (2023).",

    "fullText": "Where should the blame go after Broncos drop AFC Championship Game to Patriots? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFollowing a difficult loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday, the Denver Broncos will be wondering how things went so badly. Broncos Country will be pointing fingers in multiple directions.\n\nThe Broncos got up 7-0 in this one and looked to be in control during most of the first half of the game. The biggest play of the game came in the second quarter, when Jarrett Stidham dropped back for a pass and, while facing a fierce New England pass rush, threw a pass with two hands to get rid of the ball.\n\nIt was originally ruled an incomplete pass with an intentional grounding penalty, but the officials quickly changed that, ruling it a backwards pass and recovery by New England. Two plays later, the Patriots scored a touchdown and were on the board, tying the game. In the second half, a grand total of three points were scored... by both teams.\n\nThere were multiple reasons for that, and all of them played a factor in how this game ended up.\n\nThe Broncos' head coach is going to get some heat for this loss due to his play-calling, but his decision to go for it on 4th-and-1 from the New England 14-yard line rather than kicking a field goal will be questioned for quite some time.\n\nIn addition to choosing against taking a chip-shot field goal and taking a 10-0 lead, the play call was poor. Jarrett Stidham dropped back to throw a quick pass to RJ Harvey. It didn't even come close to working. The Broncos turned the ball over on downs and gave away all of the momentum they had earned.\n\nIt turned out to be a critical sequence in this game.\n\nWhen looking back at this game, the majority of Broncos fans are going to put this loss on Stidham and say that with Bo Nix, the Broncos would have won. While that is quite possible, Stidham is not the reason the Broncos lost this game.\n\nTo be clear, he was far from good. But the weather in the second half (more on that later) made it all but impossible to do anything on offense. Stidham threw an interception on what ended up being the Broncos' final possession. That was easily the worst play he made in the game. But he had Courtland Sutton drop two passes and he got little help from his running game. It's hard to put this loss all on his shoulders.\n\nWhat would a loss in today's NFL be without some controversy? Fans of the Buffalo Bills have spent the past week having that discussion, and Broncos fans have some good ammunition to do the same following this game.\n\nThe backwards pass call was highly questionable.\n\nThe refs are at it again\n\nThis was called a backwards pass by Stidham. It’s clearly going forward\n\nThe Broncos just got screwed pic.twitter.com/8OljvmyAgM\n\n— Benchwarmer Sports (@bdubsports_) January 25, 2026\n\nThis was clearly a \"pass\" by Stidham and not a fumble. One angle of the replay shows the ball start to leave Stidham's hands and get deflected by a Patriots defender. What does that result in on any other play? An incomplete pass.\n\nSo in this situation, it truly does not matter where the ball lands in relation to where it was thrown. If it was deflected, it's incomplete. The Patriots go into halftime with no points if not for this play.\n\nOn the opening possession of the second half, the Patriots went for it on 4th-and-1 from the Denver 8-yard line. Drake Maye used a quarterback sneak up the middle and was down right near the line to gain. An overhead replay seemed to show that he came up short, leading to a challenge from Payton. Payton asked for the officials to look at that overhead replay.\n\nIt was extremely close either way, but the referees chose to stick with the call that was made on the field. The Broncos were able to hold to a field goal, but those ended up being the winning points for the Patriots.\n\nWhile many fans are going to passionately criticize Payton and Stidham for this defeat, the snow that began to fall at halftime ended up being the biggest factor in this game.\n\nAfter the initial drive by the Patriots, offensive football was almost non-existent. The footing was terrible for the players and vision was extremely obstructed due to the blizzard-like conditions. This game would have had a much different outcome without the snow and it's an unfortunate turn of events for the Broncos that the weather in their own stadium pretty much ended their hopes of going to the Super Bowl.\n\nFor anyone suggesting that the Patriots had to play in the same conditions, that's not entirely true. If you look at the conditions in the early third quarter compared to how it was just moments after that, it was a drastic change, which is exactly why the score of 10-7 ended up being the final score.\n\nIt was nearly impossible to produce any points once it got like that.\n\nREAD:4 things Denver Broncos must do in order to beat Patriots in AFC Championship Game\n\nThe Broncos had their chances and this was a difficult way to end what was a great season.\n\nBroncos get good news following recent move made by Packers\n\nJarrett Stidham can join exclusive list that includes multiple Hall of Famers\n\n4 under-the-radar factors for Broncos fans to watch for in AFC Championship Game\n\nBroncos' similarities between last Super Bowl appearance and this year are astonishing\n\nFormer coach hated by Broncos fans could play specific role in derailing Super Bowl plans",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are headed to Super Bowl LX after defeating the Denver Broncos by a 10-7 score in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday.\n\nDefense ruled the day in a low-scoring, messy game for both teams. It was tough to move the ball downfield for both offenses with the snow pouring from the sky at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium. The Patriots recorded only 206 total yards of offense, while the Broncos only mustered 181 total yards.\n\nThe rushing attack was a major factor for the Patriots on a day when throwing the ball in the elements proved difficult. They recorded 141 yards on the ground, including a six-yard rushing touchdown from Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.\n\nThe difference in the game ended up being the turnover the Patriots forced on Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham, who fumbled a backwards pass while being hit by linebacker Christian Elliss. That play put the Patriots in the red zone and set up the touchdown run by Maye.\n\nOverall, Maye went 10-of-21 passing for 86 yards, along with rushing 10 times for 65 yards and one touchdown. Rhamondre Stevenson had 25 carries for 71 yards to help punch New England's ticket to the Super Bowl.\n\nHere is how fans reacted on social media to the Patriots' win:\n\nWHAT ARE THEY GONA SAY NOW.

    "fullText": "Braves predicted to sign $200M World Series champion, 2X All-Star to form 'unfair' Chris Sale duo originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are usually known for having one of the top starting rotations in the league. However, after this upcoming season, the picture at the position becomes a major focus. Outside of two Braves starters, there are no pitchers currently under contract beyond that point.\n\n“Beyond Spencer Strider and Spencer Schwellenbach, there are no clear locks for the Atlanta Braves rotation beyond 2026,’” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote.\n\nThe Braves are content with the starters they have this season, but there comes a point when the future must be considered. Atlanta reportedly checked in on Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta before he was traded. Anthopoulos knows the team needs another starter, but it cannot be just anyone.\n\n“We’ve explored the starting rotation, adding and getting some type of starter, whether that’s trade or signing. We’d like for it to be someone impactful, someone we think can start a playoff game,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThere is still a name on the market that the Braves could pursue: Framber Valdez. FanSided’s Mark Powell believes Atlanta can get a deal done.\n\n“But Valdez is the best starting pitcher available after Ranger Suarez signed with the Boston Red Sox. His catcher cross-up could cost him some money on what's been a slow market for free-agent starting pitchers. That should only help a team like the Braves, which has an elite rotation (when healthy) but quite frankly needs more bodies. Adding Valdez to a group that already includes Chris Sale, Spencer Strider and Reynaldo Lopez is borderline unfair,” Powell wrote.\n\nThe Braves would benefit greatly from adding Valdez, as it would give the rotation two left-handers and create a nightmare matchup for opposing teams. Atlanta’s rotation is already strong, but this type of move could elevate it to an elite level.\n\nValdez is still chasing another World Series championship, and there may be no better opportunity than joining the team that once defeated the Houston Astros on the game’s biggest stage. Anthopoulos still has room to make another offseason addition as Spring Training approaches.",

    "description": "Here's what coach Shea Ralph said Vanderbilt women's basketball needs to learn the most from its loss to South Carolina.",
    "fullText": "For a team that was undefeated going into its matchup with South Carolina, just about everything went wrong for Vanderbilt women's basketball on Jan. 25 at Colonial Life Arena.\n\nOn offense, the No. 4 Commodores committed 20 turnovers. On defense, they allowed South Carolina to shoot 62% from the field (40-for-65).\n\nDuring one sequence at the beginning of the third quarter, they cut their deficit to seven, but they missed a few layups and from there, the No. 2 Gamecocks took control.\n\n\"As crappy as we played today for a lot of that game, especially in the second quarter, in the beginning of the third we were in it,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph said. \"We can never let the wind go out of our sails. We can never lay down and die. And I think for me, that was what was most disappointing and embarrassing. We just didn't play like ourselves, and at points in the game, it was like we quit.\"\n\nRalph did compliment Mikayla Blakes on her hustle, as the star sophomore put up 23 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals.\n\nThe most disappointing element to Ralph, though, was Vanderbilt's defense. Though some of the issue was the Commodores (20-1, 6-1 SEC) allowing 32 points off their 20 turnovers, the Gamecocks (20-2, 6-1) had 10 made 3's, shooting 59%.\n\n\"Our defense, was bad today, awful,\" Ralph said. \"We can score, we'll be fine. We scored 74 points. We turned the ball over 20 times, even if we turned it over 10 times and scored on the other 10 possessions, we would've scored 100 points almost. We can't just give people the ball, but we were still able to score. They didn't hold us scoreless. We just couldn't defend them. So you can't do both, you can't give them the ball and then not guard them. That is a recipe for absolute disaster.\"\n\nVanderbilt must bounce back fast before its matchup at Ole Miss on Jan. 29 (6:30 p.m. CT, SECN+). Ralph said that it's unlikely the Commodores will return to Nashville before heading to Oxford, Mississippi. Both locations were hit hard by the winter storm that has swept through nearly half the nation, bringing ice damage and power outages.\n\nUltimately, Ralph believes that playing in the hostile environment of Colonial Life Arena will be beneficial.\n\n\"This is a really tough environment to prepare for,\" she said. \"This is why I beg and plead for people to show up to our games, because we want to have a home environment like South Carolina has for our kids . . . The only way you prepare for it, I think, is by having one or continuing to have experience playing in one. A lot of my kids that played a lot of big minutes today haven't done that in this kind of environment.\n\n\" . . . I'm looking at myself even more than I'm looking at our players. How do we prepare them better? How do we help them more so that they can execute better in a game like this, when a team is firing on all cylinders at home? Absolutely, we've got to figure that out as a coaching staff. And then sometimes I know, as a player, you've just got to go through it to learn this. This was a really hard lesson to learn today. This was not fun. But I know my team, I know my staff, I know we are just fine.\"\n\nAria Gerson covers Vanderbilt athletics for The Tennessean.

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers could be seeing the return of one of their key bench players. Sam Merrill, who has missed the team’s last five games with a right-hand sprain, is listed as questionable for Monday’s game against the Orlando Magic.\n\nMerrill has been dealing with a hand sprain for much of the season. He injured it originally in a November win against the Milwaukee Bucks. This resulted in him missing just over a month of games. When he did return to the lineup, he wasn’t pain-free, as head coach Kenny Atkinson said at the time that he couldn’t even shake Merrill’s hand after games due to the pain he was in.\n\nMerrill injured his hand again in the team’s Jan. 14 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. That’s the same game in which Darius Garland injured his other toe.\n\nAnything bought from the links helps support Fear the Sword. You can also shop all of Homage’s Cavs gear HERE. The link to the new City Edition shirt can be found HERE.\n\nWe don’t have any further updates on Garland’s injury beyond what the team released last Sunday. The Cavs said that Garland would be reevaluated in seven to 10 days after suffering a Grade 1 right great toe sprain. That initial timeframe would put the reevaluation happening anytime between now and Wednesday.\n\nEven though the Cavs won’t be fully healthy for their game against the Magic, it would be beneficial to possibly get Merrill back in the lineup. Merrill has the third-best on/off differential on the team this season (+4.7 points per 100 possessions, 75th percentile). They’re 16-8 in the games he’s played.\n\nOn the season, Merrill is averaging 13.8 points on .470/.455/.882 shooting splits.\n\nThe Magic will once again be without their leading scorer, Franz Wagner (ankle), in Monday’s rematch.",

    "description": "The Cleveland Guardians had a clear reason for addressing the bullpen over the offseason.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Guardians were fairly active addressing one of the areas of their roster this offseason, even though it wasn’t the position group fans were hoping the team would spend some money on: the bullpen.\n\nChris Anonetti recently spoke about why Cleveland felt they needed to add more depth to the bullpen, and a little bit about the pitchers they brought in.\n\n\"We lost a couple of pitchers last year to some unfortunate circumstances, and then we had a couple of guys become free agents. So this was an area that we felt we wanted to try to supplement,” explained Antonetti (quote via Mason Horodyski of WEWS).\n\n“The group, by and large, did a really good job last year, but we didn't want to rest on that. We wanted to try to add some options, because we know it's an area that will be tested over the course of the season. We don't, we're going to need far more than just eight relievers to start the season with. We're gonna need to be 13, 14, 15, or more deep.”\n\nCleveland, as a group, had a reliever ERA of 3.44, which ranked third in MLB, and a WHIP of 1.23, which ranked third in the American League.\n\nHowever, as Antonetti noted, the Guardians will very likely be without Emmanuel Clase moving forward, and Jakob Junis, Nic Enright, Sam Hentges, Kolby Allard, and Zak Kent are off to their next team, leaving plenty of innings for the team to fill.\n\nThe Guardians did need to add some more arms to the reliever core, and to the front office’s credit, they do do just that by adding Shawn Armstrong, Colin Holderman, Connor Brogdon, and Rule 5 selected Payton Pallette.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly how all of these pieces fit together, but the Guardians have certainly given Stephen Vogt and the rest of the staff options to go to througohut the season.\n\nThere will definitely be a nice competition throughout spring training to see which arms start on the big-league roster, who will begin at Triple-A, and which pitchers may not have a role with the Guardians in 2026.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

Vrabel will be the second person ever to coach and play in a Super Bowl for the same team.\n\nVrabel joins Gary Kubiak as the only coach who has reached a Super Bowl with the same team as both a coach and a player. If the Patriots win the Super Bowl, Vrabel will be the first person in history to win a Super Bowl as a coach and player for the same franchise.\n\nTom Flores, Mike Ditka, Tony Dungy and Doug Pederson are the only people to win a Super Bowl as both a player and a coach, but none did so with the same team. Vrabel won three Super Bowls as a player, and in his first year as a head coach with the Patriots, he has taken them to the Super Bowl.\n\nVrabel is the eighth coach in history to lead a team to the Super Bowl in his first year with the team. He joins Kubiak, Jim Caldwell, Jon Gruden, Bill Callahan, George Seifert, Red Miller and Don McCafferty.\n\nThe Patriots were 4-13 last season, and in Vrabel’s first season, they went 14-3, won the AFC East and clinched the No. 2 seed in the AFC. It is the Patriots’ first Super Bowl appearance since the 2018 season, when they defeated the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nVrabel is a finalist for Coach of the Year. He won Coach of the Year in 2021 with the Tennessee Titans. He went to the AFC Championship in 2019 with the Titans. As a player, he was a Pro Bowler and First-Team All-Pro.\n\nAlthough Vrabel was a linebacker, he caught 12 touchdowns in his career in the regular season and playoffs combined. He also had 66 sacks, 24 forced fumbles and 851 tackles between the regular season and playoffs in his career.\n\nPatriots’ Drake Maye Joins Elite QB Company After Beating Broncos",

    "fullText": "Vincent Kompany is still learning on his job.\n\nThe 39-year-old, now in his second season at Bayern Munich, is still in the early part of his managerial career, which began only in 2020. In that time he’s overseen highs and lows, having both taken Burnley to promotion and suffering relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“I don’t think that winning titles makes you a good coach, or getting relegated makes you a bad one,” Kompany reflected in remarks captured by @iMiaSanMia. “A good coach is someone who learns something new every year, regardless of whether we win or lose.\n\n“We’re in a good position right now; it’s all about the details. We simply want to be competitive. We want to prepare well for the matches where trophies are at stake, where it’s about going through or being eliminated. In those moments, we have to have the big players fit because they’re the ones who decide the games for us.”\n\nWhat else is there to say? You have to love Kompany’s mindset. It is no surprise, given who he is and how he approaches his work, that he has found success at Bayern. Now the club is reflecting these attitudes in just about every way: every day, a little step forward.\n\nAnd this year? The stars seem to be lining up for the Bavarians. It would be a surprise to see them not go far in the Champions League.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings play five times in the final week of fantasy hockey before a lengthy matchup that starts before the NHL's Olympic break and ends after it.",
    "fullText": "While the Olympic break obviously makes NHL scheduling a lot more difficult, it is curious that Week 17 of the fantasy hockey season ends on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nIt's a standard seven-day week, but that means Week 18 will run from Monday, Feb. 2 to Sunday, March 1, putting the Olympics right in the middle of the matchup.\n\nWould it not have made more sense for the Olympic break to be the cut-off between Weeks 17 and 18, and run Week 17 from Monday, Jan. 26 to Thursday, Feb. 5 (11 days) and then Week 18 from Wednesday, Feb. 25 to Sunday, March 8 (12 days)? Anyway, I digress.\n\n(Week 18's primer will likely be split into two parts, one for Feb. 2 to 5, and then an update for Feb. 25 to March 8).\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings are the highlight in Week 17 with a league-high five games, though they're all on the road with two back-to-backs. The matchups are not easy, and with Sunday in Carolina being their fifth game in seven days – that one seems like a scheduled loss.\n\nThere are seven teams – the Islanders, Bruins, Golden Knights, Blue Jackets, Flyers, Mammoth and Rangers – that play four times, including a back-to-back, home-and-home series between the Isles and Rangers. That's a matchup where targeting Isles would be beneficial. Bo Horvat is back in the lineup and providing a more balanced offense, and the Rangers are completely lost in net without Igor Shesterkin.\n\nIt's a very heavy Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday schedule, so plan accordingly, as there's only one game on Friday and three games on Sunday, leaving little wiggle room if you're far behind entering Saturday's games.\n\nAll positions and rostered percentages are courtesy of Yahoo Fantasy.\n\nPick players from teams at the top of the schedule matrix to maximize games and matchups. Green is good. Red is bad. Points percentages are as of Sunday morning.\n\nFantilli's fantasy value this season has oscillated from potential breakout star to occasional streamer with occasional hot streaks. Note, however, Fantilli's seen increased ice time under Rick Bowness, and he's responded accordingly with plenty of shots, hits and faceoff wins. With increased ice time, the offensive production should come. So far, Fantilli has been underwhelming, and if there's a stat that might point toward a turnaround under Bowness, it's his curiously low 9.3 shooting percentage.\n\nKent Johnson was the flavor of the week last week, but the spike in ice time was likely Bowness trying to see what Johnson can do, and the 11:15 of ice time versys Dallas and 13:12 versus Tampa is evidence Bowness wasn't impressed.\n\nNHL Power Rankings: Each Team's Biggest Trade Bait Will there be more trades before the Olympic break? The action's already heating up as we look at one player per team who could be traded in this week's NHL power rankings.\n\nCirelli has two goals and six points in his past three games, taking over L1 from the injured Brayden Point and Nick Paul dropping down to L4. Dominic James gets L2 with Jake Guentzel, but Cirelli is the safer option. The Lightning can change up their lines at any moment – their blueline is decimated once again with Erik Cernak injured – but Cirelli's the most logical player to target for L1/PP2 upside on an excellent team.\n\nAlex Lyon's 26-save shutout against the Isles gives me pause on holding Luukkonen all season because it gives the Sabres a legitimate case for all three of their goalies to see increased playing time. Remember, too, it was difficult for Luukkonen to get into a rhythm when he played so sparingly upon returning from injury.\n\nWith no back-to-backs and only three games in Week 17, it's very probable Luukkonen only sees action once, with Luukkonen, Lyon and Colten Ellis each getting a start. It's not ideal, but the difference between this season and last season is that the Sabres are legitimately good, so it's still worth holding onto Luukkonen just in case he performs the best and gets an extra start or two.\n\nIt was too quick to proclaim Montembeault's return as the No. 1. After a string of five games where he only lost once, Montembeault has allowed seven goals in his two most recent games, both of which were losses. The reprieve for Montembeault is that only three of the goals allowed were at even strength (though one was shorthanded), but it opens the door again for Jakub Dobes to get more playing time. Really tough schedule for the Habs in Week 17 with the Knights and Avalanche at home and then a road date in Buffalo.\n\nConsidering Adin Hill hasn't exactly been sharp since his return, Schmid still holds plenty of fantasy value as they continue to alternate starts. Long-term, Hill is still the play, but Schmid has generally been quite good this season – 15 wins in 22 starts but a pedestrian .896 SP – and will continue to win games, especially since the Knights are expected to load up ahead of the trade deadline, even after acquiring Rasmus Andersson.\n\nOlofsson scored three points in three games entering Sunday's game against the Leafs, and he has seen his ice time spike to over 20 minutes per game following a promotion to L1 and PP1 with Nathan MacKinnon. (He came skated about 18 minutes on Sunday against the Leafs). He's an excellent shooter but is prone to streaks and inconsistent play, but as long as he's in this role, there's some under-the-radar fantasy value. Olofsson provides good shot volume as long as he gets the ice time, with a pretty good conversion rate at a 13.2 shooting percentage, though he tends to be most effective on the power play.\n\nKasper's had a tough season, but his potential is evident, and that's one reason why the Wings have kept him in the lineup virtually all season. (He was scratched for one game in late December, with Mason Appleton returning from injury).\n\nThat patience seems to be paying off; Kasper has two goals and six points in his past five games, with his ice time spiking to 17:29 in a tough matchup in Minnesota. His production was bound to spike if you consider his unsustainably low 6.3 shooting percentage – he shot 13.1 percent last season – and it's always a good sign that a player has confidence when he elects to shoot on a 2-on-1 rush, as he did Saturday against the Jets.\n\nIt might take Chytil some time to find his rhythm – he narrowly missed an excellent opportunity to convert a goal in his first game back against the Devils on Friday – but still finished the game with 18:29 of ice time, eight faceoff wins, two shots and a hit. Injury risk is always a concern, but the Canucks desperately needed his presence down the middle, and he offers L2 and PP2 upside.\n\nChytil's 50-point upside and solid shooting volume – at least two shots per game – make him one of the more worthwhile gambles off the waiver wire at this point in the season, even at a pretty deep position.\n\nShayne Gostisbehere is battling a groin issue – again – which puts Walker on PP1. The Canes are hoping Gostisbehere returns before the Olympic break, but if he doesn't, Walker's fantasy value spikes with the new role. Walker obviously doesn't have as much offensive upside as Gostisbehere, and Alexander Nikishin and K'Andre Miller could both challenge for some PP1 minutes (they're on PP2 right now), but Walker can still provide a high floor with hits and blocks. In deeper leagues where defense is thin, Walker is a low-risk pickup with upside.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley took 6-6 center Madina Okot out of the starting lineup and went with four guards. Here's why.",
    "fullText": "COLUMBIA — Fresh off the first SEC loss of the season, South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley took Madina Okot out of the starting lineup.\n\nThe 6-6 center still scored 17 points in the 103-74 win over No. 4 Vanderbilt on Jan. 25.\n\n\"Madina is not the scapegoat at all,\" Staley said. \"It was totally giving her a look at the game. Just take a little bit of pressure off of her, because we're putting her in situations that we have had (previous) players build to those moments.\"\n\nFreshman Agot Makeer started in Okot's place for South Carolina for a four-guard lineup. Okot was 8-of-9 from the floor with seven rebounds and five steals, a game after she had six points in the loss to No. 16 Oklahoma on Jan. 22.\n\nStaley said legendary South Carolina players like A'ja Wilson and Aaliyah Boston didn't have to dominate as freshmen or in Okot's case, in their first year with the team after transferring. Okot started for Mississippi State last year but the expectations differed.\n\n\"I know she felt better that she wasn't in at the beginning of the game, she could see how they were playing, what they might do, get her mind ready to play,\" Staley said. \"Sometimes that's all some players need is a different look at it.\"\n\nWilson started in her first exhibition game as a freshman in 2014 but then didn't start in a real game until her sophomore year.\n\n\"The entire crowd anticipated (Wilson) coming in and just doing all the things that she would she would normally do if she was a starter,\" Staley said. \"We just kind of took a page out of that book to make sure Madina gives us something.\"\n\nOkot was 3-of-9 from the floor against Oklahoma, and had just four rebounds with three turnovers.\n\nOkot checked in with 5:23 left in the first quarter then got a steal less than 20 seconds later. She dribbled down the court as two Vanderbilt guards caught up with her and kicked back out to Ta'Niya Latson at the 3-point line. Latson gave Okot the ball back inside and she made the layup through contact.\n\n\"Madina played extremely well,\" Latson said. \"She went out there and she got back to herself.\"\n\nLatson's short jumper with 1:30 left in the first quarter rolled out and Okot caught the rebound, kept it high in her hands and got the putback layup plus the foul.\n\n\"I feel like it was a different presence for (Okot) out there,\" said guard Tessa Johnson. \"That's the Madina that we've been missing, and I think she really picked it up. It was good for her and the team.\"\n\nLulu Kesin covers South Carolina athletics for The Greenville News and the USA TODAY Network. Email her at LKesin@usatodayco.com.

    "fullText": "World number one Scottie Scheffler launched his 2026 US PGA Tour campaign with a runaway victory in the American Express at La Quinta, California.\n\nScheffler, whose 2025 season included two major titles among six victories, piled up nine birdies in a six-under par 66 on the Stadium Course, where even a double-bogey at the 17th was barely a blip on the way to a 27-under par total of 261 and a four-shot victory.\n\nAustralian veteran Jason Day climbed into a share of second with a superb eight-under par 64. He was joined on 265 by Americans Ryan Gerard, Matt McCarty and Andrew Putnam, Gerard posting a seven-under 65 and McCarty and Putnam each signing for a 68.\n\nScheffler, 29, became the first player since Tiger Woods to grab his 20th US PGA Tour title before the age of 30. He's off to his fifth straight season with at least one victory.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Scheffler said. \"It was a challenging week. I did a good job of staying patient and executing when I needed to.\"\n\nScheffler, who hasn't missed a cut on the PGA Tour since August 2022, started the day one off the lead and opened with a birdie. He bogeyed the second before settling in with back-to-back birdies at four and five and another pair at seven and eight.\n\nHe added four more birdies coming in, his four-footer at the par-five 16th pushing him to 29-under.\n\nHe was in the water off the tee on the way to a double-bogey at the par-three 17th, but by then there was no catching him.\n\nOvernight leader Kim Si-woo of South Korea carded an even par 72 to tie for sixth on 22-under.\n\nTeenager Blades Brown, who started the day tied with Scheffler on 21-under, closed with a two-over 74 for a share of 18th.\n\nIt finished off a remarkable week for the 18-year-old from Tennessee, who tied for 17th in a Korn Ferry event in the Bahamas on Wednesday before a dash to California to tee it up on a sponsor's exemption.\n\nHe flirted with a 59 on Friday, when a 60 gave him a share of the halfway lead. He had a birdie chance at 18 for a share of 10th -- and a place in the Torrey Pines field.\n\nHe closed with a bogey but departed happy with his week.\n\n\"I could probably write a book about what I've learned these past couple of days,\" Brown said.\n\n\"Just knowing that I can compete out here. It was so cool watching Scottie win in person and getting to play with him.\n\n\"He's such an unbelievable guy. He talked to me numerous times throughout the round and was giving me a lot of encouragement, so it was awesome.\"",

    "fullText": "After the biggest game of the season, the Vegas Golden Knights subsequently put together their worst outing.\n\nOn Sunday, the Ottawa Senators embraced the NFL spirit and put up a touchdown and extra point on the Golden Knights, defeating them 7-1.\n\nDespite Mitch Marner getting a penalty shot early on, it was the Senators having more jump in the first period. It eventually paid off with Fabian Zetterlund firing a puck off of Kaedan Korczak behind the net to beat Adin Hill to get Ottawa off to a 1-0 start.\n\nThe second period would see the Senators take advantage after the Golden Knights missed an opportunity on a 5-on-3 power play. Dylan Cozens would make good on a scoring chance with Hill well out of position to double the Ottawa lead. 18 seconds later, Jordan Spence would beat Hill clean from the point to add to the punishment.\n\nAnother mistake allowed Stephen Halliday to push the lead to four goals, and the Golden Knights were in deep trouble.\n\nThe third period would start with Cozens and Halliday’s second goals of the game getting past Hill just over two minutes in. Former Golden Knight Nick Cousins would finish the job with the seventh Ottawa goal.\n\nIt would not be all bad for the Golden Knights, with Rasmus Andersson scoring his first goal in a Golden Knights jersey, but it was far too little, far too late.\n\nThe Andersson goal prevented the worst loss in Golden Knights franchise history. They have lost by six goals only three other times prior to tonight.\n\nThe Golden Knights will hope to rebound quickly from this embarrassment when they head to Quebec to face the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Chris Finch's voice cracked and faltered as the coach expressed on behalf of the Minnesota Timberwolves their heartbreak for the community's collective fear and pain from the ongoing immigration crackdown, following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a federal officer.\n\nFinch presents a straightforward, no-nonsense approach in his public statements and rarely reveals much emotion, but he was clearly moved by the situation in Minneapolis before his team hosted Golden State on Sunday. The game between the Timberwolves and Warriors was postponed by 24 hours, after Pretti was killed on Saturday.\n\n“I’m more than a resident. This is my home. I love living here. I love being a part of this community. I’ve been embraced from day one. People have been amazing. It’s sad to watch what is happening,” said Finch, who was hired by the Timberwolves five years ago. “On the human level, certainly as somebody who takes great pride in being here, I know a lot of our players feel the same. They all love being here, and it’s just hard to watch what we’re going through.”\n\nThe Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti prior to the national anthem, just as they did for Renee Good before their game on Jan. 8, the day after she was fatally shot by a federal officer. The Trump administration in December launched what the Department of Homeland Security declared the largest immigration enforcement operation in history and earlier this month announced a surge of more officers to push their force past 2,000.\n\nThe NBA announced Saturday that the rescheduling decision was made to “prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community” after Pretti was killed during a confrontation in a commercial district less than 2 miles south of Target Center. Finch said on Sunday that the Timberwolves pushed for the postponement to respect the public grieving process.\n\n“Playing basketball just didn't feel like the right thing to do,” Finch said, thanking the NBA and the Warriors for their support.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr, long one of the league's most outspoken coaches, was measured but clearly moved as he expressed his own sympathy.\n\n“This has always been a great stop on the NBA tour. I love the city of Minneapolis. People here are wonderful, and it’s very sad what’s happening. I feel for the city. There’s a pall that’s been cast over the city. You can feel it. A lot of people are suffering, and obviously a loss of life is the number one concern. Those families will never get their family members back,” Kerr said.\n\nTens of thousands of people swarmed downtown Minneapolis on Friday in protest of the tactics and presence of immigration officers, a crowd the Warriors could see from their hotel as it moved toward Target Center. A smaller protest march took place downtown before the game Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of other voices being raised around the sports world on Sunday. Women's basketball star Breanna Stewart held a sign with \"abolish ICE\" printed on it during introductions at her Unrivaled league game. Minnesota Frost fans during a PWHL game chanted “Ice out now!” The NBA Players Association issued a statement in support of the protests in Minnesota and urged its members to speak up.\n\nThe perspectives in a polarized country vary wildly on what constitutes constitutionally protected protesting and what becomes violent political disruption, and Kerr seemed to sense that tension as he spoke before the game on Sunday.\n\n“People are so angry. There should be an appeal to our better angels to look after one another and to recognize what’s happening. We’re being divided by media for profit, by misinformation. There’s so much out there that is really difficult for all of us to sort of reconcile,” Kerr said. “And so in times like these you have to lean on values and who you are and who you want to be, either as an individual or a country.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "As the NFL makes more and more officiating misses subject to replay review, the lingering blind spots become more and more glaring.\n\nIt's time (in fact, it's long overdue) for missed facemask fouls to be called via replay.\n\nThere's no reason not to do it. Replay currently can be used to undo an erroneous facemask call. Why shouldn't it be used when a clear and obvious foul was missed?\n\nIt happened during the second quarter of Sunday's NFC Championship, when Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had his facemask grabbed on a third-down sack that forced a field goal. If the penalty hadn't been missed, the Rams would have gotten 15 yards and a fresh set of downs.\n\nSome would say the NFL resists using replay to put a flag on the field. From its inception, however, the current replay rules have allowed a penalty to be called for having too many men on the field.\n\nToday, too many things are reviewable to justify omitting something that requires no subjectivity. And it's eventually going to affect a huge game, in a huge spot.\n\nIt affected today's huge NFC Championship, ending a potential touchdown drive that could have tied the game at 10 and forcing the Rams to settle for three. And it's a flaw that can easily be fixed.",

While there are some notable NFL-wifes with high profiles like Taylor Swift and Hailee Steinfeld, Ann Michael is a hometown fixture who has been with Maye dating back to their childhood.\n\nTheir relationship that began in a North Carolina middle school when they were just 12 years old. Far from the curated spectacle of celebrity culture, Ann Michael’s rise to prominence in New England has felt remarkably organic — built on a foundation of childhood memories, athletic pedigree, and a viral baking series that has endeared her to a city once defined by the glitz of the runway.\n\nGet to know Maye's wife, who is becoming New England's sweetheart one video at a time.\n\nMaye's wife is Ann Michael. The couple has been together for over a decade, dating through their years at William A.

She is making a name of her own on social media, largely through her viral TikTok series, \"Bakemas,\" which has transformed her into a digital sensation with hundreds of thousands of followers. What began as a simple holiday baking project has expanded into a bona-fide brand, earning her the affectionate title of the \"Queen of the North\" among the Patriots faithful and even landing her a dedicated television segment on NBC Sports Boston titled \"Beyond Bakemas.\"\n\n#Patriots QB Drake Maye and his wife, Ann Michael Maye, on the field after New England's playoff win and the final game of the season at Gillette Stadium.\n\n(📸: annmichaelhmaye/IG) pic.twitter.com/krba7prXHw\n\n— New England Sports Fellow (@_JosephManning) January 19, 2026\n\nHer influence stretches beyond the kitchen, as she has become a fixture in the local community — teaching fitness classes and exploring the streets of Newbury and Nantucket.

Her brother, Tad Hudson, also shares a football connection as a fellow quarterback who was actually teammates with Drake at UNC.\n\nThis past season, she became a digital sensation with her viral \"Bakemas\" TikTok series, where she shared daily holiday recipes that earned her over 370,000 followers. The phenomenon grew so large that it landed her a professional television project.\n\nPatriots QB Drake Maye and his wife, Ann Michael, help carry donated Thanksgiving food and goods to the cars of families in need here in Boston. pic.twitter.com/FAU7cWvPQN\n\n— Meghan Ottolini (@Meghan_Ottolini) November 25, 2025\n\nThe couple began their marriage with an incredible gesture by reportedly donating nearly $100,000 worth of wedding gifts to local shelters in their hometown.\n\nMORE: How many kids does Stefon Diggs have?\n\nAnn Michael has been by Drake's side since they were 12 years old.

    "fullText": "Jose Ramirez is going to make history for the Cleveland Guardians originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians have secured their leading man, as Jose Ramirez has agreed to a new extension that will keep him in Cleveland until his age 39 season. The Guards are giving Ramirez a raise of sorts, with the long-time third baseman agreeing to terms on a seven-year, $175 contract extension that runs through 2032. Ramirez had three years and $69 million left on his current deal, so this new deal will see him get a bump while adding four more years to his current deal.\n\nThe extension also all but guarantees Ramirez the ability to finish his career with the Guardians and as Cleveland's all-time leader in multiple categories. Thus cementing him as the de facto all-time face of the franchise.\n\nAssuming he can stay healthy for most of the deal, he's looking at taking the top spot in numerous categories, including, but not limited to;\n\nOffensive WAR (Currently 3rd and 16.8 points behind Tris Speaker)\n\nGames Played (Currently 3rd and just 10 games off of first place, Terry Turner)\n\nAt-Bats (Currently 2nd and just 65 at-bats off of first-place Nap Lajoie)\n\nRuns Scored (Currently 3rd and 153 runs off of first-place Earl Averill)\n\nHits (Currently 7th and sits 379 hits off of Lajoie)\n\nTotal Bases (Currently 2nd and sits 193 off of Averill)\n\nDoubles (Currently 3rd and is 88 off of Speaker)\n\nHome Runs (Currently 2nd and is 52 off of Jim Thome)\n\nRBIs (Currently 2nd and is 135 off of Averill)\n\nBase on Balls (Currently 9th and is342 off of Thome)\n\nStolen Bases (Currently 2nd and is 165 off of Kenny Lofton).\n\nMost of these records will fall in the next few years, but some could take four or five at his current rate of production. He's alreadyat the top of some categories, which include;\n\nIt's pretty remarkable to see just how dominant he's been and how loyal he's been. Yet, there's also a sharp critique of the MLB in there, too. The Guardians and MLB's inability to keep players in smaller markets is the reason why this feat is not only so rare but even possible for Ramirez. With some of the biggest names in the game's history having played significant time in the city, you'd think it'd be nearly impossible for Ramirez to land atop some 15 categories. Especially ones where player skillsets don't normally overlap (home runs and stolen bases, for instance).\n\nWith teams like the LA Dodgers paying more on their luxury tax bill than the Guardians will spend on their payroll, it's becoming rarer and rarer for teams like the Guardians to keep their players, but this isn't a new issue.\n\nTeams like the Philadelphia Phillies, Boston Red Sox nd New York Yankees have historically overpaid for players, especially Cleveland's. If it weren't for the wealth discrepancy in the Major Leagues, guys like Thome, Manny Ramirez, and C.C. Sabathia may have never left Cleveland.\n\nIf that's the case, who knows if Ramirez even gets close to some of these records? Guys like Thome and Ramirez raked the ball as well as anyone historically, and each finished with Hall of Fame-worthy numbers. It would've been nearly impossible for Ramirez to take as many top spots as he's about to if some guys didn't leave due to better contracts.\n\nThat said, they did leave, and now Ramirez has the chance to cement his name all over the Cleveland history books. Which should give fans of the Guards something to hang their hat on at least.",

Tackle Garett Bolles and guard Quinn Meinerz both earned First-Team All-Pro selections, and the return of center Luke Wattenberg was expected to solidify the unit on Sunday.\n\nDenver allowed two fewer sacks than New England, but Williams and the Patriots had the last laugh after shutting the Broncos out in the second half to capture an AFC championship on the road.\n\nEarlier in the week, Williams rubbed some Broncos fans the wrong way when he was asked what he knew about Stidham.\n\n\"I ain't gonna lie, nothing. We're gonna watch the tape on him and figure out what he like to do. But no. They didn't like him over the Bo, so,\" Williams said.\n\nSome interpreted Williams' response as simple honesty, as the Patriots had never had a reason to prepare for Stidham before Nix's injury, but others saw the comment as an underestimation of the Broncos' backup quarterback.\n\nIf Denver interpreted Williams' remarks as bulletin board material, it didn't make much of a difference in the end.\n\nBest pictures in the snow from Patriots' win in Denver blizzard\n\n3 Sean Payton calls that came back to bite Broncos\n\nHow weather negatively impacted AFC championship game\n\nPatriots take advantage of controversial Drake Maye 'tush push' play",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles have a very exciting young baseball team, but last season they played far worse than expected, which led to Brandon Hyde being fired early on. During the managerial search for the right fit, the position was an attractive one given the talent on the roster. Ultimately, the Orioles decided to hire Craig Albernaz.\n\n“The Orioles’ search for a new manager is over. Baltimore has hired Cleveland associate manager Craig Albernaz to become its skipper, the club announced Monday,” MLB.com’s Jake Rill wrote.\n\nThe Orioles have had a huge offseason so far, even though most of their moves came at the start of free agency. Acquiring Pete Alonso was a major coup, alongside several other additions. With some names still left on the market, Baltimore could also pursue Framber Valdez.\n\n“Baltimore has already committed $195 million to four free agents -- Pete Alonso, Ryan Helsley, Zach Eflin and Leody Taveras -- ranking sixth in spending thus far. But general manager Mike Elias, entering the final year of his contract, has one more haymaker left: Framber Valdez. With Ranger Suárez landing $130 million over five years in Boston, Valdez projects to get around six years and $180 million -- a deal that would vault the O's past the Dodgers and Blue Jays as baseball's top free agent spenders,” ESPN’s Paul Hembekides wrote.\n\nAdding Valdez would be huge for the Orioles, bolstering their rotation significantly. Part of the reason his free-agent market has dragged on is the controversy over a questionable pitch-crossing incident.\n\n“Both Framber Valdez and César Salazar were brought into the manager’s office after the game. Valdez is said to have apologized to Salazar but said the cross-up was not on purpose,” JomBoy Media wrote.\n\nIf the cross-up wasn’t intentional, then Valdez has no character concerns, allowing the Orioles to pursue the World Series–winning lefty without hesitation. Baltimore is eager to return to the playoffs after their 100-win season just a couple of years ago.\n\nValdez would likely play a major role in that push, as the Orioles aim to rebound after a disappointing 2025. While only time will tell, this move would help Baltimore compete in a stacked AL East.",

    "fullText": "Bills coaching rumors tracker: Latest news on Brian Daboll, Joe Brady, other potential Sean McDermott replacements originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills became the tenth team to fire their head coach in the 2025-2026 season as they parted ways with Sean McDermott. He was hired ahead of the 2017 season and amassed a 98-50 regular-season record.\n\nMcDermott was let go after another early playoff exit. He went 8-8 in the postseason and never won in the AFC Championship Game to make the Super Bowl.\n\nThis puts some pressure on the possible head coaching candidate for the Bills. McDermott won the AFC East five of the last six seasons. Buffalo believes it is in win-now mode, and the new head coach will be expected to hit the ground running and may not have a year or two to ease into the gig. This suggests that the Bills will target experienced head coaches, which makes the hiring process all the more interesting.\n\nHere are the latest rumors on Buffalo's coaching search.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best Bills coaching candidates to replace Sean McDermott\n\nBills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, also a top candidate for a promotion to head coach in Buffalo, is in Las Vegas on Sunday for a second interview for the Raiders' head coaching job, per Schefter.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Buffalo completed an interview with the Jaguars' offensive coordinator Grant Udinski. Udinski is a fast-rising 30-year-old assistant who has already garnered significant interest from other teams, including the Cleveland Browns.\n\nRapoport reports that former quarterback Philip Rivers is under \"serious consideration\" for the Buffalo Bills' head coaching vacancy after an impressive in-person interview. Despite Rivers having only high school coaching experience, his strong relationship with Josh Allen and his reputation as a charismatic leader have made him a legitimate candidate to replace Sean McDermott.\n\nThe Bills have interviewed former quarterbacks Philip Rivers and Davis Webb for their open head coaching position. Both of them, as well as current quarterback Josh Allen, share the same agent.\n\nBuffalo fielded an interview with Miami defensive coordinator  Anthony Weaver on Saturday. The former Ravens and Texans defensive end has been a hot name in the coaching carousel in recent years, also drawing interest from the Ravens and Steelers in their head-coaching searches.\n\nFormer Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel has already accepted a job as the Los Angeles Chargers' new offensive coordinator, though the contract remains unsigned. This was more of a backup plan for him, as he is still eligible to interview for head coaching roles. McDaniel was expected to interview with the Browns and the Bills last week but backed out of both.\n\nMcDaniel was scheduled to meet with the Bills on Friday, January 23.\n\nRivers came out of retirement to play for the Indianapolis Colts at the end of the year, and he did say he might be interested in coaching once he retires for good. Rivers has experience coaching high school football, but none at the pro level.\n\nWe have completed an interview with Philip Rivers for our head coaching position.\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) January 23, 2026\n\nLynn will interview on Saturday as part of a busy weekend for the Bills interview team, as all these interviews will take place in Florida. The former Los Angeles Chargers coach spent a few seasons in Buffalo as an assistant coach under Rex Ryan, and even coached one game as an interim head coach.\n\nMcDaniel agreed to take the Los Angeles Chargers offensive coordinator job, but that is only if he doesn'd land a head coaching opportunity. The former Miami Dolphins head coach played the Bills twice a season in the AFC East for the last four years.\n\nNext up on the Bills interview list is Brian Daboll. The 50-year-old was Buffalo's offensive coordinator from 2018-21, parlaying his success with the Josh Allen-attack into a head-coaching gig with the Giants. Per Russini, Daboll's covets the Bills position. He'll get his first chance to push for the role on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to the media alongside owner Terry Pegula, Bills GM Brandon Beane said Wednesday that the team will conduct \"100 percent an open search,\" with Josh Allen expected to have input. Beane says the list of candidates the Bills plan to interview includes coaches still coaching in the playoffs.\n\nThe Bills' fifth and sixth interview requests went out to Jaguars OC Grant Udinski and Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver. Udinski, who would be the youngest head coach in NFL history if hired, has a second interview lined up with the Browns, while Weaver is a candidate for the Ravens and Steelers jobs.\n\nThe first defensive-minded candidate for the Bills is Colts DC Lou Anarumo, who has never been an NFL head coach but has drawn interest for his work between Cincinnati and Indianapolis. Anarumo is the fourth known head coaching candidate for the Bills.\n\nThe Bills will interview Anthony Lynn, Brian Daboll, and Joe Brady for their head coaching job, making that trio the first three confirmed candidates.\n\nLynn, formerly the head coach of the Chargers and once a Bills assistant, is currently the Commanders’ running game coordinator, while Brady is the Bills’ offensive coordinator and Daboll held that role from 2018-21 before becoming the Giants’ head coach.\n\nDaboll is likely going to be a coaching candidate for the open job in Buffalo. Despite what happened during his tenure with the New York Giants, he did serve as the Bills' offensive coordinator from 2018 to 2021. This coincided with the first four seasons of Allen's career, so Daboll helped provide a foundation for the quarterback.\n\nIn the four seasons with Daboll as the OC, Allen played in 61 games and had 14,114 passing yards with 100 touchdowns and 46 interceptions. He added 2,325 rushing yards with 31 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nThe quarterback has played in 67 games without Daboll as his OC. In that span, he has 15,988 yards with 117 touchdowns and 48 interceptions. Allen has 2,396 rushing yards with 48 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nMORE: What's next for Sean McDermott?\n\nBrady is the current offensive coordinator for the Bills. He would help to provide consistency in the organization, but Buffalo would have to decide if it trusts that the OC has something in him to get past the postseason hump that plagued McDermott's tenure.\n\nHe served as the quarterbacks coach in 2022 and 2023 before being promoted to interim offensive coordinator in 2023. He was made the permanent offensive coordinator in 2024, coincidentally the year that Allen won his first MVP Award.\n\nMORE: Why did the Bills fire Sean McDermott?\n\nIn the two full seasons with Brady as the OC, Allen has played in 34 games and had 7,399 yards with 53 touchdowns and 16 interceptions with an additional 1,110 yards and 26 touchdowns on the ground.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have spent the last season engineering a remarkable turnaround, and on Sunday, they stunned the NFL by completing their journey back to the Super Bowl with an AFC Championship win over the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Patriots captured a 10-7 win over the Broncos in a defensive struggle that turned out to be the second consecutive snow game for New England. And despite the challenging wintry environment and natural atmospheric challenges that accompany a trip to Empower Field at Mile High, the Patriots took care of business for their 17th victory of the season, returning to the Super Bowl for the first time since capturing Super Bowl LIII at the close of the 2018 season.\n\nThe Super Bowl appearance for the Patriots puts the cherry on top of a remarkable season that has gone better for the organization than any of their fans – or really anyone who follows the league – could have imagined. The Patriots are coming off back-to-back four-win seasons and are in their first season under the leadership of head coach Mike Vrabel, who previously captured three Super Bowls as a player with the franchise.\n\nThe Patriots will face the winner of the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, as the NFC West Divisional Rivals battle in a rubber match on Sunday night in the NFC Championship Game after splitting their first two games of the year.

    "fullText": "It all started a week or two ago, when my partner Maartje found a Dutch translation of Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park somewhere. It is an original 1991 edition. This means the cover image had been produced before the movie was made. It is necessarily completely free of the iconography of the film that would come to overshadow the novel, and indeed overshadow all other dinosaur media. That logo, that skeleton, that font, the designs of those dinosaurs and those characters which are all etched into our collective consciousness, none of it shows up on the cover. It’s a thing unto itself, and it is a thing to behold indeed. I’ll show it to you in a minute, but it got me thinking.\n\nHow many more of these are out there? How many localizations of Crichton’s sci-fi novel have been produced around the world, with unique cover art that predates the Spielberg film? How many of these were produced by book cover artists who in normal circumstances would have never illustrated anything close to a dinosaur? I took to the Internet, and the results exceeded all my expectations. It is true that most versions of the book you can get nowadays simply have the well-known logo on the cover. Boring! Nevertheless, I found a wealth of unique and remarkable, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, book covers that are independent from the visual language of the movie. Not all of these predate the film proper, but they were still unique enough to include. As a connoisseur of kitschy dinosaur Europeana, I’m gonna review a bunch o them! And I’ll save the Dutch one for last, because I’m a tease like that.\n\nLet’s start in Italy. This, too, is a 1991 original (the novel itself is from 1990, but translations take a while). I must admit that, in most cases, I have no idea who produced these book covers; I’m not quite committed enough to get a copy of all of these myself to find out. That’s a shame, because as far as these go, I see a pretty servicable dinosaur here. Believe me, they get much worse… The eagle-eyed among you will have recognized the influence of Burian, specifically his 1959 Allosaurus. The environment it’s stomping around in looks less like a high-tech theme park in the Costa Rican jungle and more like a cheap resort in Florida. I bet that house looked like that before the dinosaur attack. The dinosaur looks smaller than you’d expect, too, compared to these humans. Poundland Jurassic Park. A nice pulpy book cover, very appropriate for the novel.\n\nStaying in Southern Europe, this 1992 Spanish edition is simultaneously more stylish and more freaky. This highly stylized dinosaur looks more like some quadrupedal mammalian monster rearing up, some sort of awful earless dog. The stance and forelimbs are obviously referenced from a four-legged animal. Sit, Rex. This is what happens when an artist with no prior experience in dinosaurs, no relevant palaeoart reference points, and no internet tries this sort of thing; it can only happen in very specific circumstances, and it could not happen today. That’s why these vintage covers are irresistible to me.\n\nThis Polish edition comes not with a cover illustration, but with model photography. It’s a perfectly decent 1990s T. rex model, better than any toy from around this time anyway. However, it’s still obviously made of plastic and gives the book a slightly cheap vibe. Would you be seen on the train reading this?\n\nApparently, this is what the original 1991 German edition looked like. Sadly, I’ve found no higher resolution image than this. It might be faked, but it’s extremely eccentric anyway. Thanks to Maike for sending me a good photo! It’s real! A stylized, simplified cover in jolly primary colours with a jolly dinosaur silhouette, complete with jolly bizarro proportions. Those long arms are really something. According to the comments, it’s based on Peter Zallinger. I just know that the shadowy guy running away is the same dork who waves at all the dinosaurs in all the size charts on Wikipedia. Those playful fonts and colours don’t really sell the danger of the story to me. I love how the original German title of the book was just “Dinopark”.\n\nThere’s been a ton of different German editions over the years. Many of these are delightfully offbeat. Here’s another model T. rex in extreme close up. The infamous Jurassic Park font makes an appearance here, so we’re post-movie.\n\nGermany is the gift that keeps giving; this one is as recent as 2005. This one is especially baffling. The font in the title could be that a romance novel. The backround is a swamp, while the dinosaur model looks especially cheap and ugly. The German text on the cover explains how this novel and Spielberg’s film conquered the world. Just a complete mishmash of unrelated elements on this book cover.\n\nAnother German-language edition. This might be the Austrian one, though I’m not sure. This is the most stylish one we’ve seen so far, and for obvious reason: plagiarism! You’ve no doubt recognized Burian’s heroic Tarbosaurus on the cover here, even if it has been silhouetted out and given a different background. I won’t deny this looks cool, though. You can’t go wrong with Burian.\n\nSpeaking of Burian: what about Czechia? Disappointingly, the land that brought forth the world’s greatest palaeoartist has to make do with nothing but re-used stock art on the cover. If you’re my age, you will probably recognize this as the Neil Lloyd T. rex from Dinosaurs! Magazine! It doesn’t look like a whole lot of effort went into this book cover.\n\nBut we can always do worse. Here’s a later Czech version, with none other than the Papo T. rex on the cover! Absolutely no shame. Zdeněk must be turning in his grave.\n\nHere’s at last something that looks like original artwork to me. Or is this something pre-existing, cut out from its original background? Anyway, this is an Hungarian edition. Nothing especially noteworthy here; just a slightly dodgy drooling dinosaur.\n\nThis one is also Hungarian. From 1996, so the movie logo makes an appearance, but it’s weird enough to be interesting. At the top, we see a bizarre, goofy, wild-eyed cartoon dinosaur in various stages of polygonal rendering… did the cover artist confuse genetic research with computer generated art? It does look oddly frog-like, that’s an important plot point in the story. The rex skull is absent from the logo, where’d it go? I think this is the sequel, The Lost World. Sziget means island (as every European hipster definitely knows), so this reads “Monster Island”, while the above means “Park of Primitive Creatures”. I also appreciate how the author of this book is called Cmriicchhateoln. Graphic Design is my passion!\n\nI’m a big fan of this Swedish edition. It captures some of that childlike wonder. There’s a bit of Burian in that T. rex, and maybe a bit of Bernard Robinson? Copied from one of those ubiquitous 80s/90s T. rex images you’d see places. I don’t know, I’ve seen so much of this stuff, man. The covers uses a variation of the Jurassic Park Neuland font, so it must be a post-movie edition.\n\nRussia can always be relied upon for quality idiosyncratic covers, and they do not disappoint. The dinosaur that greets us on this purple cover is even cute, with those big hamster cheeks and friendly eyes. At the same time, it’s not the worst T. rex we’ve seen on these covers by a long shot, with the shape of the skull actually quite well observed. I have a hard time finding this one scary, though.\n\nHere’s another Russian edition, and this has to be one of my favourites. The creature on the cover here looks as much like a dragon as it does a dinosaur. Contrasting with the previous one, this is a completely fanciful creature that is, again, not produced by anyone who’s ever done dinosaurs before. It doesn’t even have arms. If anything, this looks like the skull lizard creatures of Kong: Skull Island. The typography and design on this one are absolutely 90s-tastic.\n\nOut of the many Russian editions I found, this one looks the classiest. As I live and breathe, that looks like an honest-to-Zeus piece of actual competent palaeoart on the cover! It could be Greg Paul or one of his disciples. I hope it wasn’t stolen. The elegant font completes the picture. I don’t like the orange, though.\n\nAnother favourite is this Turkish version, from 1993. It came out to tie in with the film, but the artwork is original. Once again, our T. rex is completely monstrous and out there. It’s based on Frazetta, probably. It’s more of a vintage guy-in-a-suit Godzilla than anything, and the sauropods haven’t got the memo yet about how they’re not supposed to be in the water. The scalation on the T. rex is interesting, they look less like the big scales of an animal and more like rocks, as if the creature is some sort of golem, made from the very Earth itself. This vintage Turkish edition was on sale for the better part of 100 dollars, which goes some ways towards explaining why I decided against starting a collection of these.\n\nMost Asian editions of the novel didn’t come out before the film, so those covers are overwhelmingly film-related, and not very interesting. An exception is this 1996 Thai version. Again, I think this this the sequel. Although the logo, the gate and the font are all there from the film, we do get some original, illustrated dinosaurs. I say “original”. Rather than Burian, the inspiration this time seems to have been John Sibbick, his highly recognizable T. rex and Velociraptor dutifully traced. I wish I had a higher resolution version of this one.\n\nAnd here’s the Dutch version that I promised you! I don’t mean to brag, but surely this is the king of weird vintage JP book covers? Look at that thing! What is even going on here? Is this made by someone who not only has never illustrated a dinosaur before, but never even seen a dinosaur before? What is going on with that arm? How does its neck work? Is that its back? Look at that five-fingered hand. Wait, which way does its knee bend? Is its leg backwards, or am I? What even is reality? Is that the face of 1998 Godzilla? I’m so confused. Please send help. Anyway, I have this one, so I can tell you who’s responsible. The image is credited to the brothers Schriemer who studied in the same town as me, so credit where credit is due. Er gaat niets boven Groningen. Five stars.",

    "fullText": "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-born TikTok star with the largest following on the platform, has struck a landmark commercial deal valued at approximately $900 million, marking one of the most significant monetisation moves ever by a global digital creator.\n\nThe transaction involves the partial sale of his company, Step Distinctive Limited, to Rich Sparkle Holdings, a United States-listed firm that disclosed the acquisition alongside a broader strategic partnership focused on scaling Lame’s commercial operations worldwide.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rich Sparkle, through its operating partners, will hold exclusive rights to Khaby Lame’s global commercial activities for an initial period of 36 months.\n\nThese rights cover brand partnerships, endorsements, licensing, and e-commerce ventures, signalling a shift from traditional influencer marketing to a platform-driven business model.\n\nRich Sparkle estimates that the integrated structure combining traffic, fulfilment, operations, and proprietary technology could eventually generate more than $4 billion in annual sales once fully implemented.\n\nAs part of the deal, Khaby Lame will become a controlling shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings, positioning him not just as a creative partner but as an equity stakeholder in the commercial infrastructure built around his brand.\n\n“This is not just an equity acquisition, but a revolution in the global content e-commerce model,” the company said, adding that the combination of a US-listed platform, globally recognised content IP, and supply chain expertise could unlock unprecedented shareholder value.\n\nThe rollout of the commercial strategy will initially focus on the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with execution planned over the next three years. Rich Sparkle will work with Anhui Xiaoheiyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based content commerce operator with experience in large-scale creator-led e-commerce.\n\nKhaby Lame rose to global prominence through silent, minimalist videos that humorously dismantle overly complicated life hacks. His wordless format has allowed him to transcend language barriers and build a vast, culturally diverse audience at remarkable speed.\n\nHe currently commands an estimated 360 million followers across social media platforms, making him one of the most influential digital figures in the world and a rare example of truly global creator reach.\n\nBeyond conventional commerce, the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\nRich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\nThe broader strategy also includes premium brand collaborations and co-branded intellectual property in sectors such as beauty, fragrance, and apparel, highlighting how creator influence is increasingly being transformed into long-term industrial-scale businesses.",

    "description": "More than 36,500 Iranians were killed by security forces during the January 8-9 crackdown on nationwide protests, making it the deadliest two-day protest massacre in history, according to documents reviewed by Iran International's Editorial Board.",
    "fullText": "For more than two weeks and counting, the country has existed inside a manufactured silence. The public internet, the basic infrastructure of modern life, has been reduced to rumor and fragments. What remains functional are the regime’s approved channels, whitelisted networks that keep the state connected to itself while cutting the country off from civic circulation.\n\nFrom outside Iran, this condition is often described as another episode of unrest. From inside, it feels closer to a new revolution that has already cost the country thousands of lives.\n\nIran has experienced a massacre and entered a post-massacre moment, a phase in which the state no longer performs restraint. It kills, buries, rewrites the narrative, and disconnects.\n\nThe blackout is not a byproduct of disorder. It is part of the machinery. Violence is easier to carry out when it is harder to document, and easier to deny when proof is delayed, partial, or erased.\n\nFrom the studio of The Program with Kambiz Hosseini, where Iranians have been calling into a live call-in program broadcast to Iran, the question no longer sounds abstract. It sounds prosecutorial.\n\nWhat, exactly, does the world believe it is watching?\n\nThe calls do not arrive as speeches. They arrive as exertion, as voices pushing through dead air and dropped connections.\n\nAli, calling from Mazandaran in northern Iran, addresses the security forces directly. “You do not need to put your weapon down. No one is afraid of you.” He repeats it, not as bravado, but as fact. Fear, he suggests, is no longer the organizing principle.\n\nPouria, calling from Shiraz in southern Iran, offers a different register. “We did not abandon a single wounded person, and we did not allow anyone to be left behind or written off.” The language is practical, almost logistical. It describes a moral line that held even as institutions collapsed. Do not leave anyone behind.\n\nBahram, from a working-class neighborhood in southern Tehran, explains why he went into the streets. “For my country, and for my children.” It is not an ideological statement. It is an intergenerational one.\n\nMahsa, from Najafabad, asks for something simpler. “I want to tell the story of my city.” The request itself is an indictment. In Iran today, telling the story of a place can be an act of defiance.\n\nFrom the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, Alia’s anger is controlled and unsentimental. “You thought we were afraid. We are not afraid. We are angry, and we are waiting.” She repeats it, sharpening the point. “They think we are afraid. We are not. We are angry, and we are waiting.” She does not ask to be comforted. She asks to be heard.\n\nThese voices share a quality that has become rare in authoritarian systems. They are unembellished. They do not seek spectacle. They insist on being recorded.\n\nThat insistence recalls the life of Raha Bohlouli-Pour, a university student who was shot and killed by Iranian security forces near Fatemi Square in Tehran on January 8, 2026. Raha, whose name in Farsi means free, was interested in art and music, according to her online profiles.\n\nShe was not an organizer or a public figure. She carried no slogans and belonged to no faction. In a political culture trained to search for enemies, she was unexceptional.\n\nRaha did not die because she exercised power or issued demands. She died because she embodied a way of being the state has learned to fear. Her generation does not aspire to heroic gestures or sacrificial myths. It seeks something quieter and more difficult to suppress, the right to live an ordinary life with dignity, continuity, and attention. To breathe without permission. To imagine tomorrow without explanation.\n\nShe left behind no manifesto. What remains are fragments, short reflections, carefully chosen lines. Her language returns again and again to elemental concerns, breathing, continuing, tomorrow. Even when fear appears, it is not dramatized. Her writing is restrained and lucid. If it is political, it is so in the most basic sense. It insists that being alive is not negotiable.\n\nOne detail matters. Raha wrote names. She named detainees and the missing. She recorded people as people, not as abstractions. She understood how repression begins, not with bullets, but with erasure. Violence becomes easier once names disappear and individuals dissolve into numbers.\n\nThat is why the callers matter. They produce the most destabilizing thing such a state can face, a record. Names. Places. Timelines. Descriptions of fear moving through neighborhoods, and of solidarity moving faster. Strangers pulling one another out of danger. Shopkeepers closing doors. Families taking risks that would be unthinkable in a normal society.\n\nNavid, a physician from Tehran, describes hospitals overwhelmed, security forces stationed inside wards, families pleading for information, and staff pushed beyond exhaustion into something closer to moral injury. He does not sound ideological. He sounds like someone trying, with diminishing success, to remain human inside a system designed to punish humanity.\n\nThe numbers, always and only the numbers, arrive as estimates.\n\nOne widely cited figure suggests the death toll may exceed twenty thousand. Whether the final count is higher or lower will matter to historians and prosecutors. The deeper point is simpler. The state has made counting dangerous, and then uses uncertainty as camouflage.\n\nThis is what post-massacre means.\n\nNot only that people have been killed, but that proving they were killed becomes a second battlefield.\n\nPeople no longer sound shocked. They sound worn down by the reliability of cruelty.\n\nIran today is no longer merely in internal crisis. When a government treats its own population as an enemy force, the consequences do not remain contained. They ripple outward through refugee flows, regional instability, and a precedent that other regimes quietly study.\n\nThe calls continue coming into the show. Not because a phone line can defeat a security apparatus, but because history is written by those who insist on being counted as human.\n\nThe state can disrupt the signal. It cannot fully erase the insistence.\n\nThat insistence, name by name and breath by breath, may be the most dangerous thing in Iran right now.\n\nWhat we are witnessing in Iran today can be categorized as a crime against humanity.",

    "title": "A developer teamed up with Claude to create Elo programming language",
    "description": "feature: Bernard Lambeau, the human half of a pair programming team, explains how he's using AI",
    "fullText": "feature Bernard Lambeau, a Belgium-based software developer and founder of several technology companies, created a programming language called Elo with the help of Anthropic's Claude Code.\n\nStarting on December 25, 2025, he published a series of posts about the project. The first post names Claude as a co-author.\n\n\"In roughly 24 hours of collaboration, we built a complete expression language with a parser, type system, three compilers, a standard library, a CLI tool, and a documentation website. Not bad for a day's work,” Lambeau and Claude wrote.\n\n\"Elo isn't just a demonstration that AI can write code. It's a demonstration that humans and AI can build together – each contributing what they do best,” they added.\n\nAs an expression language that compiles to JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL, Elo is intended as a portable way to handle form validation, e-commerce order processing, and subscription logic.\n\nLambeau, founder and CTO of Klaro Cards and CEO of app consultancy Enspirit, is not the first to develop a programming language with the help of AI.\n\nSteve Klabnik performed a similar feat last year with the Rue programming language. In September 2025, Geoffrey Huntley enlisted Claude to write a programming language called Cursed. And before that, Avital Tamir published a Claude-authored repo for the Server programming language, with the caveat that the code is not intended for actual use.\n\nClaude Code isn't the only AI-assisted programming method having a moment. AI biz Cursor created a rudimentary browser using OpenAI's GPT-5.2. And developer Ola Prøis used Cursor, powered by Claude, to create a Rust-based text editor called Ferrite.\n\nClaude users generally acknowledge that their pair partner makes mistakes. But those committed to AI assistance find it worthwhile to clean up after their helper.\n\n\"Claude Code knows almost every tech stack (and can search the web), knows the Linux commands that matter (search code, search & replace, compile, test, etc.), and does that 10x faster than I can do myself,\" Lambeau told The Register in an email interview.\n\nClaude, he said, allows him to use technology he hasn't mastered.\n\n\"I was already a full-stack developer (on languages, frameworks & reusable libraries I knew); I'm now a full-stack++ dev because I can also use languages, frameworks, and reusable libraries I barely know, if at all,\" he explained.\n\n\"Claude Code falls short if you don't have a great methodology. It needs feedback loops to work fine; otherwise, it derails. One possible feedback loop is a human reviewing code and testing manually. But there's a better/complementary approach if you want it to work autonomously. On both Elo and Bmg.js, I've started by making sure the testing methodology was effective and scientifically sound. Claude writes the tests, executes them, discovers where it's wrong, and corrects itself. Impressive.\"\n\nLambeau said he still needs to review some of Claude's output.\n\n\"But if I read the tests, agree with them, and can check myself that they run fine, I'm 95 percent sure it's already correct as a black box (not even reading the code),\" he explained. \"Then I can check the architecture and code quality as a white box by having a general look at the code, but I don't have to understand every detail.\"\n\nNotably, Lambeau documented the series of prompts he used to create the language. The repo includes more than 100 tasks used to direct the AI model. In addition, Lambeau has published a video that describes his AI pair programming process.\n\n\"I started in a setting where Claude Code asked for permissions every 20 seconds and I was checking everything it did,\" Lambeau explained. \"After a few successes, I quickly set up safe environments to be able to let Claude Code run in full autonomy (isolated computer & isolated Linux user, or running in a Docker image).\"\n\nLambeau said he still uses plan mode for complex tasks that require conversation with Claude.\n\n\"I review the plan, make sure we have a test strategy that's sound, then switch Claude to autonomous mode and look at the tests, code & results afterward,\" he said. \"That's very similar to a lead-dev/CTO + QA role, btw; it's just much faster than with human devs.\"\n\nLambeau, who has a PhD in software engineering and 30 years of experience as a developer, said both experts and novices can benefit from Claude Code, though he added that a service like Lovable might be more approachable for those not already acclimated to the command line.\n\n\"Now, when it comes to real software/product engineering, I think Claude Code requires experts (so far),\" he said. \"You still need to guide it a lot to keep the quality high enough. You need very strong expertise to do it effectively. Currently (Claude will still improve a lot), if you don't have the expertise, you certainly end up with a big mess of unmaintainable code.\"\n\nMany developers have said as much about AI tools. They're more useful as an amplifier of expertise than as a replacement for it. The situation is analogous to the introduction of sequencing software, digital synthesizers, and drum machines half a century ago. These tools enabled a lot of people who weren't great musicians to make music. But they didn't instill musical skill, and they produced the most interesting work in the hands of practiced musicians.\n\nThe cost to do this, Lambeau said, has been a Claude Max subscription that he purchased in December for €180 a month. In that time, he says, he wrote Elo (https://elo-lang.org), completed Bmg.js (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg.js), completed Bmg's documentation (https://www.relational-algebra.dev), and created the first version of the Try page (https://www.relational-algebra.dev/try).\n\n\"It's all personal research and open-source projects,\" he said. \"It would have required several weeks to do the same manually myself, and several months to ask another developer to do it. The cost would be mostly because of the scientific & technical knowledge transfer about the data language I envision. Strangely enough, it's very cheap with Claude Code. There's something true about the fact that those LLMs have a PhD.\"\n\nLambeau explained that Elo isn't just a way to test Claude Code. He also sees it as an extension of his academic work in software engineering and his personal interest in the Relational Model – he's served as a lecturer for database courses at Belgium’s UCLouvain.\n\n\"I'm absolutely convinced that we need better/safer/simpler programming languages inside no-code tools and when interconnecting them (e.g. Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.),\" he said. \"Mainstream programming languages are very complex, error-prone, sometimes dangerous, and the programs are difficult to review for non-experts.\"\n\n\"More importantly, they are cumbersome to use for even simple data tasks. I mean, even validating the schema and constraints of a data file at runtime tends to be a nightmare in existing languages. It's not built-in in any mainstream language; you immediately need validation libraries; most of them are limited in what they can easily check, so you need to add dedicated boilerplate code.\"\n\nIn a world where non-technical people will have the opportunity to write untrustworthy code with the help of AI, he said, we need to be able to run that code safely.\n\n\"Elo aims at providing a safe & simple alternative,\" he said. \"It will be a limited language (non-Turing-complete, as we say) but super safe & simple, and usable in 80 percent of common data use cases. The very first no-code tool to integrate it will be Klaro Cards, of course.\" ®",

One of those was Stripe’s\nBring Your Own Team (BYOT)\nconcept, which invited teams to apply together as a sort of light-weight\nacquihire approach.\n\nThe BYOT approach captured folks’ attention, but it was ultimately more effective\nas an idea showing Stripe’s originality rather than as a hiring practice. By the point\nthat I left, zero teams had been hired through the BYOT mechanism, although we did talk to some.\nOn the other hand, one of the hiring ideas that Stripe didn’t blog about publicly,\nbut worked extremely well in practice, is the idea of Lighthouse Hiring.\n\nLighthouse Hiring is the idea that hiring well-connected folks makes subsequent\nhires both easier and higher quality. Sure, hiring those well-known folks is\ndifficult, but if you’re trying to hire ten great people, then spending more\ntime hiring one “lighthouse hire” can improve the quality and velocity of the overall hiring push.\n\nA few examples of Stripe’s lighthouse hiring:\n\nThere are many other examples you could pick from, and importantly not all of them are widely-known,\njust widely-connected.\nJulia is a tech internet mainstay, but Raylene operated more from personal\nnetworks rather than social media networks. Any sort of high quality network\ncan be the underpinning of a successful lighthouse hire.\n\nThis mechanism worked exceptionally well, but there is a complex underside\nto Lighthouse Hires: strong networks, particularly publicly visible networks,\ncreate a complex power dynamic that some managers can struggle to navigate.\nIf you’re relying on a public personality, and they get frustrated at work,\nthen your lighthouse hiring strategy is going to implode on you.\nSimilarly, hiring them to begin with can be a challenge if\nyou don’t have an interesting role, but carving out a uniquely interesting\nrole for one hire will come across as biased internally, undermining your relationship\nwith the broader team.\n\nThese are all navigable, and I think Stripe would have been less successful\nif it hadn’t used this pattern, but it takes some nuance to deploy effectively.",

    "description": ": Deprecation of popular management tool requires a new look at Azure-based system",
    "fullText": "Microsoft recently announced it will deprecate System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) Management Packs (MPs) for SQL Server Reporting Services, Power BI Report Server,and SQL Server Analysis Services.\n\nWhile this affects a relatively small subset of SQL Server users, the move could force some organizations into monitoring solutions that expose their server deployments to Microsoft's licensing auditors, one analyst pointed out.\n\nThe affected SCOM management packs will remain available until January 2027, after which they'll no longer be supported. \"No new updates will be released, including no support for SQL Server 2025 or SCOM 2025,\" the notice said.\n\nMicrosoft said the products would no longer have official SCOM MPs for these products.\n\nSCOM is a popular management tool for Microsoft on-premises server product, supporting not just SQL Server, but also Exchange, Windows and SharePoint to manage updates, security changes, and patches.\n\nMicrosoft said the deprecation means existing management packs would continue to function in SCOM 2019 and SCOM 2022, but no new features, fixes, or security updates would be provided. And compatibility with later versions can not be guaranteed.\n\nThe software giant recommended affected users plan their migration to Azure-based monitoring solutions using Azure Monitor, Azure Arc and Log Analytics. This creates \"a unified alternative that offers centralized telemetry ingestion, alerting, performance monitoring, and dashboarding for hybrid and on‑premises environments,\" the vendor claimed.\n\nAndrew Snodgrass, analyst with Directions on Microsoft, said the Windows giant had ignored SCOM for a while, and he was advising clients to move away from it.\n\n\"Find a third party if you want to stay on-prem, but Microsoft's gonna start slowly killing this thing off the way they do,\" he told The Reg. With the alternative, customers can no longer download updates directly; they can only do it through Azure Arc, and in the process, they have to register their on-prem servers in Azure.\n\nSnodgrass said the Azure monitoring platform offered some \"really cool stuff\" for managing a SQL Server estate, especially hybrid users.\n\n\"What it requires is that – quite reasonably – you install an agent on your physical server or on your virtual server, whether that's in AWS, Azure or on-prem. This is the Azure Arc monitoring agent that is going to run locally, and it's going to connect up to Azure,\" he said.\n\nFrom a management point of view it works well, added Snodgrass, because admins can use a single Azure SQL management system and see all the servers and databases, regardless of their environment.\n\n\"But those who don't want to use Azure, or want to remain on-prem, will need to find an alternative local third-party management tool. SQL Server has been out for decades, so there's some really lovely management tools. There are also a few that will also manage your Windows Server and your Exchange servers as well.\"\n\nAlthough Microsoft has given no indication that the data could be used for anything other than software management, users should be aware that there is the potential for implications when it comes to license management.\n\n\"If you use the Azure SQL to manage all of these deployments, wherever they are, whether they're on prem or in AWS or Azure, then you're registering every one of your SQL Servers with Azure. That list is going to be out. Doesn't mean that Microsoft necessarily would, but if an audit comes along, they certainly could go out there and say, 'You know what, you've got this whole list here, and we look at the license count that you bought from us, and you don't have enough licenses to cover all these servers you've deployed',\" he said.\n\nOrganizations deliberately using unlicensed software do not have much of a defense, but there are grey areas, such as downloading SQL Server for software development using a Visual Studio license.\n\n\"If I were monitoring and managing all this stuff through the Azure tools, it can't delineate between production and development, and it would assume that all for those are production machines, and therefore I should buy licenses for them.\"\n\nSnodgrass advises clients to get a clear picture of the number of SQL Servers in production and those used for development before negotiating with Microsoft over licenses.\n\nThe Register has asked Microsoft to comment. ®",

    "description": "The USS Texas has endured a lot since it was commissioned in 1914, and 2026 will see it on display in refurbished condition in a brand-new location.",
    "fullText": "Though the American battleship has long since been overshadowed as the U.S. Navy's most prolific and strategically important warship by the aircraft carrier, World War II-era battleships will forever be a crucial part of naval history. Fortunately for fans of American military and naval history, there are several U.S. battleships open to the public across the United States, where these classic vessels can be toured and appreciated.\n\nThe first of these museum battleships was the USS Texas (BB-35), which has been owned and operated by the State of Texas as a memorial since the late 1940s. With a history that predates other battleships like the Missouri and Iowa, the Texas is America's only surviving warship to have fought in both World Wars. And now, after years of uncertainty, the future of this historic vessel is looking bright, with work underway to move the ship to a new permanent home at the Port of Galveston.\n\nAnd when the new and improved USS Texas Museum opens, it won't just be displayed as an old and dilapidated relic. Instead, it will be a ship that will have undergone a thorough and costly $75 million restoration process to bring it back to its full, period-correct, World War II glory.\n\nMost of America's battleship museums are ships of the Iowa Class, which were commissioned during World War II and served into the 1990s. The Texas represents a much older era of battleships that played a pivotal role in both major theaters of World War II. Commissioned in 1914 as one of the U.S. Navy's two New York-class ships (which the Scientific American referred to as \"super dreadnoughts\"), the Texas quickly went into service supporting American interests during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I, the Texas went to the North Sea, where it served as part of the historic Grand Fleet that oversaw the surrender of the Germans.\n\nThe Texas was modernized in the years between the wars, before again entering combat service in the Atlantic when World War II broke out. The USS Texas first supported the Allies during the North Africa campaign, then attacked German targets and supported the Allied Invasion force at Omaha Beach on D-Day in 1944. The ship would return to the U.S. for more modernizations before being sent to the Pacific Theater to fight the Japanese during the American invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\n\nFinally, the Texas ended its naval service by bringing American soldiers and sailors home during Operation Magic Carpet Ride in the months following the war. With newer battleships in the fleet and an increased focus on carriers, the aging ship was decommissioned and donated to the State of Texas in 1948.\n\nThe USS Texas was the first American battleship to become a permanent museum, located at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site. After decades on display and, with the ship's condition deteriorating, the Texas was moved to dry dock in 2022 to begin a series of repairs and renovations. Not only are these renovations addressing serious structural issues that would cause the ship to take on water, but the Texas is also receiving a full restoration with rebuilt structures, a new wooden deck, and fresh paint throughout to preserve the atmosphere of its combat days. So far, the process has required over 400,000 hours of labor, with over 700 tons of steel being replaced.\n\nWith the extensive four-plus-year restoration nearing completion at the start of 2026, the ship has secured its new home at Pier 15 in Galveston, where plans are underway for dredging, a permanent mooring, and brand new shoreside facilities to complete the museum. The Battleship Texas Foundation hopes to have the ship in place and the museum open to the public in late 2026 or early 2027. When the new and improved USS Texas Museum reopens, it will join the Aircraft Carrier USS Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi as one of the must-visit spots for military history on the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "A divorced parent explains why she buys duplicate clothes and personal care items so her kids feel settled while moving between homes.",
    "fullText": "After my divorce, my kids started living out of bags, going back and forth between my home and their dad's each week.\n\nIt's been like this for five years, but this school year added something new to the shuffle. My son and daughter, now 11 and 13, suddenly became interested in styling their hair every morning. They wanted specific hair care products and personal care items of their own.\n\nSuddenly, we weren't just packing clothes, shoes, school bags, and sports equipment; we were also packing hair products, favorite shampoos, perfumes, colognes, and body washes. I love when my home and bathroom smell like my kids' favorite scents, but practically speaking, it felt ridiculous to schlep all of it back and forth every week.\n\nThis winter, I started buying two of the special items they love, making the back-and-forth easier and easing some of the stress that comes with not having small comforts.\n\nI bought duplicate shampoos my daughter loves, one for my house and one for her dad's. I found a smaller, on-sale bottle of the Replica perfume she's obsessed with, so she could keep it with her. My son is really into his hair products, and I've started stocking up on those, along with the body washes he likes. He wanted a Versace cologne, so I bought a full-size bottle for my home and a travel-size version for him to bring with him.\n\nMy kids are also at the age where a random zit can feel like a crisis, so I bought each of them an extra moisturizer to help with blemishes, plus an extra box of pimple patches they can share at their other home. In a way, I hope these products are helpful when I'm not there to offer advice. As a worrier, it brings me relief knowing they have what they need wherever they are.\n\nAs a divorced parent, I've remained the default for buying clothes, shoes, school supplies, and now personal care items. I pay attention to what makes my kids feel confident. I often ask myself, would I want to go a full week without my favorite shampoo or hair product? Knowing they have the things they love, even in smaller or travel-size versions, makes me feel better no matter whose week it is.\n\nOf course, not everything can be duplicated. My son has one pair of Apple headphones that goes back and forth. My daughter's iPad travels with her. They each have a phone. The clothes they love are packed into reusable bags every week, along with three or four pairs of shoes. In cooler months, sweaters and jackets get added to the pile.\n\nPacking up their lives is exhausting. Sometimes I pack for them even though they're capable, because I understand the emotional weight of the divorced-kid routine. I wouldn't want to do what they do every week: loading bags with clothes, shoes, sports equipment, backpacks, Chromebooks, and then living out of them.\n\nI could coordinate more with their dad or create shared shopping lists, but our relationship didn't end well, and I'd rather limit contact. What matters most is that my kids have what they need without worry.\n\nOnce the car is loaded, I always tell them I'll see them soon. We share a moment, maybe a joke, a memory, a compliment, or something to look forward to. Watching the other door close always hurts. My love for them rises straight to my eyes. I take a deep breath as I walk back to my car. I miss them immediately, but knowing they have the things that make them feel good while we're apart warms my heart.",

    "description": "A federal immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday. He was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital.",
    "fullText": "America's largest network of labor unions has condemned ICE after a federal agent on Saturday shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, which represents nearly 15 million workers, called Pretti's death \"senseless.\"\n\n\"As tens of thousands of Minnesotans made clear peacefully and powerfully yesterday, the Trump administration's horrific operation — and their actions aimed at stoking violence and chaos — must end,\" the labor group said in a statement.\n\n\"America's unions join the call for ICE to immediately leave Minnesota before anyone else is hurt or killed. We demand local authorities conduct a full, transparent investigation that will lead to accountability for this tragic and violent act, and for Congress to use its power to hold ICE accountable.\"\n\nA federal agent fatally shot Pretti in Minneapolis, where he worked as an ICU nurse at a US Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Minneapolis police confirmed on Saturday that Pretti is a US citizen. He had been filming the agents when the confrontation began.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Border Patrol and ICE, said Pretti was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and \"approached\" agents at the scene. The department said officers tried to disarm Pretti, but he resisted. In multiple videos of the incident, however, Pretti is never seen threatening agents and is disarmed and subdued before he is shot. Minneapolis police said Pretti had a permit to carry the weapon.\n\nThe DHS deployed ICE and other federal agents to Minnesota as part of an immigration enforcement sweep called Operation Metro Surge, which began in December. The department says it has deployed around 2,000 federal agents across the state to detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump has made securing the border and deporting those in the US who lack proper paperwork a central part of his administration's agenda.\n\nLocal residents and business owners, however, have criticized the tactics federal agents are using to find and detain those people, resulting in protests across the state. Tensions further escalated after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, on January 7.\n\nThe CEOs of Minnesota's largest businesses, including Target, Cargill, Allianz, and UnitedHealth, called for \"immediate de-escalation\" in a joint statement on Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham shared a statement calling for a \"full and transparent investigation\" into the recent shootings.\n\n\"'Operation Metro Surge' is not and has never been about enforcing immigration law. This is about a President who is angry with the people of Minnesota for disagreeing with his policies and is weaponizing the federal government against us in retribution,\" Burnham said.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing Pretti and other federal workers in the US, also criticized the Trump administration in a statement on Saturday. As an employee of the VA hospital, Pretti was a member of AFGE Local 3669.\n\n\"While details of the incident are still emerging, one fact is already clear: this tragedy did not happen in a vacuum. It is the direct result of an administration that has chosen reckless policy, inflammatory rhetoric, and manufactured crisis over responsible leadership and de-escalation,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in the statement.\n\nKelley said the presence of federal agents has stoked fear and division in the community.\n\n\"I urge everyone to remain disciplined and measured in public, even as we are rightly angry. Still, we must do what we can to maintain peace and calm,\" Kelley said. \"But do not mistake restraint for acceptance. Accountability will come, and AFGE will not be silent about the policies and decisions that led us here.\"",

    "fullText": "The CEOs of Minnesota's most prominent businesses are calling for local, state, and federal officials to find a solution as tensions skyrocket the day after federal agents shot and killed a second person in Minneapolis.\n\nA Border Patrol agent killed Alex Pretti, 37, a US citizen who worked as a nurse at the local Veterans Affairs hospital, on Saturday morning. Pretti had been filming federal immigration agents when the confrontation began.\n\nMinneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been the site of continuous protests since the Department of Homeland Security flooded the cities with immigration agents in December. Tensions have been especially high since an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good on January 7.\n\nThe Minnesota Chamber of Commerce distributed a letter on Sunday signed by more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies calling for \"de-escalation.\"\n\nAmong the signatories were the leaders of major corporations: Target CEO Michael Fiddelke, 3M CEO William Brown, Allianz Life Insurance Company CEO Jasmine Jirele, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening, and UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley, among many others.\n\nThe letter called for an \"immediate de-escalation of tensions\" and for state, local, and federal officials to \"work together to find real solutions.\"\n\n\"In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state, and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,\" the letter says.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's immigration policies have long been the subject of sharp debate among business and tech leaders, many of whom have sought to curry favor during the president's second term.\n\nSome tech leaders, in fact, were at the White House on Saturday night to attend a screening of the new documentary about Melania Trump, which was produced by Melania Trump. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy were both expected to attend, according to multiple reports.\n\nMeanwhile, some employees at those companies and others are calling on their bosses to speak out against ICE actions across the country.\n\nA petition with over 250 signatures, titled \"Tech demands ICE out of our cities,\" a group of employees is calling on tech leaders to \"pick up the phone\" and call the White House to demand ICE \"leave our cities.\" They are also demanding that their companies cancel any contracts they have with ICE. The bulk of the signatories said in the petition that they worked for Amazon and Google.\n\nAfter the latest fatal shooting in Minneapolis, some business and tech leaders themselves took to social media to say their piece.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund owner Bill Ackman called for calm while blaming Minnesota state officials for provoking the violence.\n\nJames Dyett, an exec at OpenAI, criticized the tech community for not speaking up. \"There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,\" Dyer wrote on X. \"Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.\"",

    "fullText": "Former Vice President Al Gore was characteristically calm yet blunt during a conversation with Bloomberg News about the global energy transition at a major gathering of world leaders this week.\n\nEach year, the World Economic Forum hosts world leaders, academics, scientists, and business executives in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThat event — dubbed simply \"Davos\" in the media — kicked off on Jan. 19 with the theme \"A Spirit of Dialogue\" for 2026.\n\nFinancial news outlet Bloomberg has long covered the annual forum in Davos, establishing \"Bloomberg House\" in 2024 for in-depth discussions, like its sit-down with the former vice president.\n\nGore has long been known for his ecological focus, and 2026 marked 20 years since the release of Gore's book and follow-up film, \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" Both warned that inaction on environmental issues would be costly and deadly.\n\nGore now chairs sustainable investment firm Generation Investment Management, and he was direct in his criticism of the United States' sharp turn away from the clean energy transition.\n\nPrivate equity firm chair and Bloomberg personality David Rubenstein spoke with Gore and asked why in-progress wind farm projects had been halted in the U.S., particularly amid soaring energy prices.\n\nGore, a staid, dutiful foil to his charismatic running mate, former President Bill Clinton, didn't pull punches about the inevitability of transitioning to renewable energy.\n\nHe told Rubenstein that renewables were \"taking over\" worldwide while the U.S. canceled projects nearing completion.\n\n\"We really don't have any choice about this,\" Gore said of the global future of energy, a sentiment that echoed a recent statement by International Renewable Energy Agency director-general Francesco La Camera.\n\nShould the U.S. invest \n\nIt should be private investments\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIn a Jan. 18 report ahead of Davos, Bloomberg reported that the WEF had agreed to \"downplay\" discussion of rising temperatures and other topics considered agitating to the federal government in an effort to secure American participation.\n\nHowever, as Davos convened in Switzerland, political discourse in the U.S. was heavily focused on the cost of basic energy necessities, such as heat and electricity.\n\nActive lawmakers and candidates were often forced to discuss the issue through a lens of current policy or constituent outrage, whereas Gore was under no such constraints.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Gore emphasized that solar and wind were the \"cheapest forms of electricity\" today, an accurate statement that was also consequential as a large share of American homes struggled to afford utilities.\n\nSolar and wind are also widely confirmed to be faster to build than another popular carbon-pollution-reducing solution, nuclear — and even if land acquisition can sometimes be more straightforward for nuclear, the impact on the neighboring towns, including emergency protocols, is far more serious for nuclear than renewable development.\n\nIn November, lawmakers issued an urgent plea to utility providers as more households fell behind and faced shutoffs, and as data center expansion continued to spike costs.\n\nGore's assertion that the U.S. couldn't opt out of the clean energy transition was bolstered by some recent news on that front.\n\nIn January, a district court judge ruled that the federal government acted unlawfully in canceling nearly $8 billion in clean energy projects.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "One week ago, Destiny Jackson spoke with CNN about her family of eight getting tear gassed in Minneapolis while stopped on their way home from her son’s basketball game on January 14.\n\nThe family says they did not realize an anti-ICE protest was happening around them when they first reached the scene. Video from the scene showed her children rushing out of the car and into a nearby house for safety, on the same night a federal agent shot a man in the leg.\n\nIt was one of several interviews Jackson had done that week with different news outlets. Someone asked her to make a GoFundMe, so she did, she said — and donations poured in, raising more than $170,000 in all.\n\nSince then, Jackson tells CNN she has faced online attacks by far-right social media users and select media publications.\n\nThat’s partly because, since CNN published the story, a one-hour-and-36-minute livestream from that evening has surfaced, which was first reported by Crime Watch Mpls and then covered by the Daily Mail, that shows Jackson at the actual protest itself without her children – at one point, making an inflammatory comment on camera.\n\nBut that’s also because Jackson has a past criminal record.\n\nIn two interviews with CNN on January 23 and 24, Jackson explained more about why she was seen at the protest in the livestream and addressed her previous criminal charges.\n\nIn her January 17 interview with CNN, Jackson said she had retrieved her mother from the protest before getting back into her vehicle with her six kids and husband to leave the area.\n\nThat’s when she says she heard commotion from the protest and told her husband to drive away, but said they were blocked in and couldn’t get out. From there, a tear gas canister rolled under her car and exploded.\n\nIn the newly surfaced video, she and her husband appear in and out of frame at or near the protest for at least 45 minutes.\n\nJackson explained she and her husband were driving home from her son’s basketball game when they noticed the road ahead was blocked off. Cars were coming from every direction, while some cars were parked on the street, so they pulled over to allow cars to pass, she said.\n\nHer husband wanted to know what was happening, so he got out of the car to ask around. From the passenger seat, Jackson says she coincidentally noticed her mother, her mother’s boyfriend and a family friend crossing the street. She called out to them and they came to talk to her, explaining they were headed to a protest.\n\nShortly after, her family friend came back to the car because it was too cold. At that point, Jackson said she didn’t want her mom to be at the protest because she was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure, so she walked to the protest to try to get her mother to leave. Her family friend, whom she refers to as “auntie,” stayed in the car to watch Jackson’s children.\n\nJackson said she was trying to get her mom to leave the entire time she was at the demonstration, but added she also talked to people while she was there. Her husband is just “nosy,” and wanted to see what was happening, she said.\n\nIn recent interviews with CNN, she explained she had been able to leave before the situation turned heated, but she had not wanted to because she was focused on her mother. It was when the situation escalated that her family’s vehicle became trapped and they couldn’t get out of the area, Jackson said.\n\nAlthough CNN cannot independently confirm that Jackson’s vehicle was trapped when the protest escalated, Minnesota Attorney General Ellison previously told CNN the family was “caught in the middle of” the situation.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin also said in an email to CNN on January 16: “This family was the victim of rioters and agitators whose lawless behavior is encouraged by Minnesota’s top leaders.”\n\nAbout 10 minutes before the livestream captured what appears to be flash bangs going off, Jackson is seen in the video talking to a friend in a car, away from the demonstration.\n\nThe livestreamer comes up to the two of them, and in response to a prompt from the livestreamer, Jackson says: “We’re going to kill these motherf**kers.”\n\nThe livestreamer responds: “No you not, no she not.”\n\nIt’s unclear, from the video alone, what Jackson meant.\n\n“Shooting and killing people is unacceptable, that was completely taken out of context,” Jackson said to CNN.\n\nShe explained the livestreamer had been talking about guns and weapons, so she claims she was sarcastically asking him if he was going to kill federal agents.\n\n“I was like sarcastically asking him that … I wasn’t saying we’re going to like, that we were gonna kill ICE, no,” she said.\n\nAbout three minutes after Jackson’s comment in the livestream, her husband is seen standing in a crowd of protesters who were chanting, “Pigs, go home.” He is not seen chanting with the protesters in the livestream.\n\nA few minutes later, what appear to be flash-bang devices start to go off and the crowd disperses.\n\nJackson is seen in the passenger seat of her car a few minutes later, recording on her phone. A few seconds later, it appears that a tear gas canister goes off near her vehicle.\n\nJackson tells CNN that they couldn’t move their car once the demonstration near them escalated.\n\nA tear gas canister rolled under the family’s car and exploded underneath it, she said. Bystanders helped her get her children out of the car, with her 6-month-old being the last to make it out.\n\nShe said she gave the baby mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while people poured milk on her other children’s eyes because of the tear gas.\n\nJackson said she went to the hospital with her baby and two of her children, who have severe asthma.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis said in a statement the tear gas caused “a 6-month-old infant inside the vehicle to experience breathing difficulties,” according to initial reports.\n\nWhen police and the fire department were able to reach the family, “the infant was breathing and stable, but (in) serious condition,” according to the statement.\n\nAs of Saturday, Jackson and her baby are still dealing with congestion from the tear gas, she said, with her baby taking medication to clear his airways.\n\nCritics are upset that Jackson is collecting money on a GoFundMe after getting tear gassed given her criminal record, she tells CNN.\n\nCourt records show Jackson agreed to plead guilty to “aiding an offender – accomplice after the fact” in June 2021. In the same case, she was also charged with murder, but the charges were later dismissed, according to a court document.\n\nJames Moore, who Jackson says was her boyfriend at the time, was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to intentional second-degree murder in 2020, according to a Hennepin County Attorney’s Office statement.\n\nMoore fatally shot a man who was lured to an apartment to sell marijuana in an apparent robbery gone wrong, the statement says. Moore and another man ran into Jackson’s apartment after the shooting.\n\nA witness said it was Jackson who lured the man by creating a fake Facebook message, according to the statement and a criminal complaint. From there, Moore and another man “had devised a plan to rob (the victim) when he arrived,” the prosecutor’s statement says.\n\nHowever, Jackson was only convicted of “aiding an offender – accomplice after the fact.”\n\n“I had nothing to do with anybody being killed,” Jackson tells CNN, explaining that the accomplice after-the-fact charge was based on the fact that the men fled to her apartment after the killing. Jackson also claims she was not the person to write the Facebook message, explaining she gave her boyfriend access to her account.\n\n“Now that (I’m) an adult and all that stuff, like we don’t share our passwords and stuff with people,” she said.\n\nShe was sentenced to 28 days in jail, which she had already served at the time, and five years of probation, according to court records. She tells CNN she has a few months left of her probation.\n\nShe believes if she had never made a GoFundMe, she doesn’t think so much “negativity” about her story would have surfaced.\n\n“What happened to us was traumatic, you know, in our mind, we feel so guilty … yes, I probably should have left sooner than we did,” she said. “It’s very traumatizing, like the things that we went through and the things that people are saying.”",

    "description": "While there are many surprisingly hidden costs in your tax years during retirement, several types of retirement income aren't taxable.",
    "fullText": "One of the most overlooked aspects of retirement planning is the effect that federal income taxes or state income taxes have on someone trying to live on a fixed income. They can take a big bite out of your retirement savings if you’re not prepared.\n\nThe good news for your nest egg is that not all retirement income is taxable. By understanding which sources of income are tax-free in 2026, you can create a smarter retirement strategy and keep more of your hard-earned money. Here are six types of retirement income that won’t get taxed, and how to make the most of them.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid taxes on your retirement money is to use a Roth account. Both IRA and 401(k) plans can be structured as Roth accounts, which don’t offer a tax deduction on contributions but allow tax-free withdrawals after age 59 ½.\n\nEssentially, with a Roth account, you’re paying your taxes upfront at the time that you contribute, rather than owing them on your distributions. While you can’t contribute to a Roth if your income exceeds certain levels, you can convert your traditional plan to a Roth at any time. However, you’ll have to pay income taxes on the amount of the conversion, just as if you withdrew the money.\n\nTrending Now: Here’s What Retirees Wasted the Most Money On in 2025 — and How To Avoid It in 2026\n\nUp Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nFor this reason, it typically makes more sense to start a Roth earlier in your career rather than facing a huge tax bill during your peak earning years. For example, a $1 million portfolio in a 401(k) plan or traditional IRA might be worth $800,000 or less after taxes. Similarly, if your investments are in a regular, taxable brokerage account, the income that money generates may also be taxable.\n\nIt’s not usually a good idea to rely on an inheritance as a retirement plan. For starters, receiving an inheritance is never a sure thing, and additionally, the amount bequeathed is rarely enough to fund a long retirement.\n\nHowever, many Americans do receive an inheritance at some point in their lives, and it can often be a good supplement to existing retirement savings. Financially speaking, the best part of an inheritance is that it is tax-free, so long as you don’t live in Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which still impose inheritance taxes.\n\nThough some states do impose an estate tax, that money will come out of the inheritance and not your personal funds.\n\nMunicipal bonds are issued by states, cities and various localities, generally to fund projects like schools, roads and other items that are for the common good. Municipal bonds are granted tax relief at the federal level, meaning investors don’t have to pay federal taxes on the interest earned from any municipal bond.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Ca.) declared Sunday he’s “not giving ICE or Border Patrol another dime given how these agencies are operating” as deadly sweeping Immigration and Custom Enforcement raids led by the Trump administration have sparked political and public backlash.\n\nAppearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Schiff made the statement after moderator Kristen Welker asked him if he’s “prepared to vote against Department of Homeland Security funding if it means partially shutting down the government, again, coming on the heels of an incredibly long shutdown.”\n\nPolitics: Democrats Consider Partial Government Shutdown To Curb ICE\n\nTelling Welker straight up that “Democrats are not going to fund that,” he continued, “The government will shut down if Republicans insist that that be joined with other government funding. It will be a Republican decision. They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”\n\nThe California senator noted Democrats are hoping “some of the Republicans in the Senate may see those scenes in the streets and be as repelled as we are, and vote against that continuation of violence also.”\n\nHe added: “If they don’t, it will be their decision whether they couple that funding for these ICE agents and Border Patrol agents with all these other government agencies.”\n\n“[Republicans] will make the decision. They’re in the majority if they want to shut down the government so they can perpetuate this violence,” Schiff said.\n\nPolitics: Sworn Witness Accounts Of Alex Pretti Killing Differ Sharply From DHS\n\nSchiff went on to vow he’s “not going to be a part of it.”\n\n“And I think anyone who votes to give them more money to do this will share in the responsibility and see more Americans die in our cities as a result.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker asked Schiff what the “exact impact” would be if legislators withhold funding now, considering “Republicans have already passed $170 billion in extra DHS funding through what they’ve dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Well, it would certainly, I hope, stop it from becoming even worse,” he responded. “They have thrown so much money at these agencies. They don’t know what to do with it. And there is no question that when we actually get a chance to do oversight again, which I hope will happen after this November, you are going to find all kinds of corruption [with] how that money is going out.”\n\nPolitics: House Passes Bill Funding ICE — With Help From Democrats\n\nSchiff then told Welker he believes they will find that the money has been “wasted hand over fist.”\n\n“There is going to be enormous waste, fraud and abuse in DHS given how money is being spent without any kind of real oversight,” he said.\n\nWatch Schiff’s interview on “Meet the Press” below.\n\nTrump Takes Aim At ‘Corrupt’ Adam Schiff As Next Target In His Political Retribution Tour\n\nAdam Schiff Calls Out Trump For 'Flip-Flopping' On Abortion\n\nRep.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities unveiled a new mural on a giant billboard in a central Tehran square on Sunday with a direct warning to the United States to not attempt a military strike on the country, as U.S. warships head to the region.\n\nThe image shows a bird's-eye view of an aircraft carrier with damaged and exploding fighter planes on its flight deck. The deck is strewn with bodies and streaked with blood that trails into the water behind the ship to form a pattern reminiscent of the stripes of the American flag. A slogan is emblazoned across one corner: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.”\n\nThe unveiling of the mural in Enghelab Square comes as the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and accompanying warships move toward the region. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action.\n\n“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction and maybe we won’t have to use it,” Trump said Thursday.\n\nEnghelab Square is used for gatherings called by the state and authorities change its mural based on national occasions. On Saturday, the commander of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard warned that his force is “more ready than ever, finger on the trigger.”\n\nTension between the U.S. and Iran has spiked in the wake of a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that saw thousands of people killed and tens of thousands arrested. Trump had threatened military action if Iran continued to kill peaceful protesters or carried out mass executions of those detained.\n\nThere have been no further protests for days and Trump claimed recently that Tehran had halted the planned execution of about 800 arrested protesters — a claim Iran’s top prosecutor called “completely false.”\n\nBut Trump has indicated he is keeping his options open, saying on Thursday that any military action would make last June’s U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites “look like peanuts.”\n\nU.S. Central Command said on social media that its Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle now has a presence in the Middle East, noting the fighter jet “enhances combat readiness and promotes regional security and stability.”\n\nSimilarly, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Thursday that it deployed its Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar “in a defensive capacity.”\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, which does not tolerate dissent.\n\nThe death toll reported by activists has continued to rise since the end of the demonstrations, as information trickles out despite a more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in Iran’s history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Sunday put the death toll at 5,848, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,280 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "description": "Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin says he thinks Franklin County has never seen a real level 3 snow emergency before.",
    "fullText": "Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin said the level 3 snow emergency declared Jan. 25 appears to be the first in the county's history, and it could continue into Jan. 26.\n\nBaldwin told The Dispatch that the roads in Franklin County are closed to all except emergency personnel and people who must travel for essential work, including hospital and airport employees.\n\nOngoing extreme cold temperatures will make road treatments less effective, so it's possible the level 3 snow emergency could remain in place for a while, Baldwin said.\n\n\"The roads are white,\" Baldwin said in an interview with the Dispatch at 12:30 p.m. Jan. 25. \"They're totally snow covered. Some of the roads are not bad ... Some are just absolutely horrible.\"\n\nBaldwin's office later issued a press release clarifying the level 3 status.\n\n\"This is not an automatic enforcement action in which drivers are stopped and cited simply for being onthe road,\" the release said. \"Deputies and police officers use discretion when encountering motorists. Those who have a legitimate and necessary reason to travel should not fear immediate citation or arrest. However, individuals traveling without an acceptable reason during a Level 3 Snow Emergency may be subject to arrest.\"\n\nBaldwin said he doesn't believe a level 3 snow emergency has been called in Franklin County before. He said this is because Franklin County has \"so many resources\" and is usually able to clear roads quickly.\n\nThe sheriff's office later clarified that in the early 2000s, former Sheriff Jim Karnes accidentally declared a level 3 emergency due to a miscommunication.\n\nBaldwin placed the county under a level 3 snow emergency at 11:37 a.m. Jan 25. Snow emergencies are set by local sheriffs and remain in place until they are lifted.\n\nBaldwin said he will lift the emergency when he has heard from the Ohio Department of Transportation and the city that the roads are safe.\n\nBaldwin said he was out driving on the roads the morning of Jan. 25. As noon approached, he saw more and more regular vehicles out, and some of them were struggling in the snow.\n\n\"If the regular motorists can't get by, then the snowplows can't get by,\" Baldwin said. \"If they can't get by, the fire trucks, our cruisers can't respond.\"\n\nBaldwin said the level 3 snow emergency will remain in place until the main roads in the county are cleared. It's difficult to say how long that will take because snow is still coming down, he added. The National Weather Service forecasts snow into the night, with flurries still possible after 10 p.m.\n\n\"If we're just able to stay off of the road and let the snowplows do their job, then we can all get back on the road quicker,\" Baldwin said.\n\nBaldwin said the main purpose of the snow emergency is to keep people off the roads who do not need to be traveling. He hopes central Ohioans heed the emergency's warning.\n\n\"The main message is to keep people safe. Just stay home and enjoy the day,\" Baldwin said.\n\nPublic Safety and Breaking News Reporter Bailey Gallion can be reached at bagallion@dispatch.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Is it legal to drive during level 3 snow emergency in Franklin County?",

    "description": "Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is calling for the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, saying that she believes Noem is attempting to \"mislead the American public” about the fatal shooting of a 37 year-old protester in Minneapolis.  The call from Rosen, a moderate from Nevada who was part of the group that helped Republicans end the 43-day government shutdown last year, comes amid a growing fury from congressional Democrats who have also vowed to block funding for the Homeland Security Department.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is calling for the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, saying that she believes Noem is attempting to \"mislead the American public” about the fatal shooting of a 37 year-old protester in Minneapolis.\n\nThe call from Rosen, a moderate from Nevada who was part of the group that helped Republicans end the 43-day government shutdown last year, comes amid a growing fury from congressional Democrats who have also vowed to block funding for the Homeland Security Department. A House resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against Noem has the support of more than 100 Democrats, but few Senate Democrats have so far weighed in.\n\n“Kristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year — and the abuses of power we’re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Rosen said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nRosen said Noem's conduct is “deeply shameful” and she \"must be impeached and removed from office immediately.”\n\nImpeachment proceedings are unlikely in the GOP-controlled Congress, but mounting Democratic outrage over the violence in the streets of Minneapolis is certain to disrupt Senate Republican leaders’ hopes this week to quickly approve a wide-ranging spending bill and avoid a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30.\n\nAnd while some moderate Democrats have been wary over the last year of criticizing the Trump administration on border and immigration issues, the fatal shootings in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7 have transformed the debate, even among moderates like Rosen.\n\nThe senator's call for impeachment followed Noem’s quick defense, without a full investigation, of the fatal shooting of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti as he “approached” them with a gun. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but he appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos.\n\nDuring the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and opened fire with several shots, including into his back. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon.\n\nNoem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”\n\n“This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” Noem said Sunday.\n\nIn her call for Noem's impeachment, Rosen cited other issues beyond the current ICE operations. She said Noem has also “violated the public trust by wasting millions in taxpayer dollars” on self promotion and cited reports that the Coast Guard purchased her two luxury jets worth $172 million.\n\nRosen’s statement follows that of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is one of the more left-leaning members of the Senate Democratic caucus. Markey said last week that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against Noem, “who is right now actually orchestrating on the streets of our country this almost vigilantism on the part of ICE agents terrorizing cities all across the country.”\n\nAnd while other senators stopped short of calling for Noem's impeachment, several moderate Democrats who joined Rosen in voting to reopen the government last year said they would vote against Homeland Security funding this week even if it meant a government shutdown.\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that DHS is “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said that “we are not living in normal times.”\n\nAs administration officials immediately defended the shooting, several Republicans have called for a thorough investigation, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.\n\nHouse Democrats increasingly back Noem's impeachment\n\nCalls for Noem’s impeachment also grew louder in the House as the Democratic caucus had a phone call with Minnesota’s Gov. Tim Walz and the state’s Attorney General Keith Ellison, both former congressmen, according to a person familiar with the private call who requested anonymity to discuss it.\n\nMost of the House Democratic lawmakers who spoke during the meeting called for Noem's impeachment, said another person familiar with the call who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.\n\nNew York Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat who was one of only seven House Democrats who voted to fund the Homeland Security Department last week, said Sunday that “there must be accountability, which is why Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately.”\n\n“She is not focused on safety or border security; she’s focused on chaos and self-promotion, undermining local law enforcement and stoking violence as a result,” Gillen said in a post on X.\n\nAP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Just 254 days ago Crystal Palace were flying high.\n\nCaptain Marc Guehi held the FA Cup aloft at Wembley - the club's first major trophy after upsetting Manchester City in the final - and Oliver Glasner was already making plans for a European campaign.\n\nBut so much has changed since that glorious afternoon.\n\nMatch-winner Eberechi Eze was sold to Arsenal in the summer, Guehi moved to Manchester City, while Glasner himself announced he will be leaving when his contract expires at the end of the season and talisman Jean-Philippe Mateta told the club he wants to leave.\n\nResults have also taken a downward turn, with Palace failing to win any of their past 11 games across all competitions - the longest current winless run of any Premier League side - including losing at non-league Macclesfield in the FA Cup.\n\nSunday's 3-1 home loss by Chelsea extended their winless league run to eight matches, with six ending in defeat, and left them 15th in the table and eight points clear of third-bottom West Ham.\n\nPalace ended the match with 10 men after midfielder Adam Wharton - another player linked with an exit - was sent off after receiving two yellow cards.\n\n\"Confidence is what you get from results,\" Glasner told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"It is my job, my responsibility, with my staff, my group, to get this confidence back. I saw a lot of positives, but when you are losing 3-1 and have not won for 11 games then it's completely right to say, 'where are the results?'\n\n\"That's what we have to get. It is up to us to find these puzzle pieces. There's no magician. I always believe in this group, these players, that we will turn it around.\"\n\nDespite Palace's poor form, they are still one point better off than at this stage last season and can book a spot in the last 16 of the Conference League if they come through a two-legged play-off against Zrinjski Mostar from Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n\"These are tough moments, tough games,\" added Glasner.\n\n\"I look at the team and 3-0 down, a red card, you can go out five or six-nil, but we came back, scored a goal and made a fight of it, so that shows the great character of the group and that gives me a lot of confidence this group will turn it around.\"",

Big, big positive energy,\" Rohl said.\n\n\"Danilo scored, this is great, Gassama scored. All the subs tried and helped the team. It was again a great team performance. It feels great with eight wins [in a row in all competitions].\n\n\"It's a statement, especially from the point we were at. I spoke about being a hunter and this is still where we are. We want to hunt. We want to be on front foot.\n\n\"We want to win our games. If you do this, then in the next 15 games there is a big opportunity there. It's still hard work to do. It's not easy to win games in this league. If you hunt, you can be successful.\"",

    "fullText": "When Tomas Cvancara stretched his neck and planted a header on Craig Gordon's crossbar an hour into this exhilarating clash of the champions and the wannabe champions, a sense of shock swept around Tynecastle.\n\nCvancara? Was he still out there? You could have been forgiven for thinking not. For an hour he'd been little more than a keen if ill-fitting presence in the Celtic attack.\n\nHis lack of goal threat was hardly a surprise given he has scored just three times in the 43 games he had played before this one. His lack of impact was no great sensation either given he hadn't played a competitive minute since late November.\n\nThe fact he was still on the pitch was a little odd because the game had passed him by, but that header showed there was life in the new boy.\n\nMore life than Hearts had bargained for. Minutes later, he tore away down the left, leaving Craig Halkett trailing behind. His delivery to Yang Hyun-jun was precise and against the flow of the game Celtic were back in front.\n\nTynecastle rubbed its eyes and then girded its loins. In those seconds, a compelling game became a total belter; thrilling, controversial, exhausting and invigorating.\n\nGoals, aggravation, a red card that infuriated the visitors and opened a door for the hosts, a toe-to-toe fight that went to the wire.\n\nIt wasn't so much the bitter cold that caused the shivers at Tynecastle, it was the mad drama of the clash, the intensity and edge-of-the-seat fury of it all.",

    "fullText": "Sunday's win at Arsenal was another unbelievable result for Manchester United and I was hugely impressed with the way they got it.\n\nJust like in last weekend's Manchester derby, ultimately this victory came down to the fact that their big players are turning up for them now. For example, when you go down the spine of the United team at Emirates Stadium, they all looked like the players we know they are.\n\nHarry Maguire was brilliant at the back, then you had Casemiro in the middle of the park, using all his experience. Bruno Fernandes, back in his favourite position as a number 10, was outstanding, and up front Bryan Mbeumo was a goal threat, but also able to hold the ball up, and scared people with his pace and energy.\n\nUnited scored two brilliant goals, but their victory did not rely on outstanding individual performances or moments.\n\nInstead, the whole team played their part in this win, and manager Michael Carrick deserves credit for finding a way of making that happen.",

The pressure was on Arsenal today,\" former Manchester United captain Roy Keane said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"They'll have seen the other results, they're in a great position, they've got everything going for them... but it's pressure.\n\n\"They're feeling the pressure and it's how they deal with it over the next month or two. That's what's cost them over the last few years.\n\n\"I can't believe they don't look like a confident team for where they are in the league. They've got to get back to basics and start embracing this challenge instead of being frightened of it.\"\n\nTop of the table and with everything in their hands, the Gunners have been here before.

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick is far too experienced to get coaxed into giving away whether he wants to become Manchester United's next permanent manager.\n\nHe is happier revealing his kids were in the away section at Emirates Stadium, joining the throng in a bout of unbridled glee when Matheus Cunha scored United's brilliant third and then again when the whistle went to confirm a 3-2 victory, their first win at Arsenal in eight years.\n\nWe cannot know whether Carrick's two children were among those still singing in Carrick's honour 15 minutes after the final whistle. But given the collective noise being made by the 3,000-strong visiting support, they probably were.\n\nMinority United owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe looked pleased enough in the directors' box. There have not been many moments to smile about in the two years he has been running the football side at Old Trafford. This certainly was one.\n\nUnited have marked Carrick's first two matches in charge with successive wins. It was something Ruben Amorim managed once in his 14-month tenure - as part of a run of three successes earlier this season that earned him the October manager of the month award.\n\nUnited have amassed six points under Carrick. It took Amorim five games to get to seven - and he lost the next three matches.\n\nUnited have taken twice as many points from their past two games - against the teams first and second in the table - as they collected from the three before that, against Leeds, Wolves and Burnley, three of the current bottom five.\n\nSix weeks ago, hardly anyone would have chosen Carrick as United's next manager in preference to Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner.",

    "fullText": "Ted Cruz trashed President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in conversations with GOP donors last year, explosive leaked recordings allege.\n\nThe Texas senator, expected to run for president in 2028, slammed Trump’s tariff crusade and said he even threatened his staff with immediate firing if they used the phrase “Liberation Day” to refer to the day the sweeping taxes were announced, reports Axios.\n\nCruz, 55, told donors he and other senators expressed their tariff disgust with Trump in a lengthy phone call, warning it would tank the economy and lead to his impeachment. The call pushed past midnight and “did not go well,” Cruz told donors, with Trump “yelling” and “cursing” at the lawmakers.\n\nCruz claims that he received an especially explicit response from the president that night.\n\n“Mr. President, if we get to November of [2026] and people’s 401(k)s are down 30% and prices are up 10–20% at the supermarket, we’re going to go into Election Day, face a bloodbath,” Cruz told Trump, according to the recording. “You’re going to lose the House, you’re going to lose the Senate, you’re going to spend the next two years being impeached every single week.”\n\nTrump allegedly responded bluntly: “‘F--- you, Ted.’”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCruz’s office did not deny the contents of the recordings in a statement to Axios. Still, Cruz’s office claimed that he is still “the president’s greatest ally in the Senate and battles every day in the trenches to advance his agenda.”\n\nAxios reports that the recordings were “nearly 10 minutes in total” and came from conversations in “early and middle 2025.” The site said the recordings were provided by a “Republican source.”\n\nIt is unclear which donors Cruz was speaking to.\n\nTrump referred to Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and even went as far as suggesting that his wife, Heidi, is ugly compared to Melania. Still, Cruz has largely done Trump’s bidding in the Senate ever since, and he even campaigned for him in 2024.\n\nCruz, 55, is now believed to be eyeing another White House run, hoping to become a more traditional GOP successor to Trumpism. Standing in his way is the 41-year-old Vance, who is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination in the eyes of prediction markets.\n\nVance was “torched” by Cruz in the secret recordings, Axios reported. Sources also told The Washington Post last month that Cruz privately badmouths the VP to donors.\n\nIn the recordings obtained by Axios, Cruz claimed that Vance was a “pawn of conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson,” who is among Cruz’s biggest foes, having clashed with the ex-Fox News host in an explosive interview last summer over the Trump administration’s strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Cruz supported the intervention and has repeatedly criticized Carlson for his opposition to U.S. military support of Israel.\n\n“Tucker created JD,” Cruz told donors, according to Axios. “JD is Tucker’s protégé, and they are one and the same.”\n\nPublicly, Cruz has never explicitly linked Vance and Carlson. He alleged to donors that the ousted National Security Adviser Mike Waltz—of Signalgate infamy—was pushed out of Trump’s Cabinet by Carlson and Vance.\n\n“[He] supported being vigorous against Iran and bombing Iran—and Tucker and JD took Mike out,” Cruz said, according to Axios.\n\nCarlson told Axios he had nothing to do with the high-profile ouster.",

    "fullText": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that a U.S. security guarantees document for Ukraine is “100% ready” after two days of talks involving representatives from Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Vilnius during a visit to Lithuania, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is waiting for its partners to set a signing date, after which the document would go to the U.S. Congress and Ukrainian parliament for ratification.\n\nZelenskyy also emphasized Ukraine’s push for European Union membership by 2027, calling it an “economic security guarantee.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader described the talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as likely the first trilateral format in “quite a long while” that included not only diplomats but military representatives from all three sides. The talks, which began on Friday and continued Saturday, were the latest aiming to end Russia’s nearly four-year full-scale invasion.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged fundamental differences between Ukrainian and Russian positions, reaffirming territorial issues as a major sticking point.\n\n“Our position regarding our territory — Ukraine’s territorial integrity — must be respected,” he said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed a Ukraine settlement with U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner during marathon talks late Thursday. The Kremlin insisted that to reach a peace deal, Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the areas in the east that Russia illegally annexed but has not fully captured.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. is trying to find a compromise, but that “all sides must be ready for compromise.”\n\nNegotiators will return to the UAE on Feb. 1 for the next round of talks, according to a U.S. official. The recent talks covered a broad range of military and economic matters and included the possibility of a ceasefire before a deal, the official said. There was not yet an agreement on a final framework for oversight and operation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russia and is the largest in Europe.",

    "fullText": "Even though companies always want to avoid costly recalls, they are an unavoidable reality. There are now certain models of Toyota Tundra trucks that have become the subject of a nationwide safety recall that drivers should be aware of.\n\nOn January 23, 2026, the Toyota Newsroom website revealed that there was a voluntary safety recall for certain Tundra and Tundra Hybrid 2024 and 2025 models. The company stated that approximately 162,000 vehicles in the United States will be affected. Owners are set to be notified of the recall by late March 2026. The announcement included the following description of the issue that necessitated a fix.\n\n\"Under certain circumstances, the multimedia display may become stuck on a camera view or display a black image in the subject vehicles. If this occurs, the rearview image may not be displayed while the vehicle is being reversed. In this case, the vehicle may not meet a federal safety standard, and there can be an increased risk of a crash with a person behind the vehicle.\"\n\nFortunately for owners, the company described a simple fix that will be provided at no charge. \"For all involved vehicles, dealers will update the Parking Assist ECU software, free of charge.\"\n\nIn the automotive industry, there is very little that is as important as being reliable. On December 4, 2025, Consumer Reports published the findings of its 2026 Automotive Brand Report Card, which named Toyota as the most reliable brand overall. The consumer advocate company's website described the methodology they used to conclude that Toyota should get the highest rank.\n\n“The latest Consumer Reports Annual Auto Reliability Surveys gathered information from car owners on about 380,000 vehicles from model years 2000 to 2025 and early 2026. The survey covers up to 20 problem areas, including engine, electric motors, transmission, in-car electronics, and more. CR’s team of statisticians, researchers, and testers analyzed trouble areas and created an overall reliability score for each model and year. Serious problem areas that can lead to expensive repairs are more heavily weighted. Reliability predictions for 2026 models are based on each model’s overall reliability for the past three years, provided that the model hasn’t been redesigned during that time. If there is insufficient data on a model in any given model year, CR uses the brand reliability score to supplement that model’s new car prediction. The survey gathered information from car owners each year about problems they had with their vehicles in the past 12 months.”",

    "fullText": "The unshakeable influence of the Kardashians over the past decade has led to a rise in women trying to achieve the perfect, round derrière. But strong buttocks aren’t just an aesthetic goal – they have now also been recognised as an important indicator of our overall health.\n\n“The gluteus maximus is the powerhouse of all human movement,” says Dr Marjola Thanaj, a research fellow at the University of Westminster. “It’s a key trait that sets us apart from other primates.”\n\nA new study, led by Dr Thanaj, has revealed that the shape of the gluteus maximus muscles, found deep in our buttocks, can offer an early warning sign of the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nA team of researchers at the University of Westminster used more than 60,000 MRI scans, collected by the UK Biobank project, to study the shifts in the muscles caused by age, lifestyle and the onset of disease. These were combined with lifestyle and health data for each individual.\n\nThe results showed that the muscles of men and women changed in markedly different ways, as each gender edged closer to developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn men, there was a thinning of the gluteus maximus in specific regions – in some areas by as much as a quarter – giving it a more hollowed profile on scans. By contrast, the muscle appeared larger in women – deceptively, as this change was actually caused by fat infiltrating the muscle.\n\n“The findings suggest the gluteus maximus is a good indicator of metabolic health,” says Dr Thanaj.\n\nIt’s possible to spot clues in different bottom shapes that are likely to reflect the underlying health and function of the gluteus maximus muscle. Here are five common shapes and what they signify.\n\nWith fat evenly distributed in the upper and lower part of the buttocks, this shape is seen as highly desirable in women, reflected in the popularity of the “Brazilian bum lift”. In men, it is often associated with fitness and virility.\n\n“A round bottom could indicate good glute muscle mass and a good distribution of muscle and fat around the whole of the glutes,” says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in physiology at the University of Essex’s School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences. “Because the bottom is more filled out, this could mean there is more muscle, which means more strength and stability.”\n\n“People with round bottoms are likely to have good lower body strength,” agrees Kate Rowe-Ham, a personal trainer and the author of the health and fitness book for midlife women, Owning Your Menopause. “They might be doing activities such as lifting weights, sprinting and climbing.”\n\nFullest at the bottom and tapering in near the waistline, this shape – most commonly seen in women – is also associated with health.\n\n“Women often dislike being pear-shaped, which means they have a tendency to hold their fat around their bottom and thighs, but it’s far healthier than carrying fat in the middle of your body, around your organs,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nOverall size and tone matters, but if the buttocks are pert, rather than saggy, it’s a good sign. “This shape is a sign of better metabolic health compared to most of the others, showing strong mid-to-lower glutes and thighs,” says Dr Chung.\n\nThis shape has more mass in the upper portion of the bottom, with very little where it meets the thighs. It is common in post-menopausal women due to hormonal changes.\n\n“As women age and lose muscle, fat distribution can also shift from the bottom and thighs to the abdomen,” says Rowe-Ham. “They can find fat gathering around the hips and top of their bottom, creating ‘love handles’.”\n\nThis shape, which lacks volume, suggests weaker lower glutes and thighs, says Dr Chung.\n\nFlat across the hips and glutes, lacking fullness at either the top or lower part of the gluteus maximus, this shape can be seen in men or women – although it’s generally more pronounced in men due to their lack of hormone-driven fat around their hips and buttocks.\n\nIt often suggests a tendency to store fat around the middle or love handles, and can also imply reduced gluteal muscle volume or activity. “If that’s the case, it could result in lower overall lower-body strength, reduced hip and trunk stability and an increased load on the lower back and knees,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nBoth men and women tend to lose mass in their gluteus maximus, along with skin elasticity and firmness, as they age. Flatter, saggier bottoms that have a deflated look are common, regardless of people’s weight. “I often see this even in very slim people,” says Rowe-Ham. “They might look great in clothes, but if they’re not exercising to maintain muscle mass they’re not future-proofing their bodies.”\n\n“Flat bottoms tend to mean weaker glutes, which can lead to issues such as back, knee or hip pain,” says Dr Chung. Poor posture, reduced mobility and lower strength are also potential issues.\n\nAs the largest muscle in the body, the gluteus maximus drives forward propulsion, stabilises the pelvis and trunk and enables us to walk, run, climb and rise from a seated to a standing position with efficiency and control.\n\nIt also plays a major role in how well we process and use energy – if we’re not doing so efficiently, it can lead to conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and cardiovascular disease.\n\n“Large muscles, like the gluteus, act almost like ‘engines’ of the body,” explains Dr Thanaj. “The healthier and stronger these muscles are, the better the body can manage blood sugar, store and burn fuel and support healthy ageing.”\n\nAlthough the new study suggested that Type 2 diabetes triggers different responses in men and women to the structure of their gluteus maximus, in both cases, there was a reduction of healthy muscle tissue.\n\nDr Chung explains that maintaining muscle in our bottoms is particularly important, as it is the main site for glucose uptake in the body. “More muscle means more glucose being absorbed and stored, which then lowers blood sugar levels,” he says.\n\n“Increasing muscle also increases resting metabolic rate – the calories burnt at rest – whereas having more fat does the opposite and decreases metabolic efficiency.”\n\nHe adds that this area of the body is also “massively linked with bodily movement and longevity – more muscle means slower ageing and the ability to keep lifting things, walking upstairs, balancing and much more for longer”.\n\nSeveral factors affect the shape and size of our bottoms, including our overall weight, which is influenced by the calories we consume and the amount of exercise we do.\n\n“Genetics, pelvic width, hip bone shape and where a person stores fat also play a huge role,” says Dr Chung. Women are biologically predisposed to store more fat around the hips and buttocks to support fertility, pregnancy and lactation, while men tend to have a higher proportion of lean muscle in the gluteal region, due to testosterone, strength and propulsion.\n\nMost of the fat we can see in this area will be subcutaneous, which is far less harmful than visceral fat found around the organs, linked to a higher risk of conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke and certain cancers.\n\n“However, intramuscular fat, deeper fat that infiltrates the muscles, reduces muscle efficiency and has a negative impact on metabolic health,” says Dr Chung.\n\nAgeing, inactivity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity are linked to higher levels of this type of fat, but exercise – particularly resistance training – helps reduce it.\n\n“Targeting the glutes is essential as we age, as strong muscles act as an anchor for the whole body so we can continue to run, jump, react to falls, maintain good balance and more,” says Dr Chung.\n\n“Take more frequent breaks to get moving,” he says. Ideally, we should aim to stand up and move every 30-60 minutes.\n\n“Elevate your heels slightly with a rolled-up mat or towel, which will help you get deeper into the squat and really target the glutes,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nLie on your side, with your hand tucked under your head and knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Lift your top knee towards the ceiling like a clamshell opening, keeping hips stable and feet touching, and slowly lower back down. “It engages the glutes and also strengthens and stabilises the hips and core,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\n“Climb the stairs, or hills, or go hiking – find something that’s a bit more advanced than just walking,” says Dr Chung. This type of exercise will strengthen your leg muscles and give your entire cardiovascular system a workout as well as your glutes.\n\nTightening the buttocks for five seconds 10-15 times a day will activate and strengthen the muscles.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Chris Palmer, who went missing with his dog in the Outer Banks in North Carolina, is believed to be dead after his belongings were found along the coastline\n\nThe 39-year-old had gone to the Smoky Mountains to camp before he told his family signal was too spotty to stay in contact\n\nHis family has since shared that they “recently learned that Christopher was facing a terminal illness”\n\nA hiker, who went missing with his dog in the Outer Banks in North Carolina, is believed to be dead after his belongings were found.\n\nTwo weeks after Chris Palmer, 39, went missing in North Carolina, his father, Bren Palmer, shared on social media that he and his family made the “difficult decision” to put a stop to all active search efforts for his son.\n\n“We recently learned that Christopher was facing a terminal illness,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 24. “Knowing this has helped us understand the choices he made. Christopher loved the outdoors and valued his independence. The treatments ahead would have taken much of that away, and he did not want that future for himself.”\n\nNoting that Chris’s belongings were discovered near the coastline, Bren said that their family believes he “perished in the sea.”\n\n“As heartbreaking as this is, we have found a measure of peace in that understanding,” he continued. “We are deeply proud of the man Christopher was, and we hope his story brings awareness to the emotional and mental burdens people can face during serious medical challenges.”\n\n“We would like to thank the United Cajun Navy and every volunteer, first responder, and community member who searched for our son,” he added. “It has been profoundly humbling to see so many people care for someone they never met. Our family is at peace and asks that Christopher’s memory and the safety of others be respected as we seek closure.”\n\nThe update comes eight days after Chris was officially declared missing with his dog after a truck belonging to him was found on a North Carolina beach on Jan. 12, three days after he last made contact with his family, according to the National Park Service.\n\nIn a Jan. 20 news release, officials said, “Palmer is believed to be traveling with his German shepherd and may still be in the area.”\n\nTwo days later, the NPS shared in an update that, after reviewing Dare County traffic camera footage, investigators believe Palmer’s truck was in Dare County as early as the afternoon of Jan. 9. While it was not there when the vehicle was found on the beach, footage showed that there was a blue and white kayak in the back of the vehicle at the time.\n\nBren shared on Jan. 19 that his son went to the Smoky Mountains with his dog Zoey to camp 11 days prior.\n\n“He does alot of camping in the national forests,” he explained on Facebook. “He lets us know when and where he is going and when he is expected to return.”\n\nWhile he had received frequent communications from Chris up until Jan. 9, Bren noted that his son had told him that signal became too spotty to talk the day before his truck was found abandoned on the beach “hours away in the opposite direction he was headed.”\n\n“The National Park Service are currently searching for him with teams and infrared drones near  buxton,” he wrote at the time. “Im [sic] asking for prayers that he is found safe and send this to friends you might know in the mention areas.”",

    "description": "Tom Cruise has reportedly left the staff at his $47 million London apartment \"stunned\" by his abrupt departure from the UK.",
    "fullText": "Tom Cruise has reportedly left the staff at his $47 million London apartment \"stunned\" by his abrupt departure from the UK.\n\nA source revealed that the actor, who once declared himself an \"Anglophile,\" made the decision to leave for the US \"very quickly,\" describing the move as \"strange.\"\n\nThis comes a few weeks after it was revealed that Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology had \"angered\" locals of East Grinstead with their disruptions while attending fundraisers in England.\n\nCruise has made an abrupt decision to move back to the US after spending years in the UK, where he was sometimes seen enjoying pub outings and even hanging out with the future king, Prince William.\n\nAccording to a source who spoke with the Mail on Sunday, staff were left \"stunned\" by his sudden departure, with some spotted removing boxes of possessions at the \"Mission Impossible\" star's £35 million [$47 million] London penthouse property, which overlooks Hyde Park.\n\nWhile the reason for his move is currently unclear, a source noted that it happened \"very quickly\" and seemingly out of the blue.\n\nSpeaking with the news outlet, the source said, \"Tom loved London. He loved where he lived; he would get up and go for [a] run around Hyde Park in the mornings. He loved walking in the local area, but he also really, really enjoyed jumping in a helicopter at Battersea Heliport and flying off into the quintessentially British countryside.\"\n\nThe source continued, \"It all happened very quickly; it was a surprise to the staff at the building where his penthouse is. It's most strange. The UK became both his professional headquarters and private playground, with discrete dates, tightly-guarded movements, and late-night arrivals.\"\n\n\"England became far more than just a filming base,\" they added about Cruise's sudden exit.\n\nBefore Cruise's decision to seemingly return to the US, he had become very well known for his love of the UK, where he had been making films for over 40 years.\n\nLast year, the actor was recognized for his contribution to the UK film industry and was awarded a BFI fellowship by the British Film Institute.\n\nAt the event held in May, Cruise noted, \"I'm truly honoured, I've been making films in the UK for over 40 years and have no plans to stop.\"\n\nBack in 2022, the actor also labeled himself an \"Anglophile\" because he spent a lot of \"time in Britain, and that's not just for work reasons.\"\n\n\"I just love being here,\" he stated at the time, per the Daily Mail. \"It's a fantastic blend of old and new... Britain is trendy, too, and has a lot that other countries then copy. I also love the British countryside.\"\n\nCruise was also said to have been interested in buying some properties in the Cotswolds, as he hoped to strengthen his ties to the UK, making his sudden departure, which reportedly included him removing his blackout curtains from his penthouse, even more puzzling.\n\nCruise, who has somewhat become the face of the Church of Scientology because of his vocal support over the years, recently came under fire after locals made complaints about him and his organization.\n\nThe actor makes it a point of duty to attend the Church's annual fundraiser in England. However, last year's edition in December allegedly \"angered\" residents of East Grinstead because of the disruption it brought to their everyday lives.\n\nThe small town located in West Sussex is home to the British headquarters of the Church and often receives guests in large numbers when such events are happening.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, former Scientologist Alexander Barnes-Ross said that the locals are \"extremely frustrated and angered\" by the instant increase in population during the fundraiser, and were particularly uncomfortable with the disturbance caused by Cruise \"flying in on his helicopter.\"\n\n\"It causes a lot of noise and nuisance, and he [Tom Cruise], you know, doesn't stop for photos or anything,\" Barnes-Ross shared.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, a resident described the Church's order of proceedings right from the preparation stages as \"very disruptive.\"\n\n\"For six to eight weeks, they were laying down pallets in the field to make a car park, so we had the disruption and noise of that, with lorry after lorry coming,\" the unidentified local said of Cruise's Church.\n\nDuring the event proper, more of such chaos would follow as the Church uses generators to power heavy equipment and also plays loud musical instruments.\n\nReports suggest the community feels \"helpless\" as to what they'll do, as some town leaders also attend the Church and have a good relationship with the organization.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, locals have since filed a complaint with the Mid Sussex District Council, noting that the event attended by Cruise and other high-profile church members causes \"considerable disruptions\" to the area.\n\nIt allegedly brings about traffic congestion and noise pollution. The complaint would see the Church's premises license undergo a review.\n\nIf the local community wins, the Church could be asked to tone down the large scale of events it organizes or implement measures to protect vulnerable people.",

    "description": "‘Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm,’ the former Georgia congresswoman wrote",
    "fullText": "Marjorie Taylor Greene has urged fellow MAGA supporters – and other Americans – to “take off their political blinders” over the death of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, warning that they are being “incited into civil war.”\n\n“I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement,” Greene wrote on X Sunday, the day after the fatal shooting. “However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment.\n\n“Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.”\n\nDespite video showing that 37-year-old Pretti was filming federal officers but did not have a weapon drawn, the Trump administration has claimed he had tried to assassinate agents in an act of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nThe incident was captured from multiple angles, including one that showed Pretti being sprayed with mace and wrestled to the ground while attempting to help a woman who had just been sprayed herself and had fallen to the ground. After being swarmed by around seven officers a shot rings out, followed by at least nine more, and Pretti falls still.\n\n“There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing,” Greene said.\n\nThe former Congresswoman asked MAGA to consider another scenario in which she replaced the protesters in Minnesota with those who supported the action on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\n“We lost our minds when we watched Biden’s FBI track down and aggressively carry out home invasions and arrest… peaceful J6’ers who walked in the Capitol through open doors,” she said.\n\n“Imaging [sic] if one of our MAGA independent journalists or even just a MAGA supporter stood in the street outside a J6’ers house while Biden’s FBI carried out a law enforcement operation, home invasion, and arrest.\n\n“Then Biden’s FBI goes to the MAGA guy videoing it all and shoves a woman with him to the ground and sprays them with bear spray then throws the MAGA guy to the ground as MAGA guy was trying to help the woman off the ground. Then Biden’s FBI beats MAGA guy on the ground, disarms MAGA guy, and then shoots him dead.\n\n“What would have been our reaction? Both sides need to take off their political blinders. You are all being incited into civil war, yet none of it solves any of the real problems that we all face, and tragically people are dying.”\n\nPretti’s death is the second fatal shooting to involve federal agents in Minneapolis in less than three weeks, following the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on January 7. Tensions and clashes between demonstrators have increased, as well as those between state and federal authorities.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said earlier Sunday that residents, as well as his own police department have “had enough.”\n\n“This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This has taken an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of trying to be the police department for a major city,” O’Hara told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nO’Hara noted that he has received no official information from the federal government related to Saturday’s shooting. “Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting,” he said.\n\nWhile the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was blocked from the scene of the shooting Saturday by federal officials, they were allowed access Sunday to canvas for witnesses.\n\nGreene’s comments represent the latest instance of her breaking from MAGA orthodoxy. Previously a firebrand Trump loyalist, she has publicly broken from the president in recent months over issues including the Epstein files and foreign policy. She stood down from Congress earlier this month.",
