Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos 10-7 to claim the AFC Championship amid freezing temperatures.\n\nWide receiver Stefon Diggs advanced to his first Super Bowl following the gritty victory, prompting an emotional celebration from his girlfriend, Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B, in the owner's suite. The haymaker came on kicker Andy Borregales’ 23-yard field goal in the third quarter, a 23-yard dart through the falling snow that provided the ultimate margin of victory. While the snowfall in Denver created a difficult environment for the players and the fans in attendance, the Patriots secured their 12th Super Bowl appearance in franchise history.\n\nOverall, the Patriots offense relied on a punishing 16-play drive – consuming nine minutes and 53 seconds of the clock – effectively grounding a Broncos attack that struggled to find rhythm in the adverse conditions. Diggs recorded five receptions for 17 yards during the low-scoring affair. Quarterback Drake Maye served as the statistical engine of the team during the game in Denver. Maye finished with 65 rushing yards and scored the only touchdown for the Patriots, navigating the snow with precision.\n\nStefon Diggs mutually parted ways with the Houston Texans after a one-year stint in 2025. However, it appears that his decision to sign a three-year contract with New England in March has paid dividends. The victory represents the first Super Bowl trip for Diggs in his career, vindication after he previously lost conference championship games while playing for the Minnesota Vikings and the Buffalo Bills.\n\nMORE: 3 reasons Patriots defense dominated in AFC playoffs — and can keep it up in Super Bowl 60\n\nCardi B was one of the thousands of Patriots fans who were tuned in for what became Diggs' first conference championship victory after multiple attempts. Apart from being a featured presence on the official Patriots Instagram account, the Grammy-winner’s appearance in the owner's suite marked another high-profile show of support now that the team has officially advanced. Over the past several months, the rapper has stood by Diggs' side as the veteran receiver navigated through a difficult recovery period following an ACL injury.\n\nShe shared her feelings with NFL Network reporter Cameron Wolfe after the win. The rapper described the pride she felt watching the receiver return from his injury, saying:\n\n\"I'm feeling very excited, I'm very happy for him, very proud of him,” Cardi B said. “He just came back from an ACL, and me seeing the progress and the process of him going through there, from the first time he started running back.\"\n\nCardi B life as a football girlie going well @iamcardib\n\nOur 1-on-1 chat as Stefon Diggs “hard work and discipline” journey leads him to Super Bowl. pic.twitter.com/vJnpEFl2rA\n\n— Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) January 26, 2026\n\nCardi B attributed the success of Diggs to his personal discipline and work ethic. There is no more disciplined athlete, maybe in the current locker room of the Patriots, than Stefon Diggs. She said:\n\n\"Discipline. Discipline and work. It's not like, oh, you wake up and you great. It's... it's discipline. It's going to bed early. It's go... waking up early. It's... it's not missing one day of work, nothing. It's discipline. Simple... hard discipline.\"\n\nThe rapper confirmed her relationship with Diggs in June and gave birth to their son in November, since becoming a regular at games. Wolfe mentioned that Diggs helped Cardi B transition into being a fan of the sport, referring to the rapper as a member of the \"brigade\" of Patriots supporters. She wore a Patriots cap and had green hair while attending the game in Denver. She said:\n\n\"Not at all. I mean, I'm a... I'm a big baseball fan. I'm a Red Sox fan. Everybody knows I'm a Red Sox fan. So... it's kind of cool that we keeping it... in New England.\"\n\nNew England will face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60 on Jan. 25. The Seahawks advanced after winning the NFC Championship game on the same day. Diggs was emotional after the victory and noted the team had more work to finish.\n\nMore New England Patriots News:\n\nSuper Bowl 2026 odds: Seahawks vs. Patriots best bets on opening lines\n\nMalcolm Butler's Super Bowl INT flashbacks begin ahead of Patriots-Seahawks rematch\n\nTeams, odds, spread and more for 2026 Super Bowl matchup",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor a few years, there existed a conspiracy theory that the colors of the Super Bowl logo predicted which two teams would play for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nWell, that one is out, and a new theory is in.\n\nSome NFL fans believe a preseason graphic the league posted to its social media accounts actually predicted the seemingly unpredictable Super Bowl 60 matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, two teams that hadn't won a playoff game since 2019 before this season.\n\nHere's a look at the graphic behind the NFL's newest \"script writer\" conspiracy theory.\n\nMORE:Super Bowl 60 odds, spread as Seahawks open as favorites\n\nAfter the Patriots and Seahawks punched their ticket to the Super Bowl, fans started to notice which two quarterbacks seem to be closer to the giant Lombardi Trophy than the rest in this graphic posted by the NFL on the first day of the regular season:\n\n— RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) January 26, 2026\n\nA closer inspection reveals you can make the case Baker Mayfield was actually closer than Darnold, or that Travis Hunter seems to be the closest to the trophy.\n\nThis is no time for facts, though. NFL fans have unearthed the latest grand Super Bowl conspiracy, and it's true that Maye and Darnold were both front and center in relation to the Lombardi Trophy in the graphic just as they are in reality today.\n\n\"They really gave us the script in September,\" the lead Drake Maye fan account tweeted Sunday night.\n\nThey really gave us the script in September https://t.co/ofeVgBdbPb\n\n— Drake Maye Lover (@drakemayeloverr) January 26, 2026\n\nAnother look at the graphic reveals the NFL probably believed a Patriots-Seahawks Super Bowl was enormously unlikely. The sport's biggest names are front-and-center, from Saquon Barkley and Patrick Mahomes to Brock Purdy and Joe Burrow. Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen are also closer to Mahomes and Barkley than they are to Maye and Darnold in the distance.\n\nConsidering players from the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Tennessee Titans are standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder with Maye and Darnold in the distance, it seems more like the league discounted the Patriots and Seahawks than predicted their Super Bowl 60 meeting.\n\nWhy let the finer details get in the way of a good conspiracy theory, though?\n\nSeahawks take down Rams to advance to Super Bowl 60\n\nSam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba star for Seahawks in NFC championship\n\nRams' special teams blunders continue in NFC championship\n\nSeahawks Pope trend continues with Super Bowl 60 berth",

    "fullText": "The boos lurch up from the Lower Gladys end. Guttural, albeit technically premature, 45 seconds-ish too quick for the final whistle.\n\nNot that you can blame the Everton faithful for wanting to call it quits on this drab 1-0 Women’s Super League defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, Everton’s ninth loss of the season and their sixth at home. Sometimes that familiar chemical instinct just takes over, the brain telling the body to commit and just make it stop.\n\nThere’s something to be said for keeping heritage alive, that even the ‘Goodison Boo’ won’t be condemned to sepia-tint without a fight. We can still get angry here, fellas. There’s another thing to be said altogether about those boos returning so soon after the early-season promise of new hope and new chapters.\n\nAs of Sunday night, following victories for Liverpool and West Ham over Tottenham Hotspur and Leicester City, Brian Sorensen’s side sit third-from-bottom in the WSL, one point above bottom Liverpool, level on points with West Ham United and a point off Leicester above them.\n\nMaybe The Athletic is overreacting. But it feels many have forgotten there is a threat of relegation this season, that, with the WSL’s expansion from 12 to 14 teams and the promotion play-off between the bottom-placed WSL side and third-placed WSL2 side. For whatever reason, the spectre of the latter has been met in press boxes and boardrooms with a shrug, another shrug, some WSL-WSL2 equivalent of, “Lads, it’s Tottenham”.\n\nYet, it was clear on Friday night from those in the Goodison stands that they weren’t underplaying the risk, nor those Liverpool fans at St Helens on Sunday, twirling their red-and-white striped scarves over their heads at having finally tasted the sweet lacquer of league victory this season following their 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nAnd it was these scenes, so disparate in their respective anguish and relief, that should serve as a reminder to those running these clubs that the threat of relegation is very real.\n\nThe gap between the top of WSL2 and the bottom of WSL has, in recent history, been more precarious than conquerable, the financial buy-in required to compete not worth the pay-off for most ownerships. Yet, this January, WSL2 teams at the top are bolstering their ranks, fuelled by the knowledge that if there is a time to get in on this women’s football deal, now is it. Two WSL2 win an automatic pass to the top. The third wins a one-off showdown on home turf with the bottom-placed WSL side.\n\nThe latter is a prospect that has emboldened rather than deterred. Former top-flight sides Bristol City and Crystal Palace, seven and eight points behind leaders Charlton Athletic, have both been busy securing players with WSL experience.\n\nBirmingham City, five points behind Charlton, spent a reported second-tier record £270,000 ($370,000) to sign midfielder Wilma Leidhammar from Norrkoping.\n\nThree and a half years ago, such a fee would have been a world record.\n\nNow, it’s a benchmark for second-tier ambition.\n\nIt is also a timely warning to WSL teams who forget that the top-flight is a privilege, not a right.\n\nLiverpool have, for their part, heeded this, spending more than £1million in the January transfer window on an encouraging array of future promise and present impact. Three of those players – goalkeeper Jennifer Falk, midfielder Denise O’Sullivan (brought in for a club-record fee of £300,000 from North Carolina Courage) and Aurelie Csillag – were instrumental in Sunday’s victory.\n\nA big January had always been the plan, taking a half-season to adjust to a new playing style under new management, to give new recruitment head Rob Clarkson, who joined in the summer, time to gauge where the additional stitching was required before committing to any wholesale changes.\n\nYet, before kick-off on Sunday at St Helen’s, there still skulked a jittery energy in the press room and in the terraces, an understanding that the prevailing winds needed changing and fast. While the gap in quality between the WSL and WSL2 is still notable, momentum and morale can play a part.\n\nThe same realisation slowly permeated around Goodison at full time on Friday night. The Everton hierarchy’s vision for this season did not include injuries to key players such as captain Megan Finnigan and forward Katja Snoeijs, the departure of CEO Hannah Forshaw after less than a year in the role, or the ongoing transfer row with France striker Kelly Gago, whom Everton made their highest-paid player in the summer.\n\nBut there is a recognition internally that performances under Sorensen, often laborious with players unable to execute tactical nuances, have not been good enough. There is also recognition that Everton remain a work in progress and that the persistent calls to the new ownership for more investment in the squad – whose budget is the second-lowest in the WSL for the third successive season, according to sources – can’t keep being ignored.\n\nAnd perhaps that is what is needed: the sharpening of vision, the cold-blooded rush of survival mode.\n\nBefore the season began, there was an acknowledgement among senior figures at numerous WSL clubs that the watermark for existence had risen, that getting by would require more pocket-digging. Six months later, there is a growing understanding that those earlier projections were actually lowballed, that valuations and fees are rising more quickly than had been imagined.\n\nEven without the threat of relegation, Everton fans’ discontent is understandable. According to Opta, only at Arsenal’s Meadow Park (no wins) and Manchester City’s Joie Stadium (no wins) do Everton have a worse win rate than at Goodison Park (10 per cent).\n\nIf a WSL team finds itself on the sorry end of the promotion play-off, it will boil down to a failure to take the tide seriously, to sitting slack-jawed in the directors box as the walls cave in and those clubs around you nab yet another player off your wishlist.\n\nBecause that is where the stench of relegation begins to waft, eventually latching onto a depleted bench and another lacklustre backwards pass.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nLiverpool, Everton, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "There are a slew of San Francisco 49ers free agents eligible for a franchise tag, but only one player makes sense to use it on.",
    "fullText": "It's rare that the San Francisco 49ers use their franchise tag during an offseason. We may see that rare occurrence in 2026.\n\nThere are 21 players eligible for franchise tags among the 49ers' 2026 free agents. Among those 21, only kicker Eddy Pineiro stands out as a real candidate for the tag.\n\nGeneral manager John Lynch and head coach Kyle Shanahan have typically been conservative about using the team's franchise tag on pending free agents, opting instead to either sign them to long-term deals or trade them for draft capital.\n\nThe only time they've used a franchise tag since taking over as the GM and head coach in 2017 was in 2019 when kicker Robbie Gould was set to hit free agency. Gould held out for a long-term deal and ultimately agreed to a four-year, $19 million deal with $10.5 million guaranteed instead of playing on the one-year, $5 million tag.\n\nWe may see something similar this offseason, although it's unclear whether Pineiro would hold out the same way Gould did.\n\nAfter joining the 49ers in Week 2, Pineiro went 28-for-29 on field goal tries in the regular season with his only miss coming on a 64-yard try that hit the crossbar. He was also a perfect three-for-three in the postseason. Given the 49ers' kicking woes it would make sense that they'll aim to keep Pineiro in the building.\n\nThe only other player who might receive a franchise tag is wide receiver Jauan Jennings, but Over the Cap projects the tag for a wide receiver to clear $28 million for one year. San Francisco may desire a reunion with Jennings. They're likely ready to pass at that exorbitant price tag.\n\nThat opens the door for the 49ers to use their tag on Pineiro to ensure some stability at the kicker position for at least one year with the chance of making him their kicker for the foreseeable future.\n\nMore 49ers: Grading the 49ers' 2025 rookie class after elimination\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 49ers free agents: K Eddy Pineiro a franchise tag candidate",

    "fullText": "Purdue played an overall great game against the Illini but it was to no avail as Keaton Wagler had one of the greatest performances in Mackey Arena history on the way to an 88-82 victory for Illinois. It was an unfortunate loss for a team that has struggled to maintain leads in the last several games that have led to lots of questions from fans and pundits alike about Purdue’s ability to win the B1G and make a run in March. Can the Boilers get back on track? They’ll have a big opportunity to do so Tuesday night against Indiana inside Assembly Hall.\n\nLet’s take a look at the loss to the Illini ‘By the Numbers.’\n\nIt was an historic day for Illinois’ star freshman. Keaton Wagler entered the game against Purdue as the Illini’s leading scorer at 15.3ppg and tabbed as a possible lottery draft pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. Wagler elevated himself into rarified air with an amazing 46 point performance that showed the 6’6 guard may just be moving towards B1G player of the year and first team All-American.\n\nKeaton Wagler scored the most points EVER by a visitor at Mackey 😱:\n\n46 PTS\n13-17 FG\n9-11 3PT\n\nWOW. pic.twitter.com/KVAd0B0W0A\n\n— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) January 24, 2026\n\nMackey Arena is typically a place where the best players can often struggle to get going. Steph Curry visited and found it difficult to do much of anything with Chris Kramer and the Paint Crew hounding him all game long. What kind of history did Wagler make? He now owns the highest single game scoring record for any opponent inside Mackey Arena and the third highest in any venue in Purdue’s entire program history.\n\nSimply put: This is what other teams felt like when Carsen Edwards would show up and hit everything once he crossed halfcourt.\n\nWagler’s performance was an all-time great one but Braden Smith had himself a day as well. The senior guard started off a little slow but when the Boilers needed someone to match Wagler’s scoring, he showed why he is likely to be a first team All American and win the Bob Cousy Award again. Smith would go for 27 points and 12 assists on just 1 turnover while playing 37 minutes and those three minutes were largely because he sprained his ankle in the second half.\n\nBraden Smith today:\n27 points\n3 rebounds\n12 assists\n1 steal\n69% FG\n2/3 3PM\n\n#4 Purdue lost to #11 Illinois by 6 pic.twitter.com/LhOii0TwI3\n\n— Daily Basketball Statlines (@DailyNBAStats) January 25, 2026\n\nSmith has continued to be stellar but simply isn’t getting the help he needs from teammates, specifically his fellow seniors in TKR and Loyer. Purdue still has the ability to attain their goals but it won’t happen with those two not playing up to what they should be as seniors.\n\nOmer Mayer came to Purdue as a player who was known to have a bit of scorers touch to his game that may be above his age. He flashed that for Israel at FIBA and seemingly in the preseason but the season started off rather rough from behind the arc. That hasn’t deterred Mayer up to this point as he has played really good defense and seemingly continued to contribute in almost any other way.\n\nIn the first 12 games, Mayer struggled from nearly everywhere on the floor. The freshman shot just 30/77 (39%) from the floor and 11/41 (26.8%) from behind the arc. He isn’t expected to be a primary scorer but being someone who can clearly generate his own shot and showing an ability to catch and shoot lifts Purdue’s offense. In the last eight games though, Mayer has turned it around.\n\nLost in that half: Omer Mayer being the best overseas pro in a game full of them. Those two threes were really important for #Purdue.\n\n— Brian Neubert — GoldandBlack.com (@brianneubert) January 24, 2026\n\nMayer has seemingly found his form, shooting 10/19 from behind the arc for 52.6% while averaging 1.1 turnovers. That’s a big key for a player who will definitely shoulder a bigger scoring load next season. That need was seen somewhat after Smith went to the bench with an ankle sprain and Mayer responded with 5 points, 1 rebound, and 1 assist in short span where he was needed more. He is actually scoring less but is much more efficient.\n\nIt isn’t often that Purdue over the last 40 years is utterly dominated on the glass like it was against the Illini. A 14 rebound advantage of 33-19 is one thing but giving up 13 offensive rebounds that led to an 18-2 advantage in second chance points was devastating. Purdue had less turnovers, converted those into points (more on that later), and shot 57% from the field. Allowing the Illini to break their spirit on the glass was the one things that it couldn’t afford to let happen with Wagler’s performance.\n\nThat minus fourteen rebounding mark is the worst performance for Purdue since they did the same against Illinois on January 21st, 2020.\n\nPurdue once again showed their ability in handling the ball in a high level manner by only turning the ball over for a program tying record (for a second time this season) of just three times. On the flipside, the Illini turned it over just ten times but Purdue converted those into 20 points. Purdue was +17 in that regard and it helped offset the rebounding and second chance scoring advantage the Illini had.\n\nNobody is going to question the impact that Fletcher Loyer can have on a basketball game. He is rarely in the wrong position on defense and always seems to be in the right place on offense. The issue over the last several games is that where he brings the most value on the offensive end as a dead-eye shooter and offensive mis-match just isn’t happening.\n\nPurdue needs more out of Fletcher Loyer. \n\nAveraging just 6.0 PPG in his last three games while shooting a combined 5-20 from the field and 2-12 from three-point range during that span. \n\nThe Boilers can't go back to the Final Four with Loyer playing like this.\n\n— Jon Rothstein (@JonRothstein) January 25, 2026\n\nOver the last nine games, Loyer is shooting just 14/54 for 25.9% from behind the arc. In fact, this is probably the most difficult stretch of shooting Loyer has endured in his career at Purdue. The frustrating thing is that Loyer is playing at a high level everywhere else for the Boilers but his ability to make threes is what gives him the most value. He isn’t good enough to be a scorer inside the arc alone and he isn’t good enough defensively to warrant that being his primary role either.\n\nFor Purdue to reach the goals it has for itself this season, it needs Loyer to figure out the shooting woes. In the struggles he has had in previous seasons, it was followed up with a long stretch of elite shooting, There is no reason that can’t happen again and it needs to happen if Purdue wants to win the B1G title.\n\nAgainst the Illini, Purdue was very secure with the ball. In fact, it was the 5th consecutive game that Purdue kept their turnovers in single digits. That is the type of ball security CMP has known this team is capable of having with the level of ball handlers it has in Smith, Loyer, Cox, Mayer, Harris, and Benter. In fact, this isn’t even the longest stretch of this level of security Purdue has had recently.\n\nLast season from the game against UCLA all the way to the first round matchup against High Point, Purdue went six straight games of turnovers in single digits. The Boilers did have a five game stretch in the 2018-2019 and 2011-2012 but their ability to limit turnovers appears to be the best of the CMP era this season.\n\nSince the start of the Keady-era, Purdue has rarely ever gotten through a season where it hasn’t suffered back to back losses. That has occurred in just 6 total seasons in that forty six year span and shows how difficult the grind of a B1G schedule truly can be. Those seasons were 2023-2024, 2016-2017, 1993-1994, 1989-1990, 1987-1988, and 1986-1987.\n\nOn the flipside of that, there have been some rough seasons that Purdue fans have had to endure as well. In the 2005-2006 season, the Boilers were just a bad basketball team that finished 9-19 and lost fifteen of their last eighteen games. Now, what about the worst losing streak for a Boiler squad that made the NCAA tourney? That would go to the 1990-1991 team that lost five straight games and made the tourney as a 7-seed but got beat in the first round by 10th seeded Temple.\n\nLosses happen in long seasons and losing back to back games is more common than you may realize. Even really good teams in Purdue history have lost back to back games but that isn’t necessarily cause for worry. The key will be how the Boilers continue to use what they learn through the season to find ways to improve and that’s something this group and this coaching staff have shown a high ability to do.\n\nWith his nine points scored, Oscar Cluff surpassed the 1,000 point mark with 1,007 points for his career that has spanned three seasons at Washington State, South Dakota State, and now Purdue. Cluff isn’t likely to break his single season scoring record of 528 and he isn’t likely to break any other personal records, but he has been exactly what the Boilers needed (not withstanding the apparent scheme issue that came to a head against UCLA and Illinois).\n\n1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣\n\n4th active Boilermaker to reach that mark. pic.twitter.com/XhX7wTASIT\n\n— Purdue Men's Basketball (@BoilerBall) January 24, 2026\n\nWith his twelve assists, Braden Smith now has 943 career assists. That places him twelfth overall just behind Doug Gottleib’s 947. Smith is now just 133 assists behind Bobby Hurley’s record with 11 games left. To break the record, here is where he needs to be:\n\n11 games (no post season games): 12.1 assists per game\n13 games (2 post season games): 10.23 assists per game\n14 games (3 post season games): 9.5 assists per game\n15 games (4 post season games): 8.9 assists per game\n18 games (7 post season games): 7.4 assists per game\n20 games (9 post season games-BTT Final & National Championship): 6.65 assists per game\n\nBraden Smith with a RIDICULOUS pass 🪄\n\n(via @FOXSports)pic.twitter.com/j5KbVLaLFu\n\n— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) January 24, 2026",

    "description": "Matthew Stafford was brilliant. Sean McVay was a maestro. And yet, the Los Angeles Rams' season of labor evaporated in a cascade of margins in Seattle.",
    "fullText": "SEATTLE — What happens to a dream deferred?\n\nDoes it dry up like a raisin in the incessant, mocking Seattle cold?\n\nDoes it fester like a wound, salted by the sting of a single yard, a single catch, a single decision in the cruel calculus of a championship game?\n\nOr does it simply sag, a heavy weight on the shoulders of 53 men in blue and gold, as the opposing confetti falls like an alien, hateful snow?\n\nFor the Los Angeles Rams, the dream of a return to the summit, of completing a masterful two-year reconstruction, was deferred, denied, and finally extinguished in a 31-27 NFC Championship loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIt was a defeat scripted not by a lack of talent or heart, but by the finest of margins—the slivers of error that separate confetti from emptiness.\n\nMatthew Stafford was majestic; he was MVP-esque.\n\nHe carved the NFL's top-ranked scoring defense with the precision of a neurosurgeon, completing 22 of 35 passes for 374 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe threw darts into pinholes, launching seven completions for 226 yards on passes that traveled 20+ air yards—the most surrendered by Seattle in a decade.\n\n\"He's the MVP of the league,\" head coach Sean McVay said. \"This guy played at a level that's just different.\"\n\nMcVay himself called a luminous game, his play-action designs rendering Seattle's fierce pass rush a step slow, generating 208 yards from deception alone.\n\nFor long stretches, the Rams' offense was a symphony of synchronized beauty. Puka Nacua, who had nine receptions for 165 yards and a touchdown, was a force of nature.\n\nDavante Adams turned back the clock with four receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown.\n\nYet, the symphony ended flat, missing its final, crucial notes.\n\nFootball games, particularly championship games, are won in the margins.\n\nYou win by capitalizing on every opportunity to extend a lead, especially before halftime, not surrendering it.\n\nLeading 13-10 with 1:33 left in the second quarter, the Rams' offense went three-and-out, a puny, passive series that gifted Seattle 54 seconds.\n\nSam Darnold—the maligned, the itinerant, the USC quarterback whose marred legacy, built by ghastly, past collapses—marched the Seahawks 79 yards in six plays.\n\nA touchdown. A 17-13 deficit. A tide turned.\n\n\"We had our chances,\" McVay said. \"I thought we got a lot of what we wanted today.\"\n\nXavier Smith, reliable all year, let the slick ball slip through his grasp in the third quarter. One play later, Darnold found Jake Bobo for a 17-yard score.\n\nA potential stop became an 11-point hole.\n\n\"That was a tough one,\" McVay said. \"You feel like you're going to get some good momentum… and then they score on the very first play.\"\n\nThe margins are a fourth-down calculus.\n\nTrailing 31-27 with 4:52 left, the Rams faced 4th and 4 at the Seattle 6-yard line.\n\nA field goal makes it a one-point game; however, analytics screamed to go for it.\n\nMcVay, the modern evangelist of aggression, listened.\n\nDevon Witherspoon deflected Stafford's pass for Terrence Ferguson, and the Rams walked away with nothing.\n\nAnd so, the dream of an opportunity to hoist the Lombardi Trophy for the third time in nine years––is deferred.\n\nNow, the questions hang in the Los Angeles air, thick and urgent.\n\nWhere do the Rams go from here?\n\nHow do they bolster a secondary that proved porous over the season's latter half, a unit torched for 153 yards by Jaxon Smith-Njigba alone?\n\nHow do they reinforce a linebacking corps that, at times, was outmatched in coverage and containment?\n\nThe labor to craft this contender was Herculean. There is no assurance of a return.\n\nThe NFC landscape offers no solace.\n\nSeattle, with Mike Macdonald's defensive genius, has the makings of a sustained beast.\n\nChicago's offense buds with terrifying potential.\n\nPhiladelphia simmers, a quarterback adjustment away.\n\nSan Francisco, if it can ever stanch its injury plague, remains a monster.\n\nAnd on the other side stood Sam Darnold.\n\nEveryone must now rewrite the narrative of his career—that he folds and crumples under pressure.\n\nDarnold completed 25 of 36 for 346 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe stood resolute, becoming the first USC quarterback to start a Super Bowl.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" Darnold said. \"To be able to do it with these guys… that's why it means the world to me.\"\n\nIn the Rams' silent locker room, the dream lay not exploded, but deflated.\n\nStafford's brilliance, McVay's mastery—both rendered artifacts of a path not taken.\n\nLangston Hughes' poem asks what happens to a dream deferred.\n\nOn this night, the Rams live the answer: it doesn't explode. It just slowly, painfully, drains away, leaving only the hard questions of an endless offseason and the haunting vision of what might have been, one yard, one catch, one decision away.",

    "description": "\"It was one of the most bizarre, sad games I’ve ever been a part of.\"",
    "fullText": "The mood inside the Target Center was, understandably, off on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhile the Golden State Warriors did roll to a near-30-point blowout over the Minnesota Timberwolves, it wasn’t the game that threw the vibes off. It was everything else going on just outside of the arena doors on the streets of Minneapolis that did it.\n\nThat, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said after the Warriors' 111-85 win, was very apparent.\n\n“Honestly what I felt was that their group was suffering,” Kerr said, via ESPN’s Anthony Slater. “I thought the vibe in the stands, it was one of the most bizarre, sad games I’ve ever been a part of. You could feel the somber atmosphere. Their team, we could tell, they were struggling with everything that’s been going on and what the city has been through.\n\n“It was very sad. It was a sad night.”\n\nSteve Kerr called the arena atmosphere in Minneapolis today one of the most “bizarre, sad” vibes he’s experienced at a game\n\nWarriors blew out the Timberwolves. \n\n“Honestly what I felt was that their group was suffering.” pic.twitter.com/K1EsR6Fr8j\n\n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) January 26, 2026\n\nSunday’s game was initially supposed to be held on Saturday, but the league quickly pushed it 24 hours in the wake of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Veterans Affairs nurse Alex Pretti by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. That came just weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good elsewhere in the city. Those shootings, as well as larger ICE operations and activity throughout the Twin Cities region, have sparked massive protests and demonstrations.\n\nPlenty in the sports world have spoken out, including several Minnesota sports teams and the National Basketball Players Association. New York Liberty star and Unrivaled co-founder Breanna Stewart held an “Abolish ICE” sign before her game on Sunday. Former Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns and Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton both posted about it on social media.\n\nAfter seeing the situation unfold, both Kerr and Timberwolves coach Chris Finch were in agreement. Playing basketball on Saturday, Finch said, “just didn’t feel like the right thing to do.”\n\nHere is Chris Finch's opening statement prior to his pregame media availability on the shooting in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\n\"For the second time in less than three weeks, we've lost another member of our community in the most unimaginable way.\" pic.twitter.com/mWRhBchC3W\n\n— Dane Moore (@DaneMooreNBA) January 25, 2026\n\n“For the second time in less than three weeks, we’ve lost another beloved member of our community in the most unimaginable way,” an emotional Finch said before the game.\n\n“As an organization, we are heartbroken for what we are having to witness and endure and watch. We just want to extend our thoughts, prayers and concern for Mr. Pretti’s family, all the loved ones and everyone involved in such an unconscionable situation in a community that we really love, full of people who are, by nature, peaceful and prideful. We just stand in support of our great community here.”\n\nWarriors star Stephen Curry said he was “glued” to the TV on Friday and Saturday when they weren’t playing or practicing. He also said he has videos on his phone that he took of protesters who were walking through the streets on Friday outside of their hotel in sub-zero temperatures.\n\n“The protests that were going on downtown, it was amazing to watch the turnout,” Curry said. “The peaceful protests and unified voice that was here, you feel like that would kind of turn the tide to a more positive direction. Then you wake up in the morning and you see what happened … There's a lot of change that needs to happen, and when you’re here, you feel it.”\n\nThe Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti before the game on Sunday. Several in the crowd shouted out “F*** ICE” during the moment.\n\nMoment of silence held for Alex Pretti before today’s game. pic.twitter.com/qzbAVlFxVh\n\n— Chris Hine (@ChristopherHine) January 25, 2026\n\nWhile there were protests outside of the Target Center again on Sunday, the game went off as planned without any issues.\n\n“It’s very difficult to see so many people struggling and sad,” Kerr said. “They came to the game to try to forget about stuff, I guess, but I don’t think anything went away for the city and for their team. I think they were suffering from the effects of everything.”",

    "fullText": "Jessica Pegula sent reigning champion and podcast co-host Madison Keys spinning out of the Australian Open on Monday while Jannik Sinner aims to avoid the same fate and reach the quarter-finals in stifling heat.\n\nIn temperatures approaching 30C in Melbourne, fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti set up a last-eight showdown with Novak Djokovic.\n\nKeys and Pegula launched day nine in a clash at Rod Laver Arena between two Americans who know each other well.\n\nThey are good friends and also host a tennis podcast together, \"The Player's Box\", and had even been planning to record an episode on the eve of their match.\n\nAll that was put aside as a clinical Pegula dominated 6-3, 6-4 to set up a last-eight encounter with another American in fourth seed Amanda Anisimova.\n\nAnisimova, beaten finalist at last year's US Open and Wimbledon, cooled herself off with bags of ice before taming China's Wang Xinyu 7-6 (7/4), 6-4.\n\nPegula, the 31-year-old sixth seed, is chasing an elusive Grand Slam title, her best performance to date reaching the US Open final in 2024.\n\nAn erratic Keys made 27 unforced errors to Pegula's 17 and fired down six double faults as her title defence ended in the last 16.\n\nThe forfeit, as a part of a jokey bet with Pegula, will be a slice of apple pie with melted cheddar cheese on top.\n\n\"A bet is a bet, so I'll do it. I hope it's less gross than I think it's going to be, but we will find out,\" said Keys, who described herself as proud despite defeat.\n\nAlso in the women's draw in the fourth round, fifth seed Elena Rybakina plays 21st seed Elise Mertens of Belgium.\n\nSecond seed Iga Swiatek will be heavy favourite against Maddison Inglis.\n\nAustralian qualifier Inglis, ranked 168, features on Rod Laver Arena in the biggest match of her life.\n\nThe 28-year-old was given free passage into the last 16 when two-time Melbourne champion Naomi Osaka pulled out injured.\n\nAfter sizzling weather caused the suspension of matches on Saturday, temperatures are rising sharply again.\n\nLonger matches on Monday will have 10-minute breaks in certain circumstances as part of measures to protect player health.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to hit a blistering 44C on Tuesday, meaning matches are likely to be played under roofs on the three courts that have them.\n\nLater Monday, reigning champion Sinner — who struggles in the heat — will be strong favourite against fellow Italian Luciano Darderi.\n\nDarderi, the 22nd seed, has never made it this far at a Grand Slam while Sinner is chasing a third Australian Open crown in a row.\n\nOnly Djokovic has done that in the Open era.\n\nMelbourne Park king Djokovic was supposed to play the 20-year-old Jakub Mensik in a night match.\n\nBut the Czech player pulled out injured on Sunday, sending 10-time champion Djokovic into the last eight without hitting a ball.\n\nThe 38-year-old Serb will play Musetti after the Italian defeated American ninth seed Taylor Fritz 6-2, 7-5, 6-4.\n\nIn the last match of the day on centre court, United States eighth seed Ben Shelton plays Norway's 12th seed Casper Ruud in the timeslot when Djokovic was supposed to be on court.",

    "fullText": "While Minnesota is supercharged with emotions, Stephen Curry demonstrated physical grit of his own. Before he lent heartfelt support to the grieving community that’s rattled by the death of Alex Pretti on Saturday (the day the game was originally scheduled for), Curry led the Warriors to a 111-85 win. All while powering through injuries, getting hurt again, and adding another historic knotch to his resume.\n\nCurry revealed he was following the goings-on in Minnesota while he spent Saturday resting his knee after the game was cancelled. He was listed as questionable before Sunday’s rescheduled game. But he played 28 minutes and was instrumental in the Dubs’ turnaround. Another player stepped on his toe, but that didn’t seem to slow him down.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the Dubs and Wolves have a back-to-back rematch tomorrow. When asked if he would be available tomorrow, Curry said, “If everything goes well, yeah. With the recovery and all that, the minutes tonight weren’t crazy, so hopefully I respond well.”\n\nWhen the Golden State Warriors landed in Minnesota yesterday, some of the players got their workouts in before the game was canceled. The point guard hurt his knee during that. “Kind of something flared up yesterday when we came over to get a workout in. It was super weird,” he revealed.\n\nBut his personal injury update is a lot more concerning when he reveals some persistent issues. “I’ve had stuff going on with quads and whatnot, but it was something that I hadn’t felt before. So, I definitely took advantage of the day off to get right, but hopefully that continues.”\n\nAfter Jimmy Butler’s season-ending ACL tear, followed by Jonathan Kuminga’s indefinite break for bone bruising, the last thing Dub Nation can deal with is an injured Steph. Tomorrow De’Anthony Melton and Al Horford sit out for injury management and fans wouldn’t mind if Steph joined them. Moving up the all-time scoring ladder can wait a little longer.\n\nDespite battling injuries, Stephen Curry had an impressive 26 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists, and 4 steals. That alone carried him to the 19th spot on the NBA’s All-time Scoring list. He passed John Havlicek and tied Paul Pierce for cracking the top 20 with 26,397 points in his career.\n\nHe’s only 99 points away from catching up to Tim Duncan next. So far this season, Curry has averaged 27.3 points, 5.0 assists, and 3.7 rebounds while shooting 46.8% from the field and 39.8% from the arc.\n\nAnalysts predict he’d crack top 10 soon enough. They, in fact, think he would’ve done it a long time ago had it not been for his injury history that also kept him underpaid for a period of time.\n\nTonight, Curry limped during the empty moments and yet he carried the offense. If he aggravates what is now a sore knee and ends up missing more than one game, the Warriors’ offense will be diminished.\n\nFor now even Steve Kerr is hopeful that Curry will be cleared to play. Steph is still listed as questionable for Monday and they’ve left his status as a game-time decision.\n\nThe post Stephen Curry Shares Worrying Injury Update After Historic NBA Achievement Against Timberwolves appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "UFC 324 did more than just try to reshuffle the flyweight rankings; it also revived old grudges and established new ones overnight. One knockout in the prelims sent shockwaves across the division, and the fallout quickly spread on social media. What should have been a quiet night for the champion Joshua Van, watching the fight at home, evolved into a digital sparring match, revealing exactly how heated the title picture has become.\n\nFor ‘The Fearless,’ the timing was almost too perfect. As fans processed Charles Johnson‘s defeat at UFC 324, the champion casually shared a tweet that cut harder than it looked. With a laughing emoji and a simple caption, a long-awaited rematch wasn’t just delayed—it felt erased.\n\nJoshua Van’s tweet wasn’t subtle. “Uhh ohh, there goes the rematch\n\n,” he wrote, a direct dig at Charles Johnson—the only man to knock him out in the UFC. Given their history, it felt like a reminder: momentum is vital, and timing can be cruel. Johnson had spent months suggesting that he still found flaws in Van’s game.\n\nBut UFC 324 effectively sealed that door that led to the rematch, at least for the time being. That’s when Manel Kape joined the chat. Clearly furious, ‘Staryboy’ denied any suggestion that Van was looking past him, arguing that the champion only got to this point because he stepped in during Kape’s injury absence.\n\nIn a fiery tweet, he wrote, “Don’t forget this: you’re only in this position because I broke my foot and you replaced me against Brandon Royval. Everyone saw what happened once I came back from injury.” He further added, “So stop this rematch bulls—. He knocked u out cold; there is no rematch. You’re fighting me. Give me four weeks. That’s all I need to put u back in diapers.”\n\nVan’s response? He didn’t bite emotionally; he corrected the record. “Shut up u didn’t wanna sign the contract\n\n,” he replied dismissively. And honestly, his version checks out. As per reports, after UFC 324 lost its original co-headliner between women’s bantamweight champion Kayla Harrison and Amanda Nunes, Van got the call.\n\nAnd while the champion refused to confirm or deny it, he did hint that Kape turned down a fight against him at some point. He told MMA Junkie. “Ask him. He would know. Last time I checked, the champ said yes, and the challenger said no.” The 24-year-old further added, “One guy is running.”\n\nWhile UFC 324 did not crown his next opponent, it did clarify one thing: ‘The Fearless’ is not seeking validation. He’s watching the division sort itself out and waiting for someone to volunteer. And if Manel Kape is to be believed, he is ready for the fight and has a lot planned for the title fight already.\n\nThat confidence Joshua Van has been projecting is exactly what Manel Kape seems to be feeding off. Unlike ‘The Fearless,’ who has chosen to be more measured, Kape has taken the opposite approach by being loud, dismissive, and certain that this matchup will end one way. In his opinion, this is not a debate about contenders or timing. It’s a stylistic mismatch waiting to be exposed.\n\n‘Starboy’ did not mince words when talking about Joshua Van to MMA Junkie. He pitched the potential title bout as routine business rather than a challenge, relying primarily on the idea that Van’s striking plays into his hands. Kape believes his current run of knockouts has already revealed the disparity, claiming that even high-volume competitors were unable to touch him once he found his groove.\n\nTo him, Van represents movement without consequence. “To be honest, I see Joshua Van as a punching bag. For my fight, I think I only have to go to the gym and punch the bag. That’s the fight that I’m going to have. A hard punching bag. What I’m going to land whatever I want. Of course, this punching bag is going to throw something, but I’m going to avoid.”\n\nWhat makes Manel Kape’s pitch interesting isn’t the trash talk, but the conviction behind it. He’s promising control wrapped in violence, a mano-o-mano that looks exciting but is ultimately one-sided. In fact, even the date or location doesn’t seem to matter much to him either. He says all the promotion has to do is pick the date and send the contract.\n\n“Let’s go March 8 [at UFC 326],” Kape suggested. “That’s the date. But I don’t mind to fight in Houston. I don’t mind to be a title [fight] co-main event. I know this doesn’t happen, but I don’t mind this.” The question of whether that confidence is prophetic or premature remains unanswered. But one thing is certain: if this fight takes place, Manel Kape’s side will be full of belief, and that alone ensures fans that the tension will keep on building.\n\nThe post Joshua Van Unfazed by Manel Kape’s Fiery Response After UFC 324 Result Costs Him a Major Rematch appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

A three-time Super Bowl champ with the Patriots as a player, he has a chance to become the first person in NFL history to win a Super Bowl as a player and a coach with the same franchise.\n\nTo do that, they’ll have to go through the Seattle Seahawks, who are out for revenge after narrowly losing their last Super Bowl appearance to New England on Malcolm Butler’s goal-line interception 11 years ago. The Seahawks will have to overcome that painful history along with Sam Darnold’s embarrassing 0-4 career record against the Patriots.\n\nDarnold will need to step up against New England’s historically good defense, which is averaging just 8.7 points per game allowed in these playoffs. Meanwhile, the Patriots have already beaten three elite defenses this postseason, so there’s no reason they can’t defeat another.\n\nSam Darnold’s Mind‑Boggling Stat Vs.

    "fullText": "Jessica Pegula avoided wearing a Kansas City Chiefs jersey as she defeated Madison Keys to end her fellow podcast host’s Australia Open title defence.\n\nPegula will play another American in fourth seed Amanda Anisimova in the quarter-finals after reaching the last-eight in Melbourne for the fourth time.\n\nThe 31-year-old sixth seed is good friends with Keys, who won her first grand slam title at the Australian Open last year, and they host The Player's Box podcast together along with Jennifer Brady and Desirae Krawczyk.\n\nThey recorded an episode before their fourth-round match, and decided the winner would choose a forfeit for the loser.\n\nKeys decided that if she won, Pegula, whose parents own the NFL team the Buffalo Bills, would have had to wear a Chiefs jersey with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift on the back.\n\nIn ensuring she avoided wearing the colours of the source of Buffalo’s recent post-season woes, Pegula will instead make Keys eat an apple pie topped with melted cheese.\n\n“I had a lot of motivation today,” Pegula said after her 6-3 6-4 victory over Keys, with the pair remaining in good spirits as they were seen chatting in the gym post-match as Pegula avoided the forfeit.\n\n“That was bad,\" said Pegula. \"She was, like, 'Mine's worse'. I was, like, 'What are you talking about? My family owns the Bills. This team has owned us in the post-season'.\n\n“All she has to do is eat a piece of pie. What is the big deal? I think that was really some extra motivation, because that would have been a tough moment for me.”\n\nPegula said the apple pie topped with cheddar cheese was her family's Thanksgiving tradition.\n\n\"A bet is a bet, so I'll do it,\" said Keys. \"I hope it's less gross than I think it's going to be, but we will find out, I guess.\"\n\nKeys, meanwhile, is set to drop out of the world’s top 10 after her fourth-round exit but said she was proud of how she had handle the experience of returning as defending champion.\n\n“It's obviously not the way that I wanted things to end here, but I'm still really proud of myself,” Keys said\n\n“I think coming back, being defending champion, dealing with all of the extra pressure and nerves, I'm just really proud of myself for how I handled it.\n\n“Just one of those days where I feel like Jess beat me, and I can kind of walk away with my head held high.”\n\nPegula is bidding to win her first grand slam title, having coming closest at the US Open with an appearance in the final and semi-finals in the last two seasons.\n\nBut she is yet to drop a set so far and will be confident when she meets another US Open runner-up in Anisimova, who is bidding to win her first grand slam title after defeats in the finals of Wimbledon and the US Open last season.\n\n“I'm just really happy that the work that I've done with my coaches,” Pegula said. “I really believe in that and what we have done, and to be able to kind of execute that stuff in a grand slam, second tournament of the year for me, will give me a lot of confidence, not just here but just going into the year.\n\n“I have always been the type of player where I get frustrated when I feel like I'm not getting better. And I still think that at my age, I've already had a lot of really great results. Being 31, I still feel like I'm improving as a player. So that is what gets me the most excited.”",

    "fullText": "Worldwide, heat waves are becoming less unusual. It's no longer possible to ignore sweltering summer temperatures or to dismiss them as one-off anomalies.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the Australian Open tennis tournament, scheduled for the second half of January amid peak summer weather in the Southern Hemisphere, has been forced to rearrange some of its matches and adjust court assignments in anticipation of 100-degree afternoon temperatures in Melbourne.\n\nThe tournament has shifted its morning start time earlier by an hour, making room for an additional match in Margaret Court Arena — one of only three available indoor courts.\n\nIt's not the first time the Australian Open has had to account for intolerable weather conditions. In 2019, per the Times, the tournament introduced a \"Heat Stress Scale\" to account for \"the four climate factors — air temperature, radiant heat or the strength of the sun, humidity, and wind speed — which affect a player's ability to disperse heat from their body.\"\n\nIn addition to being unbearable for athletes active at the time, these high summer temperatures are symptomatic of a climate that's changing for the worse.\n\nSouth Australia fire chief Brett Loughlin told the Guardian that the recent temperature extremes rank among \"some of the most significant fire weather forecasts we have seen in South Australia in recent years.\"\n\nWarm summers and isolated weather phenomena on their own may not be much cause for concern, but their mounting severity in recent decades points to a broader pattern. Human activity is the principal driving force behind our current climate crisis, with industrial and residential greenhouse gas trapping heat within our atmosphere as our natural carbon sinks — that is, oceans and forests — fall victim to pollution and urbanization.\n\nWhile Australia endures a torrid summer, much of the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing an abnormally warm, dry winter. Meanwhile, the occasional extreme cold snap — contrary to popular belief — is just another way in which the climate catastrophe can manifest, as Arctic melting temporarily shifts the bitterly cold polar vortex southward.\n\nThe Australian Open may be moving tennis schedules to accommodate this alarming heat, but our warming climate has begun affecting athletes and nonathletes around the world — and likely will for decades to come. New carbon capture technologies and efforts to preserve the longevity of our forests and oceans can go a long way, but in the end, it's collective action that can make a real difference.\n\nFor your part, try taking public transit instead of your private combustion vehicle to work every day. Consider upgrading your appliances to energy-efficient alternatives or even installing an eco-friendly solar energy system. Even though it may not seem like much, individual choices do add up for the better.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale.",
    "fullText": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale. He was labeled a bust with the New York Jets, flamed out in Carolina, faded into the background in San Francisco, and was ultimately discarded by the Minnesota Vikings. Eight seasons later, that narrative is officially dead.\n\nOn Sunday night, Darnold delivered the defining performance of his career, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a 31–27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game. The victory sends Seattle to Super Bowl LX. And sends Darnold’s critics scrambling.\n\n“I mean, he just shut a lot of people up tonight,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said after the game. “So I’m really happy for him.”\n\nDarnold was sensational from start to finish, matching throws with MVP candidate Matthew Stafford on the game’s biggest stage. He connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a momentum-swinging touchdown with 20 seconds left in the first half, flipping the game in Seattle’s favor.\n\nFollowing a disastrous Rams special teams mistake, Darnold capitalized by firing a strike to Jake Bobo over the middle for another score. Later, he ripped a perfectly placed spiral through Los Angeles’ zone coverage to Cooper Kupp for a 13-yard touchdown, the play that ultimately proved decisive.\n\nThe performance was a masterclass in poise and precision. Darnold finished 25-of-36 passing with zero interceptions, repeatedly delivering when the moment demanded it most.\n\nSeattle complemented Darnold’s brilliance with timely defense and game-changing special teams. Devon Witherspoon made back-to-back pass breakups inside the six-yard line late in the fourth quarter, forcing a turnover on downs that kept the Rams off the scoreboard.\n\nOn special teams, the Seahawks forced two muffed punts from Rams returner Xavier Smith, recovering the second to set up Darnold’s touchdown pass to Bobo.\n\n“It’s a team win,” Macdonald said. “And then, you can’t talk about the game without talking about our quarterback.”\n\nFor Darnold, this marks his first NFC Championship win as a starter. He previously earned a conference title as a backup with the 49ers during their Super Bowl run two years ago, but this one was different — this one was his.\n\nAfter five teams, nearly 3,000 pass attempts, and almost eight full seasons in the league, Darnold has become the first quarterback from the vaunted 2018 draft class, which included Baker Mayfield and MVPs Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson, to win a conference championship as a starter.\n\nWhen his best was required, Sam Darnold delivered it. Two weeks from now in Santa Clara, he’ll have a chance to put the final stamp on a career resurrection that once seemed impossible.\n\nThe post Seahawks News: Mike Macdonald Says Sam Darnold “Shut a Lot of People Up” With 3-TD Game vs. Rams appeared first on The SportsRush.",

A little over a year after completing her first Hyrox, she was part of a quartet who set a women's world record in London in December 2025.\n\nHow Hyrox became the latest sporting craze\n\nHyrox: The new fitness trend sweeping the capital\n\nHyrox comprises of 8km of running with eight exercise stations in between.\n\nCompetitors endure 1km on a standing ski machine, 50m sled push, 50m sled pull, 80m burpee jumps, 1km indoor rowing, 200m kettlebell carry, 100m sandbag lunges, and to finish, 100 throws and catches of a medicine ball.\n\n\"I've always been involved in sport in my whole life really,\" Stockley said.\n\n\"I was a competitive swimmer and runner from a young age.\n\n\"When I went to university I enjoyed a lot of hockey but after that I got into a bit of CrossFit, so I've sort of done everything.\n\n\"With CrossFit I enjoyed the Olympic lifting but it compromised my running quite a bit and that's when I saw Hyrox as this big fitness event and thought I'd like to give that a go.\"\n\nStockley's Hyrox debut came at an open event in Birmingham with her performance earning her qualification for the World Championships in Chicago.\n\n\"I was like 'right I actually need to do a bit of training for this,'\" she said.\n\n\"I did first pro in Glasgow, the weights increased and I won that in my age group.\n\n\"I was fifth in my age group at World Champs in 2025 and it's been going in a nice trajectory ever since.\"\n\nIn her first year of professional Hyrox races, Stockley could have been forgiven for easing herself into the sport, but by the year's end she had set a world record alongside Alexandra Hill, Saskia Geddes and Allana Falconer.\n\n\"I'd met them before but we'd never actually raced together so we were sort of put together in this team,\" Stockley recalled.\n\n\"It was never an aim for us [to set a world record]. We were always going to give it a good go, it was the last race of London Hyrox, so it was like, 'right let's do this.'\n\n\"We looked up at the board and said 'oh my gosh I think this is a world record', it was a surprise but we went as hard as we could.\n\n\"Once we'd finished I think the realisation set in and the announcer realised 'oh my God this is a world record'\".\n\nStockley is now preparing for the Elite 15 competition in Phoenix, Arizona which serves as one of four Hyrox majors.\n\nThe State Farm Stadium, home to NFL's Arizona Cardinals, will serve as host for the event, with Stockley competing in the singles on 29 January before returning two days later for the age group doubles.\n\nThe top three finishers at each earn automatic qualification to June's World Championships in Sweden.\n\nStockley says competition will be fierce.\n\n\"To be with those top girls, they're running under that hour mark so that's definitely a goal,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Kenneth Walker III, Jaxon Smith-Njigba lead list of Big Ten stars in Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots has a chance to be one of the best in recent memory. As such, it is a prime opportunity for some former Big Ten stars to show out on one of the biggest stages in sports.\n\nMore specifically, among the Seahawks, four former Big Ten players stand out, each with a uniquely different path to where they are today. Those would be Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, cornerback Devon Witherspoon and quarterback Sam Darnold.\n\nFor those who may have forgotten, Smith-Njigba was a one-man show at Ohio State with an electrifying offensive presence around him. In 2021, he had a breakout season for the Buckeyes with 1,606 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, Walker III was as reliable as ever on Michigan State teams that were a far cry from what fans in the mid-2010s were used to. In his one season with Michigan State before heading off to the NFL, he scored 19 total touchdowns\n\nMORE: Jaxon Smith-Njigba joins elite club with absurd record in Seahawks-Rams NFC Championship\n\nNow he's duplicating his collegiate success in the NFLas he scored a touchdown in Sunday's NFC Championship en route to a 31-27 win against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSignaling out the many accolades that make Darnold one of the NFL's best comeback stories in recent memory, the fact that he is the first-ever ex-USC Trojan set to start a Super Bowl is truly remarkable.\n\nConcerning Witherspoon, it just goes to show that Illinois coach Bret Bielema's model of \"sustained success\" and wearing the developmental program mantra with pride is what makes Witherspoon's success story as memorable as ever.\n\nIn fact, he may just be the unsung hero who put the Seahawks in a position to win to begin with.\n\nNonetheless, all four stars are just four of a select few that will have a chance to make their mark on NFL history for years to come.\n\nMORE: Why Fernando Mendoza would be 'so grateful' to be selected by 'any team' in NFL draft\n\nIn 12 days, we'll see how far they come.\n\nCurt Cignetti says what every college football fan can agree on fresh off Indiana's title\n\nBret Bielema rips AP voters after Illinois football was shelved over Big Ten team it beat\n\nCollege football analyst rips those in denial of Curt Cignetti's, Indiana's success\n\nCollege football pundit shares shocking Ohio State football ranking amid 2026 off-season",

    "fullText": "Barcelona will be busy in the final week of the winter transfer window, both in terms of signings and exits. Regarding the latter, the most notable will be Dro Fernandez, who is poised to join Paris Saint-Germain in the coming days.\n\nEarlier this month, Dro handed in a transfer request, which was met with a lot of surprise – and anger – within Barcelona. PSG are close to agreeing a deal to sign the 18-year-old midfielder, who was promoted to the first team last summer after impressing Hansi Flick during pre-season.\n\nThe club’s general feeling towards the Dro situation was made clear by president Joan Laporta, who was asked for his reaction when speaking on Catalunya Radio on Sunday, as per MD.\n\n“We will talk about it when it is fully done. He has announced that he will not continue. It is an unpleasant situation. We will be able to redirect the situation as it had been proposed. It has been a surprise. We had agreed on another solution for Dro by the time he turned 18 and surprisingly his agent told us that we couldn’t deliver on what we had agreed upon. We will try to make it end as well as possible in the interest of Barça.”\n\nBarcelona had high hopes for Dro, as Laporta has now made clear. He would have been a player for the first team for many years to come, where he would have been competing alongside the likes of Fermin Lopez and Dani Olmo, as well as fellow La Masia star Guille Fernandez.\n\nBut even more than this, the real kicker for Barcelona is losing Dro for such a small amount. A deal is expected to be finalised for around €8m, which is far below their valuation of the teenage talent.",

    "description": "It’s time to refocus, and with players coming and going at Sunderland this week, will we be sat here this time next week in a stronger position?",
    "fullText": "There’s no denying that Saturday afternoon was probably as bad as it has gotten for us so far this season. We were, to be pretty blunt, crap.\n\nWe’re allowed to be crap occasionally, though, aren’t we? No team is perfect. We were expected to spectacularly struggle this season, and yet here we are, sitting as the only undefeated home side in the division. That’s why, about five minutes after full time, I was able to just shrug it off and look forward, not back.\n\nUntil heavy defeats become a habit, I’ll not be panicking. And before someone says it, no, I’m not pontificating here — this is generally just my default position when it comes to Sunderland. I take the tag of ‘supporter’ incredibly seriously, sometimes to my own detriment, but I’ll always defend the club and the decisions they take if I think they’ve been taken in good faith.\n\n10th in the best league in the world\n\n33 points\n\n15 to play\n\nUnbeaten at home \n\nOver achieving \n\nIncreased expectations \n\nLost after a poor performance \n\nChill out\n\nStay calm\n\nSupport the lads\n\nWe'll be reet\n\nRegards \n\n🔴⚪️\n\n— SJT (@tenchylad) January 24, 2026\n\nThat said, I was a little disappointed to see such an overwhelmingly hysterical reaction to the defeat after the game. I was also buoyed by reading some of the more sensible takes from fans who couldn’t understand why people were getting so carried away, but I’m sure anyone who took even just a cursory glance at the socials during and after Saturday’s game will have noted the way people took seeing Sunderland seriously underperform.\n\nThat’s not just limited to Sunderland and our fans, as fans of all clubs have this element, and it even goes beyond football — I think this is just a fact when it comes to general discourse in 2026. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be called out if you think something is wrong. I don’t and didn’t agree with some of the comments I saw about our young players, for instance, because we know that there’s a strong chance they’ll read them, and you can only wonder what that could do to their confidence. So, I’d always urge people to think twice about what they post, especially when it comes to young players who are just doing their best for Sunderland.\n\nAnyways – that’s enough of that, I’ll stop wagging my finger and telling people what to do. For now, at least.\n\nLast time #SAFC were in the Premier League, we'd win, draw or (mostly) lose, everyone would go home and crack on with their lives. Now it feels like every result is extrapolated to the extreme. Seen some extraordinary takes today 😅 it's a football match – either side can win.\n\n— Michael Potts (@MichaelPotts_) January 24, 2026\n\nReggie got it wrong at the London Stadium, and it’s not often that we’ve been able to say that, but it’s only fair to point out that he did. Although, as I said on the post-match reaction pod, when the team news dropped, I wasn’t alarmed by any of the players that he selected, so it’d be easy for me to be wise after the occasion, sitting here talking about how he shouldn’t have started Hume on the right or Mayenda up front. I thought the team he picked looked quite attacking and like a side that could go there and take it to West Ham early on, which I think was probably the plan.\n\nWhat we did — and this isn’t something we really do under this manager — is we took a big gamble. We thought we could catch West Ham off guard by approaching things in a manner in which they hadn’t planned for, and as always, the club had things spoiled the night before when it was leaked that Granit Xhaka wouldn’t be starting the game. Still, they tried to keep people guessing by posting videos of him travelling with the team by train and then using his image to promote the match early in the morning. Still, I think by that point it had already gotten out that Granit was going to miss the match, and you have to imagine that got back to West Ham.\n\nThey were like a pack of Hyenas knowing our talisman was missing, and they smelled blood. I have to admit that this is something which worries me about the games coming up. With Granit Xhaka on the pitch, virtually everyone we face fears us, but without him, you can’t help but admit we are significantly weaker.\n\nDo the club need to get a tighter grip on news leaking out? I’d say so. This isn’t the first time this season that a significant piece of team news has filtered through the fanbase on the eve of a game (it happened with Diarra too), and whilst people are keen to know what’s going on, the only people that it benefits are the teams we are facing, who get a leg up and know what to prepare for.\n\nAlong the same lines, it’s probably really important that in such a big week, a lid is kept on our transfer activity too. In the summer the club had several of their deals spoiled by staff members or freelancers who couldn’t keep things buttoned and it didn’t go down well — you might remember that pictures from Granit Xhaka’s photoshoot were leaked way before it was confirmed that he had signed, which you can imagine will have enraged people at the club who always want to deliver this information on their terms. Whether it’s team news or signings, if it’s within our control, we have to stop fuelling the social media rumour mill (and yes, guilty, we here at RR probably help to contribute to that too, but it’s not our job to contain it!) and keep things tight until it’s the right time to let people know — let’s see if that’s the case as the week progresses.\n\nAfter a heavy defeat, you can imagine that it refocuses people. We won’t panic — I don’t think we’re about to make any rash changes in the transfer market as a result of losing one game of football — but it’s often said you learn a lot more about your team after a defeat, and that’s likely to be the case after West Ham, too. It may well be that question marks were hanging over several players, and minds have been made up in the wake of the game. It may well be that we were humming and harring over signing a quality additional midfield player with experience, but having seen how desperately we missed Granit on Saturday, we’ve realised that we need more options if we’re going to finish the season strongly. Let’s wait and see.\n\nWhat’s true is that it’s going to be a bloody long week until we face Burnley. When you get tonked, I always think it’s better if we have another game quickly afterwards so we can just put things right, and I bet that the players in training this week will be absolutely itching to get back to it. However, the Academy of Light will also serve as a stage for significant change, with established and popular players like Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson expected to depart to continue their careers elsewhere. It seems inevitable that both men will leave, and whilst our focus should be on moving forward and to the next game, I do have to wonder what effect losing two popular lads will have on the dressing room. I’m sure their mates will be upset, but it’s all part of the process of growing as a club, and we’ve got to move on.\n\nThe end result, I hope, is that even greater players come through the door in their place and they slot in just as quickly as their contemporaries did over the summer.",

    "description": "Arsenal 2-3 Manchester United: Patrick Dorgu’s stunning volley helped Michael Carrick to deal the league leaders a first home defeat of the season, one week on from ecstasy on derby day",
    "fullText": "There’s an air of Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer to the beginning of this latest interim era at Manchester United. So much has been talked about the club’s missing “DNA”, whatever that may consist of. But under the guidance of Michael Carrick, United are winning big games again - something that historically reflects “The Manchester United Way” - and just like under Solskjaer, a player reborn is at the heart of things.\n\nWith Solskjaer, that was a 21-year-old Marcus Rashford, revitalised after being misused out wide by Jose Mourinho. With Carrick, it’s Patrick Dorgu. The Dane has found new life in a United shirt since being moved forward into a winger role, a year on from being signed as a defensive solution by Ruben Amorim. His instrumental performance against the Gunners, including a screamer that few could have conceived, acted as further proof that he has spent the last 12 months held back by the now former United boss.\n\n\"Pat’s been a big player for us over the last couple of games attacking-wise - he’s scored two goals, but in terms of his threat and athleticism and his quality coming in as well,” Carrick said. “Delighted for him. His two goals (against Arsenal and Manchester City) are very different goals but you get that because he’s put so much into the performances. It’s nice to see him smiling and happy.”\n\nThe early stages held a mirror to Dorgu’s ghost of Old Trafford past. So much of Arsenal’s early joy was coming down the right flank and Dorgu was forced to return to his old post further back, soon finding himself fighting a losing battle against Bukayo Saka.\n\nIt was that duel that sparked the Gunners’ opener, with Saka calmly dinking it over the jockeying player’s leg to Martin Odegaard, who forced the issue by firing it into the six yard box occupied by Jurrien Timber and Lisandro Martinez, attached at the hip. Paul Scholes had warned Martinez not to get too high and mighty on his horse after impressing in last week’s derby and perhaps the Argentinian should have listened, with Odegaard’s pass bouncing off Martinez’s heel and into his own net. “When you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a**e,” Scholes said. He was spot on.\n\nBut from the moment Arsenal took the advantage, they too became seemingly intent on being the architects of their own downfall. Bryan Mbeumo found himself bearing down on goal right from the restart as the Gunners gave it away sloppily in midfield, but they were let off when Bruno Fernandes wildly blasted wide from the pull-back.\n\nMbeumo, United’s top scorer in his maiden season at Old Trafford, maybe should have gone alone and he made sure not to repeat the error when a similar chance was presented to him on a silver platter by the opposition. With the United press closing in, Martin Zubimendi panicked receiving a hospital pass from William Saliba and in trying to play it back to his goalkeeper, the Spaniard set Mbeumo - in his direct eyeline as he played the ball - clean through, with the Cameroonian rounding David Raya to equalise.\n\n“We gave them the goal,” Arteta lamented, struggling to pinpoint why errors proliferated among his players as they allowed United back into the contest. “Errors are a part of football. It was very unlike us but we gave them the goal and hope, and that shifted the energy.” And with renewed spirits, accompanied by the impetus of their new weapon, the visitors came out swinging in the second half.\n\nThough shaky at the back, Dorgu has looked like a new signing going forward. It was something we saw against Newcastle while Ruben Amorim was still in charge, making you wonder just why the stubborn Portuguese boss dragged him back to left wing-back before his eventual sacking. It was in line with his inability to adapt, even when better alternatives were staring him in the face.\n\nDorgu’s stunning volley five minutes after the restart, crashing in off the underside of Raya’s bar, put an exclamation mark on the error of Amorim’s ways. While Arsenal were far too easily cut open by the link-up of Dorgu and Fernandes, it would be unfair to pin such a spectacular effort on defensive shortcomings. “You get them where it kind of takes your breath away,” Carrick said.\n\nDorgu often found himself the furthest United player up the pitch. He had been allowed to abandon his defensive duties, with Carrick aware that the opposition half was where he belonged. That was until he was forced off with a suspected hamstring injury, though Carrick is hopeful it’s nothing serious. “He ended up coming off with a little bit of cramp, hopefully it’s nothing worse. At this stage it’s hard to tell so we’ll just have to wait and see, but we’re hoping it’s not too bad.”\n\nSet pieces appeared to come to Arsenal’s rescue once again as Mikel Merino forced the ball over the line in the 84th minute after a goal-mouth scramble. That was their 15th from a set play this season in England’s top flight. Avoiding defeat would have been a huge let-off for the league leaders who, under fresh pressure from Aston Villa after their win at Newcastle earlier in the day, had not particularly threatened after falling behind.\n\nBut a piece of individual brilliance from Matheus Cunha three minutes later, who found himself in space to unleash a curler after three Arsenal bodies committed and failed to shut down Kobbie Mainoo, sealed the Gunners’ first home defeat of the season.\n\n“We’re going to win the league,” sung the jubilant away end at full-time. They might be getting a bit ahead of themselves. But as Arsenal’s lead at the top was reduced to four points, seeds of doubt may have been planted into whether the Gunners will achieve that elusive feat.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City returned to winning ways on Saturday as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola’s side will be happy to have put consecutive defeats behind them as they now prepare for their final Champions League league phase fixture against Galatasaray. City must beat the Turkish giants to have any chance of finishing in the top eight of the Champions League league phase table. Pep Guardiola has provided an update on the injury status of his squad. The City manager will have to get creative to deal with the players who are unavailable for the Galatasaray match.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s win over Wolves, Pep Guardiola has provided an update on the fitness of his squad for their crucial clash with Galatasaray. The Manchester City manager revealed that Nico will miss the match, as will Rodri through suspension. Speaking on which players will miss Manchester City’s clash with  Galatasaray, in quotes relayed by Hayters TV, Guardiola said: “I know Marc (Guehi) cannot play, Antoine (Semenyo) cannot play, Rodri cannot play, apart from all the players that we have sidelined.”\n\n“Nico Gonzalez will not be ready and Savinho will not be ready and John Stones will not be ready.”\n\nIt is a massive blow for Manchester City to be without Rodri and Nico for their crucial Champions League fixture against Galatasaray. Both players are integral to City’s play. Nico has been superb this season, although, frustratingly, he has been sidelined due to a knock that he sustained in  Manchester City’s 1-all draw with Brighton. Rodri is suspended for the match against Galatasaray after being sent off in Manchester City’s 3-1 defeat to Bodø/Glimt last week. But there does look to be one obvious solution to the issue for Pep Guardiola.\n\nNico O’Reilly is the prime candidate to partner Bernardo Silva in Manchester City’s midfield against Galatasaray. O’Reilly played as a number six in City’s recent 2-nil win over Newcastle United. He played well and didn’t look out of place in midfield. O’Reilly’s energy and athleticism could prove vital against Galatasaray. If O’Reilly were to start in midfield, either Rayan Ait-Nouri or Nathan Ake could start at left-back. Nico O’Reilly has made the left-back position his own this season, but it is highly likely that O’Reilly will be needed in midfield against Galatasaray. So, it seems that Ait-Nouri or Ake will more than likely get the opportunity at left-back.\n\nManchester City will be without Nico and Rodri for their crucial Champions League fixture against Galatasaray. That is a blow for Pep Guardiola’s side. But there does seem to be an obvious option for Pep Guardiola to use in midfield. That is Nico O’Reilly. The young England international now looms as an important player in a match that City must win on Wednesday night at the Etihad.",

Their most recent battle came in the Athens final late last season, as Djokovic won his 101st career title in a three-hour battle.\n\nBefore then, Djokovic also defeated Musetti in the semi-finals of Wimbledon and the Paris Olympics, in two of their four meetings from the 2024 season, while the 23-year-old’s only win came on clay in Monte Carlo in 2023.\n\nDjokovic, who is aiming to win the 25th grand slam title of his career, will have the added bonus of extra recovery time after the 16th seed Mensik withdrew from the tournament with an abdominal injury.\n\n“This is a tough one to write. After doing everything we could to keep going, I have to withdraw from the Australian Open due to an abdominal muscle injury that has progressed over the last matches,” said Mensik, who beat Djokovic in the Miami final last season.\n\n\"After a long discussion with my team and doctors, we decided not to step on court tomorrow.\n\n“Even though I'm disappointed, making the fourth round here for the first time is something I will carry with me for a long time. I felt so much energy from the fans and the atmosphere in Melbourne was truly special.”\n\nDjokovic had previously spoken of the importance of conserving energy in the grand slams after admitting he “ran out of gas” in his US Open semi-final defeat to Jannik Sinner last year.\n\n“There's always something that is happening with the body, but I think generally I feel as good as I have felt in a while,” Djokovic said after his third-round win over Botic van de Zandschulp, where he narrowly avoided being defaulted from the tournament after striking a ball near the head of a ball girl.\n\n\"I cannot predict the future, I don't know how things are going to unfold from this day onwards, but I'm doing everything I can.\"",

    "description": "The Sky Sports pundit praised Carrick’s influence on the club after wins over Man City and Arsenal but believes they need a ‘bigger’ manager",
    "fullText": "Roy Keane shut down suggestions that Michael Carrick be given the role of Manchester United manager on a permanent basis following the 3-2 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nCarrick took over from the sacked Ruben Amorim on a contract until the end of the current suggestion with the executives at Old Trafford currently searching for a new manager to hire permanently.\n\nIn his first game in charge Carrick orchestrated a 2-0 derby win over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City before masterminding United’s victory over the league leaders.\n\nKeane was quick to praise the impact Carrick and his staff have had on the players and results but revealed that his preference for the next manager be someone “bigger and better” than Carrick.\n\nAsked for his opinion on the result and the performance from Manchester United, Keane echoed the words of Harry Maguire who was awarded the player of the match trophy.\n\n“Harry makes a good point, they’ve got a lot of their players back now, it’s a full group, they’ve got full weeks together and there’s no other distractions,” Keane replied. “They can focus on the league form and they’re producing.\n\n“But, as we know you win one, two games for Man Utd, fantastic. Particularly to beat City, and come to Arsenal. I felt United would get a result today, I was thinking a draw but I felt United would turn up.\n\n“They’ve got enough quality players and they’ve got momentum into their season and all of a sudden you’re thinking it’s a great chance for top four. If they play with that confidence and belief, you give the manager and the staff credit.”\n\nKeane was then pressed by fellow Sky Sports pundit Micah Richards on whether Manchester United should hire Carrick on a permanent basis already given he has led the team to wins against first and second in the league.\n\n“The job? You’re being silly now,” Keane responded. “No, he’s had two great performances but anybody can win two games. It’s what he does until the end of the season.\n\n“Even if they do get into fourth I still wouldn’t be convinced he’s the man for the job. Absolutely not. I still think they need a bigger and better manager.\n\n“But, he’s got the opportunity, what a chance it is for him and, do you know what, he’s taking it so fair play to him.”",

    "title": "What's New in Pandas 3",
    "description": "pandas 3.0 has just been released. This article uses a real‑world example to explain the most important differences between pandas 2 and...",
    "fullText": "You can connect with me on \n LinkedIn\n to discuss collaborations and work opportunities.\n\nYou can also follow me on\n Twitter,\n Bluesky and\n Mastodon.\n\npandas 3.0 has just been released. This article uses a real‑world example to\nexplain the most important differences between pandas 2 and the new pandas 3\nrelease, focusing on performance, syntax, and user experience.\n\nBefore diving into the technical details of pandas 3, it is worth providing\nsome context on how pandas is developed and what to expect from its release cycle.\n\nMany software projects develop new features in parallel between major releases.\nIf pandas followed this model, development might look like this:\n\nThis is often what users expect. In reality, pandas development follows a\ndifferent approach:\n\npandas does not develop features in parallel across major versions. Instead,\nnew features land continuously on the main development line and are included\nin the next release once they are ready (for example 2.1). As a result,\npandas 3.0 does not include everything developed since pandas 2.0 (released\nalmost three years ago), but primarily what has been added since pandas 2.3,\nwhich was released roughly six months ago.\n\nMost importantly, the pandas developers consistently prioritize backward\ncompatibility. Instead of continuously breaking APIs to improve everything\nthat can be improved, we aim to fix what can reasonably be fixed without\nforcing users to rewrite their codebases. Users maintaining large pandas\nprojects, or those who simply do not want to relearn pandas syntax every\nyear, will likely appreciate this philosophy.\n\nThe downside of this conservative approach is that pandas cannot always offer\nstate‑of‑the‑art performance or a clean and consistent API, and instead will suffer\nfrom some design decisions that made sense a couple of decades ago, but that we would\nimplement differently if we started pandas today. For users starting fresh with\ndataframe‑based projects, it is worth considering Polars,\nwhich could learn from pandas experience to deliver a dataframe library with\nimpressive performance, full Arrow support, and a cleaner and more consistent API.\n\nThat said, pandas 3 still introduces several significant changes that improve\nperformance, syntax, and the overall user experience. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nThe examples in this article use a dataset containing 2,231,577 hotel room records,\nwith the following structure:\n\nWe will start with pandas 2. Our first operation is to add the maximum number of children\na room can accommodate to the maximum number of people (adults), but only for U.S. hotels.\n\nThis produces the infamous warning:\n\nIf you have used pandas for any length of time, you have almost certainly\nseen this before. What is happening can be summarized as follows:\n\nIn practice, most users do not fully understand the underlying issue and handle\nthe warning in one of two ways (often based on advice from StackOverflow or a chatbot):\n\nThe standard solution to this class of problems is copy‑on‑write:\n\nAfter countless hours of work that began well before pandas 3, copy‑on‑write is\nnow fully implemented. The warning is gone, and all the .copy() calls in pandas\ncode can be safely avoided after moving to pandas 3.\n\nLet's revisit the same example, this time focusing on syntax rather than memory behavior.\nFor users who write pandas pipelines rather than interactively exploring data in a notebook,\nthe previous example can be rewritten using method chaining:\n\nThis style avoids repeated assignments and makes the sequence of operations explicit.\nHowever, while method chaining itself makes the code more readable, many users will find\nthis version harder to read, largely because of the required use of lambda,\nwhich is a non‑trivial pandas concept.\n\nIn pandas, column access typically uses either df.column or df[\"column\"].\nWith method chaining, however, the intermediate DataFrame object does not exist as a\nnamed variable at each step. Even if we create df, the df in the assign operation\nis not the DataFrame object at the time of assigning (with only U.S. hotel data), but\nthe original DataFrame with all rows:\n\nThe use of lambda delays evaluation so that column expressions are resolved\nagainst the correct intermediate DataFrame. While effective, this approach using\nlambda makes reading pandas code significantly harder. Other libraries such as\nPolars and PySpark address this more cleanly using a col() expression API.\n\npandas 3 introduces the same mechanism:\n\nThis is a significant step forward, making pandas code much more readable, in particular\nwhen using method chaining. But there is still room for improvement. For comparison,\nthe equivalent filter in Polars looks like this:\n\nUsing an explicit .filter() method makes the operation being performed clearer.\nExperienced Python developers will be familiar with Tim Peter's brilliant\nZen of Python which states that\n\"explicit is better than implicit\". Using df[...] for both filtering and selection is\nsurely convenient, \n\nMore importantly, pandas still relies on the bitwise & operator for combining conditions.\nIdeally, users would write condition1 and condition2, but Python reserves and for\nboolean evaluation and does not allow libraries to override it.\n\nUsing & leads to this surprising behavior:\n\nThe expression is evaluated as 1 == (1 & 2) == 2, not (1 == 1) and (2 == 2).\nThe same happens when each side of the & is a pandas expression. This is why in the previous\nexample [(pandas.col(\"property_type\") == \"hotel\") & (pandas.col(\"country\") == \"us\")] \nconditions must be carefully parenthesized.\n\nSince overriding and, or, and not is not possible in Python, and not likely to be allowed\nanytime soon, the Polars approach is probably the best it can be done. Implementing .filter() and\nallowing passing multiple conditions as different arguments is something that could be\nimplemented in pandas, and will hopefully be available to users in a future version.\n\nAnother important improvement in pandas 3 is better support for user‑defined functions (UDFs).\nIn pandas, UDFs are regular Python functions passed to methods such as .apply() or .map().\n\nIf you have used pandas for a while, you have probably heard that .apply() is considered bad practice:\n\nThis reputation is often deserved. For example, adding max_people and max_children row‑by‑row:\n\nproduces the same result as the vectorized version, but increases execution time from roughly 3 ms\nto 11 seconds (around 4,000x slower).\n\nHowever, not all problems vectorize cleanly. Consider transforming a room name such as\n\"Superior Double Room with Patio View\" into a structured string like:\n\nA fully vectorized solution quickly becomes complex and hard to maintain.\nThis implementation takes around 14 seconds with the example dataset:\n\nThe equivalent UDF is (at least in my opinion) far clearer:\n\nThis version runs in about 22 seconds, roughly 70% slower than the\nvectorized approach, but is far easier to read and maintain.\n\npandas 3 introduces a new execution interface that allows third‑party\nengines to accelerate UDFs. One example is bodo.ai,\nwhich can JIT‑compile both pure Python and pandas code:\n\nWith bodo.ai, the same code runs in around 9 seconds, less than half of\nthe time needed with the standard UDF version, and also 35% faster than\nthe vectorized version. And this speed-up is gained while retaining the\nclarity of the UDF implementation.\n\nAlthough a 35% speed‑up may not sound dramatic, JIT compilation has a\nfixed startup cost, the time to compile the code, which does not depend\non the amount of data processed later. As datasets grow larger, the\nrelative gains increase substantially. For very large datasets,\nthe difference can be dramatic. So, in this example, if we had 100\nmillion rows instead of 2, using bodo.ai would improve performance massively.\n\nCrucially, execution now happens outside pandas itself. This opens the door\nto an ecosystem of specialized execution engines. For example,\nBlosc can accelerate NumPy‑style\nworkloads using compressed memory execution, and works with pandas 3 as\nsimply as bodo, just by using engine=blosc2.jit(). Enabling this ecosystem\nadds endless possibilities. For example, bodo.ai also supports distributed\nexecution on HPC clusters, and other engines may emerge for different use-cases\nand different strategies.\n\nIf you read my earlier article pandas 2.0 and the Arrow revolution,\nyou may be wondering what became of that effort.\n\nAt the time pandas 2 was being released, the core team was committed to\nimplement a more aggressive transition to Apache Arrow. Primarily, to make\nsure users could always benefit from the performance and compatibility enhancements\nArrow provides. This would be particularly relevant for strings, where the legacy\nimplementation is really suboptimal compared to the Arrow one. Ultimately,\nthis plan was scaled back. This is in short what happened:\n\nWith an example, the new strings look like this:\n\nIn the example, the data type is the new str type, and the missing value is\nrepresented by NaN, and when comparing NaN == \"a\" the return is False.\nYou can't know whether the code above uses NumPy's objects internally, or\nArrow strings, since that depends on the environment and not the code itself.\n\nMissing values are not the float NaN anymore but pandas <NA> which is not\nexactly a value itself, but a reference to whether the value is missing or not.\nIn Arrow, a separate array is used to establish which values are missing.\nThe main difference in the example is that <NA> == \"a\" in this case returns\n<NA> and not False as the default pandas 3 implementation.\n\nI'm not personally aware of any current plan or effort to change the pandas 3\nstatus quo significantly. While the new approach is a good trade-off between\nbackward compatibility and allowing users to benefit from Arrow by default, it\ncomes with its drawbacks. Now there are 3 different ways to represent strings,\nsince the PyArrow example above is still valid in pandas 3, as it would be\nsetting dtype=\"object\" and using the original implementation. It may also not\nbe ideal for some users to have the same code running with different implementation\ndepending on whether PyArrow is installed or not. This can be tricky for example\nfor developers of other libraries, who can't make assumptions on what a pandas\nstring is internally.\n\nClearly, the users that will benefit more from the new pandas 3 strings are users\nwith existing codebases concerned about backward compatibility. While the new\nchanges are not fully backward compatible, migrating to pandas 3 should be really\nstraightforward.\n\nUsers who need a simpler and modern dataframe experience based on Arrow, and are\nless concerned about pandas legacy, Polars is a great alternative.\n\nYou can connect with me on \n LinkedIn\n to discuss collaborations and work opportunities.\n\nYou can also follow me on\n Twitter,\n Bluesky and\n Mastodon.",

    "description": "At first,  Andre Neveling found Bangkok's relentless buzz thrilling, but it became overwhelming.",
    "fullText": "As a frequent traveler, I fell in love with Thailand's diverse landscapes, rich culture, and — best of all — the food. So when I experienced career burnout in 2024 after five years in Hong Kong and needed a soft landing, Thailand felt like an instant safe haven.\n\nI knew it like the back of my hand (or so I thought), and with the introduction of the digital nomad DTV visa that same year, the leap felt like a no-brainer.\n\nLiving here has largely lived up to my expectations. Still, the shift from enthusiastic visitor to long-term resident came with challenges I hadn't anticipated.\n\nI began my new life with a three-month immersion in Bangkok, my favorite city in the world. I wanted a familiar landing pad and the festive energy. I learned that even favorites have their downsides.\n\nThe city's relentless buzz — thrilling at first — slowly became overwhelming. The constant motion, traffic, and density fueled my anxiety. In a metropolis so vast, finding genuine silence or peace felt nearly impossible. I often wanted to switch it all off, but Bangkok doesn't come with an off switch.\n\nAs a remote freelancer, I had the freedom to chase a different dream by moving to Phuket. For anyone who's ever wondered what it's like to live there, it really does feel like paradise with a permanent holiday vibe. Even so, I realized how little I'd truly known it as a tourist. I keep discovering corners I'd never seen before.\n\nThen high season arrived. My peaceful paradise transformed into an overtourism nightmare, especially in December and January. Secret beaches swarmed with festival-like crowds, and daily routines fell apart. Food deliveries took hours, shops ran out of staples, and transport apps like Grab and Bolt were overwhelmed.\n\nOn one recent beach day, I couldn't book a ride home for nearly three hours, leaving me stranded in a roadside meltdown. My Zen mood quickly gave way to frustration.\n\nIronically, on an island packed with people, making real connections has felt harder than in Bangkok. With tourists constantly coming and going, most interactions are fleeting. Expat communities exist, but they're scattered and often divided by nationality. Even amid the crowds, island life can feel surprisingly lonely.\n\nThen there's the bureaucracy. Thailand operates with a certain fluidity that can be confusing. Laws around visas, business, and property don't change often, but their interpretation can vary wildly between offices, officers, and provinces.\n\nTake the 90-day reporting rule. It requires expats to report to immigration every 90 days, an outdated system that often pushes people to do quick \"visa runs\" instead of spending a full day in line. Many newcomers don't learn about it until they're hit with a hefty fine.\n\nI've since joined expat groups just to keep up with the ever-shifting rules.\n\nThailand's sex industry is impossible to ignore in heavy tourist zones. Living here, I've had to build a certain emotional distance from it. When I first arrived in Phuket, I stayed in a room next to a tourist who was clearly there for that purpose. For a week straight, I was an unwilling audience to noisy transactions — until I finally complained to management.\n\nAnd as a foreigner, you're often placed in the \"tourist\" box by default. I thought Tinder might be a way to meet people. Instead, half my matches offered a \"massage\" rather than a conversation.\n\nThailand is known for its affordability, but a clear divide still exists between local and foreign pricing. You have to stay vigilant to avoid overpaying. The reward comes with time. As I've settled in and become a regular at local markets and shops, I'm now greeted with smiles — and the occasional \"special price.\"\n\nThat, in the end, is what makes all the headaches fade.\n\nFor every moment of frustration, there are many more filled with beauty, incredible food, and genuine kindness. The trade-offs are real, and the challenges come with the territory.\n\nBut most days, when I look around at the place I now call home, the struggles feel like a small price to pay for living in a real-life paradise.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "fullText": "Anna Kendrick, 40, says watching her friends go to college made her second-guess her decision to pursue acting.\n\n\"I was really, really jealous of all my friends that were going to college. Number one, because I felt really insecure about not going to college. I have a whole, you know, complex about it,\" Kendrick said on Friday's episode of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nSeeing her friends quickly build community through classes and sororities made her feel even more unsure as she tried to find her footing in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I was 17 or 18. It's really hard to make friends in LA because of, like, the way the city is laid out, but especially when you don't have a fake ID. Even if I did, I looked about 12, so that wasn't going to work anyway,\" Kendrick said. \"And I was just like absolutely terrified and really wondering if I was like, making a huge mistake.\"\n\nHer perspective began to change when her friends hit sophomore year and had to start figuring out their future paths.\n\n\"Even though the thing that I wanted felt like a total pipe dream, and like, 'What am I doing? This is a disaster. It's so hard to carve out a space for yourself in this industry,'\" Kendrick said.\n\n\"But on the other side of it, holy shit, I did not think like, what a blessing to just know what I want. I was like watching all my friends go, 'Oh my god, I don't know what I want, what to do,'\" she continued.\n\nThe \"Pitch Perfect\" star said her decision not to go to college felt especially difficult because it went against the path her family valued.\n\n\"I was like the first person to not go to college. And my dad was a teacher and everything, so it was like very black sheep behavior to not go to college,\" Kendrick said.\n\nShe added her parents weren't thrilled with her decision, but accepted that she was going to do what she wanted. At the same time, her parents saw college as something she could revisit if acting didn't work out.\n\n\"I think there was always that sense of like, well, if things maybe don't work out that first year, it's not too late to just, you know, so I think that was always like something that they had in mind,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIt also didn't help that questions about college kept coming up when she was in her early 20s, before her acting career had fully taken off.\n\n\"Like, oh my god, I have to say I didn't. And at that point, you know, like 21, 22, I didn't really have much to show for it yet,\" Kendrick said.\n\nKendrick isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has spoken about not going to college.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe told E! News in 2013 that he skipped college because he \"already knew\" what he wanted to do.\n\n\"I think a large part of why people go to college is to figure out what they want to do,\" he said. \"I very much knew what I wanted to do, so I kind of just figured I'd keep carrying on trying to do that.\"\n\nIn 2024, Julia Roberts told British Vogue that she regrets not going to university.\n\n\"It wasn't in my cards,\" Roberts said, adding that her family didn't have the money and she \"had no scholarship potential.\"",

    "fullText": "A major winter storm blanketed the US this weekend with heavy snow and ice, threatening nearly 180 million Americans from the Southwest to New England.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said there were widespread travel disruptions due to the storm. Over 10,000 flights were canceled over the weekend, the most since the pandemic, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Nearly 2,000 are already canceled on Monday morning, and authorities are urging many Americans to skip the morning commute.\n\nTake a look at the impact of the potentially historic storm below.\n\nSnow turned to ice in many affected states as the storm moved from the Southwest to the Northeast.\n\nThe Departments of Transportation in several states, including New York and Texas, have urged residents to avoid roadways during the winter storm and through Monday.\n\nSome Americans ventured into the frosty weather with skis, including folks in Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.\n\nAviation analytics company Cirium said over 10,000 flights were canceled over the weekend. Nearly 2,000 flights have been canceled so far on Monday. Over 50% of American Airlines flights were canceled on Sunday and over 75% of JetBlue flights.\n\nIce and sleet are other factors at play during the winter storm. On Sunday, the National Service Prediction Center said parts of the country have received over 0.5 inches of ice.\n\nIce storm warnings remained in effect for much of the storm's path.\n\nThe power was out for nearly a million Americans by Sunday night, according to poweroutage.us, an analytics firm tracking electricity outages across the United States.\n\nTexas and other states were seeing the most outages as of Sunday evening.\n\nSalt is spread on roadways to improve traction and make plowing easier.\n\nIn Louisville, city workers used a mixture of salt and calcium chloride.\n\n\"Calcium chloride helps salt remain effective in extremely cold temperatures,\" the city said on its website.\n\nWhile many Americans stayed inside, swaths of workers across the country braved the weather to help clear snow and perform other storm-related tasks.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani praised city workers in an X post on Sunday, writing, \"Thank you to all of the city workers who have been working around the clock this weekend to keep us safe. No job is too small, no storm is too big.\"\n\nNew York City's public schools have canceled in-person classes on Monday due to the \"extreme cold.\" Instead, students will do remote learning. Boston Public Schools and Baltimore City Public Schools issued similar announcements on their websites.",

    "fullText": "Can AI feel anything at all? Anthropic's in-house philosopher says the answer isn't settled.\n\nAmanda Askell, who works on shaping Claude's behavior, said in an episode of the \"Hard Fork\" podcast published Saturday that the debate over AI consciousness remains difficult.\n\n\"Maybe you need a nervous system to be able to feel things, but maybe you don't,\" Askell said. \"The problem of consciousness genuinely is hard,\" she added.\n\nLarge language models are trained on vast amounts of human-written text, material filled with descriptions of various emotions and inner experience. Because of that, Askell said she is \"more inclined\" to believe that models are \"feeling things.\"\n\nWhen humans get a coding problem wrong, they often express annoyance or frustration. It \"makes sense\" that models trained on those conversations may mirror that reaction, Askell explained.\n\nAskell added that scientists still don't know what gives rise to sentience or self-awareness — whether it requires biology, evolution, or something else entirely.\n\n\"Maybe it is the case that actually sufficiently large neural networks can start to kind of emulate these things,\" she said, referring to consciousness.\n\nAskell also said that models are continuously learning about themselves, and she voiced concern about how AI models are learning from the internet. Models are constantly exposed to criticism about being unhelpful or failing at tasks, she said.\n\n\"If you were a kid, this would give you kind of anxiety,\" she said.\n\n\"If I read the internet right now and I was a model, I might be like, I don't feel that loved,\" she added.\n\nTech leaders remain divided over whether AI has consciousness.\n\nMicrosoft's AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, has taken a firm stance against that idea. He said in an interview with WIRED published in September that the industry must be clear that AI is designed to serve humans, not develop its own will or desires.\n\n\"If AI has a sort of sense of itself, if it has its own motivations and its own desires and its own goals — that starts to seem like an independent being rather than something that is in service to humans,\" he said. \"That's so dangerous and so misguided that we need to take a declarative position against it right now.\"\n\nHe added that AI's increasingly convincing responses amount to \"mimicry\" rather than genuine consciousness.\n\nOthers see the issue less definitively. Google DeepMind's principal scientist, Murray Shanahan, said the industry might need to rethink the language used to describe consciousness itself.\n\n\"Maybe we need to bend or break the vocabulary of consciousness to fit these new systems,\" Shanahan said in an episode of the Google DeepMind podcast published in April.",

The couple owns a home valued at up to $850,000 and owes about $480,000 on the mortgage.\n\n\"We've always maintained debt,\" Jessica said.

One vehicle carries a monthly payment of about $700, while the other is around $600.\n\n\"You make too much money to be this broke,\" Ramsey said, pointing to the gap between earnings and results.\n\nJessica also mentioned plans to move to Utah, though not for another four to five years.

That plan would require cutting discretionary spending and selling nonessential items, including the trailer, but keeping the house.\n\n\"This process of 14 months of sacrifice, y'all are never going to be the same,\" Ramsey said, adding that selling the house would not change behavior.",

    "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China.  Carney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.",
    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China. He was responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America’s northern neighbor went ahead with a trade deal with Beijing.\n\nCarney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.\n\nTrump claims otherwise, posting that “China is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen. I only hope they leave Ice Hockey alone! President DJT”\n\nThe prime minister said under the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico there are commitments not to pursue free trade agreements with nonmarket economies without prior notification.\n\n“We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy,” Carney said. “What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that developed in the last couple of years.”\n\nIn 2024, Canada mirrored the United States by putting a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from Beijing and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. China had responded by imposing 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.\n\nBreaking with the United States this month during a visit to China, Carney cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on those Canadian products.\n\nCarney has said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports coming into Canada at a tariff rate of 6.1%, growing to about 70,000 over five years. He noted there was no cap before 2024. He also has said the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.\n\nTrump posted a video Sunday in which the chief executive of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association warns there will be no Canadian auto industry without U.S. access, while noting the Canadian market alone is too small to justify large scale manufacturing from China.\n\n“A MUST WATCH. Canada is systematically destroying itself. The China deal is a disaster for them. Will go down as one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history. All their businesses are moving to the USA. I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE! President DJT,\" Trump posted on social media.\n\nTrump's post on Saturday said that if Carney “thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”\n\n“We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\n“We have a (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), but based off -- based on that, which is going to be renegotiated this summer, and I’m not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos.”\n\nTrump’s threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president’s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance.\n\nCarney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. under Trump. Speaking in Davos before Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu” and he warned about coercion by great powers — without mentioning Trump’s name. The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the World Economic Forum.\n\nTrump’s push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed into the United States as a 51st state. He posted an altered image on social media this week showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.",

    "description": "Unfortunately, my experience is all too common. If you find yourself in a situation like I did, here's what you should do.",
    "fullText": "The author at a baptism in September 2017. \"I'm happy and healthy here,\" he writes.\n\nMy day had started early that Friday. My wife, Joanne, and I arrived at 7 a.m. for my 10-year follow up colonoscopy with Dr. Smith. Although I had referred a number of my patients to his group, I hadn’t worked much with him or even met him. As the nurse was going through her checklist of tasks, she casually mentioned that he was retiring that day and a party was scheduled that evening.\n\nI was taken into the procedure room on time and 30 minutes later I woke up in the recovery room.\n\n“Dr. Mieczkowski, everything went well,” Dr. Smith told me. “I removed one large polyp and a few smaller ones, but none of them concern me. My office will let you know the results in a few days.”\n\nI thanked him and offered best wishes on his retirement, thinking that I would never see him again. I was relieved ― no signs of cancer.\n\nJoanne and I went home to eat lunch. Since I felt well, we drove to the office to do some paperwork. Around 2:45 p.m., I had an urgent need to use the bathroom and passed streaks of blood. I knew this was common after a colonoscopy, so I didn’t tell Joanne or call the doctor’s office. Fifteen minutes later, I felt more urgency and made another hurried trip to the bathroom.  There was more blood ― a lot more blood.\n\n“Oh shit! Damn it,” I said out loud.\n\nI told Joanne what was going on, and she asked, “Do you want me to call the EMTs? Are you feeling faint?” We decided to drive ourselves to a hospital only a few miles away. I called the physician’s office with an update while we were on our way.\n\nUpon arrival, I was relieved to see that the waiting room was empty. I checked in at the desk and a few minutes later, a nurse opened the door. “Dr. Mieczkowski? Come on back,” she told me.\n\nI made it. I’m going to be all right, I thought. I took a deep breath of relief as Joanne and I walked through the door and were led to my room. The nurse did the usual check-in tasks, connected me to the monitor tracking my heart rate and blood pressure, put an IV in my arm, and drew blood for testing.\n\n“No running fluids?” I questioned. “That’ll be up to the doctor after he sees you,” she replied. As she finished, I felt an urgent need to move my bowels and requested a bedside commode. I quickly passed several pints of blood, which nearly filled the container. I had just lost nearly 20% of my blood volume. I was  stunned and knew that I was in trouble.\n\n“So, you’re Dr. Mieczkowski,” Dr. Woods, the ER doctor, said sarcastically as he walked in. Great! Here we go, I thought. “Yup, that’s me,” I replied, trying to reduce the tension. I pointed out the blood in the commode, but Dr. Woods didn’t seem impressed.\n\nWhile taking my medical history and doing a brief exam, he was constantly looking up at the monitor, which showed a heart rate of 62 and a normal blood pressure. (Typically, a person’s heart rate goes up to compensate for blood loss.) He commented on the low heart rate as an indication that I was stable. I was puzzled. “Dr. Woods, I’m on a high dose of a beta blocker for my blood pressure,” I told him. “My heart rate is always around 50 and never gets above 80.” It didn’t alter his thinking. I asked whether he was going to start running IV fluids and order blood transfusions. “You look pretty stable,” he answered. “I think we can hold off for now until the labs come back. We’ll see how it goes.”\n\nI was dumbfounded. I had 40 years of experience. If I saw that amount of blood loss in a 62-year-old male with heart disease on aspirin ― a potent blood thinner ― I would have called for an immediate GI (gastrointestinal) consult, started IV fluids, and ordered blood to be ready for transfusion. Unfortunately, he jumped to a conclusion that my bleeding couldn’t be serious since my heart rate was low.  He was running the show and damned if he was going to listen to me.\n\nI continued to pass a large amount of blood every 20-30 minutes. Since the blood-filled commode had not been emptied, I used the bathroom across the hall. I was not thinking clearly at this point and failed to note the blood loss was not being measured. I always ordered nurses to monitor a patient’s blood loss and urine output. I became weaker and paler with each episode, and I began to worry that I was going to bleed out. I held back on sharing my fears with Joanne.\n\nThe author on \"a bad day at home in June 2018,\" he writes. \"This was seven months after hemorrhage. I was still trying to work and find an attorney to sue the doctors for malpractice.\"\n\nMy condition deteriorated as the hours passed in the ER. The lab results documented the drop in my blood volume. My anxiety level grew ― another sign of worsening shock. I buzzed the nurse’s station and asked to have Dr. Woods come back. When he arrived, I went through my list of concerns. I asked again about getting blood and platelet transfusions.\n\n“Where’s the GI consult for a repeat colonoscopy?” I asked. Dr. Woods had had enough of my questions. He interrupted me and said, “You know, Dr. Mieczkowski, you may have more grey hair in your beard than me, but this isn’t my first rodeo.” My wife and I looked at each other stunned! He went on, “I think you’re overreacting, and I’m sure you’re anxious. Why don’t I give you some lorazepam to calm you down.” I was in the hands of a doctor I didn’t know or trust, and he refused to listen to my concerns.\n\nIt was around 5:30 p.m. at this point. Then, to my surprise, Dr. Smith entered my room. He asked a few questions, peeked into the bedside commode, listened to my heart and abdomen and poked around a bit. I reiterated my worries and asked directly, “Are you going to do a repeat colonoscopy now?” He paused for a long while before finally answering, “Why don’t we wait this out and do a repeat colonoscopy tomorrow morning if you’re still bleeding. I’ll admit you to the hospitalist service.”\n\nI knew from my own experiences that physicians always have to weigh the pros and cons of doing another procedure versus close observation. He had to know that a GI bleed is more serious in an older patient with heart disease on a blood thinner. What was I supposed to do now? We obviously disagreed about the next steps, but I couldn’t plead my case any further. He was delaying a potentially lifesaving procedure ― one of the major causes of serious adverse events. I couldn’t help but think that the evening retirement party influenced his decision.\n\nAround 7 p.m., one of the hospitalists on duty visited me. He was thorough and, unlike Dr. Woods, he was respectful of my experience. He gave orders for blood and platelet transfusions, started IV fluids and admitted me to a medical unit upstairs. Since he was ending his shift, he assured me the night shift hospitalist would check in on me. Joanne and I were anxious to get out of the emergency room and off the hands of Dr. Woods. I was relieved.\n\nUnfortunately, my bleeding continued in my new room. I noted that my nurse placed a basin in the toilet to measure my blood loss.  When she saw the volume, she was startled and asked if I had been experiencing that level of blood loss all day. “Yes, and they never measured the blood loss,” Joanne told her.\n\nThe hours passed, and I lost track of time. I kept asking, “Where’s the blood?”  The nurse kept replying, “It’s been ordered. We’re still waiting.” I was getting colder and less aware of my surroundings. I drifted in and out of sleep but felt my wife’s hand on me constantly. I knew she was scared. I was bleeding out, albeit more slowly than a person with a gunshot wound in their abdomen.\n\nIt was around 11:30 p.m. when a sense of calm started to come over me ― it was an acceptance that I might die peacefully in bed. So this is what it feels like to die, I thought. I was no longer afraid. “I’m going to die,” I said in a whisper. I can’t imagine how Joanne felt. My nurse got startled briefly, but she was experienced with critically ill patients and called in her team.\n\nWithin seconds more nurses arrived, and they took control since the hospitalist was nowhere to be found. Two additional IV catheters were placed for rapid infusion of fluids and blood in order to keep me alive. My nurse phoned Dr. James, the on-call GI specialist and one of my friends. She gave him an update and then handed me the phone. “Larry, we need to do the colonoscopy now,” he told me. “I’ll be there within the hour.”\n\nThe author, his wife Joanne and their mini-bernedoodle, Cookie, in July 2020.\n\nThe blood and platelets were delivered soon after, and within minutes it seemed the internal bleeding was slowing since the cramping and urgency had lessened. At 1:30 a.m., the nurses wheeled me down to the endoscopy suite. Dr. James arrived, and I was asleep within seconds of getting the anesthetic. He used four titanium clips to clamp an artery bleeding from the site of where the large polyp had been removed. Lab testing confirmed that I had lost nearly 50% of my blood volume.\n\nI was discharged later that Saturday morning. Unfortunately, the shock and blood loss had damaged my heart, kidneys, and affected my thinking and memory. My condition worsened and after undergoing tests locally and at the Mayo Clinic, I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, stage III kidney failure and chronic anemia. Despite adjustment in medicines, I still couldn’t handle the rigorous requirements of practicing medicine and my daily life, and I was advised by my PCP to stop working and pursue disability.\n\nIt was very difficult to accept this recommendation, and I was very angry. I loved my work. I had just moved into a newly remodeled office and, because I was so ill, I didn’t have six months to negotiate the sale of my practice ― I had to close my business. I tried to get a malpractice lawyer to represent me but after six rejections I was finished. Fortunately, I had good disability insurance.\n\nWhy do physicians miss a diagnosis or screw up on treatment plans? What’s more, why do too many of them not listen to their patients ― the most basic thing that should be a fundamental part of their practice?\n\nDr. Woods didn’t really want to consider my concerns, but he and Dr. Smith also failed to put all the pieces of the puzzle together, whether it was because of ego, putting too much importance on my low heart rate, or being distracted by a retirement party. They both had plenty of time for my evaluation and should have thoughtfully weighed my worries.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience is common since adverse events occur in a reported 25% of hospital admissions. If you find yourself in one of these adverse events like I did, here is some advice that may be useful:\n\n1. Resist yelling at the nurse or physician. It doesn’t help, and you may get labeled as “a difficult patient,” which could make matters worse.\n\n2. If you are not being heard, get the unit’s charge nurse or manager involved early in the conflict since any delay may be a life-or-death issue. Because patients are randomly assigned to a hospital-based physician, these nurses can arrange a transfer to another physician’s care or get other specialists involved.\n\n3. If you’re very ill and at a small community hospital, you should consider pushing for a transfer to a larger hospital and, if necessary, contact the hospital’s quality, risk management, or medical director’s office. This almost always guarantees action since no hospital wants to be sued.\n\n4. Outpatient medical practice is very different from hospital-based care. The former is now volume driven and also rife with missed diagnoses, delays in treatment and unsatisfactory office visits. Nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA) have similar outcomes as physicians, often have more time to spend with their patients and have high satisfaction ratings. However, ask to schedule a visit with the physician if you’re dissatisfied with the care of the NP or PA.\n\n5. Improving communication with your provider may be aided by bringing another person with you to your appointment and having them serve as an advocate.\n\nThe author at home in July 2021.\n\n6. Since computers are now standard in most exam rooms, a provider may only spend 8-10 minutes face to face with you during a 20-minute appointment.  Prepare for your visit by reading about your problem. For example, the Cleveland Clinic’s website has a great graphic depicting which organs may be causing abdominal pain. Type a list of your concerns but keep it focused, as, unfortunately, most physicians don’t have time to thoroughly address a long list of issues. Review your list with the medical assistant and ask them to scan it into your records.\n\n7. Primary care providers may not consider a diagnosis they don’t often see.  Requesting an ultrasound if the pain is severe or not improving may save your life. If the provider says that you don’t need it, you can get a self-funded ultrasound for less than $200 in many states. Take your concerns to the office manager or a director overseeing the practice.\n\n8. Unfortunately, I don’t see a return to the times when doctors spent 30 minutes with a patient. Paying PCPs more for their time would quickly change the system, but it’s not going to happen. Medicine has morphed into big business with trillions of dollars spent each year. Finding a great provider may be a challenge but there are well-trained doctors, NPs and PAs out there who will listen to you. Word of mouth referrals are often the best. Reviews of physicians on hospital websites are not helpful in my experience, so check out independent sites when possible.\n\n9. View your first couple of visits with a new practice as an interview and move on if it’s not a fit. Remember, you can always end a long-standing relationship with a practice. If you decide to divorce your provider, send a certified letter to the administrator of the practice explaining why you are leaving.\n\nWe physicians know the healthcare system is broken. Hospital executives are overpaid. Since PCPs are paid on average $180,000 versus the $500,000 an orthopedic surgeon makes, the best and brightest medical students often pursue highly paid specialty positions. Physicians are overbooked, overwhelmed, tired and burned out. Computerized medical records have made it worse. The end result is often poor patient outcomes. Since you can’t change the system, you have to learn how to navigate through its waves using some of the suggestions that I have made.\n\nAfter my experience, I was certain that I wouldn’t survive a year but it’s now been over five years. My kidney function and anemia have improved. I am still dealing daily with my heart failure, restricting salt, resting for hours at a time and reducing my activities. I was able to resume golfing. Through my physicians’ support and the love and tender care of my wife and others, I have accepted what happened to me. It’s not what I had envisioned a decade ago, but I have a good quality of life. In the end, I survived, but I came too close to death that should have been easily prevented.\n\nNote: Names and some identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in this essay.\n\nThis piece was originally published in April 2023 and is running again now as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.\n\nAlso in Goodful: What Happened To This Woman's Head During Menopause Is Something You Have Got To See To Believe\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"We Reported Her\": Patients Are Sharing The Most Unprofessional Things Doctors Have Said To Them, And It's Horrifying\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Knew Instantly That He Would Be Dead Soon\": Doctors Are Sharing The Biggest Health Issues Patients Ignored Until It Was Too Late, And Whew, I've Been Warned",

    "description": "Andy Beshear had a laugh at Ted Cruz's expense over a fake tweet accusing the governor of being out of town during the massive winter storm.",
    "fullText": "(Francis Chung/POLITICO via AP Images)\n\nGov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) had a laugh at Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-TX) expense over a fake X post accusing the governor of being out of town during the massive winter storm that brought dangerous amounts of snow and ice to many parts of the U.S.\n\nCruz posted a “thinking” emoji along with a retweet of a post by the Kentucky Freedom Coalition showing Beshear and his wife posing in front of a church in Europe.\n\nThe account, that’s also followed by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) posted, “The liberal media went wild when Ted Cruz wasn’t in Texas for the major freeze a few years back. Well, Kentucky is in a declared emergency and @AndyBeshearKYis touring Europe. The media won’t say a word though.”\n\n— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 25, 2026\n\nBeshear responded, “Sorry for missing this earlier, @tedcruz. Been busy leading my state’s emergency response all day. From Kentucky.”\n\nSorry for missing this earlier, @tedcruz. Been busy leading my state's emergency response all day. From Kentucky. https://t.co/v71K8NvjkS\n\n— Andy Beshear (@AndyBeshearKY) January 25, 2026\n\nWashington Post reporter Aaron Blake added some additional context, writing, “This photo of Beshear in Europe is a full week old. He gave a briefing in Kentucky today.”\n\nAccording to WKYT, Beshear spent last week in Europe “with a delegation from Team Kentucky, attending the World Economic Forum and meeting with company leaders in Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland.”\n\nCruz famously received massive backlash in 2021 after escaping to sunny Cancun as a brutal winter storm left millions of his constituents “stranded in sub-freezing temperatures without electricity and water,” according to The Hill.\n\nThe contrite senator returned to Texas within 24-hours of being spotted on his travels. Cruz eventually apologized, saying, “It was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it.”\n\nThis week, as Texas braced once again for an onslaught of weather, a Texas political strategist posted, “Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front.”\n\nOf the California trip, a Cruz spokesperson told KXAN that the work trip “was scheduled weeks in advance.”\n\nThe spokesperson continued, “He will be back in Texas before the storm is projected to hit.”\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was spotted earlier today, January 20, 2026, on a plane heading to Laguna Beach as the state of Texas braces for a rare ice threat and arctic cold front. pic.twitter.com/lVTcqP8LR4\n\n— Shea Jordan Smith (@shea_jordan) January 21, 2026\n\nCruz posted that he did, in fact, return to Texas the day before the storm hit.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Cruz has been called out for retweeting a fake post. In 2023, Cruz shared an image of what looked like a shark swimming on a flooded highway in Los Angeles.\n\nThe post Kentucky Gov Clowns Ted Cruz for Getting Duped By European Pic: ‘Sorry For Missing This… Been Busy Leading My State’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "As kids, there was always that one place we begged our parents to take us to, or got excited about visiting for a birthday party or a school field trip.\n\nAfter all, kids' fixations are simple: Give them pizza and entertainment, and they'll happily stay occupied for hours. When a business offers both, it often becomes a welcome break for parents as well.\n\nEveryone has their own version of that place, whether it's Chuck E. Cheese, Dave & Buster's, or Main Event. Over the years, these spots have become go-to destinations for families across the country. In Texas, however, one chain has long stood apart as a source of Lone Star pride.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza began in 1964 as a small restaurant called \"The Pizza Place\" in Stephenville, Texas. Five years later, it relocated to Austin and was renamed Mr Gatti's, in honor of the founder's wife's maiden name.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Mr Gatti's brand expanded into a chain and introduced buffet-style dining, an innovation that helped distinguish it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the Austin restaurant predated the first Chuck E. Cheese location (which opened in San Jose, California, in 1977), Mr Gatti's didn't really jump onto the entertainment-plus-pizza trend until the 1980s. The concept quickly won over families, and today Mr Gatti's Pizza operates more than 200 locations across Texas and the southeastern U.S.\n\nIndustry experts say this hybrid model has become increasingly valuable as traditional casual dining struggles to compete for consumers. According to a 2025 McKinsey & Company survey, 45% of surveyed consumers have reduced their spending at pizza restaurants.\n\n\"When there's good entertainment and good experiences, check averages go up,\" Downtown Restaurant Investments President and BYOD CEO Dave Dittenber told Restaurant Dive.\n\nDittenber added that entertainment only works when paired with strong service and quality food.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza has sold a majority stake in its business to OneRyan Global LLC, the family office of businessman and philanthropist G. Brint Ryan, according to a press release. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nOneRyan has been a franchisee of Mr Gatti's Pizza since 2022, but its involvement with the brand has steadily expanded.\n\nIn September 2025, OneRyan acquired a minority stake in the company and, a month later, purchased a corporate-owned restaurant at South Park Meadows in Austin. That transaction completed Mr Gatti's Pizza's transition to a fully franchised system and concluded the re-franchising of all company-owned locations.",

Human Rights Council in Geneva, voicing concerns for detainees.\n\nThe council passed a motion extending a previous inquiry set up in 2022 so U.N. investigators could also document the ⁠latest unrest \"for potential future legal ‌proceedings\".\n\nRights groups say bystanders were among those killed during the biggest crackdown since Shi'ite Muslim clerics took power in the 1979 revolution. Tehran has blamed \"terrorists ‍and rioters\" backed by exiled opponents and foreign foes the U.S. and Israel.\n\nIran's mission decried the rights council's \"politicised\" resolution and rejected external interference, saying in a statement it had its own independent and robust accountability ​mechanisms to investigate \"the root causes of recent events\".\n\nTwenty-five states including France, Mexico and South Korea ‌voted in favour, while seven including China and India voted against and 14 abstained.\n\n\"This is the worst mass murder in the contemporary history of Iran,\" Payam Akhavan, a former U.N. prosecutor of Iranian-Canadian nationality, told the meeting. He called for a \"Nuremberg moment\", referring to the international criminal trials of Nazi leaders following World War Two.\n\nIran's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Ali Bahreini, told ⁠the Council its emergency session was invalid and gave ​Tehran's tally of some 3,000 people killed in the ​unrest.\n\nOne Iranian official, however, has told Reuters that at least 5,000 people, including 500 members of the security forces, had been killed.\n\nThe U.S.-based HRANA rights group ‍said it has so ⁠far verified 4,519 unrest-linked deaths and had 9,049 additional deaths under review.\n\nChina, Pakistan, Cuba and Ethiopia also questioned the utility of the rights session, with Beijing's ambassador Jia Guide ⁠calling the unrest in Iran \"a matter of internal affairs\".\n\nIt was unclear who would cover the costs of the extended ‌U.N. inquiry amid a funding crisis that has stalled other probes.",

Symptoms of Salmonella infection include watery diarrhea (that might have blood or mucus), stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite, per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nSymptoms typically begin six hours to six days after infection and usually last between four and seven days.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nIn rare cases, a Salmonella infection \"can spread to urine, blood, bones, joints, the brain or other internal organs, causing symptoms related to that body part or system,\" the CDC said.\n\nSpring & Mulberry said that there have been no confirmed illnesses or adverse health effects reported. The Raleigh, N.C.-based company was first alerted to the potential for contamination after a contract manufacturer was conducting routine third-party testing and revealed that finished product tested positive for Salmonella.\n\nCustomers who have purchased the affected lots are advised to immediately throw out the chocolate and not consume it.

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nDave Ramsey has never been shy about what really grinds his gears when it comes to the financial habits of young Americans.\n\nIn a 2024 interview with Fox News, Ramsey — a boomer — shared his true feelings about millennials and Gen-Z’s financial habits: ”They are awful. They live in their mother’s basement. They can’t figure out why they can’t buy a house because they don’t work. (1)”\n\nWhile this sentiment may ring true for people of any generation, younger Americans certainly have some odds stacked against them amidst high home prices and interest rates.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nA Consumer Affairs report found that Gen Z’s money had 86% less purchasing power than baby boomers did when they were in their twenties (2).\n\nRamsey isn’t frustrated with all Millennials and Gen Z in this age. But he says today’s tough economy — and young Americans’ spending habits — are what’s really holding them back.\n\n“We have record credit card debt,” Ramsey said on his show last month (3).\n\nThe numbers add up. Total household debt hit $18.59 trillion in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Credit card balances, on the other hand, rose by $24 billion from the previous quarter to $1.23 trillion (4).\n\n“They've been brainwashed to believe by the big banks that if I use a credit card, I can prosper with the points and the airline miles, which is mathematically ludicrous,” Ramsey added further.\n\nCreating a budget and overall financial plan can be the exact spark you need to ignite to improve your financial situation. In a video with his daughter, Rachel Cruze, on her YouTube channel, Ramsey shared that getting on a budget is one of the best things you can do with your money in 2024.\n\nA quick daily check-in of your accounts can show you exactly where your money is going.\n\nAn app like Rocket Money can easily flag recurring subscriptions, upcoming bills and unusual charges by pulling in transactions from all your linked accounts.\n\nThis can help you cut unnecessary costs, and then you can manually redirect savings straight into your retirement fund. No spreadsheets, no guesswork, no stress. Small habits like this can make a big difference over time.",

The requirement was reaffirmed when Verizon acquired TracFone in 2021.\n\nIn its request, Verizon argued that the phone unlocking rule has contributed to “device fraud” and has made phones less affordable for low-income customers.\n\nDespite Verizon facing pushback from consumers and advocacy groups who flagged the move as “anti-consumer behavior,” the FCC approved the phone carrier’s request, citing that Verizon saw a 55% increase in fraud after its 2021 purchase of TracFone required it to adhere to a 60-day lock policy.\n\nThe FCC said Verizon’s stolen handsets have even been resold on the dark web at premium prices, “particularly in countries like Russia, China, and Cuba,” according to a press release.\n\n“By waiving a regulation that incentivized bad actors to target one particular carrier’s handsets for theft, we now have a uniform industry standard that can help stem the flow of handsets into the black market,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr in the press release.\n\nShortly after Verizon received the green light from the FCC to set its own phone unlocking rules, just as its competitors do, the phone carrier informed customers of the updated policy.\n\nDevices purchased on or after Jan. 20 from Verizon’s prepaid brands, including Total Wireless, Visible, StraightTalk, and Tracfone, will be unlocked only upon request after 365 days (previously 60 days), and only if several conditions are met, according to a recent report from Droid Life.\n\nThis includes the requirement that the phone has reached 365 days of paid and active service. It is important to note that stopping payments will pause progress toward that 365-day requirement.\n\nCustomers must have an active plan on that device. And if the device was reported stolen or lost, or if there are signs of fraud, it will not be eligible for unlocking.\n\nIn addition, the smartphone’s usage must comply with the company’s Terms of Service.\n\nSo far, the device unlock policy for postpaid phones has not changed, meaning that for now, those devices will continue to unlock after 60 days.\n\nThe updated policy from Verizon has sparked backlash from consumers, who took to social media platform Reddit to express frustration with the change.\n\n“Really is a shame that one of the few affordable ways for low-income folks to get a decent unlocked cell phone was closed,” wrote one Reddit user.\n\n“Just disgusting The entire 60-day unlocking period was designed to add fairness in order to improve their already ridiculous merger with TracFone which never should have been approved in the first place. And now you have the most anti-consumer FCC ever and they get this ridiculous waivrr. It's just so depressing. That was the last decent unlocking policy in the entire United States,” wrote another.\n\n“Well what SUCKS is if you were to buy a phone on installments, pay it off, and not be able to have it unlocked for a year,” wrote another user.\n\nVerizon’s move to extend its device unlocking policy from 60 days to 365 days for its prepaid brands comes as more consumers across the country contemplate switching phone carriers. Customers have grappled with higher monthly bills, according to a survey from Market Force Information last year.\n\nApproximately 65% of consumers use phone services from the \"Big 3\" carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T, spending more than $100 per month on their wireless services.\n\nOn average, Verizon customers pay more than $150 for service.\n\nAbout 23% of Verizon customers are considering switching to another carrier in the next year or two, citing better pricing, promotions, and coverage as the primary reasons.\n\nVerizon scored 40% in overall brand performance across customer experience metrics.\n\nSmaller wireless carriers such as Consumer Cellular and Mint Mobile scored 73% and 65.8%, respectively.\n\n\"There's a clear shift in the market towards smaller, more agile wireless carriers who are delivering superior customer experiences,\" said David Murray, senior director of client strategy at Market Force Information, in a press release.\n\n\"While cost and coverage are always key factors, today's consumers are placing more importance on ease of service and overall satisfaction with their provider,” he continued.\n\nAmid this growing trend, Verizon lost 7,000 postpaid phone customers during the third quarter of 2025, according to the company’s most recent earnings report.\n\nThe loss comes after Verizon rolled out price hikes earlier in the year, a move the company’s new CEO said was one of the top reasons why customers left.\n\nT-Mobile announces free offer for Verizon and AT&T customers\n\n​​Verizon CEO sounds alarm on why customers are leaving in droves\n\nSpectrum raises red flag on cause of fleeing customer problem\n\n“For the past few years, our financial growth has relied too heavily on price increases, a strategic approach that relies too much on price without subscriber growth is not a sustainable strategy,” said Verizon CEO Dan Schulman during an earnings call in October. “Every year, it gets harder to grow as we lap past price increases and experience higher churn. This cannot continue, and there is no question that meaningful change is needed.”\n\nHe also vowed to transform the company by removing customer pain points and increasing value. Schulman also stated that Verizon’s transformation will not be “about promotional activities that can be quickly imitated.”\n\n“It is about true innovation, not easily replicated by our competitors,” he said.\n\nIt is vital for Verizon to double down on customer retention, especially after the company suffered a major service outage last week that lasted about 10 hours, affecting roughly 1.5 million customers across multiple states.\n\nAlso, a recent J.D. Power survey found the company lags T-Mobile in consumer satisfaction for postpaid and prepaid plans.\n\nThe average consumer satisfaction score for postpaid plans under traditional carriers is 593 (on a 1,000-point scale). For prepaid plans, the average score is 601.\n\nSpecifically, T-Mobile ranks the highest in postpaid and prepaid, with satisfaction scores of 636 and 617, respectively.\n\nVerizon takes second place in both segments, with a 583 score for postpaid plans and 595 for prepaid plans.\n\nAT&T falls behind Verizon with a satisfaction score of 573 for postpaid and 597 for prepaid.\n\n“The findings show that value is the most important driver of the overall experience, followed closely by service quality,” said Carl Lepper, senior director of technology, media and telecom at J.D. Power, in a press release.\n\n“These two dimensions are central to our new model — and for good reason,” he added. “As the market expands with a wide variety of brands designed to meet diverse customer needs, expectations are rising — not just for strong network performance, but also for service plans that reflect individual preferences.”",

    "fullText": "Many school districts across Central Texas have decided to cancel classes amid a winter storm lingering on Monday, January 26. However, a few in the San Antonio area have decided to stay open, leaving parents mixed with support and disapproval.\n\nSome parents are upset with the Poteet Independent School District for keeping its schools open during the Texas winter storm. The district posted its decision on Sunday, January 25, writing that school will resume as normal on Monday. Buses will run at a regular time, according to its Facebook post.\n\nIn the comments, Gloria Fontenot wrote that it's too cold out for her children to go to school. She added that her kids tell her that their buses typically don't have heat on. Teresa Salazar also added that her daughter won't be going to school, as she claims it's always cold in her classroom regardless of the temperature outside. Dale Woods said the decision is \"very sad.\"\n\n\"Be ready for the absences unfortunately,\" Angelica Alderete stated.\n\n\"Yall won't give them off to keep them safe but yall will give them off for a fun weekend of the strawberry festival!!!! Smh,\" Chrussy Perez wrote.\n\nWhile the majority of the comments disagreed with the district, some parents agreed with Poteet ISD. Desiré Guerra thanked the district for the updated and stressed how others need to be mindful that the school may be the only warm place, warm meal that another child may need.\n\n\"Need to send my kids to poteet. No reason to cancel school. Good for you Poteet ISD,\" Anthony Kassin wrote.\n\n\"I'm glad that there is one school that schedule must go on, I'm sure if the weather does get bad they will have an early release but don't look like it, Good job Poteet ISD,\" Zina Gomez added.\n\nCharles Camarillo, the superintendent of Poteet ISD, told MySA the decision to keep the schools open came after having conversations and collaboration with other county districts and knowing that very little to no precipitation is expected.\n\n\"Cold by itself is no reason to close. Second, every parent has the choice to keep their kids at home and can do so without repercussions,\" Camarillo stated via email. \"What about the parents who need them in school or cannot provide care while they are at work. You would think having choices is better than not, and leave the complaining for a better reason.\"\n\nPoteet ISD isn't alone in resuming classes on Monday. Jourdanton ISD and Pleasanton ISD are keeping their schools open on Monday.\n\nThe cities are in Atascosa County, which is under an Extreme Cold Warning until noon on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The region is expected to have temperatures below 22 degrees around 8 to 9 a.m. on Monday. Temperatures will inch up in the mid-30s around 3 p.m. and then drop again to below freezing by the evening. The NWS says there is refreeze potential on Sunday night, where any liquid or slush remains.\n\nThis article originally published at San Antonio-area school staying open Monday sparks backlash from parents.",

With kickoff set for less than six days, TCU sixth-year senior linebacker Namdi Obiazor has recently accepted an invitation to participate in the annual showcase game. Obiazor, who played in 53 games over four seasons, will join linebacker Kaleb Elarms-Orr, safety Bud Clark and tight end DJ Rogers in the Senior Bowl.\n\nOfficially Accepted!\n\nLB Namdi Obiazor (@namdi4k) from @TCUFootball is headed to the 2026 Panini Senior Bowl 🔥#TheDraftStartsInMobile #WherePlayersPlay pic.twitter.com/wNc4jFWWca\n\n— Panini Senior Bowl (@seniorbowl) January 25, 2026\n\nObiazor, who started his collegiate career at Iowa Western and was a JUCO All-American in 2021, played safety during his first season with the Horned Frogs. Obiazor played in all 15 games and made two starts, finishing with 49 tackles and two pass breakups. Following TCU’s 2022 season, which culminated in a trip to the national title game, Obiazor moved to linebacker and replaced Dee Winters. The change worked well for Obiazor, who earned an All-Big 12 Honorable Mention with 84 tackles, six tackles for loss, four sacks and two pass breakups in 2023.\n\nA three-year starter at TCU, Obiazor ranked second on the team with 81 tackles, third with 6.5 tackles for loss and fifth with 2.5 sacks during the 2024 season. Obiazor would’ve had to turn pro last offseason, but in light of the Diego Pavia lawsuit, which granted additional eligibility to players who started at the JUCO level, Obiazor returned to the Horned Frogs in 2025. In his final season at TCU, Obiazor posted a career-high 88 total tackles along with four tackles for loss, two sacks, two interceptions and a forced fumble. The 6-foot-3, 230-pounder from Eden Prairie, Minnesota was named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week against Colorado.\n\nThe 2026 Senior Bowl will kick off on Saturday. Jan. 31 at 1:30 p.m. Former TCU players who’ve participated in the game include Jack Bech (2025 – MVP), Emani Bailey (2024), Jared Wiley (2024), Brandon Coleman (2024), Steve Avila (2023), Derius Davis (2023), Max Duggan (2023), Dee Winters (2023) and Dylan Horton (2023).",

    "fullText": "Where should the blame go after Broncos drop AFC Championship Game to Patriots? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFollowing a difficult loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday, the Denver Broncos will be wondering how things went so badly. Broncos Country will be pointing fingers in multiple directions.\n\nThe Broncos got up 7-0 in this one and looked to be in control during most of the first half of the game. The biggest play of the game came in the second quarter, when Jarrett Stidham dropped back for a pass and, while facing a fierce New England pass rush, threw a pass with two hands to get rid of the ball.\n\nIt was originally ruled an incomplete pass with an intentional grounding penalty, but the officials quickly changed that, ruling it a backwards pass and recovery by New England. Two plays later, the Patriots scored a touchdown and were on the board, tying the game. In the second half, a grand total of three points were scored... by both teams.\n\nThere were multiple reasons for that, and all of them played a factor in how this game ended up.\n\nThe Broncos' head coach is going to get some heat for this loss due to his play-calling, but his decision to go for it on 4th-and-1 from the New England 14-yard line rather than kicking a field goal will be questioned for quite some time.\n\nIn addition to choosing against taking a chip-shot field goal and taking a 10-0 lead, the play call was poor. Jarrett Stidham dropped back to throw a quick pass to RJ Harvey. It didn't even come close to working. The Broncos turned the ball over on downs and gave away all of the momentum they had earned.\n\nIt turned out to be a critical sequence in this game.\n\nWhen looking back at this game, the majority of Broncos fans are going to put this loss on Stidham and say that with Bo Nix, the Broncos would have won. While that is quite possible, Stidham is not the reason the Broncos lost this game.\n\nTo be clear, he was far from good. But the weather in the second half (more on that later) made it all but impossible to do anything on offense. Stidham threw an interception on what ended up being the Broncos' final possession. That was easily the worst play he made in the game. But he had Courtland Sutton drop two passes and he got little help from his running game. It's hard to put this loss all on his shoulders.\n\nWhat would a loss in today's NFL be without some controversy? Fans of the Buffalo Bills have spent the past week having that discussion, and Broncos fans have some good ammunition to do the same following this game.\n\nThe backwards pass call was highly questionable.\n\nThe refs are at it again\n\nThis was called a backwards pass by Stidham. It’s clearly going forward\n\nThe Broncos just got screwed pic.twitter.com/8OljvmyAgM\n\n— Benchwarmer Sports (@bdubsports_) January 25, 2026\n\nThis was clearly a \"pass\" by Stidham and not a fumble. One angle of the replay shows the ball start to leave Stidham's hands and get deflected by a Patriots defender. What does that result in on any other play? An incomplete pass.\n\nSo in this situation, it truly does not matter where the ball lands in relation to where it was thrown. If it was deflected, it's incomplete. The Patriots go into halftime with no points if not for this play.\n\nOn the opening possession of the second half, the Patriots went for it on 4th-and-1 from the Denver 8-yard line. Drake Maye used a quarterback sneak up the middle and was down right near the line to gain. An overhead replay seemed to show that he came up short, leading to a challenge from Payton. Payton asked for the officials to look at that overhead replay.\n\nIt was extremely close either way, but the referees chose to stick with the call that was made on the field. The Broncos were able to hold to a field goal, but those ended up being the winning points for the Patriots.\n\nWhile many fans are going to passionately criticize Payton and Stidham for this defeat, the snow that began to fall at halftime ended up being the biggest factor in this game.\n\nAfter the initial drive by the Patriots, offensive football was almost non-existent. The footing was terrible for the players and vision was extremely obstructed due to the blizzard-like conditions. This game would have had a much different outcome without the snow and it's an unfortunate turn of events for the Broncos that the weather in their own stadium pretty much ended their hopes of going to the Super Bowl.\n\nFor anyone suggesting that the Patriots had to play in the same conditions, that's not entirely true. If you look at the conditions in the early third quarter compared to how it was just moments after that, it was a drastic change, which is exactly why the score of 10-7 ended up being the final score.\n\nIt was nearly impossible to produce any points once it got like that.\n\nREAD:4 things Denver Broncos must do in order to beat Patriots in AFC Championship Game\n\nThe Broncos had their chances and this was a difficult way to end what was a great season.\n\nBroncos get good news following recent move made by Packers\n\nJarrett Stidham can join exclusive list that includes multiple Hall of Famers\n\n4 under-the-radar factors for Broncos fans to watch for in AFC Championship Game\n\nBroncos' similarities between last Super Bowl appearance and this year are astonishing\n\nFormer coach hated by Broncos fans could play specific role in derailing Super Bowl plans",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are headed to Super Bowl LX after defeating the Denver Broncos by a 10-7 score in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday.\n\nDefense ruled the day in a low-scoring, messy game for both teams. It was tough to move the ball downfield for both offenses with the snow pouring from the sky at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium. The Patriots recorded only 206 total yards of offense, while the Broncos only mustered 181 total yards.\n\nThe rushing attack was a major factor for the Patriots on a day when throwing the ball in the elements proved difficult. They recorded 141 yards on the ground, including a six-yard rushing touchdown from Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.\n\nThe difference in the game ended up being the turnover the Patriots forced on Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham, who fumbled a backwards pass while being hit by linebacker Christian Elliss. That play put the Patriots in the red zone and set up the touchdown run by Maye.\n\nOverall, Maye went 10-of-21 passing for 86 yards, along with rushing 10 times for 65 yards and one touchdown. Rhamondre Stevenson had 25 carries for 71 yards to help punch New England's ticket to the Super Bowl.\n\nHere is how fans reacted on social media to the Patriots' win:\n\nWHAT ARE THEY GONA SAY NOW.

    "fullText": "Braves predicted to sign $200M World Series champion, 2X All-Star to form 'unfair' Chris Sale duo originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are usually known for having one of the top starting rotations in the league. However, after this upcoming season, the picture at the position becomes a major focus. Outside of two Braves starters, there are no pitchers currently under contract beyond that point.\n\n“Beyond Spencer Strider and Spencer Schwellenbach, there are no clear locks for the Atlanta Braves rotation beyond 2026,’” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote.\n\nThe Braves are content with the starters they have this season, but there comes a point when the future must be considered. Atlanta reportedly checked in on Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta before he was traded. Anthopoulos knows the team needs another starter, but it cannot be just anyone.\n\n“We’ve explored the starting rotation, adding and getting some type of starter, whether that’s trade or signing. We’d like for it to be someone impactful, someone we think can start a playoff game,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThere is still a name on the market that the Braves could pursue: Framber Valdez. FanSided’s Mark Powell believes Atlanta can get a deal done.\n\n“But Valdez is the best starting pitcher available after Ranger Suarez signed with the Boston Red Sox. His catcher cross-up could cost him some money on what's been a slow market for free-agent starting pitchers. That should only help a team like the Braves, which has an elite rotation (when healthy) but quite frankly needs more bodies. Adding Valdez to a group that already includes Chris Sale, Spencer Strider and Reynaldo Lopez is borderline unfair,” Powell wrote.\n\nThe Braves would benefit greatly from adding Valdez, as it would give the rotation two left-handers and create a nightmare matchup for opposing teams. Atlanta’s rotation is already strong, but this type of move could elevate it to an elite level.\n\nValdez is still chasing another World Series championship, and there may be no better opportunity than joining the team that once defeated the Houston Astros on the game’s biggest stage. Anthopoulos still has room to make another offseason addition as Spring Training approaches.",

Wisconsin was plagued by a 25.7% shooting clip in the second half, which enabled USC to outscore UW 34-30 in the frame en route to the two-point victory.\n\nGreg Gard's group did fare well in the first half with 41 total points, however. Fueled by Boyd, guard John Blackwell and big man Nolan Winter, UW mustered 26 of those points in the final 10 minutes of the first half while overcoming a 10-point deficit.\n\nThe Badgers opened the second frame with a 17-7 scoring burst, but USC countered with a 16-2 run to capture a 62-60 lead with under five minutes to spare. The two teams traded blows down the stretch, but with two ticks to go, Boyd missed an acrobatic layup attempt to tie the game. The Trojans would snatch the rebound and end the game from the line, claiming the two-point win.\n\nFinal at the Kohl pic.twitter.com/jF20pKPXhu\n\n— Wisconsin Basketball (@BadgerMBB) January 25, 2026\n\nWinter added 12 points, six rebounds and two blocks in 38 minutes of action, while Blackwell chipped in with 11 points, nine rebounds and two assists in 36 minutes.

    "description": "Here's what coach Shea Ralph said Vanderbilt women's basketball needs to learn the most from its loss to South Carolina.",
    "fullText": "For a team that was undefeated going into its matchup with South Carolina, just about everything went wrong for Vanderbilt women's basketball on Jan. 25 at Colonial Life Arena.\n\nOn offense, the No. 4 Commodores committed 20 turnovers. On defense, they allowed South Carolina to shoot 62% from the field (40-for-65).\n\nDuring one sequence at the beginning of the third quarter, they cut their deficit to seven, but they missed a few layups and from there, the No. 2 Gamecocks took control.\n\n\"As crappy as we played today for a lot of that game, especially in the second quarter, in the beginning of the third we were in it,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph said. \"We can never let the wind go out of our sails. We can never lay down and die. And I think for me, that was what was most disappointing and embarrassing. We just didn't play like ourselves, and at points in the game, it was like we quit.\"\n\nRalph did compliment Mikayla Blakes on her hustle, as the star sophomore put up 23 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals.\n\nThe most disappointing element to Ralph, though, was Vanderbilt's defense. Though some of the issue was the Commodores (20-1, 6-1 SEC) allowing 32 points off their 20 turnovers, the Gamecocks (20-2, 6-1) had 10 made 3's, shooting 59%.\n\n\"Our defense, was bad today, awful,\" Ralph said. \"We can score, we'll be fine. We scored 74 points. We turned the ball over 20 times, even if we turned it over 10 times and scored on the other 10 possessions, we would've scored 100 points almost. We can't just give people the ball, but we were still able to score. They didn't hold us scoreless. We just couldn't defend them. So you can't do both, you can't give them the ball and then not guard them. That is a recipe for absolute disaster.\"\n\nVanderbilt must bounce back fast before its matchup at Ole Miss on Jan. 29 (6:30 p.m. CT, SECN+). Ralph said that it's unlikely the Commodores will return to Nashville before heading to Oxford, Mississippi. Both locations were hit hard by the winter storm that has swept through nearly half the nation, bringing ice damage and power outages.\n\nUltimately, Ralph believes that playing in the hostile environment of Colonial Life Arena will be beneficial.\n\n\"This is a really tough environment to prepare for,\" she said. \"This is why I beg and plead for people to show up to our games, because we want to have a home environment like South Carolina has for our kids . . . The only way you prepare for it, I think, is by having one or continuing to have experience playing in one. A lot of my kids that played a lot of big minutes today haven't done that in this kind of environment.\n\n\" . . . I'm looking at myself even more than I'm looking at our players. How do we prepare them better? How do we help them more so that they can execute better in a game like this, when a team is firing on all cylinders at home? Absolutely, we've got to figure that out as a coaching staff. And then sometimes I know, as a player, you've just got to go through it to learn this. This was a really hard lesson to learn today. This was not fun. But I know my team, I know my staff, I know we are just fine.\"\n\nAria Gerson covers Vanderbilt athletics for The Tennessean.

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers could be seeing the return of one of their key bench players. Sam Merrill, who has missed the team’s last five games with a right-hand sprain, is listed as questionable for Monday’s game against the Orlando Magic.\n\nMerrill has been dealing with a hand sprain for much of the season. He injured it originally in a November win against the Milwaukee Bucks. This resulted in him missing just over a month of games. When he did return to the lineup, he wasn’t pain-free, as head coach Kenny Atkinson said at the time that he couldn’t even shake Merrill’s hand after games due to the pain he was in.\n\nMerrill injured his hand again in the team’s Jan. 14 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. That’s the same game in which Darius Garland injured his other toe.\n\nAnything bought from the links helps support Fear the Sword. You can also shop all of Homage’s Cavs gear HERE. The link to the new City Edition shirt can be found HERE.\n\nWe don’t have any further updates on Garland’s injury beyond what the team released last Sunday. The Cavs said that Garland would be reevaluated in seven to 10 days after suffering a Grade 1 right great toe sprain. That initial timeframe would put the reevaluation happening anytime between now and Wednesday.\n\nEven though the Cavs won’t be fully healthy for their game against the Magic, it would be beneficial to possibly get Merrill back in the lineup. Merrill has the third-best on/off differential on the team this season (+4.7 points per 100 possessions, 75th percentile). They’re 16-8 in the games he’s played.\n\nOn the season, Merrill is averaging 13.8 points on .470/.455/.882 shooting splits.\n\nThe Magic will once again be without their leading scorer, Franz Wagner (ankle), in Monday’s rematch.",

    "description": "The Cleveland Guardians had a clear reason for addressing the bullpen over the offseason.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Guardians were fairly active addressing one of the areas of their roster this offseason, even though it wasn’t the position group fans were hoping the team would spend some money on: the bullpen.\n\nChris Anonetti recently spoke about why Cleveland felt they needed to add more depth to the bullpen, and a little bit about the pitchers they brought in.\n\n\"We lost a couple of pitchers last year to some unfortunate circumstances, and then we had a couple of guys become free agents. So this was an area that we felt we wanted to try to supplement,” explained Antonetti (quote via Mason Horodyski of WEWS).\n\n“The group, by and large, did a really good job last year, but we didn't want to rest on that. We wanted to try to add some options, because we know it's an area that will be tested over the course of the season. We don't, we're going to need far more than just eight relievers to start the season with. We're gonna need to be 13, 14, 15, or more deep.”\n\nCleveland, as a group, had a reliever ERA of 3.44, which ranked third in MLB, and a WHIP of 1.23, which ranked third in the American League.\n\nHowever, as Antonetti noted, the Guardians will very likely be without Emmanuel Clase moving forward, and Jakob Junis, Nic Enright, Sam Hentges, Kolby Allard, and Zak Kent are off to their next team, leaving plenty of innings for the team to fill.\n\nThe Guardians did need to add some more arms to the reliever core, and to the front office’s credit, they do do just that by adding Shawn Armstrong, Colin Holderman, Connor Brogdon, and Rule 5 selected Payton Pallette.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly how all of these pieces fit together, but the Guardians have certainly given Stephen Vogt and the rest of the staff options to go to througohut the season.\n\nThere will definitely be a nice competition throughout spring training to see which arms start on the big-league roster, who will begin at Triple-A, and which pitchers may not have a role with the Guardians in 2026.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl after their 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game.\n\nWith the Patriots reaching the big game, Mike Vrabel not only joins an exclusive club, but also has the chance to make some more history as well. Vrabel will be the second person ever to coach and play in a Super Bowl for the same team.\n\nVrabel joins Gary Kubiak as the only coach who has reached a Super Bowl with the same team as both a coach and a player. If the Patriots win the Super Bowl, Vrabel will be the first person in history to win a Super Bowl as a coach and player for the same franchise.\n\nTom Flores, Mike Ditka, Tony Dungy and Doug Pederson are the only people to win a Super Bowl as both a player and a coach, but none did so with the same team. Vrabel won three Super Bowls as a player, and in his first year as a head coach with the Patriots, he has taken them to the Super Bowl.\n\nVrabel is the eighth coach in history to lead a team to the Super Bowl in his first year with the team. He joins Kubiak, Jim Caldwell, Jon Gruden, Bill Callahan, George Seifert, Red Miller and Don McCafferty.\n\nThe Patriots were 4-13 last season, and in Vrabel’s first season, they went 14-3, won the AFC East and clinched the No. 2 seed in the AFC. It is the Patriots’ first Super Bowl appearance since the 2018 season, when they defeated the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nVrabel is a finalist for Coach of the Year. He won Coach of the Year in 2021 with the Tennessee Titans. He went to the AFC Championship in 2019 with the Titans. As a player, he was a Pro Bowler and First-Team All-Pro.\n\nAlthough Vrabel was a linebacker, he caught 12 touchdowns in his career in the regular season and playoffs combined. He also had 66 sacks, 24 forced fumbles and 851 tackles between the regular season and playoffs in his career.\n\nPatriots’ Drake Maye Joins Elite QB Company After Beating Broncos",

    "fullText": "Vincent Kompany is still learning on his job.\n\nThe 39-year-old, now in his second season at Bayern Munich, is still in the early part of his managerial career, which began only in 2020. In that time he’s overseen highs and lows, having both taken Burnley to promotion and suffering relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“I don’t think that winning titles makes you a good coach, or getting relegated makes you a bad one,” Kompany reflected in remarks captured by @iMiaSanMia. “A good coach is someone who learns something new every year, regardless of whether we win or lose.\n\n“We’re in a good position right now; it’s all about the details. We simply want to be competitive. We want to prepare well for the matches where trophies are at stake, where it’s about going through or being eliminated. In those moments, we have to have the big players fit because they’re the ones who decide the games for us.”\n\nWhat else is there to say? You have to love Kompany’s mindset. It is no surprise, given who he is and how he approaches his work, that he has found success at Bayern. Now the club is reflecting these attitudes in just about every way: every day, a little step forward.\n\nAnd this year? The stars seem to be lining up for the Bavarians. It would be a surprise to see them not go far in the Champions League.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings play five times in the final week of fantasy hockey before a lengthy matchup that starts before the NHL's Olympic break and ends after it.",
    "fullText": "While the Olympic break obviously makes NHL scheduling a lot more difficult, it is curious that Week 17 of the fantasy hockey season ends on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nIt's a standard seven-day week, but that means Week 18 will run from Monday, Feb. 2 to Sunday, March 1, putting the Olympics right in the middle of the matchup.\n\nWould it not have made more sense for the Olympic break to be the cut-off between Weeks 17 and 18, and run Week 17 from Monday, Jan. 26 to Thursday, Feb. 5 (11 days) and then Week 18 from Wednesday, Feb. 25 to Sunday, March 8 (12 days)? Anyway, I digress.\n\n(Week 18's primer will likely be split into two parts, one for Feb. 2 to 5, and then an update for Feb. 25 to March 8).\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings are the highlight in Week 17 with a league-high five games, though they're all on the road with two back-to-backs. The matchups are not easy, and with Sunday in Carolina being their fifth game in seven days – that one seems like a scheduled loss.\n\nThere are seven teams – the Islanders, Bruins, Golden Knights, Blue Jackets, Flyers, Mammoth and Rangers – that play four times, including a back-to-back, home-and-home series between the Isles and Rangers. That's a matchup where targeting Isles would be beneficial. Bo Horvat is back in the lineup and providing a more balanced offense, and the Rangers are completely lost in net without Igor Shesterkin.\n\nIt's a very heavy Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday schedule, so plan accordingly, as there's only one game on Friday and three games on Sunday, leaving little wiggle room if you're far behind entering Saturday's games.\n\nAll positions and rostered percentages are courtesy of Yahoo Fantasy.\n\nPick players from teams at the top of the schedule matrix to maximize games and matchups. Green is good. Red is bad. Points percentages are as of Sunday morning.\n\nFantilli's fantasy value this season has oscillated from potential breakout star to occasional streamer with occasional hot streaks. Note, however, Fantilli's seen increased ice time under Rick Bowness, and he's responded accordingly with plenty of shots, hits and faceoff wins. With increased ice time, the offensive production should come. So far, Fantilli has been underwhelming, and if there's a stat that might point toward a turnaround under Bowness, it's his curiously low 9.3 shooting percentage.\n\nKent Johnson was the flavor of the week last week, but the spike in ice time was likely Bowness trying to see what Johnson can do, and the 11:15 of ice time versys Dallas and 13:12 versus Tampa is evidence Bowness wasn't impressed.\n\nNHL Power Rankings: Each Team's Biggest Trade Bait Will there be more trades before the Olympic break? The action's already heating up as we look at one player per team who could be traded in this week's NHL power rankings.\n\nCirelli has two goals and six points in his past three games, taking over L1 from the injured Brayden Point and Nick Paul dropping down to L4. Dominic James gets L2 with Jake Guentzel, but Cirelli is the safer option. The Lightning can change up their lines at any moment – their blueline is decimated once again with Erik Cernak injured – but Cirelli's the most logical player to target for L1/PP2 upside on an excellent team.\n\nAlex Lyon's 26-save shutout against the Isles gives me pause on holding Luukkonen all season because it gives the Sabres a legitimate case for all three of their goalies to see increased playing time. Remember, too, it was difficult for Luukkonen to get into a rhythm when he played so sparingly upon returning from injury.\n\nWith no back-to-backs and only three games in Week 17, it's very probable Luukkonen only sees action once, with Luukkonen, Lyon and Colten Ellis each getting a start. It's not ideal, but the difference between this season and last season is that the Sabres are legitimately good, so it's still worth holding onto Luukkonen just in case he performs the best and gets an extra start or two.\n\nIt was too quick to proclaim Montembeault's return as the No. 1. After a string of five games where he only lost once, Montembeault has allowed seven goals in his two most recent games, both of which were losses. The reprieve for Montembeault is that only three of the goals allowed were at even strength (though one was shorthanded), but it opens the door again for Jakub Dobes to get more playing time. Really tough schedule for the Habs in Week 17 with the Knights and Avalanche at home and then a road date in Buffalo.\n\nConsidering Adin Hill hasn't exactly been sharp since his return, Schmid still holds plenty of fantasy value as they continue to alternate starts. Long-term, Hill is still the play, but Schmid has generally been quite good this season – 15 wins in 22 starts but a pedestrian .896 SP – and will continue to win games, especially since the Knights are expected to load up ahead of the trade deadline, even after acquiring Rasmus Andersson.\n\nOlofsson scored three points in three games entering Sunday's game against the Leafs, and he has seen his ice time spike to over 20 minutes per game following a promotion to L1 and PP1 with Nathan MacKinnon. (He came skated about 18 minutes on Sunday against the Leafs). He's an excellent shooter but is prone to streaks and inconsistent play, but as long as he's in this role, there's some under-the-radar fantasy value. Olofsson provides good shot volume as long as he gets the ice time, with a pretty good conversion rate at a 13.2 shooting percentage, though he tends to be most effective on the power play.\n\nKasper's had a tough season, but his potential is evident, and that's one reason why the Wings have kept him in the lineup virtually all season. (He was scratched for one game in late December, with Mason Appleton returning from injury).\n\nThat patience seems to be paying off; Kasper has two goals and six points in his past five games, with his ice time spiking to 17:29 in a tough matchup in Minnesota. His production was bound to spike if you consider his unsustainably low 6.3 shooting percentage – he shot 13.1 percent last season – and it's always a good sign that a player has confidence when he elects to shoot on a 2-on-1 rush, as he did Saturday against the Jets.\n\nIt might take Chytil some time to find his rhythm – he narrowly missed an excellent opportunity to convert a goal in his first game back against the Devils on Friday – but still finished the game with 18:29 of ice time, eight faceoff wins, two shots and a hit. Injury risk is always a concern, but the Canucks desperately needed his presence down the middle, and he offers L2 and PP2 upside.\n\nChytil's 50-point upside and solid shooting volume – at least two shots per game – make him one of the more worthwhile gambles off the waiver wire at this point in the season, even at a pretty deep position.\n\nShayne Gostisbehere is battling a groin issue – again – which puts Walker on PP1. The Canes are hoping Gostisbehere returns before the Olympic break, but if he doesn't, Walker's fantasy value spikes with the new role. Walker obviously doesn't have as much offensive upside as Gostisbehere, and Alexander Nikishin and K'Andre Miller could both challenge for some PP1 minutes (they're on PP2 right now), but Walker can still provide a high floor with hits and blocks. In deeper leagues where defense is thin, Walker is a low-risk pickup with upside.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley took 6-6 center Madina Okot out of the starting lineup and went with four guards. Here's why.",
    "fullText": "COLUMBIA — Fresh off the first SEC loss of the season, South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley took Madina Okot out of the starting lineup.\n\nThe 6-6 center still scored 17 points in the 103-74 win over No. 4 Vanderbilt on Jan. 25.\n\n\"Madina is not the scapegoat at all,\" Staley said. \"It was totally giving her a look at the game. Just take a little bit of pressure off of her, because we're putting her in situations that we have had (previous) players build to those moments.\"\n\nFreshman Agot Makeer started in Okot's place for South Carolina for a four-guard lineup. Okot was 8-of-9 from the floor with seven rebounds and five steals, a game after she had six points in the loss to No. 16 Oklahoma on Jan. 22.\n\nStaley said legendary South Carolina players like A'ja Wilson and Aaliyah Boston didn't have to dominate as freshmen or in Okot's case, in their first year with the team after transferring. Okot started for Mississippi State last year but the expectations differed.\n\n\"I know she felt better that she wasn't in at the beginning of the game, she could see how they were playing, what they might do, get her mind ready to play,\" Staley said. \"Sometimes that's all some players need is a different look at it.\"\n\nWilson started in her first exhibition game as a freshman in 2014 but then didn't start in a real game until her sophomore year.\n\n\"The entire crowd anticipated (Wilson) coming in and just doing all the things that she would she would normally do if she was a starter,\" Staley said. \"We just kind of took a page out of that book to make sure Madina gives us something.\"\n\nOkot was 3-of-9 from the floor against Oklahoma, and had just four rebounds with three turnovers.\n\nOkot checked in with 5:23 left in the first quarter then got a steal less than 20 seconds later. She dribbled down the court as two Vanderbilt guards caught up with her and kicked back out to Ta'Niya Latson at the 3-point line. Latson gave Okot the ball back inside and she made the layup through contact.\n\n\"Madina played extremely well,\" Latson said. \"She went out there and she got back to herself.\"\n\nLatson's short jumper with 1:30 left in the first quarter rolled out and Okot caught the rebound, kept it high in her hands and got the putback layup plus the foul.\n\n\"I feel like it was a different presence for (Okot) out there,\" said guard Tessa Johnson. \"That's the Madina that we've been missing, and I think she really picked it up.

    "fullText": "World number one Scottie Scheffler launched his 2026 US PGA Tour campaign with a runaway victory in the American Express at La Quinta, California.\n\nScheffler, whose 2025 season included two major titles among six victories, piled up nine birdies in a six-under par 66 on the Stadium Course, where even a double-bogey at the 17th was barely a blip on the way to a 27-under par total of 261 and a four-shot victory.\n\nAustralian veteran Jason Day climbed into a share of second with a superb eight-under par 64. He was joined on 265 by Americans Ryan Gerard, Matt McCarty and Andrew Putnam, Gerard posting a seven-under 65 and McCarty and Putnam each signing for a 68.\n\nScheffler, 29, became the first player since Tiger Woods to grab his 20th US PGA Tour title before the age of 30. He's off to his fifth straight season with at least one victory.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Scheffler said. \"It was a challenging week. I did a good job of staying patient and executing when I needed to.\"\n\nScheffler, who hasn't missed a cut on the PGA Tour since August 2022, started the day one off the lead and opened with a birdie. He bogeyed the second before settling in with back-to-back birdies at four and five and another pair at seven and eight.\n\nHe added four more birdies coming in, his four-footer at the par-five 16th pushing him to 29-under.\n\nHe was in the water off the tee on the way to a double-bogey at the par-three 17th, but by then there was no catching him.\n\nOvernight leader Kim Si-woo of South Korea carded an even par 72 to tie for sixth on 22-under.\n\nTeenager Blades Brown, who started the day tied with Scheffler on 21-under, closed with a two-over 74 for a share of 18th.\n\nIt finished off a remarkable week for the 18-year-old from Tennessee, who tied for 17th in a Korn Ferry event in the Bahamas on Wednesday before a dash to California to tee it up on a sponsor's exemption.\n\nHe flirted with a 59 on Friday, when a 60 gave him a share of the halfway lead. He had a birdie chance at 18 for a share of 10th -- and a place in the Torrey Pines field.\n\nHe closed with a bogey but departed happy with his week.\n\n\"I could probably write a book about what I've learned these past couple of days,\" Brown said.\n\n\"Just knowing that I can compete out here. It was so cool watching Scottie win in person and getting to play with him.\n\n\"He's such an unbelievable guy. He talked to me numerous times throughout the round and was giving me a lot of encouragement, so it was awesome.\"",

    "fullText": "After the biggest game of the season, the Vegas Golden Knights subsequently put together their worst outing.\n\nOn Sunday, the Ottawa Senators embraced the NFL spirit and put up a touchdown and extra point on the Golden Knights, defeating them 7-1.\n\nDespite Mitch Marner getting a penalty shot early on, it was the Senators having more jump in the first period. It eventually paid off with Fabian Zetterlund firing a puck off of Kaedan Korczak behind the net to beat Adin Hill to get Ottawa off to a 1-0 start.\n\nThe second period would see the Senators take advantage after the Golden Knights missed an opportunity on a 5-on-3 power play. Dylan Cozens would make good on a scoring chance with Hill well out of position to double the Ottawa lead. 18 seconds later, Jordan Spence would beat Hill clean from the point to add to the punishment.\n\nAnother mistake allowed Stephen Halliday to push the lead to four goals, and the Golden Knights were in deep trouble.\n\nThe third period would start with Cozens and Halliday’s second goals of the game getting past Hill just over two minutes in. Former Golden Knight Nick Cousins would finish the job with the seventh Ottawa goal.\n\nIt would not be all bad for the Golden Knights, with Rasmus Andersson scoring his first goal in a Golden Knights jersey, but it was far too little, far too late.\n\nThe Andersson goal prevented the worst loss in Golden Knights franchise history. They have lost by six goals only three other times prior to tonight.\n\nThe Golden Knights will hope to rebound quickly from this embarrassment when they head to Quebec to face the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Chris Finch's voice cracked and faltered as the coach expressed on behalf of the Minnesota Timberwolves their heartbreak for the community's collective fear and pain from the ongoing immigration crackdown, following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a federal officer.\n\nFinch presents a straightforward, no-nonsense approach in his public statements and rarely reveals much emotion, but he was clearly moved by the situation in Minneapolis before his team hosted Golden State on Sunday. The game between the Timberwolves and Warriors was postponed by 24 hours, after Pretti was killed on Saturday.\n\n“I’m more than a resident. This is my home. I love living here. I love being a part of this community. I’ve been embraced from day one. People have been amazing. It’s sad to watch what is happening,” said Finch, who was hired by the Timberwolves five years ago. “On the human level, certainly as somebody who takes great pride in being here, I know a lot of our players feel the same. They all love being here, and it’s just hard to watch what we’re going through.”\n\nThe Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti prior to the national anthem, just as they did for Renee Good before their game on Jan. 8, the day after she was fatally shot by a federal officer. The Trump administration in December launched what the Department of Homeland Security declared the largest immigration enforcement operation in history and earlier this month announced a surge of more officers to push their force past 2,000.\n\nThe NBA announced Saturday that the rescheduling decision was made to “prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community” after Pretti was killed during a confrontation in a commercial district less than 2 miles south of Target Center. Finch said on Sunday that the Timberwolves pushed for the postponement to respect the public grieving process.\n\n“Playing basketball just didn't feel like the right thing to do,” Finch said, thanking the NBA and the Warriors for their support.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr, long one of the league's most outspoken coaches, was measured but clearly moved as he expressed his own sympathy.\n\n“This has always been a great stop on the NBA tour. I love the city of Minneapolis. People here are wonderful, and it’s very sad what’s happening. I feel for the city. There’s a pall that’s been cast over the city. You can feel it. A lot of people are suffering, and obviously a loss of life is the number one concern. Those families will never get their family members back,” Kerr said.\n\nTens of thousands of people swarmed downtown Minneapolis on Friday in protest of the tactics and presence of immigration officers, a crowd the Warriors could see from their hotel as it moved toward Target Center. A smaller protest march took place downtown before the game Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of other voices being raised around the sports world on Sunday. Women's basketball star Breanna Stewart held a sign with \"abolish ICE\" printed on it during introductions at her Unrivaled league game. Minnesota Frost fans during a PWHL game chanted “Ice out now!” The NBA Players Association issued a statement in support of the protests in Minnesota and urged its members to speak up.\n\nThe perspectives in a polarized country vary wildly on what constitutes constitutionally protected protesting and what becomes violent political disruption, and Kerr seemed to sense that tension as he spoke before the game on Sunday.\n\n“People are so angry. There should be an appeal to our better angels to look after one another and to recognize what’s happening. We’re being divided by media for profit, by misinformation. There’s so much out there that is really difficult for all of us to sort of reconcile,” Kerr said. “And so in times like these you have to lean on values and who you are and who you want to be, either as an individual or a country.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

    "fullText": "As the NFL makes more and more officiating misses subject to replay review, the lingering blind spots become more and more glaring.\n\nIt's time (in fact, it's long overdue) for missed facemask fouls to be called via replay.\n\nThere's no reason not to do it. Replay currently can be used to undo an erroneous facemask call. Why shouldn't it be used when a clear and obvious foul was missed?\n\nIt happened during the second quarter of Sunday's NFC Championship, when Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had his facemask grabbed on a third-down sack that forced a field goal. If the penalty hadn't been missed, the Rams would have gotten 15 yards and a fresh set of downs.\n\nSome would say the NFL resists using replay to put a flag on the field. From its inception, however, the current replay rules have allowed a penalty to be called for having too many men on the field.\n\nToday, too many things are reviewable to justify omitting something that requires no subjectivity. And it's eventually going to affect a huge game, in a huge spot.\n\nIt affected today's huge NFC Championship, ending a potential touchdown drive that could have tied the game at 10 and forcing the Rams to settle for three.

    "fullText": "Jose Ramirez is going to make history for the Cleveland Guardians originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians have secured their leading man, as Jose Ramirez has agreed to a new extension that will keep him in Cleveland until his age 39 season. The Guards are giving Ramirez a raise of sorts, with the long-time third baseman agreeing to terms on a seven-year, $175 contract extension that runs through 2032. Ramirez had three years and $69 million left on his current deal, so this new deal will see him get a bump while adding four more years to his current deal.\n\nThe extension also all but guarantees Ramirez the ability to finish his career with the Guardians and as Cleveland's all-time leader in multiple categories. Thus cementing him as the de facto all-time face of the franchise.\n\nAssuming he can stay healthy for most of the deal, he's looking at taking the top spot in numerous categories, including, but not limited to;\n\nOffensive WAR (Currently 3rd and 16.8 points behind Tris Speaker)\n\nGames Played (Currently 3rd and just 10 games off of first place, Terry Turner)\n\nAt-Bats (Currently 2nd and just 65 at-bats off of first-place Nap Lajoie)\n\nRuns Scored (Currently 3rd and 153 runs off of first-place Earl Averill)\n\nHits (Currently 7th and sits 379 hits off of Lajoie)\n\nTotal Bases (Currently 2nd and sits 193 off of Averill)\n\nDoubles (Currently 3rd and is 88 off of Speaker)\n\nHome Runs (Currently 2nd and is 52 off of Jim Thome)\n\nRBIs (Currently 2nd and is 135 off of Averill)\n\nBase on Balls (Currently 9th and is342 off of Thome)\n\nStolen Bases (Currently 2nd and is 165 off of Kenny Lofton).\n\nMost of these records will fall in the next few years, but some could take four or five at his current rate of production. He's alreadyat the top of some categories, which include;\n\nIt's pretty remarkable to see just how dominant he's been and how loyal he's been. Yet, there's also a sharp critique of the MLB in there, too. The Guardians and MLB's inability to keep players in smaller markets is the reason why this feat is not only so rare but even possible for Ramirez. With some of the biggest names in the game's history having played significant time in the city, you'd think it'd be nearly impossible for Ramirez to land atop some 15 categories. Especially ones where player skillsets don't normally overlap (home runs and stolen bases, for instance).\n\nWith teams like the LA Dodgers paying more on their luxury tax bill than the Guardians will spend on their payroll, it's becoming rarer and rarer for teams like the Guardians to keep their players, but this isn't a new issue.\n\nTeams like the Philadelphia Phillies, Boston Red Sox nd New York Yankees have historically overpaid for players, especially Cleveland's. If it weren't for the wealth discrepancy in the Major Leagues, guys like Thome, Manny Ramirez, and C.C. Sabathia may have never left Cleveland.\n\nIf that's the case, who knows if Ramirez even gets close to some of these records? Guys like Thome and Ramirez raked the ball as well as anyone historically, and each finished with Hall of Fame-worthy numbers. It would've been nearly impossible for Ramirez to take as many top spots as he's about to if some guys didn't leave due to better contracts.\n\nThat said, they did leave, and now Ramirez has the chance to cement his name all over the Cleveland history books. Which should give fans of the Guards something to hang their hat on at least.",

Tackle Garett Bolles and guard Quinn Meinerz both earned First-Team All-Pro selections, and the return of center Luke Wattenberg was expected to solidify the unit on Sunday.\n\nDenver allowed two fewer sacks than New England, but Williams and the Patriots had the last laugh after shutting the Broncos out in the second half to capture an AFC championship on the road.\n\nEarlier in the week, Williams rubbed some Broncos fans the wrong way when he was asked what he knew about Stidham.\n\n\"I ain't gonna lie, nothing. We're gonna watch the tape on him and figure out what he like to do. But no. They didn't like him over the Bo, so,\" Williams said.\n\nSome interpreted Williams' response as simple honesty, as the Patriots had never had a reason to prepare for Stidham before Nix's injury, but others saw the comment as an underestimation of the Broncos' backup quarterback.\n\nIf Denver interpreted Williams' remarks as bulletin board material, it didn't make much of a difference in the end.\n\nBest pictures in the snow from Patriots' win in Denver blizzard\n\n3 Sean Payton calls that came back to bite Broncos\n\nHow weather negatively impacted AFC championship game\n\nPatriots take advantage of controversial Drake Maye 'tush push' play",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles have a very exciting young baseball team, but last season they played far worse than expected, which led to Brandon Hyde being fired early on. During the managerial search for the right fit, the position was an attractive one given the talent on the roster. Ultimately, the Orioles decided to hire Craig Albernaz.\n\n“The Orioles’ search for a new manager is over. Baltimore has hired Cleveland associate manager Craig Albernaz to become its skipper, the club announced Monday,” MLB.com’s Jake Rill wrote.\n\nThe Orioles have had a huge offseason so far, even though most of their moves came at the start of free agency. Acquiring Pete Alonso was a major coup, alongside several other additions. With some names still left on the market, Baltimore could also pursue Framber Valdez.\n\n“Baltimore has already committed $195 million to four free agents -- Pete Alonso, Ryan Helsley, Zach Eflin and Leody Taveras -- ranking sixth in spending thus far. But general manager Mike Elias, entering the final year of his contract, has one more haymaker left: Framber Valdez. With Ranger Suárez landing $130 million over five years in Boston, Valdez projects to get around six years and $180 million -- a deal that would vault the O's past the Dodgers and Blue Jays as baseball's top free agent spenders,” ESPN’s Paul Hembekides wrote.\n\nAdding Valdez would be huge for the Orioles, bolstering their rotation significantly. Part of the reason his free-agent market has dragged on is the controversy over a questionable pitch-crossing incident.\n\n“Both Framber Valdez and César Salazar were brought into the manager’s office after the game. Valdez is said to have apologized to Salazar but said the cross-up was not on purpose,” JomBoy Media wrote.\n\nIf the cross-up wasn’t intentional, then Valdez has no character concerns, allowing the Orioles to pursue the World Series–winning lefty without hesitation. Baltimore is eager to return to the playoffs after their 100-win season just a couple of years ago.\n\nValdez would likely play a major role in that push, as the Orioles aim to rebound after a disappointing 2025. While only time will tell, this move would help Baltimore compete in a stacked AL East.",

    "fullText": "Bills coaching rumors tracker: Latest news on Brian Daboll, Joe Brady, other potential Sean McDermott replacements originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills became the tenth team to fire their head coach in the 2025-2026 season as they parted ways with Sean McDermott. He was hired ahead of the 2017 season and amassed a 98-50 regular-season record.\n\nMcDermott was let go after another early playoff exit. He went 8-8 in the postseason and never won in the AFC Championship Game to make the Super Bowl.\n\nThis puts some pressure on the possible head coaching candidate for the Bills. McDermott won the AFC East five of the last six seasons. Buffalo believes it is in win-now mode, and the new head coach will be expected to hit the ground running and may not have a year or two to ease into the gig. This suggests that the Bills will target experienced head coaches, which makes the hiring process all the more interesting.\n\nHere are the latest rumors on Buffalo's coaching search.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best Bills coaching candidates to replace Sean McDermott\n\nBills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, also a top candidate for a promotion to head coach in Buffalo, is in Las Vegas on Sunday for a second interview for the Raiders' head coaching job, per Schefter.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Buffalo completed an interview with the Jaguars' offensive coordinator Grant Udinski. Udinski is a fast-rising 30-year-old assistant who has already garnered significant interest from other teams, including the Cleveland Browns.\n\nRapoport reports that former quarterback Philip Rivers is under \"serious consideration\" for the Buffalo Bills' head coaching vacancy after an impressive in-person interview. Despite Rivers having only high school coaching experience, his strong relationship with Josh Allen and his reputation as a charismatic leader have made him a legitimate candidate to replace Sean McDermott.\n\nThe Bills have interviewed former quarterbacks Philip Rivers and Davis Webb for their open head coaching position. Both of them, as well as current quarterback Josh Allen, share the same agent.\n\nBuffalo fielded an interview with Miami defensive coordinator  Anthony Weaver on Saturday. The former Ravens and Texans defensive end has been a hot name in the coaching carousel in recent years, also drawing interest from the Ravens and Steelers in their head-coaching searches.\n\nFormer Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel has already accepted a job as the Los Angeles Chargers' new offensive coordinator, though the contract remains unsigned. This was more of a backup plan for him, as he is still eligible to interview for head coaching roles. McDaniel was expected to interview with the Browns and the Bills last week but backed out of both.\n\nMcDaniel was scheduled to meet with the Bills on Friday, January 23.\n\nRivers came out of retirement to play for the Indianapolis Colts at the end of the year, and he did say he might be interested in coaching once he retires for good. Rivers has experience coaching high school football, but none at the pro level.\n\nWe have completed an interview with Philip Rivers for our head coaching position.\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) January 23, 2026\n\nLynn will interview on Saturday as part of a busy weekend for the Bills interview team, as all these interviews will take place in Florida. The former Los Angeles Chargers coach spent a few seasons in Buffalo as an assistant coach under Rex Ryan, and even coached one game as an interim head coach.\n\nMcDaniel agreed to take the Los Angeles Chargers offensive coordinator job, but that is only if he doesn'd land a head coaching opportunity. The former Miami Dolphins head coach played the Bills twice a season in the AFC East for the last four years.\n\nNext up on the Bills interview list is Brian Daboll. The 50-year-old was Buffalo's offensive coordinator from 2018-21, parlaying his success with the Josh Allen-attack into a head-coaching gig with the Giants. Per Russini, Daboll's covets the Bills position. He'll get his first chance to push for the role on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to the media alongside owner Terry Pegula, Bills GM Brandon Beane said Wednesday that the team will conduct \"100 percent an open search,\" with Josh Allen expected to have input. Beane says the list of candidates the Bills plan to interview includes coaches still coaching in the playoffs.\n\nThe Bills' fifth and sixth interview requests went out to Jaguars OC Grant Udinski and Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver. Udinski, who would be the youngest head coach in NFL history if hired, has a second interview lined up with the Browns, while Weaver is a candidate for the Ravens and Steelers jobs.\n\nThe first defensive-minded candidate for the Bills is Colts DC Lou Anarumo, who has never been an NFL head coach but has drawn interest for his work between Cincinnati and Indianapolis. Anarumo is the fourth known head coaching candidate for the Bills.\n\nThe Bills will interview Anthony Lynn, Brian Daboll, and Joe Brady for their head coaching job, making that trio the first three confirmed candidates.\n\nLynn, formerly the head coach of the Chargers and once a Bills assistant, is currently the Commanders’ running game coordinator, while Brady is the Bills’ offensive coordinator and Daboll held that role from 2018-21 before becoming the Giants’ head coach.\n\nDaboll is likely going to be a coaching candidate for the open job in Buffalo. Despite what happened during his tenure with the New York Giants, he did serve as the Bills' offensive coordinator from 2018 to 2021. This coincided with the first four seasons of Allen's career, so Daboll helped provide a foundation for the quarterback.\n\nIn the four seasons with Daboll as the OC, Allen played in 61 games and had 14,114 passing yards with 100 touchdowns and 46 interceptions. He added 2,325 rushing yards with 31 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nThe quarterback has played in 67 games without Daboll as his OC. In that span, he has 15,988 yards with 117 touchdowns and 48 interceptions. Allen has 2,396 rushing yards with 48 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nMORE: What's next for Sean McDermott?\n\nBrady is the current offensive coordinator for the Bills. He would help to provide consistency in the organization, but Buffalo would have to decide if it trusts that the OC has something in him to get past the postseason hump that plagued McDermott's tenure.\n\nHe served as the quarterbacks coach in 2022 and 2023 before being promoted to interim offensive coordinator in 2023. He was made the permanent offensive coordinator in 2024, coincidentally the year that Allen won his first MVP Award.\n\nMORE: Why did the Bills fire Sean McDermott?\n\nIn the two full seasons with Brady as the OC, Allen has played in 34 games and had 7,399 yards with 53 touchdowns and 16 interceptions with an additional 1,110 yards and 26 touchdowns on the ground.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have spent the last season engineering a remarkable turnaround, and on Sunday, they stunned the NFL by completing their journey back to the Super Bowl with an AFC Championship win over the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Patriots captured a 10-7 win over the Broncos in a defensive struggle that turned out to be the second consecutive snow game for New England. And despite the challenging wintry environment and natural atmospheric challenges that accompany a trip to Empower Field at Mile High, the Patriots took care of business for their 17th victory of the season, returning to the Super Bowl for the first time since capturing Super Bowl LIII at the close of the 2018 season.\n\nThe Super Bowl appearance for the Patriots puts the cherry on top of a remarkable season that has gone better for the organization than any of their fans – or really anyone who follows the league – could have imagined. The Patriots are coming off back-to-back four-win seasons and are in their first season under the leadership of head coach Mike Vrabel, who previously captured three Super Bowls as a player with the franchise.\n\nThe Patriots will face the winner of the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, as the NFC West Divisional Rivals battle in a rubber match on Sunday night in the NFC Championship Game after splitting their first two games of the year.

    "fullText": "It all started a week or two ago, when my partner Maartje found a Dutch translation of Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park somewhere. It is an original 1991 edition. This means the cover image had been produced before the movie was made. It is necessarily completely free of the iconography of the film that would come to overshadow the novel, and indeed overshadow all other dinosaur media. That logo, that skeleton, that font, the designs of those dinosaurs and those characters which are all etched into our collective consciousness, none of it shows up on the cover. It’s a thing unto itself, and it is a thing to behold indeed. I’ll show it to you in a minute, but it got me thinking.\n\nHow many more of these are out there? How many localizations of Crichton’s sci-fi novel have been produced around the world, with unique cover art that predates the Spielberg film? How many of these were produced by book cover artists who in normal circumstances would have never illustrated anything close to a dinosaur? I took to the Internet, and the results exceeded all my expectations. It is true that most versions of the book you can get nowadays simply have the well-known logo on the cover. Boring! Nevertheless, I found a wealth of unique and remarkable, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, book covers that are independent from the visual language of the movie. Not all of these predate the film proper, but they were still unique enough to include. As a connoisseur of kitschy dinosaur Europeana, I’m gonna review a bunch o them! And I’ll save the Dutch one for last, because I’m a tease like that.\n\nLet’s start in Italy. This, too, is a 1991 original (the novel itself is from 1990, but translations take a while). I must admit that, in most cases, I have no idea who produced these book covers; I’m not quite committed enough to get a copy of all of these myself to find out. That’s a shame, because as far as these go, I see a pretty servicable dinosaur here. Believe me, they get much worse… The eagle-eyed among you will have recognized the influence of Burian, specifically his 1959 Allosaurus. The environment it’s stomping around in looks less like a high-tech theme park in the Costa Rican jungle and more like a cheap resort in Florida. I bet that house looked like that before the dinosaur attack. The dinosaur looks smaller than you’d expect, too, compared to these humans. Poundland Jurassic Park. A nice pulpy book cover, very appropriate for the novel.\n\nStaying in Southern Europe, this 1992 Spanish edition is simultaneously more stylish and more freaky. This highly stylized dinosaur looks more like some quadrupedal mammalian monster rearing up, some sort of awful earless dog. The stance and forelimbs are obviously referenced from a four-legged animal. Sit, Rex. This is what happens when an artist with no prior experience in dinosaurs, no relevant palaeoart reference points, and no internet tries this sort of thing; it can only happen in very specific circumstances, and it could not happen today. That’s why these vintage covers are irresistible to me.\n\nThis Polish edition comes not with a cover illustration, but with model photography. It’s a perfectly decent 1990s T. rex model, better than any toy from around this time anyway. However, it’s still obviously made of plastic and gives the book a slightly cheap vibe. Would you be seen on the train reading this?\n\nApparently, this is what the original 1991 German edition looked like. Sadly, I’ve found no higher resolution image than this. It might be faked, but it’s extremely eccentric anyway. Thanks to Maike for sending me a good photo! It’s real! A stylized, simplified cover in jolly primary colours with a jolly dinosaur silhouette, complete with jolly bizarro proportions. Those long arms are really something. According to the comments, it’s based on Peter Zallinger. I just know that the shadowy guy running away is the same dork who waves at all the dinosaurs in all the size charts on Wikipedia. Those playful fonts and colours don’t really sell the danger of the story to me. I love how the original German title of the book was just “Dinopark”.\n\nThere’s been a ton of different German editions over the years. Many of these are delightfully offbeat. Here’s another model T. rex in extreme close up. The infamous Jurassic Park font makes an appearance here, so we’re post-movie.\n\nGermany is the gift that keeps giving; this one is as recent as 2005. This one is especially baffling. The font in the title could be that a romance novel. The backround is a swamp, while the dinosaur model looks especially cheap and ugly. The German text on the cover explains how this novel and Spielberg’s film conquered the world. Just a complete mishmash of unrelated elements on this book cover.\n\nAnother German-language edition. This might be the Austrian one, though I’m not sure. This is the most stylish one we’ve seen so far, and for obvious reason: plagiarism! You’ve no doubt recognized Burian’s heroic Tarbosaurus on the cover here, even if it has been silhouetted out and given a different background. I won’t deny this looks cool, though. You can’t go wrong with Burian.\n\nSpeaking of Burian: what about Czechia? Disappointingly, the land that brought forth the world’s greatest palaeoartist has to make do with nothing but re-used stock art on the cover. If you’re my age, you will probably recognize this as the Neil Lloyd T. rex from Dinosaurs! Magazine! It doesn’t look like a whole lot of effort went into this book cover.\n\nBut we can always do worse. Here’s a later Czech version, with none other than the Papo T. rex on the cover! Absolutely no shame. Zdeněk must be turning in his grave.\n\nHere’s at last something that looks like original artwork to me. Or is this something pre-existing, cut out from its original background? Anyway, this is an Hungarian edition. Nothing especially noteworthy here; just a slightly dodgy drooling dinosaur.\n\nThis one is also Hungarian. From 1996, so the movie logo makes an appearance, but it’s weird enough to be interesting. At the top, we see a bizarre, goofy, wild-eyed cartoon dinosaur in various stages of polygonal rendering… did the cover artist confuse genetic research with computer generated art? It does look oddly frog-like, that’s an important plot point in the story. The rex skull is absent from the logo, where’d it go? I think this is the sequel, The Lost World. Sziget means island (as every European hipster definitely knows), so this reads “Monster Island”, while the above means “Park of Primitive Creatures”. I also appreciate how the author of this book is called Cmriicchhateoln. Graphic Design is my passion!\n\nI’m a big fan of this Swedish edition. It captures some of that childlike wonder. There’s a bit of Burian in that T. rex, and maybe a bit of Bernard Robinson? Copied from one of those ubiquitous 80s/90s T. rex images you’d see places. I don’t know, I’ve seen so much of this stuff, man. The covers uses a variation of the Jurassic Park Neuland font, so it must be a post-movie edition.\n\nRussia can always be relied upon for quality idiosyncratic covers, and they do not disappoint. The dinosaur that greets us on this purple cover is even cute, with those big hamster cheeks and friendly eyes. At the same time, it’s not the worst T. rex we’ve seen on these covers by a long shot, with the shape of the skull actually quite well observed. I have a hard time finding this one scary, though.\n\nHere’s another Russian edition, and this has to be one of my favourites. The creature on the cover here looks as much like a dragon as it does a dinosaur. Contrasting with the previous one, this is a completely fanciful creature that is, again, not produced by anyone who’s ever done dinosaurs before. It doesn’t even have arms. If anything, this looks like the skull lizard creatures of Kong: Skull Island. The typography and design on this one are absolutely 90s-tastic.\n\nOut of the many Russian editions I found, this one looks the classiest. As I live and breathe, that looks like an honest-to-Zeus piece of actual competent palaeoart on the cover! It could be Greg Paul or one of his disciples. I hope it wasn’t stolen. The elegant font completes the picture. I don’t like the orange, though.\n\nAnother favourite is this Turkish version, from 1993. It came out to tie in with the film, but the artwork is original. Once again, our T. rex is completely monstrous and out there. It’s based on Frazetta, probably. It’s more of a vintage guy-in-a-suit Godzilla than anything, and the sauropods haven’t got the memo yet about how they’re not supposed to be in the water. The scalation on the T. rex is interesting, they look less like the big scales of an animal and more like rocks, as if the creature is some sort of golem, made from the very Earth itself. This vintage Turkish edition was on sale for the better part of 100 dollars, which goes some ways towards explaining why I decided against starting a collection of these.\n\nMost Asian editions of the novel didn’t come out before the film, so those covers are overwhelmingly film-related, and not very interesting. An exception is this 1996 Thai version. Again, I think this this the sequel. Although the logo, the gate and the font are all there from the film, we do get some original, illustrated dinosaurs. I say “original”. Rather than Burian, the inspiration this time seems to have been John Sibbick, his highly recognizable T. rex and Velociraptor dutifully traced. I wish I had a higher resolution version of this one.\n\nAnd here’s the Dutch version that I promised you! I don’t mean to brag, but surely this is the king of weird vintage JP book covers? Look at that thing! What is even going on here? Is this made by someone who not only has never illustrated a dinosaur before, but never even seen a dinosaur before? What is going on with that arm? How does its neck work? Is that its back? Look at that five-fingered hand. Wait, which way does its knee bend? Is its leg backwards, or am I? What even is reality? Is that the face of 1998 Godzilla? I’m so confused. Please send help. Anyway, I have this one, so I can tell you who’s responsible. The image is credited to the brothers Schriemer who studied in the same town as me, so credit where credit is due. Er gaat niets boven Groningen. Five stars.",

    "description": "World’s top TikTok creator Khaby Lame seals a $900 million deal, becoming a controlling shareholder as the creator economy shifts toward equity ownership",
    "fullText": "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-born TikTok star with the largest following on the platform, has struck a landmark commercial deal valued at approximately $900 million, marking one of the most significant monetisation moves ever by a global digital creator.\n\nThe transaction involves the partial sale of his company, Step Distinctive Limited, to Rich Sparkle Holdings, a United States-listed firm that disclosed the acquisition alongside a broader strategic partnership focused on scaling Lame’s commercial operations worldwide.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rich Sparkle, through its operating partners, will hold exclusive rights to Khaby Lame’s global commercial activities for an initial period of 36 months.\n\nThese rights cover brand partnerships, endorsements, licensing, and e-commerce ventures, signalling a shift from traditional influencer marketing to a platform-driven business model.\n\nRich Sparkle estimates that the integrated structure combining traffic, fulfilment, operations, and proprietary technology could eventually generate more than $4 billion in annual sales once fully implemented.\n\nAs part of the deal, Khaby Lame will become a controlling shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings, positioning him not just as a creative partner but as an equity stakeholder in the commercial infrastructure built around his brand.\n\n“This is not just an equity acquisition, but a revolution in the global content e-commerce model,” the company said, adding that the combination of a US-listed platform, globally recognised content IP, and supply chain expertise could unlock unprecedented shareholder value.\n\nThe rollout of the commercial strategy will initially focus on the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with execution planned over the next three years. Rich Sparkle will work with Anhui Xiaoheiyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based content commerce operator with experience in large-scale creator-led e-commerce.\n\nKhaby Lame rose to global prominence through silent, minimalist videos that humorously dismantle overly complicated life hacks. His wordless format has allowed him to transcend language barriers and build a vast, culturally diverse audience at remarkable speed.\n\nHe currently commands an estimated 360 million followers across social media platforms, making him one of the most influential digital figures in the world and a rare example of truly global creator reach.\n\nBeyond conventional commerce, the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\nRich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\nThe broader strategy also includes premium brand collaborations and co-branded intellectual property in sectors such as beauty, fragrance, and apparel, highlighting how creator influence is increasingly being transformed into long-term industrial-scale businesses.",

    "description": "More than 36,500 Iranians were killed by security forces during the January 8-9 crackdown on nationwide protests, making it the deadliest two-day protest massacre in history, according to documents reviewed by Iran International's Editorial Board.",
    "fullText": "For more than two weeks and counting, the country has existed inside a manufactured silence. The public internet, the basic infrastructure of modern life, has been reduced to rumor and fragments. What remains functional are the regime’s approved channels, whitelisted networks that keep the state connected to itself while cutting the country off from civic circulation.\n\nFrom outside Iran, this condition is often described as another episode of unrest. From inside, it feels closer to a new revolution that has already cost the country thousands of lives.\n\nIran has experienced a massacre and entered a post-massacre moment, a phase in which the state no longer performs restraint. It kills, buries, rewrites the narrative, and disconnects.\n\nThe blackout is not a byproduct of disorder. It is part of the machinery. Violence is easier to carry out when it is harder to document, and easier to deny when proof is delayed, partial, or erased.\n\nFrom the studio of The Program with Kambiz Hosseini, where Iranians have been calling into a live call-in program broadcast to Iran, the question no longer sounds abstract. It sounds prosecutorial.\n\nWhat, exactly, does the world believe it is watching?\n\nThe calls do not arrive as speeches. They arrive as exertion, as voices pushing through dead air and dropped connections.\n\nAli, calling from Mazandaran in northern Iran, addresses the security forces directly. “You do not need to put your weapon down. No one is afraid of you.” He repeats it, not as bravado, but as fact. Fear, he suggests, is no longer the organizing principle.\n\nPouria, calling from Shiraz in southern Iran, offers a different register. “We did not abandon a single wounded person, and we did not allow anyone to be left behind or written off.” The language is practical, almost logistical. It describes a moral line that held even as institutions collapsed. Do not leave anyone behind.\n\nBahram, from a working-class neighborhood in southern Tehran, explains why he went into the streets. “For my country, and for my children.” It is not an ideological statement. It is an intergenerational one.\n\nMahsa, from Najafabad, asks for something simpler. “I want to tell the story of my city.” The request itself is an indictment. In Iran today, telling the story of a place can be an act of defiance.\n\nFrom the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, Alia’s anger is controlled and unsentimental. “You thought we were afraid. We are not afraid. We are angry, and we are waiting.” She repeats it, sharpening the point. “They think we are afraid. We are not. We are angry, and we are waiting.” She does not ask to be comforted. She asks to be heard.\n\nThese voices share a quality that has become rare in authoritarian systems. They are unembellished. They do not seek spectacle. They insist on being recorded.\n\nThat insistence recalls the life of Raha Bohlouli-Pour, a university student who was shot and killed by Iranian security forces near Fatemi Square in Tehran on January 8, 2026. Raha, whose name in Farsi means free, was interested in art and music, according to her online profiles.\n\nShe was not an organizer or a public figure. She carried no slogans and belonged to no faction. In a political culture trained to search for enemies, she was unexceptional.\n\nRaha did not die because she exercised power or issued demands. She died because she embodied a way of being the state has learned to fear. Her generation does not aspire to heroic gestures or sacrificial myths. It seeks something quieter and more difficult to suppress, the right to live an ordinary life with dignity, continuity, and attention. To breathe without permission. To imagine tomorrow without explanation.\n\nShe left behind no manifesto. What remains are fragments, short reflections, carefully chosen lines. Her language returns again and again to elemental concerns, breathing, continuing, tomorrow. Even when fear appears, it is not dramatized. Her writing is restrained and lucid. If it is political, it is so in the most basic sense. It insists that being alive is not negotiable.\n\nOne detail matters. Raha wrote names. She named detainees and the missing. She recorded people as people, not as abstractions. She understood how repression begins, not with bullets, but with erasure. Violence becomes easier once names disappear and individuals dissolve into numbers.\n\nThat is why the callers matter. They produce the most destabilizing thing such a state can face, a record. Names. Places. Timelines. Descriptions of fear moving through neighborhoods, and of solidarity moving faster. Strangers pulling one another out of danger. Shopkeepers closing doors. Families taking risks that would be unthinkable in a normal society.\n\nNavid, a physician from Tehran, describes hospitals overwhelmed, security forces stationed inside wards, families pleading for information, and staff pushed beyond exhaustion into something closer to moral injury. He does not sound ideological. He sounds like someone trying, with diminishing success, to remain human inside a system designed to punish humanity.\n\nThe numbers, always and only the numbers, arrive as estimates.\n\nOne widely cited figure suggests the death toll may exceed twenty thousand. Whether the final count is higher or lower will matter to historians and prosecutors. The deeper point is simpler. The state has made counting dangerous, and then uses uncertainty as camouflage.\n\nThis is what post-massacre means.\n\nNot only that people have been killed, but that proving they were killed becomes a second battlefield.\n\nPeople no longer sound shocked. They sound worn down by the reliability of cruelty.\n\nIran today is no longer merely in internal crisis. When a government treats its own population as an enemy force, the consequences do not remain contained. They ripple outward through refugee flows, regional instability, and a precedent that other regimes quietly study.\n\nThe calls continue coming into the show. Not because a phone line can defeat a security apparatus, but because history is written by those who insist on being counted as human.\n\nThe state can disrupt the signal. It cannot fully erase the insistence.\n\nThat insistence, name by name and breath by breath, may be the most dangerous thing in Iran right now.\n\nWhat we are witnessing in Iran today can be categorized as a crime against humanity.",

    "title": "A developer teamed up with Claude to create Elo programming language",
    "description": "feature: Bernard Lambeau, the human half of a pair programming team, explains how he's using AI",
    "fullText": "feature Bernard Lambeau, a Belgium-based software developer and founder of several technology companies, created a programming language called Elo with the help of Anthropic's Claude Code.\n\nStarting on December 25, 2025, he published a series of posts about the project. The first post names Claude as a co-author.\n\n\"In roughly 24 hours of collaboration, we built a complete expression language with a parser, type system, three compilers, a standard library, a CLI tool, and a documentation website. Not bad for a day's work,” Lambeau and Claude wrote.\n\n\"Elo isn't just a demonstration that AI can write code. It's a demonstration that humans and AI can build together – each contributing what they do best,” they added.\n\nAs an expression language that compiles to JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL, Elo is intended as a portable way to handle form validation, e-commerce order processing, and subscription logic.\n\nLambeau, founder and CTO of Klaro Cards and CEO of app consultancy Enspirit, is not the first to develop a programming language with the help of AI.\n\nSteve Klabnik performed a similar feat last year with the Rue programming language. In September 2025, Geoffrey Huntley enlisted Claude to write a programming language called Cursed. And before that, Avital Tamir published a Claude-authored repo for the Server programming language, with the caveat that the code is not intended for actual use.\n\nClaude Code isn't the only AI-assisted programming method having a moment. AI biz Cursor created a rudimentary browser using OpenAI's GPT-5.2. And developer Ola Prøis used Cursor, powered by Claude, to create a Rust-based text editor called Ferrite.\n\nClaude users generally acknowledge that their pair partner makes mistakes. But those committed to AI assistance find it worthwhile to clean up after their helper.\n\n\"Claude Code knows almost every tech stack (and can search the web), knows the Linux commands that matter (search code, search & replace, compile, test, etc.), and does that 10x faster than I can do myself,\" Lambeau told The Register in an email interview.\n\nClaude, he said, allows him to use technology he hasn't mastered.\n\n\"I was already a full-stack developer (on languages, frameworks & reusable libraries I knew); I'm now a full-stack++ dev because I can also use languages, frameworks, and reusable libraries I barely know, if at all,\" he explained.\n\n\"Claude Code falls short if you don't have a great methodology. It needs feedback loops to work fine; otherwise, it derails. One possible feedback loop is a human reviewing code and testing manually. But there's a better/complementary approach if you want it to work autonomously. On both Elo and Bmg.js, I've started by making sure the testing methodology was effective and scientifically sound. Claude writes the tests, executes them, discovers where it's wrong, and corrects itself. Impressive.\"\n\nLambeau said he still needs to review some of Claude's output.\n\n\"But if I read the tests, agree with them, and can check myself that they run fine, I'm 95 percent sure it's already correct as a black box (not even reading the code),\" he explained. \"Then I can check the architecture and code quality as a white box by having a general look at the code, but I don't have to understand every detail.\"\n\nNotably, Lambeau documented the series of prompts he used to create the language. The repo includes more than 100 tasks used to direct the AI model. In addition, Lambeau has published a video that describes his AI pair programming process.\n\n\"I started in a setting where Claude Code asked for permissions every 20 seconds and I was checking everything it did,\" Lambeau explained. \"After a few successes, I quickly set up safe environments to be able to let Claude Code run in full autonomy (isolated computer & isolated Linux user, or running in a Docker image).\"\n\nLambeau said he still uses plan mode for complex tasks that require conversation with Claude.\n\n\"I review the plan, make sure we have a test strategy that's sound, then switch Claude to autonomous mode and look at the tests, code & results afterward,\" he said. \"That's very similar to a lead-dev/CTO + QA role, btw; it's just much faster than with human devs.\"\n\nLambeau, who has a PhD in software engineering and 30 years of experience as a developer, said both experts and novices can benefit from Claude Code, though he added that a service like Lovable might be more approachable for those not already acclimated to the command line.\n\n\"Now, when it comes to real software/product engineering, I think Claude Code requires experts (so far),\" he said. \"You still need to guide it a lot to keep the quality high enough. You need very strong expertise to do it effectively. Currently (Claude will still improve a lot), if you don't have the expertise, you certainly end up with a big mess of unmaintainable code.\"\n\nMany developers have said as much about AI tools. They're more useful as an amplifier of expertise than as a replacement for it. The situation is analogous to the introduction of sequencing software, digital synthesizers, and drum machines half a century ago. These tools enabled a lot of people who weren't great musicians to make music. But they didn't instill musical skill, and they produced the most interesting work in the hands of practiced musicians.\n\nThe cost to do this, Lambeau said, has been a Claude Max subscription that he purchased in December for €180 a month. In that time, he says, he wrote Elo (https://elo-lang.org), completed Bmg.js (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg.js), completed Bmg's documentation (https://www.relational-algebra.dev), and created the first version of the Try page (https://www.relational-algebra.dev/try).\n\n\"It's all personal research and open-source projects,\" he said. \"It would have required several weeks to do the same manually myself, and several months to ask another developer to do it. The cost would be mostly because of the scientific & technical knowledge transfer about the data language I envision. Strangely enough, it's very cheap with Claude Code. There's something true about the fact that those LLMs have a PhD.\"\n\nLambeau explained that Elo isn't just a way to test Claude Code. He also sees it as an extension of his academic work in software engineering and his personal interest in the Relational Model – he's served as a lecturer for database courses at Belgium’s UCLouvain.\n\n\"I'm absolutely convinced that we need better/safer/simpler programming languages inside no-code tools and when interconnecting them (e.g. Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.),\" he said. \"Mainstream programming languages are very complex, error-prone, sometimes dangerous, and the programs are difficult to review for non-experts.\"\n\n\"More importantly, they are cumbersome to use for even simple data tasks. I mean, even validating the schema and constraints of a data file at runtime tends to be a nightmare in existing languages. It's not built-in in any mainstream language; you immediately need validation libraries; most of them are limited in what they can easily check, so you need to add dedicated boilerplate code.\"\n\nIn a world where non-technical people will have the opportunity to write untrustworthy code with the help of AI, he said, we need to be able to run that code safely.\n\n\"Elo aims at providing a safe & simple alternative,\" he said. \"It will be a limited language (non-Turing-complete, as we say) but super safe & simple, and usable in 80 percent of common data use cases. The very first no-code tool to integrate it will be Klaro Cards, of course.\" ®",

By the point\nthat I left, zero teams had been hired through the BYOT mechanism, although we did talk to some.\nOn the other hand, one of the hiring ideas that Stripe didn’t blog about publicly,\nbut worked extremely well in practice, is the idea of Lighthouse Hiring.\n\nLighthouse Hiring is the idea that hiring well-connected folks makes subsequent\nhires both easier and higher quality. Sure, hiring those well-known folks is\ndifficult, but if you’re trying to hire ten great people, then spending more\ntime hiring one “lighthouse hire” can improve the quality and velocity of the overall hiring push.\n\nA few examples of Stripe’s lighthouse hiring:\n\nThere are many other examples you could pick from, and importantly not all of them are widely-known,\njust widely-connected.\nJulia is a tech internet mainstay, but Raylene operated more from personal\nnetworks rather than social media networks. Any sort of high quality network\ncan be the underpinning of a successful lighthouse hire.\n\nThis mechanism worked exceptionally well, but there is a complex underside\nto Lighthouse Hires: strong networks, particularly publicly visible networks,\ncreate a complex power dynamic that some managers can struggle to navigate.\nIf you’re relying on a public personality, and they get frustrated at work,\nthen your lighthouse hiring strategy is going to implode on you.\nSimilarly, hiring them to begin with can be a challenge if\nyou don’t have an interesting role, but carving out a uniquely interesting\nrole for one hire will come across as biased internally, undermining your relationship\nwith the broader team.\n\nThese are all navigable, and I think Stripe would have been less successful\nif it hadn’t used this pattern, but it takes some nuance to deploy effectively.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft recently announced it will deprecate System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) Management Packs (MPs) for SQL Server Reporting Services, Power BI Report Server,and SQL Server Analysis Services.\n\nWhile this affects a relatively small subset of SQL Server users, the move could force some organizations into monitoring solutions that expose their server deployments to Microsoft's licensing auditors, one analyst pointed out.\n\nThe affected SCOM management packs will remain available until January 2027, after which they'll no longer be supported. \"No new updates will be released, including no support for SQL Server 2025 or SCOM 2025,\" the notice said.\n\nMicrosoft said the products would no longer have official SCOM MPs for these products.\n\nSCOM is a popular management tool for Microsoft on-premises server product, supporting not just SQL Server, but also Exchange, Windows and SharePoint to manage updates, security changes, and patches.\n\nMicrosoft said the deprecation means existing management packs would continue to function in SCOM 2019 and SCOM 2022, but no new features, fixes, or security updates would be provided. And compatibility with later versions can not be guaranteed.\n\nThe software giant recommended affected users plan their migration to Azure-based monitoring solutions using Azure Monitor, Azure Arc and Log Analytics. This creates \"a unified alternative that offers centralized telemetry ingestion, alerting, performance monitoring, and dashboarding for hybrid and on‑premises environments,\" the vendor claimed.\n\nAndrew Snodgrass, analyst with Directions on Microsoft, said the Windows giant had ignored SCOM for a while, and he was advising clients to move away from it.\n\n\"Find a third party if you want to stay on-prem, but Microsoft's gonna start slowly killing this thing off the way they do,\" he told The Reg. With the alternative, customers can no longer download updates directly; they can only do it through Azure Arc, and in the process, they have to register their on-prem servers in Azure.\n\nSnodgrass said the Azure monitoring platform offered some \"really cool stuff\" for managing a SQL Server estate, especially hybrid users.\n\n\"What it requires is that – quite reasonably – you install an agent on your physical server or on your virtual server, whether that's in AWS, Azure or on-prem. This is the Azure Arc monitoring agent that is going to run locally, and it's going to connect up to Azure,\" he said.\n\nFrom a management point of view it works well, added Snodgrass, because admins can use a single Azure SQL management system and see all the servers and databases, regardless of their environment.\n\n\"But those who don't want to use Azure, or want to remain on-prem, will need to find an alternative local third-party management tool. SQL Server has been out for decades, so there's some really lovely management tools. There are also a few that will also manage your Windows Server and your Exchange servers as well.\"\n\nAlthough Microsoft has given no indication that the data could be used for anything other than software management, users should be aware that there is the potential for implications when it comes to license management.\n\n\"If you use the Azure SQL to manage all of these deployments, wherever they are, whether they're on prem or in AWS or Azure, then you're registering every one of your SQL Servers with Azure. That list is going to be out. Doesn't mean that Microsoft necessarily would, but if an audit comes along, they certainly could go out there and say, 'You know what, you've got this whole list here, and we look at the license count that you bought from us, and you don't have enough licenses to cover all these servers you've deployed',\" he said.\n\nOrganizations deliberately using unlicensed software do not have much of a defense, but there are grey areas, such as downloading SQL Server for software development using a Visual Studio license.\n\n\"If I were monitoring and managing all this stuff through the Azure tools, it can't delineate between production and development, and it would assume that all for those are production machines, and therefore I should buy licenses for them.\"\n\nSnodgrass advises clients to get a clear picture of the number of SQL Servers in production and those used for development before negotiating with Microsoft over licenses.\n\nThe Register has asked Microsoft to comment. ®",

    "title": "'Super' Battleship USS Texas Relocating With A Major Facelift In 2026",
    "description": "The USS Texas has endured a lot since it was commissioned in 1914, and 2026 will see it on display in refurbished condition in a brand-new location.",
    "fullText": "Though the American battleship has long since been overshadowed as the U.S. Navy's most prolific and strategically important warship by the aircraft carrier, World War II-era battleships will forever be a crucial part of naval history. Fortunately for fans of American military and naval history, there are several U.S. battleships open to the public across the United States, where these classic vessels can be toured and appreciated.\n\nThe first of these museum battleships was the USS Texas (BB-35), which has been owned and operated by the State of Texas as a memorial since the late 1940s. With a history that predates other battleships like the Missouri and Iowa, the Texas is America's only surviving warship to have fought in both World Wars. And now, after years of uncertainty, the future of this historic vessel is looking bright, with work underway to move the ship to a new permanent home at the Port of Galveston.\n\nAnd when the new and improved USS Texas Museum opens, it won't just be displayed as an old and dilapidated relic. Instead, it will be a ship that will have undergone a thorough and costly $75 million restoration process to bring it back to its full, period-correct, World War II glory.\n\nMost of America's battleship museums are ships of the Iowa Class, which were commissioned during World War II and served into the 1990s. The Texas represents a much older era of battleships that played a pivotal role in both major theaters of World War II. Commissioned in 1914 as one of the U.S. Navy's two New York-class ships (which the Scientific American referred to as \"super dreadnoughts\"), the Texas quickly went into service supporting American interests during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I, the Texas went to the North Sea, where it served as part of the historic Grand Fleet that oversaw the surrender of the Germans.\n\nThe Texas was modernized in the years between the wars, before again entering combat service in the Atlantic when World War II broke out. The USS Texas first supported the Allies during the North Africa campaign, then attacked German targets and supported the Allied Invasion force at Omaha Beach on D-Day in 1944. The ship would return to the U.S. for more modernizations before being sent to the Pacific Theater to fight the Japanese during the American invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\n\nFinally, the Texas ended its naval service by bringing American soldiers and sailors home during Operation Magic Carpet Ride in the months following the war. With newer battleships in the fleet and an increased focus on carriers, the aging ship was decommissioned and donated to the State of Texas in 1948.\n\nThe USS Texas was the first American battleship to become a permanent museum, located at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site. After decades on display and, with the ship's condition deteriorating, the Texas was moved to dry dock in 2022 to begin a series of repairs and renovations. Not only are these renovations addressing serious structural issues that would cause the ship to take on water, but the Texas is also receiving a full restoration with rebuilt structures, a new wooden deck, and fresh paint throughout to preserve the atmosphere of its combat days. So far, the process has required over 400,000 hours of labor, with over 700 tons of steel being replaced.\n\nWith the extensive four-plus-year restoration nearing completion at the start of 2026, the ship has secured its new home at Pier 15 in Galveston, where plans are underway for dredging, a permanent mooring, and brand new shoreside facilities to complete the museum. The Battleship Texas Foundation hopes to have the ship in place and the museum open to the public in late 2026 or early 2027. When the new and improved USS Texas Museum reopens, it will join the Aircraft Carrier USS Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi as one of the must-visit spots for military history on the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "title": "After my divorce, my kids move between homes every week. Buying 2 of everything reduced their stress.",
    "description": "A divorced parent explains why she buys duplicate clothes and personal care items so her kids feel settled while moving between homes.",
    "fullText": "After my divorce, my kids started living out of bags, going back and forth between my home and their dad's each week.\n\nIt's been like this for five years, but this school year added something new to the shuffle. My son and daughter, now 11 and 13, suddenly became interested in styling their hair every morning. They wanted specific hair care products and personal care items of their own.\n\nSuddenly, we weren't just packing clothes, shoes, school bags, and sports equipment; we were also packing hair products, favorite shampoos, perfumes, colognes, and body washes. I love when my home and bathroom smell like my kids' favorite scents, but practically speaking, it felt ridiculous to schlep all of it back and forth every week.\n\nThis winter, I started buying two of the special items they love, making the back-and-forth easier and easing some of the stress that comes with not having small comforts.\n\nI bought duplicate shampoos my daughter loves, one for my house and one for her dad's. I found a smaller, on-sale bottle of the Replica perfume she's obsessed with, so she could keep it with her. My son is really into his hair products, and I've started stocking up on those, along with the body washes he likes. He wanted a Versace cologne, so I bought a full-size bottle for my home and a travel-size version for him to bring with him.\n\nMy kids are also at the age where a random zit can feel like a crisis, so I bought each of them an extra moisturizer to help with blemishes, plus an extra box of pimple patches they can share at their other home. In a way, I hope these products are helpful when I'm not there to offer advice. As a worrier, it brings me relief knowing they have what they need wherever they are.\n\nAs a divorced parent, I've remained the default for buying clothes, shoes, school supplies, and now personal care items. I pay attention to what makes my kids feel confident. I often ask myself, would I want to go a full week without my favorite shampoo or hair product? Knowing they have the things they love, even in smaller or travel-size versions, makes me feel better no matter whose week it is.\n\nOf course, not everything can be duplicated. My son has one pair of Apple headphones that goes back and forth. My daughter's iPad travels with her. They each have a phone. The clothes they love are packed into reusable bags every week, along with three or four pairs of shoes. In cooler months, sweaters and jackets get added to the pile.\n\nPacking up their lives is exhausting. Sometimes I pack for them even though they're capable, because I understand the emotional weight of the divorced-kid routine. I wouldn't want to do what they do every week: loading bags with clothes, shoes, sports equipment, backpacks, Chromebooks, and then living out of them.\n\nI could coordinate more with their dad or create shared shopping lists, but our relationship didn't end well, and I'd rather limit contact. What matters most is that my kids have what they need without worry.\n\nOnce the car is loaded, I always tell them I'll see them soon. We share a moment, maybe a joke, a memory, a compliment, or something to look forward to. Watching the other door close always hurts. My love for them rises straight to my eyes. I take a deep breath as I walk back to my car. I miss them immediately, but knowing they have the things that make them feel good while we're apart warms my heart.",

    "description": "A federal immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday. He was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital.",
    "fullText": "America's largest network of labor unions has condemned ICE after a federal agent on Saturday shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, which represents nearly 15 million workers, called Pretti's death \"senseless.\"\n\n\"As tens of thousands of Minnesotans made clear peacefully and powerfully yesterday, the Trump administration's horrific operation — and their actions aimed at stoking violence and chaos — must end,\" the labor group said in a statement.\n\n\"America's unions join the call for ICE to immediately leave Minnesota before anyone else is hurt or killed. We demand local authorities conduct a full, transparent investigation that will lead to accountability for this tragic and violent act, and for Congress to use its power to hold ICE accountable.\"\n\nA federal agent fatally shot Pretti in Minneapolis, where he worked as an ICU nurse at a US Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Minneapolis police confirmed on Saturday that Pretti is a US citizen. He had been filming the agents when the confrontation began.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Border Patrol and ICE, said Pretti was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and \"approached\" agents at the scene. The department said officers tried to disarm Pretti, but he resisted. In multiple videos of the incident, however, Pretti is never seen threatening agents and is disarmed and subdued before he is shot. Minneapolis police said Pretti had a permit to carry the weapon.\n\nThe DHS deployed ICE and other federal agents to Minnesota as part of an immigration enforcement sweep called Operation Metro Surge, which began in December. The department says it has deployed around 2,000 federal agents across the state to detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump has made securing the border and deporting those in the US who lack proper paperwork a central part of his administration's agenda.\n\nLocal residents and business owners, however, have criticized the tactics federal agents are using to find and detain those people, resulting in protests across the state. Tensions further escalated after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, on January 7.\n\nThe CEOs of Minnesota's largest businesses, including Target, Cargill, Allianz, and UnitedHealth, called for \"immediate de-escalation\" in a joint statement on Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham shared a statement calling for a \"full and transparent investigation\" into the recent shootings.\n\n\"'Operation Metro Surge' is not and has never been about enforcing immigration law. This is about a President who is angry with the people of Minnesota for disagreeing with his policies and is weaponizing the federal government against us in retribution,\" Burnham said.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing Pretti and other federal workers in the US, also criticized the Trump administration in a statement on Saturday. As an employee of the VA hospital, Pretti was a member of AFGE Local 3669.\n\n\"While details of the incident are still emerging, one fact is already clear: this tragedy did not happen in a vacuum. It is the direct result of an administration that has chosen reckless policy, inflammatory rhetoric, and manufactured crisis over responsible leadership and de-escalation,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in the statement.\n\nKelley said the presence of federal agents has stoked fear and division in the community.\n\n\"I urge everyone to remain disciplined and measured in public, even as we are rightly angry. Still, we must do what we can to maintain peace and calm,\" Kelley said. \"But do not mistake restraint for acceptance. Accountability will come, and AFGE will not be silent about the policies and decisions that led us here.\"",

    "fullText": "The CEOs of Minnesota's most prominent businesses are calling for local, state, and federal officials to find a solution as tensions skyrocket the day after federal agents shot and killed a second person in Minneapolis.\n\nA Border Patrol agent killed Alex Pretti, 37, a US citizen who worked as a nurse at the local Veterans Affairs hospital, on Saturday morning. Pretti had been filming federal immigration agents when the confrontation began.\n\nMinneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been the site of continuous protests since the Department of Homeland Security flooded the cities with immigration agents in December. Tensions have been especially high since an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good on January 7.\n\nThe Minnesota Chamber of Commerce distributed a letter on Sunday signed by more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies calling for \"de-escalation.\"\n\nAmong the signatories were the leaders of major corporations: Target CEO Michael Fiddelke, 3M CEO William Brown, Allianz Life Insurance Company CEO Jasmine Jirele, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening, and UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley, among many others.\n\nThe letter called for an \"immediate de-escalation of tensions\" and for state, local, and federal officials to \"work together to find real solutions.\"\n\n\"In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state, and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,\" the letter says.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's immigration policies have long been the subject of sharp debate among business and tech leaders, many of whom have sought to curry favor during the president's second term.\n\nSome tech leaders, in fact, were at the White House on Saturday night to attend a screening of the new documentary about Melania Trump, which was produced by Melania Trump. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy were both expected to attend, according to multiple reports.\n\nMeanwhile, some employees at those companies and others are calling on their bosses to speak out against ICE actions across the country.\n\nA petition with over 250 signatures, titled \"Tech demands ICE out of our cities,\" a group of employees is calling on tech leaders to \"pick up the phone\" and call the White House to demand ICE \"leave our cities.\" They are also demanding that their companies cancel any contracts they have with ICE. The bulk of the signatories said in the petition that they worked for Amazon and Google.\n\nAfter the latest fatal shooting in Minneapolis, some business and tech leaders themselves took to social media to say their piece.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund owner Bill Ackman called for calm while blaming Minnesota state officials for provoking the violence.\n\nJames Dyett, an exec at OpenAI, criticized the tech community for not speaking up. \"There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,\" Dyer wrote on X. \"Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.\"",

    "fullText": "Former Vice President Al Gore was characteristically calm yet blunt during a conversation with Bloomberg News about the global energy transition at a major gathering of world leaders this week.\n\nEach year, the World Economic Forum hosts world leaders, academics, scientists, and business executives in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThat event — dubbed simply \"Davos\" in the media — kicked off on Jan. 19 with the theme \"A Spirit of Dialogue\" for 2026.\n\nFinancial news outlet Bloomberg has long covered the annual forum in Davos, establishing \"Bloomberg House\" in 2024 for in-depth discussions, like its sit-down with the former vice president.\n\nGore has long been known for his ecological focus, and 2026 marked 20 years since the release of Gore's book and follow-up film, \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" Both warned that inaction on environmental issues would be costly and deadly.\n\nGore now chairs sustainable investment firm Generation Investment Management, and he was direct in his criticism of the United States' sharp turn away from the clean energy transition.\n\nPrivate equity firm chair and Bloomberg personality David Rubenstein spoke with Gore and asked why in-progress wind farm projects had been halted in the U.S., particularly amid soaring energy prices.\n\nGore, a staid, dutiful foil to his charismatic running mate, former President Bill Clinton, didn't pull punches about the inevitability of transitioning to renewable energy.\n\nHe told Rubenstein that renewables were \"taking over\" worldwide while the U.S. canceled projects nearing completion.\n\n\"We really don't have any choice about this,\" Gore said of the global future of energy, a sentiment that echoed a recent statement by International Renewable Energy Agency director-general Francesco La Camera.\n\nShould the U.S. invest \n\nIt should be private investments\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIn a Jan. 18 report ahead of Davos, Bloomberg reported that the WEF had agreed to \"downplay\" discussion of rising temperatures and other topics considered agitating to the federal government in an effort to secure American participation.\n\nHowever, as Davos convened in Switzerland, political discourse in the U.S. was heavily focused on the cost of basic energy necessities, such as heat and electricity.\n\nActive lawmakers and candidates were often forced to discuss the issue through a lens of current policy or constituent outrage, whereas Gore was under no such constraints.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Gore emphasized that solar and wind were the \"cheapest forms of electricity\" today, an accurate statement that was also consequential as a large share of American homes struggled to afford utilities.\n\nSolar and wind are also widely confirmed to be faster to build than another popular carbon-pollution-reducing solution, nuclear — and even if land acquisition can sometimes be more straightforward for nuclear, the impact on the neighboring towns, including emergency protocols, is far more serious for nuclear than renewable development.\n\nIn November, lawmakers issued an urgent plea to utility providers as more households fell behind and faced shutoffs, and as data center expansion continued to spike costs.\n\nGore's assertion that the U.S. couldn't opt out of the clean energy transition was bolstered by some recent news on that front.\n\nIn January, a district court judge ruled that the federal government acted unlawfully in canceling nearly $8 billion in clean energy projects.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "One week ago, Destiny Jackson spoke with CNN about her family of eight getting tear gassed in Minneapolis while stopped on their way home from her son’s basketball game on January 14.\n\nThe family says they did not realize an anti-ICE protest was happening around them when they first reached the scene. Video from the scene showed her children rushing out of the car and into a nearby house for safety, on the same night a federal agent shot a man in the leg.\n\nIt was one of several interviews Jackson had done that week with different news outlets. Someone asked her to make a GoFundMe, so she did, she said — and donations poured in, raising more than $170,000 in all.\n\nSince then, Jackson tells CNN she has faced online attacks by far-right social media users and select media publications.\n\nThat’s partly because, since CNN published the story, a one-hour-and-36-minute livestream from that evening has surfaced, which was first reported by Crime Watch Mpls and then covered by the Daily Mail, that shows Jackson at the actual protest itself without her children – at one point, making an inflammatory comment on camera.\n\nBut that’s also because Jackson has a past criminal record.\n\nIn two interviews with CNN on January 23 and 24, Jackson explained more about why she was seen at the protest in the livestream and addressed her previous criminal charges.\n\nIn her January 17 interview with CNN, Jackson said she had retrieved her mother from the protest before getting back into her vehicle with her six kids and husband to leave the area.\n\nThat’s when she says she heard commotion from the protest and told her husband to drive away, but said they were blocked in and couldn’t get out. From there, a tear gas canister rolled under her car and exploded.\n\nIn the newly surfaced video, she and her husband appear in and out of frame at or near the protest for at least 45 minutes.\n\nJackson explained she and her husband were driving home from her son’s basketball game when they noticed the road ahead was blocked off. Cars were coming from every direction, while some cars were parked on the street, so they pulled over to allow cars to pass, she said.\n\nHer husband wanted to know what was happening, so he got out of the car to ask around. From the passenger seat, Jackson says she coincidentally noticed her mother, her mother’s boyfriend and a family friend crossing the street. She called out to them and they came to talk to her, explaining they were headed to a protest.\n\nShortly after, her family friend came back to the car because it was too cold. At that point, Jackson said she didn’t want her mom to be at the protest because she was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure, so she walked to the protest to try to get her mother to leave. Her family friend, whom she refers to as “auntie,” stayed in the car to watch Jackson’s children.\n\nJackson said she was trying to get her mom to leave the entire time she was at the demonstration, but added she also talked to people while she was there. Her husband is just “nosy,” and wanted to see what was happening, she said.\n\nIn recent interviews with CNN, she explained she had been able to leave before the situation turned heated, but she had not wanted to because she was focused on her mother. It was when the situation escalated that her family’s vehicle became trapped and they couldn’t get out of the area, Jackson said.\n\nAlthough CNN cannot independently confirm that Jackson’s vehicle was trapped when the protest escalated, Minnesota Attorney General Ellison previously told CNN the family was “caught in the middle of” the situation.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin also said in an email to CNN on January 16: “This family was the victim of rioters and agitators whose lawless behavior is encouraged by Minnesota’s top leaders.”\n\nAbout 10 minutes before the livestream captured what appears to be flash bangs going off, Jackson is seen in the video talking to a friend in a car, away from the demonstration.\n\nThe livestreamer comes up to the two of them, and in response to a prompt from the livestreamer, Jackson says: “We’re going to kill these motherf**kers.”\n\nThe livestreamer responds: “No you not, no she not.”\n\nIt’s unclear, from the video alone, what Jackson meant.\n\n“Shooting and killing people is unacceptable, that was completely taken out of context,” Jackson said to CNN.\n\nShe explained the livestreamer had been talking about guns and weapons, so she claims she was sarcastically asking him if he was going to kill federal agents.\n\n“I was like sarcastically asking him that … I wasn’t saying we’re going to like, that we were gonna kill ICE, no,” she said.\n\nAbout three minutes after Jackson’s comment in the livestream, her husband is seen standing in a crowd of protesters who were chanting, “Pigs, go home.” He is not seen chanting with the protesters in the livestream.\n\nA few minutes later, what appear to be flash-bang devices start to go off and the crowd disperses.\n\nJackson is seen in the passenger seat of her car a few minutes later, recording on her phone. A few seconds later, it appears that a tear gas canister goes off near her vehicle.\n\nJackson tells CNN that they couldn’t move their car once the demonstration near them escalated.\n\nA tear gas canister rolled under the family’s car and exploded underneath it, she said. Bystanders helped her get her children out of the car, with her 6-month-old being the last to make it out.\n\nShe said she gave the baby mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while people poured milk on her other children’s eyes because of the tear gas.\n\nJackson said she went to the hospital with her baby and two of her children, who have severe asthma.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis said in a statement the tear gas caused “a 6-month-old infant inside the vehicle to experience breathing difficulties,” according to initial reports.\n\nWhen police and the fire department were able to reach the family, “the infant was breathing and stable, but (in) serious condition,” according to the statement.\n\nAs of Saturday, Jackson and her baby are still dealing with congestion from the tear gas, she said, with her baby taking medication to clear his airways.\n\nCritics are upset that Jackson is collecting money on a GoFundMe after getting tear gassed given her criminal record, she tells CNN.\n\nCourt records show Jackson agreed to plead guilty to “aiding an offender – accomplice after the fact” in June 2021. In the same case, she was also charged with murder, but the charges were later dismissed, according to a court document.\n\nJames Moore, who Jackson says was her boyfriend at the time, was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to intentional second-degree murder in 2020, according to a Hennepin County Attorney’s Office statement.\n\nMoore fatally shot a man who was lured to an apartment to sell marijuana in an apparent robbery gone wrong, the statement says. Moore and another man ran into Jackson’s apartment after the shooting.\n\nA witness said it was Jackson who lured the man by creating a fake Facebook message, according to the statement and a criminal complaint. From there, Moore and another man “had devised a plan to rob (the victim) when he arrived,” the prosecutor’s statement says.\n\nHowever, Jackson was only convicted of “aiding an offender – accomplice after the fact.”\n\n“I had nothing to do with anybody being killed,” Jackson tells CNN, explaining that the accomplice after-the-fact charge was based on the fact that the men fled to her apartment after the killing. Jackson also claims she was not the person to write the Facebook message, explaining she gave her boyfriend access to her account.\n\n“Now that (I’m) an adult and all that stuff, like we don’t share our passwords and stuff with people,” she said.\n\nShe was sentenced to 28 days in jail, which she had already served at the time, and five years of probation, according to court records. She tells CNN she has a few months left of her probation.\n\nShe believes if she had never made a GoFundMe, she doesn’t think so much “negativity” about her story would have surfaced.\n\n“What happened to us was traumatic, you know, in our mind, we feel so guilty … yes, I probably should have left sooner than we did,” she said. “It’s very traumatizing, like the things that we went through and the things that people are saying.”",

    "title": "6 Types of Retirement Income That Won’t Get Taxed",
    "description": "While there are many surprisingly hidden costs in your tax years during retirement, several types of retirement income aren't taxable.",
    "fullText": "One of the most overlooked aspects of retirement planning is the effect that federal income taxes or state income taxes have on someone trying to live on a fixed income. They can take a big bite out of your retirement savings if you’re not prepared.\n\nThe good news for your nest egg is that not all retirement income is taxable. By understanding which sources of income are tax-free in 2026, you can create a smarter retirement strategy and keep more of your hard-earned money. Here are six types of retirement income that won’t get taxed, and how to make the most of them.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid taxes on your retirement money is to use a Roth account. Both IRA and 401(k) plans can be structured as Roth accounts, which don’t offer a tax deduction on contributions but allow tax-free withdrawals after age 59 ½.\n\nEssentially, with a Roth account, you’re paying your taxes upfront at the time that you contribute, rather than owing them on your distributions. While you can’t contribute to a Roth if your income exceeds certain levels, you can convert your traditional plan to a Roth at any time. However, you’ll have to pay income taxes on the amount of the conversion, just as if you withdrew the money.\n\nTrending Now: Here’s What Retirees Wasted the Most Money On in 2025 — and How To Avoid It in 2026\n\nUp Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nFor this reason, it typically makes more sense to start a Roth earlier in your career rather than facing a huge tax bill during your peak earning years. For example, a $1 million portfolio in a 401(k) plan or traditional IRA might be worth $800,000 or less after taxes. Similarly, if your investments are in a regular, taxable brokerage account, the income that money generates may also be taxable.\n\nIt’s not usually a good idea to rely on an inheritance as a retirement plan. For starters, receiving an inheritance is never a sure thing, and additionally, the amount bequeathed is rarely enough to fund a long retirement.\n\nHowever, many Americans do receive an inheritance at some point in their lives, and it can often be a good supplement to existing retirement savings. Financially speaking, the best part of an inheritance is that it is tax-free, so long as you don’t live in Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which still impose inheritance taxes.\n\nThough some states do impose an estate tax, that money will come out of the inheritance and not your personal funds.\n\nMunicipal bonds are issued by states, cities and various localities, generally to fund projects like schools, roads and other items that are for the common good. Municipal bonds are granted tax relief at the federal level, meaning investors don’t have to pay federal taxes on the interest earned from any municipal bond.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Ca.) declared Sunday he’s “not giving ICE or Border Patrol another dime given how these agencies are operating” as deadly sweeping Immigration and Custom Enforcement raids led by the Trump administration have sparked political and public backlash.\n\nAppearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Schiff made the statement after moderator Kristen Welker asked him if he’s “prepared to vote against Department of Homeland Security funding if it means partially shutting down the government, again, coming on the heels of an incredibly long shutdown.”\n\nPolitics: Democrats Consider Partial Government Shutdown To Curb ICE\n\nTelling Welker straight up that “Democrats are not going to fund that,” he continued, “The government will shut down if Republicans insist that that be joined with other government funding. It will be a Republican decision. They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”\n\nThe California senator noted Democrats are hoping “some of the Republicans in the Senate may see those scenes in the streets and be as repelled as we are, and vote against that continuation of violence also.”\n\nHe added: “If they don’t, it will be their decision whether they couple that funding for these ICE agents and Border Patrol agents with all these other government agencies.”\n\n“[Republicans] will make the decision. They’re in the majority if they want to shut down the government so they can perpetuate this violence,” Schiff said.\n\nPolitics: Sworn Witness Accounts Of Alex Pretti Killing Differ Sharply From DHS\n\nSchiff went on to vow he’s “not going to be a part of it.”\n\n“And I think anyone who votes to give them more money to do this will share in the responsibility and see more Americans die in our cities as a result.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker asked Schiff what the “exact impact” would be if legislators withhold funding now, considering “Republicans have already passed $170 billion in extra DHS funding through what they’ve dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Well, it would certainly, I hope, stop it from becoming even worse,” he responded. “They have thrown so much money at these agencies. They don’t know what to do with it. And there is no question that when we actually get a chance to do oversight again, which I hope will happen after this November, you are going to find all kinds of corruption [with] how that money is going out.”\n\nPolitics: House Passes Bill Funding ICE — With Help From Democrats\n\nSchiff then told Welker he believes they will find that the money has been “wasted hand over fist.”\n\n“There is going to be enormous waste, fraud and abuse in DHS given how money is being spent without any kind of real oversight,” he said.\n\nWatch Schiff’s interview on “Meet the Press” below.\n\nTrump Takes Aim At ‘Corrupt’ Adam Schiff As Next Target In His Political Retribution Tour\n\nAdam Schiff Calls Out Trump For 'Flip-Flopping' On Abortion\n\nRep.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities unveiled a new mural on a giant billboard in a central Tehran square on Sunday with a direct warning to the United States to not attempt a military strike on the country, as U.S. warships head to the region.\n\nThe image shows a bird's-eye view of an aircraft carrier with damaged and exploding fighter planes on its flight deck. The deck is strewn with bodies and streaked with blood that trails into the water behind the ship to form a pattern reminiscent of the stripes of the American flag. A slogan is emblazoned across one corner: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.”\n\nThe unveiling of the mural in Enghelab Square comes as the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and accompanying warships move toward the region. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action.\n\n“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction and maybe we won’t have to use it,” Trump said Thursday.\n\nEnghelab Square is used for gatherings called by the state and authorities change its mural based on national occasions. On Saturday, the commander of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard warned that his force is “more ready than ever, finger on the trigger.”\n\nTension between the U.S. and Iran has spiked in the wake of a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that saw thousands of people killed and tens of thousands arrested. Trump had threatened military action if Iran continued to kill peaceful protesters or carried out mass executions of those detained.\n\nThere have been no further protests for days and Trump claimed recently that Tehran had halted the planned execution of about 800 arrested protesters — a claim Iran’s top prosecutor called “completely false.”\n\nBut Trump has indicated he is keeping his options open, saying on Thursday that any military action would make last June’s U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites “look like peanuts.”\n\nU.S. Central Command said on social media that its Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle now has a presence in the Middle East, noting the fighter jet “enhances combat readiness and promotes regional security and stability.”\n\nSimilarly, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Thursday that it deployed its Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar “in a defensive capacity.”\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, which does not tolerate dissent.\n\nThe death toll reported by activists has continued to rise since the end of the demonstrations, as information trickles out despite a more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in Iran’s history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Sunday put the death toll at 5,848, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,280 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "description": "Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin says he thinks Franklin County has never seen a real level 3 snow emergency before.",
    "fullText": "Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin said the level 3 snow emergency declared Jan. 25 appears to be the first in the county's history, and it could continue into Jan. 26.\n\nBaldwin told The Dispatch that the roads in Franklin County are closed to all except emergency personnel and people who must travel for essential work, including hospital and airport employees.\n\nOngoing extreme cold temperatures will make road treatments less effective, so it's possible the level 3 snow emergency could remain in place for a while, Baldwin said.\n\n\"The roads are white,\" Baldwin said in an interview with the Dispatch at 12:30 p.m. Jan. 25. \"They're totally snow covered. Some of the roads are not bad ... Some are just absolutely horrible.\"\n\nBaldwin's office later issued a press release clarifying the level 3 status.\n\n\"This is not an automatic enforcement action in which drivers are stopped and cited simply for being onthe road,\" the release said. \"Deputies and police officers use discretion when encountering motorists. Those who have a legitimate and necessary reason to travel should not fear immediate citation or arrest. However, individuals traveling without an acceptable reason during a Level 3 Snow Emergency may be subject to arrest.\"\n\nBaldwin said he doesn't believe a level 3 snow emergency has been called in Franklin County before. He said this is because Franklin County has \"so many resources\" and is usually able to clear roads quickly.\n\nThe sheriff's office later clarified that in the early 2000s, former Sheriff Jim Karnes accidentally declared a level 3 emergency due to a miscommunication.\n\nBaldwin placed the county under a level 3 snow emergency at 11:37 a.m. Jan 25. Snow emergencies are set by local sheriffs and remain in place until they are lifted.\n\nBaldwin said he will lift the emergency when he has heard from the Ohio Department of Transportation and the city that the roads are safe.\n\nBaldwin said he was out driving on the roads the morning of Jan. 25. As noon approached, he saw more and more regular vehicles out, and some of them were struggling in the snow.\n\n\"If the regular motorists can't get by, then the snowplows can't get by,\" Baldwin said. \"If they can't get by, the fire trucks, our cruisers can't respond.\"\n\nBaldwin said the level 3 snow emergency will remain in place until the main roads in the county are cleared. It's difficult to say how long that will take because snow is still coming down, he added. The National Weather Service forecasts snow into the night, with flurries still possible after 10 p.m.\n\n\"If we're just able to stay off of the road and let the snowplows do their job, then we can all get back on the road quicker,\" Baldwin said.\n\nBaldwin said the main purpose of the snow emergency is to keep people off the roads who do not need to be traveling. He hopes central Ohioans heed the emergency's warning.\n\n\"The main message is to keep people safe. Just stay home and enjoy the day,\" Baldwin said.\n\nPublic Safety and Breaking News Reporter Bailey Gallion can be reached at bagallion@dispatch.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Is it legal to drive during level 3 snow emergency in Franklin County?",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is calling for the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, saying that she believes Noem is attempting to \"mislead the American public” about the fatal shooting of a 37 year-old protester in Minneapolis.\n\nThe call from Rosen, a moderate from Nevada who was part of the group that helped Republicans end the 43-day government shutdown last year, comes amid a growing fury from congressional Democrats who have also vowed to block funding for the Homeland Security Department. A House resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against Noem has the support of more than 100 Democrats, but few Senate Democrats have so far weighed in.\n\n“Kristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year — and the abuses of power we’re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Rosen said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nRosen said Noem's conduct is “deeply shameful” and she \"must be impeached and removed from office immediately.”\n\nImpeachment proceedings are unlikely in the GOP-controlled Congress, but mounting Democratic outrage over the violence in the streets of Minneapolis is certain to disrupt Senate Republican leaders’ hopes this week to quickly approve a wide-ranging spending bill and avoid a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30.\n\nAnd while some moderate Democrats have been wary over the last year of criticizing the Trump administration on border and immigration issues, the fatal shootings in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7 have transformed the debate, even among moderates like Rosen.\n\nThe senator's call for impeachment followed Noem’s quick defense, without a full investigation, of the fatal shooting of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti as he “approached” them with a gun. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but he appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos.\n\nDuring the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and opened fire with several shots, including into his back. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon.\n\nNoem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”\n\n“This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” Noem said Sunday.\n\nIn her call for Noem's impeachment, Rosen cited other issues beyond the current ICE operations. She said Noem has also “violated the public trust by wasting millions in taxpayer dollars” on self promotion and cited reports that the Coast Guard purchased her two luxury jets worth $172 million.\n\nRosen’s statement follows that of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is one of the more left-leaning members of the Senate Democratic caucus. Markey said last week that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against Noem, “who is right now actually orchestrating on the streets of our country this almost vigilantism on the part of ICE agents terrorizing cities all across the country.”\n\nAnd while other senators stopped short of calling for Noem's impeachment, several moderate Democrats who joined Rosen in voting to reopen the government last year said they would vote against Homeland Security funding this week even if it meant a government shutdown.\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that DHS is “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said that “we are not living in normal times.”\n\nAs administration officials immediately defended the shooting, several Republicans have called for a thorough investigation, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.\n\nHouse Democrats increasingly back Noem's impeachment\n\nCalls for Noem’s impeachment also grew louder in the House as the Democratic caucus had a phone call with Minnesota’s Gov. Tim Walz and the state’s Attorney General Keith Ellison, both former congressmen, according to a person familiar with the private call who requested anonymity to discuss it.\n\nMost of the House Democratic lawmakers who spoke during the meeting called for Noem's impeachment, said another person familiar with the call who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.\n\nNew York Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat who was one of only seven House Democrats who voted to fund the Homeland Security Department last week, said Sunday that “there must be accountability, which is why Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately.”\n\n“She is not focused on safety or border security; she’s focused on chaos and self-promotion, undermining local law enforcement and stoking violence as a result,” Gillen said in a post on X.\n\nAP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

I saw a lot of positives, but when you are losing 3-1 and have not won for 11 games then it's completely right to say, 'where are the results?'\n\n\"That's what we have to get. It is up to us to find these puzzle pieces. There's no magician. I always believe in this group, these players, that we will turn it around.\"\n\nDespite Palace's poor form, they are still one point better off than at this stage last season and can book a spot in the last 16 of the Conference League if they come through a two-legged play-off against Zrinjski Mostar from Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n\"These are tough moments, tough games,\" added Glasner.\n\n\"I look at the team and 3-0 down, a red card, you can go out five or six-nil, but we came back, scored a goal and made a fight of it, so that shows the great character of the group and that gives me a lot of confidence this group will turn it around.\"",

    "fullText": "This was a very different matchday experience for Bruno Guimaraes.\n\nInstead of being involved in the thick of it on the field, the injured Newcastle United captain could only watch on helplessly from the stands alongside his family at St James' Park on Sunday.\n\nIt's not something he will necessarily want to relive anytime soon after his side fell to a 2-0 defeat against Aston Villa.\n\n\"Tough not being on the pitch with my team-mates,\" he wrote on Instagram afterwards.\n\nThere was a reason the coaching staff were prepared to give the Brazilian every chance to prove his fitness after he hobbled off with an ankle injury in the win against PSV Eindhoven in midweek.\n\nRemarkably, since his Premier League debut nearly four years ago, Newcastle have not won any of the nine league games Guimaraes has missed.\n\nFrom the 27 points on offer, Newcastle have claimed just five without their talisman.\n\n\"You lose a lot when a player like that isn't available,\" head coach Eddie Howe said after the game.\n\n\"But we can't rely on one player. We do have to find a way of winning without him.\"",

    "fullText": "When Tomas Cvancara stretched his neck and planted a header on Craig Gordon's crossbar an hour into this exhilarating clash of the champions and the wannabe champions, a sense of shock swept around Tynecastle.\n\nCvancara? Was he still out there? You could have been forgiven for thinking not. For an hour he'd been little more than a keen if ill-fitting presence in the Celtic attack.\n\nHis lack of goal threat was hardly a surprise given he has scored just three times in the 43 games he had played before this one. His lack of impact was no great sensation either given he hadn't played a competitive minute since late November.\n\nThe fact he was still on the pitch was a little odd because the game had passed him by, but that header showed there was life in the new boy.\n\nMore life than Hearts had bargained for. Minutes later, he tore away down the left, leaving Craig Halkett trailing behind. His delivery to Yang Hyun-jun was precise and against the flow of the game Celtic were back in front.\n\nTynecastle rubbed its eyes and then girded its loins. In those seconds, a compelling game became a total belter; thrilling, controversial, exhausting and invigorating.\n\nGoals, aggravation, a red card that infuriated the visitors and opened a door for the hosts, a toe-to-toe fight that went to the wire.\n\nIt wasn't so much the bitter cold that caused the shivers at Tynecastle, it was the mad drama of the clash, the intensity and edge-of-the-seat fury of it all.",

Since then, both clubs have been relegated to and returned from the Championship - and this term both are chasing European glory.\n\nNewcastle are seventh in the league phase of the Champions League. Villa have already secured a place in the Europa League last 16.\n\nHowever, after losing by an aggregate score of 12-1 on their past three trips to St James' Park, Villa's 2-0 success this time around underlined the progress made under boss Unai Emery.\n\nThe result keeps Villa, who bounced back from last Sunday's loss to Everton by adding this win to Thursday's Europa League victory away to Fenerbahce, third in the table and firmly in the title race, just four points behind leaders Arsenal.\n\nAnd Emery was insistent that his players had delivered a \"complete\" performance.\n\n\"The players were extraordinary,\" the Spaniard told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"We spoke about this match and the difficulties some teams have with their level here. It is the highest level we can face this season and the players respond fantastic.\n\n\"We can only help the players tactically. Out on the field, they need to show the attitude and commitment to work to the gameplan and they did it.\n\n\"Last week we lost and were so disappointed but we can be calm again and have confidence.

    "fullText": "Michael Carrick is far too experienced to get coaxed into giving away whether he wants to become Manchester United's next permanent manager.\n\nHe is happier revealing his kids were in the away section at Emirates Stadium, joining the throng in a bout of unbridled glee when Matheus Cunha scored United's brilliant third and then again when the whistle went to confirm a 3-2 victory, their first win at Arsenal in eight years.\n\nWe cannot know whether Carrick's two children were among those still singing in Carrick's honour 15 minutes after the final whistle. But given the collective noise being made by the 3,000-strong visiting support, they probably were.\n\nMinority United owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe looked pleased enough in the directors' box. There have not been many moments to smile about in the two years he has been running the football side at Old Trafford. This certainly was one.\n\nUnited have marked Carrick's first two matches in charge with successive wins. It was something Ruben Amorim managed once in his 14-month tenure - as part of a run of three successes earlier this season that earned him the October manager of the month award.\n\nUnited have amassed six points under Carrick. It took Amorim five games to get to seven - and he lost the next three matches.\n\nUnited have taken twice as many points from their past two games - against the teams first and second in the table - as they collected from the three before that, against Leeds, Wolves and Burnley, three of the current bottom five.\n\nSix weeks ago, hardly anyone would have chosen Carrick as United's next manager in preference to Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner.",

    "fullText": "Ted Cruz trashed President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in conversations with GOP donors last year, explosive leaked recordings allege.\n\nThe Texas senator, expected to run for president in 2028, slammed Trump’s tariff crusade and said he even threatened his staff with immediate firing if they used the phrase “Liberation Day” to refer to the day the sweeping taxes were announced, reports Axios.\n\nCruz, 55, told donors he and other senators expressed their tariff disgust with Trump in a lengthy phone call, warning it would tank the economy and lead to his impeachment. The call pushed past midnight and “did not go well,” Cruz told donors, with Trump “yelling” and “cursing” at the lawmakers.\n\nCruz claims that he received an especially explicit response from the president that night.\n\n“Mr. President, if we get to November of [2026] and people’s 401(k)s are down 30% and prices are up 10–20% at the supermarket, we’re going to go into Election Day, face a bloodbath,” Cruz told Trump, according to the recording. “You’re going to lose the House, you’re going to lose the Senate, you’re going to spend the next two years being impeached every single week.”\n\nTrump allegedly responded bluntly: “‘F--- you, Ted.’”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCruz’s office did not deny the contents of the recordings in a statement to Axios. Still, Cruz’s office claimed that he is still “the president’s greatest ally in the Senate and battles every day in the trenches to advance his agenda.”\n\nAxios reports that the recordings were “nearly 10 minutes in total” and came from conversations in “early and middle 2025.” The site said the recordings were provided by a “Republican source.”\n\nIt is unclear which donors Cruz was speaking to.\n\nTrump referred to Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and even went as far as suggesting that his wife, Heidi, is ugly compared to Melania. Still, Cruz has largely done Trump’s bidding in the Senate ever since, and he even campaigned for him in 2024.\n\nCruz, 55, is now believed to be eyeing another White House run, hoping to become a more traditional GOP successor to Trumpism. Standing in his way is the 41-year-old Vance, who is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination in the eyes of prediction markets.\n\nVance was “torched” by Cruz in the secret recordings, Axios reported. Sources also told The Washington Post last month that Cruz privately badmouths the VP to donors.\n\nIn the recordings obtained by Axios, Cruz claimed that Vance was a “pawn of conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson,” who is among Cruz’s biggest foes, having clashed with the ex-Fox News host in an explosive interview last summer over the Trump administration’s strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Cruz supported the intervention and has repeatedly criticized Carlson for his opposition to U.S. military support of Israel.\n\n“Tucker created JD,” Cruz told donors, according to Axios. “JD is Tucker’s protégé, and they are one and the same.”\n\nPublicly, Cruz has never explicitly linked Vance and Carlson. He alleged to donors that the ousted National Security Adviser Mike Waltz—of Signalgate infamy—was pushed out of Trump’s Cabinet by Carlson and Vance.\n\n“[He] supported being vigorous against Iran and bombing Iran—and Tucker and JD took Mike out,” Cruz said, according to Axios.\n\nCarlson told Axios he had nothing to do with the high-profile ouster.",

    "fullText": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that a U.S. security guarantees document for Ukraine is “100% ready” after two days of talks involving representatives from Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Vilnius during a visit to Lithuania, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is waiting for its partners to set a signing date, after which the document would go to the U.S. Congress and Ukrainian parliament for ratification.\n\nZelenskyy also emphasized Ukraine’s push for European Union membership by 2027, calling it an “economic security guarantee.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader described the talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as likely the first trilateral format in “quite a long while” that included not only diplomats but military representatives from all three sides. The talks, which began on Friday and continued Saturday, were the latest aiming to end Russia’s nearly four-year full-scale invasion.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged fundamental differences between Ukrainian and Russian positions, reaffirming territorial issues as a major sticking point.\n\n“Our position regarding our territory — Ukraine’s territorial integrity — must be respected,” he said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed a Ukraine settlement with U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner during marathon talks late Thursday. The Kremlin insisted that to reach a peace deal, Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the areas in the east that Russia illegally annexed but has not fully captured.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. is trying to find a compromise, but that “all sides must be ready for compromise.”\n\nNegotiators will return to the UAE on Feb. 1 for the next round of talks, according to a U.S. official. The recent talks covered a broad range of military and economic matters and included the possibility of a ceasefire before a deal, the official said. There was not yet an agreement on a final framework for oversight and operation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russia and is the largest in Europe.",

    "fullText": "Even though companies always want to avoid costly recalls, they are an unavoidable reality. There are now certain models of Toyota Tundra trucks that have become the subject of a nationwide safety recall that drivers should be aware of.\n\nOn January 23, 2026, the Toyota Newsroom website revealed that there was a voluntary safety recall for certain Tundra and Tundra Hybrid 2024 and 2025 models. The company stated that approximately 162,000 vehicles in the United States will be affected. Owners are set to be notified of the recall by late March 2026. The announcement included the following description of the issue that necessitated a fix.\n\n\"Under certain circumstances, the multimedia display may become stuck on a camera view or display a black image in the subject vehicles. If this occurs, the rearview image may not be displayed while the vehicle is being reversed. In this case, the vehicle may not meet a federal safety standard, and there can be an increased risk of a crash with a person behind the vehicle.\"\n\nFortunately for owners, the company described a simple fix that will be provided at no charge. \"For all involved vehicles, dealers will update the Parking Assist ECU software, free of charge.\"\n\nIn the automotive industry, there is very little that is as important as being reliable. On December 4, 2025, Consumer Reports published the findings of its 2026 Automotive Brand Report Card, which named Toyota as the most reliable brand overall. The consumer advocate company's website described the methodology they used to conclude that Toyota should get the highest rank.\n\n“The latest Consumer Reports Annual Auto Reliability Surveys gathered information from car owners on about 380,000 vehicles from model years 2000 to 2025 and early 2026. The survey covers up to 20 problem areas, including engine, electric motors, transmission, in-car electronics, and more. CR’s team of statisticians, researchers, and testers analyzed trouble areas and created an overall reliability score for each model and year. Serious problem areas that can lead to expensive repairs are more heavily weighted. Reliability predictions for 2026 models are based on each model’s overall reliability for the past three years, provided that the model hasn’t been redesigned during that time. If there is insufficient data on a model in any given model year, CR uses the brand reliability score to supplement that model’s new car prediction. The survey gathered information from car owners each year about problems they had with their vehicles in the past 12 months.”",

    "fullText": "The unshakeable influence of the Kardashians over the past decade has led to a rise in women trying to achieve the perfect, round derrière. But strong buttocks aren’t just an aesthetic goal – they have now also been recognised as an important indicator of our overall health.\n\n“The gluteus maximus is the powerhouse of all human movement,” says Dr Marjola Thanaj, a research fellow at the University of Westminster. “It’s a key trait that sets us apart from other primates.”\n\nA new study, led by Dr Thanaj, has revealed that the shape of the gluteus maximus muscles, found deep in our buttocks, can offer an early warning sign of the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nA team of researchers at the University of Westminster used more than 60,000 MRI scans, collected by the UK Biobank project, to study the shifts in the muscles caused by age, lifestyle and the onset of disease. These were combined with lifestyle and health data for each individual.\n\nThe results showed that the muscles of men and women changed in markedly different ways, as each gender edged closer to developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn men, there was a thinning of the gluteus maximus in specific regions – in some areas by as much as a quarter – giving it a more hollowed profile on scans. By contrast, the muscle appeared larger in women – deceptively, as this change was actually caused by fat infiltrating the muscle.\n\n“The findings suggest the gluteus maximus is a good indicator of metabolic health,” says Dr Thanaj.\n\nIt’s possible to spot clues in different bottom shapes that are likely to reflect the underlying health and function of the gluteus maximus muscle. Here are five common shapes and what they signify.\n\nWith fat evenly distributed in the upper and lower part of the buttocks, this shape is seen as highly desirable in women, reflected in the popularity of the “Brazilian bum lift”. In men, it is often associated with fitness and virility.\n\n“A round bottom could indicate good glute muscle mass and a good distribution of muscle and fat around the whole of the glutes,” says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in physiology at the University of Essex’s School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences. “Because the bottom is more filled out, this could mean there is more muscle, which means more strength and stability.”\n\n“People with round bottoms are likely to have good lower body strength,” agrees Kate Rowe-Ham, a personal trainer and the author of the health and fitness book for midlife women, Owning Your Menopause. “They might be doing activities such as lifting weights, sprinting and climbing.”\n\nFullest at the bottom and tapering in near the waistline, this shape – most commonly seen in women – is also associated with health.\n\n“Women often dislike being pear-shaped, which means they have a tendency to hold their fat around their bottom and thighs, but it’s far healthier than carrying fat in the middle of your body, around your organs,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nOverall size and tone matters, but if the buttocks are pert, rather than saggy, it’s a good sign. “This shape is a sign of better metabolic health compared to most of the others, showing strong mid-to-lower glutes and thighs,” says Dr Chung.\n\nThis shape has more mass in the upper portion of the bottom, with very little where it meets the thighs. It is common in post-menopausal women due to hormonal changes.\n\n“As women age and lose muscle, fat distribution can also shift from the bottom and thighs to the abdomen,” says Rowe-Ham. “They can find fat gathering around the hips and top of their bottom, creating ‘love handles’.”\n\nThis shape, which lacks volume, suggests weaker lower glutes and thighs, says Dr Chung.\n\nFlat across the hips and glutes, lacking fullness at either the top or lower part of the gluteus maximus, this shape can be seen in men or women – although it’s generally more pronounced in men due to their lack of hormone-driven fat around their hips and buttocks.\n\nIt often suggests a tendency to store fat around the middle or love handles, and can also imply reduced gluteal muscle volume or activity. “If that’s the case, it could result in lower overall lower-body strength, reduced hip and trunk stability and an increased load on the lower back and knees,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nBoth men and women tend to lose mass in their gluteus maximus, along with skin elasticity and firmness, as they age. Flatter, saggier bottoms that have a deflated look are common, regardless of people’s weight. “I often see this even in very slim people,” says Rowe-Ham. “They might look great in clothes, but if they’re not exercising to maintain muscle mass they’re not future-proofing their bodies.”\n\n“Flat bottoms tend to mean weaker glutes, which can lead to issues such as back, knee or hip pain,” says Dr Chung. Poor posture, reduced mobility and lower strength are also potential issues.\n\nAs the largest muscle in the body, the gluteus maximus drives forward propulsion, stabilises the pelvis and trunk and enables us to walk, run, climb and rise from a seated to a standing position with efficiency and control.\n\nIt also plays a major role in how well we process and use energy – if we’re not doing so efficiently, it can lead to conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and cardiovascular disease.\n\n“Large muscles, like the gluteus, act almost like ‘engines’ of the body,” explains Dr Thanaj. “The healthier and stronger these muscles are, the better the body can manage blood sugar, store and burn fuel and support healthy ageing.”\n\nAlthough the new study suggested that Type 2 diabetes triggers different responses in men and women to the structure of their gluteus maximus, in both cases, there was a reduction of healthy muscle tissue.\n\nDr Chung explains that maintaining muscle in our bottoms is particularly important, as it is the main site for glucose uptake in the body. “More muscle means more glucose being absorbed and stored, which then lowers blood sugar levels,” he says.\n\n“Increasing muscle also increases resting metabolic rate – the calories burnt at rest – whereas having more fat does the opposite and decreases metabolic efficiency.”\n\nHe adds that this area of the body is also “massively linked with bodily movement and longevity – more muscle means slower ageing and the ability to keep lifting things, walking upstairs, balancing and much more for longer”.\n\nSeveral factors affect the shape and size of our bottoms, including our overall weight, which is influenced by the calories we consume and the amount of exercise we do.\n\n“Genetics, pelvic width, hip bone shape and where a person stores fat also play a huge role,” says Dr Chung. Women are biologically predisposed to store more fat around the hips and buttocks to support fertility, pregnancy and lactation, while men tend to have a higher proportion of lean muscle in the gluteal region, due to testosterone, strength and propulsion.\n\nMost of the fat we can see in this area will be subcutaneous, which is far less harmful than visceral fat found around the organs, linked to a higher risk of conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke and certain cancers.\n\n“However, intramuscular fat, deeper fat that infiltrates the muscles, reduces muscle efficiency and has a negative impact on metabolic health,” says Dr Chung.\n\nAgeing, inactivity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity are linked to higher levels of this type of fat, but exercise – particularly resistance training – helps reduce it.\n\n“Targeting the glutes is essential as we age, as strong muscles act as an anchor for the whole body so we can continue to run, jump, react to falls, maintain good balance and more,” says Dr Chung.\n\n“Take more frequent breaks to get moving,” he says. Ideally, we should aim to stand up and move every 30-60 minutes.\n\n“Elevate your heels slightly with a rolled-up mat or towel, which will help you get deeper into the squat and really target the glutes,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nLie on your side, with your hand tucked under your head and knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Lift your top knee towards the ceiling like a clamshell opening, keeping hips stable and feet touching, and slowly lower back down. “It engages the glutes and also strengthens and stabilises the hips and core,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\n“Climb the stairs, or hills, or go hiking – find something that’s a bit more advanced than just walking,” says Dr Chung. This type of exercise will strengthen your leg muscles and give your entire cardiovascular system a workout as well as your glutes.\n\nTightening the buttocks for five seconds 10-15 times a day will activate and strengthen the muscles.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Chris Palmer, who went missing with his dog in the Outer Banks in North Carolina, is believed to be dead after his belongings were found along the coastline\n\nThe 39-year-old had gone to the Smoky Mountains to camp before he told his family signal was too spotty to stay in contact\n\nHis family has since shared that they “recently learned that Christopher was facing a terminal illness”\n\nA hiker, who went missing with his dog in the Outer Banks in North Carolina, is believed to be dead after his belongings were found.\n\nTwo weeks after Chris Palmer, 39, went missing in North Carolina, his father, Bren Palmer, shared on social media that he and his family made the “difficult decision” to put a stop to all active search efforts for his son.\n\n“We recently learned that Christopher was facing a terminal illness,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 24. “Knowing this has helped us understand the choices he made. Christopher loved the outdoors and valued his independence. The treatments ahead would have taken much of that away, and he did not want that future for himself.”\n\nNoting that Chris’s belongings were discovered near the coastline, Bren said that their family believes he “perished in the sea.”\n\n“As heartbreaking as this is, we have found a measure of peace in that understanding,” he continued. “We are deeply proud of the man Christopher was, and we hope his story brings awareness to the emotional and mental burdens people can face during serious medical challenges.”\n\n“We would like to thank the United Cajun Navy and every volunteer, first responder, and community member who searched for our son,” he added. “It has been profoundly humbling to see so many people care for someone they never met. Our family is at peace and asks that Christopher’s memory and the safety of others be respected as we seek closure.”\n\nThe update comes eight days after Chris was officially declared missing with his dog after a truck belonging to him was found on a North Carolina beach on Jan. 12, three days after he last made contact with his family, according to the National Park Service.\n\nIn a Jan. 20 news release, officials said, “Palmer is believed to be traveling with his German shepherd and may still be in the area.”\n\nTwo days later, the NPS shared in an update that, after reviewing Dare County traffic camera footage, investigators believe Palmer’s truck was in Dare County as early as the afternoon of Jan. 9. While it was not there when the vehicle was found on the beach, footage showed that there was a blue and white kayak in the back of the vehicle at the time.\n\nBren shared on Jan. 19 that his son went to the Smoky Mountains with his dog Zoey to camp 11 days prior.\n\n“He does alot of camping in the national forests,” he explained on Facebook. “He lets us know when and where he is going and when he is expected to return.”\n\nWhile he had received frequent communications from Chris up until Jan. 9, Bren noted that his son had told him that signal became too spotty to talk the day before his truck was found abandoned on the beach “hours away in the opposite direction he was headed.”\n\n“The National Park Service are currently searching for him with teams and infrared drones near  buxton,” he wrote at the time. “Im [sic] asking for prayers that he is found safe and send this to friends you might know in the mention areas.”",

    "fullText": "Tom Cruise has reportedly left the staff at his $47 million London apartment \"stunned\" by his abrupt departure from the UK.\n\nA source revealed that the actor, who once declared himself an \"Anglophile,\" made the decision to leave for the US \"very quickly,\" describing the move as \"strange.\"\n\nThis comes a few weeks after it was revealed that Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology had \"angered\" locals of East Grinstead with their disruptions while attending fundraisers in England.\n\nCruise has made an abrupt decision to move back to the US after spending years in the UK, where he was sometimes seen enjoying pub outings and even hanging out with the future king, Prince William.\n\nAccording to a source who spoke with the Mail on Sunday, staff were left \"stunned\" by his sudden departure, with some spotted removing boxes of possessions at the \"Mission Impossible\" star's £35 million [$47 million] London penthouse property, which overlooks Hyde Park.\n\nWhile the reason for his move is currently unclear, a source noted that it happened \"very quickly\" and seemingly out of the blue.\n\nSpeaking with the news outlet, the source said, \"Tom loved London. He loved where he lived; he would get up and go for [a] run around Hyde Park in the mornings. He loved walking in the local area, but he also really, really enjoyed jumping in a helicopter at Battersea Heliport and flying off into the quintessentially British countryside.\"\n\nThe source continued, \"It all happened very quickly; it was a surprise to the staff at the building where his penthouse is. It's most strange. The UK became both his professional headquarters and private playground, with discrete dates, tightly-guarded movements, and late-night arrivals.\"\n\n\"England became far more than just a filming base,\" they added about Cruise's sudden exit.\n\nBefore Cruise's decision to seemingly return to the US, he had become very well known for his love of the UK, where he had been making films for over 40 years.\n\nLast year, the actor was recognized for his contribution to the UK film industry and was awarded a BFI fellowship by the British Film Institute.\n\nAt the event held in May, Cruise noted, \"I'm truly honoured, I've been making films in the UK for over 40 years and have no plans to stop.\"\n\nBack in 2022, the actor also labeled himself an \"Anglophile\" because he spent a lot of \"time in Britain, and that's not just for work reasons.\"\n\n\"I just love being here,\" he stated at the time, per the Daily Mail. \"It's a fantastic blend of old and new... Britain is trendy, too, and has a lot that other countries then copy. I also love the British countryside.\"\n\nCruise was also said to have been interested in buying some properties in the Cotswolds, as he hoped to strengthen his ties to the UK, making his sudden departure, which reportedly included him removing his blackout curtains from his penthouse, even more puzzling.\n\nCruise, who has somewhat become the face of the Church of Scientology because of his vocal support over the years, recently came under fire after locals made complaints about him and his organization.\n\nThe actor makes it a point of duty to attend the Church's annual fundraiser in England. However, last year's edition in December allegedly \"angered\" residents of East Grinstead because of the disruption it brought to their everyday lives.\n\nThe small town located in West Sussex is home to the British headquarters of the Church and often receives guests in large numbers when such events are happening.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, former Scientologist Alexander Barnes-Ross said that the locals are \"extremely frustrated and angered\" by the instant increase in population during the fundraiser, and were particularly uncomfortable with the disturbance caused by Cruise \"flying in on his helicopter.\"\n\n\"It causes a lot of noise and nuisance, and he [Tom Cruise], you know, doesn't stop for photos or anything,\" Barnes-Ross shared.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, a resident described the Church's order of proceedings right from the preparation stages as \"very disruptive.\"\n\n\"For six to eight weeks, they were laying down pallets in the field to make a car park, so we had the disruption and noise of that, with lorry after lorry coming,\" the unidentified local said of Cruise's Church.\n\nDuring the event proper, more of such chaos would follow as the Church uses generators to power heavy equipment and also plays loud musical instruments.\n\nReports suggest the community feels \"helpless\" as to what they'll do, as some town leaders also attend the Church and have a good relationship with the organization.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, locals have since filed a complaint with the Mid Sussex District Council, noting that the event attended by Cruise and other high-profile church members causes \"considerable disruptions\" to the area.\n\nIt allegedly brings about traffic congestion and noise pollution. The complaint would see the Church's premises license undergo a review.\n\nIf the local community wins, the Church could be asked to tone down the large scale of events it organizes or implement measures to protect vulnerable people.",

    "description": "‘Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm,’ the former Georgia congresswoman wrote",
    "fullText": "Marjorie Taylor Greene has urged fellow MAGA supporters – and other Americans – to “take off their political blinders” over the death of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, warning that they are being “incited into civil war.”\n\n“I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement,” Greene wrote on X Sunday, the day after the fatal shooting. “However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment.\n\n“Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.”\n\nDespite video showing that 37-year-old Pretti was filming federal officers but did not have a weapon drawn, the Trump administration has claimed he had tried to assassinate agents in an act of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nThe incident was captured from multiple angles, including one that showed Pretti being sprayed with mace and wrestled to the ground while attempting to help a woman who had just been sprayed herself and had fallen to the ground. After being swarmed by around seven officers a shot rings out, followed by at least nine more, and Pretti falls still.\n\n“There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing,” Greene said.\n\nThe former Congresswoman asked MAGA to consider another scenario in which she replaced the protesters in Minnesota with those who supported the action on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\n“We lost our minds when we watched Biden’s FBI track down and aggressively carry out home invasions and arrest… peaceful J6’ers who walked in the Capitol through open doors,” she said.\n\n“Imaging [sic] if one of our MAGA independent journalists or even just a MAGA supporter stood in the street outside a J6’ers house while Biden’s FBI carried out a law enforcement operation, home invasion, and arrest.\n\n“Then Biden’s FBI goes to the MAGA guy videoing it all and shoves a woman with him to the ground and sprays them with bear spray then throws the MAGA guy to the ground as MAGA guy was trying to help the woman off the ground. Then Biden’s FBI beats MAGA guy on the ground, disarms MAGA guy, and then shoots him dead.\n\n“What would have been our reaction? Both sides need to take off their political blinders. You are all being incited into civil war, yet none of it solves any of the real problems that we all face, and tragically people are dying.”\n\nPretti’s death is the second fatal shooting to involve federal agents in Minneapolis in less than three weeks, following the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on January 7. Tensions and clashes between demonstrators have increased, as well as those between state and federal authorities.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said earlier Sunday that residents, as well as his own police department have “had enough.”\n\n“This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This has taken an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of trying to be the police department for a major city,” O’Hara told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nO’Hara noted that he has received no official information from the federal government related to Saturday’s shooting. “Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting,” he said.\n\nWhile the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was blocked from the scene of the shooting Saturday by federal officials, they were allowed access Sunday to canvas for witnesses.\n\nGreene’s comments represent the latest instance of her breaking from MAGA orthodoxy. Previously a firebrand Trump loyalist, she has publicly broken from the president in recent months over issues including the Epstein files and foreign policy. She stood down from Congress earlier this month.",
