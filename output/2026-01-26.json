    "description": "Spring training is almost here. When will Valdez sign?",
    "fullText": "Happy Monday, Camden Chatters! If you’re in Maryland or one of the other areas that got hit with winter weather, I hope you’re staying warm. Here in Columbia, we got about seven inches of snow and a whole lot of ice. I’ll be staying home again today, because who wants to go out if they don’t have to?\n\nIf you were hoping to spend the cold weekend warming your hands at the Hot Stove, you were left disappointed. There was no Orioles news and little other news. The White Sox signed Seranthony Dominguez to be their closer, and José Ramírez agreed to a contract extension with the Guardians through 2032. He must really like it there!\n\nThere was a bit of Orioles-adjacent info that came out, neither of which was too exciting. Hanser Alberto, whose best MLB season came with the Orioles in 2019, announced his retirement. Alberto hadn’t played in the majors since 2023. In 2019, Alberto hit .305/.329/422. He also had 12 home runs, which was nine more than in any other season. Best of luck in retirement, Hanser!\n\nThe other info that came out was an announcement by Tomoyuki Sugano that he doesn’t intend to return to Japan after one season with the Orioles. He plans to stay in MLB and is “waiting for offers.” I hope he gets one.\n\nOf course, there is also the thing that we’ve been talking about the entire off-season: pitching. Jim Bowden had a story in The Athletic on Friday ranking the remaining free agents. At the top of the list is Framber Valdez, who has surprisingly not signed yet. In his blurb on Valdez, this is what Bowden had to say:\n\nMost in the industry believe that he will eventually land with the Baltimore Orioles for fewer years than he anticipated at the beginning of free agency.\n\nAnything written by Bowden has to be taken with more than a few grains of salt, but I have to admit I enjoy reading that. Maybe this will be the week!\n\nBasallo and Beavers give Orioles a pair of prospects who should contribute in 2026 – MASN Sports\nA post you may have missed over the weekend. Roch Kubatko takes a look at the two highly-ranked prospects and what that could be for the Orioles with the PPI.\n\nHow a D.C. bar owner’s love of the Orioles shines through in enemy territory – The Baltimore Banner\nSome nice off-season content about Eebee’s Corner Bar in DC, owned and operated by an Orioles fan.\n\nHenderson talks about Orioles’ additions, shoulder injury – Baltimore Baseball\nIf you missed Gunnar Henderson’s interview on WBAL, Rich Dubroff has you covered.\n\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! You have three Orioles birthday buddies: Jemile Weeks (39), Rick Schu (64), and Bob Nieman (b. 1927, d. 1985). Weeks appeared in just three games with the Orioles, but I will always remember him as the trade return for Jim Johnson. By 2013, Johnson had been with the Orioles for eight years and was coming off of back-to-back 50-save seasons. He was due $10 million in salary, which seemed too much for the Orioles. So they sent him packing. The trade was a bit of a head-scratcher, but it turned out in the Orioles’ favor. Johnson was terrible in 2014. Anyway, sorry about not having a Jemile Weeks story on his birthday.\n\nOn this day in 2004, the Orioles re-signed Sidney Ponson to a three-year deal. They had traded him to San Francisco at the 2003 trade deadline and the Orioles just had to get him back. Ponson’s second stint with the Orioles did not go so well. In two seasons, he was terrible. The Orioles released him with a year left on his contract for violating their morals clause. Ponson had a number of legal run-ins, including the infamous judge-punching incident.\n\nIn 2015, the Orioles signed Chris Parmelee to a minor-league contract. He was called up in early June and had four hits, two of which were home runs, in his first game. It was very exciting! Things fell off after that, and he ended up missing the last few months with injury. He was never heard from again in Baltimore.\n\nIn 2021, the Orioles signed infielder Freddy Galvis. He played in 72 games with Baltimore before going back to Philadelphia at the trade deadline.\n\nAnd in 2023, the Orioles traded for pitcher Cole Irvin. They sent prospect Darrell Hernaiz to the then-Oakland Athletics and got Irvin and minor-leaguer Kyle Virbitsky in return. Irvin spent two seasons in Baltimore, splitting his time between the rotation and the bullpen. He did not have much success, but was an easy guy to root for. There was some heartburn among Orioles fans over sending away an interesting prospect in Hernaiz, but so far he hasn’t done much with the Athletics. He’s still young, though, just 24 years old.",

There is a linked story down below about it, but even then, what goes on after the top three in the order hit? Where does Adolis Garcia fit in all of this?\n\nIt’s possible that Bryce Harper will no longer be the #3 hitter in the lineup. He might switch with Kyle Schwarber ($).\n\nAaron Nola is going to be a very important piece for the team in 2026. Here is how he can get back on track next season.\n\nJust when you thought the Mets couldn’t get any better this offseason, they went and added to their bullpen.\n\nAdding Andrew McCutchen for one more season seems like a no-brainer for the Pirates, yet this is the Pirates, so…\n\nImagine John Middleton cold calling Phillies fans this winter. How would that go? Probably as well as the Twins’ owner doing the same ($).\n\nThe Giants made a pretty bold move to try and acquire CJ Abrams ($). Maybe it’ll happen?",

    "title": "From ‘Bono’ to ‘Bozo’ already? Just let NY Giants coach John Harbaugh do his work",
    "description": "Some are already irate over choices the Giants’ new head coach is making about his assistant coaches.",
    "fullText": "It is amazing how quickly the opinions of some fans can change. And, how small things no one has any idea ill prove to be right or wrong can be the cause.\n\nWhen John Harbaugh, a Super Bowl-winning head coach with 12 playoff appearances in 18 years as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens was hired less than two weeks, there was nearly absolute joy in Giants Nation. In our poll asking if hiring Harbaugh was the right decision, 95.21% (5,227) of 5,490 voters said it was.\n\nThere were comments like these:\n\nHarbaugh and Dart will deliver us another SB, I truly believe that\n\nDart’s retiring with more rings than Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson combined. Book it.\n\nI haven’t seen Big Blue Viewers this aligned on a decision in my life. May the next decade be one of redemption.\n\nNo other hiring would have been met with the excitement, or brought the instant credibility that Harbaugh did. The Giants have been flailing for more than a decade now, going mostly in the wrong direction. Harbaugh offers them the best chance for a course correction.\n\nHe comes from a winning environment that he was a big part of establishing and maintaining. He brings with him knowledge of how the Ravens have been consistently good, and the cachet to get ideas implemented with the Giants. We are already seeing some of that take place. He brings a reputation with him for having a keen eye for finding quality young assistant coaches who could help set the organization up for sustained success.\n\nOn the field and in the locker room, Harbaugh is a culture-setting CEO type head coach who brings the ability — and credibility — to set standards and hold players accountable. The Giants, and the entire organization, desperately need that.\n\nRemember John Mara warning Brian Daboll after he won Coach of the Year honors for the 2022 season that it wasn’t hard to go from ‘Bono’ to ‘Bozo’ in the New York/New Jersey market?\n\nWell, when he was introduced as the team’s head coach last Tuesday, Harbaugh was clearly ‘Bono.’ Maybe the Beatles. In a more modern reference, perhaps Taylor Swift.\n\nToday, there are already fans throwing darts at him.\n\nFirst, Harbaugh had the temerity to send Carmen Bricillo, a popular, effective offensive line coach, packing. That led to comments like these:\n\nThis sucks especially if George Warhop is the guy to take over. Nice guy in his 60’s with lots of oline coaching experience. Unfortunately heading up many underwhelming lines.\n\nThis is a questionable move at best. I just don’t understand why he wouldn’t stay — especially since he was under contract for another year and has proven that he can work wonders with what he’s given. I also find it strange since Jack Harbaugh gave a ringing endorsement and told him to keep him. I don’t understand this at all.\n\nSo there was no bigger supporter of the JH acquisition than MaineG1…. But this is a major disappointment! I don’t understand the reason behind fixing something that’s been so horribly wrong for such a long time under any circumstance. For anyone making claims that this is just minor move and, there’s no reason for concern. You obviously haven’t been paying attention over the last 10 years. Before Bricillo, the offensive line was one of the 3 worst in NFL history.\n\nI can’t understand that Harbaugh looked at that man’s resume and came to the conclusion he could get someone better? Direct disciple of Dante Scarnecchia. Plus the job he did with the Raiders. Who by the way, were an absolute shit show just slightly less terrible than the steaming pile of dung the Giants had been trotting out over the past decade.\n\nI was also a fan of Patterson, but the run defense over the last 3 years has been dreadful…. So letting him go makes sense, but, Bricillo is a head scratcher. I also hope the plan isn’t to bring in the Oline coach from the Ravens? For those who don’t know? Joe D passed away at the beginning of the season and, was replaced by George Warhop. He was the offensive line coach for the 49ers and, Bucs I believe in the early 2000s. For the most part those lines were terrible…. 2024 under Joe D, the offensive line was really good. 2025 under Warhop, absolutely shitty. This can’t be the way.\n\nThen, Harbaugh went and hired a defensive coordinator some fans think is terrible.\n\nAnother bad Tennessee DC. I have, misgivings.\n\nOkay, it was a mistake to hire Harbaugh. Everything is going to hell. Fire Schoen. The Mara’s should be forced to sell the team. Trade Dart for draft picks. Burn it to the ground.\n\nWas hoping this was not true. Here’s his report card for his last season :\n\nTotal Defense Rank: 21st in yards, 28th in points\n\nOpponent Points: 478 allowed (28th)\n\nWay to really go for excellence Coach! Forget the guy coaching in the AFC championship or the passing coordinator in one of the most complex, vicious, aggressive modern defenses. Let’s get a guy who managed to coach a 3 win teams defense to the 28th ranking.\n\nWe really managed to grab a guy from one of the only programs worse than ours, who has no idea what winning looks like, who’s defense just Barely ranked better than Shane Bowen and Bullen…? Just fking wow.\n\nLosing Bricillo and Patterson this week coupled with this latest absurd hire, It’s been a very bad week for John harbaugh.\n\nHopefully he can at least get Monken in here.\n\nFolks around here acting like Harbs just hired Shane Bowen again!\n\nGiants fans last weekend – Give Harbaugh whatever he wants, just get him signed! In Harbaugh we trust!!!\n\nGiants fans this weekend – What??? He hired a different guy than the one I wanted?? Harbaugh out!!!\n\nHarbaugh was never going to make every decision you or I would have made. Yes, I was hoping he would keep Carmen Bricillo as offensive line coach. He didn’t. So be it. There will be more decisions you don’t like. Harbaugh will be right about some, wrong about others. Probably, he will be right far more often than he is wrong.\n\nHarbaugh has an 18-year body of really successful work with the Baltimore Ravens and a Rolodex compiled over something like four decades of coaching that earned him a five-year, $100 million contract and the ability to make the decisions he wants to make.\n\nHarbaugh is the best, most capable, most qualified person the Giants have hired on their coaching staff or in their front office since they let Tom Coughlin go after the 2015 season.\n\nHe knows what he wants in an offensive line coach. He knows plenty of people who could tell him what he wanted to know about Bricillo’s work, and his coaching style. He met with Bricillo himself. He decided Bricillo wasn’t the right coach for what he wanted. I would rather have him make that choice than keep a coach on staff he wasn’t certain about to appease the fan base, or the offensive linemen.\n\nMaybe Harbaugh will hire George Warhop, a long-time NFL offensive line coach who was with him in Baltimore the last two seasons. Maybe he will hire someone else. Maybe it will turn out well. Maybe it won’t.\n\nWhen it comes to Wilson, again Harbaugh is far more qualified to make this decision and knows far more about Wilson than any of us.\n\nYou can simply point to the 2025 statistics that showed Wilson’s Tennessee defense 28th in points and 21st in yardage allowed, and decide he is a terrible coach and a terrible hire. Or, you can look deeper.\n\nYou can look back at 2024, his first season. His bio on the Titans’ website, which likely won’t be available much longer, includes this:\n\nDuring Wilson’s first year in Tennessee, the Titans ranked second overall in total defense (311.2 opponent yards per game)—the team’s highest ranking since leading the NFL in total defense in 2000. The 2024 Titans also finished second in passing defense (177.3), which also was their best ranking since 2000 (first). Wilson’s defense tied for the fifth-fewest first downs allowed per game (18.5) and tied for the fifth-fewest opponent yards allowed per play (5.2) in 2024.\n\nYou can trust ESPN Titans beat writer Turron Davenport, who told me recently that Wilson “wasn’t given much to work with” in 2025 but did a good job.\n\nYou can trust Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons, who wanted Wilson to stay in Tennessee.\n\nJeffery Simmons understands it's not up to him BUT if he has it his way, he'd love to have Dennard Wilson back with the #Titans. pic.twitter.com/Kc4Qhxurko\n\n— TURRON DAVENPORT (@TDavenport_NFL) December 31, 2025\n\nYou can trust Jimmy Morris of SB Nation’s Music City Miracles, who wrote this recently predicting Wilson would land with the Giants:\n\nWilson did a really good job with the Titans this year. The numbers weren’t great, but you have to account for the fact that all three of his starting corners were either traded or injured for most of the season. He also had zero EDGE presence for the entire year.\n\nI thought that Wilson would land as the defensive coordinator for John with the New York Giants. He might still, but it would be surprising if he took the Chargers interview with Jim, knowing he could get the Giants job with John.\n\nThe Giants brought in Harbaugh because of his record of success. He is, naturally, going to want to bring in people he knows and has had success with.\n\nMaybe at least wait until the Giants blow a fourth-quarter lead next fall because of a decision Harbaugh makes that backfires before thinking he is a Bozo.",

    "title": "Basketball Preview: Michigan State @ Rutgers",
    "description": "The Spartans look to run their winning streak to seven games",
    "fullText": "The Michigan State Spartans will have just over 72 hours to calm down from the program’s second biggest ever margin of victory in a Big Ten game (we defeated u*m by 51 points in 2000) in order to prepare for a road tilt against Rutgers. After sweeping their west-coast trip and then demolishing Maryland at home by 43 points, MSU gets back on a plane and now heads to the Atlantic seaboard to take on another sub-.500 team. The Scarlet Knights have a 2-9 record in conference games and 9-11 overall. They have lost three straight and four of their last five. I guess it is also worth noting in this intro that the state of New Jersey is going to have subzero temperatures for the next few days along with expected snow and ice; hopefully this does not complicate the team’s travel plans.\n\nIf we are to try and find clues from Rutgers first 20 games to see how this game could go, we should focus in on their four games against ranked opponents. So far this year, the Knights have played the then-#17 (now unranked) Tennessee Volunteers on a neutral-court, hosted Purdue and visited u*m in their December conference games, and travelled to Illinois earlier this month. I’m sure you already guessed that they lost all four of those games. None of them were close, with the narrowest loss being by 16 against Purdue. The average score of those matchups was 87-60.\n\nOutside of those four blowouts, where Rutgers holds a 9-7 record, their best win is arguably their November win over the American University Eagles. I only rank them so high because they are at least in contention for their conference championship, currently just a game behind Navy in the Patriot League. Rutgers’ two conference wins were overtime affairs at home against Oregon and Northwestern – two of the four teams below them in the Big Ten standings.\n\nAssuming MSU can put themselves in a category with Illinois, Purdue, and u*m (who along with MSU and Nebraska occupy the top of the conference table), then there is reason to believe that MSU should win handily on Tuesday night. But before we jump to any easy conclusions, let’s take a closer look at these Scarlet Knights.\n\nAs should be the case with any team that is struggling, there have been some fluctuations to the Knights’ starting five. A total of nine different players have started a game this season, and none of that appears to be due to injuries as the six guys who have started at least ten games have missed a total of two games on the year.\n\nJamichael Davis, PG – We can slot Davis into the starting lineup as has been the case in 19 games so far. He leads the team in minutes (27.5), is 4th in scoring (7.6), and leads them in assists (2.6). He only turns it over once per game. At 6’2” and 180 pounds, he has a similar build to Jeremy Fears Jr.\n\nKaden Powers, SG – Powers has only started six games all year, but he has been getting the nod lately as Davis’s backcourt partner. He has scored at least 8 points in eight of the last ten games and reached double digits twice in that stretch. He is a freshman and has been improving as his first season of college ball goes on.\n\nDylan Grant, SF – The second wing spot is possibly the most contentious for Rutgers. While Grant has started 17 games including their last contest, he did come off the bench the previous two. He is the team’s 2nd leading scorer at 11.1 and also 2nd with 4.6 rebounds while playing 23.7 minutes per game. That said, he is trending in the wrong direction, totaling just 21 points in the last six games. If he does not start, this spot likely goes to…\n\nHarun Zrno, SF – The freshman from Bosnia & Herzegovina started those two games that Grant recently came off the bench for. He scored 21 in one of those games but put up a bagel in the other, just as he did in the most recent game where he was back coming off the bench. On the season, he has started ten games and averages 6.1 PPG.\n\nDarren Buchanan Jr., PF – Officially listed as a guard on Rutgers’ website, Buchanan has been playing the 4-spot due to his size and strength. At 6’7” and with a broad 235-pound frame, Buchanan has had to play inside for Rutgers. Only six starts on the year, but has been the guy lately and has played at least 25 minutes in their last three games (and went for 41 minutes in the game before that, the OT win over NW, where he had a 14-point and 10-rebound performance). He is averaging over 11 PPG in the last six games.\n\nEmmanuel Ogbole, C – Another international player, the 6’10” senior from Nigeria has started all but three games, and even in those games, he received more minutes than his replacement. While he leads the team with 6.9 rebounds per game, he only averages 4.9 points, which contributes to his lower minutes totals than the other starters.\n\nTariq Francis, G – Here is the most interesting piece of Rutgers’ roster. Francis has been their leading scorer at 15.9 PPG in 26 minutes, 2nd most on the team, but has only started 10 games this year, and you would have to go back to December 13 to find the most recent example.\n\nBasically, while Rutgers will most likely start a traditional PG/SG/SF/PF/C lineup, look for them to play a lot of minutes with a third guard and a smaller rotation to get their best offensive players on the court. Of course, with MSU’s size, this could and should lead to a massive rebounding advantage for the Spartans, and everything that comes along with that.\n\nI won’t go so far as to predict a trap game. The Spartans should win this game comfortably. But a Tuesday night game against Rutgers in the midst of a brutal stretch of weather and with our in-state rival coming to our arena three days later, I would not be surprised if the halftime score is within single digits. Of course, MSU, as they have been known to do this season, will enforce their will in the second half and pull away for that big win that Rutgers’ other ranked opponents have been able to collect against them. I will predict a 25-point win, 82-57.\n\nThe game tips off at 6:30 PM ET and will air on FS1.\n\n@Wankerman, please let me know when you are done proofreading this article.\n\nAnd here are a few more photos from the last game…",

    "description": "Frank Seravalli floated that the Bruins might have checked in on Elias Pettersson. Is the embattled Center a",
    "fullText": "As the Winter Olympics come screaming into focus, the league has experienced a bit of a frenzy of moves to get assets before the great unknown of playing in Milan and/or Cortina potentially leaves them without stars for the last few months of the NHL season. Thanks to the truncated schedule, a bunch of teams are already beginning to make moves after looking at their upcoming schedules, their current records, and their current trends, and making painful decisions on whether or not they’ve got any real shot in the NHL Playoffs.\n\nOne such team is the Vancouver Canucks, who have been a never ending cavalcade of Drama, Woe, and Disaster for the better part of half a decade, and at the center of it all is their # 1 Center, who they are finally willing to listen to other teams about offers for.\n\nAccording to Frank Seravalli, the Bruins have checked in on this player.\n\nElias Pettersson is generally supposed to be Sweden’s big wunderkind player right now. Should be, anyway. He should’ve shown up with an “A” at minimum for Tre Kronor at the Olympics and we should all be looking at Sweden with him at the top of his game and going “oh they’re gonna medal and it’s gonna be a short game.” Still might be, too.\n\nPettersson is by all accounts an extremely high skill forward, able to do a little bit of everything; he’s got incredible hands, he’s a damn strong skater, he’s willing to get into the dirty areas of the ice and cause a little havoc that way, his shot can feel like a game-warping moment, and when he is on his horse, he never, ever, ever gives up on a play. Even when he should, but he doesn’t need to; he can make something happen.\n\nAll of this can be yours…assuming the team around him isn’t actively self-injecting poison into itself in a desperate attempt to make their insane owner or alternate captain or general manager or fanbase happy.\n\nWhich unfortunately for Mr. Pettersson, is where the problem starts, and why he is reportedly available.\n\nPettersson is like Quinn Hughes, in that he has been part of propping up a Canucks team that was much farther back on their development curve than they believed, and struggled to really find a place for himself in multiple systems, and watched as his impressive point totals slowly fell into hell, and while he is rebounding this year and looks to be on pace for a 60ish point season, which has been around where his floor is, and what’s hoping to be a reasonably deep run in the Olympics, its a far cry from his 100 point ‘22-‘23 season and his 89 point ‘23-‘24, and trying to replicate those two seasons has been an active nightmare for the Canucks. They know he’s good!…they just gotta make JT Miller happy, or change coaches, or keep swapping deck chairs on the Titanic, or go through like six goalies in a month leading into the playoffs.\n\nElias Pettersson’s career has been a lot of really cool skill plays and solid work as an NHL center buried under a mountain of bulls#!t; some of it from his own team, some of it from slumps he made himself, some of it the natural consequence of a team riding the PDO wagon until it fell out from under them, all of it too much for both parties at this point. Vancouver needs to make major changes and make them fast, and they are reportedly okay with asking about just about anyone, and that does include Pettersson, who would likely fetch another big return after the Quinn Hughes trade.\n\nThe big issue that Pettersson has faced throughout his career is that there’s been some horses#!t going on around him pretty much at all times. Anyone’s game would suffer because of that. Great players have had miserable years thanks to their organization making life difficult. Pettersson’s game has had a lot of that, and as a result he’s had a ton of linemates and a ton of revolving wingers and he’s never really been able to get a good bead on who he should be with coach after coach either loving or despising him. That’s forced him to play very into his game, very out of it, and it has messed with his analytics. I cannot definitively prove this, but I believe it contributes to the issues he faces.\n\nThe other big issue is that the Canucks committed a ton of money to him…and he’s struggled quite a bit to justify that since putting pen to ink, especially recently.\n\nPettersson has not been playing like a 1C for a very long time, and the Canucks have attached a nice big dead sea bird (of which it is bad luck to kill, Willem Dafoe said so.) to his neck, ensuring that every game where he doesn’t have a point feels worse and worse and piles doubt after doubt after doubt on this player.\n\nAnd sure, that one viz is gonna maybe make people feel a little concerned, but I need to make it clear that this is a long-standing problem for him; over the last three years, he’s 12th among Canucks skaters in shot attempts and unblocked shot attempts for per 60 minutes, and 11th in expected goals-for per 60 minutes.\n\nHronek, Hughes, and Tyler actual Myers have better rates of unblocked shots than him. Nils Hoglander, a player the Bruins once checked in on fiercely before joining the NHL and is playing like 12 minutes a night in Vancouver, has objectively better rates of getting the puck up ice than Pettersson.\n\nThis does ignore however that, if we are being fair to him and acknowledging that he is also playing on a dogass team full of dog-ass players, he has improved. He is now 4th on the Canucks in expected goals for per 60, and 8th in shot attempts and unblocked shot attempts for. That is…maybe not worth the obscene price tag? But it is decidedly better than he’s been, and a trend in the right direction for him.\n\nAnd to be mean, 51.09% on the year is a damn sight better than another center on the Boston Bruins who gets similar ice time to Pettersson. It may not be the most efficient use of money…BUT! he would be An Upgrade.\n\nThere is also the chance, especially given his skill ceiling and who his linemates would be, that the Bruins, with their world class wingers and culture of Making Players Feel Valued and Want To Give Back and the fabled “Bruins Bump” and all that…that he could in fact resurrect the player he was in his earlier years. This guy is still in here somewhere in theory; if you figure out where he is under what you will be hoping are years of mismanagement by Vancouver.\n\nThe Canucks are in shambles. They are by far the worst team in the Pacific Division as well as the Western Conference, and that is stiff competition at the moment. You will be going for one of maybe players who’s getting anything done on the Canucks right now (and one of them is now in San Jose), and it will herald the beginning of a great big long down-to-the-studs rebuild for Vancouver.\n\nThat is a first round pick among many to begin with; especially for the Bruins, who will likely find themselves with a half-decent choice in the middle or top 10 of the draft.\n\nThat’s Alberts Smits. That’s Adam Novotny, Oscar Hemming, Caleb Malholtra, Ryan Lin that you are giving to the Canucks, which is not including the roster player and one of the vanishingly few prospects of note in the Bruins’ system.\n\nThey may not turn into anything! But they might become something, and you gave them that for an asset that they have well and truly spent a lot of time crushing the confidence of and now you gotta rehab and convince the Canucks to retain salary on, because there’s no way in hell they can fit his preposterous contract under their cap right now.\n\nThe Boston Bruins under Don Sweeney are more than willing to gamble if given the opportunity. They have gambled frequently and sometimes it’s even worked.\n\nEven then…This will be a hell of a gamble if they decide they wanna do it.\n\nIf the Bruins think they can rehab this player, and commit to making him work for the long haul, even knowing he may cost them one of their extremely first round picks, even knowing that the last guy you were hoping gets a Bruins Bump Did Not Actually Get One because the team isn’t nearly as good as it used to be, even knowing it may end up losing them one of the few in and out excellent players on the year or one of the potential future stars of the team because let me make it clear you are not sending Elias Lindholm back the other way, they need young guys and they need talented guys and the Bruins don’t really have a lot of either, if you are aware your fanbase and certain sections of this market’s media is gonna be on him from day one if he doesn’t show improvement…then I suppose my answer is go for it.\n\nBut you need to be sure. You need to be absolutely sure.\n\nBecause if you make this choice, you will be locked into it. His contract has an NMC. You may not pay all of it! But you will be paying some of it. And you will be stuck to it like glue.\n\nYou wanna make that call in year one of a retool?",

    "description": "The U.S. speed skater tells PEOPLE about her and Team USA hockey star Hilary Knight's first dates during the 2022 Winter Olympics",
    "fullText": "Nearly a decade into her competitive speed skating career, Brittany Bowe finally achieved her dream of standing on an Olympic podium at the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\nBut when you ask her about her memories of that time, she’s quick to point out that it was actually falling for girlfriend Hilary Knight that stands out the most.\n\n“That was the biggest win coming out of Beijing for sure,” Bowe, 37, tells PEOPLE about meeting her partner, the U.S. women’s ice hockey captain, that February.\n\n“Hilary and I have known each other for a number of years through different Team USA events, a number of different Olympics, but that's the first time we really did have time to connect and get to know one another,” Bowe says. “And it was everything other than glamorous, that's for sure! Hilary would ask, like, ‘Oh, do you want to go for a walk after dinner?’ And that was our first date, going to walk around the Olympic Village masked because everyone was so fearful of getting COVID.”\n\nSoon, the couple’s walking dates became dinner dates.\n\n“[It was] a very unique way to meet someone, but it was also kind of cool because we felt like we were in this bubble,” Bowe recalls. “We didn't have the family, the friends, no outside distractions. And we really had a lot of time just to get to know each other.”\n\nFour years later, the two share a home in Salt Lake City, and will soon be packing their bags for what may be each of their final Winter Olympics. (They'll be leaving behind the fancy handmade Italian coffee machine they recently purchased to prepare for the trip: “We've been watching hours of videos,” Knight laughed to PEOPLE.)\n\nNow, however, their focus will both be on bringing home medals as part of Team USA – Bowe as a veteran member of the U.S. speed skating squad, and Knight as the captain of the U.S. women’s hockey team.\n\nBowe is excited for the 2026 Winter Games — particularly the return to fans in the stands, as they were still barred from attending in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“I know both of our families are really excited to watch both of us compete,” Bowe says. “My family's already got their hockey tickets, and her family's getting the speed skating tickets. So, just to have more people in the stands that love you, support you, are part of your journey — that will make it really special.”\n\nA Florida native who first took up inline skating after a local coach noticed her gliding down the rink at a friend’s birthday party, Bowe didn’t seriously consider ice skating until she found herself watching old friends from her inline days compete for Team USA at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\n“My path to the Olympics is definitely not linear,” says the former Florida Atlantic University point guard, who set aside her plans to make it to the WNBA after becoming infatuated with ice skating during those 2010 Winter Games.\n\nDespite not being “an adrenaline junkie at all” when she’s off the ice, \"I love pushing myself to the limit\" in competition, Bowe says. She adds that winning is “an addiction” that gives her “no better feeling in the world.”\n\nAnd when the 2026 Winter Olympics come to a close, regardless of the outcome, her lifelong dream of having an Olympic career will have been accomplished.\n\n“More than anything, [I’m excited about] just being able to compete and represent my country,” Bowe says. “I can't think of a better way to end my career than with the flag on me and my family in the stands.”\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

Until this time, the top minor leagues could control their players and refuse to sell them. (2)\n\n1932 – Chicago Cubs owner William Wrigley dies at the age of 70 in Phoenix, Arizona. Wrigley had owned the team since 1919.

The committee hopes the return to the 1950s strike zone will result in a decrease in runs scored. The results will exceed the committee’s expectations, and after the “Year of the Pitcher” in 1968, the strike zone will be tweaked again to give the hitters a break.

    "title": "Cowboys news: Exploring options to fill defensive needs this offseason",
    "description": "The latest Cowboys news",
    "fullText": "There are a lot of holes to address this offseason, and Dallas has several options to accomplish that.\n\nTrevon Diggs is no longer on the roster and DaRon Bland is rehabbing from a serious foot injury. What was once viewed as a massive strength just 12 months ago, is now a serious concern. The Cowboys hope they found a long-term solution in 2025 third-round pick Shavon Revel, but he had a tough rookie season that inspires more doubt than confidence.\n\nPlayers like Reddy Steward, Caelen Carson and Josh Butler are decent depth pieces, but no one wants to roll into 2026 with any of them penciled in as starters. It’s likely the Cowboys need multiple starting quality players at CB this offseason which means significant investment by way of cash or draft capital.Expert NFL picks: Exclusive betting insights only at USA TODAY.\n\nFree agents Tariq Woolen (26), Jamel Dean (29), Eric Stokes (26), Greg Newsome (25), Roger McCreary (25), Alontae Taylor (27) and Cam Taylor-Britt (26) all look to cash in on major contracts this spring. Oddly enough, the CB who’s projected to command the most per Spotrac estimates is former Cowboys CB Nahshon Wright.\n\nChristian Parker is already working to assemble his team.\n\nNew Cowboys DC Christian Parker seems like he wants to put together his own staff\n\nLetting Parker and Brian Schottenheimer (mostly Parker) put together his own staff is unequivocally the right call.\n\nIt would be a different story if even one assistant had exceeded expectations this season and players were lobbying for them to return, but that wasn’t the case. Not a single position group punched above its weight class. Defensive back, linebacker, defensive line. You name it. Every unit struggled.\n\nFortunately for Parker, some assistants have gotten a head start with seeking other opportunities.\n\nPer ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, the Titans have requested an interview with Cowboys defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton for their DC vacancy. That isn’t entirely surprising, as Whitecotton and newly minted Titans head coach Robert Saleh have coached together at three different stops.\n\nTime for Christian Parker to get his guys.\n\nThe Cowboys haven’t lacked talent on defense, but they have lacked unpredictability. Everything in 2025 looked the same before the snap, and offenses have known exactly where to go with the ball.\n\nParker’s background suggests that’s not how he wants to run a defense. His approach leans toward more movement, disguise, and putting more on the safeties to read what’s developing instead of just sitting.\n\nThat alone could put the safety position front and center in this reset.\n\nWhy Cole Wisniewski Works for Dallas\n\nWisniewski isn’t flashy, but at 6’4” and around 220 pounds, he brings a presence the Cowboys haven’t consistently had over the middle of the field.\n\nHe doesn’t float in coverage or drift out of position, and he understands spacing well enough to anticipate where routes are headed instead of reacting late.\n\nWhen you watch him rotate, it’s decisive. When he is sitting in zone, throwing lanes tighten and quarterbacks don’t get the same clean looks they’re used to.\n\nThat is the type of safety I believe Christian Parker can do things with.\n\nDallas is not giving the Eagles an inch.\n\nA couple of days after Dallas poached Christian Parker from the Eagles’ coaching staff, Philly tried for a little revenge. The Eagles’ reportedly asked to interview Cowboys offensive coordinator Klayton Adams for the same job, but Dallas denied the request.\n\nThe Cowboys were able to block Philly’s access to Adams according to NFL rules for lateral moves among coaches. When a new team is offering a promotion, as Dallas did with Parker, the current employer cannot stop them. Parker was serving as the Eagles’ defensive backs coach and was still under contract for 2026, but the Cowboys made him their new defensive coordinator on Friday.\n\nBecause Philadelphia was only interested in Adams as their new OC, the same title he has in Dallas currently, the Cowboys were able block it.",

    "fullText": "DeMarcus Lawrence’s brutally honest assessment of his Super Bowl chances with the Dallas Cowboys has resurfaced after Seattle booked its place in Super Bowl 60.\n\nWhat once sounded like resignation has now become a defining statement, as Lawrence’s belief about Dallas and championship ceilings aligns perfectly with how his career path ultimately unfolded.\n\nSpeaking candidly, DeMarcus Lawrence did not shy away from addressing his time with the Cowboys and what he believed it meant for his championship hopes.\n\n“Change of scenery is always good, but Dallas is my home. Made my home there, my family lives there,” Lawrence said in 2025.\n\nHe added: “I’m forever gonna be there, but I know for sure I’m not going to win a Super Bowl there. So yeah, we here.”\n\nLawrence spent the core of his NFL career with the Cowboys after being selected in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft. He became one of the franchise’s defensive pillars, earning multiple Pro Bowl selections and consistently leading the team in sacks.\n\nDespite regular playoff appearances, Dallas failed to reach a Super Bowl during Lawrence’s tenure. Postseason exits, often in the divisional round, defined the era, reinforcing Lawrence’s view that something was missing despite the talent on the roster.\n\nThat perspective now looks prophetic following Seattle’s NFC Championship victory, which secured the Seahawks a place in Super Bowl 60.\n\nLawrence’s move brought him into a system that quickly capitalized on postseason opportunities, something that never materialized during his years in Dallas. The contrast between the two experiences has sharpened the impact of his earlier remarks.\n\nWhile Lawrence has always spoken fondly of the Cowboys and his life in Dallas, his statement was never about bitterness. It was about outcomes, and those outcomes have now validated his belief.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 approaches, Lawrence stands on the sport’s biggest stage, with his words no longer sounding controversial but instead, remarkably accurate.\n\nSeattle Seahawks’ reaching Super Bowl is surprisingly related to Popes of Vatican City\n\nSeahawks give major health update on Sam Darnold amid NFC Championship game preparations\n\nTom Brady told Seattle Seahawks star he ‘could have used’ him at University of Michigan",

    "title": "BYB 2026 Tigers prospect reports #38: LHP Paul Wilson",
    "description": "The 2023 3rd rounder has stalled out in pro ball with a 2025 UCL surgery.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers 2023 draft is currently on track to be among their best ever. That draft is going to be remembered for Max Clark in the first round, and an absolute steal in Kevin McGonigle in the competitive balance round. Second rounder Max Anderson has a shot to make his presence felt in the big leagues as well. Third rounder Paul Wilson was a high school star and one of the best prep left-handers in his class. The pick was well received, but Wilson struggled mightily in 2024 and then needed UCL reconstruction in April 2025. The goal now is just to get him back on the mound and working sometime this summer.\n\nThe Tigers paid the Oregon product $755,000 over slot as a third rounder to pass on his college commitment to Oregon State, and Wilson had a lot of other teams interested in doing the same. The Tigers were happy to get to him first, and landed a pretty advanced young pitcher who had been coached up from an early age by his father Trevor, himself an eight veteran MLB pitcher.\n\nWilson’s 2024 Complex League debut was really rocky. He didn’t pitch that much, making eight starts, until he was shut down in late July with an undisclosed injury. Prior to that, he’d shown a pretty deep repertoire of pitches, but was also plagued by some stretches of wildness as he tried to implement some adjustments to his delivery.\n\nIn 2025, he started the season with Single-A Lakeland and while his stuff looked nastier, he was still fighting his delivery through a couple of short outings before the injury ended his season. Wilson has a quick arm and some deception from a pretty prototypical high three-quarters arm slot. He appeared to have added some good muscle and his balance and lead leg blocking both looked better than in his high school days. Unfortunately, his velocity was also down a good bit, and he still sometimes threw some very wild pitches, both proving to be harbingers of the elbow injury brewing.\n\nUCL reconstruction at Wilson’s age obviously delays his progress, but nowadays the odds are quite high that the surgery and rehab will be a success. Tarik Skubal didn’t have access to the top surgeons in the game when he had the procedure as a college freshman, and he’s done alright. So with a bit of luck, Wilson will be back on the mound sometime late this summer for a little work, and then ready to go full speed again in 2027. The problem is that he’ll be 22 years old by the time he gets a full season of work in, putting him on the same track as a college draft pick, but with far less experience.\n\nWith two and half years since his draft day, minimal progress and now a major injury, it would be reasonable to drop Wilson off the board entirely, but the potential he showed in high school is still actionable and it’s worth giving him through 2027 before writing him off. Drafting prep pitchers is a high risk, high reward game, but either way one has to expect that in most cases things are not going to go smoothly. The advantage is that while top college pitchers are safer, they’re also snatched up in the first two or three rounds of the draft. Using your bonus pool to sign a bunch of talented prep pitchers later in the draft gives you a shot at some real home runs. That’s going to come with some big misses too. Wilson may prove to be one of them, but for now we’ll give him the same amount of time we’d give a college pitcher before making any final verdicts on his future.\n\nAs a highly regarded prep pitcher, Wilson was comfortably 92-94 mph with his fourseamer, occasionally reaching back for a little extra. In high school he also showed off an advanced curveball-changeup combination and both pitches showed out pretty well in his brief 2025 work though command remained sketchy. The fourseam shape needed some tweaking to get better carry, and there were signs of that, as well as good progress with his slider, in 2025. Combined with good control, a projectibile frame that promised more velocity, and good feel for pitching overall for his age, there was a ton to like on draft day.\n\nWhat we need to see this year is Wilson back on the mound after the All-Star break with his velocity intact. In 2027, a real leap is going to be required or Wilson may just drift off into org starter territory, a far cry from the mid-rotation upside he had on draft day.",

    "fullText": "Arriving on Tyneside in the summer of 2019, the Brazilian initially carried a price tag, role and expectations that never quite fit. Signed as a striker, tasked with lead the line, Joelinton became a symbol of frustration in a struggling side.\n\nGoals were scarce, confidence even scarcer and every missed chance seemed to weigh a little more than the last. Many players don't survive that kind of start. Fewer still go on to be adored.\n\nJoelinton told newcastleunited.com: \"It's a great feeling to play 250 games for a massive club like Newcastle. It's a club with history and the best fans in the world, playing at St. James' Park. It makes me proud that I never gave up and followed my dreams, giving everything I have.\n\n\"I never thought I would play this amount of games. I never thought I'd be here for so many years but I enjoy every moment here. I hope there's more to come because I have many dreams to achieve with the club. Hopefully, we can stay together for more years.\"\n\nThe turning point came with a change of position. After Eddie Howe's managerial appointment in November 2022, Joelinton was no longer boxed into being something he wasn't. Playing as a central midfielder, his game explored into life.\n\nHis natural attributes took centre stage; power, intensity and an appetite for the fight. He became a midfielder opponents would often dread with a relentless to press, a fearlessness in tackling and a goalscoring touch that had, seasons prior, dispossessed him.\n\nSt. James' Park took notice. He was a symbol of Newcastle's new identity. Aggressive. Unmissable. Undeniable.\n\n\"The hard work and the trust in myself, being confident in my own ability, has played a big part in where I am today,\" the eight-time Brazil international explained. \"I tried to give my best for the club and represent them in the best possible way. Of course, there were games where it didn't work or I played at my best level but I always tried to give my all.\n\n\"Whenever you have challenges, you grow as a man. I grew as a player as well and that was important. It makes you feel stronger when you overcome them. If you work hard, something good will come your way. That's what I've always believed.\n\n\"The club has grown so much from the time I joined to where it is today. To be part of it is a great feeling and makes me very proud.\"\n\nInto his seventh season with the Magpies, a number of personal achievements have stacked up since arriving from TSG Hoffenheim as a 22-year-old.\n\nAnd then the ultimate collective triumph; lifting last season's Carabao Cup. Joelinton, arguably the symbol of a faltering era, had transformed in a central figure to end decades of waiting.\n\nHe added: \"Winning the (Carabao Cup) final and the club's first title for so many years has to be the number one moment. It's going to be in the club's history forever. You then had the parade and seeing all the fans celebrating and enjoying the moment.\n\n\"I've had many games too, scoring on my 100th Premier League appearance (a brace in a 3-0 win against Norwich City during the 2021/22 campaign) and my 200th Premier League appearance (in last month's 3-1 win at Burnley).\n\n\"There is also my first goal for the club against Tottenham. I have memories that will live with me forever.\"\n\nIf the groin injury sustained in last weekend's 2-0 defeat against Aston Villa felt like misfortune, it also felt fitting to some extent. Joelinton's Newcastle story has been defied by physical commitment, emptying the tank for the shirt when his body eventually said no more. Milestones, for him, have rarely come without scars.\n\nThe drive and hunger for success remains as evident as when the Brazilian first stepped foot on Tyneside and, after helping the club end a 70-year wait for a domestic trophy, has his sights set on future silverware.\n\n\"I want to win more trophies at Newcastle,\" he added. \"That's my goal and dreams. It was a great feeling to win the Carabao Cup last season but now we want more and I want to put my name in the history of the club, helping them to grow and become one of the best teams in the world.\n\n\"I came here very young. Now, I'm almost 30 and many things have happened during my time here. I've received two more kids - my daughter was born here - so the club have given me so much.\n\n\"I love the club and I hope I can keep doing well. My wife has been very important to me, being with me in both the good and bad moments. She's my best friend.\n\n\"The gaffer has helped me a lot since he joined the club. He switched my position and has helped me grow as a player and person. I'm very grateful for everything he has done for me. He's someone I really respect, someone I love and will always be thankful for.\"\n\nJoelinton's legacy is already secure. Not because of numbers alone but because of what he represents. Resilience, reinvention and relentless commitment to finding belonging, in black and white, along the way.",

    "fullText": "The 2000s brought about a new archetype of character into pop culture: the “anti-hero.” Exemplified on television with the likes of Walter White and Tony Soprano, the anti-hero is a character who is by no means evil, but often has to do bad things as a means to an end.\n\nIn College Basketball, we’ve seen our share of heroes and villains through the years (here’s looking at you, Grayson Allen). But Charles Bediako, in the year 2025, is the exact anti-hero that the sport needs. His situation should bring about the necessary change that can save college basketball.\n\nIf the name Charles Bediako sounded familiar before he made national headlines this week, it’s because he was the starting center for Alabama in the 2022-2023 season. This team was notable not just because they were the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, but also because they had an active team member commit a murder midseason\n\nThey also had a star player and future top-5 NBA draft pick, Brandon Miller, who faced scrutiny over how involved he was in the said murder, in which he would eventually face no charges. That Alabama team was a national story every week that season.\n\nAfter the season ended, Bediako declared for the NBA draft, forgoing his remaining college eligibility. He would then play two full seasons in the G-League, never once getting called up to play in the NBA. And now, with the lines more blurred than ever in terms of what is allowed or not allowed in college basketball, he’s back playing for the Crimson Tide.\n\nWhile the NCAA has officially ruled him ineligible to continue to play college basketball, Bediako got a temporary restraining order from an Alabama judge (who happens to have ties to the program), allowing him to play games in the state of Alabama. Bediako shined in Alabama’s loss to Tennessee on Saturday, scoring 13 points in 25 minutes off the bench.\n\nIf it sounds villainous for someone to go behind the NCAA’s back to try to allow themselves to play in a sport that they left almost three years ago, that’s what makes Bediako the perfect anti-hero. No one can put individual blame on Bediako or on coach Nate Oats for this particular situation. Nate Oats’s career is defined by winning basketball games. And if Bediako can help him win, of course, he’s going to fight to get him back on the roster.\n\nFor Bediako, his goal is to continue to play basketball for as long as he can and make as much money as he can while doing it. So, if he’s not going to get called up to the NBA, and his G-League timer is not getting any longer, why not explore this option of getting to play again at Alabama? You simply can’t blame either Bediako or Oats for this predicament — they’re behaving rationally in their own self-interests.\n\nInstead, blame the NCAA. The NIL era has allowed “the line” to continue to change. What do I mean when I say “the line”? The line is the thing that, once a player crosses, he can no longer come back to college basketball. The line simply used to be “declare for the NBA draft.”\n\nThen it moved to “declare for the draft and hire an agent.” When NIL made agents more commonplace, it then became “play in a professional, pay-to-play” basketball league. But then, players like Creighton’s Fedor Zugic, who had played professionally in Europe, began to challenge this convention.\n\nThen, you have Baylor’s James Nnaji, who was drafted by the NBA but played professionally overseas, being allowed to play college basketball this season. What makes the Bediako situation even more interesting is that Abdullah Ahmed, a player who played in the G-League before ever playing college basketball, is being allowed to play for BYU this season.\n\nSo, I say all of this to say, where is “the line”? And has Bediako crossed it? The Bediako situation is so unique and represents such a unique series of events that it is going to force the NCAA into redefining where the line is and creating a uniform, inarguable policy that will make these situations much more black and white in the future, instead of living in the gray area of temporary restraining orders and court cases.\n\nThat would bring about a positive change to the sport in the long run, which would make Bediako the ultimate anti-hero. Not unlike how Ed O’Bannon became the face of the early NIL movement, Bediako can become the face of the line between professional and college basketball.\n\nCheck out all of our NFL articles: https://www.thebiglead.com/category/nfl/\n\nThe post One of College Basketball’s most controversial decisions has a new twist  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Despite mutual desire, Jaquan Brisker's market value could price him out of Chicago, signaling a potential departure from the Bears' secondary.",
    "fullText": "The offseason brings contract decisions for the Chicago Bears to make.\n\nMultiple key players are set to become free agents without a new contract. Two of the bigger names among the Chicago players whose contracts expired are Jaquan Brisker and Kevin Byard.\n\nBrisker and Byard have already made their intentions known when it comes to re-signing with the franchise. The safeties want to be Bears for the foreseeable future.\n\nGeneral Manager Ryan Poles has also spoken about the possibility of bringing both players back. The Bears selected the safety in the 2022 NFL Draft out of Penn State.\n\nBrisker just had 93 total tackles, one sack, one interception and one TFL this past season. Even though both parties clearly want him to return to the Bears, Brisker's market value may be too much for Chicago to re-sign him.\n\nESPN's Dan Graziano believes an extension may not be in the cards for the former second-round pick.\n\n“The 2022 second-round pick still doesn’t have an extension, which isn’t the best sign in terms of his future with a team that has a ton of offseason decisions to make,\" Graziano said. \"It sounds to me as if Brisker will have an outside market that prices him out of Chicago.”\n\nBringing Brisker wouldn't hurt with how inconsistent the secondary was for Chicago at times in 2025. The Bears allowed the 11th-most passing yards per game (239.4).\n\nThe secondary was also decimated with injuries for considerable amounts of time. Kyler Gordon had hamstring, groin and calf injuries take up most of the year for him. Jaylon Johnson suffered a groin injury in Week 2 and didn't return until Week 13.\n\nC.J. Gardner-Johnson was signed by Chicago to play nickel corner with Gordon's injuries, but he is now a free agent. Nahshon Wright is also hitting the free agent market this offseason.\n\nAside from the secondary, players like Olamide Zaccheaus, Braxton Jones, Theo Benedet and Andrew Billings are out of contracts.\n\nThe Bears will have to decide on left tackle, too.\n\nOzzy Trapilo's patellar injury could not be healed until late in the 2026 season, via Poles. Jones or Benedet could be re-signed, but Chicago may need to bring in a veteran short-term until Trapilo can play.\n\nThe Bears are also preparing for the 2026 NFL Draft, which is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It will be held from April 23-25, with the Bears holding the 25th overall pick.",

    "fullText": "The Montreal Canadiens hoped that bringing Jacob Fowler up and sending Samuel Montembeault down to the AHL for a conditioning stint would sort out their goaltending issues, and for a time, it looked like it might have worked. Still, the wheels are starting to come off the wagon again.\n\nAfter the Habs’ heartbreaking loss to the Boston Bruins, Martin St-Louis was asked whether he felt Montembeault was again fragile, and he replied:\n\nNo, no, I don’t think so. Listen, the last goal, the puck’s direction changes…No, I don’t think so.\n\n- St-Louis on whether Montembeault seemed fragile lately\n\nWhile the puck might have changed direction, the cold, hard facts remain: the coach decided to use Montembeault for two crucial divisional matchups in a row, and in both games, his save percentage was below .815. Whatever the context, that number is just not good enough. On the season, the Becancour native has a 9-8-2 record with a 3.46 GAA and a .869 save percentage.\n\nCanadiens' Kent Hughes Won’t Go Into The Deadline Guns Blazing\nCanadiens Lose In Heartbreaking Fashion\nCanadiens: Injury Bug Bites Reinbacher Again\n\nWhile Jakub Dobes’ numbers aren’t exactly brilliant either ( 3.01 GAA and a .887 SV), the Czech netminder at least has a winning record, and it’s not even close. He’s 15-5-3 on the season. Whatever the reason is, the Habs seem to give Dobes more offensive support than Montembeault, and that plays into it as well.\n\nWhen Kent Hughes met the media for his mid-season review, he said he didn’t like to put labels on people and that the goaltender playing the best would play the most, but that’s not what’s happening right now. Dobes has a 5-0-1 record in his last six games, while Montembeault is now 1-2-1 in his previous four starts.\n\nThe Canadiens have three games this week, they’ll take on the Vegas Golden Knights, the Colorado Avalanche, and the Buffalo Sabres. To win, they will need someone to stand up and make the saves, and right now, it doesn’t look like that someone can be Montembeault.\n\nFollow Karine on X @KarineHains Bluesky @karinehains.bsky.social and Threads @karinehains.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Canadiens' page for all the news and happenings around the Canadiens.\n\nJoin the discussion by signing up to the Canadiens' roundtable on The Hockey News.\n\ncom/free.

    "fullText": "Super Bowl 60 is poised to deliver a compelling rematch as the New England Patriots prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe highly anticipated clash, featuring two formidable defences, a second-year head coach against a seasoned veteran, and a pair of quarterbacks with contrasting journeys, is scheduled for 8 February at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nThe Patriots, led by quarterback Drake Maye and coach Mike Vrabel, are making their first Super Bowl appearance since Tom Brady and Bill Belichick secured their sixth championship seven years ago.\n\nNew England, now seeking a record seventh Super Bowl victory, earned their spot by defeating the Denver Broncos 10-7 in the AFC Championship game, marking their 12th trip to the NFL’s showpiece event.\n\nMaye, a finalist for AP NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year, scored a crucial 6-yard touchdown run in Denver after a critical turnover by Jarrett Stidham.\n\nDespite playing through a snowstorm, Maye managed 86 passing yards and 65 rushing yards. \"The Pats are back, baby,\" Maye declared. \"Now, gotta win one.\"\n\nOn the opposing side, Sam Darnold, now with his fifth team, has guided the Seahawks to their fourth Super Bowl appearance, as they chase their second Lombardi Trophy.\n\nUnder coach Mike Macdonald, Seattle secured their place with a 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC title game. Darnold delivered one of his finest performances, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns without a single turnover.\n\nAddressing his critics, Darnold stated: \"That doesn’t matter to me. I just come to work every single day with these guys. These guys in the locker room, that’s what it’s about to me, man. The way we’ve come to work ever since April in OTAs, training camp, one day at a time and we’re here. We did it.\"\n\nThis upcoming Super Bowl revives memories of an unforgettable climax 11 years ago, when Brady’s Patriots overcame Russell Wilson’s Seahawks 28-24.\n\nThat game, on 1 February 2015, saw Brady throw four touchdown passes, rallying New England from a 10-point deficit, before Malcolm Butler’s iconic interception at the 1-yard line sealed the victory.\n\nSeattle fans still debate the decision not to hand the ball to Marshawn Lynch in that pivotal moment.\n\nVrabel, who won three Super Bowls as a Patriots linebacker in the 2000s, has orchestrated a remarkable turnaround, transforming the team from a 4-13 record last year to 14-3 this season.\n\nHe aims to become the first person to win a Super Bowl as both a player and head coach for the same franchise. \"I can’t tell you how proud I am to be associated with these guys and this organisation,\" said Vrabel, a finalist for AP NFL Coach of the Year.\n\n\"I won’t win it. It’ll be the players that’ll win the game, I promise you. It won’t be me that’ll win it and I promise you I’ll do everything that I can and our staff to have them ready for the game.\"\n\nMacdonald, meanwhile, reflected on his team’s journey: \"We did not care,\" he said about being underdogs. \"It’s about us. It’s always been about us and what we do and now we’re going to the Super Bowl.\"\n\nMaye, at 23, will become the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl, behind only Dan Marino, and the fourth second-year quarterback in the past seven years to lead his team to the final.\n\nThe Patriots, with a 6-5 record in Super Bowls, are tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most victories.\n\nTheir return to the top follows a challenging period, with only one winning season after Brady's departure in 2020.\n\nNew England's playoff run has been characterised by a potent defence, allowing just 26 points across three games, an average of 8.7 points per game – a feat only surpassed by the 2000 Ravens in the lead-up to a Super Bowl.\n\nTheir offence, however, has averaged just 18 points per game, the fewest by any Super Bowl bound team since the 1979 Rams.\n\nFrom news to politics, travel to sport, culture to climate – The Independent has a host of free newsletters to suit your interests.

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Chefs have announced their special team awards for the 2025 season. Patrick Mahomes was awarded the prestigious Derrick Thomas Team MVP Award for his efforts on and off the field to lead the team.\n\nDuring a challenging season, Mahomes remained a constant professional, keeping optimism within the team.\n\n\"I mean, our ceiling is playing in the Super Bowl. We've got all the same guys, and we added players. But at the end of the day, you've got to go out and do it on a week-in, week-out basis,\" said Mahomes after the Week 13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, \"We can beat anybody, but we've shown that we can lose to anybody. So, we've got to be more consistent. It starts with me being consistent throughout the entire game, not in just big moments.\"\n\nThis year's team MVP goes to @PatrickMahomes! pic.twitter.com/1Biin6IJ7M\n\n— Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) January 24, 2026\n\nMahomes had another strong season with 4,009 total yards split between 3,587 passing and 422 rushing. He also contributed 27 total touchdowns, 22 passing, and 5 rushing. The two-time league MVP was named as an alternate for the 2026 Pro Bowl Games, although he wouldn't be available due to knee surgery.\n\nAll of these awards were voted on by the players themselves, reflecting the locker room's true feelings about their starting quarterback.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes wins 2025 Derrick Thomas Team MVP Award",

    "description": "The Broncos' season is over. Here are the studs and duds from Sunday's loss in the AFC title game.",
    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos finished a remarkable season, and almost fittingly, their season ends in a one-score game, a 10-7 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday.\n\nThe Broncos fought well, but were ultimately unable to pull out a win and go to the Super Bowl. There is a silver lining: Denver has proven itself to be a championship contender going forward.\n\nWe take a look at the studs and duds from the loss.\n\nMarvin Mims was on the receiving end of the biggest pass play of the day for the Broncos. It set up Denver's only touchdown of the day, and he led the Broncos in receiving yards (62). Denver needs to find a way to get Mims the ball more often in 2026. He is so explosive.\n\nThe Broncos' rushing attack was nearly non-existent. Without the dynamic J.K. Dobbins, and the limited production from every other running back in the backfield, Denver was rendered one-dimensional, limited to the pass.\n\nVance Joseph and the defense pitched one heck of a game. One of the turning points came when the Patriots had a first-and-goal inside the five-yard line, and the defense forced a field goal; unfortunately, that ended up being the difference in the game.\n\nThe special teams unit, which had been so special to this point in the season, came up short when they were needed most. At the end of the first half, Lutz missed a kick that would have made it 10-7 in favor of Denver. In the second half, Lutz had a kick tipped at the line, which would have tied it at 10-10. After the game, Lutz said he'd never kicked in those conditions. Before next season, you better believe Lutz may get some snow practice in.\n\nAt the beginning of the season, could you imagine the Broncos being here? Denver went 14-3, secured the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and hosted two home playoff games. Personally, I expected Denver to be in the neighborhood of 11-12 wins, compete for the AFC West and maybe host a home playoff game. Denver knocked off the Buffalo Bills at home, and were one of the four best teams left in the playoffs. A valiant effort in the playoffs came up *this* short. Denver has now just begun their playoff window. They are now fully free from the horrendous Russell Wilson contract, and will have room to work with to sign free agents. This team was a special one. Now, it's onto 2026.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: Denver Broncos: Studs and duds from AFC Championship loss vs. Patriots",

    "fullText": "The New York Giantsare hiring Dennard Wilson as their new defensive coordinator under head coach John Harbaugh.\n\nThe 43-year-old Wilson most recently served as the Tennessee Titans' defensive coordinator, where he guided the unit to a No. 2 ranking in total defense (311.2 yards per game) and passing defense (177.3 ypg) in his debut play-calling season -- marks not seen since 2000.\n\nA former Ravens defensive backs coach under Harbaugh, Wilson brings proven secondary expertise and schematic discipline to a Giants defense that struggled mightily last year.

    "title": "‘Data is not steroids’: Why were Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz banned from wearing fitness trackers at Australian Open?",
    "description": "Sinner, Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka have been caught wearing fitness trackers during their matches at the Australian Open",
    "fullText": "An argument over banned “wearable” devices such as Whoop fitness trackers has erupted at the Australian Open after top players Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Aryna Sabalenka were ordered to remove them before their matches.\n\nTennis Australia, the organiser of the Australian Open, confirmed that the wearable wrist technology is not permitted at the grand slams – although it said that the tournament is “in discussions” over allowing such devices in the future.\n\nWearable technology is permitted on the ATP and WTA tours. When the ATP Tour announced the approval of in-match wearable devices in 2024, a statement from then chief sporting officer Ross Hutchins said the technology was a “big step forward in our push to optimise player performance and prevent injury”.\n\nSinner was ordered to remove a Whoop device, which was hidden underneath his wristband, before his fourth-round match against Luciano Darderi on Monday.\n\nThe previous day, Alcaraz was also stopped from wearing a Whoop device by a tournament official after it was spotted mid-match. Sabalenka had hers removed earlier in the tournament.\n\nIn other elite high-intensity sports, such as football and rugby union, data and fitness tracking are used to identify when players are in the “red zone” and could be more susceptible to injury without sufficient recovery.\n\nWearable devices such as the screenless Whoop sensor track biometric data and motion. The technology is designed to be worn on the wrist, or other supported positions, such as around the chest, during training, competition, and recovery.\n\nAccording to a description of the product, the data it provides includes heart rate, heart rate variability, recovery, activity strain, blood oxygenation, skin temperature, respiratory rate and blood pressure, as well as sleep stages and performance. This data can then be synced via Bluetooth and read by a coach using a paired mobile device.\n\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) approved the Whoop device following a review last December as long as haptic feedback, such as vibrations on the wrist, is disabled during competition. In-match wearable technology has been approved by the WTA since 2021 and the ATP since 2024.\n\nThere are different rules at the grand slams, however, with Tennis Australia also pointing to the fact that the tournament uses high-tech cameras to provide players with data such as distance covered, changes of direction and sprints to measure load. The tournament has an existing partnership with Bolt 6, which operates the Electronic Line Calling system using ball-tracking technology.\n\n“Wearables are currently not permitted at Grand Slams,” a Tennis Australia spokesperson said. “The Australian Open is involved in ongoing discussions on how this situation could change.”\n\nThere is an argument that elite players with greater resources could have an unfair advantage if they have access to live in-match data and their opponent does not.\n\nBefore in-match coaching was approved a few years ago (coaching is now fully embraced by the Australian Open with separate coaching pods), tennis would pride itself on the players having to work out problems for themselves once they stepped onto the court.\n\nAryna Sabalenka is a Whoop ambassador and explained how she used the technology to assist her recovery during her US Open title run in 2024. In a video published by the WTA, she explained that the Whoop band monitored her stress levels between matches and the data advised her to take days off after it found she was in the “red zone”.\n\nJannik Sinner, who struggled with the extreme heat during his third-round win, said he was planning to use the technology not for in-match use but to inform his recovery before the quarter-finals.\n\n“There is certain data what we would like to track a little bit on court,” Sinner said. “It’s not for the live thing. It’s more about [what] you can see after the match. These are datas what we would like to use also in practice sessions, because from that you can practice on with the heart rate, how much calories you burn, all these kind of things.”\n\nA Whoop spokesperson said: “Whoop believes athletes have a fundamental right to understand their own performance and health – including during competition at events like the Australian Open.\n\n“Whoop is approved by the International Tennis Federation for in-match wear and poses no safety, fairness, or competitive risk. Blocking access to personal health data does not protect sport. Whoop will continue to stand with athletes and our members to defend their right to their data.”\n\nAfter Carlos Alcaraz was caught wearing the technology under his wristband on Sunday, the Whoop founder and CEO Will Ahmed posted on X (Twitter): “Ridiculous. Whoop is approved by the International Tennis Federation for in-match wear and poses no safety risk. Let the athletes measure their bodies. Data is not steroids!”\n\nThis is unclear. After his fourth-round win, the defending champion said: “The umpire asked me straightaway, if this is the tracker. I said yes. He said remove. It’s fine. There are other things we could use. The vest [with tracker inside]. But it’s a bit for me uncomfortable. You feel like you have something on the shoulders. It’s a bit different. But rules are rules. I understand. I won’t use it again.”",

    "fullText": "Arsenal suffered their first home defeat of the season on Sunday, losing 3-2 to Manchester United to end a six-game unbeaten run in the Premier League against the away side.\n\nThe last time Arsenal had lost a league game at home to United was in 2017, with Arsene Wenger still managing the club.\n\nMore importantly, with Arsenal seeing their lead at the top of the Premier League table cut to four points, the loss allowed Manchester City and even Aston Villa back into the title race.\n\nArsenal’s strong recent record against United and the importance of picking up three points understandably led to frustration in the crowd when the game slipped away from the team. Yet some have since apportioned blame to the supporters for the ‘nervous energy’ transmitted to the team.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the game, Mikel Arteta was asked whether he believes there was nervousness in the ground.\n\n“We have to understand that we all want to win and the crowd is trying to be behind the team to make the best decisions and to win the game and we need to go through that,” Arteta responded.\n\n“We know that we were below par, especially in certain individual standards and when that happens the margin becomes very, very close and today [United] made those margins bigger because the individual quality that they have made the difference in the game.”\n\nWhen pushed on rumblings of discontent following the result, Arteta was clear that it’s normal for a club with high expectations.\n\n“That’s part of the demands and expectations that we want to win and that’s it, and individually everybody can react in the manner that they need,” Arteta said.\n\n“It doesn’t matter, we have to do more so maybe that’s not enough and we have to do more, there is nothing else.\n\n“We have to do our very best, when you do that you can rest in peace, and today we really certainly tried to do our very best, but we weren’t efficient enough against a team that is very well organised and we got punished because of our own mistakes as well.”\n\nThe reality is that those mistakes that Arteta refers to happened largely when the fans were on side and supportive.\n\nThere wouldn’t have been a single fan complaining in the lead up to Martin Zubimendi assisting Bryan Mbeumo’s goal. Everyone would have been delighted and enjoying the lead before the error itself.\n\nSimilarly, everyone was in good spirits, urging the team on and singing Mikel Merino’s song when the team opened up and allowed Matheus Cunha a free shot at goal for United’s winner.\n\nIt’s true that the fans can put more pressure on the players at times, but for a team that wants to win trophies there’s no excusing the way Arsenal played, nor the fact it’s now three Premier League games without a win. No one is going to hold your hand over the finish line.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal icon Patrick Vieira believes one Manchester United player is reaping the rewards of Michael Carrick’s tactics more than Bryan Mbeumo, especially after Sunday’s result.\n\nDuring his punditry duties for Sky Sports, Patrick Vieira watched as his former club Arsenal fell to Manchester United in a 3-2 defeat at the Emirates.\n\nMichael Carrick has now overseen impressive back-to-back Premier League wins over top-two sides Arsenal and Manchester City since taking charge.\n\nBryan Mbeumo was once again trusted to lead the line for Man Utd under Carrick’s system, and the summer signing from Brentford delivered another strong performance.\n\nMbeumo pulled Man Utd level before half-time when he capitalised on a costly mistake from Arsenal’s Martin Zubimendi.\n\nAfter Bryan Mbeumo pulled Manchester United level, Patrick Dorgu put them in front early in the second half. It was a well-taken goal that gave United some momentum coming out of the break.\n\nMikel Merino equalised for Arsenal late on, just when it looked like United might hold on. But even with time running out, there was still more to come.\n\nMatheus Cunha replaced Bryan Mbeumo in the second half and the 26-year-old Brazilian forward scored the winner for Man Utd in Sunday evening’s result.\n\nFollowing Manchester United’s 2-0 victory against Manchester City at Old Trafford last week, Vieira believed that Carrick and his colleagues had finally “answered” the significant questions surrounding them.\n\n“There were still big questions after City,” he told Sky Sports.\n\n“They answered them so well. They are back on track. There’s still a long way to go. Wins against City and Arsenal is so good for confidence.”\n\nPlaying in the No 10 role behind Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes featured there for the second straight Premier League match under interim boss Carrick.\n\nThe Manchester United captain’s performances against both City and Arsenal have drawn high praise from Vieira.\n\n“The system allowed them to express themselves,” the Frenchman stated.\n\n“I think the 4-2-3-1 allowed Fernandes to be a little bit more free on the pitch, create situations, score goals.\n\n“You can see the pictures – the smile is back on the face of the United players.”\n\nUnder Ruben Amorim last season, Fernandes often played deeper before the manager was dismissed earlier this month. The coaching change has clearly had an impact on his play.",

    "fullText": "A beaming Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s delight was unmistakable as Manchester United sealed a thrilling 3–2 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates\n\nUnited headed into the Arsenal with plenty of confidence from their previous game, a dominant 2-0 win against Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City.\n\nUnited, however, had to survive an early onslaught as Arsenal controlled the ball and penned them back from the start. The Gunners deservedly broke the deadlock in the 29th minute. However, Bryan Mbeumo capitalised on a massive error from Martin Zubimendi to restore parity soon after.\n\nMichael Carrick’s men took the lead when Patrick Dorgu played a slick one-two with Bruno Fernandes before lashing the ball home from beneath the crossbar.\n\nMikel Merino came on from the bench and prodded home from a scruffy corner-kick routine to make it 2-2.\n\nMatheus Cunha had the final say, producing a moment of magic late on to clinch the win for United and another landmark victory for Carrick.\n\nSpeaking after the final whistle, Carrick praised his squad’s collective spirit and their rapid assimilation of the coaching staff’s tactical instructions.\n\nThe former United man has implemented a dynamic style of play, with the side now attacking with fluidity and defending with aggressive intensity off the ball. Assistant coach Steve Holland has been widely credited for his pivotal role in this tactical transformation.\n\nPresent at the Emirates was co-owner Ratcliffe, who sat next to chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.\n\nAs he departed the stadium post-match, Ratcliffe’s face was a picture of pure elation, beaming with uncontainable joy.\n\nThe INEOS billionaire was asked if he could speak to journalists. He answered, “No, no, no.”\n\nHe added, “Just get the smile”, while gesturing that his lips were sealed.\n\nAsked whether he was happy with the win, Ratcliffe responded in just two words, “Very, yeah.”\n\nRatcliffe’s reaction marks a remarkable turnaround from him, having insisted earlier in the season that Ruben Amorim would not be sacked and would be afforded a minimum of three years to get it right.\n\nWhile Amorim’s stubborn adherence to a controversial 3-4-3 system yielded poor results, Carrick has achieved a staggering change with the same group of players. The scale of this turnaround explains Ratcliffe’s massive grin at full-time.\n\nFeatured image Michael Regan via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "New England’s improbable turnaround from division basement dweller to championship contender came full circle Sunday when the Patriots eked out a 10-7 win in the AFC Championship to book their first trip to the Super Bowl since the days of Belichick and Brady.\n\nThey will have to beat the odds once again to hoist the franchise’s seventh Lombardi Trophy in two weeks.\n\nAlthough the Patriots and Seahawks finished with identical 14-3 records, New England’s Super Bowl XLIX foe is favored across most sportsbooks.\n\nDraftKings Sportsbook: Seahawks -3.5 | 46.5\n\nFanDuel Sportsbook: Seahawks -4.5 | 46.5\n\nBetMGM Sportsbook: Seahawks -5 | 46.5\n\nBarring a dramatic odds swing over the next few weeks, Super Bowl LX will be the first time this postseason that the Patriots will enter the game as underdogs afte being favorites in their Wild Card victory over the Los Angeles Chargers, Divisional Round Victory over the Houston Texans and championship victory over the Denver Broncos.\n\nSeattle has also been favored throughout their postseason run but dodged playing in the Wild Card round by securing the NFC’s top seed.\n\nSeattle has won nine games in a row and 13 of their last 14. Coach Mike Macdonald’s suffocating defense allowed the fewest points in the NFL during the regular season and their offense, led by 28-year-old QB Sam Darnold, doesn’t lag far behind, scoring the third most points in the league.\n\nWhile Patriots fans might remember Darnold from his infamous “I’m seeing ghosts” moment on Monday Night Football in 2019, the former Jets quarterback has transformed himself into a legitimate leading man as he completed 67.7 percent of his passes for 4,048 yards, 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions during the regular season. He has yet to throw a postseason interception.\n\nPatriots QB Drake Maye led the league with a 72% completion percentage in the regular season but New England’s offense has gotten bogged down in their three postseason games against three high-powered defenses as the sophomore QB has taken 15 sacks, fumbled six times (losing three) and tossed two INTs.\n\nFirst-year head coach Mike Vrabel has had the Patriots’ defense playing with fire, as the former New England LB has overhauled a group that ranked near the bottom of the league last year into a unit that has averaged less than 9 points per game allowed in the playoffs.\n\nSuper Bowl LX is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET on February 8.\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "A few days ago, reports emerged suggesting that Barcelona were closely monitoring the situation of highly-rated Benfica right-back Daniel Banjaqui, one of the club’s most exciting young prospects.\n\nThe 17-year-old only made his senior debut this season, but his rapid rise has already drawn attention from some of Europe’s biggest clubs.\n\nBarcelona’s interest is easy to understand, as the right-back position at the club has lacked long-term stability for years.\n\nDespite multiple investments and short-term fixes, Barça have struggled to find a player who can fully establish himself in the role and offer sustained competition to Jules Kounde.\n\nThe recent arrival of Joao Cancelo has helped ease the situation, but the club see that move as temporary rather than a lasting solution.\n\nAs a result, Barcelona continue to scan the market for young, high-upside talent, which is where Banjaqui’s name entered the conversation.\n\nAs such, Barcelona’s hopes of securing the teenage defender now appear to be fading.\n\nAccording to SPORT, Benfica are determined to keep hold of one of their brightest academy products.\n\nIn fact, the report claims that Benfica manager Jose Mourinho, under whom Banjaqui made his senior debut, has made it clear that he does not want to lose the youngster.\n\nIt is said that Benfica have been working for months on renewing Banjaqui’s contract and strengthening his ties to the club.\n\nWhile talks have not yet been finalised, the ongoing discussions have only increased speculation around his future, rather than calming it.\n\nThat said, Mourinho’s personal involvement appears to have shifted the balance.\n\nThe Portuguese coach is believed to have earned Banjaqui’s trust and played a decisive role in discouraging a move to Barcelona, as well as interest from several Premier League clubs.",

    "description": "RAGBRAI is the world's oldest, longest annual bicycle tour. Here's what to know about the 53rd annual edition July 19-25.",
    "fullText": "RAGBRAI 2026 will take riders on a scenic journey this summer from the Loess Hills overlooking the Missouri River in northwest Iowa through the plains of central Iowa to the Mississippi River on the state's eastern boundary.\n\nThe route for the 53rd edition of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, announced on Saturday, Jan. 24, will extend 391.4 miles from Onawa to Dubuque. Along the way the seven-day bike tour will stop overnight in Harlan, Guthrie Center, Boone, Marshalltown, Independence and Dyersville.\n\nIt will be the shortest RAGBRAI ever, but will be hillier than all but nine other editions.\n\n“The mileage is not as intense as it’s been in years past,” RAGBRAI Director Matt Phippen said. \"What they can’t always plan for is the elevation.”\n\nHere is what to know about RAGBRAI 2026.\n\nThe world’s longest and oldest annual bicycle tour, RAGBRAI draws tens of thousands of participants from around the world. Spanning the final full week of July, it always goes from west to east across Iowa.\n\nThe ride begins at or near the Missouri River and ends at the Mississippi, taking advantage of the fact that Iowa is bordered by the nation's two longest rivers. The events division of USA Today Co., the corporate parent of the Des Moines Register, runs the ride.\n\nRAGBRAI evolved from an idea hatched by riding buddies Donald Kaul, the Des Moines Register's Washington columnist, and copy editor and features writer John Karras. They called the 460-mile cross-state ride from Sioux City to Davenport the Great Six-Day Bike Trip.\n\nAt his editor's behest, Karras invited readers along. When Kaul and Karras arrived in Sioux City on Aug. 26, 1973, to start the ride, there were about 200 cyclists waiting for them.\n\nThey wrote stories along the way about the people they met and sights they saw in small towns across Iowa. Readers were enthralled with tales of the ride and characters like Clarence Pickard, a pith-helmeted, 83-year-old retired farmer from Indianola who rode the entire way on a used women's bicycle he bought just before the ride.\n\nMore: As RAGBRAI grows from lark to legendary at age 50, it still offers glimpses of 'authentic Iowa'\n\nThe Second Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, or SAGBRAI, followed in 1974. Karras renamed it the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa in 1975. Later, its date shifted permanently to the last full week of July each year, adding a seventh day.\n\nSince then, RAGBRAI has grown into a professionally managed event that draws riders from all 50 states and as far away as Australia and South Africa. During its 50th anniversary edition in 2023, some 60,000 riders crowded onto the Day 4 ride from Ames to Des Moines.\n\nRAGBRAI will be held Sunday to Saturday July 19-25. Most riders add an extra night, gathering in the starting town the Saturday before the ride begins for an early start the following morning. Colloquially known as \"Day 0,\" this year's will be July 18 and the town will be Onawa, which will mark the event with a daylong festival and bike expo.\n\nThis year's ride will cover 391.4 miles, making it the shortest RAGBRAI to date. The previous shortest edition came in 1977 with a 400-mile journey from Onawa to Lansing. Over the preceding 52 years, routes have averaged about 470 miles, according to RAGBRAI. On six occasions, including as recently as 2023, the route was more than 500 miles long.\n\nOrganizers will continue to change the route until after the annual Route Inspection Ride in June. Natural disasters like flooding and tornadoes, as well as road construction, can force organizers to make alterations.\n\nRAGBRAI 2026 will travel from Onawa in northwest Iowa to Dubuque in northeast Iowa. There will be 16,027 feet of climb, the 10th-most of any RAGBRAI, according to the organizers.\n\nNo matter what route the ride takes, there are some serious hills, especially coming in and out of river valleys. In some years, like the hilliest-ever RAGBRAI in 2024, the hills never end. In 2026 the first and second days are short in mileage but will be the hilliest.\n\nThe first day packs 3,465 feet of climb into 58.5 miles as it climbs through the Loess Hills. The second day will be the hilliest of the week with 3,554 feet of climb crammed into just 53.9 miles.\n\n“They’re so unique,” Phippen said of the Loess. “When you’re riding your bike in that area it doesn’t feel like Iowa. It doesn’t look like Iowa. … It’s another view of what Iowa has to offer.”\n\nThere also is the possibility that RAGBRAI will pass by Pilot Mound, setting up a steep drop into the Des Moines River valley near Boone, the Day 3 overnight town, and then a notorious climb back out. The final route has not been determined.\n\nOn paper the 81.4-mile fifth day from Marshalltown to Independence appears to be the hardest because it is 19 miles longer than any other day and has the third-most feet of climb.\n\nBut the hilly first and second days also could be challenging. As always, weather will play a large role in determining which days are the toughest because headwinds, heat or rain can make any day more challenging.\n\n“You have days in the 60s (miles) and you have 1,500 feet of climb, so just a normal day of riding anywhere in Iowa. But, you throw in headwinds, and that day is super hard now,” Phippen said. “Unless Mother Nature blesses us with tailwinds every day, that’s the only possible way we have easy days on RAGBRAI.”\n\nRegistration opened Nov. 15. Weeklong passes cost $250 until Feb. 28. Beginning March 1, weeklong prices increase, peaking at $400 beginning June 1. Single-day passes also are available for $45 until Feb. 28. They will cost more thereafter, reaching $70 when bought during the ride at the RAGBRAI campgrounds.\n\nWeeklong nonrider passes for support drivers and others tagging along will cost $45 until the end of February and $50 after March 1.\n\nRegistration is required for all vehicles entering RAGBRAI campgrounds. Weeklong vehicle passes cost:\n\n$45 for cars, SUVs, minivans and pickup trucks.\n\n$80. for box trucks and RVs up to 25 feet long and for 15-passenger vans.\n\n$100 for buses, RVs and pickup truck-trailer combos longer than 25 feet, up to a maximum of 45 feet.\n\n$120 for vehicles or truck-trailer combos over 45 feet.\n\nRegistration pays for the things that make RAGBRAI, RAGBRAI, including:\n\nFour ambulances and paramedic teams on the route each day and free emergency medical transportation.\n\nTraffic control by Iowa State Patrol troopers.\n\nFree support and gear, or SAG, service, which patrols the route to pick up riders experiencing mechanical or physical breakdowns.\n\nOfficial camping areas with portable toilets.\n\nRoute maps and GPX files for riders and support drivers\n\nDirectional marking of the bike and support vehicle routes.\n\nAn embroidered patch for weeklong riders and a century patch for those who complete the 100-mile loop.\n\nBicycle shipping stations at the end of the ride.\n\nThe opportunity to utilize long-term parking in the starting or ending town.\n\nThe overnight towns are the six where riders will spend the night as they wend their way across Iowa: Harlan, Guthrie Center, Boone, Marshalltown, Independence and Dyersville.\n\nPass-through towns are where riders can pause for breakfast, a snack or refreshment and to play games and sometimes join spontaneous dancing, goat yoga and other shenanigans as they travel between the starting, ending and overnight towns. Meeting towns are daily midpoints where riders can rendezvous with companions and support vehicles.\n\nEach year RAGBRAI has one day with an optional, added loop, providing riders who choose to take advantage of it enough distance to complete a total ride of at least 100 miles. The loop is named for RAGBRAI co-founder Karras, who died in 2021.\n\nThe optional century loop day will be announced in April, Phippen said.\n\nSince 2015, RAGBRAI has offered optional detours for gravel riders.\n\nLast year's route included daily optional gravel sections adding up to a total of 83 miles for the week. This year also will include gravel options every day. Details will be released in April, Phippen said.\n\n“We have the best gravel in the nation,” he said. “So we want to show it off. As long as it makes sense, as long as it’s safe, we’ll find more ways to add gravel.”\n\nOccasionally, the full route also has stretches of gravel due to road construction, flooding or other events. The full route in 2023 had a 2.5-mile section of gravel with two hills on it, and the 2024 route had a mile-long section.\n\nAs of January, there are no plans to take the regular route on gravel roads in 2026, Phippen said. But the final route is still being determined, he said.\n\n“If something happens throughout the year, the route does evolve, it does change,” he said.\n\nThe question of whether RAGBRAI will visit any state other than Iowa would have seemed implausible before 2025 because, after all, it is the Register's Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa. But on the second day of RAGBRAI's far northerly route last July it veered across the border for a 15-mile excursion through southern Minnesota.\n\nGiven the central Iowa route, RAGBRAI will stay solely within the confines of Iowa in 2026, Phippen said.\n\n“There’s no plans to go to any other states this year,” he said.\n\nMost riders favor road or gravel bikes, but heavier mountain bikes are far more popular than they once were. Tandems and recumbent bikes are everywhere. Each year there are more electric-assist bikes. And as always, RAGBRAI's rolling carnival attracts people on everything from high-wheeled penny-farthings to skateboards.\n\nOver its 53 years numerous celebrities and athletes have ridden RAGBRAI, from longtime Oakland Raider Ben Davidson in the 1980s to seven-time NASCAR Champion Jimmie Johnson in 2017 and \"American Pickers\" star Mike Wolfe in 2019.\n\nSome celebrities give no advance notice of their plans to participate. It was a surprise treat in 2025 when NBA hall-of-famer David Robinson joined the ride.\n\nRAGBRAI is a bike tour, not a race. It's open to riders of all ages and abilities. People can ride all seven days or just one day. Some people go for the whole week but only ride parts of each day. You win by having as much fun as you can while moving along at your own pace.\n\nRAGBRAI also asks riders to make sure everyone has a good time by respecting the residents of the towns that host them. The number of riders is often many times larger than their populations and the event is only possible because volunteers spend hundreds of hours preparing for and hosting the cyclists.\n\nPhilip Joens has ridden parts of 20 RAGBRAIs. He has completed the river-to-river trek nine times. He covers retail and real estate for the Des Moines Register and can be reached at 515-284-8184 or at pjoens@registermedia.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Des Moines Register: What to know about RAGBRAI as it prepares for 2026",

    "title": "Variable Width Font Rendering",
    "description": "Implementing variable-width font rendering for the Game Boy using GBDK-2020",
    "fullText": "To render a scene on a Game Boy or Game Boy Color, one must create a tileset of tiles of 8x8 pixels, and assign these tiles to the background. The Game Boy background is 32x32 tiles and the screen renders a 20x18 portion of it.\n\nIt therefore makes a lot of sense to render text using 1 tile per character, resulting in a fixed-width 8x8 font. Most popular games use this.\n\nMy goal is to find a way to render variable-width fonts, with the intention to render more than 20 characters on a single line. I do intend to stick to the 8 pixels vertically, but horizontally I want to “ignore” the 8-pixel grid and create a software text renderer for the Game Boy.\n\nThe first step is finding a font. I’m really lazy, so I’ll grab a free pixelated font from FontSpace.com.\n\nI like Pixel Millennium, because it has a variety of character widths, making it suitable for this demo. This font is free for personal use, and I’ve purchased a commercial license for my project.\n\nThe next step is to convert the TTF to a map of characters I can use as a basis to render the text width. My instinct tells me to render the characters as a 1-bit bitmap, where each byte represents 8 pixels of either “background color” (0, for white) and “text color” (1, for black). My bitmap should contain the width of each character.\n\nI haven’t actually checked, but I assume the smallest character is 1 pixel wide and the largest character is 5 pixels wide, so I need at least 3 bits to encode the width of a character. 3 bits nicely encodes 0 up to 7, which I expect to cover all characters. I’ll also assume a fixed height of 5 pixels for all characters.\n\nFinally, I’m going to encode all characters in a single buffer of bytes named font_data, and because they will all have different sizes, I’m going to need some kind of index. This index will mirror an ASCII table for common characters, starting at 33 (!) and ending at 126 (~), for 94 characters total. The index will contain pointers to the start of the font_data for each character.\n\nTo make the pointers work, I’m going to have to align each character in the font_data with the start of a byte, so I expect there to be some padding bits between them.\n\nTo summarize, I expect to encode the font as C code as follows:\n\nWhether this is an optimal solution, I don’t know. But I’ll find out, by doing. Let’s generate some font data by rendering the TTF to font data!\n\nThe easiest way to encode the characters to font data I can think of is by using Javascript. I can render each character onto a canvas, extract the pixels and convert them to my desired font_data and indices.\n\nFirst, I render the characters to a canvas. For some reason the font keeps rendering slightly blurry, so I’ll just render the font pretty big and query the center of “assumed pixels”. I rendered the “query pixels” green, the borders red and the font blue:\n\nTo support a variable width, height and vertical offset, I’m going to encode the width, height and vertical offset of each character. Analyzing all characters, I found that the width, height and vertical offsets all vary by at least 5, I’m going to need at least 3 bits for each value, 9 bits total. I might still pack them as 1 byte per value, depending on the size vs performance tradeoff, since extracting 3 bits from a byte is likely extra work.\n\nPacking the pixel data tightly with the 9 bits of metadata, the majority of characters will fit in 3 or 2 bytes. Since most characters are 3x5 pixels, they need 15 bits. Add 9 bits of metadata, and you get a nice round 24 bits.\n\nI suspect I’ll be needing to calculate the width of a string without actually rendering it, so I want to pack the width at the beginning for easy access.\n\nSkipping the implementation details, the result looks like this:\n\nIt compiles without error! Now let’s see if I can render the characters on a Game Boy.\n\nLet’s attempt to write the characters as tiles on a Game Boy, rendering one character per tile. I’m going to create 2 new files - font.h and font.c; These will contain functions for rendering the characters. Before I deal with the Game Boy’s native 2-bits-per-pixel encoding, I’m going to use GBDK-2020’s (Game Boy Development Kit) 1bpp to simplify the implementation, where one byte simply represents 1 row of 8 pixels, and each tile of 8x8 pixels is represented by 8 bytes.\n\nWith 1bpp, one can use the following GBDK functions to render the character:\n\nLet’s define font_render_character_1bpp, returning 0, which is the minimum definition that compiles. I am going to implement this using Test-Driven-Development:\n\nThis passes, as expected. Let’s add a test!\n\nAs expected, this fails. In TDD spirit, let’s only return the width, as that is the only thing being tested. I’m going to extend my test suite to cover all these cases, and clean up the suite a bit:\n\nNow to render the actual tiles. But first, a test! I don’t know a pretty way to test rendered graphics, but adding this after render('#') this should suffice for now:\n\nAs expected, the test fails. Now to implement the actual rendering:\n\nThis implementation is obviously not efficient, but the test does pass. Now to actually put them on the screen! Exciting stuff!\n\nIt works! With the dx & dy arguments, I can render the characters anywhere in a tile. This should make the next step easy: Variable-Width Text Rendering.\n\nFor my next function, rendering a line of text, I’m going to use a function like this:\n\nLet’s write some tests for this function:\n\nAnd here’s the result running on real hardware:\n\nThere’s lots of room for optimization and rendering of new-lines, but that’s outside the scope of this already lengthy blog.

    "title": "India–New Zealand FTA: A People-First Pact for a New Era of Trade",
    "description": "India and New Zealand have concluded a landmark free-trade agreement that prioritizes people and services alongside goods.",
    "fullText": "Even as the global trade sector has experienced an Annus Horribilis (horrible year), 2025 has been India’s year of trade acceleration. In July, New Delhi signed the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA); in December, it sealed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Oman; and now, in a record nine months, India and New Zealand have concluded their free‑trade agreement (FTA), pending legal review and formal ratification.\n\nAlongside early-harvest and launch tracks with the EU, Chile and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), plus a revived Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA) with Canada, a clear picture of India’s new trade architecture is emerging. New Delhi is building high-quality, rules-based bilateral arrangements, phased where necessary, with partners that complement, rather than compete with, India’s strengths and priorities.\n\nOn one level, the India-New Zealand FTA is a straightforward extension of this — a pragmatic deal between two economies whose bilateral trade, while steadily growing, currently stands at a minuscule $2.4 billion, thus leaving plenty of potential to unlock. On the other hand, it tells us something broader about where India is headed and how it intends to build prosperity, with people, not just products, at the center.\n\nFor decades, commentators have reduced India’s trade strategy to a binary: open the gates and risk import surges or stay cautious and forgo the scale and opportunity that the global economic order offers. That false choice collapsed when India refused to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and instead rewired its negotiating posture around complementarity.\n\nThis shift in strategy has been made possible by a wave of internal reforms that reached a new peak in 2025. Major changes, most notably the rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST) 2.0 this year, alongside other key reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tenure, including the simplification of foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, expanded production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes, digital governance improvements and the implementation of the Four Labor Codes, have all contributed to investor confidence.\n\nIt is this transformed, future-ready India that now approaches trade negotiations from a position of strength. New Zealand fits that map. It is a high-income, rules-based economy that doesn’t compete head-to-head with India in mass manufacturing; instead, it welcomes Indian services, talent and consumer goods under transparent and fair terms.\n\nThose terms are striking. New Zealand has granted zero-duty access to all Indian exports. Not “most,” not “nearly all” — all. For India’s labor-intensive sectors — textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, gems and jewelry, marine products, toys, handicrafts — this is a once-in-a-generation opening; the kind you build upon to broaden value chains. Small exporters who dreaded duties and nickel-and-diming at the border can now quote with confidence, contract with certainty, ship with speed and expand their operations thanks to cash flows freed from tariffs.\n\nIndia, for its part, has offered tariff liberalization on about 70% of tariff lines, covering 95% of bilateral trade value. This has been done through a calibrated blend of immediate cuts (sheep meat, wool, coal, most forestry and wood), phased reductions (oils, select machinery, wine) and carefully managed tariff-rate quotas for a handful of sensitive horticulture lines (honey, apples, kiwifruit).\n\nBut these concessions have been meticulously crafted to ensure that India’s most sensitive sectors remain protected. Dairy is the most prominent exclusion; it is entirely ring-fenced. The shield extends further: animal products (other than sheep meat), key vegetables, sugar, some oils and strategic nonagricultural sectors such as gems and jewelry, copper and aluminum are all excluded from tariff concessions.\n\nThis is an unmistakable signal that India will write modern, liberal trade rules, but it will do so while securing farmer incomes, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) resilience, and food security. This is not protectionism; it is democratic prioritization for a country where agriculture is a livelihood for millions and not just another sector to be casually bartered away.\n\nThe agreement’s spine, however, is not goods but rather services and mobility. New Zealand’s services commitments are its most ambitious to date, granting Indian firms broad access across IT and IT-enabled services, professional and business services, education, finance, tourism and construction.\n\nCrucially, the agreement includes a Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) clause: if New Zealand offers better terms to another partner in the future, India automatically receives the same benefits. For India’s already globally competitive services sector, this means new opportunities to establish a presence in Oceania, recruit local talent and scale operations in a stable, rules-based environment.\n\nBut the real innovation is the Temporary Employment Entry Visa, a pathway for up to 5,000 Indian professionals at any given time to live and work in New Zealand for up to three years, targeted at skill shortages (IT, engineering, healthcare, education, construction) and specialty roles (yoga instructors, Indian chefs, music teachers). Paired with the fact that the agreement removes numerical caps on Indian students, guarantees 20 hours/week of work during study, and extends post-study work to 3 years for science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates and 4 years for doctorates, as well as a 1,000-place Working Holiday scheme, and you’ve stitched the “living bridge” of a 300,000-strong Indian diaspora into the economic fabric.\n\nCritics — some inside New Zealand’s politics — have argued that these mobility channels “give too much away.” That is an entirely incorrect framing, though. Global trade today is not a container-ship contest; it is a talent distribution contest. When shortages hobble hospitals, classrooms and infrastructure sites, partnering with a country that supplies trained professionals under transparent, targeted and time-bound rules is not a concession for New Zealand; it is capacity building.\n\nFor India, talent mobility is not brain drain but instead brain circulation. Earnings, networks and know-how will eventually come home, while remittances in the interim can help stabilize families. Far from “giving away” jobs, this agreement allows New Zealand to fill gaps that its own workforce cannot meet. At the same time, the pathways it opens enable Indian professionals to gain global experience and return with skills that strengthen India’s economy — further enhancing India’s international reputation as a source of reliable, high-quality talent.\n\nThe FTA also does the dull yet decisive things right. Customs modernization commits India to 48-hour release windows at the border. That single clause can save exporters more money than many tariff cuts, because time itself can act as a shadow tariff. The pact hardwires cooperation on standards and sanitary rules and creates Agri-Technology Action Plans for kiwifruit, apples and honey. These plans mean both countries will collaborate on sharing best practices — needless to say, India will be the beneficiary.\n\nAdditionally, the agreement requires New Zealand to update its Geographical Indications (GI) framework, thereby granting India the same rights as the EU to register wines, spirits and other goods, ensuring full parity in GI protection. Regulatory access for pharmaceuticals, medical devices and organic products has also been streamlined, reducing duplication and accelerating approvals.\n\nThere is also long-term capital behind this agreement: New Zealand has pledged $ 20 billion in investment in India over the next 15 years. The scale of this commitment signals confidence in India’s economic trajectory and its potential as a global growth engine. The agreement also includes a rebalancing clause that allows India to take remedial measures if the delivery of investments falls short of its commitments. India has learned that FTAs without real capital and capability often disappoint; this one addresses both, the kind of long-term backbone that many earlier agreements lacked.\n\nOf course, no agreement is without its challenges. The FTA will require careful implementation and timely ratification, efficient visa processing, and real delivery on its various Agri-tech and customs commitments.\n\nBut from an Indian perspective, the fundamentals are solid: the deal is structured to maximize opportunity while safeguarding core interests. It is precisely the template India should look to replicate — combining asymmetric access to goods that favors MSMEs with ambitious services and talent mobility. It is bilateralism that looks beyond tariffs, focusing instead on people, productivity and a true sense of partnership.\n\nIndia’s new trade architecture is not merely about opening doors but about building bridges among economies, nations and, above all, people. In that vein, the India-New Zealand FTA is a blueprint for how the next decade of Indian trade can and should be built.\n\n[Kaitlyn Diana edited this piece.]\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.\n\nWe rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Fair Observer has been free, fair and independent.

    "fullText": "Even the pope is worried about how we're talking to chatbots.\n\nIn a written address for Saturday's World Day of Social Communications, Pope Leo XIV warned against personalized chatbots that can replicate friendly or intimate behavior.\n\n\"Overly affectionate chatbots, besides being ever-present and readily available, can become hidden architects of our emotional states, thereby invading and occupying the sphere of people's intimacy,\" the first-ever US-born pope wrote.\n\nThe pope called for national and international regulations to protect users from forming emotional, deceptive, or manipulative bonds with chatbots.\n\n\"All stakeholders — from the technology industry to policymakers, from creative businesses to academia, from artists to journalists and educators — must be involved in building and implementing a conscious and responsible digital citizenship,\" the pope wrote.\n\nThe Holy See leader has spoken about AI and his concerns with the technology several times since he was elected in May.\n\nIn his first address since becoming pope, he said he wanted to make AI a focus of his papacy and that the technology poses new challenges for \"human dignity, justice, and labor.\" In November, he wrote to AI leaders on X, calling on them to \"cultivate moral discernment\" when building AI tools.\n\nAt the end of last year, the pope met Megan Garcia, a woman whose 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer, died by suicide after interacting with a Character.AI chatbot.\n\nFlorida-based Garcia filed a lawsuit against chatbot-building startup Character.AI, alleging that the company, which lets people have in-depth and personal conversations with AI chatbots, was responsible for the death of her son, Sewell Setzer III.\n\nEarlier this month, Google and the startup agreed to settle multiple lawsuits from families, including Garcia, whose teenagers died by suicide or hurt themselves after interacting with Character.AI's bots. These negotiations are among the first settlements in lawsuits that accuse AI tools of contributing to mental health crises and suicides among teenagers.",

    "description": "Government bond markets in high-debt countries are under pressure as investors fear heavy borrowing will erode the value of money.",
    "fullText": "Gold has smashed past $5,000 per ounce — mere months after topping $4,000 — in a record-setting rally that analysts say reflects growing fears over high government debt.\n\n\"The rise in precious metals prices is breathtaking and profoundly scary,\" wrote Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, in a Substack post on Sunday.\n\nSpot gold rushed above a record high around $5,093 per troy ounce late on Sunday before pulling back to $5,070 per ounce at 12:03 a.m. ET on Monday.\n\nThe yellow metal's record-setting blitz has little to do with central bank gold buying. International Monetary Fund data show that emerging-market central bank purchases of gold have been steady rather than explosive, with no acceleration following the wave of sanctions imposed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, wrote Brooks.\n\nInstead, gold's rally coincides with growing pressure on government bond markets in high-debt countries. Investors are piling into hard assets in the so-called \"debasement trade,\" driven by fears that heavy government borrowing will steadily erode the value of money.\n\n\"We're at the start of a global debt crisis, with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away out-of-control debt,\" wrote Brooks, who is also a former chief FX strategist at Goldman Sachs.\n\nHe pointed to strains in heavily indebted countries such as Japan, alongside a flight to safety into low-debt countries such as Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nOne striking feature of the move is that it's breaking long-standing market relationships. Historically, gold prices tend to fall when real interest rates rise, since gold is a non-yielding asset and holding it carries an opportunity cost in a high-rate environment.\n\nThat link has now broken down \"in spectacular fashion,\" Brooks said, as fears about fiscal sustainability overwhelm traditional valuation signals.\n\nA weakening greenback could further fuel the move, as it makes it cheaper for non-dollar buyers to pile into dollar-denominated gold, he added.\n\nThe US Dollar Index is down 1.3% so far this year after holding broadly steady in the second half of 2025.\n\nBroader geopolitical concerns during President Donald Trump's second term are also boosting both the precious and base metals complex, according to veteran market strategist Ed Yardeni.\n\nDefense companies are ramping up production, boosting demand for metals, while an intensifying AI arms race is fueling capital spending across technology and infrastructure.\n\nHe pointed to the US fiscal outlook after President Donald Trump proposed boosting military spending to $1.5 trillion by 2027, up sharply from current levels.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has warned that the plan could add nearly $6 trillion to the national debt over the next decade — a concern that has coincided with rising Treasury yields.\n\n\"We are on alert for an attack on the US by the Bond Vigilantes,\" Yardeni wrote on Sunday, referring to investors demanding higher yields as government spending and debt climb.\n\nDespite gold's dramatic run, Yardeni says the rally isn't over. He is targeting gold at $6,000 by the end of this year — and $10,000 by the end of 2029.",

    "description": "The Unmanned Systems Forces' commander said his units' average engagement distance against Russian soldiers is less than 1 mile from the contact line.",
    "fullText": "The leader of Ukraine's special drone branch said his operators are striking advancing Russian infantry at extreme close range, providing rare insight into how some of the country's best pilots are fighting.\n\nMaj. Robert \"Madyar\" Brovdi, the commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, wrote in a statement on Sunday that his pilots have, over the last month, been engaging enemy troops at an average strike depth of 1.44 km, or 0.89 miles, from the line of contact.\n\nThat's a roughly 15-minute brisk walk for the average person.\n\n\"This figure fluctuates, but: We are literally working under our feet,\" Madyar wrote.\n\nHis remarks reflect how top Ukrainian commanders in some areas have been prioritizing their limited resources. Using elite strike crews for short-range suppression could also be a sign of heightened pressure on Ukrainian lines.\n\nThe Unmanned Systems Forces is a relatively new elite formation in Ukraine that focuses on providing strike or reconnaissance support with smaller drones. Madyar, a prominent drone unit commander appointed to lead the group in June 2025, said on Sunday that his branch comprises 12 combat crews who are present on 30% of the front line.\n\nRussia relies on ground infantry assaults to gradually take territory in Ukraine, and has been aggressively attempting to advance along some key frontline areas in recent months.\n\nMadyar wrote that his units are assigned to corps commanders, who have been deploying the operators to attack such advancing troops at closer range.\n\n\"Not a single Corps commander, who has many hundreds of crews from their own brigades and subordinate units within their area of responsibility, is ready to release SBS work to proper depth,\" Madyar wrote, referring to the Unmanned Systems Forces as the SBS.\n\nHe added that this was due to Ukrainian commanders wanting to protect their troops in the trenches.\n\nFor Ukrainian soldiers, being sent to hold a trench is one of the war's most high-casualty tasks. They're often outnumbered by waves of attacking Russian troops, and typically need the help of friendly drone pilots to thwart assaults before they can get close.\n\nBut ideally, these drone operators try to spot and engage enemy infantry farther away, roughly 6 to 10 miles from the line of contact, as these troops form up or begin to launch assaults.\n\n\"To systematically reach proper depth, it is necessary to manage to create new crews, at least three times more than the current number,\" Madyar wrote. \"The existing ones, for the most part, will remain in tactical depth.\"\n\nMadyar also said infantry strikes have recently accounted for a larger share of his units' time.\n\nAccording to him, the SBS has a usual goal of targeting infantry in 30% of its strikes, but nearly 40% of its successful attacks in December were against infantry, involving roughly 12,000 Russian soldiers.\n\nStill, the commander wrote that in the SBS' entire history, the majority of its engagements have been against Russian equipment and logistics routes, at ranges of roughly 2.3 miles to 9.2 miles, depending on the type of system targeted.\n\nMadyar's branch has struck over 1,200 \"launch points\" for Russian drone pilots, at an average depth of 2.25 miles, he added.\n\nElite drone units typically make a name for themselves by using small, inexpensive drones to strike priority air defense systems, logistics routes, or command posts deep behind enemy lines.\n\nIndeed, Madyar had posted his statement on Sunday in response to what he said were recent criticisms that his units were focusing too much on strikes against Russian soldiers.\n\nMadyar also wrote that not all SBS crews are equally contributing to these strike statistics.\n\n\"Only six to seven out of 12 SBS units are working at the desired pace; the others are catching up and need more time,\" his statement said.",

    "description": "For Jack Buser, who has worked in the gaming industry for 30 years, AI is  an opportunity to push the boundaries of player experiences.",
    "fullText": "Tony Stark relied on his ultra-polished, tech-heavy \"Iron Man\" suit to achieve his superhero feats.\n\nJack Buser, the global director for games at Google Cloud, thinks AI will help game developers in the same way.\n\n\"There will always be holdouts, just like every technological revolution, but it's becoming so common now,\" Buser told Business Insider. \"We're seeing a major shift.\"\n\nBuser and other tech industry leaders have said that implementing AI could transform how people work. In the gaming industry, the tech could help streamline operations, resulting in cost cuts, faster production times, or help developers tackle an array of tasks.\n\n\"It's like the Iron Man suit of armor, right? It's still you inside the suit of armor, but you're suddenly able to do things that you couldn't do before,\" Buser said. \"If you armor everybody up in your studio with suits that allow them to work more quickly and remove the drudgery, that tends to be well received after it's been implemented.\"\n\nBuser urged executives at studios and companies to take the lead by giving developers the necessary tools.\n\n\"If you're the CTO of a games company, make that suit of armor available. Make sure that it's safe. Make sure that you take the time to work with people inside your company so that they can understand what the technology can and can't do, and what your intentions for the technology are and what they are not,\" Buser said.\n\n\"It has as much to do with getting these tools up and running in your development pipelines as it does working culturally with your company to help it make that transformation,\" he added.\n\nGetting comfortable with AI, he said, shouldn't be confined to developers alone.\n\n\"It can be tricky at the executive level. You don't have a crystal ball of where this is all going,\" he said. \"It takes getting your hands dirty, experimenting with the technology, seeing what it does and what it doesn't do.\"\n\nMany global industries are undergoing a technological shift driven by advances in AI. Companies are increasingly adopting the tech in their workflows, which some critics say could diminish job prospects for humans. Supporters argue it's a powerful tool that can help workers do their jobs better and faster.\n\nFor Buser, who has worked in the gaming industry for 30 years, AI has created an opportunity to push the boundaries of player experiences. At Google, that means embracing the era of \"living games.\"\n\nThe live games model, in which developers continue to add new content to a game after its initial release, is already common. AI, however, could make living games more adaptable, personalized, and immersive. The AI could also shorten update turnaround time, making the transition for players more seamless.\n\n\"As we look forward, we're looking at things like real-time game experiences,\" Buser said.\n\nFor now, though, the gaming industry will be focused on scaling and normalizing the tech.\n\n\"2026 is where companies start to scale these efforts,\" Buser said. \"Game developers who were using AI in one or two parts of their development workflow will suddenly be using it throughout their workflow. You'll start to see games that are using multiple AI-based features that are affecting the player experience.\"",

    "title": "A Skadden veteran's uneasy take on smarter machines",
    "description": "A \"brick wall\" moment changed his career. He wants younger generations to get that chance, too.",
    "fullText": "Three years out of law school, in 1990, David Goldschmidt landed the kind of assignment most young corporate lawyers only dream of: taking a company public.\n\nWhen a senior partner at the venerated New York law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom told him to \"run with\" biotech company Regeneron's IPO, his career changed.\n\nGoldschmidt sweated his way through writing the prospectus, translating the company's scientific ambitions into plain language for investors. Regeneron raised twice the expected amount in the initial offering.\n\nThe victory was volatile. The stock swung sharply after the IPO, prompting shareholder lawsuits. A federal judge dismissed the cases against Regeneron, finding the company's disclosures to be accurate and legally sufficient. And for Goldschmidt, the trial by fire taught him something.\n\n\"I could do this,\" he remembers thinking.\n\nGoldschmidt rose through the ranks to become a partner and, eventually, the global head of Skadden's capital markets practice, advising companies on raising capital in the public or private markets. His name appeared routinely on the opening pages of S-1 filings, including those of Casper, Match Group, and Rivian Automotive, whose $12 billion raise was one of the largest US IPOs in history. In 2025 alone, the hundred-person Skadden group handled more than $300 billion worth of transactions.\n\nGoldschmidt retired last month after 37 years at Skadden, ending a tenure that made him a rare constant in an industry increasingly defined by churn.\n\nWhile he stayed put, the ground beneath him did not. From his perch at Skadden, the fourth-highest-grossing law firm in the country, Goldschmidt worked through a technological revolution that shifted the legal industry from analog to algorithmic.\n\nHe's not convinced smarter machines make for better lawyers.\n\nI met Goldschmidt two weeks before he retired, in a conference room high above Manhattan's West Side. The 62-year-old looked relaxed in a tailored navy suit. He asked for a coffee, and within minutes, a pair of staffers set up a full barista station on the credenza. We each poured, and I asked him when he decided he wanted to be a lawyer.\n\n\"Five years into practicing,\" he said.\n\nGoldschmidt went to law school unsure about what kind of law he wanted to practice, driven only by a curiosity about \"how the markets work,\" he said. At first, he purposely avoided Big Law, starting at the smaller, white-shoe firm Breed, Abbott & Morgan. On his first day at the New York office, a woman in HR led him on a meet-and-greet with the partners. With each knock on a partner's door, the mood darkened.\n\nAt one office, the woman began her script. \"How are you doing today? This is Mr. Goldschmidt. He's starting today —\"\n\n\"How do you think I'm doing?\" the partner cut in. \"The market's down 22%.\"\n\nIt was October 19, 1987, Black Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 500 points, wiping out roughly half a trillion dollars in market value.\n\nThe crash was violent but brief, and soon leveraged buyouts and mergers exploded. For law firms working those deals, the frenzy translated into enormous amounts of work. Goldschmidt realized that the \"genteel\" lifestyle he had sought was an illusion.\n\n\"Regardless of what size law firm you work at, you're going to work hard,\" he said. Within his first year, he left to join Skadden's capital markets practice, securing a front-row seat to the global economy that he would occupy for the next 37 years. He fell in love with the fervor of the environment and the people hustling beside him.\n\nThe intensity of the work hasn't changed. The work itself has.\n\nWhen he started, his desk held a LexisNexis terminal, an angular box with a built-in keyboard used for case law research; he used it as a surface for Post-it notes. He wrote documents longhand on a legal pad, handing them off to a typing pool staffed by, as Goldschmidt recalls, \"aspiring actors.\"\n\nEditing a document meant two associates sitting side by side with the new and old versions, reading the first word of every line aloud to mark where the draft had changed. He dashed to meet the mail courier at 9 p.m. to make sure clients had the documents in the morning.\n\nGoldschmidt saw this as valuable repetition, learning through what he calls \"sweat equity.\" He didn't study judgment; he accumulated it. Even as Microsoft Word replaced typing pools and due diligence moved online, much of the mental work of synthesizing information remained.\n\nThose reps became part of Goldschmidt's value to clients, said Jeffrey Horowitz, a longtime Bank of America executive who worked with him across multiple transactions. \"You're getting long-term advice — grounded in history and a real relationship,\" he said.\n\nRegeneron remains a Skadden client, now a roughly $77 billion biotech. Its cofounder and CEO, Dr. Leonard Schleifer, remembers Goldschmidt as a \"workhorse,\" citing his attention to detail and command of the law.\n\nNow, with the legal industry on the cusp of another shift, artificial intelligence is beginning to absorb some of the routine work that once consumed junior lawyers' time. Goldman Sachs has said the technology could someday automate 44% of legal work.\n\nGoldschmidt's own introduction to the technology came from his son, then a Big Law associate. He gave him a demo of a legal software called Harvey, which could draft and find answers in documents that might take an associate hours of slogging. \"It just blew me away,\" Goldschmidt said.\n\nThat efficiency raised a fundamental question. How do you train young lawyers when machines do the work for them?\n\nFor Goldschmidt, the value of sweat equity isn't just hard work. It's the intellectual struggle of problem-solving. Learning, he said, happens when you \"hit a brick wall and veer off\" to find another path. If new tools surface answers instantly, he worries, junior lawyers may lose not only the habit of wrestling a question to its conclusion, but the legal fundamentals needed to recognize when a chatbot is hallucinating or getting it wrong.\n\nStill, Goldschmidt is careful not to romanticize the past. \"It may be easier,\" he said. But law, he argues, has never been a profession where fulfillment comes from sitting at a desk and simply executing tasks.\n\n\"A fulfilling career,\" he said, \"is going out there, stretching, meeting people, learning — seeing what's around the bend.\"\n\nInside Skadden, Goldschmidt said, there's a saying: Walk through walls for the client.\n\nThat ethos only intensified as new tools arrived. Legal work, after all, is a service business. Email and cellphones reset expectations for speed and responsiveness. Now, clients are pushing law firms to adopt artificial intelligence in the name of more efficient service. Skadden pays for its lawyers to have access to Harvey and other tools used for research, drafting, and document review.\n\nFor Goldschmidt, even the early technology was a \"double-edged sword.\" A BlackBerry meant he could finally go to a movie on a Saturday night without worrying he might miss a call. But it also meant there was no longer any real off-switch. The culture didn't always allow lawyers to check out.\n\nGoldschmidt remembers around that time reading an article about email that described how Bill Gates would sit down at his computer at night and respond to his messages in one sitting. \"How lucky is that guy,\" Goldschmidt remembers thinking, \"that he can wait till the end of the day?\"\n\nAs Goldschmidt prepared to retire on New Year's Eve, he remained optimistic about the next generation of lawyers, provided they remember that the job requires more than just prompting chatbots. Looking back on the shift from legal pads to large language models, he offers a final assessment of his four decades in the arena — not as a protagonist, but as an essential witness.\n\n\"I may not have invented anything,\" Goldschmidt said. \"I may not have started a company that changed anything. But I had a front-row seat to all those people, those companies, who did.\"\n\nMelia Russell is a senior correspondent with Business Insider, covering the intersection of law and technology.",

    "description": "Business Insider spoke to readers in their 20s to 80s about what capitalism means to them and why some of them are rethinking the system.",
    "fullText": "Business Insider recently launched our Future of Capitalism series to examine shifting attitudes about capitalism, fairness, opportunity, hard work, and success in the US — everything from the federal government's role in the economy to the change in how capitalism is being taught in high schools.\n\nWe also wanted to hear directly from you, our readers, about how America's economic system has shaped your life.\n\nHundreds of you weighed in, and several people agreed to be interviewed to share more deeply their experiences, uncertainty, frustration, and cautious optimism — a revealing snapshot of how capitalism is being reassessed in real time, across generations.\n\nAn 81-year-old woman in California living on Social Security described spending her life climbing a hill that keeps getting steeper. A 54-year-old in Las Vegas says he's still waiting for boomers to pass his generation the baton. A 25-year-old from Tennessee who enlisted in the military to pay for college said the system isn't really working, while a 64-year-old New Jersey retiree called capitalism the \"greatest economic system in the world.\"\n\nBelow, we highlight eight people's personal experiences of capitalism. Their words have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAlex English, 38, is based in Tampa, FL, and is currently unemployed after being laid off.\n\nI've been unemployed for a year and a half. Before being laid off, I lived in LA and worked in marketing and communications at a startup. I was making almost $125,000 and still felt poor.\n\nCapitalism makes us think we constantly need more: to shop more, to accumulate more, to keep up. I'm back in Tampa, where I grew up, because I didn't have the savings to sustain my life in LA.\n\nI don't feel great about my ability to improve my situation through hard work alone. I've relentlessly networked to find a full-time job, taken on freelance work, and gotten a retail job. I'm working harder than I ever have and yet making significantly less money than before.\n\nWe're inheriting a system that feels ultimately outdated. Everything from private property and ownership to the climate crisis feels unsustainable. We're paying into Social Security, and that may not be there for us when we're retirement age.\n\nSince my layoff, I've been reading a lot about economics and business. Is there another way that we could be doing things? My generation — millennials — is in favor of something kinder and more egalitarian than the policies we've seen since the Reagan era. Not because we're lazy or unwilling to work hard, but because we believe all people deserve basic rights and dignity, and that American exceptionalism is dead in the world.\n\nHarish Bhandari, 64, Cape May, New Jersey. He retired from his job in the advertising industry at 59.\n\nI'm happily retired. I spent my entire career in advertising and marketing — worked on Madison Avenue, then spent 23 or 24 years at an agency in Minneapolis, and 15 years at my last company.\n\nCapitalism is the greatest economic system in the world. As long as you're willing to work hard over a long period of time, you're going to be rewarded, and success should follow.\n\nI didn't grow up wealthy. I lived in Darien, Connecticut. My father was from India, and my mom was German. She grew up during the war and didn't go to college. My father passed away when I was 13. I'm not going to say we were poor, but we weren't wealthy. I'm thankful I've worked hard my whole life and made some good moves.\n\nThe obvious legacy my generation is leaving is that we're able to pass generational wealth to our kids. I'm an early baby boomer. Boomers get a hard time as far as having been lucky, but I think we've also worked very hard. Sometimes you create your own luck that way. We didn't have social media and cellphones, so we didn't have a lot of things bombarding us that would distract us from what we believed was important.\n\nI currently have a very high level of trust in our economic institutions because it's about the free market. As long as the institutions provide security and stability, the market has always worked as far as this country has been around. When you try to start messing with that market, that's the problem.\n\nMatthew Doutt, 25, Knoxville, Tennessee. He's an accountant.\n\nIn my senior year of high school, a military recruiter sat down with me and explained the average in-state college tuition. I didn't see any options to earn my degree that didn't involve the military or going into debt.\n\nI knew college was expensive, and my parents were kind of pushing me toward the military for that reason. Once I enlisted, I realized many other people there were in the same boat, or very similar boats, as I was. I'm grateful for the benefits from the military, but my mental health was at an all-time low during my time in the Guard. It's a travesty that any American would need to sign a contract that could result in their death to pay for a degree without going into debt.\n\nEven after I finished my bachelor's degree in 2022, the firm I started working at wasn't a good fit, so I left. I couldn't find work for four months. I was completely reliant on the Guard again, this time to pay my bills. That was another moment when I realized this system really isn't working as intended.\n\nI now hold both my bachelor's and master's degrees, as well as a CPA license. I worked hard for them, but I wouldn't have been able to earn my bachelor's degree without the Guard, and I wouldn't have been able to get my CPA license without my firm paying for it.\n\nI believe my generation has inherited difficult circumstances. Corporations are more concentrated, and the US DOJ has been less empowered than ever to break up monopolies.\n\nI want to trust these major institutions and systems because they don't improve if you don't believe in them. At the same time, if what they're doing isn't good to begin with, it's kind of hard to trust them.\n\nJeremy Holmes, 40, lives in Denver. He is a senior developer in the furniture import industry.\n\nMy dad is what I'd call a bad capitalist, because he takes care of his employees. He owns an IT firm, and I worked for him until I was in my early 30s. He was a firm believer that hard work will get you far in life. And it did; he was a kid of immigrants, and he clawed his way out. My mom is Lakota, grew up on various reservations, and got out.\n\nMy parents have a very nice upper-middle-class life. They're not yacht-money people. My dad went from working as a 12 or 14-year-old in a print shop and has always had that \"work hard and you will be rewarded\" mentality. I was raised with that. Then I entered the workforce and started looking around. The hard workers aren't the ones who are getting paid the most.\n\nI feel the people working in the factory are working much harder than the people on the other side of the office. I'm fortunate enough to be on that other side because I got a leg up from my parents. I don't see a way for people to claw their way into a comfortable living if they weren't born into it.\n\nMy main concern is being a programmer in the AI era. I've been doing this for most of my life. I can stay above it, but I'm more worried than I was before. I don't see how anyone can bring a child into this world and not be terrified for them. I have plenty of friends who are not doing as well, and I used to tell them to get into IT; I can't even tell them that anymore.\n\nJenni Abbott,71, lives in Antioch, IL. She works as a principal scientist.\n\nI don't believe that hard work alone plays any significant role in an outcome. Not working hard can cost you your job. Working hard does not guarantee any sort of success.\n\nI left the industry for about 20 years to be a stay-at-home mom of four kids. When I was 42, my husband died suddenly. I went into education. I was first a kindergarten aide for three years, and then a high school registrar for six. I was lucky enough to get a job as an associate toxicologist. We were literally running out of money at that point.\n\nI've now been with the same company for over 20 years. While I'm not completely satisfied with how I was rewarded in my career, I also understand that I am doing better than a great number of people out there, and I'm relatively financially secure. One of the reasons I'm still working is that I don't want to be that poor.\n\nI'm all for a mixed system. I believe capitalism is a good start, but I don't believe it's a good ending place. I believe that additional resources need to be there for it to be successful, and there needs to be support in place so everybody has the same chances at upward mobility.\n\nI don't think we baby boomers lived up to our potential for what we should've left behind for the next generation. Social safety nets are important for a lot of people, and we could have done a much better job of preparing our country for that.\n\nKathy Curtis, 81, lives in California. She works part-time in customer service and data entry for a local water company.\n\nI started out like everybody else with the expectation that you grow up, get married, have children, and live happily ever after, which is what we were taught. That didn't happen for me because within a year of following the plan, all of a sudden, I was a single parent. At one point, I was working four jobs.\n\nI didn't have the strength to branch out into other fields of study or work to try to get ahead because I was so busy trying to just maintain everything. From my 20s to my 40s, I felt I could keep climbing up the hill. I think after my 40s, in general, that hill got steeper, and not as many people were able to climb it.\n\nI'll struggle for the rest of my life. My main income at this point is Social Security, and I still work two days a week, earning $18 an hour in a customer service and data entry role for a local water company. I've learned how to not look like a poor person when I am one, and not live like one. So much of life is attitude.\n\nKirk Reynolds, 54, lives in Las Vegas. He is an architect.\n\nI entered the workforce in 1997 and have spent the last 28 years working as an architect. I worry a lot about the future liquidity of Social Security because if we don't have Social Security in 10 years' time, I don't know what I'll do.\n\nI'm fortunate to now own my home outright, but it took a lot of sacrifice over the years to get there. I didn't travel or spend a lot of extra money; it was a deliberate and challenging choice. However, wages have somewhat stalled out. I earn more now than I did when I started in the workforce, but after 28 years, I don't earn much more. I was around 28 when I started my 401(k), and I have less than $100,000 in it 20-some years later. I'll be lucky if there's $115,000 in there when I retire.\n\nI think part of the problem is the boomer generation; they're among the oldest people in our society now, and a lot of them just haven't left the CEO roles, the managerial roles. I'm not sure if that's purely because they can't afford to retire, or if there's also an element of ego involved, but I'm 54, and I'm still waiting for them to finally pass the baton to the next generation.\n\nI'm worried that my generation will be skipped because all of a sudden, when the leaders in their 70s and 80s finally retire, they'll give the roles to the 40-year-olds.\n\nIt's sad because I think Gen X would do a very good job of leading. We are the bridge generation, born at a time when we can recall how things were in the 1970s, and how things are now.\n\nGabrielle Benson, 29, lives in Chicago. She works in inclusion and experience at a tech company.\n\nI'm on the cusp of millennial and Gen Z. There was so much transition, development, and growth that we came up through. Some people in my generation think capitalism is great and were able to benefit from that change, but a lot of us recognize its more negative impact.\n\nWe're coming from a background in the post-recession, post-Obama, post-social media era. We don't see the American dream as a gilded promise the way previous generations did.\n\nI grew up Black and middle-class in Washington, DC. But I went to a private boarding school for high school, so I've had proximity to a lot of wealth. The experience of being at this school and then going home to my mom, who worked two jobs, compared to the other parents, who worked just as hard, but had institutional knowledge or advantages that we didn't, started opening my eyes. Hard work is not valued equally under this system.\n\nInequity is not a side effect of capitalism; it is a condition required for it to function. Instead of family stories about hard work granting stability or prosperity, we have stories about hard work being stolen or dismissed by the systems meant to reward it.\n\nThere are so many factors outside an average person's control that can determine their success: the job market, housing market, healthcare, race, sex, and gender. I have a corporate job, a degree, and retirement accounts, and it still feels like it can all be taken away by factors outside my control.\n\nI think we have a lot of opportunities as millennials. We're still young; we can still make a lot of change, but I think it will require a lot of unlearning the knowledge we were passed down, like the idea that you just have to work hard.\n\nI don't think that we're going to have a different system in our lifetime. Maybe that's something our grandkids might be able to experience. We're going to have to navigate and manage capitalism.\n\nShare your thoughts about capitalism in America by filling out our survey.",

    "description": "After being laid off, Amy Lovett revised her résumé to remove her photo and downplay her work experience. That's when she started getting more calls.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Lovett, 54. After being laid off in July, Lovett began her job search with a résumé that included her photo and full work experience. Once she removed her photo, some dates, and shortened her work history, Lovett, who lives in the St. Louis area, said she started getting more attention from employers. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nAt my last job as an account executive at a software company, we had downsized significantly. I was one of the last senior reps. From what I understand, it was a payroll decision. In July, I was laid off after 20 years.\n\nAt first, of course, you're a little panicked, but I wouldn't say I was too crazy. It was also a bit of relief, because there had been so much business change going on that everybody was kind of on edge.\n\nI was in a position to take a step back and really figure out what I wanted to do. I didn't want to take too much time off, but I was able to take enough to be like, \"OK, what do I like about this? What don't I?\"\n\nI took probably a couple of weeks. After that, it was full focus on my résumé and talking with former colleagues. September is when I really started hitting the job search hard.\n\nWith my résumé, I changed keywords as needed. You've got to make them more specific to the role these days. Otherwise you you won't even get a call. You've definitely got to do more customization than you used to.\n\nI got some responses, but I didn't get any interviews. Originally, I had my photo on my résumé. That résumé also included a lot of dates. I would say I'm a younger-looking 50. I wouldn't say I look like I'm 80 or anything.\n\nI had a career advisor review my résumé. She said, \"Try taking your photo off of there. Remove a lot of the dates.\" So I took my past experience, except for the last 20 years, off. For older jobs, I would give a bullet, but it was mainly the last 20 years-plus of my experience.\n\nOnce I made those changes, that's when I started getting pinged fairly often. It absolutely felt like night and day. I was having calls with companies two to three times a week.\n\nI felt there was a bigger demand out there than I initially thought, which gave me more confidence — feeling like, \"OK, these companies are pinging me and showing interest.\"\n\nI think ageism was a factor, especially with a lot of SaaS companies that have a lot of younger people right out of college.\n\nDuring my search, I didn't let up. I took it seriously. I was working on résumés and applications every weekday. It's hard to stay positive for that long, doing that day after day. For some reason, I was energized to try something new.\n\nI had a spreadsheet. I had to keep track of everything because there was a lot of information. I didn't want to be out of work for long.\n\nI would tweak my résumé. I would run it through AI. I don't like the AI-generated résumés. You can tell they're AI. The verbiage, a lot of times, doesn't sound like a person. I would never write like that. You've got to think: Does it sound like how you would communicate?\n\nI did lean into AI because it helped me speed up the process, because there's so much involved, and I was really just trying to find something as quickly as possible.\n\nI used AI when I would work on my cover letters. I would take my résumé and compare it to their job requirements, and then shorten it. I think those personalizations were super important.\n\nGoing forward, especially in the field that I'm in, you've got to embrace technology.\n\nWhen I got the job offer, they called me. I missed the call because I wasn't by my phone. I was supposed to have another interview in two days, so I was like, \"This is either good or bad.\"\n\nI called back, and they said, \"Oh, we don't need you for that last interview. We'd like to offer you the job.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career? Contact this reporter at tparadis@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Nick Copeland explains how renting unused parking spaces and managing midterm rentals brings in a consistent five-figure monthly income.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nick Copland, a 42-year-old real estate investor and the cofounder of MTR Authority, who lives outside Portland, Oregon. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always been an entrepreneur at heart. As a kid, I found creative ways to make money — mowing lawns, shoveling snow, stump grinding — anything that gave me the freedom to earn on my own terms.\n\nNow, I run MTR Authority, a program that helps other investors build and scale mid-term rental operations, create systems for financial freedom, and uncover overlooked income streams, with my wife, Shannan.\n\nOne part of our business involves renting unused parking spaces, and it has become an excellent source of passive income.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2018, I held a variety of corporate leadership roles, where I learned the fundamentals of operations, project management, and process design. In 2019, Shannan and I started experimenting with short-term rentals on the side.\n\nOver the next few years, that side project evolved into a real-estate business centered on mid-term rentals (MTRs) and rental arbitrage, the process of leasing a property in the name of your business, and within the rental agreement with the property owner, your business can then sublease the property.\n\nEventually, we were able to leave our W-2 jobs completely and focus on growing our real estate portfolio and coaching business. We've now surpassed our former combined W-2 income.\n\nI was working full-time, and Shannan was working part-time, as we had an infant and a toddler at home. We built and managed the glamping sites ourselves, from construction and décor to guest communication, learning hospitality the hard but rewarding way.\n\nWhen a job relocation brought us to Oregon during the pandemic, we began house hacking, renting out the lower level of our home to traveling professionals. That's how we discovered the mid-term rental (MTR) niche — longer stays for nurses, consultants, and families between moves. We reinvested every profit, eventually growing to 13 properties across owned and rental-arbitrage units.\n\nOnce we reached that milestone, we began exploring other ways to maximize each property's earning potential. That's when we found Neighbor, a storage and parking marketplace.\n\nWe joined the platform in August 2021 and, by renting our unused driveways, garages, and side lots, we've generated nearly $30,000 in profit with almost no ongoing effort. Neighbor does take a small fee from each rental.\n\nWe list spaces such as driveways, empty lots, and fenced yards on our properties that aren't in use. Once listed, renters book monthly, and we receive automatic payments — no showings, no maintenance, and minimal communication.\n\nRenters use this service for long-term storage of their cars, boats, RVs, or trailers. Renters like the arrangement because of the proximity of the parking spaces to them, better pricing, and being able to work with a person directly instead of a company. Sometimes people choose us also because a traditional storage place might not allow them to park their type of vehicle.\n\nOur complete portfolio brings in a consistent five-figure monthly income from midterm rentals, with Neighbor adding an extra layer of predictable, hands-off cash flow. Neighbor has become one of the most passive revenue streams we've found.\n\nMost of our workweek centers on strategy and system building, not daily management. We dedicate a few hours a day to MTR Authority coaching and business development, while our property management systems handle most of our rental operations. This mix allows us to work 25 to 30 hours a week, leaving the rest for family time and travel.\n\nWorking with Shannan has been one of the best parts of this journey. We balance each other's strengths and handle operations together; I handle sales and finance, and Shannan handles marketing.\n\nThe key to making it work is communication and clear boundaries. We schedule \"no work talk\" time and treat our business meetings like any other professional commitment.\n\nMy advice to other couples is to set shared goals and define clear roles early. When you respect each other's strengths, the partnership becomes a real advantage.\n\nReal estate and Neighbor gave us the ability to buy back our time and design a life around our family, not around a job. Our motto has become: Real wealth is quiet, it's the peace of knowing your time is your own.\n\nWe started small, stayed consistent, and treated every space — even empty spots — as a potential income stream. That mindset changed everything.",

    "description": "Synthesia just raised a $200 million Series E funding round and is now valued at $4 billion. CEO Victor Riparbelli shares his daily routine.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Victor Riparbelli, the CEO of AI video platform Synthesia. On Monday, the company announced a $200 million Series E funding round led by Google Ventures. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI founded Synthesia in 2017, and it's now a $4 billion unicorn.\n\nThe platform allows businesses to leverage generative AI to create videos for a range of corporate use cases, such as reimagining training videos, generating AI avatars of company executives to deliver internal or external messages, or dubbing webinars into dozens of languages.\n\nTo keep myself going all day, I rely on a few daily indulgences and productivity hacks.\n\nFirst and foremost, my bike. Unless the weather is terrible, I prefer to bike to and from the office most days. That's my most important ritual.\n\nAlso, coffee breaks. If I'm tired or in a bad mood, I'll go for a 15-minute walk and get an extra nice coffee at Blank Street.\n\nMy biggest non-negotiable indulgence is music. I love underground music and listen to it whenever I'm not in a meeting.\n\nI wish I were one of those 5 a.m. people, but I get up at 8 a.m., shower, and head straight to the office.\n\nI try not to check my phone before I leave my apartment, and I'm successful about 75% of the time.\n\nOnce I sit down at work, I usually go through my phone — messages, emails, and anything that came in overnight. I try to keep my early mornings free of meetings, so I have time to process things. That's when I feel the most creative, and it's when I prefer to do deep work. It's not always possible since we work across US time zones, but I generally try to protect that time. That deep-work window usually runs from around 9:30 a.m. until lunch at noon.\n\nDuring that time, I'm doing a mix of things: interviews, a lot of product work, and internal thinking. I'm still very involved in product and like to stay close to the details, even though that gets harder as the company grows. I focus on specific areas where I think my input is most valuable and try to go deep there.\n\nA big part of that time is also spent reading Slack. I make a real effort to read almost everything every day. I skim most of it, and I don't react to everything, but spending half an hour going through Slack is one of the best ways for me to understand what's actually happening across the company.\n\nAll internal communication happens on Slack — it's not a policy, it's just how the company operates. No one emails internally. For external communication, I probably split my time between email and WhatsApp, with a strong preference for WhatsApp and instant messaging. It really depends on the relationship.\n\nI usually have either a Joe & The Juice sandwich — specifically the club sandwich — or a salad. I actually used to work at Joe & The Juice early on, so I've been eating it for a long time and still love it.\n\nI don't really take time for lunch. I usually eat on the go or at my desk, and I'm typically done by around 12:30 p.m.\n\nI switch between New York and London, and when I'm based in London, the US starts to wake up in the second half of my day, so my calendar fills up with more international meetings.\n\nThe work itself stays fairly consistent: a lot of product, which I'm very involved in, as well as hiring, and external-facing work.\n\nMy cofounder, Steffen Tjerrild, now chief operating officer, and I split the business in half. I run product, technology, and marketing, while he oversees finance, operations, and sales. In those areas, I'm typically only involved at the VP level, depending on the situation. On my side of the business, I'm involved at the director level and above, though I'll sometimes go deeper when it makes sense.\n\nI have an assistant who helps manage my schedule, including some overlap with my personal life. I also try to talk to at least one user or customer every week because staying close to how people actually use the product is important to me. That, along with internal meetings, makes up most of the rest of my day. I still meet with people beyond my direct reports, often through skip-level conversations.\n\nFor example, I'll talk with our video team, who use our product for marketing, or with a sales development representative to understand what's working and what isn't. It's one of the best ways for me to stay connected to what's really happening across the company.\n\nI usually leave the office around 7 or 8 p.m. Three or four nights a week, I go to the gym, then head home and unwind. About half the time, I'll work another hour or two later in the evening.\n\nDinner is usually quick. I live alone and mostly order in, though I'll occasionally cook eggs with bacon and avocado. When I order food, it's often something simple like chicken and fries. I try to eat fairly healthy and avoid eating too late because it has a big impact on my energy, especially since I'm a bad sleeper.\n\nAt night, if I'm not working, I'm usually reading or making music. I don't watch much TV, but I love serious sci-fi films like \"Interstellar\" and \"Arrival\" and Stanley Kubrick movies like \"A Clockwork Orange.\"\n\nI used to read a lot of business books. \"Zero to One\" by Peter Thiel and Blake Masters, and \"The Black Swan\" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb were especially influential. These days, I read a mix of books and online content and spend a lot of time watching videos about technology, psychology, philosophy, and politics.\n\nI'm a terrible sleeper. The only hack that I found is that I fall asleep to podcasts or YouTube videos.\n\nI like to find ones that are interesting enough that they catch my attention — topics like physics or philosophy — but not important enough to me that I actually really want to listen to them.\n\nThen I put a sleep timer on for half an hour — and that usually knocks me out.",

    "description": "Regulators said the company’s lack of controls had led to the widespread use of deepfakes created with the chatbot Grok.",
    "fullText": "European Union regulators on Monday announced an investigation of Elon Musk’s social media platform X after the authorities said that it had failed to stop the spread of sexualized images generated by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe inquiry is likely to escalate a confrontation between Europe and the United States over the regulation of online content. Mr. Musk and his allies in the Trump administration have sharply criticized European Union internet regulations as an attack on free speech and American companies.\n\nThe European authorities said that X was being investigated for possible violation of the Digital Services Act, alleging that the company had not properly addressed the “systemic risks” of integrating the A.I. chatbot Grok into its service. Starting in late December, sexually explicit images generated by Grok, including of children, flooded the service, drawing worldwide criticism from victims and regulators.\n\nMr. Musk was facing mounting scrutiny in Europe even before this latest Grok controversy. Last month, X was fined 120 million euros, or about $140 million, for violating Digital Services Act rules around deceptive design, advertising transparency and data sharing with outside researchers.\n\nThe European authorities have another investigation underway about X’s recommender algorithm and policies for preventing the spread of illicit content.\n\n“Nonconsensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation,” Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission executive vice president who oversees enforcement of the Digital Service Act, said in a statement. “We will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the D.S.A., or whether it treated rights of European citizens — including those of women and children — as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nThe European Commission, the executive body for the 27-nation European Union, did not give a timeline for the investigation, but said that it had the authority to order X to make changes during the inquiry in the “absence of meaningful adjustments” to the service.\n\nA spokeswoman for X referred to a previous statement the company had made about Grok. “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity and unwanted sexual content,” the statement said.\n\nThe latest investigation illustrates a growing divide between the European Union and the United States over free speech and regulation of the internet. European officials argue that the lack of safeguards on platforms like X has allowed hate speech, misogyny and violent content to flourish online. Mr. Musk and the Trump administration have said efforts to force the companies to more proactively police the services amounts to censorship.\n\nThe Digital Services Act, passed in 2022, requires companies to meaningfully address the spread of illegal content, the definition of which varies from country to country in the European Union. It can include material that targets individuals based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or religion.\n\nEuropean regulators said that the integration of Grok into X exposed “citizens in the E.U. to serious harm.” The British authorities are also investigating the issue.\n\nThe problems began last month. In response to simple user prompts on X, the chatbot automatically created and publicly posted manipulated photographs of real people, including children, to remove their clothes, put them in skimpy clothing or pose them in sexualized situations.\n\nAs criticism grew, X limited Grok’s A.I. image creation to users who paid for premium features, which reduced the number of images. X later expanded those guardrails, saying that it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.”\n\nEuropean Union regulators said that they would take X’s policy changes into account during the investigation.",

    "title": "\"Bitcoin Jesus\" Avoided Prison, Thanks to One of the \"Friends of Trump\"",
    "description": "Billionaire fugitive Roger Ver was facing federal criminal charges until he sought the services of a select club of President Donald Trump’s former personal attorneys who have easy access to top Justice Department appointees.",
    "fullText": "These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nDays into President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House, a cryptocurrency billionaire posted a video on X to his hundreds of thousands of followers. “Please Donald Trump, I need your help,” he said, wearing a flag pin askew and seated awkwardly in an armchair. “I am an American. … Help me come home.”\n\nThe speaker, 46-year-old Roger Ver, was in fact no longer a U.S. citizen. Nicknamed “Bitcoin Jesus” for his early evangelism for digital currency, Ver had renounced his citizenship more than a decade earlier. At the time of his video, Ver was under criminal indictment for millions in tax evasion and living on the Spanish island of Mallorca. His top-flight legal defense team had failed around half a dozen times to persuade the Justice Department to back down. The U.S., considering him a fugitive, was seeking his extradition from Spain, and he was likely looking at prison.\n\nOnce, prosecutors hoped to make Ver a marquee example amid concerns about widespread cryptocurrency tax evasion. They had spent eight painstaking years working the case. Just nine months after his direct-to-camera appeal, however, Ver and Trump’s new Justice Department leadership cut a remarkable deal to end his prosecution. Ver wouldn’t have to plead guilty or spend a day in prison. Instead, the government accepted a payout of $49.9 million — roughly the size of the tax bill prosecutors said he dodged in the first place — and allowed him to walk away.\n\nVer was able to pull off this coup by taking advantage of a new dynamic inside of Trump’s Department of Justice. A cottage industry of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants with close ties to Trump has sprung up to help people and companies seek leniency, often by arguing they had been victims of political persecution by the Biden administration. In his first year, Trump issued pardons or clemency to dozens of people who were convicted of various forms of white-collar crime, including major donors and political allies. Investigations have been halted. Cases have been dropped.\n\nWithin the Justice Department, a select club of Trump’s former personal attorneys have easy access to the top appointees, some of whom also previously represented Trump. It has become a dark joke among career prosecutors to refer to these lawyers as the “Friends of Trump.”\n\nThe Ver episode, reported in detail here for the first time, reveals the extent to which white-collar criminal enforcement has eroded under the Trump administration. The account is based on interviews with current and former Justice Department officials, case records and conversations with people familiar with his case.\n\nThe Trump administration has particularly upended the way tax law violators are handled. Late last year, the administration essentially dissolved the team dedicated to criminal tax enforcement, dividing responsibility among a number of other offices and divisions. Tax prosecutions fell by more than a quarter, and more than a third of the 80 experienced prosecutors working on criminal tax cases have quit.\n\nBut even amid this turmoil, Ver’s case stands out. After Ver added several of these new power brokers to his team — most importantly, former Trump attorney Chris Kise — Trump appointees commandeered the case from career prosecutors. One newly installed Justice Department leader who had previously represented Trump’s family questioned his new subordinates on whether tax evasion should be a criminal offense. Ver’s team wielded unusual control over the final deal, down to dictating that the agreement would not include the word “fraud.”\n\nIt remains the only tax prosecution the administration has killed outright.\n\nVer did not reply to an extensive list of questions from ProPublica. In court filings and dealings with the Justice Department, Ver had always denied dodging his tax bill intentionally — a key distinction between a criminal and civil tax violation — and claimed to have relied on the advice of accountants and tax attorneys.\n\n“Roger Ver took full responsibility for his gross financial misconduct to the tune of $50 million because this Department of Justice did not shy away from exposing those who cheat the system. The notion that any defendant can buy their way out of accountability under this administration is not founded in reality,” said Natalie Baldassarre, a Justice Department spokesperson.\n\nIn response to a list of detailed questions, the White House referred ProPublica to the Justice Department.“I know of no cases like this,” said Scott Schumacher, a former tax prosecutor and the director of the graduate program in taxation at the University of Washington. It is nearly unheard of for the department to abandon an indicted criminal case years in the making. “They’re basically saying you can buy your way out of a tax evasion prosecution.”\n\nRoger Ver is not a longtime ally of Trump’s or a MAGA loyalist. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, a day he once called “the happiest day of my entire life.” In the early days of bitcoin, he controlled about 1% of the world’s supply.\n\nVer is clean-cut and fit — he has a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. In his early 20s, while he was a libertarian activist in California, Ver was sentenced to 10 months in prison for illegally selling explosives on eBay. He’s often characterized that first brush with the law as political persecution by the state. After his release, he left the U.S. for Japan.\n\nVer became a fixture in the 2010s on the budding cryptocurrency conference circuit, where he got a kick out of needling government authority and arguing that crypto was the building block of a libertarian utopia. At a 2017 blockchain conference in Aspen, Colorado, Ver announced he had raised $100 million and was seeking a location to create a new “non-country” without any central government. For years, Ver has recommended other wealthy people consider citizenship in the small Caribbean nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, which has no individual income tax.\n\n“Bitcoin completely undermines the power of every single government on the entire planet to control the money supply, to tax people’s income to control them in any way,” he told a gathering of anarcho-capitalists in Acapulco, Mexico, in 2016. “It makes it so incredibly easy for people to hide their income or evade taxes.” More than one friend, he said with a smirk, had asked him how to do so: They “say, ‘Roger, I need your help. How do I use bitcoins to avoid paying taxes on it?’”\n\nRenouncing U.S. citizenship isn’t a magic get-out-of-tax-free technique. Since 2008, the U.S. has required expatriates with assets above $2 million pay a steep “exit tax” on the appreciation of all their property.\n\nIn 2024, the Justice Department indicted Ver in one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency tax fraud cases. The government accused Ver of lying to the IRS twice. After Ver renounced his citizenship in 2014, he claimed to the IRS that he personally did not own any bitcoin. He would later admit in his deal with the government to owning at least 130,664 bitcoin worth approximately $73.7 million at the time. Then in 2017, the government alleged, Ver tried to conceal the transfer of roughly $240 million in bitcoin from U.S. companies to his personal accounts. In all, the government said he had evaded nearly $50 million in taxes.\n\nVer’s defense was that his failure to pay taxes arose from a lack of clarity as to how tax law treated emerging cryptocurrency, good-faith accounting errors and reliance on his advisors’ advice. He claimed it was difficult to distinguish between his personal assets and his companies’ holdings and pinpoint what the bitcoin was actually worth.\n\nThe Biden administration’s Justice Department dismissed this legal argument. Prosecutors had troves of emails that they said showed Ver misleading his own attorneys and tax preparers about the extent of his bitcoin holdings. (Ver’s team accused the government of taking his statements out of context.) The asset tracing in the case was “rock solid,” according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. A jury, prosecutors maintained, was unlikely to buy Ver’s defense that he made a good-faith error.\n\nIn Trump, Ver saw a possible way out. After the 2024 election, he was “barking up every tree,” said his friend Brock Pierce, a fellow ultrawealthy crypto investor who tried to gin up sympathy for Ver in Trump’s orbit.\n\nVer had initially gone the orthodox route of hiring tax attorneys from a prestigious law firm, Steptoe. Like many wealthy people in legal jeopardy, Ver now also launched a media blitz seeking a pardon from the incoming president.“If anybody knows what it’s like to be the victim of lawfare it’s Trump, so I think he’ll be able to see it in this case as well,” Ver said in a December 2024 appearance on Tucker Carlson’s show. On Charlie Kirk’s show, Ver appeared with tape over his mouth with the word “censored” written in red ink. Laura Loomer, the Trump-friendly influencer, began posting that Ver’s prosecution was unfair. Ver paid Trump insider Roger Stone $600,000 to lobby Congress for an end to the tax provision he was accused of violating.\n\nVer’s pardon campaign fizzled. His public pressure campaign — in which he kept comparing himself to Trump — was not landing, according to Pierce. “You aren’t doing yourself any favors — shut up,” his friend recalled saying.\n\nOne objection in the White House, according to a person who works on pardons, may have been Ver’s flamboyant rejection of his American citizenship. Less than a week after Trump was inaugurated, Elon Musk weighed in, posting on X, “Roger Ver gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges.”\n\nBut inside the Justice Department, Ver found an opening. The skeleton key proved to be one of the “Friends of Trump,” a seasoned defense lawyer named Christopher Kise. Kise is a longtime Florida Republican power player who served as the state’s solicitor general and has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. He earned a place in Trump’s inner circle as one of the first experienced criminal defenders willing to represent the president after his 2020 election loss. Kise defended Trump in the Justice Department investigation stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and against charges that Trump mishandled classified documents when leaving the White House.\n\nKise had worked shoulder-to-shoulder on Trump’s cases with two lawyers who were now leaders in the Trump 2.0 Justice Department: Todd Blanche, who runs day-to-day operations at the department as deputy attorney general, and his associate deputy attorney general, Ketan Bhirud, who oversaw the criminal tax division prosecuting Ver. Kise reportedly helped select Blanche to join Trump’s legal team in the documents case, and he and Bhirud had both worked for Trump’s family as they fought civil fraud charges brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James in 2022.\n\nOn Ver’s legal team, Kise worked the phones, pressing his old colleagues to rethink their prosecution against Ver.\n\nKise scored the legal team’s first big victory in years: a meeting with Bhirud that cut out the career attorneys most familiar with the merits of the case.\n\nIn that meeting, however, it wasn’t clear that the new Justice Department leadership would be willing to interfere with the trajectory of Ver’s case. While the Trump administration had backed off aggressive enforcement of white-collar crimes writ large, the administration said it was still pursuing most criminal cases that had already been charged.\n\nBhirud initially expressed skepticism that Ver accidentally underpaid his taxes. It was “hard to believe” that a man going by “Bitcoin Jesus” would have no idea how much bitcoin he owned, Bhirud said, according to a person familiar with the case.\n\nBhirud and Blanche did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica.\n\nThe Justice Department stuck to its position that either Ver would plead guilty to a crime, or the case would go to trial.\n\nBut Kise would not stop lobbying his former colleagues to reconsider. Blanche and Bhirud had already demanded that career officials justify the case again and again. Over the course of the summer, Kise wore down the Trump appointees’ zeal for pursuing Ver on criminal charges.\n\nKise and the law firm of Steptoe did not respond to questions.\n\n“While there were meetings and conversations with DOJ, that is not uncommon. The line attorneys remained engaged throughout the process, and the case was ultimately resolved based on the strength of the evidence,” said Bryan Skarlatos, one of Ver’s tax attorneys and a partner at Kostelanetz.\n\nIt was a chaotic moment at the Justice Department, an institution that Trump had incessantly accused of being “weaponized” against him and his supporters. After Trump took office, the department was flooded with requests to reconsider prosecutions, with defendants claiming the Biden administration had singled them out for political persecution, too.\n\nWhile many cases failed to grab the administration’s attention, Kise got results. Last week, Kise’s client Julio Herrera Velutini, a Venezuelan-Italian billionaire accused of trying to bribe the former governor of Puerto Rico, received a pardon from Trump.\n\n“Every defense attorney is running the ‘weaponization’ play. This guy gets an audience because of who he is, because his name is Chris Kise,” said a person who recently attended a high-level meeting Kise secured to talk the Justice Department down from prosecuting a client.\n\nAs Kise stepped up the pressure, Ver’s case ate up a significant share of Bhirud’s time, despite his job overseeing more than 1,000 Justice Department attorneys, according to people familiar with the matter. Ordinarily, it would be rare for a political appointee to be so involved, especially to the exclusion of career prosecutors who could weigh in on the merits.\n\nBhirud began to muse to coworkers about whether failure to pay one’s taxes should really be considered a crime. Wasn’t it more of a civil matter? It seemed to a colleague that Bhirud was aware Ver’s advocates could try to elevate the case to the White House.\n\nThe government ceded ground and offered to take prison time off the table. Eventually, Ver’s team and Bhirud hit on the deal that would baffle criminal tax experts. They agreed on a deferred prosecution agreement that would allow Ver to avoid criminal charges and prison in exchange for a payout and an agreement not to violate any more laws. The government usually reserves such an agreement for lawbreaking corporations to avoid putting large employers out of business — not for fugitive billionaires.\n\nVer’s team enjoyed a remarkable ability to dictate terms. They rejected the text of the government’s supposed final offer because it required him to admit to “fraud,” according to a person familiar with the negotiations. In the end, Ver agreed to admit only to a “willful” failure to report and pay taxes on all his bitcoin and turned over the $50 million.\n\nThe government arrived at that figure in a roundabout manner. It dropped its claim that Ver had lied on his 2017 tax return. The $50 million figure was based on how much he had evaded in taxes in 2014 alone, plus what the government asserted were interest and penalties. In the end, the deal amounted to the sum he allegedly owed in the first place. He never even had to leave Mallorca to appear in a U.S. court.\n\nUnder any previous administration, convincing the leadership of the tax division to drop an indicted criminal case and accept a monetary penalty instead would be a nonstarter. While the Justice Department settles most tax matters civilly through fines, when prosecutors do charge criminal fraud, their conviction rate is over 90%.\n\nPeople “always ask you, ‘Can’t I just pay the taxes and it’ll go away?’” said Jack Townsend, a former DOJ tax attorney. “The common answer that everybody gave — until the Trump administration — was that, no, you can’t do that.”\n\nWhen the Justice Department announced the resolution in October, it touted it as a victory.\n\n“We are pleased that Mr. Ver has taken responsibility for his past misconduct and satisfied his obligations to the American public,” Bhirud said in the Justice Department’s press release announcing the deferred prosecution agreement. “This resolution sends a clear message: whether you deal in dollars or digital assets, you must file accurate tax returns and pay what you owe.”\n\nInside the Justice Department, the resolution was demoralizing: “He’s admitted he owes money, and we get money, but everything else about it stinks to high heaven,” said a current DOJ official familiar with the case. “We shouldn’t negotiate with people who are fugitives, as if they have power over us.”\n\nAmong the wealthy targets of white-collar criminal investigations, the Ver affair sent a different message. Lawyers who specialize in that kind of work told ProPublica that more and more clients are asking which of the “Friends of Trump” they should hire. One prominent criminal tax defense lawyer said he would give his clients a copy of Ver’s agreement and tell them, “These are the guys who got this done.”\n\nThe only one of Ver’s many lawyers to sign it was Christopher Kise.",

    "title": "Sucking up CO2, refrigerator-sized machine makes gasoline out of thin air",
    "description": "The Aircela acts like a mini direct air capture facility, sucking up carbon dioxide and then synthesizing it into real, usable gasoline for cars.",
    "fullText": "In 2022, transportation was responsible for an estimated 28 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The majority of those emissions came from everyday gas-powered cars. And while electric vehicles have been heralded as a greener alternative, decades of advocacy and hundreds of billions of dollars in investment have yielded meager results.\n\nToday, electric cars make up just around 8 percent of all vehicles on U.S. roads. (Roughly 90 person of vehicles globally still run on fossil fuels.) Most EVs remain prohibitively expensive for the majority of Americans, and they require enormous amounts of critical minerals—resources that, when extracted at scale, pose their own environmental dilemmas. Most Americans also still just aren’t interested in ditching their gas guzzlers to save the planet.\n\nBut what if they didn’t have to?\n\nThat’s the alluring—if wildly ambitious—vision being presented by New York–based fuels startup Aircela. Earlier this month, the company announced it had created the world’s first functional machine capable of generating real, usable car gasoline “directly from the air.” Aircela’s new device, roughly the size of a commercial refrigerator, combines direct air capture (DAC) with on-site fuel synthesis to create gasoline using just air, water, and renewable energy. No fossil fuels, they say, are required.\n\nThe product their device produces can be poured directly into the tank of any standard gas-powered car. Aircela demonstrated the process, making gasoline directly from air, in front of a live audience in New York. Though most would describe this proof of concept as a “prototype,” company co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren takes some umbrage with that label.\n\n“We didn’t build a prototype. We built a working machine,” Dahlgren said in a statement. “We want people to walk away knowing this isn’t too good to be true—it actually works.”\n\nAircela’s device essentially functions as a compact, portable direct carbon capture facility (DAC) unit. Carbon capture generally refers to the practice of removing carbon dioxide from sources like smokestacks or fossil fuel power plants. Direct air capture, the approach used by Aircela, pulls CO₂ directly from the atmosphere. Europe currently has more than a dozen DAC facilities in operation, and the U.S. federal government is also investing in the technology. Some facilities, such as those run by Climeworks, use large fan-like machines to filter carbon dioxide from the air. Others, like those developed by Carbon Engineering, use chemical mists that bind with CO₂ to extract it. Some researchers are even exploring methods to capture carbon dioxide from the oceans. In most of these cases, the aim is to capture and store the harmful greenhouse gas. Aircela wants to recycle it into cars.\n\nAircela claims its device captures carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and then converts it into gasoline. The resulting fuel doesn’t contain sulfur, ethanol, or heavy metals. Photos of the machine shared by the company show a device composed of three large blue hexagonal units—two side by side on the bottom and one stacked on top. These separate sections handle the stages of air capture and fuel synthesis. On the back of the machine is a standard-looking gasoline nozzle, similar to what you’d find at a gas station. In theory, someone could install one of these units outside their home and use it to refuel their vehicle before heading out for the day. More importantly, it suggests drivers could potentially reduce their environmental impact without needing to change their daily habits.\n\nA spokesperson from Aircela told Popular Science that their machine is designed to capture 10 kgs of CO₂ each day. From that, it can produce 1 gallon of gasoline. The machine can store up to 17 gallons of fuel in its tank. For context, a Toyota Tacoma’s fuel tank has a capacity of 21.1 gallons. In other words, at least in its current form, the device wouldn’t be capable of filling up a car’s tank with gas overnight. The spokesperson didn’t comment on the device’s precise cost but noted that “affordability is essential” to the company’s mission. Aircela is designing the device for mass production, which they believe will drive down costs over time.\n\nThe company reportedly wants to start manufacturing the machine by the fall with an interest in targeting a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial customers.\n\nThe most obvious downside to an approach like this compared to a larger, industrial-scale DAC facility, is sheer impact. A single device, on its own, won’t make a meaningful dent in reducing carbon emissions. But Aircela believes its relatively small size actually makes it less costly and faster to deploy at scale. CEO Eric Dahlgren says the compact form factor gives the technology the flexibility to scale down for individual car owners or scale up for larger clients, such as gas stations or even cargo shipping containers.\n\n“We truly believe that our approach is the fastest way to bring carbon neutral fuels to as many people as possible, to as many places as possible, as soon as possible,” Dahlgren said in a statement.\n\nOf course, that vision also depends entirely on the continued expansion and viability of renewable energy sources. If an Aircela machine uses electricity from a grid powered by natural gas, then not much has really been achieved in terms of carbon reduction. In the U.S., the trend toward renewable energy is strong, though notably less so under the current presidential administration, which has openly embraced the motto“drill baby drill.” Still, Dahlgren says it’s important to approach carbon reduction and environmentalism with a broad perspective and a sense of urgency.\n\n“We cannot wait decades,” Dahlgren added “we need to do something about it right now.”\n\nUpdate, May 28, 2025, 4:23pm ET: This story has been updated to include comments from an Aircela spokesperson.\n\nCorrection, May 29, 2025, 10:09am ET: An earlier version of this story listed the incorrect amount of CO₂ captured per day. It has been updated and we regret the error.",

    "title": "The CEO of a $2 billion healthcare firm only felt rich after he paid off $100K in student loans—but that joy ‘disappeared’ in less than 3 days",
    "description": "Virta Health CEO Sami Inkinen only felt like he “made it” once in 2008, when he was able to pay off $100,000 in debt. He didn’t own a car until he was 37, and is “happy with very little.”",
    "fullText": "When envisioning the CEO of a billion-dollar company, it’s easy to fall victim to the clichés: a well-manicured businessman adorned in designer clothes, jet-setting from one international meeting to the next, a team of assistants in tow. But not every entrepreneur enjoys the spoils of their success with a glitzy lifestyle—some are simply thankful to pay off their student loans.\n\nSerial entrepreneur Sami Inkinen has founded and scaled three different companies—including two unicorns—throughout his 20-year career. While the Virta Health CEO has built wealth thanks to his business success, he isn’t concerned with his net worth. In fact, Inkinen only viewed himself as wealthy when he was able to repay the $100,000 of student debt that was burning a hole in his bank account.\n\n“There’s one moment in my life that I felt rich. And then after that, I’ve never thought of money,” Inkinen tells Fortune. In 2008, three years after Inkinen cofounded real estate search company Trulia, he sold off a batch of secondary shares worth $500,000 pre-tax. “I had enough money to pay all my student debts. I was able to buy whatever I wanted, and it was a very expensive bicycle purchase, [and] furnishing my tiny apartment in San Francisco.”\n\nThe immigrant entrepreneur first made his foray into entrepreneurship with mobile software company Matchem back in 2000 when he was still living in Finland. After two and a half years serving as the cofounder and VP of business development, Inkinen sold the organization for a few million dollars, and uprooted his life in Europe to head to the U.S.\n\nThe Gen X entrepreneur attended Stanford’s MBA program, graduating in 2005 with an advanced business degree and $100,000 of student debt. Consulting giant McKinsey floated him a six-figure job offer, flush with a $10,000 signing bonus. It was a chance for Inkinen to quickly pay off his loans, but he skirted the opportunity and returned to entrepreneurship.\n\nFor the next decade, the entrepreneur helped scale Trulia into an industry staple, before Zillow acquired the company for a whopping $3.5 billion in 2015. Now, Inkinen is 11 years into his third stint as a founder, serving as the CEO of $2 billion healthcare business Virta Health. His student loans are squared away, bills are covered, and housing is fully furnished.\n\nInkinen will always remember the excitement of financial security he felt back in 2008, but stipulates the thrill was fleeting. It’s not in his nature to be “money-driven,” the executive says.\n\n“This feeling of money bringing happiness disappeared in less than two or three days. I was like, ‘Okay, well, it’s nice that I have no debt,’” Inkinen explains. “Money isn’t going to make my life or break it, and it’s not going to bring happiness.”",

    "description": "You can learn to balance at any age, and this squat exercise will help strengthen your lower body muscles and increase mobility to help improve balance over time.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nNot everyone reaches a certain age and struggles with balance. Still, I’ve noticed a common theme among mature clients during workouts or mobility routines: the wobbles. And this is the exercise I always prescribe (injuries permitting).\n\nMaintaining or building balance as you age is a strong indicator of longevity, helping you stay mobile and independent and prevent daily tasks from becoming too difficult. Think about activities you may not even think about: running, walking, climbing the stairs, or lifting one foot to tie up your sneakers.\n\nAs we age, we begin to lose muscle mass and bone density, which means strength, coordination, flexibility and balance are at risk of decline. Did you know that we begin to lose strength and fitness around 35? Yep, you read that right.\n\nBut it’s never too late to get started with exercise; I recommend it to every age category. It can help you reverse aging, maintain lean muscle, build strong bones and increase mobility and flexibility — all of which will keep you stronger for longer.\n\nWant to know the one move I prescribe when I see people struggle with balance? This is it.\n\nWho doesn’t want the balance of a ballet dancer? I’ve seen a few variations of this exercise, but this version involves keeping your heels together and toes opened wide, allowing you to sit back into a squat position while testing hip, knee and ankle mobility. If you prefer, you can walk your heels slightly further apart to begin with, using a wider stance.\n\nI like to add a calf raise for an extra challenge and to work the pretty underused calf muscles in the lower legs, which help you walk and run and contribute to forward propulsion and balance.\n\nThis exercise doesn’t just increase balance, it also builds strength in your inner thighs, quads, hips, glutes (especially the outer glutes), hamstrings, core and calves, making it a lower-body strengthener as well as a mobility exercise.\n\nDuring this exercise, think about keeping the weight in your heels and sitting back as if lowering into a chair behind you. If you find balancing difficult, you may find your body wants to lean forward, making the weight transfer to your toes, so always keep your chest lifted and move with control rather than speed.\n\nStart with your bodyweight, then add dumbbells or kettlebells for added intensity. I like to add a pulse at the bottom, too. Remember, as you drive up to stand, you will lift onto your toes for the calf raise, so try to make this all one fluid movement.\n\nStand with your heels together and toes turned outward. If you would like to, hold a weight to your chest with both hands\n\nEngage your core, then send your hips back and lower into a squat. Try to sit your thighs parallel to the ground or lower if you can\n\nKeep the weight in your heels and track your knees in line with your toes\n\nPause at the bottom, then drive upward to stand and squeeze your glutes. Keep your chest raised and weight in your heels\n\nAs your hips and knees extend, lift onto your toes with control\n\nPause at the top of the calf raise and squeeze your calves, then lower your heels slowly to the ground\n\nIf you can't lower into the squat with your heels together, there's plenty of benefit to walking them further apart. Limited mobility in the hips, knees, ankles, or thoracic spine, or even tight muscles, can inhibit movement.\n\nOne way to determine if your form is correct is to look at your knees. Are they tracking in line with your toes? Good. Are they caving in? Not so good. Try to push them out and squeeze your glutes. As I briefly mentioned above, it's important to stand tall and avoid leaning forward. Always think about the weight distributing across your feet and press into your heels.\n\nWhen I first started training my dad (he's in his seventies), I found he tried to vertically lower into a squat, which meant he could barely squat at all. Instead, I taught him to think about a chair behind him and asked him to try to sit in it. We used a chair on multiple occasions to help him sit his hips back, and this is what I want you to do if you need to.\n\nDid you know that your calves are your second heart?\n\nFinally, let's not forget the calf raises. Did you know that your calves are called your second heart? When working these muscles, the contractions act like a pump to move blood around the body, aiding circulation and reducing the likelihood of swelling or pooling. The more you can keep them active, the better, as they also help you move around, balance and exercise.\n\nAnd let's not forget this is a lower-body strength exercise, building your legs and glutes, which support activity, daily tasks and stability; strong glutes also protect your lower back.\n\nFollow Tom's Guide on Google News and add us as a preferred source to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.\n\nFeeling stiff?

    "fullText": "A common pastime has a hidden impact on the breeding activity of a wild animal species.\n\nA study from the University of Georgia, published in the Journal of Avian Biology, revealed how heavy hunting may be changing turkey populations by influencing the sex of offspring.\n\nThe study analyzed wild turkey populations and found that in areas with high levels of hunting, female turkeys were \"about 23% more likely to have female offspring,\" the University of Georgia reported.\n\nThe findings provide valuable insight into just how deeply overhunting can affect animal populations.\n\nOverhunting can have a significant impact on breeding populations. When higher-quality turkey males are targeted for hunting, only lower-quality males are left for females to mate with — if they even decide to.\n\n\"If there are fewer high-quality males because the best males are harvested, females may not want to mate with the lower quality options,\" Erin Ulrey, Ph.D. candidate at the UGA Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said.\n\n\"That could be an issue over time if male turkeys aren't produced or if it's just female turkeys being born.\"\n\nNot only does overhunting result in fewer turkeys born overall, but it also produces more females, worsening the issue. In the long run, this could reduce genetic diversity and potentially threaten the local population with endangerment or extinction.\n\nTens of thousands of animal species are already considered threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with poaching being a significant driver of extinction, along with habitat loss and pollution.\n\nMeanwhile, a reduction in the turkey population could have a significant negative impact on local ecosystems. The birds help control insect populations and serve as prey for larger animal species.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nMany conservationists are working to tighten restrictions on hunting, such as shortening hunting seasons, hunting pauses during breeding seasons, and lowering the bag limit.\n\nFor critically endangered animals, like rhinos and pangolins, breeding efforts or sanctuaries may be necessary to help the species recover. Donating money to conservation causes can also help protect vulnerable animal populations.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

ICE agents have the power to stop, detain and arrest people they suspect of being in the US illegally.\n\nRenee Good, another Minnesota resident, was shot and killed by an ICE agent on 7 January.\n\n\"Honestly, what I felt was that [the Timberwolves'] group was suffering,\" said Kerr after the Warriors' 111-85 win.\n\n\"It was one of the most bizarre, sad games I've ever been a part of. You could feel the sombre atmosphere.\n\n\"Their team, we could tell they were struggling with everything that's been going on. And what the city has been through. So it was a very sad night.\"\n\nWarriors forward Moses Moody, who scored 19 points with eight rebounds and two blocked shots, said you could \"feel the weight of the city\" during the match, which had been postponed for 24 hours after Pretti's death.\n\n\"I couldn't imagine too many different times where that large amount of people are together in the midst of a situation like this, so you definitely felt that,\" said Moody.\n\nStephen Curry led the scoring for the Warriors with 26 points to climb level with Paul Pierce at 19th on the all-time scoring list - finishing the game with 26,397.\n\nAnthony Edwards scored 32 points and recorded 11 rebounds for the Timberwolves, who lost a fifth-straight match.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Federal immigration agents are top of mind for most of the nation, with no one more affected than the Hispanic population.\n\nOregon is seeing an increase in immigration arrests, with Gov. Tina Kotek noting how people fear going to work or school and to get medical care.\n\nAt the annual Tacos, Tequila and Tamales festival last year at the Expo Center, more than 3,000 guests shopped at 50 different vendors.\n\nBut this year, only 30 vendors showed up. The ones who canceled told organizers they are afraid of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The guest turnout was also slim, with not as many Latino families present compared to last year.\n\nGina Arroyo, owner of Anahi’s Tamales & Tacos, told KOIN 6 News this is a problem now impacting her business all year round.\n\n“Last year we had so many vendors we couldn’t even walk the hallways,” Arroyo said.\n\nShe’s now lost three of her employees that she says are too afraid to leave their homes to come to work.\n\nWomen’s shelter in downtown Portland gets new mural\n\nThe proceeds for the event go to the non-profit organization Latino Leadership NW, which supports young Latino students.\n\n“A lot of people have mentioned when they have called [to] cancel, ‘We don’t want to put our families, we don’t want to put our students in a hurtful, hurtful situation,” said Latino Leadership NW Executive Director Diana Avalos-Leos. “Last year we had more Latino likely families participate, right. We saw the moms and dads and the grandmas and the little babies in strollers. And this year, we’re not seeing, we’re not seeing our families.”\n\nThe fewer customers showing up to festivals like this negatively impacts local businesses, Avalos-Leos said.\n\n“I don’t know nothing about presidents, I don’t know nothing about politics. But I just wish that we were in a safer life, that people don’t be afraid, that my workers can come, that everyone can come and help, you know, just these hateful things to stop,” Arroyo said.\n\nJewelry store owner, Diana Perez, shared the impact on her mental health.\n\n“I’m having nightmares,” she said. “I wake up with heavy breathing and panicking and, at times, I just lose that. I break down.”\n\nLive performers from various schools were also set up to perform at the event on Sunday. But organizers said they too canceled because of fear of deportation.\n\nOther vendors told KOIN 6 News they have friends and family members too scared to go to school and work, saying this fear is impacting the local economy and education. They also wish they saw more support from the community and local lawmakers.\n\nOrganizers said they’re not sure if they will be able to host the event next year, though vendors like Arroyo and others are still holding out hope that the festival can thrive again.",

    "fullText": "I’ve been a games journalist since 2007, but still there isn’t much video games coverage that feels like it’s specifically for people like me. So I’m creating a home for it: Mothership\n\nWhether you’re reading about the impending AI bubble bursting or about the video game industry’s mass layoffs and cancelled projects, 2026 does not feel like a hopeful time for gaming. What’s more, games journalists – as well as all other kinds of journalists – have been losing their jobs at alarming rates, making it difficult to adequately cover these crises. Donald Trump’s White House, meanwhile, is using video game memes as ICE recruitment tools, and game studios are backing away from diversity and inclusion initiatives in response to the wider world’s slide to the right.\n\nThe manosphere is back, and we’ve lost mainstream feminist websites such as Teen Vogue; bigots everywhere are celebrating what they see as the death of “woke”. Put it all together and we have a dismal stew of doom for someone like me, a queer woman and a feminist who’s been a games journalist and critic since 2007.\n\nEverything I just listed off in that paragraph speaks to an urgent need for something different. This is why I’m launching a gender and identity-focused gaming publication called Mothership. It’s independent and worker-owned; it will rely on subscribers’ support to exist. Mothership will focus on reporting on the good and bad of modern-day game-making – alongside investigations, reviews, criticism, and historical deep dives into games and developers who paved the way to now. It will be a website for people who read the news with dread, including gaming news, and worry that Gamergaters got what they always wanted. And it will be a place for readers who wish there was something like a Teen Vogue, but for games (and without a corporate owner to kneecap it).\n\nAfter all, the last two decades have seen a lot of actual, valuable change, and modern games are evidence of that. We exist, now, in a gaming world with more female characters, more non-binary characters, more queer characters, and more characters who don’t fall into rigidly defined gender stereotypes. The GDC State of the Game Industry survey for 2025 found that 66% of surveyed game developers were male, compared with 75% in 2020, and 94% in 2009.\n\nMore people than ever can now see themselves reflected in game characters, and more diverse development teams are creating them. But change has not come easy – and we’ve seen a lot of backlash to this progress. Few websites still in existence are able to cover this backlash while also keeping their reporters safe and motivated to continue.\n\nI have dreamed of founding a website like this for a long time; it’s not as if readers haven’t wanted it before now. The problem I saw with the idea was not that people wouldn’t want it, but rather that I didn’t see a good way to pay for it. Journalism has been facing a monetisation crisis since the advent of the internet. It’s hard to convince readers to pay for something they are used to getting for free.\n\nBut I know the readers are there. In the mid-2010s, I worked for a small “geek girl” feminist website called the Mary Sue, and it was a unique pleasure to write very specific articles for a very specific audience. The Mary Sue relied on advertising income, which meant that all of us had to write up to six articles every weekday; there wasn’t time to spend on investigative reporting, for example, or long-form critical essays. I’m still proud of what we achieved, despite the intensity of those working conditions, not to mention the amount of harassment we faced just for existing. But I always dreamed of working for a place that had the same editorial remit without the harsh working conditions and quotas.\n\nLater, I left the Mary Sue and went on to work for Kotaku and then Polygon, both huge games websites where I was writing for broader audiences, rather than the hyper-specific one we catered to at the Mary Sue. As I watched many smaller games websites crumble over the course of the 2010s and 20s, I figured this was the only type of games website that was going to survive. The idea of working for a small, feminist games website – my dream – increasingly looked like an impossible speck of starlight in a far-off galaxy.\n\nBut then, in the summer of 2025, my then-employer Polygon underwent a mass layoff and acquisition. We went from a staff of 42 people to just eight. After a particularly disheartening video call with our website’s new owners, I realised I was going to have to quit. Every piece of the dream felt well and truly dead. I had not got into journalism to be taken advantage of by people who saw me and my colleagues as so easily replaceable as to be barely human.\n\nAnother one of my colleagues at Polygon – Zoe Hannah, games editor – quit as well, for similar reasons. She hit me up with an idea she had for a feminist games website. “You should do it,” I told her. And then I sat there for a moment and thought about it. No, we should do it! This was what I had wanted to do, before the industry had transformed me into someone so gnarled and jaded that I no longer believed it was even possible.\n\nSix months on, after many DMs with former colleagues from Polygon, the Mary Sue and Kotaku, plus other notable writers who’ve covered gender and identity in games – Zoe and I are launching Mothership together, today. We have had the benefit of advice and inspiration from many other independent, worker-owned outlets that have come before us, such as Defector, the Flytrap, and Aftermath. Already, we’ve surpassed 1,200 paid subscribers. (I knew the readers were there.) And we don’t need millions of them. Mothership is a publication for a very specific audience: the people who don’t fit the mould of the masculine, hardcore gamer image that marketing and pop culture have been dishing out since the 90s. We want to serve this audience well.\n\nI believe our website is a necessity in our current political climate. It should have existed before, when I and millions of other girls who grew up playing games were made to feel out of place by media and advertising that was laser-focused on teenage boys. But it’s not too late for me to make sure it exists now.",

    "fullText": "Synthesia makes digital presenters for clients to use in corporate videos and counts 70% of FTSE 100 as customers\n\nA British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.\n\nSynthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.\n\nOn Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.\n\nSynthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.\n\nThe company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.\n\nThe startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.\n\nSynthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”\n\nLast year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.\n\n“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.\n\nSynthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.\n\nThe $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.\n\nSynthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.\n\nLast year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.\n\nTjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.",

    "fullText": "Investigation comes after Elon Musk’s firm sparked outrage by allowing users to ‘strip’ photos of women and children\n\nThe European Commission has launched an investigation into Elon Musk’s X over the production of sexually explicit images and the spreading of possible child sexual abuse material by the platform’s AI chatbot feature, Grok.\n\nThe formal inquiry, launched on Monday, also extends an investigation into X’s recommender systems, algorithms that help users discover new content.\n\nGrok has sparked international outrage by allowing users to digitally strip women and children and put them into provocative poses. Grok AI generated about 3m sexualised images in less than two weeks, including 23,000 that appeared to depict children, according to researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate.\n\nThe commission said its new investigation would “assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks” stemming from Grok’s functionalities in the EU, including risks on the sharing of illegal content such as manipulated sexually explicit images and “content that may amount to” child sexual abuse material.\n\nThe investigation is launched under the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), a relatively new piece of legislation that is intended to protect internet users from a wide range of harms.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, an official said the commission had not been convinced by mitigating measures put in place by X to remedy the issue. EU officials are investigating whether X has systems to mitigate risks properly.\n\nAnnouncing the investigation, Henna Virkkunen, the commission’s top official for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said: “Non-consensual sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations under the DSA, or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.”\n\nRegina Doherty, an Irish MEP, said she welcomed the formal investigation. “When credible reports emerge of AI systems being used in ways that harm women and children, it is essential that EU law is examined and enforced without delay,” Doherty said.\n\nIn response to the investigation, X provided a link to a statement it published on 14 January: “We remain committed to making X a safe platform for everyone and continue to have zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, non-consensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.”",

    "fullText": "Survey reveals ‘mismatched AI expectations’ between views of employers and staff over impact on careers\n\nAI is hitting UK harder than other big economies, study finds\n\nMore than a quarter (27%) of UK workers are worried their jobs could disappear in the next five years as a result of AI, according to a survey of thousands of employees.\n\nTwo-thirds (66%) of UK employers reported having invested in AI in the past 12 months, according to the international recruitment company Randstad’s annual review of the world of work, while more than half (56%) of workers said more companies were encouraging the use of AI tools in the workplace.\n\nThis was leading to “mismatched AI expectations” between the views of employees and their employers over the impact of AI on jobs, according to Randstad’s poll of 27,000 workers and 1,225 organisations across 35 countries. Just under half (45%) of UK office workers surveyed believed AI would benefit companies more than employees.\n\nYounger workers, particularly those belonging to gen Z – born between 1997 and 2012 – were the most concerned about the impact of AI and their ability to adapt, while baby boomers – born in the postwar years between 1946 and 1964 and nearing the end of their careers – showed greater self-assurance.\n\nHigher levels of concern expressed by young people entering the workforce could stem from the decision of many business leaders, highlighted by separate research, to invest in AI to plug skills gaps through automation instead of training up new hires. This is adding to the challenges facing younger workers at a time when the labour market is cooling.\n\nIncreased use of AI and automation in businesses is increasingly replacing “low-complexity, transactional roles”, the survey showed, which could help to address labour shortages in certain industries through boosting productivity.\n\nAbout half (55%) of UK workers surveyed said AI had made a positive impact on their productivity, a view echoed by employers.\n\n“AI is not a rival to labour; it should be seen as key to augmenting tasks and highlighting the importance of roles that only people can do,” said Sander van ‘t Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad.\n\n“We must close the ‘AI reality gap’. While businesses race to embrace a new way of working, our data shows that one in five talent believe AI will have a limited impact on their tasks and nearly half perceive it as more beneficial to the company than themselves. This leaves them vulnerable in both their careers and the value they can add to organisations.”\n\nThe pace of adoption of AI in the workplace is also having an impact on workers around the world. Four in five workers believe AI will affect their daily work tasks, while the survey found that job vacancies requiring “AI agent” skills had risen by 1,587% over the past year.\n\nJamie Dimon, the boss of the US bank JP Morgan, told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk “civil unrest”.",

    "fullText": "Bridget Phillipson says pupils should not use mobiles at any point, as Ofsted prepares to inspect compliance\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nSchools should be phone-free throughout the entire day, the education secretary has told headteachers in England, stressing that pupils should not use the devices even as calculators or for research.\n\nBridget Phillipson wrote to schools to underline updated guidance issued by the government last week, according to the BBC. “Schools should make sure those policies are applied consistently across classes, and at all times and we want parents to back these policies too,” Phillipson said.\n\nTeachers were also advised not to use their phones in front of pupils.\n\nPhillipson said Ofsted, the schools watchdog, would inspect how schools implemented the policy, while the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said it would take immediate action on children’s social media use.\n\nThe updated guidance states that pupils “should not have access to their devices during lessons, break times, lunchtimes or between lessons”.\n\nDSIT data shows 99.9% of primary schools and 90% of secondary schools already have mobile phone policies. However, 58% of secondary school pupils reported phones being used without permission in some lessons, rising to 65% among key stage four pupils.\n\nPaul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told the BBC school leaders “need support from government, not the threat of heavy-handed inspection”.\n\nThe move comes as ministers consult on introducing an Australian-style social media ban for under-16s in the UK. Options include raising the digital age of consent and restricting potentially addictive app design features such as “streaks” and “infinite scrolling”.\n\nMinisters will visit Australia, where a ban came into force in December. The government will seek views from parents and young people and will respond in the summer, according to DSIT.\n\nLast week, the House of Lords backed a Conservative-led amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that proposed such a ban, despite it not being supported by the government.\n\nWhile ministers’ plans to bring forward legislation mean the amendment is unlikely to survive in the Commons, its passage in the upper chamber has increased pressure on the prime minister to act more quickly and decisively. Keir Starmer is understood to want to wait for evidence from Australia’s ban.",

    "fullText": "Molly Russell was just 14 when she took her own life in 2017, and an inquest later found negative online content was a significant factor. With many people now pushing for teenagers to be kept off tech platforms, her father explains why he backs a different approach\n\nIan Russell describes his life as being split into two parts: before and after 20 November 2017, the day his youngest daughter, Molly, took her own life as a result of depression and negative social media content. “Our life before Molly’s death was very ordinary. Unremarkable,” he says. He was a television producer and director, married with three daughters. “We lived in an ordinary London suburb, in an ordinary semi-detached house, the children went to ordinary schools.” The weekend before Molly’s death, they had a celebration for all three girls’ birthdays, which are in November. One was turning 21, another 18 and Molly was soon to be 15. “And I remember being in the kitchen of a house full of friends and family and thinking, ‘This is so good. I’ve never been so happy,’” he says. “That was on a Saturday night and the following Tuesday morning, everything was different.”\n\nThe second part of Russell’s life has been not only grief and trauma, but also a commitment to discovering and exposing the truth about the online content that contributed to Molly’s death, and campaigning to prevent others falling prey to the same harms. Both elements lasted far longer than he anticipated. It took nearly five years to get enough information out of social media companies for an inquest to conclude that Molly died “from an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content”. As for the campaigning, the Molly Rose Foundation provides support, conducts research and raises awareness of online harms, and Russell has been an omnipresent spokesperson on these issues.\n\nHe has been busier than ever lately. We meet at a London hotel, a few hours before the House of Lords vote on an amendment to the children’s wellbeing and schools bill that would ban access to social media for under-16s. The amendment was expected to pass – and it did, by 261 votes to 150. Keir Starmer’s government is in favour of a consultation, and a pause to see how Australia’s trailblazing unfolds. But a UK ban has had widespread support, from Conservatives, including Kemi Badenoch, as well as more than 60 Labour MPs, bereaved relatives of children whose deaths were social media-related, celebrities, campaign groups and, it seems, the public – a YouGov poll in December found that 74% of British adults were in favour.\n\nRussell, however, is not in favour of such a ban. Last Sunday he co-signed a joint statement, alongside the NSPCC, Full Fact, the 5 Rights Foundation and others, arguing that “blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children’s safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need”.\n\nAn inconvenient split seems to have opened up, at a time when online harms and social media companies are finally in the spotlight. But if anyone has spent time weighing up this issue, it’s Russell, and he doesn’t seem like someone looking for controversy. “As a person, I need to gather information and process it before I can come to a conclusion,” he says. “I often find myself at meetings hearing what’s being said, and it can be difficult to contribute because I haven’t formed my opinions yet.” But on this issue he’s firm in his conviction, even if others find it difficult to understand. “We’re in danger of trying to move too fast and trying to find quick-fix solutions,” he says. “If there were quick-fix solutions, honestly, we would have found them.”\n\nThe core arguments laid out by Russell and other opponents of a ban will be familiar to followers of this debate: that children will seek more dangerous alternatives; that they will find ways to circumvent age limits; that they will face a “cliff edge” when they turn 16 and are thrown into the “high-risk” world of social media; that some groups, such as LGBTQ+ and neurodiverse children, will be deprived of valuable online sources of support and connection.\n\nBut Russell’s position also hinges on the Online Safety Act, which is just starting to do what it’s supposed to, he argues. The legislation, passed in 2023, obliges online platforms to conduct robust age verification and prevent harmful content reaching children. It also gives the government and Ofcom, the independent media regulator, powers to fine or even take down platforms not playing by the rules. Molly’s death, and Russell’s campaigning, helped push the act through.\n\nRussell admits progress has been slow. “It took five years of parliamentary debate to put the Online Safety Act on the books. It’s taken Ofcom more than two years, but they are now implementing and enforcing that act. It’s too long, but we have literally just arrived at a place, after all that time, when the platforms, in order to operate in the UK, if their services are likely to be used by children, have to take steps to ensure the safety of those children.”\n\nThe recent furore over Elon Musk’s X and Grok is a good illustration, he says. The integration of Grok AI tools that could manipulate images of women, and even children, to remove their clothing, into X – effectively making a tool for creating deepfake child sexual abuse images widely available – horrified pretty much everyone, Russell included. “I don’t understand how X and Elon Musk can even begin to think that that was acceptable,” he says. “Hideous, wrong, disgraceful. But what was the reaction in the UK to that?” After the issue became known, Ofcom opened a formal investigation into X, acting under the powers of the Online Safety Act. Starmer and technology secretary Liz Kendall said they would support Ofcom if it chose to fine or block ​X. Within days, Musk made a U-turn and removed the software from his platform.\n\nThe Online Safety Act did what a social media ban couldn’t, Russell argues. “If a platform is behaving in an appalling, unsatisfactory, abysmally unsafe manner, it shouldn’t be in this country … A ban [for under-16s] removes the impetus to do that. In fact, what it’s likely to do is have a really chilling effect on the Online Safety Act.”\n\nHe’s not arguing that the legislation is perfect – X was still allowing some users to post sexualised images generated by Grok after Musk’s U-turn, it took weeks for Ofcom to act, and X escaped censure for what many still consider an egregious offence – “but it’s there to be built on. You don’t get anything right the first time … You also have to accept that the development of tech moves so fast, you’re going to constantly have to be amending it and looking at it and updating it. We have to be thinking ahead of the tech crowd.”\n\nA common argument in favour of a social media ban for under-16s is the alcohol analogy. We don’t sanction selling alcohol to minors because it is potentially harmful. Sure, some kids might find a way around it, like getting a fake driving licence, but as a society we’ve put down a marker that you have to be a certain age to drink. Shouldn’t it be the same with social media?\n\nRussell is in favour of regulation, but says it should be sensible and proportionate. He counters with another offline analogy: cars and road traffic. “There will be casualties. It’s sad and tragic when it happens, and we accept that. We don’t say: children under 16 shouldn’t ride in cars to protect them. We say children under 12 should always be in a car seat. We say that everyone in a car, however old, should wear a seatbelt. The industry is compelled to comply with safety measures … We don’t blanket ban 16-year-olds from road travel.”\n\nWe do ban them from driving though, I point out. “I’m not saying we should let 16-year-olds on platforms that encourage irresponsible behaviour. I’m saying we should let 16-year-olds on platforms that are safe for 16-year-olds.”\n\nAge classification should be on a platform-by-platform basis, in Russell’s view: “If there was a platform that was really safe, really good, and connected people and did all the good things that social media could do, we could say 13 is fine.” Some other platforms might be rated 16 or 18, say. “If you were to differentiate like that, you would then drive platforms who wanted to attract younger people [to] start inventing safer things.”\n\nSome might say social media companies have had every chance to do this already. Instead, despite having been repeatedly confronted with evidence of the harms they have caused, they have routinely denied and evaded accountability, and even scaled down their internal checks and balances. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for example, apologised to parents of social media victims at a Senate hearing in January 2024, but a year later, following Donald Trump’s re-election, he announced that Instagram, Facebook and Threads would be getting rid of factcheckers, even if, he admitted, “it means we’re gonna catch less bad stuff”.\n\n“I don’t trust the platforms at all,” Russell agrees. “You certainly can’t judge a social media platform by what it says; you can only judge by what it does.” And again, he argues, the Online Safety Act is a better weapon to keep them in line. “If you’ve got an effective regulator and strong regulation, then you could go, ‘You’re not doing what you’re telling us you’re doing. You’re not living up to your risk assessment. You’ve got three months to fix it, or you’re out.’ That’s the sort of thing that will make a difference.”\n\nRussell has good reason not to trust the platforms, especially Meta. After Molly’s death, Russell and his family were shocked and confused, until they began to look into her online activity. “We discovered, in a really painful way, because we could see it in her social media accounts, the content that had been fed to her by the platforms.” The feedback loop of the algorithm had served her more and more disturbing content: graphic images and videos relating to suicide, self-harm and depression, often set to music, flashing slogans like “Fat. Ugly. Worthless. Suicidal.” Even a consultant psychiatrist at the inquest into Molly’s death said that they’d had trouble sleeping after viewing it. “That discovery of this awful, nihilistic world in which she was drip-fed largely black-and-white, depressive content, that led her to the place where she thought that the only way forward was to end her life, was horrifying,” Russell says.\n\nInitially, they reported their findings to Instagram, he recalls. “We thought that they’d say, ‘Thank you for reporting this horrible content. We’ll take it down.’” Instead they received replies along the lines of “this doesn’t infringe our community guidelines”.\n\nGetting a complete picture of Molly’s online activity was a long, difficult, painful process. Cooperation from the tech companies was minimal, but Andrew Walker, the senior coroner at the inquest, was tenacious. Pinterest, which had algorithmically sent harmful content to Molly, complied. Twitter (now X) allowed Russell to download the data from Molly’s account, which wasn’t that helpful without the background context. Meta initially supplied tens of thousands of pages of data, which was all but unsearchable. After more demands, delays and ultimatums, eventually, five years after Molly’s death, Meta found an additional 50 lever-arch files of evidence. “Within that evidence was some of the most harmful content that Molly had seen, which completed the picture.” In her final six months, Molly had been exposed to 2,100 pieces of harmful content on Instagram alone. There were only 12 days in that period when she doesn’t seem to have interacted with harmful content on the platform.\n\nA new documentary premiering next month, Molly vs The Machines, combines verbatim reconstructions of moments from the inquest (such as when one Meta executive disputed whether the content Molly was consuming was really harmful at all) and interviews with Russell and Molly’s schoolfriends with a broader critique of big tech and surveillance capitalism: infinite scrolling, engagement-seeking algorithms, misinformation, polarisation – this is not just a problem for teenagers, Russell points out. “There’s an online harm working at the global level, and there’s an online harm working at the personal level that Molly experienced. The two are so interconnected, and we need to collectively work to pull that together.”\n\nThe fact that this debate has become polarised is, if not a direct consequence, then at least a reflection of how social media tends to drag every subject to its extremes. The politicisation of the issue is equally unhelpful in this regard: the Lords amendment (which now returns to the House of Commons for consideration) was led by the Tories, and is being seen as a defeat for Starmer’s government. Lady Kidron described Starmer’s stance as “the very epitome of party before country”.\n\nBut Russell is all for finding middle ground. “I know it will suit many people to divide the cake and say there’s pro-ban and there’s anti-ban. And they can try to set us against each other if they want, and that might work in some cases. In my case, I’ll never be against anyone; I always want to hear their arguments. The division shouldn’t be there; the division should be: people who want the world to be safer for children; and technology companies who are absolutely uncaring of that and caring of their profits – that’s where the dividing line is.”\n\nOn a personal level, can Russell imagine reaching a point where he’ll think his work is done? “I’ve always wanted to just get on with my very ordinary life and remember Molly fondly. But sadly, I don’t see that happening anytime soon, because this is a global problem.” He has tried to keep his life and career as ordinary and unchanged as it was, “so there was something familiar in that second part of my life after Molly’s death.” Russell’s work and his grief are inevitably intertwined. There’s not a day he doesn’t think about her, he says. “Some days, that can invigorate you and it can be tremendously powerful and comforting. And other days it can absolutely stop you in your steps and you can barely bring yourself to come out the door. As time goes on, the harder days are fewer.”",

    "fullText": "Britain is losing more jobs than it creates owing to artificial intelligence, Morgan Stanley research suggests\n\nMore than a quarter of Britons fear losing job to AI in next five years\n\nThe UK is losing more jobs than it is creating because of artificial intelligence and is being hit harder than rival large economies, new research suggests.\n\nBritish companies reported that AI had resulted in net job losses over the past 12 months, down 8% – the highest rate among other leading economies including the US, Japan, Germany and Australia, according to a study by the investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe research, which was shared with Bloomberg, surveyed companies using AI for at least a year across five industries: consumer staples and retail, real estate, transport, healthcare equipment and cars.\n\nIt found that British businesses reported an average 11.5% increase in productivity aided by AI. US businesses reported similar gains, but created more jobs than they cut.\n\nIt suggests UK workers are being hit particularly hard by the rise of AI, as higher costs and taxes also weigh on the job market.\n\nUnemployment is at a four-year high, as rises in the minimum wage and employer national insurance contributions squeeze hiring.\n\nMore than a quarter of UK workers are now worried their jobs could disappear completely in the next five years due to AI, a survey by the international recruitment company Randstad found.\n\nYounger workers, particularly those in gen Z, were most concerned about the impact of AI and their ability to adapt, while baby boomers – born in the postwar years between 1946 and 1964 and nearing the end of their careers – showed greater self-assurance.\n\nThe businesses surveyed by Morgan Stanley said they were most likely to cut early-career jobs, requiring two to five years of experience in the UK.\n\nEarlier this month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned that AI could destroy swathes of jobs in the capital and “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nIn his annual Mansion House speech, Khan said London is “at the sharpest edge of change” because of its reliance on white-collar workers in the finance and creative industries, and professional services such as law, accounting, consulting and marketing.\n\nKhan argued that “we have a moral, social and economic duty to act” to ensure that new jobs are created to replace those that will disappear, with entry-level and junior jobs the first to go.\n\nLast week Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US bank JP Morgan, told the World Economic Forum in Davos that governments and businesses would have to step in to help workers whose roles were displaced by the technology, or risk civil unrest.",

    "fullText": "Venezuela’s acting president Delcy Rodríguez said Sunday she has had “enough” of Washington’s orders, as she works to unite the country after the US capture of its former leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nRodríguez has been walking a tight-rope since being backed by the US to lead the country in the interim; balancing keeping Maduro loyalists on board at home while trying to ensure the White House is happy.\n\nNow, almost a month into her new role, Rodríguez has pushed back on the US, amid ongoing pressure including a series of demands for Venezuela to resume oil production.\n\n“Enough already of Washington’s orders over politicians in Venezuela,” she told a group of oil workers in Puerto La Cruz city, at an event broadcast by state-run channel Venezolana de Televisión.\n\n“Let Venezuelan politics resolve our differences and our internal conflicts. This Republic has paid a very high price for having to confront the consequences of fascism and extremism in our country.”\n\nThe White House has maintained steady pressure on Venezuela since Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized in a raid in early January and taken to the US, where the former leader is facing charges.\n\nRodríguez, Maduro’s former deputy, has insisted in recent weeks that the US does not govern Venezuela but, equally, has not sought confrontation with Washington.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had claimed the US was “going to run” Venezuela in the immediate aftermath of Maduro’s capture, but he later backed Rodríguez as the country’s interim leader.\n\nCNN has contacted the White House for comment on Rodríguez’s latest statement.\n\nFor the past 25 years, oil-rich socialist Venezuela has been in constant confrontation with the US. But after deposing Maduro, Washington is now seeking to secure a stable source of authority in Caracas.\n\nInternally, the country remains divided among Maduro loyalists, left-wing opposition and “Chavistas No-Maduristas” – supporters of the late Hugo Chávez who reject Maduro, accusing him of betraying 21st-century socialist ideals.\n\nDays after the US strikes on Caracas in early January, the Trump administration outlined a number of demands that Venezuela must agree to, including cutting ties with China, Iran, Russia and Cuba, and agreeing to partner exclusively with the US on oil production, two senior White House officials told CNN at the time.\n\nRodríguez was also expected to prioritize the Trump administration and US oil companies for future oil sales.\n\nVenezuela’s main economic driver is oil. The country has the world’s largest reserves of extra-heavy crude, a variety that requires a more complex and expensive refining process but which is also compatible with US refineries.\n\nCNN’s Ivonne Valdes Garay, Isabelle D’Antonio, Rocio Muñoz-Ledo and Mauricio Torres contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump may still dominate the news cycle, but inside the White House, the foundations of his power are weakening—and he knows it, according to Trump’s biographer.\n\nOn the latest episode of Inside Trump’s Head, author Michael Wolff described a White House increasingly gripped by anxiety as the president enters a pivotal midterm year burdened by collapsing polls, international resistance, self-inflicted crises that refuse to fade, and growing alarm among aides that Trump is losing interest in the presidency.\n\n“If you lose Donald Trump’s interest, you lose Donald Trump,” Wolff said.\n\n“He’s not interested in policy. He’s not interested in bureaucracy. He’s interested in unfettered attention.”\n\nAccording to Wolff, the daily work of governing—incremental wins, trade-offs, and detail—bores Trump, draining his energy at a moment when political discipline matters most.\n\nThat disengagement has become increasingly visible on the world stage. After heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos expecting to be treated as an untouchable strongman, Trump instead encountered coordinated resistance from allies who, Wolff argued, are no longer content to maneuver quietly around him.\n\n“Trump’s virtue to voters is that no matter what happened, he looked strong,” Wolff told co-host Joanna Coles.\n\n“Now he cannot take Greenland, he cannot take Canada, he cannot do any of the things that he has huffed and puffed and said he will do.”\n\nWolff said the same pattern is playing out at home, where the administration has struggled to contain the fallout in Minneapolis following two fatal encounters involving federal immigration officers this month, further inflaming protests and political backlash.\n\n“This has now become a very, very complicated situation,” Wolff said.\n\nFor Trump, Minneapolis represents the kind of crisis he finds hardest to manage: one that can’t be bullied into submission or drowned out by spectacle.\n\n“He cannot threaten his way out of it,” Wolff said.\n\n“He can’t seem to generate a new headline to get himself out of it,” he continued. “The headlines that are generated are bad headlines.”\n\nThat dynamic, Wolff argued, points to a broader problem for Trump as the midterms approach. Governing, he said, demands a tolerance for incremental progress, which is at odds with Trump’s appetite for dominance and immediate results.\n\n“The work of the presidency does not inspire him,” Wolff said.\n\n“If it becomes complicated, that has to be pushed to the side.”\n\nAs Trump disengages, Wolff went on to say, the president has increasingly turned to performative conflict, including high-profile lawsuits and public feuds with powerful institutions. Once effective at projecting strength, those tactics now risk reinforcing the impression of a leader struggling to maintain control.\n\n“There’s only so many times you can sue people for $5 billion or $20 billion,” Wolff said. “You look foolish.”\n\nWith a little over nine months until the midterm elections, Wolff framed the moment as a genuine inflection point—not just for Republicans, but for Trump himself.\n\n“We’re in the middle of a pivotal campaign,” Wolff said.\n\n“Conceivably one of the most important campaigns ever waged. This is potentially, in November, the end of Donald Trump.”\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast: “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nFind and New episodes of incomparable insight into the psyche of the world’s most talked-about man drop every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evening on YouTube and Wednesday and Friday mornings on other podcast platforms.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI/BRUSSELS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - India plans to slash tariffs on cars imported from the European Union to 40% from as high as 110%, sources said, in the biggest opening yet of the country's vast ​market as the two sides close in on a free trade pact that could come as early as Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister ‌Narendra Modi's government has agreed to immediately reduce the tax on a limited number of cars from the 27-nation bloc with an import price of more than 15,000 euros ($17,739), ‌two sources briefed on the talks told Reuters.\n\nThis will be further lowered to 10% over time, they added, easing access to the Indian market for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.\n\nThe sources declined to be identified as the talks are confidential and could be subject to last-minute changes. India's commerce ministry and the European Commission declined to comment.\n\nPACT ALREADY DUBBED 'MOTHER OF ALL DEALS'\n\nIndia and the EU are expected to announce on Tuesday the ⁠conclusion of protracted negotiations for the free trade ‌pact, after which the two sides will finalise the details and ratify what is being called \"the mother of all deals.\n\nThe pact could expand bilateral trade and lift Indian exports of goods such as textiles and jewellery, which ‍have been hit by 50% U.S. tariffs since late August.\n\nIndia is the world's third-largest car market by sales after the U.S. and China, but its domestic auto industry has been one of the most protected. New Delhi currently levies tariffs of 70% and 110% on imported cars, a level often criticised by executives, ​including Tesla chief Elon Musk.\n\nNew Delhi has proposed slashing import duties to 40% immediately for about 200,000 combustion-engine cars a year, one ‌of the sources said, its most aggressive move yet to open up the sector. This quota could be subject to last-minute changes, the source added.\n\nBattery electric vehicles will be excluded from import duty reductions for the first five years to protect investments by domestic players like Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors in the nascent sector, the two sources said. After five years EVs will follow similar duty cuts.\n\nMARKET CURRENTLY DOMINATED BY SUZUKI AND LOCAL MAKERS\n\nLower import taxes will be a boost for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis, as well as luxury players ⁠Mercedes-Benz and BMW which locally manufacture cars in India but have struggled to grow ​beyond a point in part due to high tariffs.\n\nLower taxes will allow carmakers to ​sell imported vehicles for a cheaper price and test the market with a broader portfolio before committing to manufacturing more cars locally, said one of the two sources.",

The military's position is based on the fact that China has never abandoned the use of force against Taiwan,\" Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington ⁠Koo told reporters at parliament.\n\nZhang has ‌long been seen as Xi's closest military ally, and is one of the few senior Chinese officers with combat experience, having taken part in the 1979 border ‍conflict with Vietnam.\n\nChina, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, sends warplanes and warships into the skies and waters around the island on an almost daily basis, in what Taipei views as a harassment campaign to ​get the government to accept Beijing's sovereignty claims.\n\nKoo said what the ministry was looking at is ‌not any \"single leadership reshuffle that would be enough to draw conclusions\".\n\nTaiwan will use a range of joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance methods, as well as intelligence-sharing, to \"grasp\" China's possible intentions, he added.\n\nChina has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and held its latest round of war games around the island late last month. Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their ⁠future.\n\nSpeaking later in the day to lawmakers, Koo said it ​was clear that the Chinese threat was worsening, pointing to ​the war games, daily military activities and ongoing rise in China's defence spending, and Taiwan cannot let down its guard.\n\n\"We won't let the downfall of any one person ‍make us lower our guard ⁠or slacken the level of war preparedness we should maintain,\" he added.\n\nTaiwan will exchange intelligence with its partners on what changes may be taking places in China's military command structure, Koo ⁠said.\n\n\"Regarding the threat to us, we need to focus on early-warning indicators and signs. This has to be continuous not ‌only on the military side but also on the non-military side.\"",

    "description": "The Unmanned Systems Forces' commander said his units' average engagement distance against Russian soldiers is less than 1 mile from the contact line.",
    "fullText": "A drone commander said his elite pilots have recently been hitting Russian infantry at close range.\n\nOn average, they've been attacking troops 0.89 miles from the contact line, Robert \"Madyar\" Brovdi said.\n\nHis 12 elite drone crews have been increasingly deployed to hit infantry over the last month, he added.\n\nThe leader of Ukraine's special drone branch said his operators are striking advancing Russian infantry at extreme close range, providing rare insight into how some of the country's best pilots are fighting.\n\nMaj. Robert \"Madyar\" Brovdi, the commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, wrote in a statement on Sunday that his pilots have, over the last month, been engaging enemy troops at an average strike depth of 1.44 km, or 0.89 miles, from the line of contact.\n\nThat's a roughly 15-minute brisk walk for the average person.\n\n\"This figure fluctuates, but: We are literally working under our feet,\" Madyar wrote.\n\nHis remarks reflect how top Ukrainian commanders in some areas have been prioritizing their limited resources. Using elite strike crews for short-range suppression could also be a sign of heightened pressure on Ukrainian lines.\n\nThe Unmanned Systems Forces is a relatively new elite formation in Ukraine that focuses on providing strike or reconnaissance support with smaller drones. Madyar, a prominent drone unit commander appointed to lead the group in June 2025, said on Sunday that his branch comprises 12 combat crews who are present on 30% of the front line.\n\nRussia relies on ground infantry assaults to gradually take territory in Ukraine, and has been aggressively attempting to advance along some key frontline areas in recent months.\n\nMadyar wrote that his units are assigned to corps commanders, who have been deploying the operators to attack such advancing troops at closer range.\n\n\"Not a single Corps commander, who has many hundreds of crews from their own brigades and subordinate units within their area of responsibility, is ready to release SBS work to proper depth,\" Madyar wrote, referring to the Unmanned Systems Forces as the SBS.\n\nHe added that this was due to Ukrainian commanders wanting to protect their troops in the trenches.\n\nFor Ukrainian soldiers, being sent to hold a trench is one of the war's most high-casualty tasks. They're often outnumbered by waves of attacking Russian troops, and typically need the help of friendly drone pilots to thwart assaults before they can get close.\n\nBut ideally, these drone operators try to spot and engage enemy infantry farther away, roughly 6 to 10 miles from the line of contact, as these troops form up or begin to launch assaults.\n\n\"To systematically reach proper depth, it is necessary to manage to create new crews, at least three times more than the current number,\" Madyar wrote. \"The existing ones, for the most part, will remain in tactical depth.\"\n\nMadyar also said infantry strikes have recently accounted for a larger share of his units' time.\n\nAccording to him, the SBS has a usual goal of targeting infantry in 30% of its strikes, but nearly 40% of its successful attacks in December were against infantry, involving roughly 12,000 Russian soldiers.\n\nStill, the commander wrote that in the SBS' entire history, the majority of its engagements have been against Russian equipment and logistics routes, at ranges of roughly 2.3 miles to 9.2 miles, depending on the type of system targeted.\n\nMadyar's branch has struck over 1,200 \"launch points\" for Russian drone pilots, at an average depth of 2.25 miles, he added.\n\nElite drone units typically make a name for themselves by using small, inexpensive drones to strike priority air defense systems, logistics routes, or command posts deep behind enemy lines.\n\nIndeed, Madyar had posted his statement on Sunday in response to what he said were recent criticisms that his units were focusing too much on strikes against Russian soldiers.\n\nMadyar also wrote that not all SBS crews are equally contributing to these strike statistics.\n\n\"Only six to seven out of 12 SBS units are working at the desired pace; the others are catching up and need more time,\" his statement said.",

    "description": "An imitation pipe bomb topped the list, followed by turtles stashed away in a bra and pair of pants",
    "fullText": "An imitation pipe bomb topped the list of most unusual things confiscated at US airports by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers in 2025, just beating out turtles stashed away in a bra and a pair of pants, according to agency officials.\n\nThe TSA recently published the list in a video on YouTube as well as in a press release that drew attention in corners of the internet dedicated to offbeat news items.\n\nOfficers detected the fake pipe bomb in question in a checked bag at the airport in Boise, Idaho, in May, the press release said. The prop – made of PVC pipes, protruding wires, and wooden blocks wrapped in paper and marked “C4” – triggered a checkpoint alarm. But an explosives specialist who investigated the alarm determined it was all a replica rather than a genuine threat.\n\nThe traveler told officials the fake pipe bomb was a training aid, and he chose to abandon it with TSA officers.\n\n“Realistic replicas of explosives are not allowed in checked or carry-on bags,” said a statement attributed to James Spies, the TSA’s federal security director for Idaho. “Our … officers take no risks when they screen a bag and see … [what] could be an explosive.\n\n“We’re grateful that, in this case, the items were not intended to harm anyone.”\n\nThe TSA list’s runner-up entry referred to a total of three turtles seized about four months apart in separate cases at the Newark Liberty and Miami international airports.\n\nIn Miami, in July, TSA officials caught a woman trying to sneak past an airport checkpoint with two turtles stuffed in her bra, as USA Today reported.\n\nOne of those two turtles subsequently died. The other was confiscated and given to Florida’s fish and wildlife department.\n\nThat episode called to mind one reported at the Newark airport in March, when TSA officers caught a man trying to sneak a turtle wrapped in a blue towel in the crotch area of his pants past a security checkpoint. Officers in that case confiscated the turtle, and the man reportedly missed his flight after being escorted out of the security checkpoint by law enforcement.\n\n“Friends, please – and we cannot emphasize this enough – stop hiding animals in weird places on your body and then trying to sneak them through airport security,” the TSA said in a social media post in July. The agency said people can legally travel with small animals, but they should check with airlines for their rules “concerning pets on board flights”.\n\n“Small pets are allowed through [agency checkpoints] but must be removed from any carriers and carried through,” TSA’s post said. “Notice we said ‘carried’ and not ‘hidden underneath your clothing.’”\n\nOther entries on the TSA’s list included bullets in Nesquik in Miami, drugs in shoes in Hawaii and pills in a shampoo bottle in Anchorage, Alaska.\n\nThe TSA said travelers can ask whether specific items are allowed through checkpoints using the agency’s “What Can I Bring” tool. It is available on TSA.gov and on the MyTSA app.\n\nAlternate methods are texting “Travel” to 275872 (AskTSA) or messaging the agency’s social media accounts: @AskTSA on X and Facebook.",

    "description": "The president raised a fuss about his ballroom project as a federal judge considers an injunction.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Sunday railed against legal efforts to stop the construction of a massive ballroom on the grounds of the White House.\n\n“There is no practical or reasonable way to go back,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “IT IS TOO LATE!”\n\nThe National Trust for Historic Preservation last month sued to block the construction of the ballroom after Trump last year demolished the East Wing with little notice to make room for the new building, which will dwarf the main residence.\n\n“The so-called ‘preservationists,’ who get their money from the most unusual of places, should not be allowed to stop this desperately needed addition to our GREAT White House, a place that a President has never needed permission to change or enhance, because of the special grounds on which it sits, no matter how big (and important!), that enhancement may be.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Leon last week questioned the administration’s legal authority on the project and seemed skeptical as he considers a potential injunction. The judge said he would decide next month.\n\nTrump has said the up to $400 million cost of the ballroom will be funded by private donations, raising ethical and other questions that the White House has yet to answer.\n\nBut on Sunday, he defended the planned facility as “a great, big, beautiful gift to the United States of America” and complained that the East Wing had been “bastardized” by previous renovations.\n\nTrump also said that the lawsuit has caused “top secret” information about the project to emerge.\n\nPolitics: U.S. Senator Comes Out And Says It About Trump: 'Invoke The 25th Amendment'\n\n“Additionally, in this instance, it is being done with the design, consent, and approval of the highest levels of the United States Military and Secret Service. The mere bringing of this ridiculous lawsuit has already, unfortunately, exposed this heretofore Top Secret fact. Stoppage of construction, at this late date, when so much has already been ordered and done, would be devastating to the White House, our Country, and all concerned.”\n\nWhile he did not get more specific, the East Wing was known to house the Presidential Emergency Operations Center ― aka the “underground bunker,” which Trump reportedly used during protests in 2020 ― and the new project is likely to replace and/or upgrade the facility.\n\nTrump has been obsessed with the project, which he frequently brings up unprompted. Earlier this month, he even interrupted a White House meeting with oil industry executives to get up, wander over to a window, and stare at the construction site.\n\nTrump on Sunday fired off messages on Truth Social about a number of topics including complaints about the NFL, Canada and journalist Don Lemon. He also wrote some messages about the ongoing unrest in Minneapolis, which has only grown more tense after federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti.\n\nPolitics: National Trust Warns Trump's Ballroom Will 'Overwhelm' White House\n\nBut it was his message about the ballroom that he pinned to the top of his feed.\n\nThe Architect Doing Trump's Ballroom Also Thinks It's Way Too Big: Report\n\n'I Can't Watch': Trump Fires Off Unexpected Whine At The Worst Possible Time\n\nHere's Who Has Been Surprisingly Willing To Defy Trump In His Second Term",

    "fullText": "“Simple... hard discipline”: Cardi B praises disciplined Stefon Diggs in Patriots win originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots defeated the Denver Broncos 10-7 to claim the AFC Championship amid freezing temperatures.\n\nWide receiver Stefon Diggs advanced to his first Super Bowl following the gritty victory, prompting an emotional celebration from his girlfriend, Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B, in the owner's suite. The haymaker came on kicker Andy Borregales’ 23-yard field goal in the third quarter, a 23-yard dart through the falling snow that provided the ultimate margin of victory. While the snowfall in Denver created a difficult environment for the players and the fans in attendance, the Patriots secured their 12th Super Bowl appearance in franchise history.\n\nOverall, the Patriots offense relied on a punishing 16-play drive – consuming nine minutes and 53 seconds of the clock – effectively grounding a Broncos attack that struggled to find rhythm in the adverse conditions. Diggs recorded five receptions for 17 yards during the low-scoring affair. Quarterback Drake Maye served as the statistical engine of the team during the game in Denver. Maye finished with 65 rushing yards and scored the only touchdown for the Patriots, navigating the snow with precision.\n\nStefon Diggs mutually parted ways with the Houston Texans after a one-year stint in 2025. However, it appears that his decision to sign a three-year contract with New England in March has paid dividends. The victory represents the first Super Bowl trip for Diggs in his career, vindication after he previously lost conference championship games while playing for the Minnesota Vikings and the Buffalo Bills.\n\nMORE: 3 reasons Patriots defense dominated in AFC playoffs — and can keep it up in Super Bowl 60\n\nCardi B was one of the thousands of Patriots fans who were tuned in for what became Diggs' first conference championship victory after multiple attempts. Apart from being a featured presence on the official Patriots Instagram account, the Grammy-winner’s appearance in the owner's suite marked another high-profile show of support now that the team has officially advanced. Over the past several months, the rapper has stood by Diggs' side as the veteran receiver navigated through a difficult recovery period following an ACL injury.\n\nShe shared her feelings with NFL Network reporter Cameron Wolfe after the win. The rapper described the pride she felt watching the receiver return from his injury, saying:\n\n\"I'm feeling very excited, I'm very happy for him, very proud of him,” Cardi B said. “He just came back from an ACL, and me seeing the progress and the process of him going through there, from the first time he started running back.\"\n\nCardi B life as a football girlie going well @iamcardib\n\nOur 1-on-1 chat as Stefon Diggs “hard work and discipline” journey leads him to Super Bowl. pic.twitter.com/vJnpEFl2rA\n\n— Cameron Wolfe (@CameronWolfe) January 26, 2026\n\nCardi B attributed the success of Diggs to his personal discipline and work ethic. There is no more disciplined athlete, maybe in the current locker room of the Patriots, than Stefon Diggs. She said:\n\n\"Discipline. Discipline and work. It's not like, oh, you wake up and you great. It's... it's discipline. It's going to bed early. It's go... waking up early. It's... it's not missing one day of work, nothing. It's discipline. Simple... hard discipline.\"\n\nThe rapper confirmed her relationship with Diggs in June and gave birth to their son in November, since becoming a regular at games. Wolfe mentioned that Diggs helped Cardi B transition into being a fan of the sport, referring to the rapper as a member of the \"brigade\" of Patriots supporters. She wore a Patriots cap and had green hair while attending the game in Denver. She said:\n\n\"Not at all. I mean, I'm a... I'm a big baseball fan. I'm a Red Sox fan. Everybody knows I'm a Red Sox fan. So... it's kind of cool that we keeping it... in New England.\"\n\nNew England will face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl 60 on Jan. 25. The Seahawks advanced after winning the NFC Championship game on the same day. Diggs was emotional after the victory and noted the team had more work to finish.\n\nMore New England Patriots News:\n\nSuper Bowl 2026 odds: Seahawks vs. Patriots best bets on opening lines\n\nMalcolm Butler's Super Bowl INT flashbacks begin ahead of Patriots-Seahawks rematch\n\nTeams, odds, spread and more for 2026 Super Bowl matchup",

    "fullText": "Why NFL fans believe 'script writers' predicted Super Bowl 60 matchup with preseason graphic originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFor a few years, there existed a conspiracy theory that the colors of the Super Bowl logo predicted which two teams would play for the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nWell, that one is out, and a new theory is in.\n\nSome NFL fans believe a preseason graphic the league posted to its social media accounts actually predicted the seemingly unpredictable Super Bowl 60 matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, two teams that hadn't won a playoff game since 2019 before this season.\n\nHere's a look at the graphic behind the NFL's newest \"script writer\" conspiracy theory.\n\nMORE:Super Bowl 60 odds, spread as Seahawks open as favorites\n\nAfter the Patriots and Seahawks punched their ticket to the Super Bowl, fans started to notice which two quarterbacks seem to be closer to the giant Lombardi Trophy than the rest in this graphic posted by the NFL on the first day of the regular season:\n\n— RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) January 26, 2026\n\nA closer inspection reveals you can make the case Baker Mayfield was actually closer than Darnold, or that Travis Hunter seems to be the closest to the trophy.\n\nThis is no time for facts, though. NFL fans have unearthed the latest grand Super Bowl conspiracy, and it's true that Maye and Darnold were both front and center in relation to the Lombardi Trophy in the graphic just as they are in reality today.\n\n\"They really gave us the script in September,\" the lead Drake Maye fan account tweeted Sunday night.\n\nThey really gave us the script in September https://t.co/ofeVgBdbPb\n\n— Drake Maye Lover (@drakemayeloverr) January 26, 2026\n\nAnother look at the graphic reveals the NFL probably believed a Patriots-Seahawks Super Bowl was enormously unlikely. The sport's biggest names are front-and-center, from Saquon Barkley and Patrick Mahomes to Brock Purdy and Joe Burrow. Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen are also closer to Mahomes and Barkley than they are to Maye and Darnold in the distance.\n\nConsidering players from the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Giants and Tennessee Titans are standing nearly shoulder-to-shoulder with Maye and Darnold in the distance, it seems more like the league discounted the Patriots and Seahawks than predicted their Super Bowl 60 meeting.\n\nWhy let the finer details get in the way of a good conspiracy theory, though?\n\nSeahawks take down Rams to advance to Super Bowl 60\n\nSam Darnold, Jaxon Smith-Njigba star for Seahawks in NFC championship\n\nRams' special teams blunders continue in NFC championship\n\nSeahawks Pope trend continues with Super Bowl 60 berth",

    "fullText": "The boos lurch up from the Lower Gladys end. Guttural, albeit technically premature, 45 seconds-ish too quick for the final whistle.\n\nNot that you can blame the Everton faithful for wanting to call it quits on this drab 1-0 Women’s Super League defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, Everton’s ninth loss of the season and their sixth at home. Sometimes that familiar chemical instinct just takes over, the brain telling the body to commit and just make it stop.\n\nThere’s something to be said for keeping heritage alive, that even the ‘Goodison Boo’ won’t be condemned to sepia-tint without a fight. We can still get angry here, fellas. There’s another thing to be said altogether about those boos returning so soon after the early-season promise of new hope and new chapters.\n\nAs of Sunday night, following victories for Liverpool and West Ham over Tottenham Hotspur and Leicester City, Brian Sorensen’s side sit third-from-bottom in the WSL, one point above bottom Liverpool, level on points with West Ham United and a point off Leicester above them.\n\nMaybe The Athletic is overreacting. But it feels many have forgotten there is a threat of relegation this season, that, with the WSL’s expansion from 12 to 14 teams and the promotion play-off between the bottom-placed WSL side and third-placed WSL2 side. For whatever reason, the spectre of the latter has been met in press boxes and boardrooms with a shrug, another shrug, some WSL-WSL2 equivalent of, “Lads, it’s Tottenham”.\n\nYet, it was clear on Friday night from those in the Goodison stands that they weren’t underplaying the risk, nor those Liverpool fans at St Helens on Sunday, twirling their red-and-white striped scarves over their heads at having finally tasted the sweet lacquer of league victory this season following their 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nAnd it was these scenes, so disparate in their respective anguish and relief, that should serve as a reminder to those running these clubs that the threat of relegation is very real.\n\nThe gap between the top of WSL2 and the bottom of WSL has, in recent history, been more precarious than conquerable, the financial buy-in required to compete not worth the pay-off for most ownerships. Yet, this January, WSL2 teams at the top are bolstering their ranks, fuelled by the knowledge that if there is a time to get in on this women’s football deal, now is it. Two WSL2 win an automatic pass to the top. The third wins a one-off showdown on home turf with the bottom-placed WSL side.\n\nThe latter is a prospect that has emboldened rather than deterred. Former top-flight sides Bristol City and Crystal Palace, seven and eight points behind leaders Charlton Athletic, have both been busy securing players with WSL experience.\n\nBirmingham City, five points behind Charlton, spent a reported second-tier record £270,000 ($370,000) to sign midfielder Wilma Leidhammar from Norrkoping.\n\nThree and a half years ago, such a fee would have been a world record.\n\nNow, it’s a benchmark for second-tier ambition.\n\nIt is also a timely warning to WSL teams who forget that the top-flight is a privilege, not a right.\n\nLiverpool have, for their part, heeded this, spending more than £1million in the January transfer window on an encouraging array of future promise and present impact. Three of those players – goalkeeper Jennifer Falk, midfielder Denise O’Sullivan (brought in for a club-record fee of £300,000 from North Carolina Courage) and Aurelie Csillag – were instrumental in Sunday’s victory.\n\nA big January had always been the plan, taking a half-season to adjust to a new playing style under new management, to give new recruitment head Rob Clarkson, who joined in the summer, time to gauge where the additional stitching was required before committing to any wholesale changes.\n\nYet, before kick-off on Sunday at St Helen’s, there still skulked a jittery energy in the press room and in the terraces, an understanding that the prevailing winds needed changing and fast. While the gap in quality between the WSL and WSL2 is still notable, momentum and morale can play a part.\n\nThe same realisation slowly permeated around Goodison at full time on Friday night. The Everton hierarchy’s vision for this season did not include injuries to key players such as captain Megan Finnigan and forward Katja Snoeijs, the departure of CEO Hannah Forshaw after less than a year in the role, or the ongoing transfer row with France striker Kelly Gago, whom Everton made their highest-paid player in the summer.\n\nBut there is a recognition internally that performances under Sorensen, often laborious with players unable to execute tactical nuances, have not been good enough. There is also recognition that Everton remain a work in progress and that the persistent calls to the new ownership for more investment in the squad – whose budget is the second-lowest in the WSL for the third successive season, according to sources – can’t keep being ignored.\n\nAnd perhaps that is what is needed: the sharpening of vision, the cold-blooded rush of survival mode.\n\nBefore the season began, there was an acknowledgement among senior figures at numerous WSL clubs that the watermark for existence had risen, that getting by would require more pocket-digging. Six months later, there is a growing understanding that those earlier projections were actually lowballed, that valuations and fees are rising more quickly than had been imagined.\n\nEven without the threat of relegation, Everton fans’ discontent is understandable. According to Opta, only at Arsenal’s Meadow Park (no wins) and Manchester City’s Joie Stadium (no wins) do Everton have a worse win rate than at Goodison Park (10 per cent).\n\nIf a WSL team finds itself on the sorry end of the promotion play-off, it will boil down to a failure to take the tide seriously, to sitting slack-jawed in the directors box as the walls cave in and those clubs around you nab yet another player off your wishlist.\n\nBecause that is where the stench of relegation begins to waft, eventually latching onto a depleted bench and another lacklustre backwards pass.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nLiverpool, Everton, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "description": "There are a slew of San Francisco 49ers free agents eligible for a franchise tag, but only one player makes sense to use it on.",
    "fullText": "It's rare that the San Francisco 49ers use their franchise tag during an offseason. We may see that rare occurrence in 2026.\n\nThere are 21 players eligible for franchise tags among the 49ers' 2026 free agents. Among those 21, only kicker Eddy Pineiro stands out as a real candidate for the tag.\n\nGeneral manager John Lynch and head coach Kyle Shanahan have typically been conservative about using the team's franchise tag on pending free agents, opting instead to either sign them to long-term deals or trade them for draft capital.\n\nThe only time they've used a franchise tag since taking over as the GM and head coach in 2017 was in 2019 when kicker Robbie Gould was set to hit free agency. Gould held out for a long-term deal and ultimately agreed to a four-year, $19 million deal with $10.5 million guaranteed instead of playing on the one-year, $5 million tag.\n\nWe may see something similar this offseason, although it's unclear whether Pineiro would hold out the same way Gould did.\n\nAfter joining the 49ers in Week 2, Pineiro went 28-for-29 on field goal tries in the regular season with his only miss coming on a 64-yard try that hit the crossbar. He was also a perfect three-for-three in the postseason. Given the 49ers' kicking woes it would make sense that they'll aim to keep Pineiro in the building.\n\nThe only other player who might receive a franchise tag is wide receiver Jauan Jennings, but Over the Cap projects the tag for a wide receiver to clear $28 million for one year. San Francisco may desire a reunion with Jennings. They're likely ready to pass at that exorbitant price tag.\n\nThat opens the door for the 49ers to use their tag on Pineiro to ensure some stability at the kicker position for at least one year with the chance of making him their kicker for the foreseeable future.\n\nMore 49ers: Grading the 49ers' 2025 rookie class after elimination\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: 49ers free agents: K Eddy Pineiro a franchise tag candidate",

    "fullText": "Purdue played an overall great game against the Illini but it was to no avail as Keaton Wagler had one of the greatest performances in Mackey Arena history on the way to an 88-82 victory for Illinois. It was an unfortunate loss for a team that has struggled to maintain leads in the last several games that have led to lots of questions from fans and pundits alike about Purdue’s ability to win the B1G and make a run in March. Can the Boilers get back on track? They’ll have a big opportunity to do so Tuesday night against Indiana inside Assembly Hall.\n\nLet’s take a look at the loss to the Illini ‘By the Numbers.’\n\nIt was an historic day for Illinois’ star freshman. Keaton Wagler entered the game against Purdue as the Illini’s leading scorer at 15.3ppg and tabbed as a possible lottery draft pick in the 2026 NBA Draft. Wagler elevated himself into rarified air with an amazing 46 point performance that showed the 6’6 guard may just be moving towards B1G player of the year and first team All-American.\n\nKeaton Wagler scored the most points EVER by a visitor at Mackey 😱:\n\n46 PTS\n13-17 FG\n9-11 3PT\n\nWOW. pic.twitter.com/KVAd0B0W0A\n\n— NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) January 24, 2026\n\nMackey Arena is typically a place where the best players can often struggle to get going. Steph Curry visited and found it difficult to do much of anything with Chris Kramer and the Paint Crew hounding him all game long. What kind of history did Wagler make? He now owns the highest single game scoring record for any opponent inside Mackey Arena and the third highest in any venue in Purdue’s entire program history.\n\nSimply put: This is what other teams felt like when Carsen Edwards would show up and hit everything once he crossed halfcourt.\n\nWagler’s performance was an all-time great one but Braden Smith had himself a day as well. The senior guard started off a little slow but when the Boilers needed someone to match Wagler’s scoring, he showed why he is likely to be a first team All American and win the Bob Cousy Award again. Smith would go for 27 points and 12 assists on just 1 turnover while playing 37 minutes and those three minutes were largely because he sprained his ankle in the second half.\n\nBraden Smith today:\n27 points\n3 rebounds\n12 assists\n1 steal\n69% FG\n2/3 3PM\n\n#4 Purdue lost to #11 Illinois by 6 pic.twitter.com/LhOii0TwI3\n\n— Daily Basketball Statlines (@DailyNBAStats) January 25, 2026\n\nSmith has continued to be stellar but simply isn’t getting the help he needs from teammates, specifically his fellow seniors in TKR and Loyer. Purdue still has the ability to attain their goals but it won’t happen with those two not playing up to what they should be as seniors.\n\nOmer Mayer came to Purdue as a player who was known to have a bit of scorers touch to his game that may be above his age. He flashed that for Israel at FIBA and seemingly in the preseason but the season started off rather rough from behind the arc. That hasn’t deterred Mayer up to this point as he has played really good defense and seemingly continued to contribute in almost any other way.\n\nIn the first 12 games, Mayer struggled from nearly everywhere on the floor. The freshman shot just 30/77 (39%) from the floor and 11/41 (26.8%) from behind the arc. He isn’t expected to be a primary scorer but being someone who can clearly generate his own shot and showing an ability to catch and shoot lifts Purdue’s offense. In the last eight games though, Mayer has turned it around.\n\nLost in that half: Omer Mayer being the best overseas pro in a game full of them. Those two threes were really important for #Purdue.\n\n— Brian Neubert — GoldandBlack.com (@brianneubert) January 24, 2026\n\nMayer has seemingly found his form, shooting 10/19 from behind the arc for 52.6% while averaging 1.1 turnovers. That’s a big key for a player who will definitely shoulder a bigger scoring load next season. That need was seen somewhat after Smith went to the bench with an ankle sprain and Mayer responded with 5 points, 1 rebound, and 1 assist in short span where he was needed more. He is actually scoring less but is much more efficient.\n\nIt isn’t often that Purdue over the last 40 years is utterly dominated on the glass like it was against the Illini. A 14 rebound advantage of 33-19 is one thing but giving up 13 offensive rebounds that led to an 18-2 advantage in second chance points was devastating. Purdue had less turnovers, converted those into points (more on that later), and shot 57% from the field. Allowing the Illini to break their spirit on the glass was the one things that it couldn’t afford to let happen with Wagler’s performance.\n\nThat minus fourteen rebounding mark is the worst performance for Purdue since they did the same against Illinois on January 21st, 2020.\n\nPurdue once again showed their ability in handling the ball in a high level manner by only turning the ball over for a program tying record (for a second time this season) of just three times. On the flipside, the Illini turned it over just ten times but Purdue converted those into 20 points. Purdue was +17 in that regard and it helped offset the rebounding and second chance scoring advantage the Illini had.\n\nNobody is going to question the impact that Fletcher Loyer can have on a basketball game. He is rarely in the wrong position on defense and always seems to be in the right place on offense. The issue over the last several games is that where he brings the most value on the offensive end as a dead-eye shooter and offensive mis-match just isn’t happening.\n\nPurdue needs more out of Fletcher Loyer. \n\nAveraging just 6.0 PPG in his last three games while shooting a combined 5-20 from the field and 2-12 from three-point range during that span. \n\nThe Boilers can't go back to the Final Four with Loyer playing like this.\n\n— Jon Rothstein (@JonRothstein) January 25, 2026\n\nOver the last nine games, Loyer is shooting just 14/54 for 25.9% from behind the arc. In fact, this is probably the most difficult stretch of shooting Loyer has endured in his career at Purdue. The frustrating thing is that Loyer is playing at a high level everywhere else for the Boilers but his ability to make threes is what gives him the most value. He isn’t good enough to be a scorer inside the arc alone and he isn’t good enough defensively to warrant that being his primary role either.\n\nFor Purdue to reach the goals it has for itself this season, it needs Loyer to figure out the shooting woes. In the struggles he has had in previous seasons, it was followed up with a long stretch of elite shooting, There is no reason that can’t happen again and it needs to happen if Purdue wants to win the B1G title.\n\nAgainst the Illini, Purdue was very secure with the ball. In fact, it was the 5th consecutive game that Purdue kept their turnovers in single digits. That is the type of ball security CMP has known this team is capable of having with the level of ball handlers it has in Smith, Loyer, Cox, Mayer, Harris, and Benter. In fact, this isn’t even the longest stretch of this level of security Purdue has had recently.\n\nLast season from the game against UCLA all the way to the first round matchup against High Point, Purdue went six straight games of turnovers in single digits. The Boilers did have a five game stretch in the 2018-2019 and 2011-2012 but their ability to limit turnovers appears to be the best of the CMP era this season.\n\nSince the start of the Keady-era, Purdue has rarely ever gotten through a season where it hasn’t suffered back to back losses. That has occurred in just 6 total seasons in that forty six year span and shows how difficult the grind of a B1G schedule truly can be. Those seasons were 2023-2024, 2016-2017, 1993-1994, 1989-1990, 1987-1988, and 1986-1987.\n\nOn the flipside of that, there have been some rough seasons that Purdue fans have had to endure as well. In the 2005-2006 season, the Boilers were just a bad basketball team that finished 9-19 and lost fifteen of their last eighteen games. Now, what about the worst losing streak for a Boiler squad that made the NCAA tourney? That would go to the 1990-1991 team that lost five straight games and made the tourney as a 7-seed but got beat in the first round by 10th seeded Temple.\n\nLosses happen in long seasons and losing back to back games is more common than you may realize. Even really good teams in Purdue history have lost back to back games but that isn’t necessarily cause for worry. The key will be how the Boilers continue to use what they learn through the season to find ways to improve and that’s something this group and this coaching staff have shown a high ability to do.\n\nWith his nine points scored, Oscar Cluff surpassed the 1,000 point mark with 1,007 points for his career that has spanned three seasons at Washington State, South Dakota State, and now Purdue. Cluff isn’t likely to break his single season scoring record of 528 and he isn’t likely to break any other personal records, but he has been exactly what the Boilers needed (not withstanding the apparent scheme issue that came to a head against UCLA and Illinois).\n\n1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣\n\n4th active Boilermaker to reach that mark. pic.twitter.com/XhX7wTASIT\n\n— Purdue Men's Basketball (@BoilerBall) January 24, 2026\n\nWith his twelve assists, Braden Smith now has 943 career assists.

    "description": "Matthew Stafford was brilliant. Sean McVay was a maestro. And yet, the Los Angeles Rams' season of labor evaporated in a cascade of margins in Seattle.",
    "fullText": "SEATTLE — What happens to a dream deferred?\n\nDoes it dry up like a raisin in the incessant, mocking Seattle cold?\n\nDoes it fester like a wound, salted by the sting of a single yard, a single catch, a single decision in the cruel calculus of a championship game?\n\nOr does it simply sag, a heavy weight on the shoulders of 53 men in blue and gold, as the opposing confetti falls like an alien, hateful snow?\n\nFor the Los Angeles Rams, the dream of a return to the summit, of completing a masterful two-year reconstruction, was deferred, denied, and finally extinguished in a 31-27 NFC Championship loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIt was a defeat scripted not by a lack of talent or heart, but by the finest of margins—the slivers of error that separate confetti from emptiness.\n\nMatthew Stafford was majestic; he was MVP-esque.\n\nHe carved the NFL's top-ranked scoring defense with the precision of a neurosurgeon, completing 22 of 35 passes for 374 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe threw darts into pinholes, launching seven completions for 226 yards on passes that traveled 20+ air yards—the most surrendered by Seattle in a decade.\n\n\"He's the MVP of the league,\" head coach Sean McVay said. \"This guy played at a level that's just different.\"\n\nMcVay himself called a luminous game, his play-action designs rendering Seattle's fierce pass rush a step slow, generating 208 yards from deception alone.\n\nFor long stretches, the Rams' offense was a symphony of synchronized beauty. Puka Nacua, who had nine receptions for 165 yards and a touchdown, was a force of nature.\n\nDavante Adams turned back the clock with four receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown.\n\nYet, the symphony ended flat, missing its final, crucial notes.\n\nFootball games, particularly championship games, are won in the margins.\n\nYou win by capitalizing on every opportunity to extend a lead, especially before halftime, not surrendering it.\n\nLeading 13-10 with 1:33 left in the second quarter, the Rams' offense went three-and-out, a puny, passive series that gifted Seattle 54 seconds.\n\nSam Darnold—the maligned, the itinerant, the USC quarterback whose marred legacy, built by ghastly, past collapses—marched the Seahawks 79 yards in six plays.\n\nA touchdown. A 17-13 deficit. A tide turned.\n\n\"We had our chances,\" McVay said. \"I thought we got a lot of what we wanted today.\"\n\nXavier Smith, reliable all year, let the slick ball slip through his grasp in the third quarter. One play later, Darnold found Jake Bobo for a 17-yard score.\n\nA potential stop became an 11-point hole.\n\n\"That was a tough one,\" McVay said. \"You feel like you're going to get some good momentum… and then they score on the very first play.\"\n\nThe margins are a fourth-down calculus.\n\nTrailing 31-27 with 4:52 left, the Rams faced 4th and 4 at the Seattle 6-yard line.\n\nA field goal makes it a one-point game; however, analytics screamed to go for it.\n\nMcVay, the modern evangelist of aggression, listened.\n\nDevon Witherspoon deflected Stafford's pass for Terrence Ferguson, and the Rams walked away with nothing.\n\nAnd so, the dream of an opportunity to hoist the Lombardi Trophy for the third time in nine years––is deferred.\n\nNow, the questions hang in the Los Angeles air, thick and urgent.\n\nWhere do the Rams go from here?\n\nHow do they bolster a secondary that proved porous over the season's latter half, a unit torched for 153 yards by Jaxon Smith-Njigba alone?\n\nHow do they reinforce a linebacking corps that, at times, was outmatched in coverage and containment?\n\nThe labor to craft this contender was Herculean. There is no assurance of a return.\n\nThe NFC landscape offers no solace.\n\nSeattle, with Mike Macdonald's defensive genius, has the makings of a sustained beast.\n\nChicago's offense buds with terrifying potential.\n\nPhiladelphia simmers, a quarterback adjustment away.\n\nSan Francisco, if it can ever stanch its injury plague, remains a monster.\n\nAnd on the other side stood Sam Darnold.\n\nEveryone must now rewrite the narrative of his career—that he folds and crumples under pressure.\n\nDarnold completed 25 of 36 for 346 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHe stood resolute, becoming the first USC quarterback to start a Super Bowl.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" Darnold said. \"To be able to do it with these guys… that's why it means the world to me.\"\n\nIn the Rams' silent locker room, the dream lay not exploded, but deflated.\n\nStafford's brilliance, McVay's mastery—both rendered artifacts of a path not taken.\n\nLangston Hughes' poem asks what happens to a dream deferred.\n\nOn this night, the Rams live the answer: it doesn't explode. It just slowly, painfully, drains away, leaving only the hard questions of an endless offseason and the haunting vision of what might have been, one yard, one catch, one decision away.",

    "description": "\"It was one of the most bizarre, sad games I’ve ever been a part of.\"",
    "fullText": "The mood inside the Target Center was, understandably, off on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhile the Golden State Warriors did roll to a near-30-point blowout over the Minnesota Timberwolves, it wasn’t the game that threw the vibes off. It was everything else going on just outside of the arena doors on the streets of Minneapolis that did it.\n\nThat, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said after the Warriors' 111-85 win, was very apparent.\n\n“Honestly what I felt was that their group was suffering,” Kerr said, via ESPN’s Anthony Slater. “I thought the vibe in the stands, it was one of the most bizarre, sad games I’ve ever been a part of. You could feel the somber atmosphere. Their team, we could tell, they were struggling with everything that’s been going on and what the city has been through.\n\n“It was very sad. It was a sad night.”\n\nSteve Kerr called the arena atmosphere in Minneapolis today one of the most “bizarre, sad” vibes he’s experienced at a game\n\nWarriors blew out the Timberwolves. \n\n“Honestly what I felt was that their group was suffering.” pic.twitter.com/K1EsR6Fr8j\n\n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) January 26, 2026\n\nSunday’s game was initially supposed to be held on Saturday, but the league quickly pushed it 24 hours in the wake of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Veterans Affairs nurse Alex Pretti by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. That came just weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good elsewhere in the city. Those shootings, as well as larger ICE operations and activity throughout the Twin Cities region, have sparked massive protests and demonstrations.\n\nPlenty in the sports world have spoken out, including several Minnesota sports teams and the National Basketball Players Association. New York Liberty star and Unrivaled co-founder Breanna Stewart held an “Abolish ICE” sign before her game on Sunday. Former Timberwolves star Karl-Anthony Towns and Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton both posted about it on social media.\n\nAfter seeing the situation unfold, both Kerr and Timberwolves coach Chris Finch were in agreement. Playing basketball on Saturday, Finch said, “just didn’t feel like the right thing to do.”\n\nHere is Chris Finch's opening statement prior to his pregame media availability on the shooting in Minneapolis on Saturday.\n\n\"For the second time in less than three weeks, we've lost another member of our community in the most unimaginable way.\" pic.twitter.com/mWRhBchC3W\n\n— Dane Moore (@DaneMooreNBA) January 25, 2026\n\n“For the second time in less than three weeks, we’ve lost another beloved member of our community in the most unimaginable way,” an emotional Finch said before the game.\n\n“As an organization, we are heartbroken for what we are having to witness and endure and watch. We just want to extend our thoughts, prayers and concern for Mr. Pretti’s family, all the loved ones and everyone involved in such an unconscionable situation in a community that we really love, full of people who are, by nature, peaceful and prideful. We just stand in support of our great community here.”\n\nWarriors star Stephen Curry said he was “glued” to the TV on Friday and Saturday when they weren’t playing or practicing. He also said he has videos on his phone that he took of protesters who were walking through the streets on Friday outside of their hotel in sub-zero temperatures.\n\n“The protests that were going on downtown, it was amazing to watch the turnout,” Curry said. “The peaceful protests and unified voice that was here, you feel like that would kind of turn the tide to a more positive direction. Then you wake up in the morning and you see what happened … There's a lot of change that needs to happen, and when you’re here, you feel it.”\n\nThe Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti before the game on Sunday. Several in the crowd shouted out “F*** ICE” during the moment.\n\nMoment of silence held for Alex Pretti before today’s game. pic.twitter.com/qzbAVlFxVh\n\n— Chris Hine (@ChristopherHine) January 25, 2026\n\nWhile there were protests outside of the Target Center again on Sunday, the game went off as planned without any issues.\n\n“It’s very difficult to see so many people struggling and sad,” Kerr said. “They came to the game to try to forget about stuff, I guess, but I don’t think anything went away for the city and for their team. I think they were suffering from the effects of everything.”",

    "fullText": "Jessica Pegula sent reigning champion and podcast co-host Madison Keys spinning out of the Australian Open on Monday while Jannik Sinner aims to avoid the same fate and reach the quarter-finals in stifling heat.\n\nIn temperatures approaching 30C in Melbourne, fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti set up a last-eight showdown with Novak Djokovic.\n\nKeys and Pegula launched day nine in a clash at Rod Laver Arena between two Americans who know each other well.\n\nThey are good friends and also host a tennis podcast together, \"The Player's Box\", and had even been planning to record an episode on the eve of their match.\n\nAll that was put aside as a clinical Pegula dominated 6-3, 6-4 to set up a last-eight encounter with another American in fourth seed Amanda Anisimova.\n\nAnisimova, beaten finalist at last year's US Open and Wimbledon, cooled herself off with bags of ice before taming China's Wang Xinyu 7-6 (7/4), 6-4.\n\nPegula, the 31-year-old sixth seed, is chasing an elusive Grand Slam title, her best performance to date reaching the US Open final in 2024.\n\nAn erratic Keys made 27 unforced errors to Pegula's 17 and fired down six double faults as her title defence ended in the last 16.\n\nThe forfeit, as a part of a jokey bet with Pegula, will be a slice of apple pie with melted cheddar cheese on top.\n\n\"A bet is a bet, so I'll do it. I hope it's less gross than I think it's going to be, but we will find out,\" said Keys, who described herself as proud despite defeat.\n\nAlso in the women's draw in the fourth round, fifth seed Elena Rybakina plays 21st seed Elise Mertens of Belgium.\n\nSecond seed Iga Swiatek will be heavy favourite against Maddison Inglis.\n\nAustralian qualifier Inglis, ranked 168, features on Rod Laver Arena in the biggest match of her life.\n\nThe 28-year-old was given free passage into the last 16 when two-time Melbourne champion Naomi Osaka pulled out injured.\n\nAfter sizzling weather caused the suspension of matches on Saturday, temperatures are rising sharply again.\n\nLonger matches on Monday will have 10-minute breaks in certain circumstances as part of measures to protect player health.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to hit a blistering 44C on Tuesday, meaning matches are likely to be played under roofs on the three courts that have them.\n\nLater Monday, reigning champion Sinner — who struggles in the heat — will be strong favourite against fellow Italian Luciano Darderi.\n\nDarderi, the 22nd seed, has never made it this far at a Grand Slam while Sinner is chasing a third Australian Open crown in a row.\n\nOnly Djokovic has done that in the Open era.\n\nMelbourne Park king Djokovic was supposed to play the 20-year-old Jakub Mensik in a night match.\n\nBut the Czech player pulled out injured on Sunday, sending 10-time champion Djokovic into the last eight without hitting a ball.\n\nThe 38-year-old Serb will play Musetti after the Italian defeated American ninth seed Taylor Fritz 6-2, 7-5, 6-4.\n\nIn the last match of the day on centre court, United States eighth seed Ben Shelton plays Norway's 12th seed Casper Ruud in the timeslot when Djokovic was supposed to be on court.",

    "fullText": "While Minnesota is supercharged with emotions, Stephen Curry demonstrated physical grit of his own. Before he lent heartfelt support to the grieving community that’s rattled by the death of Alex Pretti on Saturday (the day the game was originally scheduled for), Curry led the Warriors to a 111-85 win. All while powering through injuries, getting hurt again, and adding another historic knotch to his resume.\n\nCurry revealed he was following the goings-on in Minnesota while he spent Saturday resting his knee after the game was cancelled. He was listed as questionable before Sunday’s rescheduled game. But he played 28 minutes and was instrumental in the Dubs’ turnaround. Another player stepped on his toe, but that didn’t seem to slow him down.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the Dubs and Wolves have a back-to-back rematch tomorrow. When asked if he would be available tomorrow, Curry said, “If everything goes well, yeah. With the recovery and all that, the minutes tonight weren’t crazy, so hopefully I respond well.”\n\nWhen the Golden State Warriors landed in Minnesota yesterday, some of the players got their workouts in before the game was canceled. The point guard hurt his knee during that. “Kind of something flared up yesterday when we came over to get a workout in. It was super weird,” he revealed.\n\nBut his personal injury update is a lot more concerning when he reveals some persistent issues. “I’ve had stuff going on with quads and whatnot, but it was something that I hadn’t felt before. So, I definitely took advantage of the day off to get right, but hopefully that continues.”\n\nAfter Jimmy Butler’s season-ending ACL tear, followed by Jonathan Kuminga’s indefinite break for bone bruising, the last thing Dub Nation can deal with is an injured Steph. Tomorrow De’Anthony Melton and Al Horford sit out for injury management and fans wouldn’t mind if Steph joined them. Moving up the all-time scoring ladder can wait a little longer.\n\nDespite battling injuries, Stephen Curry had an impressive 26 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists, and 4 steals. That alone carried him to the 19th spot on the NBA’s All-time Scoring list. He passed John Havlicek and tied Paul Pierce for cracking the top 20 with 26,397 points in his career.\n\nHe’s only 99 points away from catching up to Tim Duncan next. So far this season, Curry has averaged 27.3 points, 5.0 assists, and 3.7 rebounds while shooting 46.8% from the field and 39.8% from the arc.\n\nAnalysts predict he’d crack top 10 soon enough. They, in fact, think he would’ve done it a long time ago had it not been for his injury history that also kept him underpaid for a period of time.\n\nTonight, Curry limped during the empty moments and yet he carried the offense. If he aggravates what is now a sore knee and ends up missing more than one game, the Warriors’ offense will be diminished.\n\nFor now even Steve Kerr is hopeful that Curry will be cleared to play. Steph is still listed as questionable for Monday and they’ve left his status as a game-time decision.\n\nThe post Stephen Curry Shares Worrying Injury Update After Historic NBA Achievement Against Timberwolves appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "UFC 324 did more than just try to reshuffle the flyweight rankings; it also revived old grudges and established new ones overnight. One knockout in the prelims sent shockwaves across the division, and the fallout quickly spread on social media. What should have been a quiet night for the champion Joshua Van, watching the fight at home, evolved into a digital sparring match, revealing exactly how heated the title picture has become.\n\nFor ‘The Fearless,’ the timing was almost too perfect. As fans processed Charles Johnson‘s defeat at UFC 324, the champion casually shared a tweet that cut harder than it looked. With a laughing emoji and a simple caption, a long-awaited rematch wasn’t just delayed—it felt erased.\n\nJoshua Van’s tweet wasn’t subtle. “Uhh ohh, there goes the rematch\n\n,” he wrote, a direct dig at Charles Johnson—the only man to knock him out in the UFC. Given their history, it felt like a reminder: momentum is vital, and timing can be cruel. Johnson had spent months suggesting that he still found flaws in Van’s game.\n\nBut UFC 324 effectively sealed that door that led to the rematch, at least for the time being. That’s when Manel Kape joined the chat. Clearly furious, ‘Staryboy’ denied any suggestion that Van was looking past him, arguing that the champion only got to this point because he stepped in during Kape’s injury absence.\n\nIn a fiery tweet, he wrote, “Don’t forget this: you’re only in this position because I broke my foot and you replaced me against Brandon Royval. Everyone saw what happened once I came back from injury.” He further added, “So stop this rematch bulls—. He knocked u out cold; there is no rematch. You’re fighting me. Give me four weeks. That’s all I need to put u back in diapers.”\n\nVan’s response? He didn’t bite emotionally; he corrected the record. “Shut up u didn’t wanna sign the contract\n\n,” he replied dismissively. And honestly, his version checks out. As per reports, after UFC 324 lost its original co-headliner between women’s bantamweight champion Kayla Harrison and Amanda Nunes, Van got the call.\n\nAnd while the champion refused to confirm or deny it, he did hint that Kape turned down a fight against him at some point. He told MMA Junkie. “Ask him. He would know. Last time I checked, the champ said yes, and the challenger said no.” The 24-year-old further added, “One guy is running.”\n\nWhile UFC 324 did not crown his next opponent, it did clarify one thing: ‘The Fearless’ is not seeking validation. He’s watching the division sort itself out and waiting for someone to volunteer. And if Manel Kape is to be believed, he is ready for the fight and has a lot planned for the title fight already.\n\nThat confidence Joshua Van has been projecting is exactly what Manel Kape seems to be feeding off. Unlike ‘The Fearless,’ who has chosen to be more measured, Kape has taken the opposite approach by being loud, dismissive, and certain that this matchup will end one way. In his opinion, this is not a debate about contenders or timing. It’s a stylistic mismatch waiting to be exposed.\n\n‘Starboy’ did not mince words when talking about Joshua Van to MMA Junkie. He pitched the potential title bout as routine business rather than a challenge, relying primarily on the idea that Van’s striking plays into his hands. Kape believes his current run of knockouts has already revealed the disparity, claiming that even high-volume competitors were unable to touch him once he found his groove.\n\nTo him, Van represents movement without consequence. “To be honest, I see Joshua Van as a punching bag. For my fight, I think I only have to go to the gym and punch the bag. That’s the fight that I’m going to have. A hard punching bag. What I’m going to land whatever I want. Of course, this punching bag is going to throw something, but I’m going to avoid.”\n\nWhat makes Manel Kape’s pitch interesting isn’t the trash talk, but the conviction behind it. He’s promising control wrapped in violence, a mano-o-mano that looks exciting but is ultimately one-sided. In fact, even the date or location doesn’t seem to matter much to him either. He says all the promotion has to do is pick the date and send the contract.\n\n“Let’s go March 8 [at UFC 326],” Kape suggested. “That’s the date. But I don’t mind to fight in Houston. I don’t mind to be a title [fight] co-main event. I know this doesn’t happen, but I don’t mind this.” The question of whether that confidence is prophetic or premature remains unanswered. But one thing is certain: if this fight takes place, Manel Kape’s side will be full of belief, and that alone ensures fans that the tension will keep on building.\n\nThe post Joshua Van Unfazed by Manel Kape’s Fiery Response After UFC 324 Result Costs Him a Major Rematch appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

New England has won six championships so far, all with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\n\nIf the Patriots get their seventh Super Bowl win in two weeks, it will be the most in NFL history, breaking a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Their 12 appearances are already a record.\n\nThe Steelers also have six Lombardi Trophies, with their most recent one coming during the 2008 campaign. Four of their rings came during the 1970s, however, so New England has been the far more successful franchise recently.\n\nPatriots \n\nLast 25 years \n\nHave more than 2X the amount of Super Bowl appearances as the next 2 teams COMBINED \n\n1.

The Patriots have reached four Super Bowls and won two during that time.\n\nWhile New England has NFL history at stake, so does its head coach, Mike Vrabel. A three-time Super Bowl champ with the Patriots as a player, he has a chance to become the first person in NFL history to win a Super Bowl as a player and a coach with the same franchise.\n\nTo do that, they’ll have to go through the Seattle Seahawks, who are out for revenge after narrowly losing their last Super Bowl appearance to New England on Malcolm Butler’s goal-line interception 11 years ago. The Seahawks will have to overcome that painful history along with Sam Darnold’s embarrassing 0-4 career record against the Patriots.\n\nDarnold will need to step up against New England’s historically good defense, which is averaging just 8.7 points per game allowed in these playoffs. Meanwhile, the Patriots have already beaten three elite defenses this postseason, so there’s no reason they can’t defeat another.\n\nSam Darnold’s Mind‑Boggling Stat Vs.

    "fullText": "Jessica Pegula avoided wearing a Kansas City Chiefs jersey as she defeated Madison Keys to end her fellow podcast host’s Australia Open title defence.\n\nPegula will play another American in fourth seed Amanda Anisimova in the quarter-finals after reaching the last-eight in Melbourne for the fourth time.\n\nThe 31-year-old sixth seed is good friends with Keys, who won her first grand slam title at the Australian Open last year, and they host The Player's Box podcast together along with Jennifer Brady and Desirae Krawczyk.\n\nThey recorded an episode before their fourth-round match, and decided the winner would choose a forfeit for the loser.\n\nKeys decided that if she won, Pegula, whose parents own the NFL team the Buffalo Bills, would have had to wear a Chiefs jersey with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift on the back.\n\nIn ensuring she avoided wearing the colours of the source of Buffalo’s recent post-season woes, Pegula will instead make Keys eat an apple pie topped with melted cheese.\n\n“I had a lot of motivation today,” Pegula said after her 6-3 6-4 victory over Keys, with the pair remaining in good spirits as they were seen chatting in the gym post-match as Pegula avoided the forfeit.\n\n“That was bad,\" said Pegula. \"She was, like, 'Mine's worse'. I was, like, 'What are you talking about? My family owns the Bills. This team has owned us in the post-season'.\n\n“All she has to do is eat a piece of pie. What is the big deal? I think that was really some extra motivation, because that would have been a tough moment for me.”\n\nPegula said the apple pie topped with cheddar cheese was her family's Thanksgiving tradition.\n\n\"A bet is a bet, so I'll do it,\" said Keys. \"I hope it's less gross than I think it's going to be, but we will find out, I guess.\"\n\nKeys, meanwhile, is set to drop out of the world’s top 10 after her fourth-round exit but said she was proud of how she had handle the experience of returning as defending champion.\n\n“It's obviously not the way that I wanted things to end here, but I'm still really proud of myself,” Keys said\n\n“I think coming back, being defending champion, dealing with all of the extra pressure and nerves, I'm just really proud of myself for how I handled it.\n\n“Just one of those days where I feel like Jess beat me, and I can kind of walk away with my head held high.”\n\nPegula is bidding to win her first grand slam title, having coming closest at the US Open with an appearance in the final and semi-finals in the last two seasons.\n\nBut she is yet to drop a set so far and will be confident when she meets another US Open runner-up in Anisimova, who is bidding to win her first grand slam title after defeats in the finals of Wimbledon and the US Open last season.\n\n“I'm just really happy that the work that I've done with my coaches,” Pegula said. “I really believe in that and what we have done, and to be able to kind of execute that stuff in a grand slam, second tournament of the year for me, will give me a lot of confidence, not just here but just going into the year.\n\n“I have always been the type of player where I get frustrated when I feel like I'm not getting better. And I still think that at my age, I've already had a lot of really great results. Being 31, I still feel like I'm improving as a player. So that is what gets me the most excited.”",

    "fullText": "Worldwide, heat waves are becoming less unusual. It's no longer possible to ignore sweltering summer temperatures or to dismiss them as one-off anomalies.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the Australian Open tennis tournament, scheduled for the second half of January amid peak summer weather in the Southern Hemisphere, has been forced to rearrange some of its matches and adjust court assignments in anticipation of 100-degree afternoon temperatures in Melbourne.\n\nThe tournament has shifted its morning start time earlier by an hour, making room for an additional match in Margaret Court Arena — one of only three available indoor courts.\n\nIt's not the first time the Australian Open has had to account for intolerable weather conditions. In 2019, per the Times, the tournament introduced a \"Heat Stress Scale\" to account for \"the four climate factors — air temperature, radiant heat or the strength of the sun, humidity, and wind speed — which affect a player's ability to disperse heat from their body.\"\n\nIn addition to being unbearable for athletes active at the time, these high summer temperatures are symptomatic of a climate that's changing for the worse.\n\nSouth Australia fire chief Brett Loughlin told the Guardian that the recent temperature extremes rank among \"some of the most significant fire weather forecasts we have seen in South Australia in recent years.\"\n\nWarm summers and isolated weather phenomena on their own may not be much cause for concern, but their mounting severity in recent decades points to a broader pattern. Human activity is the principal driving force behind our current climate crisis, with industrial and residential greenhouse gas trapping heat within our atmosphere as our natural carbon sinks — that is, oceans and forests — fall victim to pollution and urbanization.\n\nWhile Australia endures a torrid summer, much of the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing an abnormally warm, dry winter. Meanwhile, the occasional extreme cold snap — contrary to popular belief — is just another way in which the climate catastrophe can manifest, as Arctic melting temporarily shifts the bitterly cold polar vortex southward.\n\nThe Australian Open may be moving tennis schedules to accommodate this alarming heat, but our warming climate has begun affecting athletes and nonathletes around the world — and likely will for decades to come. New carbon capture technologies and efforts to preserve the longevity of our forests and oceans can go a long way, but in the end, it's collective action that can make a real difference.\n\nFor your part, try taking public transit instead of your private combustion vehicle to work every day. Consider upgrading your appliances to energy-efficient alternatives or even installing an eco-friendly solar energy system. Even though it may not seem like much, individual choices do add up for the better.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale.",
    "fullText": "Once the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Sam Darnold’s career seemed destined to be remembered as a cautionary tale. He was labeled a bust with the New York Jets, flamed out in Carolina, faded into the background in San Francisco, and was ultimately discarded by the Minnesota Vikings. Eight seasons later, that narrative is officially dead.\n\nOn Sunday night, Darnold delivered the defining performance of his career, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a 31–27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game. The victory sends Seattle to Super Bowl LX. And sends Darnold’s critics scrambling.\n\n“I mean, he just shut a lot of people up tonight,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said after the game. “So I’m really happy for him.”\n\nDarnold was sensational from start to finish, matching throws with MVP candidate Matthew Stafford on the game’s biggest stage. He connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a momentum-swinging touchdown with 20 seconds left in the first half, flipping the game in Seattle’s favor.\n\nFollowing a disastrous Rams special teams mistake, Darnold capitalized by firing a strike to Jake Bobo over the middle for another score. Later, he ripped a perfectly placed spiral through Los Angeles’ zone coverage to Cooper Kupp for a 13-yard touchdown, the play that ultimately proved decisive.\n\nThe performance was a masterclass in poise and precision. Darnold finished 25-of-36 passing with zero interceptions, repeatedly delivering when the moment demanded it most.\n\nSeattle complemented Darnold’s brilliance with timely defense and game-changing special teams. Devon Witherspoon made back-to-back pass breakups inside the six-yard line late in the fourth quarter, forcing a turnover on downs that kept the Rams off the scoreboard.\n\nOn special teams, the Seahawks forced two muffed punts from Rams returner Xavier Smith, recovering the second to set up Darnold’s touchdown pass to Bobo.\n\n“It’s a team win,” Macdonald said. “And then, you can’t talk about the game without talking about our quarterback.”\n\nFor Darnold, this marks his first NFC Championship win as a starter. He previously earned a conference title as a backup with the 49ers during their Super Bowl run two years ago, but this one was different — this one was his.\n\nAfter five teams, nearly 3,000 pass attempts, and almost eight full seasons in the league, Darnold has become the first quarterback from the vaunted 2018 draft class, which included Baker Mayfield and MVPs Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson, to win a conference championship as a starter.\n\nWhen his best was required, Sam Darnold delivered it. Two weeks from now in Santa Clara, he’ll have a chance to put the final stamp on a career resurrection that once seemed impossible.\n\nThe post Seahawks News: Mike Macdonald Says Sam Darnold “Shut a Lot of People Up” With 3-TD Game vs. Rams appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "\"I just love a challenge really, that's my problem.\"\n\nWelsh PE teacher Lauren Stockley draws a smile as she plots out another busy year.\n\nNot content with just heading to the Ironman 70.3 World Championships in Nice in September, she has her sights set on more Hyrox glory.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Hyrox is a global fitness racing competition designed to test an athlete's endurance and strength.\n\nIt has become hugely popular and last year thousands descended on Cardiff for a three-day event at the Principality Stadium.\n\nStockley, 26, has proved a natural talent. A little over a year after completing her first Hyrox, she was part of a quartet who set a women's world record in London in December 2025.\n\nHow Hyrox became the latest sporting craze\n\nHyrox: The new fitness trend sweeping the capital\n\nHyrox comprises of 8km of running with eight exercise stations in between.\n\nCompetitors endure 1km on a standing ski machine, 50m sled push, 50m sled pull, 80m burpee jumps, 1km indoor rowing, 200m kettlebell carry, 100m sandbag lunges, and to finish, 100 throws and catches of a medicine ball.\n\n\"I've always been involved in sport in my whole life really,\" Stockley said.\n\n\"I was a competitive swimmer and runner from a young age.\n\n\"When I went to university I enjoyed a lot of hockey but after that I got into a bit of CrossFit, so I've sort of done everything.\n\n\"With CrossFit I enjoyed the Olympic lifting but it compromised my running quite a bit and that's when I saw Hyrox as this big fitness event and thought I'd like to give that a go.\"\n\nStockley's Hyrox debut came at an open event in Birmingham with her performance earning her qualification for the World Championships in Chicago.\n\n\"I was like 'right I actually need to do a bit of training for this,'\" she said.\n\n\"I did first pro in Glasgow, the weights increased and I won that in my age group.\n\n\"I was fifth in my age group at World Champs in 2025 and it's been going in a nice trajectory ever since.\"\n\nIn her first year of professional Hyrox races, Stockley could have been forgiven for easing herself into the sport, but by the year's end she had set a world record alongside Alexandra Hill, Saskia Geddes and Allana Falconer.\n\n\"I'd met them before but we'd never actually raced together so we were sort of put together in this team,\" Stockley recalled.\n\n\"It was never an aim for us [to set a world record]. We were always going to give it a good go, it was the last race of London Hyrox, so it was like, 'right let's do this.'\n\n\"We looked up at the board and said 'oh my gosh I think this is a world record', it was a surprise but we went as hard as we could.\n\n\"Once we'd finished I think the realisation set in and the announcer realised 'oh my God this is a world record'\".\n\nStockley is now preparing for the Elite 15 competition in Phoenix, Arizona which serves as one of four Hyrox majors.\n\nThe State Farm Stadium, home to NFL's Arizona Cardinals, will serve as host for the event, with Stockley competing in the singles on 29 January before returning two days later for the age group doubles.\n\nThe top three finishers at each earn automatic qualification to June's World Championships in Sweden.\n\nStockley says competition will be fierce.\n\n\"To be with those top girls, they're running under that hour mark so that's definitely a goal,\" she said.",

    "fullText": "Kenneth Walker III, Jaxon Smith-Njigba lead list of Big Ten stars in Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Super Bowl between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots has a chance to be one of the best in recent memory. As such, it is a prime opportunity for some former Big Ten stars to show out on one of the biggest stages in sports.\n\nMore specifically, among the Seahawks, four former Big Ten players stand out, each with a uniquely different path to where they are today. Those would be Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, cornerback Devon Witherspoon and quarterback Sam Darnold.\n\nFor those who may have forgotten, Smith-Njigba was a one-man show at Ohio State with an electrifying offensive presence around him. In 2021, he had a breakout season for the Buckeyes with 1,606 receiving yards and nine touchdowns.\n\nMeanwhile, Walker III was as reliable as ever on Michigan State teams that were a far cry from what fans in the mid-2010s were used to. In his one season with Michigan State before heading off to the NFL, he scored 19 total touchdowns\n\nMORE: Jaxon Smith-Njigba joins elite club with absurd record in Seahawks-Rams NFC Championship\n\nNow he's duplicating his collegiate success in the NFLas he scored a touchdown in Sunday's NFC Championship en route to a 31-27 win against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nSignaling out the many accolades that make Darnold one of the NFL's best comeback stories in recent memory, the fact that he is the first-ever ex-USC Trojan set to start a Super Bowl is truly remarkable.\n\nConcerning Witherspoon, it just goes to show that Illinois coach Bret Bielema's model of \"sustained success\" and wearing the developmental program mantra with pride is what makes Witherspoon's success story as memorable as ever.\n\nIn fact, he may just be the unsung hero who put the Seahawks in a position to win to begin with.\n\nNonetheless, all four stars are just four of a select few that will have a chance to make their mark on NFL history for years to come.\n\nMORE: Why Fernando Mendoza would be 'so grateful' to be selected by 'any team' in NFL draft\n\nIn 12 days, we'll see how far they come.\n\nCurt Cignetti says what every college football fan can agree on fresh off Indiana's title\n\nBret Bielema rips AP voters after Illinois football was shelved over Big Ten team it beat\n\nCollege football analyst rips those in denial of Curt Cignetti's, Indiana's success\n\nCollege football pundit shares shocking Ohio State football ranking amid 2026 off-season",

    "fullText": "Barcelona will be busy in the final week of the winter transfer window, both in terms of signings and exits. Regarding the latter, the most notable will be Dro Fernandez, who is poised to join Paris Saint-Germain in the coming days.\n\nEarlier this month, Dro handed in a transfer request, which was met with a lot of surprise – and anger – within Barcelona. PSG are close to agreeing a deal to sign the 18-year-old midfielder, who was promoted to the first team last summer after impressing Hansi Flick during pre-season.\n\nThe club’s general feeling towards the Dro situation was made clear by president Joan Laporta, who was asked for his reaction when speaking on Catalunya Radio on Sunday, as per MD.\n\n“We will talk about it when it is fully done. He has announced that he will not continue. It is an unpleasant situation. We will be able to redirect the situation as it had been proposed. It has been a surprise. We had agreed on another solution for Dro by the time he turned 18 and surprisingly his agent told us that we couldn’t deliver on what we had agreed upon. We will try to make it end as well as possible in the interest of Barça.”\n\nBarcelona had high hopes for Dro, as Laporta has now made clear. He would have been a player for the first team for many years to come, where he would have been competing alongside the likes of Fermin Lopez and Dani Olmo, as well as fellow La Masia star Guille Fernandez.\n\nBut even more than this, the real kicker for Barcelona is losing Dro for such a small amount. A deal is expected to be finalised for around €8m, which is far below their valuation of the teenage talent.",

    "title": "Editorial: Another Important Week For Sunderland",
    "description": "It’s time to refocus, and with players coming and going at Sunderland this week, will we be sat here this time next week in a stronger position?",
    "fullText": "There’s no denying that Saturday afternoon was probably as bad as it has gotten for us so far this season. We were, to be pretty blunt, crap.\n\nWe’re allowed to be crap occasionally, though, aren’t we? No team is perfect. We were expected to spectacularly struggle this season, and yet here we are, sitting as the only undefeated home side in the division. That’s why, about five minutes after full time, I was able to just shrug it off and look forward, not back.\n\nUntil heavy defeats become a habit, I’ll not be panicking. And before someone says it, no, I’m not pontificating here — this is generally just my default position when it comes to Sunderland. I take the tag of ‘supporter’ incredibly seriously, sometimes to my own detriment, but I’ll always defend the club and the decisions they take if I think they’ve been taken in good faith.\n\n10th in the best league in the world\n\n33 points\n\n15 to play\n\nUnbeaten at home \n\nOver achieving \n\nIncreased expectations \n\nLost after a poor performance \n\nChill out\n\nStay calm\n\nSupport the lads\n\nWe'll be reet\n\nRegards \n\n🔴⚪️\n\n— SJT (@tenchylad) January 24, 2026\n\nThat said, I was a little disappointed to see such an overwhelmingly hysterical reaction to the defeat after the game. I was also buoyed by reading some of the more sensible takes from fans who couldn’t understand why people were getting so carried away, but I’m sure anyone who took even just a cursory glance at the socials during and after Saturday’s game will have noted the way people took seeing Sunderland seriously underperform.\n\nThat’s not just limited to Sunderland and our fans, as fans of all clubs have this element, and it even goes beyond football — I think this is just a fact when it comes to general discourse in 2026. But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be called out if you think something is wrong. I don’t and didn’t agree with some of the comments I saw about our young players, for instance, because we know that there’s a strong chance they’ll read them, and you can only wonder what that could do to their confidence. So, I’d always urge people to think twice about what they post, especially when it comes to young players who are just doing their best for Sunderland.\n\nAnyways – that’s enough of that, I’ll stop wagging my finger and telling people what to do. For now, at least.\n\nLast time #SAFC were in the Premier League, we'd win, draw or (mostly) lose, everyone would go home and crack on with their lives. Now it feels like every result is extrapolated to the extreme. Seen some extraordinary takes today 😅 it's a football match – either side can win.\n\n— Michael Potts (@MichaelPotts_) January 24, 2026\n\nReggie got it wrong at the London Stadium, and it’s not often that we’ve been able to say that, but it’s only fair to point out that he did. Although, as I said on the post-match reaction pod, when the team news dropped, I wasn’t alarmed by any of the players that he selected, so it’d be easy for me to be wise after the occasion, sitting here talking about how he shouldn’t have started Hume on the right or Mayenda up front. I thought the team he picked looked quite attacking and like a side that could go there and take it to West Ham early on, which I think was probably the plan.\n\nWhat we did — and this isn’t something we really do under this manager — is we took a big gamble. We thought we could catch West Ham off guard by approaching things in a manner in which they hadn’t planned for, and as always, the club had things spoiled the night before when it was leaked that Granit Xhaka wouldn’t be starting the game. Still, they tried to keep people guessing by posting videos of him travelling with the team by train and then using his image to promote the match early in the morning. Still, I think by that point it had already gotten out that Granit was going to miss the match, and you have to imagine that got back to West Ham.\n\nThey were like a pack of Hyenas knowing our talisman was missing, and they smelled blood. I have to admit that this is something which worries me about the games coming up. With Granit Xhaka on the pitch, virtually everyone we face fears us, but without him, you can’t help but admit we are significantly weaker.\n\nDo the club need to get a tighter grip on news leaking out? I’d say so. This isn’t the first time this season that a significant piece of team news has filtered through the fanbase on the eve of a game (it happened with Diarra too), and whilst people are keen to know what’s going on, the only people that it benefits are the teams we are facing, who get a leg up and know what to prepare for.\n\nAlong the same lines, it’s probably really important that in such a big week, a lid is kept on our transfer activity too. In the summer the club had several of their deals spoiled by staff members or freelancers who couldn’t keep things buttoned and it didn’t go down well — you might remember that pictures from Granit Xhaka’s photoshoot were leaked way before it was confirmed that he had signed, which you can imagine will have enraged people at the club who always want to deliver this information on their terms. Whether it’s team news or signings, if it’s within our control, we have to stop fuelling the social media rumour mill (and yes, guilty, we here at RR probably help to contribute to that too, but it’s not our job to contain it!) and keep things tight until it’s the right time to let people know — let’s see if that’s the case as the week progresses.\n\nAfter a heavy defeat, you can imagine that it refocuses people. We won’t panic — I don’t think we’re about to make any rash changes in the transfer market as a result of losing one game of football — but it’s often said you learn a lot more about your team after a defeat, and that’s likely to be the case after West Ham, too. It may well be that question marks were hanging over several players, and minds have been made up in the wake of the game. It may well be that we were humming and harring over signing a quality additional midfield player with experience, but having seen how desperately we missed Granit on Saturday, we’ve realised that we need more options if we’re going to finish the season strongly. Let’s wait and see.\n\nWhat’s true is that it’s going to be a bloody long week until we face Burnley. When you get tonked, I always think it’s better if we have another game quickly afterwards so we can just put things right, and I bet that the players in training this week will be absolutely itching to get back to it. However, the Academy of Light will also serve as a stage for significant change, with established and popular players like Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson expected to depart to continue their careers elsewhere. It seems inevitable that both men will leave, and whilst our focus should be on moving forward and to the next game, I do have to wonder what effect losing two popular lads will have on the dressing room. I’m sure their mates will be upset, but it’s all part of the process of growing as a club, and we’ve got to move on.\n\nThe end result, I hope, is that even greater players come through the door in their place and they slot in just as quickly as their contemporaries did over the summer.",

    "description": "Arsenal 2-3 Manchester United: Patrick Dorgu’s stunning volley helped Michael Carrick to deal the league leaders a first home defeat of the season, one week on from ecstasy on derby day",
    "fullText": "There’s an air of Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer to the beginning of this latest interim era at Manchester United. So much has been talked about the club’s missing “DNA”, whatever that may consist of. But under the guidance of Michael Carrick, United are winning big games again - something that historically reflects “The Manchester United Way” - and just like under Solskjaer, a player reborn is at the heart of things.\n\nWith Solskjaer, that was a 21-year-old Marcus Rashford, revitalised after being misused out wide by Jose Mourinho. With Carrick, it’s Patrick Dorgu. The Dane has found new life in a United shirt since being moved forward into a winger role, a year on from being signed as a defensive solution by Ruben Amorim. His instrumental performance against the Gunners, including a screamer that few could have conceived, acted as further proof that he has spent the last 12 months held back by the now former United boss.\n\n\"Pat’s been a big player for us over the last couple of games attacking-wise - he’s scored two goals, but in terms of his threat and athleticism and his quality coming in as well,” Carrick said. “Delighted for him. His two goals (against Arsenal and Manchester City) are very different goals but you get that because he’s put so much into the performances. It’s nice to see him smiling and happy.”\n\nThe early stages held a mirror to Dorgu’s ghost of Old Trafford past. So much of Arsenal’s early joy was coming down the right flank and Dorgu was forced to return to his old post further back, soon finding himself fighting a losing battle against Bukayo Saka.\n\nIt was that duel that sparked the Gunners’ opener, with Saka calmly dinking it over the jockeying player’s leg to Martin Odegaard, who forced the issue by firing it into the six yard box occupied by Jurrien Timber and Lisandro Martinez, attached at the hip. Paul Scholes had warned Martinez not to get too high and mighty on his horse after impressing in last week’s derby and perhaps the Argentinian should have listened, with Odegaard’s pass bouncing off Martinez’s heel and into his own net. “When you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a**e,” Scholes said. He was spot on.\n\nBut from the moment Arsenal took the advantage, they too became seemingly intent on being the architects of their own downfall. Bryan Mbeumo found himself bearing down on goal right from the restart as the Gunners gave it away sloppily in midfield, but they were let off when Bruno Fernandes wildly blasted wide from the pull-back.\n\nMbeumo, United’s top scorer in his maiden season at Old Trafford, maybe should have gone alone and he made sure not to repeat the error when a similar chance was presented to him on a silver platter by the opposition. With the United press closing in, Martin Zubimendi panicked receiving a hospital pass from William Saliba and in trying to play it back to his goalkeeper, the Spaniard set Mbeumo - in his direct eyeline as he played the ball - clean through, with the Cameroonian rounding David Raya to equalise.\n\n“We gave them the goal,” Arteta lamented, struggling to pinpoint why errors proliferated among his players as they allowed United back into the contest. “Errors are a part of football. It was very unlike us but we gave them the goal and hope, and that shifted the energy.” And with renewed spirits, accompanied by the impetus of their new weapon, the visitors came out swinging in the second half.\n\nThough shaky at the back, Dorgu has looked like a new signing going forward. It was something we saw against Newcastle while Ruben Amorim was still in charge, making you wonder just why the stubborn Portuguese boss dragged him back to left wing-back before his eventual sacking. It was in line with his inability to adapt, even when better alternatives were staring him in the face.\n\nDorgu’s stunning volley five minutes after the restart, crashing in off the underside of Raya’s bar, put an exclamation mark on the error of Amorim’s ways. While Arsenal were far too easily cut open by the link-up of Dorgu and Fernandes, it would be unfair to pin such a spectacular effort on defensive shortcomings. “You get them where it kind of takes your breath away,” Carrick said.\n\nDorgu often found himself the furthest United player up the pitch. He had been allowed to abandon his defensive duties, with Carrick aware that the opposition half was where he belonged. That was until he was forced off with a suspected hamstring injury, though Carrick is hopeful it’s nothing serious. “He ended up coming off with a little bit of cramp, hopefully it’s nothing worse. At this stage it’s hard to tell so we’ll just have to wait and see, but we’re hoping it’s not too bad.”\n\nSet pieces appeared to come to Arsenal’s rescue once again as Mikel Merino forced the ball over the line in the 84th minute after a goal-mouth scramble. That was their 15th from a set play this season in England’s top flight. Avoiding defeat would have been a huge let-off for the league leaders who, under fresh pressure from Aston Villa after their win at Newcastle earlier in the day, had not particularly threatened after falling behind.\n\nBut a piece of individual brilliance from Matheus Cunha three minutes later, who found himself in space to unleash a curler after three Arsenal bodies committed and failed to shut down Kobbie Mainoo, sealed the Gunners’ first home defeat of the season.\n\n“We’re going to win the league,” sung the jubilant away end at full-time. They might be getting a bit ahead of themselves. But as Arsenal’s lead at the top was reduced to four points, seeds of doubt may have been planted into whether the Gunners will achieve that elusive feat.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City returned to winning ways on Saturday as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola’s side will be happy to have put consecutive defeats behind them as they now prepare for their final Champions League league phase fixture against Galatasaray. City must beat the Turkish giants to have any chance of finishing in the top eight of the Champions League league phase table. Pep Guardiola has provided an update on the injury status of his squad. The City manager will have to get creative to deal with the players who are unavailable for the Galatasaray match.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s win over Wolves, Pep Guardiola has provided an update on the fitness of his squad for their crucial clash with Galatasaray. The Manchester City manager revealed that Nico will miss the match, as will Rodri through suspension. Speaking on which players will miss Manchester City’s clash with  Galatasaray, in quotes relayed by Hayters TV, Guardiola said: “I know Marc (Guehi) cannot play, Antoine (Semenyo) cannot play, Rodri cannot play, apart from all the players that we have sidelined.”\n\n“Nico Gonzalez will not be ready and Savinho will not be ready and John Stones will not be ready.”\n\nIt is a massive blow for Manchester City to be without Rodri and Nico for their crucial Champions League fixture against Galatasaray. Both players are integral to City’s play. Nico has been superb this season, although, frustratingly, he has been sidelined due to a knock that he sustained in  Manchester City’s 1-all draw with Brighton. Rodri is suspended for the match against Galatasaray after being sent off in Manchester City’s 3-1 defeat to Bodø/Glimt last week. But there does look to be one obvious solution to the issue for Pep Guardiola.\n\nNico O’Reilly is the prime candidate to partner Bernardo Silva in Manchester City’s midfield against Galatasaray. O’Reilly played as a number six in City’s recent 2-nil win over Newcastle United. He played well and didn’t look out of place in midfield. O’Reilly’s energy and athleticism could prove vital against Galatasaray. If O’Reilly were to start in midfield, either Rayan Ait-Nouri or Nathan Ake could start at left-back. Nico O’Reilly has made the left-back position his own this season, but it is highly likely that O’Reilly will be needed in midfield against Galatasaray. So, it seems that Ait-Nouri or Ake will more than likely get the opportunity at left-back.\n\nManchester City will be without Nico and Rodri for their crucial Champions League fixture against Galatasaray. That is a blow for Pep Guardiola’s side. But there does seem to be an obvious option for Pep Guardiola to use in midfield. That is Nico O’Reilly. The young England international now looms as an important player in a match that City must win on Wednesday night at the Etihad.",

    "fullText": "Novak Djokovic will face Lorenzo Musetti in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open after the Italian defeated Taylor Fritz.\n\nDjokovic received a walkover to the last-eight after his fourth-round opponent Jakub Mensik withdrew from the tournament due to injury.\n\nThe 10-time Australian Open champion is bidding to reach a fifth grand slam semi-final in a row at the age of 38 as he seeks more tennis history in Melbourne.\n\nMusetti, the fifth seed, is through to his first Australian Open quarter-final after a convincing 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 victory over the ninth seed Fritz.\n\nDjokovic has beaten Musetti in nine of their 10 meetings, including the last six in a row. Their most recent battle came in the Athens final late last season, as Djokovic won his 101st career title in a three-hour battle.\n\nBefore then, Djokovic also defeated Musetti in the semi-finals of Wimbledon and the Paris Olympics, in two of their four meetings from the 2024 season, while the 23-year-old’s only win came on clay in Monte Carlo in 2023.\n\nDjokovic, who is aiming to win the 25th grand slam title of his career, will have the added bonus of extra recovery time after the 16th seed Mensik withdrew from the tournament with an abdominal injury.\n\n“This is a tough one to write. After doing everything we could to keep going, I have to withdraw from the Australian Open due to an abdominal muscle injury that has progressed over the last matches,” said Mensik, who beat Djokovic in the Miami final last season.\n\n\"After a long discussion with my team and doctors, we decided not to step on court tomorrow.\n\n“Even though I'm disappointed, making the fourth round here for the first time is something I will carry with me for a long time. I felt so much energy from the fans and the atmosphere in Melbourne was truly special.”\n\nDjokovic had previously spoken of the importance of conserving energy in the grand slams after admitting he “ran out of gas” in his US Open semi-final defeat to Jannik Sinner last year.\n\n“There's always something that is happening with the body, but I think generally I feel as good as I have felt in a while,” Djokovic said after his third-round win over Botic van de Zandschulp, where he narrowly avoided being defaulted from the tournament after striking a ball near the head of a ball girl.\n\n\"I cannot predict the future, I don't know how things are going to unfold from this day onwards, but I'm doing everything I can.\"",

    "description": "The Sky Sports pundit praised Carrick’s influence on the club after wins over Man City and Arsenal but believes they need a ‘bigger’ manager",
    "fullText": "Roy Keane shut down suggestions that Michael Carrick be given the role of Manchester United manager on a permanent basis following the 3-2 victory over Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nCarrick took over from the sacked Ruben Amorim on a contract until the end of the current suggestion with the executives at Old Trafford currently searching for a new manager to hire permanently.\n\nIn his first game in charge Carrick orchestrated a 2-0 derby win over Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City before masterminding United’s victory over the league leaders.\n\nKeane was quick to praise the impact Carrick and his staff have had on the players and results but revealed that his preference for the next manager be someone “bigger and better” than Carrick.\n\nAsked for his opinion on the result and the performance from Manchester United, Keane echoed the words of Harry Maguire who was awarded the player of the match trophy.\n\n“Harry makes a good point, they’ve got a lot of their players back now, it’s a full group, they’ve got full weeks together and there’s no other distractions,” Keane replied. “They can focus on the league form and they’re producing.\n\n“But, as we know you win one, two games for Man Utd, fantastic. Particularly to beat City, and come to Arsenal. I felt United would get a result today, I was thinking a draw but I felt United would turn up.\n\n“They’ve got enough quality players and they’ve got momentum into their season and all of a sudden you’re thinking it’s a great chance for top four. If they play with that confidence and belief, you give the manager and the staff credit.”\n\nKeane was then pressed by fellow Sky Sports pundit Micah Richards on whether Manchester United should hire Carrick on a permanent basis already given he has led the team to wins against first and second in the league.\n\n“The job? You’re being silly now,” Keane responded. “No, he’s had two great performances but anybody can win two games. It’s what he does until the end of the season.\n\n“Even if they do get into fourth I still wouldn’t be convinced he’s the man for the job. Absolutely not. I still think they need a bigger and better manager.\n\n“But, he’s got the opportunity, what a chance it is for him and, do you know what, he’s taking it so fair play to him.”",

    "title": "What's New in Pandas 3",
    "description": "pandas 3.0 has just been released. This article uses a real‑world example to explain the most important differences between pandas 2 and...",
    "fullText": "You can connect with me on \n LinkedIn\n to discuss collaborations and work opportunities.\n\nYou can also follow me on\n Twitter,\n Bluesky and\n Mastodon.\n\npandas 3.0 has just been released. This article uses a real‑world example to\nexplain the most important differences between pandas 2 and the new pandas 3\nrelease, focusing on performance, syntax, and user experience.\n\nBefore diving into the technical details of pandas 3, it is worth providing\nsome context on how pandas is developed and what to expect from its release cycle.\n\nMany software projects develop new features in parallel between major releases.\nIf pandas followed this model, development might look like this:\n\nThis is often what users expect. In reality, pandas development follows a\ndifferent approach:\n\npandas does not develop features in parallel across major versions. Instead,\nnew features land continuously on the main development line and are included\nin the next release once they are ready (for example 2.1). As a result,\npandas 3.0 does not include everything developed since pandas 2.0 (released\nalmost three years ago), but primarily what has been added since pandas 2.3,\nwhich was released roughly six months ago.\n\nMost importantly, the pandas developers consistently prioritize backward\ncompatibility. Instead of continuously breaking APIs to improve everything\nthat can be improved, we aim to fix what can reasonably be fixed without\nforcing users to rewrite their codebases. Users maintaining large pandas\nprojects, or those who simply do not want to relearn pandas syntax every\nyear, will likely appreciate this philosophy.\n\nThe downside of this conservative approach is that pandas cannot always offer\nstate‑of‑the‑art performance or a clean and consistent API, and instead will suffer\nfrom some design decisions that made sense a couple of decades ago, but that we would\nimplement differently if we started pandas today. For users starting fresh with\ndataframe‑based projects, it is worth considering Polars,\nwhich could learn from pandas experience to deliver a dataframe library with\nimpressive performance, full Arrow support, and a cleaner and more consistent API.\n\nThat said, pandas 3 still introduces several significant changes that improve\nperformance, syntax, and the overall user experience. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nThe examples in this article use a dataset containing 2,231,577 hotel room records,\nwith the following structure:\n\nWe will start with pandas 2. Our first operation is to add the maximum number of children\na room can accommodate to the maximum number of people (adults), but only for U.S. hotels.\n\nThis produces the infamous warning:\n\nIf you have used pandas for any length of time, you have almost certainly\nseen this before. What is happening can be summarized as follows:\n\nIn practice, most users do not fully understand the underlying issue and handle\nthe warning in one of two ways (often based on advice from StackOverflow or a chatbot):\n\nThe standard solution to this class of problems is copy‑on‑write:\n\nAfter countless hours of work that began well before pandas 3, copy‑on‑write is\nnow fully implemented. The warning is gone, and all the .copy() calls in pandas\ncode can be safely avoided after moving to pandas 3.\n\nLet's revisit the same example, this time focusing on syntax rather than memory behavior.\nFor users who write pandas pipelines rather than interactively exploring data in a notebook,\nthe previous example can be rewritten using method chaining:\n\nThis style avoids repeated assignments and makes the sequence of operations explicit.\nHowever, while method chaining itself makes the code more readable, many users will find\nthis version harder to read, largely because of the required use of lambda,\nwhich is a non‑trivial pandas concept.\n\nIn pandas, column access typically uses either df.column or df[\"column\"].\nWith method chaining, however, the intermediate DataFrame object does not exist as a\nnamed variable at each step. Even if we create df, the df in the assign operation\nis not the DataFrame object at the time of assigning (with only U.S. hotel data), but\nthe original DataFrame with all rows:\n\nThe use of lambda delays evaluation so that column expressions are resolved\nagainst the correct intermediate DataFrame. While effective, this approach using\nlambda makes reading pandas code significantly harder. Other libraries such as\nPolars and PySpark address this more cleanly using a col() expression API.\n\npandas 3 introduces the same mechanism:\n\nThis is a significant step forward, making pandas code much more readable, in particular\nwhen using method chaining. But there is still room for improvement. For comparison,\nthe equivalent filter in Polars looks like this:\n\nUsing an explicit .filter() method makes the operation being performed clearer.\nExperienced Python developers will be familiar with Tim Peter's brilliant\nZen of Python which states that\n\"explicit is better than implicit\". Using df[...] for both filtering and selection is\nsurely convenient, \n\nMore importantly, pandas still relies on the bitwise & operator for combining conditions.\nIdeally, users would write condition1 and condition2, but Python reserves and for\nboolean evaluation and does not allow libraries to override it.\n\nUsing & leads to this surprising behavior:\n\nThe expression is evaluated as 1 == (1 & 2) == 2, not (1 == 1) and (2 == 2).\nThe same happens when each side of the & is a pandas expression. This is why in the previous\nexample [(pandas.col(\"property_type\") == \"hotel\") & (pandas.col(\"country\") == \"us\")] \nconditions must be carefully parenthesized.\n\nSince overriding and, or, and not is not possible in Python, and not likely to be allowed\nanytime soon, the Polars approach is probably the best it can be done. Implementing .filter() and\nallowing passing multiple conditions as different arguments is something that could be\nimplemented in pandas, and will hopefully be available to users in a future version.\n\nAnother important improvement in pandas 3 is better support for user‑defined functions (UDFs).\nIn pandas, UDFs are regular Python functions passed to methods such as .apply() or .map().\n\nIf you have used pandas for a while, you have probably heard that .apply() is considered bad practice:\n\nThis reputation is often deserved. For example, adding max_people and max_children row‑by‑row:\n\nproduces the same result as the vectorized version, but increases execution time from roughly 3 ms\nto 11 seconds (around 4,000x slower).\n\nHowever, not all problems vectorize cleanly. Consider transforming a room name such as\n\"Superior Double Room with Patio View\" into a structured string like:\n\nA fully vectorized solution quickly becomes complex and hard to maintain.\nThis implementation takes around 14 seconds with the example dataset:\n\nThe equivalent UDF is (at least in my opinion) far clearer:\n\nThis version runs in about 22 seconds, roughly 70% slower than the\nvectorized approach, but is far easier to read and maintain.\n\npandas 3 introduces a new execution interface that allows third‑party\nengines to accelerate UDFs. One example is bodo.ai,\nwhich can JIT‑compile both pure Python and pandas code:\n\nWith bodo.ai, the same code runs in around 9 seconds, less than half of\nthe time needed with the standard UDF version, and also 35% faster than\nthe vectorized version. And this speed-up is gained while retaining the\nclarity of the UDF implementation.\n\nAlthough a 35% speed‑up may not sound dramatic, JIT compilation has a\nfixed startup cost, the time to compile the code, which does not depend\non the amount of data processed later. As datasets grow larger, the\nrelative gains increase substantially. For very large datasets,\nthe difference can be dramatic. So, in this example, if we had 100\nmillion rows instead of 2, using bodo.ai would improve performance massively.\n\nCrucially, execution now happens outside pandas itself. This opens the door\nto an ecosystem of specialized execution engines. For example,\nBlosc can accelerate NumPy‑style\nworkloads using compressed memory execution, and works with pandas 3 as\nsimply as bodo, just by using engine=blosc2.jit(). Enabling this ecosystem\nadds endless possibilities. For example, bodo.ai also supports distributed\nexecution on HPC clusters, and other engines may emerge for different use-cases\nand different strategies.\n\nIf you read my earlier article pandas 2.0 and the Arrow revolution,\nyou may be wondering what became of that effort.\n\nAt the time pandas 2 was being released, the core team was committed to\nimplement a more aggressive transition to Apache Arrow. Primarily, to make\nsure users could always benefit from the performance and compatibility enhancements\nArrow provides. This would be particularly relevant for strings, where the legacy\nimplementation is really suboptimal compared to the Arrow one. Ultimately,\nthis plan was scaled back. This is in short what happened:\n\nWith an example, the new strings look like this:\n\nIn the example, the data type is the new str type, and the missing value is\nrepresented by NaN, and when comparing NaN == \"a\" the return is False.\nYou can't know whether the code above uses NumPy's objects internally, or\nArrow strings, since that depends on the environment and not the code itself.\n\nMissing values are not the float NaN anymore but pandas <NA> which is not\nexactly a value itself, but a reference to whether the value is missing or not.\nIn Arrow, a separate array is used to establish which values are missing.\nThe main difference in the example is that <NA> == \"a\" in this case returns\n<NA> and not False as the default pandas 3 implementation.\n\nI'm not personally aware of any current plan or effort to change the pandas 3\nstatus quo significantly. While the new approach is a good trade-off between\nbackward compatibility and allowing users to benefit from Arrow by default, it\ncomes with its drawbacks. Now there are 3 different ways to represent strings,\nsince the PyArrow example above is still valid in pandas 3, as it would be\nsetting dtype=\"object\" and using the original implementation. It may also not\nbe ideal for some users to have the same code running with different implementation\ndepending on whether PyArrow is installed or not. This can be tricky for example\nfor developers of other libraries, who can't make assumptions on what a pandas\nstring is internally.\n\nClearly, the users that will benefit more from the new pandas 3 strings are users\nwith existing codebases concerned about backward compatibility. While the new\nchanges are not fully backward compatible, migrating to pandas 3 should be really\nstraightforward.\n\nUsers who need a simpler and modern dataframe experience based on Arrow, and are\nless concerned about pandas legacy, Polars is a great alternative.\n\nYou can connect with me on \n LinkedIn\n to discuss collaborations and work opportunities.\n\nYou can also follow me on\n Twitter,\n Bluesky and\n Mastodon.",

    "description": "At first,  Andre Neveling found Bangkok's relentless buzz thrilling, but it became overwhelming.",
    "fullText": "As a frequent traveler, I fell in love with Thailand's diverse landscapes, rich culture, and — best of all — the food. So when I experienced career burnout in 2024 after five years in Hong Kong and needed a soft landing, Thailand felt like an instant safe haven.\n\nI knew it like the back of my hand (or so I thought), and with the introduction of the digital nomad DTV visa that same year, the leap felt like a no-brainer.\n\nLiving here has largely lived up to my expectations. Still, the shift from enthusiastic visitor to long-term resident came with challenges I hadn't anticipated.\n\nI began my new life with a three-month immersion in Bangkok, my favorite city in the world. I wanted a familiar landing pad and the festive energy. I learned that even favorites have their downsides.\n\nThe city's relentless buzz — thrilling at first — slowly became overwhelming. The constant motion, traffic, and density fueled my anxiety. In a metropolis so vast, finding genuine silence or peace felt nearly impossible. I often wanted to switch it all off, but Bangkok doesn't come with an off switch.\n\nAs a remote freelancer, I had the freedom to chase a different dream by moving to Phuket. For anyone who's ever wondered what it's like to live there, it really does feel like paradise with a permanent holiday vibe. Even so, I realized how little I'd truly known it as a tourist. I keep discovering corners I'd never seen before.\n\nThen high season arrived. My peaceful paradise transformed into an overtourism nightmare, especially in December and January. Secret beaches swarmed with festival-like crowds, and daily routines fell apart. Food deliveries took hours, shops ran out of staples, and transport apps like Grab and Bolt were overwhelmed.\n\nOn one recent beach day, I couldn't book a ride home for nearly three hours, leaving me stranded in a roadside meltdown. My Zen mood quickly gave way to frustration.\n\nIronically, on an island packed with people, making real connections has felt harder than in Bangkok. With tourists constantly coming and going, most interactions are fleeting. Expat communities exist, but they're scattered and often divided by nationality. Even amid the crowds, island life can feel surprisingly lonely.\n\nThen there's the bureaucracy. Thailand operates with a certain fluidity that can be confusing. Laws around visas, business, and property don't change often, but their interpretation can vary wildly between offices, officers, and provinces.\n\nTake the 90-day reporting rule. It requires expats to report to immigration every 90 days, an outdated system that often pushes people to do quick \"visa runs\" instead of spending a full day in line. Many newcomers don't learn about it until they're hit with a hefty fine.\n\nI've since joined expat groups just to keep up with the ever-shifting rules.\n\nThailand's sex industry is impossible to ignore in heavy tourist zones. Living here, I've had to build a certain emotional distance from it. When I first arrived in Phuket, I stayed in a room next to a tourist who was clearly there for that purpose. For a week straight, I was an unwilling audience to noisy transactions — until I finally complained to management.\n\nAnd as a foreigner, you're often placed in the \"tourist\" box by default. I thought Tinder might be a way to meet people. Instead, half my matches offered a \"massage\" rather than a conversation.\n\nThailand is known for its affordability, but a clear divide still exists between local and foreign pricing. You have to stay vigilant to avoid overpaying. The reward comes with time. As I've settled in and become a regular at local markets and shops, I'm now greeted with smiles — and the occasional \"special price.\"\n\nThat, in the end, is what makes all the headaches fade.\n\nFor every moment of frustration, there are many more filled with beauty, incredible food, and genuine kindness. The trade-offs are real, and the challenges come with the territory.\n\nBut most days, when I look around at the place I now call home, the struggles feel like a small price to pay for living in a real-life paradise.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "fullText": "Anna Kendrick, 40, says watching her friends go to college made her second-guess her decision to pursue acting.\n\n\"I was really, really jealous of all my friends that were going to college. Number one, because I felt really insecure about not going to college. I have a whole, you know, complex about it,\" Kendrick said on Friday's episode of \"Call Her Daddy.\"\n\nSeeing her friends quickly build community through classes and sororities made her feel even more unsure as she tried to find her footing in Los Angeles.\n\n\"I was 17 or 18. It's really hard to make friends in LA because of, like, the way the city is laid out, but especially when you don't have a fake ID. Even if I did, I looked about 12, so that wasn't going to work anyway,\" Kendrick said. \"And I was just like absolutely terrified and really wondering if I was like, making a huge mistake.\"\n\nHer perspective began to change when her friends hit sophomore year and had to start figuring out their future paths.\n\n\"Even though the thing that I wanted felt like a total pipe dream, and like, 'What am I doing? This is a disaster. It's so hard to carve out a space for yourself in this industry,'\" Kendrick said.\n\n\"But on the other side of it, holy shit, I did not think like, what a blessing to just know what I want. I was like watching all my friends go, 'Oh my god, I don't know what I want, what to do,'\" she continued.\n\nThe \"Pitch Perfect\" star said her decision not to go to college felt especially difficult because it went against the path her family valued.\n\n\"I was like the first person to not go to college. And my dad was a teacher and everything, so it was like very black sheep behavior to not go to college,\" Kendrick said.\n\nShe added her parents weren't thrilled with her decision, but accepted that she was going to do what she wanted. At the same time, her parents saw college as something she could revisit if acting didn't work out.\n\n\"I think there was always that sense of like, well, if things maybe don't work out that first year, it's not too late to just, you know, so I think that was always like something that they had in mind,\" Kendrick said.\n\nIt also didn't help that questions about college kept coming up when she was in her early 20s, before her acting career had fully taken off.\n\n\"Like, oh my god, I have to say I didn't. And at that point, you know, like 21, 22, I didn't really have much to show for it yet,\" Kendrick said.\n\nKendrick isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has spoken about not going to college.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" star Daniel Radcliffe told E! News in 2013 that he skipped college because he \"already knew\" what he wanted to do.\n\n\"I think a large part of why people go to college is to figure out what they want to do,\" he said. \"I very much knew what I wanted to do, so I kind of just figured I'd keep carrying on trying to do that.\"\n\nIn 2024, Julia Roberts told British Vogue that she regrets not going to university.\n\n\"It wasn't in my cards,\" Roberts said, adding that her family didn't have the money and she \"had no scholarship potential.\"",

    "fullText": "A major winter storm blanketed the US this weekend with heavy snow and ice, threatening nearly 180 million Americans from the Southwest to New England.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) said there were widespread travel disruptions due to the storm. Over 10,000 flights were canceled over the weekend, the most since the pandemic, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Nearly 2,000 are already canceled on Monday morning, and authorities are urging many Americans to skip the morning commute.\n\nTake a look at the impact of the potentially historic storm below.\n\nSnow turned to ice in many affected states as the storm moved from the Southwest to the Northeast.\n\nThe Departments of Transportation in several states, including New York and Texas, have urged residents to avoid roadways during the winter storm and through Monday.\n\nSome Americans ventured into the frosty weather with skis, including folks in Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.\n\nAviation analytics company Cirium said over 10,000 flights were canceled over the weekend. Nearly 2,000 flights have been canceled so far on Monday. Over 50% of American Airlines flights were canceled on Sunday and over 75% of JetBlue flights.\n\nIce and sleet are other factors at play during the winter storm. On Sunday, the National Service Prediction Center said parts of the country have received over 0.5 inches of ice.\n\nIce storm warnings remained in effect for much of the storm's path.\n\nThe power was out for nearly a million Americans by Sunday night, according to poweroutage.us, an analytics firm tracking electricity outages across the United States.\n\nTexas and other states were seeing the most outages as of Sunday evening.\n\nSalt is spread on roadways to improve traction and make plowing easier.\n\nIn Louisville, city workers used a mixture of salt and calcium chloride.\n\n\"Calcium chloride helps salt remain effective in extremely cold temperatures,\" the city said on its website.\n\nWhile many Americans stayed inside, swaths of workers across the country braved the weather to help clear snow and perform other storm-related tasks.\n\nNew York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani praised city workers in an X post on Sunday, writing, \"Thank you to all of the city workers who have been working around the clock this weekend to keep us safe. No job is too small, no storm is too big.\"\n\nNew York City's public schools have canceled in-person classes on Monday due to the \"extreme cold.\" Instead, students will do remote learning.

    "fullText": "Can AI feel anything at all? Anthropic's in-house philosopher says the answer isn't settled.\n\nAmanda Askell, who works on shaping Claude's behavior, said in an episode of the \"Hard Fork\" podcast published Saturday that the debate over AI consciousness remains difficult.\n\n\"Maybe you need a nervous system to be able to feel things, but maybe you don't,\" Askell said. \"The problem of consciousness genuinely is hard,\" she added.\n\nLarge language models are trained on vast amounts of human-written text, material filled with descriptions of various emotions and inner experience. Because of that, Askell said she is \"more inclined\" to believe that models are \"feeling things.\"\n\nWhen humans get a coding problem wrong, they often express annoyance or frustration. It \"makes sense\" that models trained on those conversations may mirror that reaction, Askell explained.\n\nAskell added that scientists still don't know what gives rise to sentience or self-awareness — whether it requires biology, evolution, or something else entirely.\n\n\"Maybe it is the case that actually sufficiently large neural networks can start to kind of emulate these things,\" she said, referring to consciousness.\n\nAskell also said that models are continuously learning about themselves, and she voiced concern about how AI models are learning from the internet. Models are constantly exposed to criticism about being unhelpful or failing at tasks, she said.\n\n\"If you were a kid, this would give you kind of anxiety,\" she said.\n\n\"If I read the internet right now and I was a model, I might be like, I don't feel that loved,\" she added.\n\nTech leaders remain divided over whether AI has consciousness.\n\nMicrosoft's AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, has taken a firm stance against that idea. He said in an interview with WIRED published in September that the industry must be clear that AI is designed to serve humans, not develop its own will or desires.\n\n\"If AI has a sort of sense of itself, if it has its own motivations and its own desires and its own goals — that starts to seem like an independent being rather than something that is in service to humans,\" he said. \"That's so dangerous and so misguided that we need to take a declarative position against it right now.\"\n\nHe added that AI's increasingly convincing responses amount to \"mimicry\" rather than genuine consciousness.\n\nOthers see the issue less definitively. Google DeepMind's principal scientist, Murray Shanahan, said the industry might need to rethink the language used to describe consciousness itself.\n\n\"Maybe we need to bend or break the vocabulary of consciousness to fit these new systems,\" Shanahan said in an episode of the Google DeepMind podcast published in April.",

That plan would require cutting discretionary spending and selling nonessential items, including the trailer, but keeping the house.\n\n\"This process of 14 months of sacrifice, y'all are never going to be the same,\" Ramsey said, adding that selling the house would not change behavior.",

    "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China.  Carney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.",
    "fullText": "TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Sunday his country has no intention of pursuing a free trade deal with China. He was responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada if America’s northern neighbor went ahead with a trade deal with Beijing.\n\nCarney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.\n\nTrump claims otherwise, posting that “China is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen. I only hope they leave Ice Hockey alone! President DJT”\n\nThe prime minister said under the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico there are commitments not to pursue free trade agreements with nonmarket economies without prior notification.\n\n“We have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy,” Carney said. “What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that developed in the last couple of years.”\n\nIn 2024, Canada mirrored the United States by putting a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from Beijing and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. China had responded by imposing 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.\n\nBreaking with the United States this month during a visit to China, Carney cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on those Canadian products.\n\nCarney has said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports coming into Canada at a tariff rate of 6.1%, growing to about 70,000 over five years. He noted there was no cap before 2024. He also has said the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.\n\nTrump posted a video Sunday in which the chief executive of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association warns there will be no Canadian auto industry without U.S. access, while noting the Canadian market alone is too small to justify large scale manufacturing from China.\n\n“A MUST WATCH. Canada is systematically destroying itself. The China deal is a disaster for them. Will go down as one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history. All their businesses are moving to the USA. I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE! President DJT,\" Trump posted on social media.\n\nTrump's post on Saturday said that if Carney “thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”\n\n“We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\n“We have a (United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement), but based off -- based on that, which is going to be renegotiated this summer, and I’m not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos.”\n\nTrump’s threat came amid an escalating war of words with Carney as the Republican president’s push to acquire Greenland strained the NATO alliance.\n\nCarney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. under Trump. Speaking in Davos before Trump, Carney said, “Middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu” and he warned about coercion by great powers — without mentioning Trump’s name. The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the World Economic Forum.\n\nTrump’s push to acquire Greenland has come after he has repeatedly needled Canada over its sovereignty and suggested it also be absorbed into the United States as a 51st state. He posted an altered image on social media this week showing a map of the United States that included Canada, Venezuela, Greenland and Cuba as part of its territory.",

    "fullText": "The author at a baptism in September 2017. \"I'm happy and healthy here,\" he writes.\n\nMy day had started early that Friday. My wife, Joanne, and I arrived at 7 a.m. for my 10-year follow up colonoscopy with Dr. Smith. Although I had referred a number of my patients to his group, I hadn’t worked much with him or even met him. As the nurse was going through her checklist of tasks, she casually mentioned that he was retiring that day and a party was scheduled that evening.\n\nI was taken into the procedure room on time and 30 minutes later I woke up in the recovery room.\n\n“Dr. Mieczkowski, everything went well,” Dr. Smith told me. “I removed one large polyp and a few smaller ones, but none of them concern me. My office will let you know the results in a few days.”\n\nI thanked him and offered best wishes on his retirement, thinking that I would never see him again. I was relieved ― no signs of cancer.\n\nJoanne and I went home to eat lunch. Since I felt well, we drove to the office to do some paperwork. Around 2:45 p.m., I had an urgent need to use the bathroom and passed streaks of blood. I knew this was common after a colonoscopy, so I didn’t tell Joanne or call the doctor’s office. Fifteen minutes later, I felt more urgency and made another hurried trip to the bathroom.  There was more blood ― a lot more blood.\n\n“Oh shit! Damn it,” I said out loud.\n\nI told Joanne what was going on, and she asked, “Do you want me to call the EMTs? Are you feeling faint?” We decided to drive ourselves to a hospital only a few miles away. I called the physician’s office with an update while we were on our way.\n\nUpon arrival, I was relieved to see that the waiting room was empty. I checked in at the desk and a few minutes later, a nurse opened the door. “Dr. Mieczkowski? Come on back,” she told me.\n\nI made it. I’m going to be all right, I thought. I took a deep breath of relief as Joanne and I walked through the door and were led to my room. The nurse did the usual check-in tasks, connected me to the monitor tracking my heart rate and blood pressure, put an IV in my arm, and drew blood for testing.\n\n“No running fluids?” I questioned. “That’ll be up to the doctor after he sees you,” she replied. As she finished, I felt an urgent need to move my bowels and requested a bedside commode. I quickly passed several pints of blood, which nearly filled the container. I had just lost nearly 20% of my blood volume. I was  stunned and knew that I was in trouble.\n\n“So, you’re Dr. Mieczkowski,” Dr. Woods, the ER doctor, said sarcastically as he walked in. Great! Here we go, I thought. “Yup, that’s me,” I replied, trying to reduce the tension. I pointed out the blood in the commode, but Dr. Woods didn’t seem impressed.\n\nWhile taking my medical history and doing a brief exam, he was constantly looking up at the monitor, which showed a heart rate of 62 and a normal blood pressure. (Typically, a person’s heart rate goes up to compensate for blood loss.) He commented on the low heart rate as an indication that I was stable. I was puzzled. “Dr. Woods, I’m on a high dose of a beta blocker for my blood pressure,” I told him. “My heart rate is always around 50 and never gets above 80.” It didn’t alter his thinking. I asked whether he was going to start running IV fluids and order blood transfusions. “You look pretty stable,” he answered. “I think we can hold off for now until the labs come back. We’ll see how it goes.”\n\nI was dumbfounded. I had 40 years of experience. If I saw that amount of blood loss in a 62-year-old male with heart disease on aspirin ― a potent blood thinner ― I would have called for an immediate GI (gastrointestinal) consult, started IV fluids, and ordered blood to be ready for transfusion. Unfortunately, he jumped to a conclusion that my bleeding couldn’t be serious since my heart rate was low.  He was running the show and damned if he was going to listen to me.\n\nI continued to pass a large amount of blood every 20-30 minutes. Since the blood-filled commode had not been emptied, I used the bathroom across the hall. I was not thinking clearly at this point and failed to note the blood loss was not being measured. I always ordered nurses to monitor a patient’s blood loss and urine output. I became weaker and paler with each episode, and I began to worry that I was going to bleed out. I held back on sharing my fears with Joanne.\n\nThe author on \"a bad day at home in June 2018,\" he writes. \"This was seven months after hemorrhage. I was still trying to work and find an attorney to sue the doctors for malpractice.\"\n\nMy condition deteriorated as the hours passed in the ER. The lab results documented the drop in my blood volume. My anxiety level grew ― another sign of worsening shock. I buzzed the nurse’s station and asked to have Dr. Woods come back. When he arrived, I went through my list of concerns. I asked again about getting blood and platelet transfusions.\n\n“Where’s the GI consult for a repeat colonoscopy?” I asked. Dr. Woods had had enough of my questions. He interrupted me and said, “You know, Dr. Mieczkowski, you may have more grey hair in your beard than me, but this isn’t my first rodeo.” My wife and I looked at each other stunned! He went on, “I think you’re overreacting, and I’m sure you’re anxious. Why don’t I give you some lorazepam to calm you down.” I was in the hands of a doctor I didn’t know or trust, and he refused to listen to my concerns.\n\nIt was around 5:30 p.m. at this point. Then, to my surprise, Dr. Smith entered my room. He asked a few questions, peeked into the bedside commode, listened to my heart and abdomen and poked around a bit. I reiterated my worries and asked directly, “Are you going to do a repeat colonoscopy now?” He paused for a long while before finally answering, “Why don’t we wait this out and do a repeat colonoscopy tomorrow morning if you’re still bleeding. I’ll admit you to the hospitalist service.”\n\nI knew from my own experiences that physicians always have to weigh the pros and cons of doing another procedure versus close observation. He had to know that a GI bleed is more serious in an older patient with heart disease on a blood thinner. What was I supposed to do now? We obviously disagreed about the next steps, but I couldn’t plead my case any further. He was delaying a potentially lifesaving procedure ― one of the major causes of serious adverse events. I couldn’t help but think that the evening retirement party influenced his decision.\n\nAround 7 p.m., one of the hospitalists on duty visited me. He was thorough and, unlike Dr. Woods, he was respectful of my experience. He gave orders for blood and platelet transfusions, started IV fluids and admitted me to a medical unit upstairs. Since he was ending his shift, he assured me the night shift hospitalist would check in on me. Joanne and I were anxious to get out of the emergency room and off the hands of Dr. Woods. I was relieved.\n\nUnfortunately, my bleeding continued in my new room. I noted that my nurse placed a basin in the toilet to measure my blood loss.  When she saw the volume, she was startled and asked if I had been experiencing that level of blood loss all day. “Yes, and they never measured the blood loss,” Joanne told her.\n\nThe hours passed, and I lost track of time. I kept asking, “Where’s the blood?”  The nurse kept replying, “It’s been ordered. We’re still waiting.” I was getting colder and less aware of my surroundings. I drifted in and out of sleep but felt my wife’s hand on me constantly. I knew she was scared. I was bleeding out, albeit more slowly than a person with a gunshot wound in their abdomen.\n\nIt was around 11:30 p.m. when a sense of calm started to come over me ― it was an acceptance that I might die peacefully in bed. So this is what it feels like to die, I thought. I was no longer afraid. “I’m going to die,” I said in a whisper. I can’t imagine how Joanne felt. My nurse got startled briefly, but she was experienced with critically ill patients and called in her team.\n\nWithin seconds more nurses arrived, and they took control since the hospitalist was nowhere to be found. Two additional IV catheters were placed for rapid infusion of fluids and blood in order to keep me alive. My nurse phoned Dr. James, the on-call GI specialist and one of my friends. She gave him an update and then handed me the phone. “Larry, we need to do the colonoscopy now,” he told me. “I’ll be there within the hour.”\n\nThe author, his wife Joanne and their mini-bernedoodle, Cookie, in July 2020.\n\nThe blood and platelets were delivered soon after, and within minutes it seemed the internal bleeding was slowing since the cramping and urgency had lessened. At 1:30 a.m., the nurses wheeled me down to the endoscopy suite. Dr. James arrived, and I was asleep within seconds of getting the anesthetic. He used four titanium clips to clamp an artery bleeding from the site of where the large polyp had been removed. Lab testing confirmed that I had lost nearly 50% of my blood volume.\n\nI was discharged later that Saturday morning. Unfortunately, the shock and blood loss had damaged my heart, kidneys, and affected my thinking and memory. My condition worsened and after undergoing tests locally and at the Mayo Clinic, I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, stage III kidney failure and chronic anemia. Despite adjustment in medicines, I still couldn’t handle the rigorous requirements of practicing medicine and my daily life, and I was advised by my PCP to stop working and pursue disability.\n\nIt was very difficult to accept this recommendation, and I was very angry. I loved my work. I had just moved into a newly remodeled office and, because I was so ill, I didn’t have six months to negotiate the sale of my practice ― I had to close my business. I tried to get a malpractice lawyer to represent me but after six rejections I was finished. Fortunately, I had good disability insurance.\n\nWhy do physicians miss a diagnosis or screw up on treatment plans? What’s more, why do too many of them not listen to their patients ― the most basic thing that should be a fundamental part of their practice?\n\nDr. Woods didn’t really want to consider my concerns, but he and Dr. Smith also failed to put all the pieces of the puzzle together, whether it was because of ego, putting too much importance on my low heart rate, or being distracted by a retirement party. They both had plenty of time for my evaluation and should have thoughtfully weighed my worries.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience is common since adverse events occur in a reported 25% of hospital admissions. If you find yourself in one of these adverse events like I did, here is some advice that may be useful:\n\n1. Resist yelling at the nurse or physician. It doesn’t help, and you may get labeled as “a difficult patient,” which could make matters worse.\n\n2. If you are not being heard, get the unit’s charge nurse or manager involved early in the conflict since any delay may be a life-or-death issue. Because patients are randomly assigned to a hospital-based physician, these nurses can arrange a transfer to another physician’s care or get other specialists involved.\n\n3. If you’re very ill and at a small community hospital, you should consider pushing for a transfer to a larger hospital and, if necessary, contact the hospital’s quality, risk management, or medical director’s office. This almost always guarantees action since no hospital wants to be sued.\n\n4. Outpatient medical practice is very different from hospital-based care. The former is now volume driven and also rife with missed diagnoses, delays in treatment and unsatisfactory office visits. Nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA) have similar outcomes as physicians, often have more time to spend with their patients and have high satisfaction ratings. However, ask to schedule a visit with the physician if you’re dissatisfied with the care of the NP or PA.\n\n5. Improving communication with your provider may be aided by bringing another person with you to your appointment and having them serve as an advocate.\n\nThe author at home in July 2021.\n\n6. Since computers are now standard in most exam rooms, a provider may only spend 8-10 minutes face to face with you during a 20-minute appointment.  Prepare for your visit by reading about your problem. For example, the Cleveland Clinic’s website has a great graphic depicting which organs may be causing abdominal pain. Type a list of your concerns but keep it focused, as, unfortunately, most physicians don’t have time to thoroughly address a long list of issues. Review your list with the medical assistant and ask them to scan it into your records.\n\n7. Primary care providers may not consider a diagnosis they don’t often see.  Requesting an ultrasound if the pain is severe or not improving may save your life. If the provider says that you don’t need it, you can get a self-funded ultrasound for less than $200 in many states. Take your concerns to the office manager or a director overseeing the practice.\n\n8. Unfortunately, I don’t see a return to the times when doctors spent 30 minutes with a patient. Paying PCPs more for their time would quickly change the system, but it’s not going to happen. Medicine has morphed into big business with trillions of dollars spent each year. Finding a great provider may be a challenge but there are well-trained doctors, NPs and PAs out there who will listen to you. Word of mouth referrals are often the best. Reviews of physicians on hospital websites are not helpful in my experience, so check out independent sites when possible.\n\n9. View your first couple of visits with a new practice as an interview and move on if it’s not a fit. Remember, you can always end a long-standing relationship with a practice. If you decide to divorce your provider, send a certified letter to the administrator of the practice explaining why you are leaving.\n\nWe physicians know the healthcare system is broken. Hospital executives are overpaid. Since PCPs are paid on average $180,000 versus the $500,000 an orthopedic surgeon makes, the best and brightest medical students often pursue highly paid specialty positions. Physicians are overbooked, overwhelmed, tired and burned out. Computerized medical records have made it worse. The end result is often poor patient outcomes. Since you can’t change the system, you have to learn how to navigate through its waves using some of the suggestions that I have made.\n\nAfter my experience, I was certain that I wouldn’t survive a year but it’s now been over five years. My kidney function and anemia have improved. I am still dealing daily with my heart failure, restricting salt, resting for hours at a time and reducing my activities. I was able to resume golfing. Through my physicians’ support and the love and tender care of my wife and others, I have accepted what happened to me. It’s not what I had envisioned a decade ago, but I have a good quality of life. In the end, I survived, but I came too close to death that should have been easily prevented.\n\nNote: Names and some identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in this essay.\n\nThis piece was originally published in April 2023 and is running again now as part of HuffPost Personal’s “Best Of” series.\n\nAlso in Goodful: What Happened To This Woman's Head During Menopause Is Something You Have Got To See To Believe\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"We Reported Her\": Patients Are Sharing The Most Unprofessional Things Doctors Have Said To Them, And It's Horrifying\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Knew Instantly That He Would Be Dead Soon\": Doctors Are Sharing The Biggest Health Issues Patients Ignored Until It Was Too Late, And Whew, I've Been Warned",

Ted Cruz’s (R-TX) expense over a fake X post accusing the governor of being out of town during the massive winter storm that brought dangerous amounts of snow and ice to many parts of the U.S.\n\nCruz posted a “thinking” emoji along with a retweet of a post by the Kentucky Freedom Coalition showing Beshear and his wife posing in front of a church in Europe.\n\nThe account, that’s also followed by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) posted, “The liberal media went wild when Ted Cruz wasn’t in Texas for the major freeze a few years back.

    "fullText": "As kids, there was always that one place we begged our parents to take us to, or got excited about visiting for a birthday party or a school field trip.\n\nAfter all, kids' fixations are simple: Give them pizza and entertainment, and they'll happily stay occupied for hours. When a business offers both, it often becomes a welcome break for parents as well.\n\nEveryone has their own version of that place, whether it's Chuck E. Cheese, Dave & Buster's, or Main Event. Over the years, these spots have become go-to destinations for families across the country. In Texas, however, one chain has long stood apart as a source of Lone Star pride.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza began in 1964 as a small restaurant called \"The Pizza Place\" in Stephenville, Texas. Five years later, it relocated to Austin and was renamed Mr Gatti's, in honor of the founder's wife's maiden name.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Mr Gatti's brand expanded into a chain and introduced buffet-style dining, an innovation that helped distinguish it from competitors.\n\nAlthough the Austin restaurant predated the first Chuck E. Cheese location (which opened in San Jose, California, in 1977), Mr Gatti's didn't really jump onto the entertainment-plus-pizza trend until the 1980s. The concept quickly won over families, and today Mr Gatti's Pizza operates more than 200 locations across Texas and the southeastern U.S.\n\nIndustry experts say this hybrid model has become increasingly valuable as traditional casual dining struggles to compete for consumers. According to a 2025 McKinsey & Company survey, 45% of surveyed consumers have reduced their spending at pizza restaurants.\n\n\"When there's good entertainment and good experiences, check averages go up,\" Downtown Restaurant Investments President and BYOD CEO Dave Dittenber told Restaurant Dive.\n\nDittenber added that entertainment only works when paired with strong service and quality food.\n\nMr Gatti's Pizza has sold a majority stake in its business to OneRyan Global LLC, the family office of businessman and philanthropist G. Brint Ryan, according to a press release. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nOneRyan has been a franchisee of Mr Gatti's Pizza since 2022, but its involvement with the brand has steadily expanded.\n\nIn September 2025, OneRyan acquired a minority stake in the company and, a month later, purchased a corporate-owned restaurant at South Park Meadows in Austin. That transaction completed Mr Gatti's Pizza's transition to a fully franchised system and concluded the re-franchising of all company-owned locations.",

Human Rights Council in Geneva, voicing concerns for detainees.\n\nThe council passed a motion extending a previous inquiry set up in 2022 so U.N. investigators could also document the ⁠latest unrest \"for potential future legal ‌proceedings\".\n\nRights groups say bystanders were among those killed during the biggest crackdown since Shi'ite Muslim clerics took power in the 1979 revolution. Tehran has blamed \"terrorists ‍and rioters\" backed by exiled opponents and foreign foes the U.S. and Israel.\n\nIran's mission decried the rights council's \"politicised\" resolution and rejected external interference, saying in a statement it had its own independent and robust accountability ​mechanisms to investigate \"the root causes of recent events\".\n\nTwenty-five states including France, Mexico and South Korea ‌voted in favour, while seven including China and India voted against and 14 abstained.\n\n\"This is the worst mass murder in the contemporary history of Iran,\" Payam Akhavan, a former U.N. prosecutor of Iranian-Canadian nationality, told the meeting. He called for a \"Nuremberg moment\", referring to the international criminal trials of Nazi leaders following World War Two.\n\nIran's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Ali Bahreini, told ⁠the Council its emergency session was invalid and gave ​Tehran's tally of some 3,000 people killed in the ​unrest.\n\nOne Iranian official, however, has told Reuters that at least 5,000 people, including 500 members of the security forces, had been killed.\n\nThe U.S.-based HRANA rights group ‍said it has so ⁠far verified 4,519 unrest-linked deaths and had 9,049 additional deaths under review.\n\nChina, Pakistan, Cuba and Ethiopia also questioned the utility of the rights session, with Beijing's ambassador Jia Guide ⁠calling the unrest in Iran \"a matter of internal affairs\".\n\nIt was unclear who would cover the costs of the extended ‌U.N. inquiry amid a funding crisis that has stalled other probes.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nDave Ramsey has never been shy about what really grinds his gears when it comes to the financial habits of young Americans.\n\nIn a 2024 interview with Fox News, Ramsey — a boomer — shared his true feelings about millennials and Gen-Z’s financial habits: ”They are awful. They live in their mother’s basement. They can’t figure out why they can’t buy a house because they don’t work. (1)”\n\nWhile this sentiment may ring true for people of any generation, younger Americans certainly have some odds stacked against them amidst high home prices and interest rates.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nA Consumer Affairs report found that Gen Z’s money had 86% less purchasing power than baby boomers did when they were in their twenties (2).\n\nRamsey isn’t frustrated with all Millennials and Gen Z in this age. But he says today’s tough economy — and young Americans’ spending habits — are what’s really holding them back.\n\n“We have record credit card debt,” Ramsey said on his show last month (3).\n\nThe numbers add up. Total household debt hit $18.59 trillion in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Credit card balances, on the other hand, rose by $24 billion from the previous quarter to $1.23 trillion (4).\n\n“They've been brainwashed to believe by the big banks that if I use a credit card, I can prosper with the points and the airline miles, which is mathematically ludicrous,” Ramsey added further.\n\nCreating a budget and overall financial plan can be the exact spark you need to ignite to improve your financial situation. In a video with his daughter, Rachel Cruze, on her YouTube channel, Ramsey shared that getting on a budget is one of the best things you can do with your money in 2024.\n\nA quick daily check-in of your accounts can show you exactly where your money is going.\n\nAn app like Rocket Money can easily flag recurring subscriptions, upcoming bills and unusual charges by pulling in transactions from all your linked accounts.\n\nThis can help you cut unnecessary costs, and then you can manually redirect savings straight into your retirement fund.

    "fullText": "About two weeks ago, Verizon scored a significant win in its battle to hold onto its customers longer.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission approved the phone carrier’s request to waive a rule that required it to automatically unlock a phone it sells to a customer after 60 days.\n\nVerizon was first required to follow this rule in 2008, after it purchased licenses to use 700 MHz spectrum. The requirement was reaffirmed when Verizon acquired TracFone in 2021.\n\nIn its request, Verizon argued that the phone unlocking rule has contributed to “device fraud” and has made phones less affordable for low-income customers.\n\nDespite Verizon facing pushback from consumers and advocacy groups who flagged the move as “anti-consumer behavior,” the FCC approved the phone carrier’s request, citing that Verizon saw a 55% increase in fraud after its 2021 purchase of TracFone required it to adhere to a 60-day lock policy.\n\nThe FCC said Verizon’s stolen handsets have even been resold on the dark web at premium prices, “particularly in countries like Russia, China, and Cuba,” according to a press release.\n\n“By waiving a regulation that incentivized bad actors to target one particular carrier’s handsets for theft, we now have a uniform industry standard that can help stem the flow of handsets into the black market,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr in the press release.\n\nShortly after Verizon received the green light from the FCC to set its own phone unlocking rules, just as its competitors do, the phone carrier informed customers of the updated policy.\n\nDevices purchased on or after Jan. 20 from Verizon’s prepaid brands, including Total Wireless, Visible, StraightTalk, and Tracfone, will be unlocked only upon request after 365 days (previously 60 days), and only if several conditions are met, according to a recent report from Droid Life.\n\nThis includes the requirement that the phone has reached 365 days of paid and active service. It is important to note that stopping payments will pause progress toward that 365-day requirement.\n\nCustomers must have an active plan on that device. And if the device was reported stolen or lost, or if there are signs of fraud, it will not be eligible for unlocking.\n\nIn addition, the smartphone’s usage must comply with the company’s Terms of Service.\n\nSo far, the device unlock policy for postpaid phones has not changed, meaning that for now, those devices will continue to unlock after 60 days.\n\nThe updated policy from Verizon has sparked backlash from consumers, who took to social media platform Reddit to express frustration with the change.\n\n“Really is a shame that one of the few affordable ways for low-income folks to get a decent unlocked cell phone was closed,” wrote one Reddit user.\n\n“Just disgusting The entire 60-day unlocking period was designed to add fairness in order to improve their already ridiculous merger with TracFone which never should have been approved in the first place. And now you have the most anti-consumer FCC ever and they get this ridiculous waivrr. It's just so depressing. That was the last decent unlocking policy in the entire United States,” wrote another.\n\n“Well what SUCKS is if you were to buy a phone on installments, pay it off, and not be able to have it unlocked for a year,” wrote another user.\n\nVerizon’s move to extend its device unlocking policy from 60 days to 365 days for its prepaid brands comes as more consumers across the country contemplate switching phone carriers. Customers have grappled with higher monthly bills, according to a survey from Market Force Information last year.\n\nApproximately 65% of consumers use phone services from the \"Big 3\" carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T, spending more than $100 per month on their wireless services.\n\nOn average, Verizon customers pay more than $150 for service.\n\nAbout 23% of Verizon customers are considering switching to another carrier in the next year or two, citing better pricing, promotions, and coverage as the primary reasons.\n\nVerizon scored 40% in overall brand performance across customer experience metrics.\n\nSmaller wireless carriers such as Consumer Cellular and Mint Mobile scored 73% and 65.8%, respectively.\n\n\"There's a clear shift in the market towards smaller, more agile wireless carriers who are delivering superior customer experiences,\" said David Murray, senior director of client strategy at Market Force Information, in a press release.\n\n\"While cost and coverage are always key factors, today's consumers are placing more importance on ease of service and overall satisfaction with their provider,” he continued.\n\nAmid this growing trend, Verizon lost 7,000 postpaid phone customers during the third quarter of 2025, according to the company’s most recent earnings report.\n\nThe loss comes after Verizon rolled out price hikes earlier in the year, a move the company’s new CEO said was one of the top reasons why customers left.\n\nT-Mobile announces free offer for Verizon and AT&T customers\n\n​​Verizon CEO sounds alarm on why customers are leaving in droves\n\nSpectrum raises red flag on cause of fleeing customer problem\n\n“For the past few years, our financial growth has relied too heavily on price increases, a strategic approach that relies too much on price without subscriber growth is not a sustainable strategy,” said Verizon CEO Dan Schulman during an earnings call in October. “Every year, it gets harder to grow as we lap past price increases and experience higher churn. This cannot continue, and there is no question that meaningful change is needed.”\n\nHe also vowed to transform the company by removing customer pain points and increasing value. Schulman also stated that Verizon’s transformation will not be “about promotional activities that can be quickly imitated.”\n\n“It is about true innovation, not easily replicated by our competitors,” he said.\n\nIt is vital for Verizon to double down on customer retention, especially after the company suffered a major service outage last week that lasted about 10 hours, affecting roughly 1.5 million customers across multiple states.\n\nAlso, a recent J.D. Power survey found the company lags T-Mobile in consumer satisfaction for postpaid and prepaid plans.\n\nThe average consumer satisfaction score for postpaid plans under traditional carriers is 593 (on a 1,000-point scale). For prepaid plans, the average score is 601.\n\nSpecifically, T-Mobile ranks the highest in postpaid and prepaid, with satisfaction scores of 636 and 617, respectively.\n\nVerizon takes second place in both segments, with a 583 score for postpaid plans and 595 for prepaid plans.\n\nAT&T falls behind Verizon with a satisfaction score of 573 for postpaid and 597 for prepaid.\n\n“The findings show that value is the most important driver of the overall experience, followed closely by service quality,” said Carl Lepper, senior director of technology, media and telecom at J.D. Power, in a press release.\n\n“These two dimensions are central to our new model — and for good reason,” he added. “As the market expands with a wide variety of brands designed to meet diverse customer needs, expectations are rising — not just for strong network performance, but also for service plans that reflect individual preferences.”",

    "fullText": "Many school districts across Central Texas have decided to cancel classes amid a winter storm lingering on Monday, January 26. However, a few in the San Antonio area have decided to stay open, leaving parents mixed with support and disapproval.\n\nSome parents are upset with the Poteet Independent School District for keeping its schools open during the Texas winter storm. The district posted its decision on Sunday, January 25, writing that school will resume as normal on Monday. Buses will run at a regular time, according to its Facebook post.\n\nIn the comments, Gloria Fontenot wrote that it's too cold out for her children to go to school. She added that her kids tell her that their buses typically don't have heat on. Teresa Salazar also added that her daughter won't be going to school, as she claims it's always cold in her classroom regardless of the temperature outside. Dale Woods said the decision is \"very sad.\"\n\n\"Be ready for the absences unfortunately,\" Angelica Alderete stated.\n\n\"Yall won't give them off to keep them safe but yall will give them off for a fun weekend of the strawberry festival!!!! Smh,\" Chrussy Perez wrote.\n\nWhile the majority of the comments disagreed with the district, some parents agreed with Poteet ISD. Desiré Guerra thanked the district for the updated and stressed how others need to be mindful that the school may be the only warm place, warm meal that another child may need.\n\n\"Need to send my kids to poteet. No reason to cancel school. Good for you Poteet ISD,\" Anthony Kassin wrote.\n\n\"I'm glad that there is one school that schedule must go on, I'm sure if the weather does get bad they will have an early release but don't look like it, Good job Poteet ISD,\" Zina Gomez added.\n\nCharles Camarillo, the superintendent of Poteet ISD, told MySA the decision to keep the schools open came after having conversations and collaboration with other county districts and knowing that very little to no precipitation is expected.\n\n\"Cold by itself is no reason to close. Second, every parent has the choice to keep their kids at home and can do so without repercussions,\" Camarillo stated via email. \"What about the parents who need them in school or cannot provide care while they are at work. You would think having choices is better than not, and leave the complaining for a better reason.\"\n\nPoteet ISD isn't alone in resuming classes on Monday. Jourdanton ISD and Pleasanton ISD are keeping their schools open on Monday.\n\nThe cities are in Atascosa County, which is under an Extreme Cold Warning until noon on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. The region is expected to have temperatures below 22 degrees around 8 to 9 a.m. on Monday. Temperatures will inch up in the mid-30s around 3 p.m. and then drop again to below freezing by the evening. The NWS says there is refreeze potential on Sunday night, where any liquid or slush remains.\n\nThis article originally published at San Antonio-area school staying open Monday sparks backlash from parents.",

With kickoff set for less than six days, TCU sixth-year senior linebacker Namdi Obiazor has recently accepted an invitation to participate in the annual showcase game. Obiazor, who played in 53 games over four seasons, will join linebacker Kaleb Elarms-Orr, safety Bud Clark and tight end DJ Rogers in the Senior Bowl.\n\nOfficially Accepted!\n\nLB Namdi Obiazor (@namdi4k) from @TCUFootball is headed to the 2026 Panini Senior Bowl 🔥#TheDraftStartsInMobile #WherePlayersPlay pic.twitter.com/wNc4jFWWca\n\n— Panini Senior Bowl (@seniorbowl) January 25, 2026\n\nObiazor, who started his collegiate career at Iowa Western and was a JUCO All-American in 2021, played safety during his first season with the Horned Frogs. Obiazor played in all 15 games and made two starts, finishing with 49 tackles and two pass breakups. Following TCU’s 2022 season, which culminated in a trip to the national title game, Obiazor moved to linebacker and replaced Dee Winters. The change worked well for Obiazor, who earned an All-Big 12 Honorable Mention with 84 tackles, six tackles for loss, four sacks and two pass breakups in 2023.\n\nA three-year starter at TCU, Obiazor ranked second on the team with 81 tackles, third with 6.5 tackles for loss and fifth with 2.5 sacks during the 2024 season. Obiazor would’ve had to turn pro last offseason, but in light of the Diego Pavia lawsuit, which granted additional eligibility to players who started at the JUCO level, Obiazor returned to the Horned Frogs in 2025. In his final season at TCU, Obiazor posted a career-high 88 total tackles along with four tackles for loss, two sacks, two interceptions and a forced fumble. The 6-foot-3, 230-pounder from Eden Prairie, Minnesota was named the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week against Colorado.\n\nThe 2026 Senior Bowl will kick off on Saturday.

    "description": "The Denver Broncos fell to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.",
    "fullText": "Where should the blame go after Broncos drop AFC Championship Game to Patriots? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFollowing a difficult loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday, the Denver Broncos will be wondering how things went so badly. Broncos Country will be pointing fingers in multiple directions.\n\nThe Broncos got up 7-0 in this one and looked to be in control during most of the first half of the game. The biggest play of the game came in the second quarter, when Jarrett Stidham dropped back for a pass and, while facing a fierce New England pass rush, threw a pass with two hands to get rid of the ball.\n\nIt was originally ruled an incomplete pass with an intentional grounding penalty, but the officials quickly changed that, ruling it a backwards pass and recovery by New England. Two plays later, the Patriots scored a touchdown and were on the board, tying the game. In the second half, a grand total of three points were scored... by both teams.\n\nThere were multiple reasons for that, and all of them played a factor in how this game ended up.\n\nThe Broncos' head coach is going to get some heat for this loss due to his play-calling, but his decision to go for it on 4th-and-1 from the New England 14-yard line rather than kicking a field goal will be questioned for quite some time.\n\nIn addition to choosing against taking a chip-shot field goal and taking a 10-0 lead, the play call was poor. Jarrett Stidham dropped back to throw a quick pass to RJ Harvey. It didn't even come close to working. The Broncos turned the ball over on downs and gave away all of the momentum they had earned.\n\nIt turned out to be a critical sequence in this game.\n\nWhen looking back at this game, the majority of Broncos fans are going to put this loss on Stidham and say that with Bo Nix, the Broncos would have won. While that is quite possible, Stidham is not the reason the Broncos lost this game.\n\nTo be clear, he was far from good. But the weather in the second half (more on that later) made it all but impossible to do anything on offense. Stidham threw an interception on what ended up being the Broncos' final possession. That was easily the worst play he made in the game. But he had Courtland Sutton drop two passes and he got little help from his running game. It's hard to put this loss all on his shoulders.\n\nWhat would a loss in today's NFL be without some controversy? Fans of the Buffalo Bills have spent the past week having that discussion, and Broncos fans have some good ammunition to do the same following this game.\n\nThe backwards pass call was highly questionable.\n\nThe refs are at it again\n\nThis was called a backwards pass by Stidham. It’s clearly going forward\n\nThe Broncos just got screwed pic.twitter.com/8OljvmyAgM\n\n— Benchwarmer Sports (@bdubsports_) January 25, 2026\n\nThis was clearly a \"pass\" by Stidham and not a fumble. One angle of the replay shows the ball start to leave Stidham's hands and get deflected by a Patriots defender. What does that result in on any other play? An incomplete pass.\n\nSo in this situation, it truly does not matter where the ball lands in relation to where it was thrown. If it was deflected, it's incomplete. The Patriots go into halftime with no points if not for this play.\n\nOn the opening possession of the second half, the Patriots went for it on 4th-and-1 from the Denver 8-yard line. Drake Maye used a quarterback sneak up the middle and was down right near the line to gain. An overhead replay seemed to show that he came up short, leading to a challenge from Payton. Payton asked for the officials to look at that overhead replay.\n\nIt was extremely close either way, but the referees chose to stick with the call that was made on the field. The Broncos were able to hold to a field goal, but those ended up being the winning points for the Patriots.\n\nWhile many fans are going to passionately criticize Payton and Stidham for this defeat, the snow that began to fall at halftime ended up being the biggest factor in this game.\n\nAfter the initial drive by the Patriots, offensive football was almost non-existent. The footing was terrible for the players and vision was extremely obstructed due to the blizzard-like conditions. This game would have had a much different outcome without the snow and it's an unfortunate turn of events for the Broncos that the weather in their own stadium pretty much ended their hopes of going to the Super Bowl.\n\nFor anyone suggesting that the Patriots had to play in the same conditions, that's not entirely true. If you look at the conditions in the early third quarter compared to how it was just moments after that, it was a drastic change, which is exactly why the score of 10-7 ended up being the final score.\n\nIt was nearly impossible to produce any points once it got like that.\n\nREAD:4 things Denver Broncos must do in order to beat Patriots in AFC Championship Game\n\nThe Broncos had their chances and this was a difficult way to end what was a great season.\n\nBroncos get good news following recent move made by Packers\n\nJarrett Stidham can join exclusive list that includes multiple Hall of Famers\n\n4 under-the-radar factors for Broncos fans to watch for in AFC Championship Game\n\nBroncos' similarities between last Super Bowl appearance and this year are astonishing\n\nFormer coach hated by Broncos fans could play specific role in derailing Super Bowl plans",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are headed to Super Bowl LX after defeating the Denver Broncos by a 10-7 score in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday.\n\nDefense ruled the day in a low-scoring, messy game for both teams. It was tough to move the ball downfield for both offenses with the snow pouring from the sky at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium. The Patriots recorded only 206 total yards of offense, while the Broncos only mustered 181 total yards.\n\nThe rushing attack was a major factor for the Patriots on a day when throwing the ball in the elements proved difficult. They recorded 141 yards on the ground, including a six-yard rushing touchdown from Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.\n\nThe difference in the game ended up being the turnover the Patriots forced on Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham, who fumbled a backwards pass while being hit by linebacker Christian Elliss. That play put the Patriots in the red zone and set up the touchdown run by Maye.\n\nOverall, Maye went 10-of-21 passing for 86 yards, along with rushing 10 times for 65 yards and one touchdown. Rhamondre Stevenson had 25 carries for 71 yards to help punch New England's ticket to the Super Bowl.\n\nHere is how fans reacted on social media to the Patriots' win:\n\nWHAT ARE THEY GONA SAY NOW.

    "fullText": "Braves predicted to sign $200M World Series champion, 2X All-Star to form 'unfair' Chris Sale duo originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are usually known for having one of the top starting rotations in the league. However, after this upcoming season, the picture at the position becomes a major focus. Outside of two Braves starters, there are no pitchers currently under contract beyond that point.\n\n“Beyond Spencer Strider and Spencer Schwellenbach, there are no clear locks for the Atlanta Braves rotation beyond 2026,’” HTHB’s Chase Owens wrote.\n\nThe Braves are content with the starters they have this season, but there comes a point when the future must be considered. Atlanta reportedly checked in on Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta before he was traded. Anthopoulos knows the team needs another starter, but it cannot be just anyone.\n\n“We’ve explored the starting rotation, adding and getting some type of starter, whether that’s trade or signing. We’d like for it to be someone impactful, someone we think can start a playoff game,” Anthopoulos said.\n\nThere is still a name on the market that the Braves could pursue: Framber Valdez. FanSided’s Mark Powell believes Atlanta can get a deal done.\n\n“But Valdez is the best starting pitcher available after Ranger Suarez signed with the Boston Red Sox. His catcher cross-up could cost him some money on what's been a slow market for free-agent starting pitchers. That should only help a team like the Braves, which has an elite rotation (when healthy) but quite frankly needs more bodies. Adding Valdez to a group that already includes Chris Sale, Spencer Strider and Reynaldo Lopez is borderline unfair,” Powell wrote.\n\nThe Braves would benefit greatly from adding Valdez, as it would give the rotation two left-handers and create a nightmare matchup for opposing teams. Atlanta’s rotation is already strong, but this type of move could elevate it to an elite level.\n\nValdez is still chasing another World Series championship, and there may be no better opportunity than joining the team that once defeated the Houston Astros on the game’s biggest stage. Anthopoulos still has room to make another offseason addition as Spring Training approaches.",

Wisconsin was plagued by a 25.7% shooting clip in the second half, which enabled USC to outscore UW 34-30 in the frame en route to the two-point victory.\n\nGreg Gard's group did fare well in the first half with 41 total points, however. Fueled by Boyd, guard John Blackwell and big man Nolan Winter, UW mustered 26 of those points in the final 10 minutes of the first half while overcoming a 10-point deficit.\n\nThe Badgers opened the second frame with a 17-7 scoring burst, but USC countered with a 16-2 run to capture a 62-60 lead with under five minutes to spare. The two teams traded blows down the stretch, but with two ticks to go, Boyd missed an acrobatic layup attempt to tie the game.

    "description": "Here's what coach Shea Ralph said Vanderbilt women's basketball needs to learn the most from its loss to South Carolina.",
    "fullText": "For a team that was undefeated going into its matchup with South Carolina, just about everything went wrong for Vanderbilt women's basketball on Jan. 25 at Colonial Life Arena.\n\nOn offense, the No. 4 Commodores committed 20 turnovers. On defense, they allowed South Carolina to shoot 62% from the field (40-for-65).\n\nDuring one sequence at the beginning of the third quarter, they cut their deficit to seven, but they missed a few layups and from there, the No. 2 Gamecocks took control.\n\n\"As crappy as we played today for a lot of that game, especially in the second quarter, in the beginning of the third we were in it,\" Vanderbilt coach Shea Ralph said. \"We can never let the wind go out of our sails. We can never lay down and die. And I think for me, that was what was most disappointing and embarrassing. We just didn't play like ourselves, and at points in the game, it was like we quit.\"\n\nRalph did compliment Mikayla Blakes on her hustle, as the star sophomore put up 23 points, seven rebounds, five assists and three steals.\n\nThe most disappointing element to Ralph, though, was Vanderbilt's defense. Though some of the issue was the Commodores (20-1, 6-1 SEC) allowing 32 points off their 20 turnovers, the Gamecocks (20-2, 6-1) had 10 made 3's, shooting 59%.\n\n\"Our defense, was bad today, awful,\" Ralph said. \"We can score, we'll be fine. We scored 74 points. We turned the ball over 20 times, even if we turned it over 10 times and scored on the other 10 possessions, we would've scored 100 points almost. We can't just give people the ball, but we were still able to score. They didn't hold us scoreless. We just couldn't defend them. So you can't do both, you can't give them the ball and then not guard them. That is a recipe for absolute disaster.\"\n\nVanderbilt must bounce back fast before its matchup at Ole Miss on Jan. 29 (6:30 p.m. CT, SECN+). Ralph said that it's unlikely the Commodores will return to Nashville before heading to Oxford, Mississippi. Both locations were hit hard by the winter storm that has swept through nearly half the nation, bringing ice damage and power outages.\n\nUltimately, Ralph believes that playing in the hostile environment of Colonial Life Arena will be beneficial.\n\n\"This is a really tough environment to prepare for,\" she said. \"This is why I beg and plead for people to show up to our games, because we want to have a home environment like South Carolina has for our kids . . . The only way you prepare for it, I think, is by having one or continuing to have experience playing in one. A lot of my kids that played a lot of big minutes today haven't done that in this kind of environment.\n\n\" . . . I'm looking at myself even more than I'm looking at our players. How do we prepare them better? How do we help them more so that they can execute better in a game like this, when a team is firing on all cylinders at home? Absolutely, we've got to figure that out as a coaching staff. And then sometimes I know, as a player, you've just got to go through it to learn this. This was a really hard lesson to learn today. This was not fun. But I know my team, I know my staff, I know we are just fine.\"\n\nAria Gerson covers Vanderbilt athletics for The Tennessean.

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers could be seeing the return of one of their key bench players. Sam Merrill, who has missed the team’s last five games with a right-hand sprain, is listed as questionable for Monday’s game against the Orlando Magic.\n\nMerrill has been dealing with a hand sprain for much of the season. He injured it originally in a November win against the Milwaukee Bucks. This resulted in him missing just over a month of games. When he did return to the lineup, he wasn’t pain-free, as head coach Kenny Atkinson said at the time that he couldn’t even shake Merrill’s hand after games due to the pain he was in.\n\nMerrill injured his hand again in the team’s Jan. 14 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. That’s the same game in which Darius Garland injured his other toe.\n\nAnything bought from the links helps support Fear the Sword. You can also shop all of Homage’s Cavs gear HERE. The link to the new City Edition shirt can be found HERE.\n\nWe don’t have any further updates on Garland’s injury beyond what the team released last Sunday. The Cavs said that Garland would be reevaluated in seven to 10 days after suffering a Grade 1 right great toe sprain. That initial timeframe would put the reevaluation happening anytime between now and Wednesday.\n\nEven though the Cavs won’t be fully healthy for their game against the Magic, it would be beneficial to possibly get Merrill back in the lineup. Merrill has the third-best on/off differential on the team this season (+4.7 points per 100 possessions, 75th percentile). They’re 16-8 in the games he’s played.\n\nOn the season, Merrill is averaging 13.8 points on .470/.455/.882 shooting splits.\n\nThe Magic will once again be without their leading scorer, Franz Wagner (ankle), in Monday’s rematch.",

    "description": "The Cleveland Guardians had a clear reason for addressing the bullpen over the offseason.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Guardians were fairly active addressing one of the areas of their roster this offseason, even though it wasn’t the position group fans were hoping the team would spend some money on: the bullpen.\n\nChris Anonetti recently spoke about why Cleveland felt they needed to add more depth to the bullpen, and a little bit about the pitchers they brought in.\n\n\"We lost a couple of pitchers last year to some unfortunate circumstances, and then we had a couple of guys become free agents. So this was an area that we felt we wanted to try to supplement,” explained Antonetti (quote via Mason Horodyski of WEWS).\n\n“The group, by and large, did a really good job last year, but we didn't want to rest on that. We wanted to try to add some options, because we know it's an area that will be tested over the course of the season. We don't, we're going to need far more than just eight relievers to start the season with. We're gonna need to be 13, 14, 15, or more deep.”\n\nCleveland, as a group, had a reliever ERA of 3.44, which ranked third in MLB, and a WHIP of 1.23, which ranked third in the American League.\n\nHowever, as Antonetti noted, the Guardians will very likely be without Emmanuel Clase moving forward, and Jakob Junis, Nic Enright, Sam Hentges, Kolby Allard, and Zak Kent are off to their next team, leaving plenty of innings for the team to fill.\n\nThe Guardians did need to add some more arms to the reliever core, and to the front office’s credit, they do do just that by adding Shawn Armstrong, Colin Holderman, Connor Brogdon, and Rule 5 selected Payton Pallette.\n\nIt remains to be seen exactly how all of these pieces fit together, but the Guardians have certainly given Stephen Vogt and the rest of the staff options to go to througohut the season.\n\nThere will definitely be a nice competition throughout spring training to see which arms start on the big-league roster, who will begin at Triple-A, and which pitchers may not have a role with the Guardians in 2026.\n\nGuardians Roundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

Vrabel will be the second person ever to coach and play in a Super Bowl for the same team.\n\nVrabel joins Gary Kubiak as the only coach who has reached a Super Bowl with the same team as both a coach and a player. If the Patriots win the Super Bowl, Vrabel will be the first person in history to win a Super Bowl as a coach and player for the same franchise.\n\nTom Flores, Mike Ditka, Tony Dungy and Doug Pederson are the only people to win a Super Bowl as both a player and a coach, but none did so with the same team. Vrabel won three Super Bowls as a player, and in his first year as a head coach with the Patriots, he has taken them to the Super Bowl.\n\nVrabel is the eighth coach in history to lead a team to the Super Bowl in his first year with the team. He joins Kubiak, Jim Caldwell, Jon Gruden, Bill Callahan, George Seifert, Red Miller and Don McCafferty.\n\nThe Patriots were 4-13 last season, and in Vrabel’s first season, they went 14-3, won the AFC East and clinched the No. 2 seed in the AFC. It is the Patriots’ first Super Bowl appearance since the 2018 season, when they defeated the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nVrabel is a finalist for Coach of the Year.

    "fullText": "Vincent Kompany is still learning on his job.\n\nThe 39-year-old, now in his second season at Bayern Munich, is still in the early part of his managerial career, which began only in 2020. In that time he’s overseen highs and lows, having both taken Burnley to promotion and suffering relegation from the Premier League.\n\n“I don’t think that winning titles makes you a good coach, or getting relegated makes you a bad one,” Kompany reflected in remarks captured by @iMiaSanMia. “A good coach is someone who learns something new every year, regardless of whether we win or lose.\n\n“We’re in a good position right now; it’s all about the details. We simply want to be competitive. We want to prepare well for the matches where trophies are at stake, where it’s about going through or being eliminated. In those moments, we have to have the big players fit because they’re the ones who decide the games for us.”\n\nWhat else is there to say? You have to love Kompany’s mindset. It is no surprise, given who he is and how he approaches his work, that he has found success at Bayern. Now the club is reflecting these attitudes in just about every way: every day, a little step forward.\n\nAnd this year? The stars seem to be lining up for the Bavarians. It would be a surprise to see them not go far in the Champions League.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings play five times in the final week of fantasy hockey before a lengthy matchup that starts before the NHL's Olympic break and ends after it.",
    "fullText": "While the Olympic break obviously makes NHL scheduling a lot more difficult, it is curious that Week 17 of the fantasy hockey season ends on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nIt's a standard seven-day week, but that means Week 18 will run from Monday, Feb. 2 to Sunday, March 1, putting the Olympics right in the middle of the matchup.\n\nWould it not have made more sense for the Olympic break to be the cut-off between Weeks 17 and 18, and run Week 17 from Monday, Jan. 26 to Thursday, Feb. 5 (11 days) and then Week 18 from Wednesday, Feb. 25 to Sunday, March 8 (12 days)? Anyway, I digress.\n\n(Week 18's primer will likely be split into two parts, one for Feb. 2 to 5, and then an update for Feb. 25 to March 8).\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings are the highlight in Week 17 with a league-high five games, though they're all on the road with two back-to-backs. The matchups are not easy, and with Sunday in Carolina being their fifth game in seven days – that one seems like a scheduled loss.\n\nThere are seven teams – the Islanders, Bruins, Golden Knights, Blue Jackets, Flyers, Mammoth and Rangers – that play four times, including a back-to-back, home-and-home series between the Isles and Rangers. That's a matchup where targeting Isles would be beneficial. Bo Horvat is back in the lineup and providing a more balanced offense, and the Rangers are completely lost in net without Igor Shesterkin.\n\nIt's a very heavy Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday schedule, so plan accordingly, as there's only one game on Friday and three games on Sunday, leaving little wiggle room if you're far behind entering Saturday's games.\n\nAll positions and rostered percentages are courtesy of Yahoo Fantasy.\n\nPick players from teams at the top of the schedule matrix to maximize games and matchups. Green is good. Red is bad. Points percentages are as of Sunday morning.\n\nFantilli's fantasy value this season has oscillated from potential breakout star to occasional streamer with occasional hot streaks. Note, however, Fantilli's seen increased ice time under Rick Bowness, and he's responded accordingly with plenty of shots, hits and faceoff wins. With increased ice time, the offensive production should come. So far, Fantilli has been underwhelming, and if there's a stat that might point toward a turnaround under Bowness, it's his curiously low 9.3 shooting percentage.\n\nKent Johnson was the flavor of the week last week, but the spike in ice time was likely Bowness trying to see what Johnson can do, and the 11:15 of ice time versys Dallas and 13:12 versus Tampa is evidence Bowness wasn't impressed.\n\nNHL Power Rankings: Each Team's Biggest Trade Bait Will there be more trades before the Olympic break? The action's already heating up as we look at one player per team who could be traded in this week's NHL power rankings.\n\nCirelli has two goals and six points in his past three games, taking over L1 from the injured Brayden Point and Nick Paul dropping down to L4. Dominic James gets L2 with Jake Guentzel, but Cirelli is the safer option. The Lightning can change up their lines at any moment – their blueline is decimated once again with Erik Cernak injured – but Cirelli's the most logical player to target for L1/PP2 upside on an excellent team.\n\nAlex Lyon's 26-save shutout against the Isles gives me pause on holding Luukkonen all season because it gives the Sabres a legitimate case for all three of their goalies to see increased playing time. Remember, too, it was difficult for Luukkonen to get into a rhythm when he played so sparingly upon returning from injury.\n\nWith no back-to-backs and only three games in Week 17, it's very probable Luukkonen only sees action once, with Luukkonen, Lyon and Colten Ellis each getting a start. It's not ideal, but the difference between this season and last season is that the Sabres are legitimately good, so it's still worth holding onto Luukkonen just in case he performs the best and gets an extra start or two.\n\nIt was too quick to proclaim Montembeault's return as the No. 1. After a string of five games where he only lost once, Montembeault has allowed seven goals in his two most recent games, both of which were losses. The reprieve for Montembeault is that only three of the goals allowed were at even strength (though one was shorthanded), but it opens the door again for Jakub Dobes to get more playing time. Really tough schedule for the Habs in Week 17 with the Knights and Avalanche at home and then a road date in Buffalo.\n\nConsidering Adin Hill hasn't exactly been sharp since his return, Schmid still holds plenty of fantasy value as they continue to alternate starts. Long-term, Hill is still the play, but Schmid has generally been quite good this season – 15 wins in 22 starts but a pedestrian .896 SP – and will continue to win games, especially since the Knights are expected to load up ahead of the trade deadline, even after acquiring Rasmus Andersson.\n\nOlofsson scored three points in three games entering Sunday's game against the Leafs, and he has seen his ice time spike to over 20 minutes per game following a promotion to L1 and PP1 with Nathan MacKinnon. (He came skated about 18 minutes on Sunday against the Leafs). He's an excellent shooter but is prone to streaks and inconsistent play, but as long as he's in this role, there's some under-the-radar fantasy value. Olofsson provides good shot volume as long as he gets the ice time, with a pretty good conversion rate at a 13.2 shooting percentage, though he tends to be most effective on the power play.\n\nKasper's had a tough season, but his potential is evident, and that's one reason why the Wings have kept him in the lineup virtually all season. (He was scratched for one game in late December, with Mason Appleton returning from injury).\n\nThat patience seems to be paying off; Kasper has two goals and six points in his past five games, with his ice time spiking to 17:29 in a tough matchup in Minnesota. His production was bound to spike if you consider his unsustainably low 6.3 shooting percentage – he shot 13.1 percent last season – and it's always a good sign that a player has confidence when he elects to shoot on a 2-on-1 rush, as he did Saturday against the Jets.\n\nIt might take Chytil some time to find his rhythm – he narrowly missed an excellent opportunity to convert a goal in his first game back against the Devils on Friday – but still finished the game with 18:29 of ice time, eight faceoff wins, two shots and a hit. Injury risk is always a concern, but the Canucks desperately needed his presence down the middle, and he offers L2 and PP2 upside.\n\nChytil's 50-point upside and solid shooting volume – at least two shots per game – make him one of the more worthwhile gambles off the waiver wire at this point in the season, even at a pretty deep position.\n\nShayne Gostisbehere is battling a groin issue – again – which puts Walker on PP1. The Canes are hoping Gostisbehere returns before the Olympic break, but if he doesn't, Walker's fantasy value spikes with the new role. Walker obviously doesn't have as much offensive upside as Gostisbehere, and Alexander Nikishin and K'Andre Miller could both challenge for some PP1 minutes (they're on PP2 right now), but Walker can still provide a high floor with hits and blocks. In deeper leagues where defense is thin, Walker is a low-risk pickup with upside.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley took 6-6 center Madina Okot out of the starting lineup and went with four guards. Here's why.",
    "fullText": "COLUMBIA — Fresh off the first SEC loss of the season, South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley took Madina Okot out of the starting lineup.\n\nThe 6-6 center still scored 17 points in the 103-74 win over No. 4 Vanderbilt on Jan. 25.\n\n\"Madina is not the scapegoat at all,\" Staley said. \"It was totally giving her a look at the game. Just take a little bit of pressure off of her, because we're putting her in situations that we have had (previous) players build to those moments.\"\n\nFreshman Agot Makeer started in Okot's place for South Carolina for a four-guard lineup. Okot was 8-of-9 from the floor with seven rebounds and five steals, a game after she had six points in the loss to No. 16 Oklahoma on Jan. 22.\n\nStaley said legendary South Carolina players like A'ja Wilson and Aaliyah Boston didn't have to dominate as freshmen or in Okot's case, in their first year with the team after transferring. Okot started for Mississippi State last year but the expectations differed.\n\n\"I know she felt better that she wasn't in at the beginning of the game, she could see how they were playing, what they might do, get her mind ready to play,\" Staley said. \"Sometimes that's all some players need is a different look at it.\"\n\nWilson started in her first exhibition game as a freshman in 2014 but then didn't start in a real game until her sophomore year.\n\n\"The entire crowd anticipated (Wilson) coming in and just doing all the things that she would she would normally do if she was a starter,\" Staley said. \"We just kind of took a page out of that book to make sure Madina gives us something.\"\n\nOkot was 3-of-9 from the floor against Oklahoma, and had just four rebounds with three turnovers.\n\nOkot checked in with 5:23 left in the first quarter then got a steal less than 20 seconds later. She dribbled down the court as two Vanderbilt guards caught up with her and kicked back out to Ta'Niya Latson at the 3-point line. Latson gave Okot the ball back inside and she made the layup through contact.\n\n\"Madina played extremely well,\" Latson said. \"She went out there and she got back to herself.\"\n\nLatson's short jumper with 1:30 left in the first quarter rolled out and Okot caught the rebound, kept it high in her hands and got the putback layup plus the foul.\n\n\"I feel like it was a different presence for (Okot) out there,\" said guard Tessa Johnson. \"That's the Madina that we've been missing, and I think she really picked it up. It was good for her and the team.\"\n\nLulu Kesin covers South Carolina athletics for The Greenville News and the USA TODAY Network. Email her at LKesin@usatodayco.com.

I did a good job of staying patient and executing when I needed to.\"\n\nScheffler, who hasn't missed a cut on the PGA Tour since August 2022, started the day one off the lead and opened with a birdie. He bogeyed the second before settling in with back-to-back birdies at four and five and another pair at seven and eight.\n\nHe added four more birdies coming in, his four-footer at the par-five 16th pushing him to 29-under.\n\nHe was in the water off the tee on the way to a double-bogey at the par-three 17th, but by then there was no catching him.\n\nOvernight leader Kim Si-woo of South Korea carded an even par 72 to tie for sixth on 22-under.\n\nTeenager Blades Brown, who started the day tied with Scheffler on 21-under, closed with a two-over 74 for a share of 18th.\n\nIt finished off a remarkable week for the 18-year-old from Tennessee, who tied for 17th in a Korn Ferry event in the Bahamas on Wednesday before a dash to California to tee it up on a sponsor's exemption.\n\nHe flirted with a 59 on Friday, when a 60 gave him a share of the halfway lead. He had a birdie chance at 18 for a share of 10th -- and a place in the Torrey Pines field.\n\nHe closed with a bogey but departed happy with his week.\n\n\"I could probably write a book about what I've learned these past couple of days,\" Brown said.\n\n\"Just knowing that I can compete out here. It was so cool watching Scottie win in person and getting to play with him.\n\n\"He's such an unbelievable guy. He talked to me numerous times throughout the round and was giving me a lot of encouragement, so it was awesome.\"",

    "fullText": "After the biggest game of the season, the Vegas Golden Knights subsequently put together their worst outing.\n\nOn Sunday, the Ottawa Senators embraced the NFL spirit and put up a touchdown and extra point on the Golden Knights, defeating them 7-1.\n\nDespite Mitch Marner getting a penalty shot early on, it was the Senators having more jump in the first period. It eventually paid off with Fabian Zetterlund firing a puck off of Kaedan Korczak behind the net to beat Adin Hill to get Ottawa off to a 1-0 start.\n\nThe second period would see the Senators take advantage after the Golden Knights missed an opportunity on a 5-on-3 power play. Dylan Cozens would make good on a scoring chance with Hill well out of position to double the Ottawa lead. 18 seconds later, Jordan Spence would beat Hill clean from the point to add to the punishment.\n\nAnother mistake allowed Stephen Halliday to push the lead to four goals, and the Golden Knights were in deep trouble.\n\nThe third period would start with Cozens and Halliday’s second goals of the game getting past Hill just over two minutes in. Former Golden Knight Nick Cousins would finish the job with the seventh Ottawa goal.\n\nIt would not be all bad for the Golden Knights, with Rasmus Andersson scoring his first goal in a Golden Knights jersey, but it was far too little, far too late.\n\nThe Andersson goal prevented the worst loss in Golden Knights franchise history. They have lost by six goals only three other times prior to tonight.\n\nThe Golden Knights will hope to rebound quickly from this embarrassment when they head to Quebec to face the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Chris Finch's voice cracked and faltered as the coach expressed on behalf of the Minnesota Timberwolves their heartbreak for the community's collective fear and pain from the ongoing immigration crackdown, following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a federal officer.\n\nFinch presents a straightforward, no-nonsense approach in his public statements and rarely reveals much emotion, but he was clearly moved by the situation in Minneapolis before his team hosted Golden State on Sunday. The game between the Timberwolves and Warriors was postponed by 24 hours, after Pretti was killed on Saturday.\n\n“I’m more than a resident. This is my home. I love living here. I love being a part of this community. I’ve been embraced from day one. People have been amazing. It’s sad to watch what is happening,” said Finch, who was hired by the Timberwolves five years ago. “On the human level, certainly as somebody who takes great pride in being here, I know a lot of our players feel the same. They all love being here, and it’s just hard to watch what we’re going through.”\n\nThe Timberwolves held a moment of silence for Pretti prior to the national anthem, just as they did for Renee Good before their game on Jan. 8, the day after she was fatally shot by a federal officer. The Trump administration in December launched what the Department of Homeland Security declared the largest immigration enforcement operation in history and earlier this month announced a surge of more officers to push their force past 2,000.\n\nThe NBA announced Saturday that the rescheduling decision was made to “prioritize the safety and security of the Minneapolis community” after Pretti was killed during a confrontation in a commercial district less than 2 miles south of Target Center. Finch said on Sunday that the Timberwolves pushed for the postponement to respect the public grieving process.\n\n“Playing basketball just didn't feel like the right thing to do,” Finch said, thanking the NBA and the Warriors for their support.\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr, long one of the league's most outspoken coaches, was measured but clearly moved as he expressed his own sympathy.\n\n“This has always been a great stop on the NBA tour. I love the city of Minneapolis. People here are wonderful, and it’s very sad what’s happening. I feel for the city. There’s a pall that’s been cast over the city. You can feel it. A lot of people are suffering, and obviously a loss of life is the number one concern. Those families will never get their family members back,” Kerr said.\n\nTens of thousands of people swarmed downtown Minneapolis on Friday in protest of the tactics and presence of immigration officers, a crowd the Warriors could see from their hotel as it moved toward Target Center. A smaller protest march took place downtown before the game Sunday.\n\nThere were plenty of other voices being raised around the sports world on Sunday. Women's basketball star Breanna Stewart held a sign with \"abolish ICE\" printed on it during introductions at her Unrivaled league game. Minnesota Frost fans during a PWHL game chanted “Ice out now!” The NBA Players Association issued a statement in support of the protests in Minnesota and urged its members to speak up.\n\nThe perspectives in a polarized country vary wildly on what constitutes constitutionally protected protesting and what becomes violent political disruption, and Kerr seemed to sense that tension as he spoke before the game on Sunday.\n\n“People are so angry. There should be an appeal to our better angels to look after one another and to recognize what’s happening. We’re being divided by media for profit, by misinformation. There’s so much out there that is really difficult for all of us to sort of reconcile,” Kerr said. “And so in times like these you have to lean on values and who you are and who you want to be, either as an individual or a country.”\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Replay currently can be used to undo an erroneous facemask call. Why shouldn't it be used when a clear and obvious foul was missed?\n\nIt happened during the second quarter of Sunday's NFC Championship, when Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford had his facemask grabbed on a third-down sack that forced a field goal. If the penalty hadn't been missed, the Rams would have gotten 15 yards and a fresh set of downs.\n\nSome would say the NFL resists using replay to put a flag on the field. From its inception, however, the current replay rules have allowed a penalty to be called for having too many men on the field.\n\nToday, too many things are reviewable to justify omitting something that requires no subjectivity. And it's eventually going to affect a huge game, in a huge spot.\n\nIt affected today's huge NFC Championship, ending a potential touchdown drive that could have tied the game at 10 and forcing the Rams to settle for three.

While there are some notable NFL-wifes with high profiles like Taylor Swift and Hailee Steinfeld, Ann Michael is a hometown fixture who has been with Maye dating back to their childhood.\n\nTheir relationship that began in a North Carolina middle school when they were just 12 years old.

    "fullText": "Jose Ramirez is going to make history for the Cleveland Guardians originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians have secured their leading man, as Jose Ramirez has agreed to a new extension that will keep him in Cleveland until his age 39 season. The Guards are giving Ramirez a raise of sorts, with the long-time third baseman agreeing to terms on a seven-year, $175 contract extension that runs through 2032. Ramirez had three years and $69 million left on his current deal, so this new deal will see him get a bump while adding four more years to his current deal.\n\nThe extension also all but guarantees Ramirez the ability to finish his career with the Guardians and as Cleveland's all-time leader in multiple categories. Thus cementing him as the de facto all-time face of the franchise.\n\nAssuming he can stay healthy for most of the deal, he's looking at taking the top spot in numerous categories, including, but not limited to;\n\nOffensive WAR (Currently 3rd and 16.8 points behind Tris Speaker)\n\nGames Played (Currently 3rd and just 10 games off of first place, Terry Turner)\n\nAt-Bats (Currently 2nd and just 65 at-bats off of first-place Nap Lajoie)\n\nRuns Scored (Currently 3rd and 153 runs off of first-place Earl Averill)\n\nHits (Currently 7th and sits 379 hits off of Lajoie)\n\nTotal Bases (Currently 2nd and sits 193 off of Averill)\n\nDoubles (Currently 3rd and is 88 off of Speaker)\n\nHome Runs (Currently 2nd and is 52 off of Jim Thome)\n\nRBIs (Currently 2nd and is 135 off of Averill)\n\nBase on Balls (Currently 9th and is342 off of Thome)\n\nStolen Bases (Currently 2nd and is 165 off of Kenny Lofton).\n\nMost of these records will fall in the next few years, but some could take four or five at his current rate of production. He's alreadyat the top of some categories, which include;\n\nIt's pretty remarkable to see just how dominant he's been and how loyal he's been. Yet, there's also a sharp critique of the MLB in there, too. The Guardians and MLB's inability to keep players in smaller markets is the reason why this feat is not only so rare but even possible for Ramirez. With some of the biggest names in the game's history having played significant time in the city, you'd think it'd be nearly impossible for Ramirez to land atop some 15 categories. Especially ones where player skillsets don't normally overlap (home runs and stolen bases, for instance).\n\nWith teams like the LA Dodgers paying more on their luxury tax bill than the Guardians will spend on their payroll, it's becoming rarer and rarer for teams like the Guardians to keep their players, but this isn't a new issue.\n\nTeams like the Philadelphia Phillies, Boston Red Sox nd New York Yankees have historically overpaid for players, especially Cleveland's. If it weren't for the wealth discrepancy in the Major Leagues, guys like Thome, Manny Ramirez, and C.C. Sabathia may have never left Cleveland.\n\nIf that's the case, who knows if Ramirez even gets close to some of these records? Guys like Thome and Ramirez raked the ball as well as anyone historically, and each finished with Hall of Fame-worthy numbers. It would've been nearly impossible for Ramirez to take as many top spots as he's about to if some guys didn't leave due to better contracts.\n\nThat said, they did leave, and now Ramirez has the chance to cement his name all over the Cleveland history books. Which should give fans of the Guards something to hang their hat on at least.",

Tackle Garett Bolles and guard Quinn Meinerz both earned First-Team All-Pro selections, and the return of center Luke Wattenberg was expected to solidify the unit on Sunday.\n\nDenver allowed two fewer sacks than New England, but Williams and the Patriots had the last laugh after shutting the Broncos out in the second half to capture an AFC championship on the road.\n\nEarlier in the week, Williams rubbed some Broncos fans the wrong way when he was asked what he knew about Stidham.\n\n\"I ain't gonna lie, nothing. We're gonna watch the tape on him and figure out what he like to do. But no. They didn't like him over the Bo, so,\" Williams said.\n\nSome interpreted Williams' response as simple honesty, as the Patriots had never had a reason to prepare for Stidham before Nix's injury, but others saw the comment as an underestimation of the Broncos' backup quarterback.\n\nIf Denver interpreted Williams' remarks as bulletin board material, it didn't make much of a difference in the end.\n\nBest pictures in the snow from Patriots' win in Denver blizzard\n\n3 Sean Payton calls that came back to bite Broncos\n\nHow weather negatively impacted AFC championship game\n\nPatriots take advantage of controversial Drake Maye 'tush push' play",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles have a very exciting young baseball team, but last season they played far worse than expected, which led to Brandon Hyde being fired early on. During the managerial search for the right fit, the position was an attractive one given the talent on the roster. Ultimately, the Orioles decided to hire Craig Albernaz.\n\n“The Orioles’ search for a new manager is over. Baltimore has hired Cleveland associate manager Craig Albernaz to become its skipper, the club announced Monday,” MLB.com’s Jake Rill wrote.\n\nThe Orioles have had a huge offseason so far, even though most of their moves came at the start of free agency. Acquiring Pete Alonso was a major coup, alongside several other additions. With some names still left on the market, Baltimore could also pursue Framber Valdez.\n\n“Baltimore has already committed $195 million to four free agents -- Pete Alonso, Ryan Helsley, Zach Eflin and Leody Taveras -- ranking sixth in spending thus far. But general manager Mike Elias, entering the final year of his contract, has one more haymaker left: Framber Valdez. With Ranger Suárez landing $130 million over five years in Boston, Valdez projects to get around six years and $180 million -- a deal that would vault the O's past the Dodgers and Blue Jays as baseball's top free agent spenders,” ESPN’s Paul Hembekides wrote.\n\nAdding Valdez would be huge for the Orioles, bolstering their rotation significantly. Part of the reason his free-agent market has dragged on is the controversy over a questionable pitch-crossing incident.\n\n“Both Framber Valdez and César Salazar were brought into the manager’s office after the game. Valdez is said to have apologized to Salazar but said the cross-up was not on purpose,” JomBoy Media wrote.\n\nIf the cross-up wasn’t intentional, then Valdez has no character concerns, allowing the Orioles to pursue the World Series–winning lefty without hesitation. Baltimore is eager to return to the playoffs after their 100-win season just a couple of years ago.\n\nValdez would likely play a major role in that push, as the Orioles aim to rebound after a disappointing 2025. While only time will tell, this move would help Baltimore compete in a stacked AL East.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills became the tenth team to fire their head coach in the 2025-2026 season as they parted ways with Sean McDermott. He was hired ahead of the 2017 season and amassed a 98-50 regular-season record.\n\nMcDermott was let go after another early playoff exit. He went 8-8 in the postseason and never won in the AFC Championship Game to make the Super Bowl.\n\nThis puts some pressure on the possible head coaching candidate for the Bills. McDermott won the AFC East five of the last six seasons. Buffalo believes it is in win-now mode, and the new head coach will be expected to hit the ground running and may not have a year or two to ease into the gig. This suggests that the Bills will target experienced head coaches, which makes the hiring process all the more interesting.\n\nHere are the latest rumors on Buffalo's coaching search.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best Bills coaching candidates to replace Sean McDermott\n\nBills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, also a top candidate for a promotion to head coach in Buffalo, is in Las Vegas on Sunday for a second interview for the Raiders' head coaching job, per Schefter.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Buffalo completed an interview with the Jaguars' offensive coordinator Grant Udinski. Udinski is a fast-rising 30-year-old assistant who has already garnered significant interest from other teams, including the Cleveland Browns.\n\nRapoport reports that former quarterback Philip Rivers is under \"serious consideration\" for the Buffalo Bills' head coaching vacancy after an impressive in-person interview. Despite Rivers having only high school coaching experience, his strong relationship with Josh Allen and his reputation as a charismatic leader have made him a legitimate candidate to replace Sean McDermott.\n\nThe Bills have interviewed former quarterbacks Philip Rivers and Davis Webb for their open head coaching position. Both of them, as well as current quarterback Josh Allen, share the same agent.\n\nBuffalo fielded an interview with Miami defensive coordinator  Anthony Weaver on Saturday. The former Ravens and Texans defensive end has been a hot name in the coaching carousel in recent years, also drawing interest from the Ravens and Steelers in their head-coaching searches.\n\nFormer Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel has already accepted a job as the Los Angeles Chargers' new offensive coordinator, though the contract remains unsigned. This was more of a backup plan for him, as he is still eligible to interview for head coaching roles. McDaniel was expected to interview with the Browns and the Bills last week but backed out of both.\n\nMcDaniel was scheduled to meet with the Bills on Friday, January 23.\n\nRivers came out of retirement to play for the Indianapolis Colts at the end of the year, and he did say he might be interested in coaching once he retires for good. Rivers has experience coaching high school football, but none at the pro level.\n\nWe have completed an interview with Philip Rivers for our head coaching position.\n\n— Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) January 23, 2026\n\nLynn will interview on Saturday as part of a busy weekend for the Bills interview team, as all these interviews will take place in Florida. The former Los Angeles Chargers coach spent a few seasons in Buffalo as an assistant coach under Rex Ryan, and even coached one game as an interim head coach.\n\nMcDaniel agreed to take the Los Angeles Chargers offensive coordinator job, but that is only if he doesn'd land a head coaching opportunity. The former Miami Dolphins head coach played the Bills twice a season in the AFC East for the last four years.\n\nNext up on the Bills interview list is Brian Daboll. The 50-year-old was Buffalo's offensive coordinator from 2018-21, parlaying his success with the Josh Allen-attack into a head-coaching gig with the Giants. Per Russini, Daboll's covets the Bills position. He'll get his first chance to push for the role on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to the media alongside owner Terry Pegula, Bills GM Brandon Beane said Wednesday that the team will conduct \"100 percent an open search,\" with Josh Allen expected to have input. Beane says the list of candidates the Bills plan to interview includes coaches still coaching in the playoffs.\n\nThe Bills' fifth and sixth interview requests went out to Jaguars OC Grant Udinski and Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver. Udinski, who would be the youngest head coach in NFL history if hired, has a second interview lined up with the Browns, while Weaver is a candidate for the Ravens and Steelers jobs.\n\nThe first defensive-minded candidate for the Bills is Colts DC Lou Anarumo, who has never been an NFL head coach but has drawn interest for his work between Cincinnati and Indianapolis. Anarumo is the fourth known head coaching candidate for the Bills.\n\nThe Bills will interview Anthony Lynn, Brian Daboll, and Joe Brady for their head coaching job, making that trio the first three confirmed candidates.\n\nLynn, formerly the head coach of the Chargers and once a Bills assistant, is currently the Commanders’ running game coordinator, while Brady is the Bills’ offensive coordinator and Daboll held that role from 2018-21 before becoming the Giants’ head coach.\n\nDaboll is likely going to be a coaching candidate for the open job in Buffalo. Despite what happened during his tenure with the New York Giants, he did serve as the Bills' offensive coordinator from 2018 to 2021. This coincided with the first four seasons of Allen's career, so Daboll helped provide a foundation for the quarterback.\n\nIn the four seasons with Daboll as the OC, Allen played in 61 games and had 14,114 passing yards with 100 touchdowns and 46 interceptions. He added 2,325 rushing yards with 31 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nThe quarterback has played in 67 games without Daboll as his OC. In that span, he has 15,988 yards with 117 touchdowns and 48 interceptions. Allen has 2,396 rushing yards with 48 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nMORE: What's next for Sean McDermott?\n\nBrady is the current offensive coordinator for the Bills. He would help to provide consistency in the organization, but Buffalo would have to decide if it trusts that the OC has something in him to get past the postseason hump that plagued McDermott's tenure.\n\nHe served as the quarterbacks coach in 2022 and 2023 before being promoted to interim offensive coordinator in 2023. He was made the permanent offensive coordinator in 2024, coincidentally the year that Allen won his first MVP Award.\n\nMORE: Why did the Bills fire Sean McDermott?\n\nIn the two full seasons with Brady as the OC, Allen has played in 34 games and had 7,399 yards with 53 touchdowns and 16 interceptions with an additional 1,110 yards and 26 touchdowns on the ground.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots have spent the last season engineering a remarkable turnaround, and on Sunday, they stunned the NFL by completing their journey back to the Super Bowl with an AFC Championship win over the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Patriots captured a 10-7 win over the Broncos in a defensive struggle that turned out to be the second consecutive snow game for New England. And despite the challenging wintry environment and natural atmospheric challenges that accompany a trip to Empower Field at Mile High, the Patriots took care of business for their 17th victory of the season, returning to the Super Bowl for the first time since capturing Super Bowl LIII at the close of the 2018 season.\n\nThe Super Bowl appearance for the Patriots puts the cherry on top of a remarkable season that has gone better for the organization than any of their fans – or really anyone who follows the league – could have imagined. The Patriots are coming off back-to-back four-win seasons and are in their first season under the leadership of head coach Mike Vrabel, who previously captured three Super Bowls as a player with the franchise.\n\nThe Patriots will face the winner of the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, as the NFC West Divisional Rivals battle in a rubber match on Sunday night in the NFC Championship Game after splitting their first two games of the year. Check out some of the reactions to their dramatic turnaround below.\n\nAfter two straight seasons of going 4-13, who would’ve thought? pic.twitter.com/zrgyVaOGul\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 25, 2026\n\nTHE THRONE IS RECLAIMED 👑 \n\nNew England is AFC royalty again, headed to the Super Bowl for the first time since Super Bowl LIII. pic.twitter.com/fDhN7caIiK\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 25, 2026\n\nFrom 4-13 to Super Bowl bound.\n\nMike Vrabel is one hell of a coach. pic.twitter.com/11xvGOJjo9\n\n— JPA (@jasrifootball) January 25, 2026\n\nWith Sunday’s AFC-clinching victory, the Patriots have now won 17 games this season.\n\nThey won 16 games over the previous three seasons combined. pic.twitter.com/VHU3jeITaG\n\n— Dianna Russini (@DMRussini) January 25, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Internet reacts as Patriots cap stunning season with Super Bowl trip",

    "fullText": "It all started a week or two ago, when my partner Maartje found a Dutch translation of Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park somewhere. It is an original 1991 edition. This means the cover image had been produced before the movie was made. It is necessarily completely free of the iconography of the film that would come to overshadow the novel, and indeed overshadow all other dinosaur media. That logo, that skeleton, that font, the designs of those dinosaurs and those characters which are all etched into our collective consciousness, none of it shows up on the cover. It’s a thing unto itself, and it is a thing to behold indeed. I’ll show it to you in a minute, but it got me thinking.\n\nHow many more of these are out there? How many localizations of Crichton’s sci-fi novel have been produced around the world, with unique cover art that predates the Spielberg film? How many of these were produced by book cover artists who in normal circumstances would have never illustrated anything close to a dinosaur? I took to the Internet, and the results exceeded all my expectations. It is true that most versions of the book you can get nowadays simply have the well-known logo on the cover. Boring! Nevertheless, I found a wealth of unique and remarkable, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, book covers that are independent from the visual language of the movie. Not all of these predate the film proper, but they were still unique enough to include. As a connoisseur of kitschy dinosaur Europeana, I’m gonna review a bunch o them! And I’ll save the Dutch one for last, because I’m a tease like that.\n\nLet’s start in Italy. This, too, is a 1991 original (the novel itself is from 1990, but translations take a while). I must admit that, in most cases, I have no idea who produced these book covers; I’m not quite committed enough to get a copy of all of these myself to find out. That’s a shame, because as far as these go, I see a pretty servicable dinosaur here. Believe me, they get much worse… The eagle-eyed among you will have recognized the influence of Burian, specifically his 1959 Allosaurus. The environment it’s stomping around in looks less like a high-tech theme park in the Costa Rican jungle and more like a cheap resort in Florida. I bet that house looked like that before the dinosaur attack. The dinosaur looks smaller than you’d expect, too, compared to these humans. Poundland Jurassic Park. A nice pulpy book cover, very appropriate for the novel.\n\nStaying in Southern Europe, this 1992 Spanish edition is simultaneously more stylish and more freaky. This highly stylized dinosaur looks more like some quadrupedal mammalian monster rearing up, some sort of awful earless dog. The stance and forelimbs are obviously referenced from a four-legged animal. Sit, Rex. This is what happens when an artist with no prior experience in dinosaurs, no relevant palaeoart reference points, and no internet tries this sort of thing; it can only happen in very specific circumstances, and it could not happen today. That’s why these vintage covers are irresistible to me.\n\nThis Polish edition comes not with a cover illustration, but with model photography. It’s a perfectly decent 1990s T. rex model, better than any toy from around this time anyway. However, it’s still obviously made of plastic and gives the book a slightly cheap vibe. Would you be seen on the train reading this?\n\nApparently, this is what the original 1991 German edition looked like. Sadly, I’ve found no higher resolution image than this. It might be faked, but it’s extremely eccentric anyway. Thanks to Maike for sending me a good photo! It’s real! A stylized, simplified cover in jolly primary colours with a jolly dinosaur silhouette, complete with jolly bizarro proportions. Those long arms are really something. According to the comments, it’s based on Peter Zallinger. I just know that the shadowy guy running away is the same dork who waves at all the dinosaurs in all the size charts on Wikipedia. Those playful fonts and colours don’t really sell the danger of the story to me. I love how the original German title of the book was just “Dinopark”.\n\nThere’s been a ton of different German editions over the years. Many of these are delightfully offbeat. Here’s another model T. rex in extreme close up. The infamous Jurassic Park font makes an appearance here, so we’re post-movie.\n\nGermany is the gift that keeps giving; this one is as recent as 2005. This one is especially baffling. The font in the title could be that a romance novel. The backround is a swamp, while the dinosaur model looks especially cheap and ugly. The German text on the cover explains how this novel and Spielberg’s film conquered the world. Just a complete mishmash of unrelated elements on this book cover.\n\nAnother German-language edition. This might be the Austrian one, though I’m not sure. This is the most stylish one we’ve seen so far, and for obvious reason: plagiarism! You’ve no doubt recognized Burian’s heroic Tarbosaurus on the cover here, even if it has been silhouetted out and given a different background. I won’t deny this looks cool, though. You can’t go wrong with Burian.\n\nSpeaking of Burian: what about Czechia? Disappointingly, the land that brought forth the world’s greatest palaeoartist has to make do with nothing but re-used stock art on the cover. If you’re my age, you will probably recognize this as the Neil Lloyd T. rex from Dinosaurs! Magazine! It doesn’t look like a whole lot of effort went into this book cover.\n\nBut we can always do worse. Here’s a later Czech version, with none other than the Papo T. rex on the cover! Absolutely no shame. Zdeněk must be turning in his grave.\n\nHere’s at last something that looks like original artwork to me. Or is this something pre-existing, cut out from its original background? Anyway, this is an Hungarian edition. Nothing especially noteworthy here; just a slightly dodgy drooling dinosaur.\n\nThis one is also Hungarian. From 1996, so the movie logo makes an appearance, but it’s weird enough to be interesting. At the top, we see a bizarre, goofy, wild-eyed cartoon dinosaur in various stages of polygonal rendering… did the cover artist confuse genetic research with computer generated art? It does look oddly frog-like, that’s an important plot point in the story. The rex skull is absent from the logo, where’d it go? I think this is the sequel, The Lost World. Sziget means island (as every European hipster definitely knows), so this reads “Monster Island”, while the above means “Park of Primitive Creatures”. I also appreciate how the author of this book is called Cmriicchhateoln. Graphic Design is my passion!\n\nI’m a big fan of this Swedish edition. It captures some of that childlike wonder. There’s a bit of Burian in that T. rex, and maybe a bit of Bernard Robinson? Copied from one of those ubiquitous 80s/90s T. rex images you’d see places. I don’t know, I’ve seen so much of this stuff, man. The covers uses a variation of the Jurassic Park Neuland font, so it must be a post-movie edition.\n\nRussia can always be relied upon for quality idiosyncratic covers, and they do not disappoint. The dinosaur that greets us on this purple cover is even cute, with those big hamster cheeks and friendly eyes. At the same time, it’s not the worst T. rex we’ve seen on these covers by a long shot, with the shape of the skull actually quite well observed. I have a hard time finding this one scary, though.\n\nHere’s another Russian edition, and this has to be one of my favourites. The creature on the cover here looks as much like a dragon as it does a dinosaur. Contrasting with the previous one, this is a completely fanciful creature that is, again, not produced by anyone who’s ever done dinosaurs before. It doesn’t even have arms. If anything, this looks like the skull lizard creatures of Kong: Skull Island. The typography and design on this one are absolutely 90s-tastic.\n\nOut of the many Russian editions I found, this one looks the classiest. As I live and breathe, that looks like an honest-to-Zeus piece of actual competent palaeoart on the cover! It could be Greg Paul or one of his disciples. I hope it wasn’t stolen. The elegant font completes the picture. I don’t like the orange, though.\n\nAnother favourite is this Turkish version, from 1993. It came out to tie in with the film, but the artwork is original. Once again, our T. rex is completely monstrous and out there. It’s based on Frazetta, probably. It’s more of a vintage guy-in-a-suit Godzilla than anything, and the sauropods haven’t got the memo yet about how they’re not supposed to be in the water. The scalation on the T. rex is interesting, they look less like the big scales of an animal and more like rocks, as if the creature is some sort of golem, made from the very Earth itself. This vintage Turkish edition was on sale for the better part of 100 dollars, which goes some ways towards explaining why I decided against starting a collection of these.\n\nMost Asian editions of the novel didn’t come out before the film, so those covers are overwhelmingly film-related, and not very interesting. An exception is this 1996 Thai version. Again, I think this this the sequel. Although the logo, the gate and the font are all there from the film, we do get some original, illustrated dinosaurs. I say “original”. Rather than Burian, the inspiration this time seems to have been John Sibbick, his highly recognizable T. rex and Velociraptor dutifully traced. I wish I had a higher resolution version of this one.\n\nAnd here’s the Dutch version that I promised you! I don’t mean to brag, but surely this is the king of weird vintage JP book covers? Look at that thing! What is even going on here? Is this made by someone who not only has never illustrated a dinosaur before, but never even seen a dinosaur before? What is going on with that arm? How does its neck work? Is that its back? Look at that five-fingered hand. Wait, which way does its knee bend? Is its leg backwards, or am I? What even is reality? Is that the face of 1998 Godzilla? I’m so confused. Please send help. Anyway, I have this one, so I can tell you who’s responsible. The image is credited to the brothers Schriemer who studied in the same town as me, so credit where credit is due. Er gaat niets boven Groningen. Five stars.",

    "fullText": "Khaby Lame, the Senegalese-born TikTok star with the largest following on the platform, has struck a landmark commercial deal valued at approximately $900 million, marking one of the most significant monetisation moves ever by a global digital creator.\n\nThe transaction involves the partial sale of his company, Step Distinctive Limited, to Rich Sparkle Holdings, a United States-listed firm that disclosed the acquisition alongside a broader strategic partnership focused on scaling Lame’s commercial operations worldwide.\n\nUnder the agreement, Rich Sparkle, through its operating partners, will hold exclusive rights to Khaby Lame’s global commercial activities for an initial period of 36 months.\n\nThese rights cover brand partnerships, endorsements, licensing, and e-commerce ventures, signalling a shift from traditional influencer marketing to a platform-driven business model.\n\nRich Sparkle estimates that the integrated structure combining traffic, fulfilment, operations, and proprietary technology could eventually generate more than $4 billion in annual sales once fully implemented.\n\nAs part of the deal, Khaby Lame will become a controlling shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings, positioning him not just as a creative partner but as an equity stakeholder in the commercial infrastructure built around his brand.\n\n“This is not just an equity acquisition, but a revolution in the global content e-commerce model,” the company said, adding that the combination of a US-listed platform, globally recognised content IP, and supply chain expertise could unlock unprecedented shareholder value.\n\nThe rollout of the commercial strategy will initially focus on the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, with execution planned over the next three years. Rich Sparkle will work with Anhui Xiaoheiyang Network Technology Co., Ltd., a China-based content commerce operator with experience in large-scale creator-led e-commerce.\n\nKhaby Lame rose to global prominence through silent, minimalist videos that humorously dismantle overly complicated life hacks. His wordless format has allowed him to transcend language barriers and build a vast, culturally diverse audience at remarkable speed.\n\nHe currently commands an estimated 360 million followers across social media platforms, making him one of the most influential digital figures in the world and a rare example of truly global creator reach.\n\nBeyond conventional commerce, the agreement also authorises the development of an AI-powered digital twin of Lame, enabling regulated use of his facial features, voice patterns, and behavioural cues.\n\nRich Sparkle says this could support multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and round-the-clock engagement.\n\nThe broader strategy also includes premium brand collaborations and co-branded intellectual property in sectors such as beauty, fragrance, and apparel, highlighting how creator influence is increasingly being transformed into long-term industrial-scale businesses.",

    "description": "More than 36,500 Iranians were killed by security forces during the January 8-9 crackdown on nationwide protests, making it the deadliest two-day protest massacre in history, according to documents reviewed by Iran International's Editorial Board.",
    "fullText": "For more than two weeks and counting, the country has existed inside a manufactured silence. The public internet, the basic infrastructure of modern life, has been reduced to rumor and fragments. What remains functional are the regime’s approved channels, whitelisted networks that keep the state connected to itself while cutting the country off from civic circulation.\n\nFrom outside Iran, this condition is often described as another episode of unrest. From inside, it feels closer to a new revolution that has already cost the country thousands of lives.\n\nIran has experienced a massacre and entered a post-massacre moment, a phase in which the state no longer performs restraint. It kills, buries, rewrites the narrative, and disconnects.\n\nThe blackout is not a byproduct of disorder. It is part of the machinery. Violence is easier to carry out when it is harder to document, and easier to deny when proof is delayed, partial, or erased.\n\nFrom the studio of The Program with Kambiz Hosseini, where Iranians have been calling into a live call-in program broadcast to Iran, the question no longer sounds abstract. It sounds prosecutorial.\n\nWhat, exactly, does the world believe it is watching?\n\nThe calls do not arrive as speeches. They arrive as exertion, as voices pushing through dead air and dropped connections.\n\nAli, calling from Mazandaran in northern Iran, addresses the security forces directly. “You do not need to put your weapon down. No one is afraid of you.” He repeats it, not as bravado, but as fact. Fear, he suggests, is no longer the organizing principle.\n\nPouria, calling from Shiraz in southern Iran, offers a different register. “We did not abandon a single wounded person, and we did not allow anyone to be left behind or written off.” The language is practical, almost logistical. It describes a moral line that held even as institutions collapsed. Do not leave anyone behind.\n\nBahram, from a working-class neighborhood in southern Tehran, explains why he went into the streets. “For my country, and for my children.” It is not an ideological statement. It is an intergenerational one.\n\nMahsa, from Najafabad, asks for something simpler. “I want to tell the story of my city.” The request itself is an indictment. In Iran today, telling the story of a place can be an act of defiance.\n\nFrom the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, Alia’s anger is controlled and unsentimental. “You thought we were afraid. We are not afraid. We are angry, and we are waiting.” She repeats it, sharpening the point. “They think we are afraid. We are not. We are angry, and we are waiting.” She does not ask to be comforted. She asks to be heard.\n\nThese voices share a quality that has become rare in authoritarian systems. They are unembellished. They do not seek spectacle. They insist on being recorded.\n\nThat insistence recalls the life of Raha Bohlouli-Pour, a university student who was shot and killed by Iranian security forces near Fatemi Square in Tehran on January 8, 2026. Raha, whose name in Farsi means free, was interested in art and music, according to her online profiles.\n\nShe was not an organizer or a public figure. She carried no slogans and belonged to no faction. In a political culture trained to search for enemies, she was unexceptional.\n\nRaha did not die because she exercised power or issued demands. She died because she embodied a way of being the state has learned to fear. Her generation does not aspire to heroic gestures or sacrificial myths. It seeks something quieter and more difficult to suppress, the right to live an ordinary life with dignity, continuity, and attention. To breathe without permission. To imagine tomorrow without explanation.\n\nShe left behind no manifesto. What remains are fragments, short reflections, carefully chosen lines. Her language returns again and again to elemental concerns, breathing, continuing, tomorrow. Even when fear appears, it is not dramatized. Her writing is restrained and lucid. If it is political, it is so in the most basic sense. It insists that being alive is not negotiable.\n\nOne detail matters. Raha wrote names. She named detainees and the missing. She recorded people as people, not as abstractions. She understood how repression begins, not with bullets, but with erasure. Violence becomes easier once names disappear and individuals dissolve into numbers.\n\nThat is why the callers matter. They produce the most destabilizing thing such a state can face, a record. Names. Places. Timelines. Descriptions of fear moving through neighborhoods, and of solidarity moving faster. Strangers pulling one another out of danger. Shopkeepers closing doors. Families taking risks that would be unthinkable in a normal society.\n\nNavid, a physician from Tehran, describes hospitals overwhelmed, security forces stationed inside wards, families pleading for information, and staff pushed beyond exhaustion into something closer to moral injury. He does not sound ideological. He sounds like someone trying, with diminishing success, to remain human inside a system designed to punish humanity.\n\nThe numbers, always and only the numbers, arrive as estimates.\n\nOne widely cited figure suggests the death toll may exceed twenty thousand. Whether the final count is higher or lower will matter to historians and prosecutors. The deeper point is simpler. The state has made counting dangerous, and then uses uncertainty as camouflage.\n\nThis is what post-massacre means.\n\nNot only that people have been killed, but that proving they were killed becomes a second battlefield.\n\nPeople no longer sound shocked. They sound worn down by the reliability of cruelty.\n\nIran today is no longer merely in internal crisis. When a government treats its own population as an enemy force, the consequences do not remain contained. They ripple outward through refugee flows, regional instability, and a precedent that other regimes quietly study.\n\nThe calls continue coming into the show. Not because a phone line can defeat a security apparatus, but because history is written by those who insist on being counted as human.\n\nThe state can disrupt the signal. It cannot fully erase the insistence.\n\nThat insistence, name by name and breath by breath, may be the most dangerous thing in Iran right now.\n\nWhat we are witnessing in Iran today can be categorized as a crime against humanity.",

    "title": "A developer teamed up with Claude to create Elo programming language",
    "description": "feature: Bernard Lambeau, the human half of a pair programming team, explains how he's using AI",
    "fullText": "feature Bernard Lambeau, a Belgium-based software developer and founder of several technology companies, created a programming language called Elo with the help of Anthropic's Claude Code.\n\nStarting on December 25, 2025, he published a series of posts about the project. The first post names Claude as a co-author.\n\n\"In roughly 24 hours of collaboration, we built a complete expression language with a parser, type system, three compilers, a standard library, a CLI tool, and a documentation website. Not bad for a day's work,” Lambeau and Claude wrote.\n\n\"Elo isn't just a demonstration that AI can write code. It's a demonstration that humans and AI can build together – each contributing what they do best,” they added.\n\nAs an expression language that compiles to JavaScript, Ruby, and SQL, Elo is intended as a portable way to handle form validation, e-commerce order processing, and subscription logic.\n\nLambeau, founder and CTO of Klaro Cards and CEO of app consultancy Enspirit, is not the first to develop a programming language with the help of AI.\n\nSteve Klabnik performed a similar feat last year with the Rue programming language. In September 2025, Geoffrey Huntley enlisted Claude to write a programming language called Cursed. And before that, Avital Tamir published a Claude-authored repo for the Server programming language, with the caveat that the code is not intended for actual use.\n\nClaude Code isn't the only AI-assisted programming method having a moment. AI biz Cursor created a rudimentary browser using OpenAI's GPT-5.2. And developer Ola Prøis used Cursor, powered by Claude, to create a Rust-based text editor called Ferrite.\n\nClaude users generally acknowledge that their pair partner makes mistakes. But those committed to AI assistance find it worthwhile to clean up after their helper.\n\n\"Claude Code knows almost every tech stack (and can search the web), knows the Linux commands that matter (search code, search & replace, compile, test, etc.), and does that 10x faster than I can do myself,\" Lambeau told The Register in an email interview.\n\nClaude, he said, allows him to use technology he hasn't mastered.\n\n\"I was already a full-stack developer (on languages, frameworks & reusable libraries I knew); I'm now a full-stack++ dev because I can also use languages, frameworks, and reusable libraries I barely know, if at all,\" he explained.\n\n\"Claude Code falls short if you don't have a great methodology. It needs feedback loops to work fine; otherwise, it derails. One possible feedback loop is a human reviewing code and testing manually. But there's a better/complementary approach if you want it to work autonomously. On both Elo and Bmg.js, I've started by making sure the testing methodology was effective and scientifically sound. Claude writes the tests, executes them, discovers where it's wrong, and corrects itself. Impressive.\"\n\nLambeau said he still needs to review some of Claude's output.\n\n\"But if I read the tests, agree with them, and can check myself that they run fine, I'm 95 percent sure it's already correct as a black box (not even reading the code),\" he explained. \"Then I can check the architecture and code quality as a white box by having a general look at the code, but I don't have to understand every detail.\"\n\nNotably, Lambeau documented the series of prompts he used to create the language. The repo includes more than 100 tasks used to direct the AI model. In addition, Lambeau has published a video that describes his AI pair programming process.\n\n\"I started in a setting where Claude Code asked for permissions every 20 seconds and I was checking everything it did,\" Lambeau explained. \"After a few successes, I quickly set up safe environments to be able to let Claude Code run in full autonomy (isolated computer & isolated Linux user, or running in a Docker image).\"\n\nLambeau said he still uses plan mode for complex tasks that require conversation with Claude.\n\n\"I review the plan, make sure we have a test strategy that's sound, then switch Claude to autonomous mode and look at the tests, code & results afterward,\" he said. \"That's very similar to a lead-dev/CTO + QA role, btw; it's just much faster than with human devs.\"\n\nLambeau, who has a PhD in software engineering and 30 years of experience as a developer, said both experts and novices can benefit from Claude Code, though he added that a service like Lovable might be more approachable for those not already acclimated to the command line.\n\n\"Now, when it comes to real software/product engineering, I think Claude Code requires experts (so far),\" he said. \"You still need to guide it a lot to keep the quality high enough. You need very strong expertise to do it effectively. Currently (Claude will still improve a lot), if you don't have the expertise, you certainly end up with a big mess of unmaintainable code.\"\n\nMany developers have said as much about AI tools. They're more useful as an amplifier of expertise than as a replacement for it. The situation is analogous to the introduction of sequencing software, digital synthesizers, and drum machines half a century ago. These tools enabled a lot of people who weren't great musicians to make music. But they didn't instill musical skill, and they produced the most interesting work in the hands of practiced musicians.\n\nThe cost to do this, Lambeau said, has been a Claude Max subscription that he purchased in December for €180 a month. In that time, he says, he wrote Elo (https://elo-lang.org), completed Bmg.js (https://github.com/enspirit/bmg.js), completed Bmg's documentation (https://www.relational-algebra.dev), and created the first version of the Try page (https://www.relational-algebra.dev/try).\n\n\"It's all personal research and open-source projects,\" he said. \"It would have required several weeks to do the same manually myself, and several months to ask another developer to do it. The cost would be mostly because of the scientific & technical knowledge transfer about the data language I envision. Strangely enough, it's very cheap with Claude Code. There's something true about the fact that those LLMs have a PhD.\"\n\nLambeau explained that Elo isn't just a way to test Claude Code. He also sees it as an extension of his academic work in software engineering and his personal interest in the Relational Model – he's served as a lecturer for database courses at Belgium’s UCLouvain.\n\n\"I'm absolutely convinced that we need better/safer/simpler programming languages inside no-code tools and when interconnecting them (e.g. Zapier, Make, n8n, etc.),\" he said. \"Mainstream programming languages are very complex, error-prone, sometimes dangerous, and the programs are difficult to review for non-experts.\"\n\n\"More importantly, they are cumbersome to use for even simple data tasks. I mean, even validating the schema and constraints of a data file at runtime tends to be a nightmare in existing languages. It's not built-in in any mainstream language; you immediately need validation libraries; most of them are limited in what they can easily check, so you need to add dedicated boilerplate code.\"\n\nIn a world where non-technical people will have the opportunity to write untrustworthy code with the help of AI, he said, we need to be able to run that code safely.\n\n\"Elo aims at providing a safe & simple alternative,\" he said. \"It will be a limited language (non-Turing-complete, as we say) but super safe & simple, and usable in 80 percent of common data use cases. The very first no-code tool to integrate it will be Klaro Cards, of course.\" ®",

By the point\nthat I left, zero teams had been hired through the BYOT mechanism, although we did talk to some.\nOn the other hand, one of the hiring ideas that Stripe didn’t blog about publicly,\nbut worked extremely well in practice, is the idea of Lighthouse Hiring.\n\nLighthouse Hiring is the idea that hiring well-connected folks makes subsequent\nhires both easier and higher quality. Sure, hiring those well-known folks is\ndifficult, but if you’re trying to hire ten great people, then spending more\ntime hiring one “lighthouse hire” can improve the quality and velocity of the overall hiring push.\n\nA few examples of Stripe’s lighthouse hiring:\n\nThere are many other examples you could pick from, and importantly not all of them are widely-known,\njust widely-connected.\nJulia is a tech internet mainstay, but Raylene operated more from personal\nnetworks rather than social media networks. Any sort of high quality network\ncan be the underpinning of a successful lighthouse hire.\n\nThis mechanism worked exceptionally well, but there is a complex underside\nto Lighthouse Hires: strong networks, particularly publicly visible networks,\ncreate a complex power dynamic that some managers can struggle to navigate.\nIf you’re relying on a public personality, and they get frustrated at work,\nthen your lighthouse hiring strategy is going to implode on you.\nSimilarly, hiring them to begin with can be a challenge if\nyou don’t have an interesting role, but carving out a uniquely interesting\nrole for one hire will come across as biased internally, undermining your relationship\nwith the broader team.\n\nThese are all navigable, and I think Stripe would have been less successful\nif it hadn’t used this pattern, but it takes some nuance to deploy effectively.",

    "description": ": Deprecation of popular management tool requires a new look at Azure-based system",
    "fullText": "Microsoft recently announced it will deprecate System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) Management Packs (MPs) for SQL Server Reporting Services, Power BI Report Server,and SQL Server Analysis Services.\n\nWhile this affects a relatively small subset of SQL Server users, the move could force some organizations into monitoring solutions that expose their server deployments to Microsoft's licensing auditors, one analyst pointed out.\n\nThe affected SCOM management packs will remain available until January 2027, after which they'll no longer be supported. \"No new updates will be released, including no support for SQL Server 2025 or SCOM 2025,\" the notice said.\n\nMicrosoft said the products would no longer have official SCOM MPs for these products.\n\nSCOM is a popular management tool for Microsoft on-premises server product, supporting not just SQL Server, but also Exchange, Windows and SharePoint to manage updates, security changes, and patches.\n\nMicrosoft said the deprecation means existing management packs would continue to function in SCOM 2019 and SCOM 2022, but no new features, fixes, or security updates would be provided. And compatibility with later versions can not be guaranteed.\n\nThe software giant recommended affected users plan their migration to Azure-based monitoring solutions using Azure Monitor, Azure Arc and Log Analytics. This creates \"a unified alternative that offers centralized telemetry ingestion, alerting, performance monitoring, and dashboarding for hybrid and on‑premises environments,\" the vendor claimed.\n\nAndrew Snodgrass, analyst with Directions on Microsoft, said the Windows giant had ignored SCOM for a while, and he was advising clients to move away from it.\n\n\"Find a third party if you want to stay on-prem, but Microsoft's gonna start slowly killing this thing off the way they do,\" he told The Reg. With the alternative, customers can no longer download updates directly; they can only do it through Azure Arc, and in the process, they have to register their on-prem servers in Azure.\n\nSnodgrass said the Azure monitoring platform offered some \"really cool stuff\" for managing a SQL Server estate, especially hybrid users.\n\n\"What it requires is that – quite reasonably – you install an agent on your physical server or on your virtual server, whether that's in AWS, Azure or on-prem. This is the Azure Arc monitoring agent that is going to run locally, and it's going to connect up to Azure,\" he said.\n\nFrom a management point of view it works well, added Snodgrass, because admins can use a single Azure SQL management system and see all the servers and databases, regardless of their environment.\n\n\"But those who don't want to use Azure, or want to remain on-prem, will need to find an alternative local third-party management tool. SQL Server has been out for decades, so there's some really lovely management tools. There are also a few that will also manage your Windows Server and your Exchange servers as well.\"\n\nAlthough Microsoft has given no indication that the data could be used for anything other than software management, users should be aware that there is the potential for implications when it comes to license management.\n\n\"If you use the Azure SQL to manage all of these deployments, wherever they are, whether they're on prem or in AWS or Azure, then you're registering every one of your SQL Servers with Azure. That list is going to be out. Doesn't mean that Microsoft necessarily would, but if an audit comes along, they certainly could go out there and say, 'You know what, you've got this whole list here, and we look at the license count that you bought from us, and you don't have enough licenses to cover all these servers you've deployed',\" he said.\n\nOrganizations deliberately using unlicensed software do not have much of a defense, but there are grey areas, such as downloading SQL Server for software development using a Visual Studio license.\n\n\"If I were monitoring and managing all this stuff through the Azure tools, it can't delineate between production and development, and it would assume that all for those are production machines, and therefore I should buy licenses for them.\"\n\nSnodgrass advises clients to get a clear picture of the number of SQL Servers in production and those used for development before negotiating with Microsoft over licenses.\n\nThe Register has asked Microsoft to comment. ®",

    "title": "'Super' Battleship USS Texas Relocating With A Major Facelift In 2026",
    "description": "The USS Texas has endured a lot since it was commissioned in 1914, and 2026 will see it on display in refurbished condition in a brand-new location.",
    "fullText": "Though the American battleship has long since been overshadowed as the U.S. Navy's most prolific and strategically important warship by the aircraft carrier, World War II-era battleships will forever be a crucial part of naval history. Fortunately for fans of American military and naval history, there are several U.S. battleships open to the public across the United States, where these classic vessels can be toured and appreciated.\n\nThe first of these museum battleships was the USS Texas (BB-35), which has been owned and operated by the State of Texas as a memorial since the late 1940s. With a history that predates other battleships like the Missouri and Iowa, the Texas is America's only surviving warship to have fought in both World Wars. And now, after years of uncertainty, the future of this historic vessel is looking bright, with work underway to move the ship to a new permanent home at the Port of Galveston.\n\nAnd when the new and improved USS Texas Museum opens, it won't just be displayed as an old and dilapidated relic. Instead, it will be a ship that will have undergone a thorough and costly $75 million restoration process to bring it back to its full, period-correct, World War II glory.\n\nMost of America's battleship museums are ships of the Iowa Class, which were commissioned during World War II and served into the 1990s. The Texas represents a much older era of battleships that played a pivotal role in both major theaters of World War II. Commissioned in 1914 as one of the U.S. Navy's two New York-class ships (which the Scientific American referred to as \"super dreadnoughts\"), the Texas quickly went into service supporting American interests during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I, the Texas went to the North Sea, where it served as part of the historic Grand Fleet that oversaw the surrender of the Germans.\n\nThe Texas was modernized in the years between the wars, before again entering combat service in the Atlantic when World War II broke out. The USS Texas first supported the Allies during the North Africa campaign, then attacked German targets and supported the Allied Invasion force at Omaha Beach on D-Day in 1944. The ship would return to the U.S. for more modernizations before being sent to the Pacific Theater to fight the Japanese during the American invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\n\nFinally, the Texas ended its naval service by bringing American soldiers and sailors home during Operation Magic Carpet Ride in the months following the war. With newer battleships in the fleet and an increased focus on carriers, the aging ship was decommissioned and donated to the State of Texas in 1948.\n\nThe USS Texas was the first American battleship to become a permanent museum, located at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site. After decades on display and, with the ship's condition deteriorating, the Texas was moved to dry dock in 2022 to begin a series of repairs and renovations. Not only are these renovations addressing serious structural issues that would cause the ship to take on water, but the Texas is also receiving a full restoration with rebuilt structures, a new wooden deck, and fresh paint throughout to preserve the atmosphere of its combat days. So far, the process has required over 400,000 hours of labor, with over 700 tons of steel being replaced.\n\nWith the extensive four-plus-year restoration nearing completion at the start of 2026, the ship has secured its new home at Pier 15 in Galveston, where plans are underway for dredging, a permanent mooring, and brand new shoreside facilities to complete the museum. The Battleship Texas Foundation hopes to have the ship in place and the museum open to the public in late 2026 or early 2027. When the new and improved USS Texas Museum reopens, it will join the Aircraft Carrier USS Lexington Museum in Corpus Christi as one of the must-visit spots for military history on the Texas Gulf Coast.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "title": "After my divorce, my kids move between homes every week. Buying 2 of everything reduced their stress.",
    "description": "A divorced parent explains why she buys duplicate clothes and personal care items so her kids feel settled while moving between homes.",
    "fullText": "After my divorce, my kids started living out of bags, going back and forth between my home and their dad's each week.\n\nIt's been like this for five years, but this school year added something new to the shuffle. My son and daughter, now 11 and 13, suddenly became interested in styling their hair every morning. They wanted specific hair care products and personal care items of their own.\n\nSuddenly, we weren't just packing clothes, shoes, school bags, and sports equipment; we were also packing hair products, favorite shampoos, perfumes, colognes, and body washes. I love when my home and bathroom smell like my kids' favorite scents, but practically speaking, it felt ridiculous to schlep all of it back and forth every week.\n\nThis winter, I started buying two of the special items they love, making the back-and-forth easier and easing some of the stress that comes with not having small comforts.\n\nI bought duplicate shampoos my daughter loves, one for my house and one for her dad's. I found a smaller, on-sale bottle of the Replica perfume she's obsessed with, so she could keep it with her. My son is really into his hair products, and I've started stocking up on those, along with the body washes he likes. He wanted a Versace cologne, so I bought a full-size bottle for my home and a travel-size version for him to bring with him.\n\nMy kids are also at the age where a random zit can feel like a crisis, so I bought each of them an extra moisturizer to help with blemishes, plus an extra box of pimple patches they can share at their other home. In a way, I hope these products are helpful when I'm not there to offer advice. As a worrier, it brings me relief knowing they have what they need wherever they are.\n\nAs a divorced parent, I've remained the default for buying clothes, shoes, school supplies, and now personal care items. I pay attention to what makes my kids feel confident. I often ask myself, would I want to go a full week without my favorite shampoo or hair product? Knowing they have the things they love, even in smaller or travel-size versions, makes me feel better no matter whose week it is.\n\nOf course, not everything can be duplicated. My son has one pair of Apple headphones that goes back and forth. My daughter's iPad travels with her. They each have a phone. The clothes they love are packed into reusable bags every week, along with three or four pairs of shoes. In cooler months, sweaters and jackets get added to the pile.\n\nPacking up their lives is exhausting. Sometimes I pack for them even though they're capable, because I understand the emotional weight of the divorced-kid routine. I wouldn't want to do what they do every week: loading bags with clothes, shoes, sports equipment, backpacks, Chromebooks, and then living out of them.\n\nI could coordinate more with their dad or create shared shopping lists, but our relationship didn't end well, and I'd rather limit contact. What matters most is that my kids have what they need without worry.\n\nOnce the car is loaded, I always tell them I'll see them soon. We share a moment, maybe a joke, a memory, a compliment, or something to look forward to. Watching the other door close always hurts. My love for them rises straight to my eyes. I take a deep breath as I walk back to my car. I miss them immediately, but knowing they have the things that make them feel good while we're apart warms my heart.",

    "description": "A federal immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti, a US citizen, in Minneapolis on Saturday. He was an ICU nurse at a VA hospital.",
    "fullText": "America's largest network of labor unions has condemned ICE after a federal agent on Saturday shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, which represents nearly 15 million workers, called Pretti's death \"senseless.\"\n\n\"As tens of thousands of Minnesotans made clear peacefully and powerfully yesterday, the Trump administration's horrific operation — and their actions aimed at stoking violence and chaos — must end,\" the labor group said in a statement.\n\n\"America's unions join the call for ICE to immediately leave Minnesota before anyone else is hurt or killed. We demand local authorities conduct a full, transparent investigation that will lead to accountability for this tragic and violent act, and for Congress to use its power to hold ICE accountable.\"\n\nA federal agent fatally shot Pretti in Minneapolis, where he worked as an ICU nurse at a US Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Minneapolis police confirmed on Saturday that Pretti is a US citizen. He had been filming the agents when the confrontation began.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Border Patrol and ICE, said Pretti was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and \"approached\" agents at the scene. The department said officers tried to disarm Pretti, but he resisted. In multiple videos of the incident, however, Pretti is never seen threatening agents and is disarmed and subdued before he is shot. Minneapolis police said Pretti had a permit to carry the weapon.\n\nThe DHS deployed ICE and other federal agents to Minnesota as part of an immigration enforcement sweep called Operation Metro Surge, which began in December. The department says it has deployed around 2,000 federal agents across the state to detain and deport illegal immigrants. Trump has made securing the border and deporting those in the US who lack proper paperwork a central part of his administration's agenda.\n\nLocal residents and business owners, however, have criticized the tactics federal agents are using to find and detain those people, resulting in protests across the state. Tensions further escalated after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, on January 7.\n\nThe CEOs of Minnesota's largest businesses, including Target, Cargill, Allianz, and UnitedHealth, called for \"immediate de-escalation\" in a joint statement on Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday, Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bernie Burnham shared a statement calling for a \"full and transparent investigation\" into the recent shootings.\n\n\"'Operation Metro Surge' is not and has never been about enforcing immigration law. This is about a President who is angry with the people of Minnesota for disagreeing with his policies and is weaponizing the federal government against us in retribution,\" Burnham said.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing Pretti and other federal workers in the US, also criticized the Trump administration in a statement on Saturday. As an employee of the VA hospital, Pretti was a member of AFGE Local 3669.\n\n\"While details of the incident are still emerging, one fact is already clear: this tragedy did not happen in a vacuum. It is the direct result of an administration that has chosen reckless policy, inflammatory rhetoric, and manufactured crisis over responsible leadership and de-escalation,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in the statement.\n\nKelley said the presence of federal agents has stoked fear and division in the community.\n\n\"I urge everyone to remain disciplined and measured in public, even as we are rightly angry. Still, we must do what we can to maintain peace and calm,\" Kelley said. \"But do not mistake restraint for acceptance. Accountability will come, and AFGE will not be silent about the policies and decisions that led us here.\"",

    "fullText": "The CEOs of Minnesota's most prominent businesses are calling for local, state, and federal officials to find a solution as tensions skyrocket the day after federal agents shot and killed a second person in Minneapolis.\n\nA Border Patrol agent killed Alex Pretti, 37, a US citizen who worked as a nurse at the local Veterans Affairs hospital, on Saturday morning. Pretti had been filming federal immigration agents when the confrontation began.\n\nMinneapolis and neighboring St. Paul have been the site of continuous protests since the Department of Homeland Security flooded the cities with immigration agents in December. Tensions have been especially high since an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good on January 7.\n\nThe Minnesota Chamber of Commerce distributed a letter on Sunday signed by more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies calling for \"de-escalation.\"\n\nAmong the signatories were the leaders of major corporations: Target CEO Michael Fiddelke, 3M CEO William Brown, Allianz Life Insurance Company CEO Jasmine Jirele, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening, and UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley, among many others.\n\nThe letter called for an \"immediate de-escalation of tensions\" and for state, local, and federal officials to \"work together to find real solutions.\"\n\n\"In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state, and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,\" the letter says.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's immigration policies have long been the subject of sharp debate among business and tech leaders, many of whom have sought to curry favor during the president's second term.\n\nSome tech leaders, in fact, were at the White House on Saturday night to attend a screening of the new documentary about Melania Trump, which was produced by Melania Trump. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy were both expected to attend, according to multiple reports.\n\nMeanwhile, some employees at those companies and others are calling on their bosses to speak out against ICE actions across the country.\n\nA petition with over 250 signatures, titled \"Tech demands ICE out of our cities,\" a group of employees is calling on tech leaders to \"pick up the phone\" and call the White House to demand ICE \"leave our cities.\" They are also demanding that their companies cancel any contracts they have with ICE. The bulk of the signatories said in the petition that they worked for Amazon and Google.\n\nAfter the latest fatal shooting in Minneapolis, some business and tech leaders themselves took to social media to say their piece.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund owner Bill Ackman called for calm while blaming Minnesota state officials for provoking the violence.\n\nJames Dyett, an exec at OpenAI, criticized the tech community for not speaking up. \"There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,\" Dyer wrote on X. \"Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.\"",

    "fullText": "Former Vice President Al Gore was characteristically calm yet blunt during a conversation with Bloomberg News about the global energy transition at a major gathering of world leaders this week.\n\nEach year, the World Economic Forum hosts world leaders, academics, scientists, and business executives in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThat event — dubbed simply \"Davos\" in the media — kicked off on Jan. 19 with the theme \"A Spirit of Dialogue\" for 2026.\n\nFinancial news outlet Bloomberg has long covered the annual forum in Davos, establishing \"Bloomberg House\" in 2024 for in-depth discussions, like its sit-down with the former vice president.\n\nGore has long been known for his ecological focus, and 2026 marked 20 years since the release of Gore's book and follow-up film, \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" Both warned that inaction on environmental issues would be costly and deadly.\n\nGore now chairs sustainable investment firm Generation Investment Management, and he was direct in his criticism of the United States' sharp turn away from the clean energy transition.\n\nPrivate equity firm chair and Bloomberg personality David Rubenstein spoke with Gore and asked why in-progress wind farm projects had been halted in the U.S., particularly amid soaring energy prices.\n\nGore, a staid, dutiful foil to his charismatic running mate, former President Bill Clinton, didn't pull punches about the inevitability of transitioning to renewable energy.\n\nHe told Rubenstein that renewables were \"taking over\" worldwide while the U.S. canceled projects nearing completion.\n\n\"We really don't have any choice about this,\" Gore said of the global future of energy, a sentiment that echoed a recent statement by International Renewable Energy Agency director-general Francesco La Camera.\n\nShould the U.S. invest \n\nIt should be private investments\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIn a Jan. 18 report ahead of Davos, Bloomberg reported that the WEF had agreed to \"downplay\" discussion of rising temperatures and other topics considered agitating to the federal government in an effort to secure American participation.\n\nHowever, as Davos convened in Switzerland, political discourse in the U.S. was heavily focused on the cost of basic energy necessities, such as heat and electricity.\n\nActive lawmakers and candidates were often forced to discuss the issue through a lens of current policy or constituent outrage, whereas Gore was under no such constraints.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Gore emphasized that solar and wind were the \"cheapest forms of electricity\" today, an accurate statement that was also consequential as a large share of American homes struggled to afford utilities.\n\nSolar and wind are also widely confirmed to be faster to build than another popular carbon-pollution-reducing solution, nuclear — and even if land acquisition can sometimes be more straightforward for nuclear, the impact on the neighboring towns, including emergency protocols, is far more serious for nuclear than renewable development.\n\nIn November, lawmakers issued an urgent plea to utility providers as more households fell behind and faced shutoffs, and as data center expansion continued to spike costs.\n\nGore's assertion that the U.S. couldn't opt out of the clean energy transition was bolstered by some recent news on that front.\n\nIn January, a district court judge ruled that the federal government acted unlawfully in canceling nearly $8 billion in clean energy projects.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "One week ago, Destiny Jackson spoke with CNN about her family of eight getting tear gassed in Minneapolis while stopped on their way home from her son’s basketball game on January 14.\n\nThe family says they did not realize an anti-ICE protest was happening around them when they first reached the scene. Video from the scene showed her children rushing out of the car and into a nearby house for safety, on the same night a federal agent shot a man in the leg.\n\nIt was one of several interviews Jackson had done that week with different news outlets. Someone asked her to make a GoFundMe, so she did, she said — and donations poured in, raising more than $170,000 in all.\n\nSince then, Jackson tells CNN she has faced online attacks by far-right social media users and select media publications.\n\nThat’s partly because, since CNN published the story, a one-hour-and-36-minute livestream from that evening has surfaced, which was first reported by Crime Watch Mpls and then covered by the Daily Mail, that shows Jackson at the actual protest itself without her children – at one point, making an inflammatory comment on camera.\n\nBut that’s also because Jackson has a past criminal record.\n\nIn two interviews with CNN on January 23 and 24, Jackson explained more about why she was seen at the protest in the livestream and addressed her previous criminal charges.\n\nIn her January 17 interview with CNN, Jackson said she had retrieved her mother from the protest before getting back into her vehicle with her six kids and husband to leave the area.\n\nThat’s when she says she heard commotion from the protest and told her husband to drive away, but said they were blocked in and couldn’t get out. From there, a tear gas canister rolled under her car and exploded.\n\nIn the newly surfaced video, she and her husband appear in and out of frame at or near the protest for at least 45 minutes.\n\nJackson explained she and her husband were driving home from her son’s basketball game when they noticed the road ahead was blocked off. Cars were coming from every direction, while some cars were parked on the street, so they pulled over to allow cars to pass, she said.\n\nHer husband wanted to know what was happening, so he got out of the car to ask around. From the passenger seat, Jackson says she coincidentally noticed her mother, her mother’s boyfriend and a family friend crossing the street. She called out to them and they came to talk to her, explaining they were headed to a protest.\n\nShortly after, her family friend came back to the car because it was too cold. At that point, Jackson said she didn’t want her mom to be at the protest because she was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure, so she walked to the protest to try to get her mother to leave. Her family friend, whom she refers to as “auntie,” stayed in the car to watch Jackson’s children.\n\nJackson said she was trying to get her mom to leave the entire time she was at the demonstration, but added she also talked to people while she was there. Her husband is just “nosy,” and wanted to see what was happening, she said.\n\nIn recent interviews with CNN, she explained she had been able to leave before the situation turned heated, but she had not wanted to because she was focused on her mother. It was when the situation escalated that her family’s vehicle became trapped and they couldn’t get out of the area, Jackson said.\n\nAlthough CNN cannot independently confirm that Jackson’s vehicle was trapped when the protest escalated, Minnesota Attorney General Ellison previously told CNN the family was “caught in the middle of” the situation.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin also said in an email to CNN on January 16: “This family was the victim of rioters and agitators whose lawless behavior is encouraged by Minnesota’s top leaders.”\n\nAbout 10 minutes before the livestream captured what appears to be flash bangs going off, Jackson is seen in the video talking to a friend in a car, away from the demonstration.\n\nThe livestreamer comes up to the two of them, and in response to a prompt from the livestreamer, Jackson says: “We’re going to kill these motherf**kers.”\n\nThe livestreamer responds: “No you not, no she not.”\n\nIt’s unclear, from the video alone, what Jackson meant.\n\n“Shooting and killing people is unacceptable, that was completely taken out of context,” Jackson said to CNN.\n\nShe explained the livestreamer had been talking about guns and weapons, so she claims she was sarcastically asking him if he was going to kill federal agents.\n\n“I was like sarcastically asking him that … I wasn’t saying we’re going to like, that we were gonna kill ICE, no,” she said.\n\nAbout three minutes after Jackson’s comment in the livestream, her husband is seen standing in a crowd of protesters who were chanting, “Pigs, go home.” He is not seen chanting with the protesters in the livestream.\n\nA few minutes later, what appear to be flash-bang devices start to go off and the crowd disperses.\n\nJackson is seen in the passenger seat of her car a few minutes later, recording on her phone. A few seconds later, it appears that a tear gas canister goes off near her vehicle.\n\nJackson tells CNN that they couldn’t move their car once the demonstration near them escalated.\n\nA tear gas canister rolled under the family’s car and exploded underneath it, she said. Bystanders helped her get her children out of the car, with her 6-month-old being the last to make it out.\n\nShe said she gave the baby mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while people poured milk on her other children’s eyes because of the tear gas.\n\nJackson said she went to the hospital with her baby and two of her children, who have severe asthma.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis said in a statement the tear gas caused “a 6-month-old infant inside the vehicle to experience breathing difficulties,” according to initial reports.\n\nWhen police and the fire department were able to reach the family, “the infant was breathing and stable, but (in) serious condition,” according to the statement.\n\nAs of Saturday, Jackson and her baby are still dealing with congestion from the tear gas, she said, with her baby taking medication to clear his airways.\n\nCritics are upset that Jackson is collecting money on a GoFundMe after getting tear gassed given her criminal record, she tells CNN.\n\nCourt records show Jackson agreed to plead guilty to “aiding an offender – accomplice after the fact” in June 2021. In the same case, she was also charged with murder, but the charges were later dismissed, according to a court document.\n\nJames Moore, who Jackson says was her boyfriend at the time, was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to intentional second-degree murder in 2020, according to a Hennepin County Attorney’s Office statement.\n\nMoore fatally shot a man who was lured to an apartment to sell marijuana in an apparent robbery gone wrong, the statement says. Moore and another man ran into Jackson’s apartment after the shooting.\n\nA witness said it was Jackson who lured the man by creating a fake Facebook message, according to the statement and a criminal complaint. From there, Moore and another man “had devised a plan to rob (the victim) when he arrived,” the prosecutor’s statement says.\n\nHowever, Jackson was only convicted of “aiding an offender – accomplice after the fact.”\n\n“I had nothing to do with anybody being killed,” Jackson tells CNN, explaining that the accomplice after-the-fact charge was based on the fact that the men fled to her apartment after the killing. Jackson also claims she was not the person to write the Facebook message, explaining she gave her boyfriend access to her account.\n\n“Now that (I’m) an adult and all that stuff, like we don’t share our passwords and stuff with people,” she said.\n\nShe was sentenced to 28 days in jail, which she had already served at the time, and five years of probation, according to court records. She tells CNN she has a few months left of her probation.\n\nShe believes if she had never made a GoFundMe, she doesn’t think so much “negativity” about her story would have surfaced.\n\n“What happened to us was traumatic, you know, in our mind, we feel so guilty … yes, I probably should have left sooner than we did,” she said. “It’s very traumatizing, like the things that we went through and the things that people are saying.”",

    "title": "6 Types of Retirement Income That Won’t Get Taxed",
    "description": "While there are many surprisingly hidden costs in your tax years during retirement, several types of retirement income aren't taxable.",
    "fullText": "One of the most overlooked aspects of retirement planning is the effect that federal income taxes or state income taxes have on someone trying to live on a fixed income. They can take a big bite out of your retirement savings if you’re not prepared.\n\nThe good news for your nest egg is that not all retirement income is taxable. By understanding which sources of income are tax-free in 2026, you can create a smarter retirement strategy and keep more of your hard-earned money. Here are six types of retirement income that won’t get taxed, and how to make the most of them.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid taxes on your retirement money is to use a Roth account. Both IRA and 401(k) plans can be structured as Roth accounts, which don’t offer a tax deduction on contributions but allow tax-free withdrawals after age 59 ½.\n\nEssentially, with a Roth account, you’re paying your taxes upfront at the time that you contribute, rather than owing them on your distributions. While you can’t contribute to a Roth if your income exceeds certain levels, you can convert your traditional plan to a Roth at any time. However, you’ll have to pay income taxes on the amount of the conversion, just as if you withdrew the money.\n\nTrending Now: Here’s What Retirees Wasted the Most Money On in 2025 — and How To Avoid It in 2026\n\nUp Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nFor this reason, it typically makes more sense to start a Roth earlier in your career rather than facing a huge tax bill during your peak earning years. For example, a $1 million portfolio in a 401(k) plan or traditional IRA might be worth $800,000 or less after taxes. Similarly, if your investments are in a regular, taxable brokerage account, the income that money generates may also be taxable.\n\nIt’s not usually a good idea to rely on an inheritance as a retirement plan. For starters, receiving an inheritance is never a sure thing, and additionally, the amount bequeathed is rarely enough to fund a long retirement.\n\nHowever, many Americans do receive an inheritance at some point in their lives, and it can often be a good supplement to existing retirement savings. Financially speaking, the best part of an inheritance is that it is tax-free, so long as you don’t live in Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which still impose inheritance taxes.\n\nThough some states do impose an estate tax, that money will come out of the inheritance and not your personal funds.\n\nMunicipal bonds are issued by states, cities and various localities, generally to fund projects like schools, roads and other items that are for the common good. Municipal bonds are granted tax relief at the federal level, meaning investors don’t have to pay federal taxes on the interest earned from any municipal bond.",

    "fullText": "Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Ca.) declared Sunday he’s “not giving ICE or Border Patrol another dime given how these agencies are operating” as deadly sweeping Immigration and Custom Enforcement raids led by the Trump administration have sparked political and public backlash.\n\nAppearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Schiff made the statement after moderator Kristen Welker asked him if he’s “prepared to vote against Department of Homeland Security funding if it means partially shutting down the government, again, coming on the heels of an incredibly long shutdown.”\n\nPolitics: Democrats Consider Partial Government Shutdown To Curb ICE\n\nTelling Welker straight up that “Democrats are not going to fund that,” he continued, “The government will shut down if Republicans insist that that be joined with other government funding. It will be a Republican decision. They understand we’re not going to go along with this.”\n\nThe California senator noted Democrats are hoping “some of the Republicans in the Senate may see those scenes in the streets and be as repelled as we are, and vote against that continuation of violence also.”\n\nHe added: “If they don’t, it will be their decision whether they couple that funding for these ICE agents and Border Patrol agents with all these other government agencies.”\n\n“[Republicans] will make the decision. They’re in the majority if they want to shut down the government so they can perpetuate this violence,” Schiff said.\n\nPolitics: Sworn Witness Accounts Of Alex Pretti Killing Differ Sharply From DHS\n\nSchiff went on to vow he’s “not going to be a part of it.”\n\n“And I think anyone who votes to give them more money to do this will share in the responsibility and see more Americans die in our cities as a result.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker asked Schiff what the “exact impact” would be if legislators withhold funding now, considering “Republicans have already passed $170 billion in extra DHS funding through what they’ve dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Well, it would certainly, I hope, stop it from becoming even worse,” he responded. “They have thrown so much money at these agencies. They don’t know what to do with it. And there is no question that when we actually get a chance to do oversight again, which I hope will happen after this November, you are going to find all kinds of corruption [with] how that money is going out.”\n\nPolitics: House Passes Bill Funding ICE — With Help From Democrats\n\nSchiff then told Welker he believes they will find that the money has been “wasted hand over fist.”\n\n“There is going to be enormous waste, fraud and abuse in DHS given how money is being spent without any kind of real oversight,” he said.\n\nWatch Schiff’s interview on “Meet the Press” below.\n\nTrump Takes Aim At ‘Corrupt’ Adam Schiff As Next Target In His Political Retribution Tour\n\nAdam Schiff Calls Out Trump For 'Flip-Flopping' On Abortion\n\nRep.

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian authorities unveiled a new mural on a giant billboard in a central Tehran square on Sunday with a direct warning to the United States to not attempt a military strike on the country, as U.S. warships head to the region.\n\nThe image shows a bird's-eye view of an aircraft carrier with damaged and exploding fighter planes on its flight deck. The deck is strewn with bodies and streaked with blood that trails into the water behind the ship to form a pattern reminiscent of the stripes of the American flag. A slogan is emblazoned across one corner: “If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind.”\n\nThe unveiling of the mural in Enghelab Square comes as the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and accompanying warships move toward the region. U.S. President Donald Trump has said the ships are being moved “just in case” he decides to take action.\n\n“We have a massive fleet heading in that direction and maybe we won’t have to use it,” Trump said Thursday.\n\nEnghelab Square is used for gatherings called by the state and authorities change its mural based on national occasions. On Saturday, the commander of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard warned that his force is “more ready than ever, finger on the trigger.”\n\nTension between the U.S. and Iran has spiked in the wake of a brutal crackdown on nationwide protests that saw thousands of people killed and tens of thousands arrested. Trump had threatened military action if Iran continued to kill peaceful protesters or carried out mass executions of those detained.\n\nThere have been no further protests for days and Trump claimed recently that Tehran had halted the planned execution of about 800 arrested protesters — a claim Iran’s top prosecutor called “completely false.”\n\nBut Trump has indicated he is keeping his options open, saying on Thursday that any military action would make last June’s U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites “look like peanuts.”\n\nU.S. Central Command said on social media that its Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle now has a presence in the Middle East, noting the fighter jet “enhances combat readiness and promotes regional security and stability.”\n\nSimilarly, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said Thursday that it deployed its Typhoon fighter jets to Qatar “in a defensive capacity.”\n\nThe protests in Iran began on Dec. 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, which does not tolerate dissent.\n\nThe death toll reported by activists has continued to rise since the end of the demonstrations, as information trickles out despite a more than two-week internet blackout — the most comprehensive in Iran’s history.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Sunday put the death toll at 5,848, with the number expected to increase. It says more than 41,280 people have been arrested.\n\nThe group’s figures have been accurate in previous unrest and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Associated Press has not been able to independently verify the toll.\n\nIran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest “terrorists.” In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

    "description": "Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin says he thinks Franklin County has never seen a real level 3 snow emergency before.",
    "fullText": "Franklin County Sheriff Dallas Baldwin said the level 3 snow emergency declared Jan. 25 appears to be the first in the county's history, and it could continue into Jan. 26.\n\nBaldwin told The Dispatch that the roads in Franklin County are closed to all except emergency personnel and people who must travel for essential work, including hospital and airport employees.\n\nOngoing extreme cold temperatures will make road treatments less effective, so it's possible the level 3 snow emergency could remain in place for a while, Baldwin said.\n\n\"The roads are white,\" Baldwin said in an interview with the Dispatch at 12:30 p.m. Jan. 25. \"They're totally snow covered. Some of the roads are not bad ... Some are just absolutely horrible.\"\n\nBaldwin's office later issued a press release clarifying the level 3 status.\n\n\"This is not an automatic enforcement action in which drivers are stopped and cited simply for being onthe road,\" the release said. \"Deputies and police officers use discretion when encountering motorists. Those who have a legitimate and necessary reason to travel should not fear immediate citation or arrest. However, individuals traveling without an acceptable reason during a Level 3 Snow Emergency may be subject to arrest.\"\n\nBaldwin said he doesn't believe a level 3 snow emergency has been called in Franklin County before. He said this is because Franklin County has \"so many resources\" and is usually able to clear roads quickly.\n\nThe sheriff's office later clarified that in the early 2000s, former Sheriff Jim Karnes accidentally declared a level 3 emergency due to a miscommunication.\n\nBaldwin placed the county under a level 3 snow emergency at 11:37 a.m. Jan 25. Snow emergencies are set by local sheriffs and remain in place until they are lifted.\n\nBaldwin said he will lift the emergency when he has heard from the Ohio Department of Transportation and the city that the roads are safe.\n\nBaldwin said he was out driving on the roads the morning of Jan. 25. As noon approached, he saw more and more regular vehicles out, and some of them were struggling in the snow.\n\n\"If the regular motorists can't get by, then the snowplows can't get by,\" Baldwin said. \"If they can't get by, the fire trucks, our cruisers can't respond.\"\n\nBaldwin said the level 3 snow emergency will remain in place until the main roads in the county are cleared. It's difficult to say how long that will take because snow is still coming down, he added. The National Weather Service forecasts snow into the night, with flurries still possible after 10 p.m.\n\n\"If we're just able to stay off of the road and let the snowplows do their job, then we can all get back on the road quicker,\" Baldwin said.\n\nBaldwin said the main purpose of the snow emergency is to keep people off the roads who do not need to be traveling. He hopes central Ohioans heed the emergency's warning.\n\n\"The main message is to keep people safe. Just stay home and enjoy the day,\" Baldwin said.\n\nPublic Safety and Breaking News Reporter Bailey Gallion can be reached at bagallion@dispatch.com.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Is it legal to drive during level 3 snow emergency in Franklin County?",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is calling for the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, saying that she believes Noem is attempting to \"mislead the American public” about the fatal shooting of a 37 year-old protester in Minneapolis.\n\nThe call from Rosen, a moderate from Nevada who was part of the group that helped Republicans end the 43-day government shutdown last year, comes amid a growing fury from congressional Democrats who have also vowed to block funding for the Homeland Security Department. A House resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against Noem has the support of more than 100 Democrats, but few Senate Democrats have so far weighed in.\n\n“Kristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year — and the abuses of power we’re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Rosen said in a statement to The Associated Press.\n\nRosen said Noem's conduct is “deeply shameful” and she \"must be impeached and removed from office immediately.”\n\nImpeachment proceedings are unlikely in the GOP-controlled Congress, but mounting Democratic outrage over the violence in the streets of Minneapolis is certain to disrupt Senate Republican leaders’ hopes this week to quickly approve a wide-ranging spending bill and avoid a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30.\n\nAnd while some moderate Democrats have been wary over the last year of criticizing the Trump administration on border and immigration issues, the fatal shootings in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7 have transformed the debate, even among moderates like Rosen.\n\nThe senator's call for impeachment followed Noem’s quick defense, without a full investigation, of the fatal shooting of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti as he “approached” them with a gun. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but he appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos.\n\nDuring the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and opened fire with several shots, including into his back. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon.\n\nNoem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”\n\n“This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” Noem said Sunday.\n\nIn her call for Noem's impeachment, Rosen cited other issues beyond the current ICE operations. She said Noem has also “violated the public trust by wasting millions in taxpayer dollars” on self promotion and cited reports that the Coast Guard purchased her two luxury jets worth $172 million.\n\nRosen’s statement follows that of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is one of the more left-leaning members of the Senate Democratic caucus. Markey said last week that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against Noem, “who is right now actually orchestrating on the streets of our country this almost vigilantism on the part of ICE agents terrorizing cities all across the country.”\n\nAnd while other senators stopped short of calling for Noem's impeachment, several moderate Democrats who joined Rosen in voting to reopen the government last year said they would vote against Homeland Security funding this week even if it meant a government shutdown.\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that DHS is “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.\" Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said that “we are not living in normal times.”\n\nAs administration officials immediately defended the shooting, several Republicans have called for a thorough investigation, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.\n\nHouse Democrats increasingly back Noem's impeachment\n\nCalls for Noem’s impeachment also grew louder in the House as the Democratic caucus had a phone call with Minnesota’s Gov. Tim Walz and the state’s Attorney General Keith Ellison, both former congressmen, according to a person familiar with the private call who requested anonymity to discuss it.\n\nMost of the House Democratic lawmakers who spoke during the meeting called for Noem's impeachment, said another person familiar with the call who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.\n\nNew York Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat who was one of only seven House Democrats who voted to fund the Homeland Security Department last week, said Sunday that “there must be accountability, which is why Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately.”\n\n“She is not focused on safety or border security; she’s focused on chaos and self-promotion, undermining local law enforcement and stoking violence as a result,” Gillen said in a post on X.\n\nAP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Just 254 days ago Crystal Palace were flying high.\n\nCaptain Marc Guehi held the FA Cup aloft at Wembley - the club's first major trophy after upsetting Manchester City in the final - and Oliver Glasner was already making plans for a European campaign.\n\nBut so much has changed since that glorious afternoon.\n\nMatch-winner Eberechi Eze was sold to Arsenal in the summer, Guehi moved to Manchester City, while Glasner himself announced he will be leaving when his contract expires at the end of the season and talisman Jean-Philippe Mateta told the club he wants to leave.\n\nResults have also taken a downward turn, with Palace failing to win any of their past 11 games across all competitions - the longest current winless run of any Premier League side - including losing at non-league Macclesfield in the FA Cup.\n\nSunday's 3-1 home loss by Chelsea extended their winless league run to eight matches, with six ending in defeat, and left them 15th in the table and eight points clear of third-bottom West Ham.\n\nPalace ended the match with 10 men after midfielder Adam Wharton - another player linked with an exit - was sent off after receiving two yellow cards.\n\n\"Confidence is what you get from results,\" Glasner told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"It is my job, my responsibility, with my staff, my group, to get this confidence back. I saw a lot of positives, but when you are losing 3-1 and have not won for 11 games then it's completely right to say, 'where are the results?'\n\n\"That's what we have to get. It is up to us to find these puzzle pieces. There's no magician. I always believe in this group, these players, that we will turn it around.\"\n\nDespite Palace's poor form, they are still one point better off than at this stage last season and can book a spot in the last 16 of the Conference League if they come through a two-legged play-off against Zrinjski Mostar from Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\n\"These are tough moments, tough games,\" added Glasner.\n\n\"I look at the team and 3-0 down, a red card, you can go out five or six-nil, but we came back, scored a goal and made a fight of it, so that shows the great character of the group and that gives me a lot of confidence this group will turn it around.\"",

    "fullText": "When Tomas Cvancara stretched his neck and planted a header on Craig Gordon's crossbar an hour into this exhilarating clash of the champions and the wannabe champions, a sense of shock swept around Tynecastle.\n\nCvancara? Was he still out there? You could have been forgiven for thinking not. For an hour he'd been little more than a keen if ill-fitting presence in the Celtic attack.\n\nHis lack of goal threat was hardly a surprise given he has scored just three times in the 43 games he had played before this one. His lack of impact was no great sensation either given he hadn't played a competitive minute since late November.\n\nThe fact he was still on the pitch was a little odd because the game had passed him by, but that header showed there was life in the new boy.\n\nMore life than Hearts had bargained for. Minutes later, he tore away down the left, leaving Craig Halkett trailing behind. His delivery to Yang Hyun-jun was precise and against the flow of the game Celtic were back in front.\n\nTynecastle rubbed its eyes and then girded its loins. In those seconds, a compelling game became a total belter; thrilling, controversial, exhausting and invigorating.\n\nGoals, aggravation, a red card that infuriated the visitors and opened a door for the hosts, a toe-to-toe fight that went to the wire.\n\nIt wasn't so much the bitter cold that caused the shivers at Tynecastle, it was the mad drama of the clash, the intensity and edge-of-the-seat fury of it all.",

Since then, both clubs have been relegated to and returned from the Championship - and this term both are chasing European glory.\n\nNewcastle are seventh in the league phase of the Champions League. Villa have already secured a place in the Europa League last 16.\n\nHowever, after losing by an aggregate score of 12-1 on their past three trips to St James' Park, Villa's 2-0 success this time around underlined the progress made under boss Unai Emery.\n\nThe result keeps Villa, who bounced back from last Sunday's loss to Everton by adding this win to Thursday's Europa League victory away to Fenerbahce, third in the table and firmly in the title race, just four points behind leaders Arsenal.\n\nAnd Emery was insistent that his players had delivered a \"complete\" performance.\n\n\"The players were extraordinary,\" the Spaniard told BBC Match of the Day.\n\n\"We spoke about this match and the difficulties some teams have with their level here. It is the highest level we can face this season and the players respond fantastic.\n\n\"We can only help the players tactically. Out on the field, they need to show the attitude and commitment to work to the gameplan and they did it.\n\n\"Last week we lost and were so disappointed but we can be calm again and have confidence.

But given the collective noise being made by the 3,000-strong visiting support, they probably were.\n\nMinority United owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe looked pleased enough in the directors' box. There have not been many moments to smile about in the two years he has been running the football side at Old Trafford. This certainly was one.\n\nUnited have marked Carrick's first two matches in charge with successive wins. It was something Ruben Amorim managed once in his 14-month tenure - as part of a run of three successes earlier this season that earned him the October manager of the month award.\n\nUnited have amassed six points under Carrick. It took Amorim five games to get to seven - and he lost the next three matches.\n\nUnited have taken twice as many points from their past two games - against the teams first and second in the table - as they collected from the three before that, against Leeds, Wolves and Burnley, three of the current bottom five.\n\nSix weeks ago, hardly anyone would have chosen Carrick as United's next manager in preference to Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner.",

    "fullText": "Ted Cruz trashed President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance in conversations with GOP donors last year, explosive leaked recordings allege.\n\nThe Texas senator, expected to run for president in 2028, slammed Trump’s tariff crusade and said he even threatened his staff with immediate firing if they used the phrase “Liberation Day” to refer to the day the sweeping taxes were announced, reports Axios.\n\nCruz, 55, told donors he and other senators expressed their tariff disgust with Trump in a lengthy phone call, warning it would tank the economy and lead to his impeachment. The call pushed past midnight and “did not go well,” Cruz told donors, with Trump “yelling” and “cursing” at the lawmakers.\n\nCruz claims that he received an especially explicit response from the president that night.\n\n“Mr. President, if we get to November of [2026] and people’s 401(k)s are down 30% and prices are up 10–20% at the supermarket, we’re going to go into Election Day, face a bloodbath,” Cruz told Trump, according to the recording. “You’re going to lose the House, you’re going to lose the Senate, you’re going to spend the next two years being impeached every single week.”\n\nTrump allegedly responded bluntly: “‘F--- you, Ted.’”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCruz’s office did not deny the contents of the recordings in a statement to Axios. Still, Cruz’s office claimed that he is still “the president’s greatest ally in the Senate and battles every day in the trenches to advance his agenda.”\n\nAxios reports that the recordings were “nearly 10 minutes in total” and came from conversations in “early and middle 2025.” The site said the recordings were provided by a “Republican source.”\n\nIt is unclear which donors Cruz was speaking to.\n\nTrump referred to Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted” in the 2016 GOP presidential primary and even went as far as suggesting that his wife, Heidi, is ugly compared to Melania. Still, Cruz has largely done Trump’s bidding in the Senate ever since, and he even campaigned for him in 2024.\n\nCruz, 55, is now believed to be eyeing another White House run, hoping to become a more traditional GOP successor to Trumpism. Standing in his way is the 41-year-old Vance, who is the overwhelming favorite to win the Republican nomination in the eyes of prediction markets.\n\nVance was “torched” by Cruz in the secret recordings, Axios reported. Sources also told The Washington Post last month that Cruz privately badmouths the VP to donors.\n\nIn the recordings obtained by Axios, Cruz claimed that Vance was a “pawn of conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson,” who is among Cruz’s biggest foes, having clashed with the ex-Fox News host in an explosive interview last summer over the Trump administration’s strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Cruz supported the intervention and has repeatedly criticized Carlson for his opposition to U.S. military support of Israel.\n\n“Tucker created JD,” Cruz told donors, according to Axios. “JD is Tucker’s protégé, and they are one and the same.”\n\nPublicly, Cruz has never explicitly linked Vance and Carlson. He alleged to donors that the ousted National Security Adviser Mike Waltz—of Signalgate infamy—was pushed out of Trump’s Cabinet by Carlson and Vance.\n\n“[He] supported being vigorous against Iran and bombing Iran—and Tucker and JD took Mike out,” Cruz said, according to Axios.\n\nCarlson told Axios he had nothing to do with the high-profile ouster.",

    "fullText": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that a U.S. security guarantees document for Ukraine is “100% ready” after two days of talks involving representatives from Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Vilnius during a visit to Lithuania, Zelenskyy said Ukraine is waiting for its partners to set a signing date, after which the document would go to the U.S. Congress and Ukrainian parliament for ratification.\n\nZelenskyy also emphasized Ukraine’s push for European Union membership by 2027, calling it an “economic security guarantee.”\n\nThe Ukrainian leader described the talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as likely the first trilateral format in “quite a long while” that included not only diplomats but military representatives from all three sides. The talks, which began on Friday and continued Saturday, were the latest aiming to end Russia’s nearly four-year full-scale invasion.\n\nZelenskyy acknowledged fundamental differences between Ukrainian and Russian positions, reaffirming territorial issues as a major sticking point.\n\n“Our position regarding our territory — Ukraine’s territorial integrity — must be respected,” he said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed a Ukraine settlement with U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner during marathon talks late Thursday. The Kremlin insisted that to reach a peace deal, Kyiv must withdraw its troops from the areas in the east that Russia illegally annexed but has not fully captured.\n\nZelenskyy said the U.S. is trying to find a compromise, but that “all sides must be ready for compromise.”\n\nNegotiators will return to the UAE on Feb. 1 for the next round of talks, according to a U.S. official. The recent talks covered a broad range of military and economic matters and included the possibility of a ceasefire before a deal, the official said. There was not yet an agreement on a final framework for oversight and operation of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is occupied by Russia and is the largest in Europe.",

    "fullText": "Even though companies always want to avoid costly recalls, they are an unavoidable reality. There are now certain models of Toyota Tundra trucks that have become the subject of a nationwide safety recall that drivers should be aware of.\n\nOn January 23, 2026, the Toyota Newsroom website revealed that there was a voluntary safety recall for certain Tundra and Tundra Hybrid 2024 and 2025 models. The company stated that approximately 162,000 vehicles in the United States will be affected. Owners are set to be notified of the recall by late March 2026. The announcement included the following description of the issue that necessitated a fix.\n\n\"Under certain circumstances, the multimedia display may become stuck on a camera view or display a black image in the subject vehicles. If this occurs, the rearview image may not be displayed while the vehicle is being reversed. In this case, the vehicle may not meet a federal safety standard, and there can be an increased risk of a crash with a person behind the vehicle.\"\n\nFortunately for owners, the company described a simple fix that will be provided at no charge. \"For all involved vehicles, dealers will update the Parking Assist ECU software, free of charge.\"\n\nIn the automotive industry, there is very little that is as important as being reliable. On December 4, 2025, Consumer Reports published the findings of its 2026 Automotive Brand Report Card, which named Toyota as the most reliable brand overall. The consumer advocate company's website described the methodology they used to conclude that Toyota should get the highest rank.\n\n“The latest Consumer Reports Annual Auto Reliability Surveys gathered information from car owners on about 380,000 vehicles from model years 2000 to 2025 and early 2026. The survey covers up to 20 problem areas, including engine, electric motors, transmission, in-car electronics, and more. CR’s team of statisticians, researchers, and testers analyzed trouble areas and created an overall reliability score for each model and year. Serious problem areas that can lead to expensive repairs are more heavily weighted. Reliability predictions for 2026 models are based on each model’s overall reliability for the past three years, provided that the model hasn’t been redesigned during that time. If there is insufficient data on a model in any given model year, CR uses the brand reliability score to supplement that model’s new car prediction. The survey gathered information from car owners each year about problems they had with their vehicles in the past 12 months.”",

    "fullText": "The unshakeable influence of the Kardashians over the past decade has led to a rise in women trying to achieve the perfect, round derrière. But strong buttocks aren’t just an aesthetic goal – they have now also been recognised as an important indicator of our overall health.\n\n“The gluteus maximus is the powerhouse of all human movement,” says Dr Marjola Thanaj, a research fellow at the University of Westminster. “It’s a key trait that sets us apart from other primates.”\n\nA new study, led by Dr Thanaj, has revealed that the shape of the gluteus maximus muscles, found deep in our buttocks, can offer an early warning sign of the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nA team of researchers at the University of Westminster used more than 60,000 MRI scans, collected by the UK Biobank project, to study the shifts in the muscles caused by age, lifestyle and the onset of disease. These were combined with lifestyle and health data for each individual.\n\nThe results showed that the muscles of men and women changed in markedly different ways, as each gender edged closer to developing Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn men, there was a thinning of the gluteus maximus in specific regions – in some areas by as much as a quarter – giving it a more hollowed profile on scans. By contrast, the muscle appeared larger in women – deceptively, as this change was actually caused by fat infiltrating the muscle.\n\n“The findings suggest the gluteus maximus is a good indicator of metabolic health,” says Dr Thanaj.\n\nIt’s possible to spot clues in different bottom shapes that are likely to reflect the underlying health and function of the gluteus maximus muscle. Here are five common shapes and what they signify.\n\nWith fat evenly distributed in the upper and lower part of the buttocks, this shape is seen as highly desirable in women, reflected in the popularity of the “Brazilian bum lift”. In men, it is often associated with fitness and virility.\n\n“A round bottom could indicate good glute muscle mass and a good distribution of muscle and fat around the whole of the glutes,” says Dr Henry Chung, a lecturer in physiology at the University of Essex’s School of Sport, Rehabilitation and Exercise Sciences. “Because the bottom is more filled out, this could mean there is more muscle, which means more strength and stability.”\n\n“People with round bottoms are likely to have good lower body strength,” agrees Kate Rowe-Ham, a personal trainer and the author of the health and fitness book for midlife women, Owning Your Menopause. “They might be doing activities such as lifting weights, sprinting and climbing.”\n\nFullest at the bottom and tapering in near the waistline, this shape – most commonly seen in women – is also associated with health.\n\n“Women often dislike being pear-shaped, which means they have a tendency to hold their fat around their bottom and thighs, but it’s far healthier than carrying fat in the middle of your body, around your organs,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nOverall size and tone matters, but if the buttocks are pert, rather than saggy, it’s a good sign. “This shape is a sign of better metabolic health compared to most of the others, showing strong mid-to-lower glutes and thighs,” says Dr Chung.\n\nThis shape has more mass in the upper portion of the bottom, with very little where it meets the thighs. It is common in post-menopausal women due to hormonal changes.\n\n“As women age and lose muscle, fat distribution can also shift from the bottom and thighs to the abdomen,” says Rowe-Ham. “They can find fat gathering around the hips and top of their bottom, creating ‘love handles’.”\n\nThis shape, which lacks volume, suggests weaker lower glutes and thighs, says Dr Chung.\n\nFlat across the hips and glutes, lacking fullness at either the top or lower part of the gluteus maximus, this shape can be seen in men or women – although it’s generally more pronounced in men due to their lack of hormone-driven fat around their hips and buttocks.\n\nIt often suggests a tendency to store fat around the middle or love handles, and can also imply reduced gluteal muscle volume or activity. “If that’s the case, it could result in lower overall lower-body strength, reduced hip and trunk stability and an increased load on the lower back and knees,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nBoth men and women tend to lose mass in their gluteus maximus, along with skin elasticity and firmness, as they age. Flatter, saggier bottoms that have a deflated look are common, regardless of people’s weight. “I often see this even in very slim people,” says Rowe-Ham. “They might look great in clothes, but if they’re not exercising to maintain muscle mass they’re not future-proofing their bodies.”\n\n“Flat bottoms tend to mean weaker glutes, which can lead to issues such as back, knee or hip pain,” says Dr Chung. Poor posture, reduced mobility and lower strength are also potential issues.\n\nAs the largest muscle in the body, the gluteus maximus drives forward propulsion, stabilises the pelvis and trunk and enables us to walk, run, climb and rise from a seated to a standing position with efficiency and control.\n\nIt also plays a major role in how well we process and use energy – if we’re not doing so efficiently, it can lead to conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and cardiovascular disease.\n\n“Large muscles, like the gluteus, act almost like ‘engines’ of the body,” explains Dr Thanaj. “The healthier and stronger these muscles are, the better the body can manage blood sugar, store and burn fuel and support healthy ageing.”\n\nAlthough the new study suggested that Type 2 diabetes triggers different responses in men and women to the structure of their gluteus maximus, in both cases, there was a reduction of healthy muscle tissue.\n\nDr Chung explains that maintaining muscle in our bottoms is particularly important, as it is the main site for glucose uptake in the body. “More muscle means more glucose being absorbed and stored, which then lowers blood sugar levels,” he says.\n\n“Increasing muscle also increases resting metabolic rate – the calories burnt at rest – whereas having more fat does the opposite and decreases metabolic efficiency.”\n\nHe adds that this area of the body is also “massively linked with bodily movement and longevity – more muscle means slower ageing and the ability to keep lifting things, walking upstairs, balancing and much more for longer”.\n\nSeveral factors affect the shape and size of our bottoms, including our overall weight, which is influenced by the calories we consume and the amount of exercise we do.\n\n“Genetics, pelvic width, hip bone shape and where a person stores fat also play a huge role,” says Dr Chung. Women are biologically predisposed to store more fat around the hips and buttocks to support fertility, pregnancy and lactation, while men tend to have a higher proportion of lean muscle in the gluteal region, due to testosterone, strength and propulsion.\n\nMost of the fat we can see in this area will be subcutaneous, which is far less harmful than visceral fat found around the organs, linked to a higher risk of conditions including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke and certain cancers.\n\n“However, intramuscular fat, deeper fat that infiltrates the muscles, reduces muscle efficiency and has a negative impact on metabolic health,” says Dr Chung.\n\nAgeing, inactivity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity are linked to higher levels of this type of fat, but exercise – particularly resistance training – helps reduce it.\n\n“Targeting the glutes is essential as we age, as strong muscles act as an anchor for the whole body so we can continue to run, jump, react to falls, maintain good balance and more,” says Dr Chung.\n\n“Take more frequent breaks to get moving,” he says. Ideally, we should aim to stand up and move every 30-60 minutes.\n\n“Elevate your heels slightly with a rolled-up mat or towel, which will help you get deeper into the squat and really target the glutes,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\nLie on your side, with your hand tucked under your head and knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Lift your top knee towards the ceiling like a clamshell opening, keeping hips stable and feet touching, and slowly lower back down. “It engages the glutes and also strengthens and stabilises the hips and core,” says Rowe-Ham.\n\n“Climb the stairs, or hills, or go hiking – find something that’s a bit more advanced than just walking,” says Dr Chung. This type of exercise will strengthen your leg muscles and give your entire cardiovascular system a workout as well as your glutes.\n\nTightening the buttocks for five seconds 10-15 times a day will activate and strengthen the muscles.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Chris Palmer, who went missing with his dog in the Outer Banks in North Carolina, is believed to be dead after his belongings were found along the coastline\n\nThe 39-year-old had gone to the Smoky Mountains to camp before he told his family signal was too spotty to stay in contact\n\nHis family has since shared that they “recently learned that Christopher was facing a terminal illness”\n\nA hiker, who went missing with his dog in the Outer Banks in North Carolina, is believed to be dead after his belongings were found.\n\nTwo weeks after Chris Palmer, 39, went missing in North Carolina, his father, Bren Palmer, shared on social media that he and his family made the “difficult decision” to put a stop to all active search efforts for his son.\n\n“We recently learned that Christopher was facing a terminal illness,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 24. “Knowing this has helped us understand the choices he made. Christopher loved the outdoors and valued his independence. The treatments ahead would have taken much of that away, and he did not want that future for himself.”\n\nNoting that Chris’s belongings were discovered near the coastline, Bren said that their family believes he “perished in the sea.”\n\n“As heartbreaking as this is, we have found a measure of peace in that understanding,” he continued. “We are deeply proud of the man Christopher was, and we hope his story brings awareness to the emotional and mental burdens people can face during serious medical challenges.”\n\n“We would like to thank the United Cajun Navy and every volunteer, first responder, and community member who searched for our son,” he added. “It has been profoundly humbling to see so many people care for someone they never met. Our family is at peace and asks that Christopher’s memory and the safety of others be respected as we seek closure.”\n\nThe update comes eight days after Chris was officially declared missing with his dog after a truck belonging to him was found on a North Carolina beach on Jan. 12, three days after he last made contact with his family, according to the National Park Service.\n\nIn a Jan. 20 news release, officials said, “Palmer is believed to be traveling with his German shepherd and may still be in the area.”\n\nTwo days later, the NPS shared in an update that, after reviewing Dare County traffic camera footage, investigators believe Palmer’s truck was in Dare County as early as the afternoon of Jan. 9. While it was not there when the vehicle was found on the beach, footage showed that there was a blue and white kayak in the back of the vehicle at the time.\n\nBren shared on Jan. 19 that his son went to the Smoky Mountains with his dog Zoey to camp 11 days prior.\n\n“He does alot of camping in the national forests,” he explained on Facebook. “He lets us know when and where he is going and when he is expected to return.”\n\nWhile he had received frequent communications from Chris up until Jan. 9, Bren noted that his son had told him that signal became too spotty to talk the day before his truck was found abandoned on the beach “hours away in the opposite direction he was headed.”\n\n“The National Park Service are currently searching for him with teams and infrared drones near  buxton,” he wrote at the time. “Im [sic] asking for prayers that he is found safe and send this to friends you might know in the mention areas.”",

    "description": "Tom Cruise has reportedly left the staff at his $47 million London apartment \"stunned\" by his abrupt departure from the UK.",
    "fullText": "Tom Cruise has reportedly left the staff at his $47 million London apartment \"stunned\" by his abrupt departure from the UK.\n\nA source revealed that the actor, who once declared himself an \"Anglophile,\" made the decision to leave for the US \"very quickly,\" describing the move as \"strange.\"\n\nThis comes a few weeks after it was revealed that Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology had \"angered\" locals of East Grinstead with their disruptions while attending fundraisers in England.\n\nCruise has made an abrupt decision to move back to the US after spending years in the UK, where he was sometimes seen enjoying pub outings and even hanging out with the future king, Prince William.\n\nAccording to a source who spoke with the Mail on Sunday, staff were left \"stunned\" by his sudden departure, with some spotted removing boxes of possessions at the \"Mission Impossible\" star's £35 million [$47 million] London penthouse property, which overlooks Hyde Park.\n\nWhile the reason for his move is currently unclear, a source noted that it happened \"very quickly\" and seemingly out of the blue.\n\nSpeaking with the news outlet, the source said, \"Tom loved London. He loved where he lived; he would get up and go for [a] run around Hyde Park in the mornings. He loved walking in the local area, but he also really, really enjoyed jumping in a helicopter at Battersea Heliport and flying off into the quintessentially British countryside.\"\n\nThe source continued, \"It all happened very quickly; it was a surprise to the staff at the building where his penthouse is. It's most strange. The UK became both his professional headquarters and private playground, with discrete dates, tightly-guarded movements, and late-night arrivals.\"\n\n\"England became far more than just a filming base,\" they added about Cruise's sudden exit.\n\nBefore Cruise's decision to seemingly return to the US, he had become very well known for his love of the UK, where he had been making films for over 40 years.\n\nLast year, the actor was recognized for his contribution to the UK film industry and was awarded a BFI fellowship by the British Film Institute.\n\nAt the event held in May, Cruise noted, \"I'm truly honoured, I've been making films in the UK for over 40 years and have no plans to stop.\"\n\nBack in 2022, the actor also labeled himself an \"Anglophile\" because he spent a lot of \"time in Britain, and that's not just for work reasons.\"\n\n\"I just love being here,\" he stated at the time, per the Daily Mail. \"It's a fantastic blend of old and new... Britain is trendy, too, and has a lot that other countries then copy. I also love the British countryside.\"\n\nCruise was also said to have been interested in buying some properties in the Cotswolds, as he hoped to strengthen his ties to the UK, making his sudden departure, which reportedly included him removing his blackout curtains from his penthouse, even more puzzling.\n\nCruise, who has somewhat become the face of the Church of Scientology because of his vocal support over the years, recently came under fire after locals made complaints about him and his organization.\n\nThe actor makes it a point of duty to attend the Church's annual fundraiser in England. However, last year's edition in December allegedly \"angered\" residents of East Grinstead because of the disruption it brought to their everyday lives.\n\nThe small town located in West Sussex is home to the British headquarters of the Church and often receives guests in large numbers when such events are happening.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, former Scientologist Alexander Barnes-Ross said that the locals are \"extremely frustrated and angered\" by the instant increase in population during the fundraiser, and were particularly uncomfortable with the disturbance caused by Cruise \"flying in on his helicopter.\"\n\n\"It causes a lot of noise and nuisance, and he [Tom Cruise], you know, doesn't stop for photos or anything,\" Barnes-Ross shared.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, a resident described the Church's order of proceedings right from the preparation stages as \"very disruptive.\"\n\n\"For six to eight weeks, they were laying down pallets in the field to make a car park, so we had the disruption and noise of that, with lorry after lorry coming,\" the unidentified local said of Cruise's Church.\n\nDuring the event proper, more of such chaos would follow as the Church uses generators to power heavy equipment and also plays loud musical instruments.\n\nReports suggest the community feels \"helpless\" as to what they'll do, as some town leaders also attend the Church and have a good relationship with the organization.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, locals have since filed a complaint with the Mid Sussex District Council, noting that the event attended by Cruise and other high-profile church members causes \"considerable disruptions\" to the area.\n\nIt allegedly brings about traffic congestion and noise pollution. The complaint would see the Church's premises license undergo a review.\n\nIf the local community wins, the Church could be asked to tone down the large scale of events it organizes or implement measures to protect vulnerable people.",

    "description": "‘Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm,’ the former Georgia congresswoman wrote",
    "fullText": "Marjorie Taylor Greene has urged fellow MAGA supporters – and other Americans – to “take off their political blinders” over the death of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, warning that they are being “incited into civil war.”\n\n“I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement,” Greene wrote on X Sunday, the day after the fatal shooting. “However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment.\n\n“Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.”\n\nDespite video showing that 37-year-old Pretti was filming federal officers but did not have a weapon drawn, the Trump administration has claimed he had tried to assassinate agents in an act of “domestic terrorism.”\n\nThe incident was captured from multiple angles, including one that showed Pretti being sprayed with mace and wrestled to the ground while attempting to help a woman who had just been sprayed herself and had fallen to the ground. After being swarmed by around seven officers a shot rings out, followed by at least nine more, and Pretti falls still.\n\n“There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing,” Greene said.\n\nThe former Congresswoman asked MAGA to consider another scenario in which she replaced the protesters in Minnesota with those who supported the action on January 6, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\n“We lost our minds when we watched Biden’s FBI track down and aggressively carry out home invasions and arrest… peaceful J6’ers who walked in the Capitol through open doors,” she said.\n\n“Imaging [sic] if one of our MAGA independent journalists or even just a MAGA supporter stood in the street outside a J6’ers house while Biden’s FBI carried out a law enforcement operation, home invasion, and arrest.\n\n“Then Biden’s FBI goes to the MAGA guy videoing it all and shoves a woman with him to the ground and sprays them with bear spray then throws the MAGA guy to the ground as MAGA guy was trying to help the woman off the ground. Then Biden’s FBI beats MAGA guy on the ground, disarms MAGA guy, and then shoots him dead.\n\n“What would have been our reaction? Both sides need to take off their political blinders. You are all being incited into civil war, yet none of it solves any of the real problems that we all face, and tragically people are dying.”\n\nPretti’s death is the second fatal shooting to involve federal agents in Minneapolis in less than three weeks, following the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on January 7. Tensions and clashes between demonstrators have increased, as well as those between state and federal authorities.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said earlier Sunday that residents, as well as his own police department have “had enough.”\n\n“This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This has taken an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of trying to be the police department for a major city,” O’Hara told CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday.\n\nO’Hara noted that he has received no official information from the federal government related to Saturday’s shooting. “Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting,” he said.\n\nWhile the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was blocked from the scene of the shooting Saturday by federal officials, they were allowed access Sunday to canvas for witnesses.\n\nGreene’s comments represent the latest instance of her breaking from MAGA orthodoxy. Previously a firebrand Trump loyalist, she has publicly broken from the president in recent months over issues including the Epstein files and foreign policy. She stood down from Congress earlier this month.",
