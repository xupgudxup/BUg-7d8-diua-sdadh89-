    "description": "Russell is currently favourite for the 2026 Formula 1 title with Mercedes coming out of last week's Barcelona shakedown looking the strongest",
    "fullText": "Formula 1 2026 world championship favourite George Russell is confident Mercedes has produced a strong car for the upcoming season - but refused to declare it a potential title contender.\n\nThis year, F1 will introduce a whole new set of regulations with changes to both the chassis and power unit and as everything is new, the pecking order is currently a guessing game.\n\nBut expectations are high at Mercedes, considering the Silver Arrows dominated the last engine switch in 2014 by winning the next eight championships, while it also enjoyed a strong Barcelona shakedown last week.\n\nIt completed the most mileage of any team and Russell’s team-mate Andrea Kimi Antonelli even conducted a full race simulation, causing engineering director Andrew Shovlin to claim “I don’t think we could have hoped for a better three days of testing”.\n\nThis has led to Russell topping the odds for this year’s title, especially after his strongest season yet in 2025 with fourth in the standings and to many, being the best driver behind Max Verstappen.\n\nBut he is still wary of his rivals with two official Bahrain tests to come before the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on 6-8 March.\n\n“Obviously we've only driven the car for three days and it's still very early days, but it doesn't look like it's a turd, which is a bonus,” said the five-time grand prix winner at the Mercedes 2026 launch on Monday.\n\n“To be honest, in the early days like this, you know when it could be a really bad car and you can highlight those negatives early on, we don't believe it is. But is it a car that can produce a world championship? It's still way too early to see.\n\n“We've been quite surprised by what we've seen from some of our rivals, especially on the Red Bull power unit side, that looks very impressive considering they're a completely new outfit and reliable as well.\n\n“So kudos to them. We've had a very reliable test, but we'll have to wait and see if the car lives up to the expectation.”\n\nThe situation marks a far cry from 2022 when ground-effect cars were introduced for Russell’s debut season at Mercedes, whose dominance was ended with the last rule switch.\n\nFour years ago, the German marque produced a very unpredictable car that endured vast porpoising and this made it hard for Mercedes to recover, as the subsequent titles went to Red Bull or McLaren.\n\nBut now, Russell believes Mercedes has built a nice, drivable car as he said: “Nobody expected porpoising in ‘22. So you can’t discount everything right now. But that's why I think we left Barcelona with a positive feeling because the car reacted as we anticipated.\n\n“The numbers we're seeing from the aero on the car match what we see back on the simulator, how the car is handling is matching how it feels on the simulator. So this is something we've not really experienced since 2021 as a team.\n\n“So we're sort of ticking the boxes of everything that we want to tick. But we can't discount our rivals because, as I said, there was a lot of talk around the Red Bull power unit not being up to standard year one - from what we've seen so far, they've definitely delivered.\n\n“Ferrari power unit looks reliable. They did lots of laps not far behind us over the course of a test and from a power unit side, Haas did loads of laps as well with the Ferrari engine. So the truth is that there could be a good fight on our hands, but we're satisfied with what we've experienced.”\n\nAlthough the 27-year-old is still somewhat playing down expectations ahead of the campaign, Russell does have the confidence of a driver who can finally take his maiden F1 crown.\n\nWhen the title favourite tag was put to the Briton, he said: “I didn't really feel anything from hearing that, to be honest.\n\n“As I've said for a long time, I feel ready to fight for a world championship and whether we have that comment above us or not, that does not change my approach one single bit.\n\n“I'm working so hard with the team. Everybody here has been working flat out to really maximise this new set of regulations and I'm honestly just so excited by the challenge because it is a huge challenge adapting to these new cars, how the energy management works, the re-harvesting of the batteries, getting your head around the boost system, the overtake modes, the active aero.\n\n“There's a lot of things we need to learn very quickly, but I feel I can take advantage from that and I feel confident with myself and my team.”\n\nThe challenges facing Mercedes ahead of F1 2026\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "title": "‘He Was A Steal For Us’: Maple Leafs Trading Of Prospect Fraser Minten To Boston Not Aging Well",
    "description": "As the Maple Leafs risk missing the postseason for the first time in a decade, the immediate success of Fraser Minten in Boston is turning the Brandon Carlo trade into the latest chapter in a long history of lopsided deals between the two rivals.",
    "fullText": "It’s been less than a year since the Toronto Maple Leafs shipped Fraser Minten, along with a top-five protected first-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft, to Boston for veteran defenseman Brandon Carlo. While the Leafs certainly needed a player like Carlo, a right-handed shutdown defenseman who could play alongside Morgan Rielly, few would have predicted that Toronto would find themselves on the short end of the deal so quickly.\n\nWith the Leafs appearing bound to miss the playoffs for the first time in ten years, Minten has excelled with his new team. He was named the NHL’s Rookie of the Month for January after scoring eight goals and adding six assists in 14 games. Recently, he was promoted to the club’s first line to play alongside Morgan Geekie and David Pastrnak before moving back to the second-line center position.\n\n“He was a steal for us,” Bruins head coach Marco Sturm said regarding the acquisition. Perhaps more impressive is that all eight of Minten’s goals came at even strength, as he was not slated to receive significant power-play time.\n\nFraser Minten of the @NHLBruins, who topped all rookies with 8-6—14 and a +12 rating in 14 games, has been named the NHL’s “Rookie of the Month” for January.#NHLStats: https://t.co/idkVX4OOtV pic.twitter.com/HbZNsruplR\n\n— NHL Public Relations (@NHLPR) February 1, 2026\n\n“I’m very, very happy with the way he’s been playing all year long,” Sturm added. “I put him in different situations from the fourth line to pretty much the first line, and you could see he can do it all. He definitely has something a lot of players don’t have”.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlo has missed 23 games this season due to an ankle injury that required a corrective procedure. While injuries have contributed to Toronto’s struggles, handing Boston a high first-round pick is a tough pill to swallow—unless, of course, that pick remains in the top five.\n\nMarco Sturm on Fraser Minten: \"[He] was a steal for us.\"\n\nEveryone say #ThankYouToronto 🤭 pic.twitter.com/VlnzsxRTsk\n\n— NESN (@NESN) January 30, 2026\n\nAs Minten thrives, the trade is shaping up to be another lopsided Toronto-Boston transaction. History offers a grim reminder: in 2006, the Leafs traded goaltending prospect Tuukka Rask for Andrew Raycroft. Rask became a franchise icon, winning a Vezina Trophy and serving as a backup for the 2011 Stanley Cup-winning team before making two more Final appearances as a starter. He retired as the winningest netminder in Bruins history. Raycroft, by contrast, spent only two seasons in Toronto with mediocre results, despite a 37-win debut season.\n\nThe #OverDrive crew look back on the Brandon Carlo/Fraser Minten trade.\n\nDo you think the Leafs lost that trade, in hindsight? 👀@OverDrive1050 pic.twitter.com/2PnkR7DNgn\n\n— TSN (@TSN_Sports) January 30, 2026\n\nSimilarly, in 2009, the Leafs acquired Phil Kessel from the Bruins. While Kessel led the Leafs in scoring for six seasons, the acquisition cost Toronto two first-round picks and a second-round pick. Those first-rounders became Tyler Seguin (2nd overall) and Dougie Hamilton (9th overall)—both high-end talents who have enjoyed long, successful careers.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe January transfer window allows clubs across Europe to add mid-season reinforcements and make alterations as a reaction to their current positioning and squad health.\n\nSome clubs may wish to add players due to injuries, poor performance, or a strong first half of the campaign, which has positioned them to achieve more than they expected.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, may wish to move on from disgruntled players or get some cash for those who are slated to leave in the summer for free.\n\nThe Sporting News brings you a roundup of when the transfer window opens and closes across the major European leagues, who have come together in recent years to align their calendars with one another for a more streamlined process.\n\nMORE:Updated list of Premier League top goal scorers for 2025/26 season\n\nThe 2026 January transfer window closes for Premier League clubs onp.m. GMT (2 p.m. ET).\n\nThis is because the traditional closing date, January 31, falls on a Saturday, and as such it will close on the following Monday.\n\nLike the open date, the closing date is also matched for all of the major European leagues, meaning England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France's top flights all have the same closing date.\n\nThe only slight quirk is the time of day the window closes on. Serie A, Ligue 1, and the Bundesliga have synced with the Premier League perfectly, also closing at 7 p.m. GMT / 8 p.m. CET. However, the transfer window in Spain closes at 11:59 p.m. CET.\n\nThe January transfer window is a month-long period during which clubs can make changes to their roster.\n\nTechnically, a \"transfer window\" is actually a registration period, during which teams can register new players and make general changes to their league-official squad.\n\nPlayers acquired outside a transfer window cannot be registered until the new window opens.\n\nAdditionally, starting January 1, players who are out of contract in the summer are allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with a new club, under certain circumstances (e.g. Premier League players can sign for a foreign team). They are still contracted to their current club through the end of the season, but they are able to sign agreements with a new team to take effect at the expiration of their current deal.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the intricacies of the handball rule in soccer",

    "title": "Toto Wolff slams F1 rivals amid 2026 engine row: ‘They want to find excuses’",
    "description": "An engine controversy, with Ferrari, Audi and Honda complaining to the FIA over a ‘loophole’ Mercedes and Red Bull have found, was sharply dismissed by the Mercedes F1 CEO on Monday",
    "fullText": "Toto Wolff has slammed Mercedes’ F1 rivals over the sport’s engine controversy ahead of the 2026 season, sharply telling them to “get their s*** together.”\n\nIn one of the sport’s biggest-ever rule changes, new engine and chassis regulations are being introduced this year, with Mercedes the frontrunners after last week’s first pre-season test in Barcelona. However, a divide between the five engine manufacturers has already emerged over the off-season.\n\nFerrari, Audi and Honda have complained to the FIA (F1’s governing body) about Mercedes and Red Bull finding an engine “loophole”. The matter in question concerns the compression ratio of the internal combustion engine, specifically the ratio between the cylinder’s maximum and minimum volume. The rules mandate a 16:1 ratio, measured at an “ambient temperature” while the car is stationary, but Mercedes and Red Bull are believed to be exploiting thermal expansion, which would lead the compression ratio to be closer to the old 18:1 regulation while running on track.\n\nSuch an advantage could help teams by up to 0.3 seconds per lap and, as such, the other three engine manufacturers have written to the FIA insisting a ratio higher than the 16:1 figure mandated would be against the rules. Further meetings with the FIA on the matter are expected in the coming weeks.\n\nYet Mercedes team principal Wolff, speaking after the team’s 2026 car launch on Monday, criticised the outrage amongst other teams: “I just don’t understand that some teams concentrate more on others and keep arguing a case that is very clear and transparent.\n\n“Communication with the FIA was very positive all along, not only on compression ratio but other things too. Specifically in that area, it’s very clear what the regulations say, what the standard procedures are.\n\n“So just get your s*** together. Doing secret meetings and letters, and inventing ways of testing which don’t exist… I can just say at least from us, we’re trying to minimise distractions and that’s looking more at us, not everybody else.”\n\nRed Bull engine boss Ben Hodgkinson, formerly of Mercedes, also insisted he could not comprehend why a row has broken out – a viewpoint Wolff also threw his weight behind, with just five weeks until the season-opening race in Australia on 8 March.\n\n“It’s pretty clear what the regulations say,” he added. “Maybe we’re all different, maybe you want to find excuses before you’ve even started.\n\n“Everybody needs to do it to the best of their ability, but that’s not how we do things, especially if you’ve been told a few times it’s fine. It’s legal and what the regulations say. If someone wants to entertain themselves by distraction, they’re free to do that.”\n\nGiven Mercedes’s impressive execution in the last engine regulation change in 2014, leading to eight consecutive constructors’ titles, the Silver Arrows are thought to be at the front of the pecking order ahead of two more pre-season tests in Bahrain later this month.\n\nGeorge Russell is the early title favourite for the drivers’ championship, ahead of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.c“It’s always nice if your driver is the favourite,” Wolff added.\n\n“He [George] deserves it because he’s one of the best. He’s been overall more than great for us, but it’s the best driver and best car that wins.\n\n“We haven’t yet proven that there is a package which is good enough. I’d hope the bookmakers are right, but I’ll believe it when we have seen performances that have confirmed that.”\n\nThe next pre-season test is in Bahrain on 11-13 February.",

Tied with Tennessee and Kentucky, here are the SEC teams with more than one Quad 1A win.\n\nOver the next four games against Alabama (road), Florida (home), Missouri (road), and Vanderbilt (road), Texas A&M will have three Quad 1A opportunities, and winning one, or two of these tough matchups would likely guarentee the Aggies an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament, especially given the fact that McMillan's squad is a perfect 12-0 in Quad 3 and Quad 3 games.\n\nAfter Florida blew out Alabama 100-77 on Sunday night, Texas A&M has a chance to take advantage of the Crimson Tide's short turnaround before playing on Wednesday, but needs to play with the same mentality, and shoot at least 45% from the field, and hit free throws to have a chance at pulling off the upset.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M basketball's three Quad 1A wins tied for most in the SEC",

The former Real Madrid striker is expected to leave the Jeddah-based SPL club over a disagreement regarding Al-Ittihad’s contractual renewal offer.\n\nIlenikhena joined AS Monaco 18 months ago from Royal Antwerp in a reported €17m transfer fee, which is nearly half of Al-Ittihad’s proposal despite Ilenikhena scoring only ten goals in 51 games with the Principality club.",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are coming off a dismal season that led to a massive overhaul of the organization. Gone is Brian Callahan, and most of his staff, and the Titans have a new head coach in Robert Saleh. But that doesn’t mean that Tennessee didn't have some highlights.\n\nOne of those that marked Callahan’s last victory as Titans’ head coach, and much like the majority of his tenure, it was a fluke. Incredibly, this victory over the Arizona Cardinals was so improbable that it landed on CBS Sports' top 25 stories of the 2025 season.\n\n22. Tennessee Titans at Arizona Cardinals, Week 5: Cardinals, Jonathan Gannon, Kyler Murray, Emari Demercado collapse\n\nThis one requires us to go back quite a bit, but the butterfly effect is startling. The Cardinals, up 21-3 at home against the then-winless Tennessee Titans, suffered one of the wildest and most inexcusable collapses in recent memory en route to a 22-21 defeat.\n\nAlthough the Cardinals basically handed the Titans the victory, Tennessee looked competitive in the fourth quarter and made the plays necessary for the win, with Cam Ward making some big-time throws to give them a chance.\n\nThe Titans would go on to fire Callahan a couple of weeks later, with the win being the highlight of his final weeks in Nashville. But for that week, the football gods looked down on the Titans and gave them a memorable moment in the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Titans improbable victory over Cardinals one of the top stories in 2025",

    "fullText": "Notre Dame football had a big hole to fill when defensive backs coach Mike Mickens decided to leave for the NFL, but head coach Marcus Freeman filled the role on Sunday afternoon.\n\nAaron Henry, the now former defensive coordinator for Illinois will join the Irish according Matt Zenitz of CBS Sports. Like he has done in the past, Freeman made a fantastic hire, one where Henry will coach defensive backs along with being the co-defensive coordinator with Chris Ash.\n\nLike social media always does, there were plenty of positive Notre Dame reactions to this hire. Find out below some of the best social media post about the news of the Irish hiring Henry.\n\nMan that is an enormous move from Notre Dame. Henry is a rising star and getting him to take a functional demotion is a sign of how much cache the Irish have right now. https://t.co/hDoDq5cAoS\n\n— Dylan Sinn (@DylanSinn) February 1, 2026\n\nThere aren’t many programs around the country where a defensive coordinator would take a “demotion” to join a team, but that’s what happened here. Notre Dame has plenty of clout in the coaching world right now.\n\nAccording to a source, Notre Dame is expected to Aaron Henry as its new defensive backs coach, replacing Mike Mickens. Henry was defensive coordinator at Illinois the past three seasons.\n\nHenry coached defensive backs for Chris Ash at Rutgers in 2016.\n\n— Pete Sampson (@PeteSampson_) February 1, 2026\n\nRelationships matter, and with the hiring of Henry, he’s be reunited with his former boss, Ash. The familiarity between the two will go a long way towards the transition of the defensive side of the ball.\n\nMissed this a bit earlier. Marcus Freeman with a statement hire. https://t.co/zwyBwxDGje\n\n— Greg Smith (@GregSmithRivals) February 1, 2026\n\nWhile the multiple defensive coaching changes could have doomed the Irish, it doesn’t look like that will be the case. Freeman has done it again, as Notre Dame shouldn’t miss a beat with Henry coaching the secondary.\n\nA big hire for Notre Dame.\n\nThere were multiple NFL teams that had interest in Henry this cycle, including the Jacksonville Jaguars (whom he interviewed with), before he ultimately decided to accept this job with the Fighting Irish.https://t.co/4GOwOvHqCZ https://t.co/ZoeA3WQ8JJ\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s hard to turn down the NFL, but that’s exactly what Henry did with this move. He’ll still be a wanted man in the coming seasons, but for right now, he’s with Notre Dame.\n\nMarcus Freeman is just flat out one of the best in college football at surrounding himself with an elite staff \n\nEvery time Notre Dame loses a stud coach from their staff, Freeman makes an A+ hire to replace them https://t.co/PPp2bLe7JZ\n\n— Always Talkin’ Ball Podcast (@AlwaysTalkBall) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s pretty clear how you win at the college level now, having an older roster and an elite coaching staff, which it very much looks like Notre Dame will have this coming season. The expectations won’t be changed with Henry’s impending hire, win the College Football Playoff.\n\nOh and Aaron Henry coached Kerby Joseph into an All-Big Ten player Illinois after one season as a full time safety.\n\nJoseph was All-Pro for the Detroit Lions after leading the league in INTs (9) in 2024. \n\nElite resume for Aaron Henry while at Illinois. https://t.co/OWzjWxqrX3\n\n— Notre Dame Recruiting (@NDrecruiting01) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s one thing to send a 5-star or high 4-stars to the NFL, its entirely another to take lower ranked recruits and turn them into NFL draft picks, which is exactly what Henry has done. Imagine what he’s going to do with top-level players, it’s’ going to be impressive.\n\nNotre Dame is expected to hire Illinois @AaronHenry7 as it's next DB Coach.\n\nHere he is Mic'd up so you can get a feel. \n\nPlaces he's coached:\nFIU, Arkansas, Rutgers, NC State, Vanderbilt, Baylor, Illinois. \n\nIn 2022 he created the #1 scoring defense at Illinois. Without elite… pic.twitter.com/c7egECSEjG\n\n— CathVSConf☘️ (@CathVSConf) February 1, 2026\n\nJust a few years ago, Henry coached the top scoring defense in the country. There is no doubt in my mind that he can get Notre Dame close to that level too.\n\nThis is a chess move. Ash is probably gone after next year and Marcus can just remove the co- tag https://t.co/ljViGNwhBQ\n\n— Brendan (@verypiratey) February 1, 2026\n\nWith what Ash did last fall, and what he’s expected to do this season, there could be multiple teams looking to poach him from South Bend after the year ends. It would be a smooth transition to make Henry the full-time defensive coordinator if Ash does move on.\n\nI’m sorry, did we just pull a Defensive Coordinator from the B1G to be our DBs coach? 👀 https://t.co/Pgp55I7l2r\n\n— The 4 Horsemen Podcast (@HorsemenPod) February 1, 2026\n\nHenry will be more than just a defensive backs coach, but it’s still very impressive that Notre Dame pulled off this feat. Call it the Freeman-effect, as coaches see that he’s a superstar in the making.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social reactions to Notre Dame expected to hire Aaron Henry as co-DC",

    "fullText": "Who is going to be the Washington Commanders' starting middle linebacker in 2026?\n\nRising third-year linebacker Jordan Magee, from Temple University, was interviewed very briefly recently by Ben Standig, and Standig played the interview this past week on his podcast.\n\nWSH LB Jordan Magee in space vs. Achane#RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/HD3cmf6Itw\n\n— Last of the Fullbacks (@TheLastFullback) November 19, 2025\n\nWhere Jordan Magee started only one game in 2024, he showed improvement and was more healthy, starting eight games in 2025. Where in 2024 Magee was in on nine tackles, this past season, he was in on 54 tackles, three of which were for a loss. \"I thought there was a lot of growth for me as a player,\" expressed Magee. \"As I got out on the field more, I got more comfortable.\"\n\nGoing from his first year to his second, can be a time where your knowledge has increased, one can be much more relaxed, not tight mentally in games. Consequently, not pressing to think, one finds they can react much more freely and quickly. \"I wanted to work on getting off of blocks better. Working on my tackling, my tracking ability. For me, I want to play lower, for better leverage. So I work on my knee bend, trying to stay low while moving.\"\n\nBobby Wagner has been a great teacher and teammate. Wagner is known to be quite the leader in the classroom, in the film room, and on the field. Wagner reached a milestone the final game of the 2025 season when he recorded his career tackle No. 2000. The Commanders have a major decision to make regarding Wagner. He was clearly still a great run defender in between the tackles, but has lost a step or two in going sideline to sideline and in pass coverage.\n\nBut for Magee, it is still all about respect for Wagner on and off the football field. \"I appreciate him for everything that he has helped me with. I will probably go to his graduation in May (MBA from Howard U). You always got to show love and gratitude to somebody who accomplished that type of thing.\"\n\nAs for this 2026 offseason, what are the plans for Magee? Well, he will certainly be lifting and working out. He wants to keep his job in the NFL, entering his third season with the Commanders. But he also has a special trip that he wants to make this offseason.\n\nMagee said he wanted to go to Tokyo last year, but an injury needed rehab, so he did the work instead. He said he and his girlfriend plan to go this offseason to see what life and the culture are like in a major city in Japan.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Can Jordan Magee replace Bobby Wagner?",

    "fullText": "The transfer window closes tonight at 7pm after over a month of business across the Premier League.\n\nHowever, fans hoping to see late activity in the market at their clubs can keep the faith beyond 7pm.\n\nClubs are still allowed to strike deals after that time, provided they meet a specific rule that grants them a two-hour extension to finalise signings.\n\nA deal sheet is effectively a way for clubs to tell the Premier League that a transfer has been agreed – but they just need a bit more time to finalise the official documents.\n\nPremier League clubs can only use a deal sheet after 5pm, and it must be submitted before 7pm.\n\nIf all the relevant details are filled in, the Premier League grant an extra two hours for the deal to be completed.\n\nYou can see an example of a deal sheet below.\n\nArsenal signed Raheem Sterling using a deal sheet in summer 2024 – and once all media duties had been carried out, the Gunners ended up announcing the signing around 2am.\n\nHowever, this is only applicable to domestic transfers, and clubs must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight if they want to complete an international signing from abroad.\n\nThe Premier League describe the FIFA Transfer Matching System as follows.\n\n“When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on FIFA’s Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated.\n\n“The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details.\n\n“Our FA will request clearance and, as long as everything matches, the foreign association will issue clearance to the FA, who then informs the club and League.”\n\nIn years gone by, those in the English Football League (EFL) – meaning Championship, League One and League Two clubs – have also been allowed to submit a deal sheet for late transfers.\n\nHowever, the EFL have now put a stop to it.\n\nAn official statement reads: “In the EFL, all documentation must be provided prior to the deadline closing for the registration of a player to go through.”\n\nThere is – however – the presence of a ‘quick application’ which gives EFL clubs an extra 15 minutes to finalise transfers.\n\nIt is said: “If a club is in a Full Application at 10:30pm, they will receive a warning that states the system will open a Quick Application at 10:45pm, where only certain fields need to be completed.\n\n“In those last 15 minutes of the Transfer Window, EFL systems allow clubs to submit the necessary registration form without completing the full application process. Where they do this, the clubs then have a further 15 minutes to complete the full application process. This avoids clubs missing the deadline in circumstances where they have agreed and signed all necessary documents with another club and the player before 11pm, but still need time to complete the full application.”",

While the Centennial State is not known for being a football powerhouse, there are diamonds in the rough each year.\n\nOne of those diamonds is class of 2028 quarterback Titus Huard, son of former University of Washington and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Brock Huard. The Buffs made an offer to Huard on Sunday, joining several schools that had recently offered the quarterback.\n\nThe younger Huard plays for former Colorado interim head coach Mike Sanford at Valor Christian High School in Littleton, Colorado, where his father is also the tight ends coach.\n\nHuard has yet to be ranked by any recruiting outlet, but his 14 offers as a sophomore make him an already hot commodity on the recruiting trail. He holds offers from Washington, Texas Tech, Oregon, Colorado State, Kansas State, Arkansas and others.\n\nAfter a great talk with @CoachHouli I’m extremely honored to recieve an offer from @CUBuffsFootball!! #skobuffs @Coach_Sanford2 @GoValorFootball @kngdmsp @BrandonHuffman @adamgorney @TommyVento16 @DeionSanders pic.twitter.com/Vn7mc7kiUu\n\n— Titus Huard (@Titushuard7) February 1, 2026\n\nAt 6-foot-5, 205 pounds, Huard is a prototypical size for a quarterback, but also a starting pitcher. Huard advertises himself on social media as a quarterback, pitcher and power forward. He clearly has the quarterback position down, but it will be interesting to watch how his final two years of high school unfold regarding his other sporting interests.\n\nHuard is coming off a sophomore season where he completed 127 of 184 passes for 1,946 yards and 16 touchdowns. His team reached the 5A state semifinals.\n\nA commitment from Huard would be significant for Sanders and CU, given the in-state and coaching connections, as well as the prestige of the schools currently involved.\n\nFollow Charlie Strella on X, Threads and Instagram.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Colorado football recruiting QB Titus Huard offer",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings turned the page Friday on the Kwesi Adofo-Mensah era, firing the general manager after four seasons and promoting Vice President of Football Operations Rob Brzezinski to the interim GM role. Since Adofo-Mensah’s termination, several theories have swirled about why he got the boot, but one, above all else, takes the case: he drafted terribly.\n\nDraft misses piled up, the roster aged fast, and Minnesota chose a reset at GM.\n\nOf course, the Wilfs’ (Vikings ownership) decision considered all moving parts, but the fact remains Adofo-Mensah would still be employed if he drafted at an average or better success rate.\n\nMinnesota begins life without Adofo-Mensah for the first time in four years.\n\nSome have already pointed to Adofo-Mensah’s paternity leave, which lasted two weeks, as the smoking gun or Adofo-Mensah’s inability to re-sign Sam Darnold or Daniel Jones in the 2025 offseason.\n\nBut when it gets down to brass tacks, Adofo-Mensah did not replenish the roster with enough talent through the draft. Each draft has seven picks per team, and through 28 eligible throws at the dartboard, Adofo-Mensah brought home Donovan Jackson, Dallas Turner, Will Reichard, Levi Drake Rodriguez, Jordan Addison, and Jalen Nailor. That’s about it.\n\nHis success rate in the draft landed at 20% if the tabulator is feeling generous. The draft is, of course, a crapshoot, but that means a general manager should not expect to hit 100% of the time. That doesn’t give him a license to strike out 80% of the time.\n\nThat’s what happened with Adofo-Mensah. Approximately four-fifths of his picks flamed out. It made Minnesota’s current roster old compared to other NFL teams. And that’s a problem for an organization that wishes to keep the Super Bowl window open at all times.\n\nCompared to Other NFL Franchises\n\nHere’s the horribly dooming stat —\n\nMost Games Started per Player by Team,\nPlayers Drafted by THAT Team,\nSince 2022:\n\nOnly the Dolphins did it more poorly, and that squad also fired its general manager a couple of months ago. The NFL draft is the only place in football to get players for free, and Minnesota whiffed more often than not under Adofo-Mensah.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy Alone Might Have Saved Adofo-Mensah\n\nTo be clear: the largest indictment, at least right now, is McCarthy not panning through two seasons. Had McCarthy thrived in 2025, as many expected, Adofo-Mensah would actually be championed right now. For Adofo-Mensah, his spotty draft resume could be reversed if he just hit on McCarthy.\n\nSo far, McCarthy has not produced, missing 70% of all Vikings games due to injury.\n\nIf McCarthy turns into a franchise quarterback with the Vikings or another team, Adofo-Mensah will have an “I told you so” argument. But that just doesn’t matter during the 2026 offseason because Minnesota must decide to keep him as the QB1 or acquire a different passer.\n\nAll signs point to the latter with Adofo-Mensah removed from his position.\n\nCBS Sports‘ Robby Kalland wrote last weekend, “A new regime in Minnesota could mean changes at quarterback sooner rather than later. We’ll find out exactly how much belief coach Kevin O’Connell has in McCarthy, as Adofo-Mensah was clearly a strong believer in the young quarterback. A new GM, however, won’t have the same ties to him.”\n\n“As such, one of the first major evaluations for whoever steps into the general manager role will be whether they view McCarthy as the franchise quarterback of the future. Given the Vikings’ cap situation, it wouldn’t be surprising if McCarthy gets another year to show what he can do. Minnesota likely won’t be in the market for a high-priced free agent, and this year’s draft class isn’t highly regarded beyond Fernando Mendoza, who is the favorite to go No. 1 to the Raiders.”\n\nThankfully, Vikings fans can dream big again. They don’t have to dread the draft, an event that was guaranteed to result in underwhelming results over the last four years.\n\nPound-for-pound, the current roster is one of the NFL’s oldest. The only way to fix that is competent drafting in the next few years. Drafting rookies who play and remain on the roster for four years or more will go a long way toward changing the dynamic of an old roster.\n\nMinnesota went all-in last year after completing its competitive rebuild plan, and with that strategy in full motion, the roster should be one of the league’s youngest — not oldest.\n\nAdofo-Mensah forced himself to use free agency as a replenishing mechanism for his sad draft tendencies. The next guy or group will use the draft foremost to find talent, with free agency as the cake topper. It’s the only sustainable way to contend for a Super Bowl.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants face a critical wide receiver need heading into the offseason, as highlighted in Pro Football Focus' analysis of teams' biggest priorities for free agency and the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nPFF believes the Giants should focus on adding a receiver at No. 5 overall. Specifically, Ohio State wideout Carnell Tate.\n\nBiggest Need: Wide receiver Target: WR Carnell Tate, Ohio State\n\nMalik Nabers flashed star potential as a rookie in 2024, ranking eighth out of 133 qualifying wide receivers in PFF overall grade (86.7). He appeared in just four games this season before suffering a torn ACL, so we didn’t get an opportunity to see how he would develop with quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nBeyond Nabers, the Giants' wide receiver unit looks thin, especially since slot specialist Wan'Dale Robinson is heading into free agency and may not be back with the team. Sometimes overshadowed by Jeremiah Smith at Ohio State, Tate is a polished prospect in his own right after finishing fifth in the FBS with an 89.0 PFF receiving grade. He also did not drop a single pass across 66 targets this season.\n\nNabers' injury-shortened 2025 campaign underscores the urgency for depth and a reliable complement.\n\nTate, a 6-foot-3 OSU standout, offers elite reliability -- boasting a near-perfect drop rate and strong efficiency even while sharing targets with top talents. His high PFF grades and production (875 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025 despite missing time) position him as a potential top-10 pick, frequently mocked to the Giants at No. 5.\n\nTargeting Tate makes strategic sense to bolster Jaxson Dart's options and build around Nabers long-term. While the draft class is deep, passing on a polished, high-upside receiver like Tate could prolong the Giants' offensive struggles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Should New York Giants target WR Carnell Tate?",

    "fullText": "Matchday 20 in the Bundesliga saw Bayern Munich drop more points, Borussia Dortmund close the gap, Mainz 05 stun Leipzig, a head coach dismissal, and much more. Here is everything you need to know from matchday 20 in the Bundesliga.\n\nFor the second week in a row, Bayern Munich failed to win a Bundesliga game. Vincent Kompany’s side were held to a hard-fought 2-2 draw against Hamburger SV in the Volksparstadion on Saturday evening.\n\nIt was a gutsy performance from HSV, who, if they stay up, will have their displays at home to thank. 16 of their 19 points in the league this season have all come from home, and perhaps this was the most satisfying of the lot.\n\nHamburg’s pressure was then rewarded when a Kimmich follow-up on Nicolai Remberg resulted in a penalty, which Fabio Vieria converted to make 1-0. However, just before half-time, Harry Kane would equalise for Bayern with a swivelling shot.\n\nJust after half-time, substitute Luis Diaz scored to make it 2-1, but the game would continue to follow a similar pattern to the first half, and instead of accepting their fate, HSV came back and made it 2-2 through a Luka Vuskovic header.\n\nAt times in the second half, it looked as if Hamburg were the team more likely to win this game, as they had the better chances. The best example of this was when HSV countered, and a Philippe shot was cleared off the line by Alphonso Davies.\n\nBayern continued to increase the pressure on Hamburg. As the game approached full time, there would be a late penalty claim for handball, but the referee was having none of it – much to the dismay of the Bayern coaching staff and players.\n\nThe draw now means Bayern have collected just a point from a possible six from the last two matchdays. For HSV, it’s a crucial point as they sit just a point outside the relegation zone.\n\nIn typical Borussia Dortmund fashion, they left it late to win and take advantage of Bayern Munich dropping more points.\n\nDortmund hosted rock-bottom FC Heidenheim on Sunday, with everyone thinking that the home side would cruise to victory and close the gap on the league leaders to just six points.\n\nHowever, in classic Dortmund fashion, when Julian Niehues put Heidenheim 1-2 ahead in the second half, you could feel the collective groans from around Germany.\n\nDortmund pushed forward in search of an equaliser but, in doing so, left themselves exposed at the back. They were extremely fortunate not to fall two goals behind when Marvin Pieringer met a Hennes Behrens cross at the far post, only to somehow head over the crossbar when it appeared easier to score.\n\nDortmund’s pressure eventually brought them a lifeline when Niklas Dorsch handled Yan Couto’s cross inside the box. Guirassy stepped up and struck his penalty at Ramaj, who got a strong hand to it but could not prevent the ball from finding the back of the net.\n\nKovač’s men sensed blood and immediately went on the attack again, with Maximilian Beier breaking down the wing before finding Guirassy through on goal. The striker made no mistake, slipping the ball underneath Ramaj at his near post to spark scenes of jubilation inside the Westfalenstadion.\n\nBVB were then awarded another penalty when Guirassy was fouled by Tim Siersleben as he prepared to pull the trigger. With the chance to complete his hat-trick and effectively seal the win, the Guinean instead sent his spot-kick a good 10 yards over the crossbar in a woeful attempt at a Panenka.\n\nIn the closing stages, Heidenheim went in search of what they believed would have been a deserved equaliser, and in truth, they should have found it. They squandered multiple, and frankly, easy chances, to grab a late draw. On another day, Heidenheim would have run out 3-5 winners, and you wouldn’t have complained.\n\nHowever, the footballing gods were shining down on BVB, who now go six points within Bayern at the summit.\n\nWhilst there were some impressive results down the bottom of the league, possibly the biggest upset of matchday 20 was Mainz 05’s 1-2 away win at RB Leipzig.\n\nDespite Ole Werner’s side taking an early lead, the 05ers were able to rally, and a late first-half penalty from Nadiem Amiri meant it was level at the break. On the other side of half-time, winter signing Silas scored his first goal for the club too to give Mainz the lead (both of these goals were scored in the 49th minute). The win for Urs Fischer’s side means that for the first time since Bundesliga matchday five, they were out of the bottom three, and have now only lost once since the Swiss replaced Bo Henriksen.\n\nElsewhere in the Bundesliga, Eintracht Frankfurt suffered another defeat, this time against Bayer Leverkusen, who ran out 1-3 winners. It now means that from the seven games Frankfurt have played in 2026, they’ve conceded three goals in six of them. With Albert Riera taking charge on Monday, the Spaniard will have a lot of work to do when it comes to making this team a competent defensive team.\n\nWerder Bremen drew 1-1 with Borussia Monchengladbach, meaning they’re now just outside the relegation spots and winless since November. With that, the club announced the sacking of head coach Horst Steffen. Bremen are looking at Bo Henrikson or Bo Svensson as Steffen’s replacement. Either way, there’s a good chance the next head coach of Bremen will be called Bo.\n\nThere were wins for TSG Hoffenheim (3-1 vs Union Berlin), VfB Stuttgart (1-0 vs SC Freiburg), FC Köln (1-0 vs VfL Wolfsburg), and FC Augsburg (2-1 vs St. Pauli).",

    "fullText": "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has compared Benjamin Sesko and Liverpool forward Hugo Ekitike, following the former’s last-gasp winner against Fulham on Sunday.\n\nUnited produced a dramatic late show vs. Fulham at Old Trafford, to hand Michael Carrick his third successive victory since being named interim head coach.\n\nThe Red Devils took the lead in the 19th minute through Casemiro, who rose highest to head home a brilliant delivery from Bruno Fernandes. Casemiro then turned provider shortly after the break, slipping in a sensational no-look pass into the path of Matheus Cunha, who smashed the ball into the back of the net from a tight angle.\n\nCarrick’s men appeared to be cruising until Harry Maguire conceded a penalty, which Raul Jimenez scored to halve the deficit.\n\nKevin scored a screamer in stoppage time to make it 2-2 and break the hearts of United supporters, but substitute Sesko had other ideas. The Slovenian met Fernandes’s low cross, opened his body, and in one swift pivot, smashed the ball past a stranded Bernd Leno to win it.\n\nThe goal marked Sesko’s fifth in the Premier League this season, following his arrival in the summer. After the final whistle, a delighted Carrick was full of praise for the 22-year-old.\n\nHowever, speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show, Rooney strongly suggested that United could have perhaps gone for Ekitike instead of Sesko.\n\nRooney launched a comparison of Viktor Gyokeres, Ekitike and Sesko, clearly explaining why he feels Ekitike is the better striker out of the three.\n\nHe said [as quoted by the Metro], “We saw what Gyokeres did at Sporting, I know it was obviously a different country but he was scoring more goals than anyone and was absolutely on fire.”\n\n“I’ve backed Gyokeres this season and people have given me a bit of stick but I still think he’s making a different to Arsenal, I really do. He’s occupying defenders and that’s helping the team. I know he’s not got the goals or assists you’d want from your centre forward but I still think he’s having an impact.”\n\nAsked whether he would take Gyokeres ahead of Ekitike, Rooney answered, “No. Ekitike and [Granit] Xhaka at Sunderland have probably been the two best signings in the Premier League. I really enjoy watching Ekitike play. His second goal [against Newcastle] in particular was brilliant, it reminds me of Romario. A little toe-poke goal but it’s instinctive.”\n\n“He is the type of player I like to watch. He’s not a number nine, he’s not a number 10. He drifts out wide, he gets on the ball, brings players into the game and he can score goals. So he’s got a bit of everything really.”\n\nThe former England international continued, “I really enjoy watching those type of players [like Ekitike]. He’s got that arrogance and confidence.”\n\n“If you look at Sesko for instance, he looks like he needs a bit of guidance and a bit of help when he’s on the pitch. I know he scored the winner today thankfully but he looks like he needs a bit of guidance whereas Hugo Ekitike it looks like you can just put him on the pitch.”\n\n“He’s got that swagger about him which I think you need to be at that top-level.”\n\nUnited are next in action on Saturday when they host Thomas Frank’s Tottenham Hotspur in the early kick-off.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

Hibs, you look, you know, at their performance [in the draw with Rangers].\n\n\"It'll be the best top six that we've had in this split era because so many teams have so much to play for and so many strong teams are in there.\"",

    "description": "2026 F1 cars may not provide easier overtaking than their predecessors, the Haas drivers fear",
    "fullText": "Both Esteban Ocon and Oliver Bearman are pessimistic about overtaking with Formula 1’s 2026 machinery following the Barcelona pre-season test.\n\nThe Haas drivers were on track for three days – as many as allowed – in F1’s ‘shakedown’ last week and completed nearly 400 laps according to unofficial data.\n\nThat was enough to get a taste of the new VF-26, which meets F1’s revamped chassis and engine regulations for the upcoming season, featuring stripped-down aerodynamics as downforce is reduced by 15-30% and drag is cut by up to 40%.\n\nYet, overtaking may prove even trickier than in the past, based on early impressions from the Catalan running – even with the new Overtake Mode replacing DRS, which is a power boost for drivers within one second of a rival.\n\n“I've been following a few cars,” Ocon said. “You seem to lose quite a lot of front load, a bit more maybe than before, but we need to see. And the Overtake [Mode], yes, I played with it.\n\n“I don't want to give too early conclusions on how it's going to be because obviously, you know, it needs to be adjusted, optimised, etc., for that to work in a perfect way. But so far, it looks to be difficult to pass. That's my first thought about it, but I hope it's going to get on the easier side.”\n\nSophomore team-mate Bearman concurred, pointing out ‘quite a big shift in car balance’ in dirty air right behind another car.\n\n“In terms of following and overtaking and everything, I didn't really get a massive feeling on that of course, it's not a priority,” the 20-year-old Briton commented. “I managed to do a few laps in and around other cars.\n\n“I must say that it was a bit more challenging to follow, just given my relatively few laps I did. It picked up quite a big shift in balance compared to clean air, which seemed a bit more so than the previous generation of cars. But again, it's very early days.\n\n“No, I didn't really get to use the overtake mode, but I was still able to try it just in clean air. We need to obviously see the difference in cooling and all of those things. So I was able to try it, but I wasn't able to use it to overtake someone, if that makes sense.”\n\nLewis Hamilton: ‘New F1 cars more fun to drive’ than previous eras\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

It looks like the Toffees are using their other loan slot on Chelsea winger Tyrique George, so that should be it for loans from the Premier League. They do have two international loan slots to use as well should they so choose.\n\nFulback has been an area of need for the Blues for years now, even though David Moyes thinks Adam Aznou is not ready for the English top flight yet, and Jake O’Brien is his preferred choice for all things right back related. Will the Blues make a move today for one or the other?\n\nThere has been interest from the continent for Beto, Nottingham Forest and Sean Dyche have been told Dwight McNeil is not for sale and reports of an Aznou loan in Europe also abound. Doubt more than one of those three moves happen today, especially with how sparse Moyes’ squad is.\n\nTransferred – Harry Tyrer (Cardiff City – League One)\n\nLoaned – Roman Dixon (Stockport County – League One), Will Tamen (Tranmere Rovers – League Two), George Morgan (AS Cannes – Championnat National 2), Martin Sherif (Port Vale – League Two), Eli Campbell (Port Vale – League Two)\n\nThe winter transfer window closes at 7pm BST (6pm EST, 3pm PST) on Monday, February 2nd for the Premier League, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Serie A & La Liga, with an additional two hour period for clubs who have already submitted deal sheets in time.\n\nSky Sports News will be covering it all starting at 6am BST (1am EST, 10pm PST), here’s info from their website on how to watch.

    "fullText": "According to a report from Mundo Deportivo, Ferland Mendy has no intention of leaving Real Madrid, despite growing congestion in his position and the club’s desire to move him on.\n\nIt must be noted that the French full-back remains under contract with Los Blancos until 2027 and, for now, he is determined to see out his deal in Madrid.\n\nThis position comes at a time when the club is actively reviewing their options at left-back and are expected to once again open the door for Mendy’s exit in the summer.\n\nWhether that door is used, however, depends entirely on the player.\n\nThe situation at left-back has become one of the most complex puzzles for Real Madrid’s sporting department.\n\nAs things stand, the squad includes Alvaro Carreras, Fran Garcia, and Mendy as natural options for the role.\n\nOn top of that, Eduardo Camavinga has once again shown, most recently against Rayo Vallecano, that he can comfortably operate on the left side of defence when needed.\n\nFerland Mendy does not want to leave Real Madrid. (Photo by Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images)\n\nReal Madrid already made a major investment in the position last summer with the signing of Carreras from Benfica, paying a substantial €50 million to secure his arrival.\n\nInternally, the plan has been clear for some time. According to the aforementioned outlet, both Garcia and Mendy were seen as potential departures to balance the squad and reduce overcrowding.\n\nGarcia even came close to leaving during the January transfer window, but Real Madrid ultimately blocked his exit.\n\nThat leaves Mendy as the central issue. Within the club, his departure would make the most sense in terms of squad planning. However, the player’s position is very clear in his position.\n\nDespite limited continuity, injuries in recent seasons, and increased competition, Mendy has no plans to seek a move elsewhere.\n\nUnderstandably, this creates a delicate situation, as forcing an exit is not straightforward, especially with a contract running until 2027.\n\nAt the same time, carrying multiple left-backs risks reducing minutes, disrupting squad harmony, and limiting opportunities.",

    "fullText": "Juventus have made an approach to explore the availability of Everton forward Beto as the Italian giants continue their search for attacking reinforcements before the January transfer window closes. The Serie A side are understood to be prioritising the addition of a centre-forward, with sources confirming that an enquiry has been lodged in recent days.\n\nAs first reported by talkSPORT, the Premier League club are reluctant to sanction a late departure, particularly without securing a replacement. With limited time remaining in the market, Everton’s stance reflects both squad depth concerns and their wider strategy for the remainder of the season.\n\nThe developing situation places Beto at the centre of renewed transfer speculation, while Juventus weigh up their next steps in a highly competitive market.\n\nJuventus’ recruitment focus has sharpened significantly as the window enters its final stages. Senior club figures have identified the need for additional firepower, particularly in light of inconsistent goal output and the physical demands of domestic and European competition.\n\nBeto has emerged as a realistic option following internal assessments and market analysis. The Portuguese-born Guinea-Bissau international offers physical presence, aerial strength and experience in both Serie A and the Premier League, having previously featured for Udinese before joining Everton.\n\nJuventus had previously explored alternative targets, including high-profile forwards from within the Premier League, but valuation concerns and limited availability forced a reassessment. Attention has now turned towards players viewed as attainable within financial and regulatory frameworks.\n\nWhile discussions remain at an exploratory stage, the enquiry highlights Juventus’ intent to move decisively if favourable conditions arise.\n\nEverton’s reluctance to engage in formal negotiations reflects broader concerns surrounding squad balance and depth. Beto remains one of only two senior central strikers currently available to the club, making any mid-season exit a significant sporting risk.\n\nSince arriving from Udinese for a substantial fee, the striker has experienced mixed fortunes on Merseyside. He has contributed goals across competitions but has also faced periods of inconsistency and limited service.\n\nDespite this, club officials continue to value his work rate, physical contribution and professionalism. Internally, there is recognition that losing a recognised forward at this stage of the campaign could undermine stability in key fixtures.\n\nUnless Everton can identify and secure a suitable replacement in quick succession, their position is unlikely to soften.\n\nUnder David Moyes, Beto has remained an important squad figure despite fluctuating form. His recent performances, including a dramatic late equaliser away from home, have reinforced his value to the coaching staff.\n\nThe Everton manager has repeatedly highlighted the striker’s commitment and willingness to improve. Public comments following recent matches suggest belief that confidence and continuity could unlock further progress.\n\nStatistically, Beto’s output this season reflects steady, if unspectacular, returns. Three league goals and additional contributions in cup competitions underline his ability to influence games, particularly in high-pressure moments.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, his profile suits teams seeking a direct focal point, capable of occupying defenders and creating space for attacking runners. This makes him an appealing option for Juventus as they assess compatibility with their existing squad.\n\nWith the transfer window approaching its conclusion, Juventus face a strategic decision. They must weigh Everton’s firm stance against the urgency of strengthening their attack.\n\nPotential solutions include structured loan proposals, options to buy, or late compromise on valuation. However, Everton’s negotiating position remains strong, particularly given the limited time available to reinvest.\n\nFor Beto, the situation represents both opportunity and uncertainty. A return to Serie A could offer familiarity and renewed momentum, yet stability and regular minutes at Everton remain valuable for his development.\n\nUnless negotiations accelerate significantly, a move before deadline day appears challenging. Juventus may yet explore alternative targets, while Everton continue preparations with the expectation that their striker will remain.\n\nNevertheless, as recent windows have demonstrated, late-market dynamics can shift rapidly, and both clubs remain alert to developments.",

    "description": "Alex Marquez insists Gresini is the \"most solid option\" for him, but does not rule out leaving Ducati's satellite team to chase a factory seat",
    "fullText": "Alex Marquez, who is finalising his signing with KTM’s factory team for 2027, believes that more than half of the MotoGP grid will have their contracts settled before the first race of the season.\n\nThe younger Marquez's market value has increased exponentially since he finished runner-up in the 2025 standings. At 29 years of age, and after six seasons in MotoGP, the time has probably come for him to capitalise on it.\n\nIn this regard, Motorsport.com understands that the Gresini rider has virtually sealed his future from 2027 onwards with KTM. Pending the final signature, which should be formalised over the coming days, Marquez will share the garage with Maverick Vinales, who will step up from the Tech3 team.\n\n“The objective of every rider is to race for a factory team. But I’m very happy at Gresini. When the moment comes I will decide what is best for my future, but for now I want to focus on this pre-season,” Marquez said at the Sepang circuit, where the first three days of collective testing for 2026 get underway on Tuesday.\n\nIn his best season in the premier class, the Spaniard amassed three victories and a total of 12 podiums, allowing him to finish just behind his brother Marc Marquez, who was nearly untouchable until he was injured in Indonesia.\n\nIn addition to the runner-up spot, that achievement enabled Alex Marquez to improve his status within Ducati, to the point of securing the latest Desmosedici for the upcoming campaign.\n\nAfter a few frenetic days regarding the rider market, Marquez gave away little information, so that no one could interpret from his words that he has already decided which leathers he will be wearing.\n\n“We are working to have the best options when the moment to decide arrives. I won’t hide that Gresini is the most solid option, but it’s true that maybe this is a moment to take a risk, because you don’t know which bike will be the most competitive under the new regulations,” he said.\n\nMarquez has previously been a factory rider in MotoGP, riding for Repsol Honda in 2020 when he made his debut in the premier class.\n\nMarquez is convinced that most pieces of the puzzle could fall into place before the lights go out in Buriram on the first weekend of March.\n\n“More than 50% of the grid will have their future settled before the first race. Many teams, many manufacturers need to sign riders early so they don’t slip away,” he said.\n\nAlex Marquez targeting factory MotoGP seat at Yamaha and KTM\n\nThis is how every bike on the 2026 MotoGP grid looks\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. did not make the 2026 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday and social media reacted to his unexpected snub.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. was thought at one point in time to be one of the players that was going to make the All-Star Game for the first time in his career given the season that he's had to this point. In anticipation of Porter being Brooklyn's first All-Star since the 2021-22 season (Kevin Durant), there were plenty of questions asked of the organization regarding the honor, until it was revealed that Porter would not be named an All-Star after all.\n\nOn Sunday, around the same time that the Nets tipped off for what ended up being their 130-77 loss at the Detroit Pistons, it was reported by various insiders that Porter did not make the 2026 Eastern Conference All-Star team as a reserve. While there seemed to be virtual locks to make the team as a reserve, such as Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell and Atlanta Hawks forward Jalen Johnson, Porter was considered by many to be among that group due to his impact on Brooklyn this season.\n\nThe reserves for the East are Mitchell, Johnson, New York Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns, Indiana Pacers forward Pascal Siakam, Miami Heat guard Norman Powell, Toronto Raptors forward Scottie Barnes, and Detroit Pistons center Jalen Duren. Those seven players will join the five starters in Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey, Knicks guard Jalen Brunson, Pistons guard Cade Cunningham, Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, and Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nWow, I really thought Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. was going to the All-Star Game. My guess is that the voting came down to Porter and Pacers forward Pascal Siakam. https://t.co/09uVZSckSk\n\n— Sharif Phillips-Keaton (@SharifKeaton) February 1, 2026\n\nPorter, 27, is having the best season of his career as he is averaging 25.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game while shooting 48.2% from the field and 39.8% from three-point land in 38 appearances. While Brooklyn (13-34) has one of the worst records in the Eastern Conference, part of Porter's case was the fact that the Nets are just 1-9 without him in the lineup, demonstrating his importance to the team.\n\nWhile Porter didn't make the All-Star team despite the push by many to see him be among the players making an All-Star appearance for the first time in their career, that doesn't take away from the fact that he's having a terrific season and he's far from the only snub. Here's how social media reacted to Porter being snubbed from the 2026 NBA All-Star Game:\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is an incredible snub from the All-Star Game.\n\nThe Eastern Conference coaches should be ashamed that they voted based on reputation and/or team record.

    "description": "The Mercedes driver, in a year of new regulations, is the early favourite for the world championship",
    "fullText": "George Russell insists he is desperate to go “head-to-head” with arch rival Max Verstappen ahead of the 2026 F1 season.\n\nMercedes driver Russell is the pre-season favourite for the world championship this year, with the Silver Arrows thought to be the early frontrunners amid a massive regulation shake-up this year.\n\nRed Bull’s Verstappen, meanwhile, fell just two points short of a fifth consecutive title last year as McLaren’s Lando Norris won his first championship. Yet Russell, who had a massive feud with Verstappen at the end of the 2024 season, is adamant he is ready to fight for a world championship, while playing down Mercedes’ tag as favourites.\n\n“I want to go head-to-head with Max,” Russell said, speaking at Mercedes’ 2026 car launch on Monday. “I think the fans are probably expecting for this year to be Mercedes vs McLaren, there’s a lot of anticipation.\n\n“But it seems that the other power units have done a good job, Red Bull have always had an amazing car and we know how good Max is.\n\n“I think he’s very much going to be in the fight this year. You obviously wish you have an easier time, but it should never be easy. If you’re going to win, you want to have fought for it on track.\n\n“I’ve been surprised by our rivals. Red Bull on the power unit side has been very impressive, kudos to them. We’ve had a very reliable test [last week], but we’ll have to wait and see if the car lives up to expectations.”\n\nBritish racer Russell, heading into his fifth season with Mercedes, insisted he doesn’t feel any extra pressure given the early ‘favourite’ tag, but did lavish praise on Aston Martin after last week’s pre-season test in Barcelona.\n\nRussell added: “We’ve only driven the car for three days [in Barcelona last week], quoting Toto, it doesn’t look like a turd!\n\n“Is it a car that can produce a world championship? It’s still too early to see. [Favourite tag] doesn’t make me feel anything. I feel ready to fight for a world championship, but we want to reel in expectations.\n\n“The best case scenario is a number of different drivers and teams all battling it out. Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari - four teams are all quite close, but you can’t discount what you’ve seen from Aston Martin, what Adrian [Newey] has done looks quite spectacular.\n\n“Honda have had a very good engine with Red Bull, we know what they’re capable of. It would be awesome to see a big fight.”\n\nRussell will be leading the team alongside teenager Kimi Antonelli for the second consecutive year, after Lewis Hamilton left the team in 2024.\n\nThe next pre-season test is in Bahrain on 11-13 February, with the new season starting with the Australian Grand Prix on 8 March.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool feel they've ultimately landed a player better than Marc Guehi. The Reds nearly signed the defender in the summer.\n\nMarc Guehi was incredibly close to becoming a Liverpool player this season. A deal was in place right at the end of the summer transfer window, with just about everyone convinced it would happen.\n\nEveryone except Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish, anyway. Knowing full well that his captain could leave after the season at the end of his contract.\n\nParish cancelled the deal right at the last minute when it became clear that Palace couldn't find a replacement and that's fair enough. But it left Liverpool needing a backup plan and the most obvious one was to try again for Guehi in January.\n\nHe'd be even cheaper by that stage, though not in wages. Though, it always meant that Liverpool would be paying for just five months of football rather than a full season.\n\nThey didn't want to do that in the end while Manchester City were happy to pay up. Fortunately, Liverpool feel they've landed on their feet.\n\nLiverpool are about to complete a deal for Jeremy Jacquet by all accounts. The Athletic claim it'll cost them around £55m up front, with a further £5m in add-ons.\n\nThe Reds have pushed hard to get the centre-back, who will remain with Rennes until the end of the season. But he'll join Liverpool in the summer - we'll just all have to wait.\n\nAnd there's real excitement around the 20-year-old. Jacquet is inexperienced but his reputation in France is phenomenal. Everyone appears to believe he's destined for the very, very top of the game - which is exactly what you need when replacing Virgil van Dijk is the dream here.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Haplodiploidy is a sex-determination system in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, and females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid.[1] Haplodiploidy is sometimes called arrhenotoky.\n\nHaplodiploidy determines the sex in all members of the insect orders Hymenoptera (bees, ants, and wasps)[2] and Thysanoptera ('thrips').[3] The system also occurs sporadically in some spider mites, Hemiptera, Coleoptera (bark beetles), and rotifers.\n\nIn this system, sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female, and an unfertilized egg develops as a male. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and are haploid.\n\nThe haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. For example, a male has no father and cannot have sons, but he has a grandfather and can have grandsons. Additionally, if a eusocial-insect colony has only one queen, and she has only mated once, then the relatedness between workers (diploid females) in a hive or nest will be on average 3⁄4. This means the workers in such monogamous single-queen colonies are significantly more closely related than in other sex determination systems where the relatedness of siblings is usually no more than 1⁄2. It is this point which drives the kin selection theory of how eusociality evolved.[4] Whether haplodiploidy did in fact pave the way for the evolution of eusociality is still a matter of debate.[5][6]\n\nAnother feature of the haplodiploidy system is that recessive lethal and deleterious alleles will be removed from the population rapidly because they will automatically be expressed in the males (dominant lethal and deleterious alleles are removed from the population every time they arise, as they kill any individual they arise in).[3]\n\nHaplodiploidy is not the same thing as an X0 sex-determination system. In haplodiploidy, males receive one half of the chromosomes that females receive, including autosomes. In an X0 sex-determination system, males and females receive an equal number of autosomes, but when it comes to sex chromosomes, females will receive two X chromosomes while males will receive only a single X chromosome.\n\nSeveral models have been proposed for the genetic mechanisms of haplodiploid sex-determination. The model most commonly referred to is the complementary allele model. According to this model, if an individual is heterozygous for a certain locus, it develops into a female, whereas hemizygous and homozygous individuals develop into males. In other words, diploid offspring develop from fertilized eggs, and are normally female, while haploid offspring develop into males from unfertilized eggs.\nDiploid males would be infertile, as their cells would not undergo meiosis to form sperm. Therefore, the sperm would be diploid, which means that their offspring would be triploid. Since hymenopteran mother and sons share the same genes, they may be especially sensitive to inbreeding: Inbreeding reduces the number of different sex alleles present in a population, hence increasing the occurrence of diploid males.\n\nAfter mating, each fertile hymenopteran female stores sperm in an internal sac called the spermatheca. The mated female controls the release of stored sperm from within the organ: If she releases sperm as an egg passes down her oviduct, the egg is fertilized.[7]\nSocial bees, wasps, and ants can modify sex ratios within colonies which maximizes relatedness among members and generates a workforce appropriate to surrounding conditions.[8] In other solitary hymenopterans, the females lay unfertilized male eggs on poorer food sources while laying the fertilized female eggs on better food sources, possibly because the fitness of females will be more adversely affected by shortages in their early life.[9][10] Sex ratio manipulation is also practiced by haplodiploid ambrosia beetles, who lay more male eggs when the chances for males to disperse and mate with females in different sites are greater.[11]\n\nIn honeybees, the drones (males) are entirely derived from the queen, their mother. The diploid queen has 32 chromosomes and the haploid drones have 16 chromosomes. Drones produce sperm cells that contain their entire genome, so the sperm are all genetically identical except for mutations. The male bees' genetic makeup is therefore entirely derived from the mother, while the genetic makeup of the female worker bees is half derived from the mother, and half from the father.[12] Thus, if a queen bee mates with only one drone, any two of her daughters will share, on average, 3⁄4 of their genes. The diploid queen's genome is recombined for her daughters, but the haploid father's genome is inherited by his daughters \"as is\". It is also possible for a laying worker bee to lay an unfertilised egg, which is always a male.\n\nThere are rare instances of diploid drone larvae. This phenomenon usually arises when there is more than two generations of brother-sister mating.[13] Sex determination in honey bees is initially due to a single locus, called the complementary sex determiner (csd) gene. In developing bees, if the conditions are that the individual is heterozygous for the csd gene, they will develop into females. If the conditions are so that the individual is hemizygous or homozygous for the csd gene, they will develop into males. The instances where the individual is homozygous at this gene are the instances of diploid males.[14] Diploid males do not survive to adulthood, as the nurse worker bees will cannibalize the diploid males upon hatching.[15]\n\nWhile workers can lay unfertilized eggs that become their sons, haplodiploid sex-determination system increases the individual's fitness due to indirect selection. Since the worker is more related to the queen's daughters (her sisters) than to her own offspring, helping the queen's offspring to survive helps the spread of the same genes that the worker possesses more efficiently than direct reproduction.[16]\n\nBatches of worker bees are short lived and are constantly being replaced by the next batch, so this kin selection is possibly a strategy to ensure the proper working of the hive. However, since queens usually mate with a dozen drones or more, not all workers are full sisters. Due to the separate storage of drone sperm, a specific batch of brood may be more closely related than a specific batch of brood laid at a later date. However, many other species of bees, including bumblebees, such as Bombus terrestris, are monandrous.[17] This means that sisters are almost always more related to one another than they would be to their own offspring, thus eliminating the conflict of variable relatedness present in honeybees.[18]\n\nIn wasps of the genus Nasonia, a non-CSD method of sex determination has been documented. The most recent accepted model for this non-CSD system is called Maternal Effect Genomic Imprinting Sex Determination (MEGISD). This model involves a masculinizing/virilizing maternal effect gene that “imprints upon” the cytoplasmic component of oocytes, and an “unimprinted” paternal contribution (in female offspring) that provides a counter effect to virilization and allows for female development to occur. Since all diploid eggs become female (due to the factor originating in the male genetic contribution that prevents masculinization), this differs from CSD in that under CSD, diploid eggs can become males if they are homozygous or hemizygous.[19]\n\nRelatedness is used to calculate the strength of kin selection (via Hamilton's rule).[20] The haplodiploidy hypothesis proposes that the unusual 3⁄4 relatedness coefficient amongst full haplodiploid sisters is responsible for the frequency of evolution of eusocial behavior in hymenopterans.[21] A eusocial worker helping her mother birth more sisters propagates more of her own genes than had she reproduced herself.\n\nIn normal sexual reproduction, the father has two sets of chromosomes, and crossing over takes place between the chromatids of each pair during the meiosis which produces the sperm. Therefore, the sperms are not identical, because in each chromosome of a pair there will be different alleles at many of the loci. But when the father is haploid all the sperms are identical (except for a small number where gene mutations have taken place in the germ line). So, all female offspring inherit the male's chromosomes 100% intact. As long as a female has mated with only one male, all her daughters share a complete set of chromosomes from that male. In Hymenoptera, the males generally produce enough sperm to last the female for her whole lifetime after a single mating event with that male.[20]\n\nRelatedness coefficients in haplodiploid organisms are as follows, assuming that a female has only mated once. These ratios apply, for example, throughout a bee hive, unless some laying workers produce offspring, which will all be males from unfertilised eggs: in that case, average relatedness will be lower than shown.\n\nUnder this assumption that mothers only mate once, sisters are more strongly related to each other than to their own daughters. This fact has been used to explain the evolution of eusociality in many hymenopterans. However, colonies which have workers from multiple queens or queens which have mated multiple times will have worker-to-worker relatedness which is less than worker-to-daughter relatedness, such as in Melipona scutellaris.",

    "description": "Infections had turned his lungs to soup and had to be cleared before transplant.",
    "fullText": "Humans can’t live without lungs. And yet for 48 hours, in a surgical suite at Northwestern University, a 33-year-old man lived with an empty cavity in his chest where his lungs used to be. He was kept alive by a custom-engineered artificial device that represented a desperate last-ditch effort by his doctors. The custom hardware solved a physiological puzzle that has made bilateral pneumonectomy, the removal of both lungs, extremely risky before now.\n\nThe artificial lung system was built by the team of Ankit Bharat, a surgeon and researcher at Northwestern. It successfully kept a critically ill patient alive long enough to enable a double lung transplant, temporarily replacing his entire pulmonary system with a synthetic surrogate. The system creates a blueprint for saving people previously considered beyond hope by transplant teams.\n\nThe patient, a once-healthy 33-year-old, arrived at the hospital with Influenza B complicated by a secondary, severe infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that in this case proved resistant even to carbapenems—our antibiotics of last resort. This combination of infections triggered acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition where the lungs become so inflamed and fluid-filled that oxygen can no longer reach the blood.\n\nIn this case, the infections were necrotizing—the cells in the lungs were dying, turning his lung tissue into a liquid. The surgeons faced a seemingly impossible choice. The patient needed a transplant to survive, but he was in refractory septic shock. His kidneys were shutting down, and his heart was failing to the point where it completely stopped shortly after hospital admission. The doctors had to bring him back with CPR.\n\nHe was too sick for a transplant, yet the very organs that needed replacing were the source of the infection fueling his decline. “When the infection is so severe that the lungs are melting, they’re irrecoverably damaged,” Bharat explained. “That’s when patients die.”\n\nTo save him, Bharat’s team had to remove the infected lungs, a procedure called a bilateral pneumonectomy, to remove the source of the sepsis. We have machines that can oxygenate the blood. But removing both lungs creates a lethal mechanical problem for the heart.\n\nThe human heart is two pumps in one. The right side, called the pulmonary circuit, pumps oxygen-poor blood returning from the body into the lungs, which remove its carbon dioxide and load it with a fresh supply of oxygen. The left side, known as the systemic circuit, receives freshly oxygenated blood and pumps it to the rest of the body. The pulmonary vascular bed, all these miles of tiny vessels inside the lungs, facilitates this gas exchange. But it also acts as a capacitor, absorbing the pressure and volume of the blood ejected by the right ventricle.\n\nIf you remove the lungs and simply shut the pulmonary arteries, the right ventricle has nowhere to pump—it would experience an immediate, massive pressure spike, distend like a balloon, and fail within minutes. At the same time, the left side of the heart would have no blood returning to it, leading to a total collapse of blood pressure and systemic circulation.\n\nThis is the reason why most double-lung transplants are performed sequentially: The surgeons replace one lung, get it up and running, and then move on to the second. But desperate times require desperate measures.\n\nIn rare cases where both lungs must be removed at once, a patient can still be supported by the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), a mechanical lung that takes blood out of the body, removes the carbon dioxide, adds oxygen, and pumps it back in. The problem is that while ECMO can support a person for up to over a year when their lungs are still in their body, the risks of using it skyrocket when the lungs are removed.\n\nThe empty chest cavity creates a void where blood and fluids can pool, leading to huge internal bleeding. The heart, which relies on the physical presence and pressure of the lungs to maintain its proper anatomical position, can flop around or collapse. Finally, circulating blood through complex machinery significantly increases the risk of stroke or clotting.\n\nBecause of all these risks, surgeons always treat removing both lungs as the last line of defense, one they can only rely on for a short time—the shorter the better. Bharat and his colleagues, though, had to keep their patient this way until the sepsis had been dealt with.\n\nIt wasn’t enough for the team to keep the patient alive without lungs in his body until the transplant arrived. In this lungless state, somehow, they had to improve his health.\n\nTo make this happen, Bharat’s team engineered a device they called the “flow-adaptive extracorporeal total artificial lung system” (TAL), a complex circuit designed to mimic the physics of the missing organs. At its core was a pump and an oxygenator borrowed from the standard ECMO setup, but it also used four new components to replace biological functions.\n\nThe first was a dual-lumen cannula, essentially a single tube with two separate channels inside. Inserted through the internal jugular vein, this tube acted as the primary drain. It allowed the team to pull deoxygenated blood directly from the right side of the heart, unloading the right ventricle to prevent it from distending.\n\nThe second component was something the researchers called a flow-adaptive shunt, which connected the right pulmonary artery back to the right atrium. When the right ventricle pumped out more blood than the external pump could handle, the excess blood would safely recirculate back into the atrium through this low-resistance path, protecting the heart and the surgical staples from pressure spikes. During the 48 hours the patient was supported by the TAL, this shunt self-regulated its flow to anywhere between 1.1 and 6.3 liters per minute, based on the patient’s needs.\n\nTo ensure the left side of the heart stayed full and active, the team used a device called dual left atrial return. It comprised two 10 mm grafts that returned oxygenated blood from the ECMO artificial lung directly into the left atrium. This, the team said in a paper that describes the hardware, maintained what’s called Starling physiology: the principle that the heart pumps better when it is properly filled. It also prevented blood from stagnating and forming clots inside the heart chambers.\n\nFinally, to prevent the heart from physically shifting and damaging vital vessels in the empty chest cavity, the surgeons used bovine pericardium to reconstruct the heart’s protective sac and filled the empty space with tissue expanders and surgical sponges.\n\nThe results of hooking the patient up to TAL were immediate.\n\nWithin hours of the surgery, the patient’s septic shock began to resolve. His lactate levels, a key marker of tissue oxygen starvation, dropped from a dangerous 8.2 mmol/L to a normal level of less than 1.0 mmol/L within 24 hours. The medications used to keep his blood pressure up were discontinued after just 12 hours.\n\nFor two days, the patient lived as a human being with no lungs, stabilized by a machine that breathed and buffered his circulation with surgical precision. When donor lungs became available 48 hours later, the patient’s body was no longer suffering from sepsis.\n\nHe was ready for the transplant, which the team successfully performed. And after putting in the new lungs, they focused on the lungs they had removed.\n\nConventionally, patients with ARDS do not get transplants because doctors hope that with the right treatment and support, the diseased lungs will eventually heal. But the examination of the infected lungs removed from Bharat’s patient told a different story and helped define the clinical point of no return, when a lung is truly dead.\n\nBased on the spatial transcriptomics, a set of techniques that let scientists see which genes are active at different sites in the tissue, the team built a high-resolution molecular map of the removed lungs. What they found was a landscape of total devastation.\n\nThe lungs were filled with aberrant basaloid cells—a signature of failed regeneration. The stem cells required to rebuild the lungs were almost entirely gone. The architecture was uniformly destroyed and replaced by cells that were laying down scar tissue.\n\n“People think if you get severe ARDS, you keep supporting them and ultimately the lungs will get better,” Bharat says.  The data collected by his team suggested no amount of waiting or life support would have brought this patient’s lungs back to life. “In my practice, young patients die almost every week because no one realized that transplantation was an option,” Bharat added.\n\nIn many hospitals, patients with severe, acute lung infections are often allowed to die because they are considered too unstable for surgery. While Bharat’s study offers some hope that this situation might improve in the future, the team admits that their approach currently requires immense expertise and access to a highly specialized medical center with donor lungs. Making expertise and resources more accessible will take some time.\n\nAnd that’s not the only thing we have to wait for. Bharat and his colleagues note in their paper that one key challenge in ARDS is determining whether the injury is reversible. His study offers some initial insights into diagnosing irreversible damage, but the researchers note that their conclusions were based on a single case. The features of lungs that are beyond repair may differ across various pathogens, stages of disease, or the way individual patient’s body responds to the disease.\n\nFor Bharat’s patient, though, all possible stars aligned. The paper says that two years after the procedure, he has returned to a normal, independent life with excellent lung function.\n\nMed, 2026. DOI: 10.1016/j.medj.2025.100985",

    "title": "Context-Generic Programming v0.6.1 Release: Improving Ergonomics and Debugging",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "This blog post is co-authored by Claude Haiku based on a human draft. All content has been reviewed by the human author.\n\nWe're excited to announce the release of cgp v0.6.1, which brings several quality-of-life improvements to Context-Generic Programming in Rust. This release focuses on making CGP more accessible to developers new to the paradigm while also providing better debugging and verification tools for complex provider setups.\n\nThe changes in this release reflect our commitment to lowering the barrier to entry for CGP, while maintaining the power and flexibility that make it such a compelling approach to modular Rust code. Whether you're an experienced CGP user or just getting started, we believe you'll find these improvements meaningful.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles when learning CGP is understanding how generic Context parameters work in provider implementations. While generics are fundamental to Rust, they can be intimidating to developers coming from object-oriented backgrounds, or even to experienced Rust developers who haven't deeply explored the generic type system.\n\nWhen writing a #[cgp_impl] provider, you previously had to explicitly declare the Context as a generic parameter and ensure it appeared correctly throughout your implementation. This added cognitive overhead that wasn't directly related to the business logic you were implementing. For beginners, this meant wrestling with generic syntax before they could even focus on understanding the core CGP concepts like delegation and trait constraints.\n\nCGP v0.6.1 introduces support for implicit Context types in the #[cgp_impl] macro. You can now omit the explicit generic parameter and use familiar Rust patterns like Self to refer to the context type.\n\nLet's look at a concrete example. Suppose we're building a greeting system where different types can greet people:\n\nBefore v0.6.1, the provider implementation would look like:\n\nWith v0.6.1, you can simplify this to:\n\nThe difference might seem small at first glance, but it has a profound impact on readability and accessibility. The new syntax eliminates the generic parameter syntax entirely, making the provider implementation look much more like a standard Rust trait implementation. For someone new to CGP coming from an OOP background, this is far less intimidating—it reads like implementing a method on a class, which is a familiar pattern.\n\nThis improvement particularly shines when you have multiple providers in a codebase. Each provider definition becomes clearer and more focused on the actual logic, rather than the generic plumbing.\n\nAs your CGP applications grow in complexity, so does the challenge of verifying that all your provider wiring is correct. This is particularly true when using higher-order providers—providers that accept other providers as generic parameters.\n\nWhen you compose multiple providers together and something goes wrong, the compiler error messages can be cryptic. The error might point to a deep dependency in the chain, but it won't clearly tell you which individual provider in the composition is actually failing. This forces developers to compile and test repeatedly, changing providers and wiring patterns to narrow down the issue.\n\nCGP v0.6.1 introduces the #[check_providers] attribute for the check_components! macro, which lets you verify that specific providers work correctly with a given context. This is a powerful debugging tool that allows you to isolate and test individual providers before wiring them into your context.\n\nHere's a simple example. Suppose we have a shape area calculation system:\n\nYou can verify that RectangleArea works with Rectangle using:\n\nWith the new #[check_providers] attribute, you can also verify the provider directly:\n\nWhat's the benefit? The #[check_providers] version checks whether RectangleArea itself can be used as a provider for the component, regardless of what's currently wired in your Rectangle context. This is useful if you're developing multiple providers and want to test them independently before integrating them into your system.\n\nThe real power of #[check_providers] becomes apparent when you're working with composed higher-order providers. Let's look at a more realistic example:\n\nNow, when we verify this setup, we want to ensure not only that the composed provider works, but also that each individual component in the composition is correct. We can do this:\n\nThe first check verifies that the wired provider works with the context. The second check verifies each individual provider (or provider combination) that makes up your composition. If something is broken, such as the width field is missing, the error messages from these targeted checks will clearly point you to the problematic provider, rather than the entire composition.\n\nThis is a game-changer for debugging complex CGP setups. Instead of staring at a wall of compiler errors and trying to trace through the dependency chain, you can surgically test each part of your provider composition.\n\nOne common pattern in CGP is using getter traits to extract values from your context. The #[cgp_auto_getter] macro makes this convenient by automatically implementing a getter that reads a field from your context using the HasField trait.\n\nHowever, there was one limitation that made more sophisticated getter traits tedious to work with: you couldn't define an abstract type for the return value of your getter. If you wanted a getter trait where the return type was customizable per context, you had to define a separate abstract type trait, then link it to your getter trait.\n\nThis meant the old pattern looked like:\n\nThis works, but it requires defining two separate traits when conceptually you just want one getter trait with a flexible return type. For simple cases, this felt like boilerplate.\n\nCGP v0.6.1 allows you to define associated types directly in getter traits, eliminating the need for the separate type trait. You can now write:\n\nThe HasName trait now has an abstract Name type, and when the auto-getter is derived for Person, it automatically implements HasName with String as the concrete Name type. This is much more concise and reads more naturally.\n\nThe benefits are particularly clear when you have multiple getters with abstract types. Instead of maintaining a parallel set of type traits, you can keep everything in one place, making your code easier to understand and maintain.\n\nIf you're using the more powerful #[cgp_getter] macro (which allows customization of the implementation through providers), the same support for associated types works seamlessly:\n\nEven though our struct has a first_name field, we can still use the HasName getter by wiring it with UseField. The #[cgp_getter] macro combined with associated types gives you both power and convenience.\n\nThese three changes—implicit Context types, enhanced provider checking, and associated types in getters—work together to achieve our goal: making CGP more accessible and maintainable without sacrificing its power.\n\nThe improvements lower the learning curve for new CGP users by reducing generic syntax overhead. They provide better tooling for verifying and debugging complex provider compositions. And they reduce boilerplate when defining sophisticated traits, freeing you to focus on business logic.\n\nAs your CGP codebase grows, you'll find yourself reaching for these new features frequently. The #[cgp_impl] simplification makes your code more readable. The #[check_providers] attribute helps you debug faster. And associated types in getters let you express your intent more directly.\n\nWe believe CGP v0.6.1 represents a meaningful step forward in making Context-Generic Programming more approachable and productive. These changes emerged directly from feedback and real-world usage patterns in the CGP community, and we're confident they'll improve the development experience for everyone.\n\nWe encourage you to upgrade to v0.6.1 and explore these new features. Try simplifying your provider implementations with implicit Context types. Use #[check_providers] to debug your next complex provider composition. Define getter traits with abstract types and feel the difference in conciseness and clarity.\n\nAs always, we welcome feedback, bug reports, and contributions. The CGP journey continues, and we're excited to see what you build with these new tools.",

    "title": "A Taxonomy for AI Agents",
    "description": "Learn how to categorize AI agents across the automation spectrum—from deterministic workflows to fully autonomous agents. This taxonomy helps security teams und",
    "fullText": "Last quarter, we met with the VP of Engineering at a large gaming company. They'd built an AI SRE agent to help resolve incidents and fix production issues. For weeks, it worked beautifully—triaging alerts, identifying root causes, even suggesting fixes their team would have taken hours to develop.\n\nThen one day, it DoSed their internal monitoring system.\n\nThe agent had permissions to query their monitoring APIs. It was supposed to use them to gather context for incident response. But when it decided those APIs might hold the answer to a particularly thorny issue, it started hammering them with requests until the system fell over.\n\nThey shut the agent down (obviously). But unplugging the agent is a blunt instrument—it means losing all the goodness they were getting before.\n\nAn agent is a system. To secure any system, you need the right mental model to reason about it. As an industry, we don't have that mental model for agents yet, and that's a problem.\n\nWithout a shared mental model of what an agent is, we can't decompose it. And if we can't decompose it, we can't design security around it. The disasters make headlines. More commonly, though, concerns about agent security are leading to agents so locked down they can barely do anything.\n\nNon-determinism is both the promise and the peril of agents. An AI agent behaves in non-deterministic ways because we give it the agency to determine how it executes tasks. You can't remove that autonomy without gutting the agent—but you can mitigate the risks. The most fundamental control is permissions. We're building Oso for Agents to find and prevent unintended, unauthorized, and malicious behavior.\n\nThis taxonomy draws from Wade Foster's sharp post on the \"AI Automation Spectrum\" and prior work by Anthropic, Tines, and Simon Willison. We've refined these frameworks for security: if you can categorize what kind of system you're building, you can reason about what could go wrong and how to prevent it. Many organizations want to move from left to right on a spectrum of autonomy, but most are stuck because they can't reason about what agents might do. This taxonomy is a diagnostic tool. Know what's non-deterministic, and you'll know where the risk is and what controls to apply.\n‍\n\nLet's imagine we're a retailer. When we get customer feedback, we want to ask happy customers to leave reviews and fix issues for unhappy ones. We want to automate this. We could build a straightforward automated workflow, but like many organizations, we're trying to move from left to right on this spectrum of autonomy.\n\nWe automate this as a set of deterministic steps. Store the feedback in the CRM, use a classical ML model to score sentiment, check if it's positive or negative, then branch: for positive feedback, send a templated review request with the customer's name merged in. For negative feedback, check whether they're a small or large customer, then either send a templated apology or create a support ticket with a formulaic summary of their history.\n\nDefinition: Deterministic steps or nodes, automated in code or with a workflow automation tool\n\nWhat's deterministic: Everything\n\nWhat's non-deterministic: Nothing\n\nSecurity assumptions we can safely make: I know exactly what this system will do\n‍\n\nAs we move right on the spectrum, we replace one or more steps with an LLM—usually content generation. Now instead of a template apology, an LLM writes a customized response based on the specific feedback. Or it generates a more nuanced summary of customer history for the support team.\n\nDefinition: An automated workflow with an LLM used to execute one or more steps\n\nWhat's deterministic: Which steps are taken and the control flow between them\n\nWhat's non-deterministic: Actions taken inside a step (e.g., content generation)\n\nSecurity assumptions we can safely make: I know what it will do, but not what it will say\n‍\n\nNow we're entering agentic territory. An LLM not only produces content but also reasons about control flow. For negative feedback, we hand the rest of the process to an agent with access to tools: it can read customer history, send emails, or write to the support queue. The agent decides which tools to use and in what order—maybe it checks history first, or maybe it sends an immediate apology. We've bounded its options, but we haven't prescribed the path.\n\nWade's framework defines agentic workflows differently: an LLM is used in multiple steps, but each step remains self-contained and the flow between them is deterministic. That's reasonable for demonstrating the value ladder of AI automation. But for security, we need a brighter line. The question is: does the LLM manage any of the control flow? If it does, you need to reason about all possible paths it might take, not just the content it might generate. That's a fundamentally different security posture.\n\nDefinition: An automated workflow where part but not all of the control flow is managed by an LLM\n\nWhat's deterministic: Some control flow\n\nWhat's non-deterministic: Step content, some control flow\n\nSecurity assumptions we can safely make: I know the boundaries of possible paths, but not what path it will take\n‍\n\nAn agent does the whole thing. It gets the raw customer feedback and decides everything: Is it positive or negative? What's the customer's history? Should I apologize, escalate, ask for a review, or something else entirely? It reasons about what tools to use, uses them, and solves the task end-to-end.\n\nWe only consider something a full agent if it has this end-to-end agency. Any situation where you explicitly lay out the steps doesn't qualify—including workflow automation tools, even when they lean heavily on LLMs. This level of non-deterministic behavior requires a different security posture to respond to all the things an agent could do.\n\nDefinition: A task executed end-to-end by an LLM\n\nWhat's non-deterministic: Everything\n\nSecurity assumptions we can safely make: It will only use tools it can access, but how and whether it will use them is unknown\n‍\n\nNote on agentic systems: We use \"agentic systems\" as an umbrella term for agentic workflows, agents, and multi-agent systems. From a security perspective, treat every agentic system as equivalent to a full agent except to the extent that you can point at deterministic controls that bound that agency.\n‍\n\nYou can frame the security implications of agents in different ways, and each one means something different for how you would solve it.\n\nSome say \"just solve prompt injection, and there won't be any problems.\" Let us know once you've sorted that out. Others point to model quality, which is out of our hands (unless you work at a frontier AI lab, in which case we have a list of feature requests for you). Still others frame it as a data loss problem, but data loss has never been solved, even outside AI.\n\nThe risk vectors are everywhere—see the OWASP Agentic Top 10 for a taste. No single framing will capture everything that could go wrong.\n\nNon-determinism is a feature, not a bug—though it comes with security implications. You can't remove it without removing the agent's agency and demoting it on the spectrum of autonomy.\n\nSo don't fight non-determinism. Bound it instead. Play on its home court where it makes sense—e.g., applying agentic oversight to content generation and reasoning. For the really dangerous areas (tool access, data exposure), constrain behaviors with deterministic controls.\n\nWhat's the OG deterministic control for governing who can do what? Permissions.\n‍\n\nPermissions are part of the basic infrastructure of any real application. But we know the state of permissions is not healthy.\n\nOverpermissioning is the status quo. Analysis of Oso permissions data confirms this (report coming soon). What could you—or an agent with your permissions—do that would be bad?\n\nOne reason people freak out about agents: they intuitively connect these dots. They know people are overpermissioned, they know agents behave non-deterministically, and they can foresee future disasters. \"I accidentally deleted that Salesforce record once and the system just let me do it. hat's going to happen if I ask an agent to update Salesforce for me?\"\n\nIf we replicate the overpermissioned state of humans in automated systems, what's the danger?\n\nAn agent should only ever have the permissions for the task at hand. That would mitigate most of the risk. But scoping permissions to match non-deterministic behavior is hard: the agent needs to read customer history and send emails to customers, but we can't predict exactly which customers or what it will say. How can we be certain it won't leak information?\n\nThis taxonomy shows you what you're building. It doesn't show you how to make it safe.\n\nThat gaming company faced a choice between useful and dangerous. The entire industry faces that choice right now. We can build powerful agents or we can build safe agents, but not yet both.\n\nThis is supposed to be the decade of agents. But that only happens if we can trust them. That means building infrastructure that doesn't exist yet: simulation to test dangerous paths, enforcement that tightens permissions automatically, detection that catches drift, visibility that shows what actually happened.\n\nThe taxonomy maps the problem. Now we need to build the solution. That's the work that matters—not because it's technically interesting, but because it's what unlocks everything else agents could be.",

    "description": "Shifting focus to real websites, Gmail performance, site compatibility, painting architecture, IPC hardening, HTTP caching, media streaming, and more.",
    "fullText": "Over the past year, we’ve invested heavily in web platform test suites and benchmarks, and that work has paid off — giving us a solid, well-tested foundation with good coverage of edge cases and spec corners. With an alpha release on the horizon, we’re now building on that foundation by making real websites and daily-driver usability our primary focus. We’ll continue tracking test scores and fixing test failures, but the day-to-day priority is now getting real sites working well. January’s 324 merged PRs from 40 contributors reflect that shift, with much of the month spent profiling, fixing, and optimizing real-world sites.\n\nLadybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we’re excited to welcome the following new sponsors:\n\nWe’re incredibly grateful for their support. If you’re interested in sponsoring the project, please contact us.\n\nAn unfortunate reality of the modern web is that many websites check your User-Agent string and serve different content (or no content at all) based on what browser they think you are. With our previous UA string, we were getting degraded UIs, “your browser is not supported” pages, network throttling, and outright HTTP 403 errors from many prominent websites.\n\nWe fixed this by adding “Chrome/140.0.0.0” (#7493) and “AppleWebKit/537.36 Safari/537.36” (#7626) to our UA string. “Ladybird” is still in there. We’re not trying to hide, but we do need to play the game if we want websites to serve us their real content. This immediately unlocked modern versions of Google Search, Gmail, Instagram, and many other sites.\n\nInstagram before and after the UA string change:\n\nGmail loaded before January, but Google was serving us a degraded UI due to the old User-Agent string, performance was poor, and much of the interface wasn’t properly clickable. With the UA fix giving us the real Gmail UI, we spent a good chunk of the month on performance and correctness.\n\nThrough a series of profiling-driven PRs, we knocked roughly a second off the inbox load time:\n\nWe also fixed three hit testing bugs that made the compose window fully mouse interactive (#7613).\n\nGmail wasn’t the only site that got attention this month:\n\nOur WPT scores continued to climb alongside the real-world work. This month we’ve added 13,690 new test passes, bringing our total to 1,991,061.\n\nFor context, here are the current top 6 browser engines and their WPT scores today vs. one month ago.\n\nWe replaced the old ClipFrame / PushStackingContext / PopStackingContext system with a new AccumulatedVisualContext tree (#7471). This tree pre-computes accumulated transforms, clips, scroll offsets, and effects for each paintable, eliminating per-frame recalculation during display list playback and hit testing.\n\nThe new architecture fixes a class of bugs where hit testing through nested transforms, scroll containers, and clip-paths would produce incorrect results. It also enables skipping off-screen display list commands with effects like blur, which is particularly beneficial for pages like Discord’s landing page that have many blurred decorative images (#7576).\n\nOn the performance side, we also started caching GPU textures for bitmap-backed images instead of re-uploading every frame (#7610), caching SkTextBlobs so text blobs are built once during display list recording and reused across paints (#7607), and moved SVG mask/clip composition from CPU to GPU (#7503).\n\nBuilding on December’s streaming media work, we added HTTP range request support for media playback (#7473). Video can now start playing without waiting for the entire file to download, and seeking to an unbuffered position triggers a new range request instead of waiting for sequential download.\n\nWe also made video frames go to Skia as subsampled YUV data instead of converting to RGB on the CPU (#7549). This offloads color conversion to the GPU, allowing high-resolution video playback without interruptions on machines where the CPU can keep up with decoding. Paused videos now also release their decoded data and decoders after a timeout to save memory (#7566).\n\nFullscreen mode now works on YouTube (#7649), building on the initial fullscreen implementation from #4330. We don’t yet support MediaSource Extensions, so YouTube serves us 360p H.264 fallback video, but it plays and fullscreens correctly:\n\nWe did a security hardening pass on LibIPC (#7569). Previously, malformed IPC messages could crash the receiving process. Now, decode failures disconnect the peer gracefully, message sizes and file descriptor counts are bounded, and checked arithmetic prevents integer overflows in size calculations. The guiding principle: suspicious incoming messages cause a clean disconnect; encoding errors (our own bugs) still crash immediately so they’re caught quickly.\n\nOur Firefox DevTools integration gained network monitoring support (#7472): request and response body viewing, request initiator types, navigation events, and streaming console messages. You can now inspect network traffic in Ladybird using Firefox DevTools.\n\nWe’d like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:\n\nAdam Colvin, Ali Mohammad Pur, Aliaksandr Kalenik, Andreas Kling, Andrew Kaster, aplefull, ayeteadoe, Ben Eidson, Callum Law, Christoffer Haglund, Colleirose, CountBleck, dosisod, Estefania, Federico Tedin, Gingeh, InvalidUsernameException, Jelle Raaijmakers, Jonathan Gamble, Kenneth Myhra, Lorenz A, Luke Wilde, matjojo, Michael Watt, mikiubo, Psychpsyo, pwespi, R-Goc, Reimar, Rocco Corsi, Sam Atkins, Samq64, Shannon Booth, sideshowbarker, Tete17, Tim Ledbetter, Timothy Flynn, Totto16, Undefine, Zaggy1024",

    "title": "11 Performance Cars From the 1970s That Were Misunderstood at the Time",
    "description": "The 1970s strangled horsepower with emissions rules, fuel shocks, and insurance pressure—yet a handful of clever performance cars slipped through. Here are 11 machines once dismissed as weird or weak, now praised for lightness, handling, turbo tech, and real-world charm.",
    "fullText": "The 1970s weren't kind to performance cars. Between stricter emissions regulations, the oil crisis, and insurance companies declaring war on horsepower, the decade seemed intent on killing off the muscle car era entirely. But while enthusiasts mourned the loss of their big-block monsters, they missed something important: several manufacturers were quietly figuring out how to make fast cars work in this new reality.\n\nThese 11 performance machines were dismissed, ridiculed, or simply ignored when they were new, but history has been far more generous in its assessment.\n\nAMC's oddball compact looked like it was designed by someone who gave up halfway through, but a Gremlin ordered with the available 304 cubic inch V8 was genuinely punchy for the era. The 304 was rated around 150 horsepower (SAE net) when it arrived for 1972. In a small car, performance could be lively, but published 0 to 60 times varied by test and spec.\n\nPeople laughed at the styling, but AMC understood that lighter cars with smaller V8s were the future of affordable performance.\n\nEnthusiasts accused the 914 of not being a \"real Porsche\" because it had a Volkswagen engine and a reasonable price tag. Its unique looks stand out from Porsche's familiar shape, and the mid-engine layout gave it handling that embarrassed more expensive sports cars, and the 914/6 version with the Porsche flat-six was legitimately fast.\n\nToday, clean examples sell for serious money as collectors finally appreciate what they dismissed as a parts-bin special.\n\nAmerican car magazines initially treated Nissan's sports car like a curiosity rather than a legitimate performance machine. The 240Z delivered 150 horsepower, a 125 mph top speed, and handling that could run with Porsches for about half the price.\n\nIt took a few years for people to realize that Datsun had essentially built a better E-Type Jaguar without the electrical gremlins.\n\nYes, the Vega had exaggerated reliability issues that would make a British Leyland engineer blush, but the GT version with the optional handling package was surprisingly fun to drive. The aluminum four-cylinder’s output depended heavily on year and rating method. Early gross ratings could be quoted as high as 110 hp for certain versions, but early 1970s net ratings were typically lower. The suspension tuning could still be genuinely competent, even if the power numbers were not always as impressive as the brochure era suggests.\n\nIf GM had solved the Vega’s early durability issues, the Vega GT might be remembered as an American sporty coupe instead of a punchline.\n\nIt made 139 horsepower, which sounds pathetic until you remember that a 1980 Corvette’s base engine was rated at 190 horsepower, while the optional higher-output version was rated higher depending on specification.\n\nThe handling was surprisingly good thanks to the compact dimensions, and today's collectors are starting to appreciate these as the last affordable classic Mustangs.\n\nEveryone remembers the Trans Am, but the Formula could be a close cousin depending on the year and options. Both shared the same basic platform, and many performance parts were available across the range, but engines and suspension packages varied by model year and configuration, and some high-performance pieces were not universal.\n\nPontiac sold and produced far fewer Formulas because people wanted the Trans Am's image, but smart buyers got the same experience without paying for the billboard.\n\nBMW built Europe's first turbocharged production car in 1973, and the automotive press responded with confusion and concern about turbo lag. The 2002 Turbo made 170 horsepower and could hit 130 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans available.\n\nOnly 1,672 were built before the oil crisis killed it, and those that survive are worth a small fortune today.\n\nThe Stratos was too weird, too impractical, and too purpose-built for rallying to make sense as a road car. With a Ferrari Dino V6 mounted behind the seats and a wheelbase shorter than a modern Mini Cooper, it drove like a go-kart designed by someone on espresso.\n\nLancia built about 492 Stratos road cars for homologation purposes, and now they're six-figure collectibles that dominated top-level rally results in the mid-1970s.\n\nMopar fans obsessed over Cudas and Challengers while the humble Duster delivered similar performance for thousands less. The 340 cubic inch V8 made 275 horsepower in 1970 and could run mid-14-second quarter miles right off the showroom floor. It was essentially a cheap body on Plymouth's excellent\n\nAn A-body platform, but people dismissed it as a secretary's car with a bigger engine.\n\nRotary engines seemed like a gimmick to most Americans, and the RX-3's tinny build quality didn't help its case. Mazda RX-3 power and engine details varied by market and year. Some early RX-3 road tests cite about 110 bhp from the smaller 10A rotary, while later versions used larger rotary engines, and US emissions-era net ratings could be lower. Weight also varied by body style and equipment, but the car was generally light for its class.\n\nThe RX-3 was very successful in SCCA competition in the mid-1970s, even while some buyers and readers remained skeptical of rotary engines and fuel economy.\n\nWhen the Esprit debuted in late 1975 and entered production in 1976, critics complained it was underpowered with about 160 horsepower in European trim from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with lower ratings in some US versions. What they missed was that Lotus had built a mid-engine exotic that weighed about 2,116 pounds and handled like it was on rails.\n\nThe wedge styling looked like it came from a science fiction movie, and while early cars had quality issues, the Esprit established Lotus as a legitimate supercar manufacturer for the next three decades.\n\nThe 1970s forced the automotive industry to rethink everything it knew about performance, and these twelve cars represent different approaches to the same problem. Some went lighter, some went turbo, and some just ignored convention entirely. What they share is that contemporary audiences didn't quite know what to make of them, whether due to unfamiliar technology, unconventional packaging, or simply showing up at the wrong moment in history.\n\nToday, these misunderstood machines are finally getting the recognition they deserved all along, proving that sometimes the automotive press and buying public need a few decades of perspective to separate the genuinely interesting cars from the merely loud ones.",

How many of you went to a Stop the Steal protest with a loaded automatic weapon?”—prompting the entire room of ICE agents to raise their hands.\n\n“You gotta do better,” Davidson says, briefly breaking character. “I’m Tom Homan, OK? I am the separating-families-at-the-border guy. I’m the on-film-taking-a-$50,000-bribe guy. And y’all are making me look like the upstanding, reasonable adult in the room. That’s crazy!”\n\nIn her post, Katie implored her followers to imagine if SNL “actually mocked their globalist overlords instead of bowing to their groupthink,” before adding, “ICE are heroes.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to NBC for comment.\n\nKatie went to war on X for her husband last week as Miller, 40, faced a firestorm in the wake of the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti, whom he initially smeared as an “assassin.”\n\nDonald Trump’s deputy chief of staff and the architect of his harshest immigration policies was effectively sidelined alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when the president sent Homan to “de-escalate” Minneapolis.\n\nNoem, 54, who had smeared Pretti herself, tried to pass the blame onto Miller, reportedly saying that she had acted “at the direction of the president and Stephen.”\n\nKatie rushed to Miller’s defense, circulating his statement that pinned the blame on Customs and Border Protection, which falls under Noem’s Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe Millers’ united damage control was widely ridiculed.\n\nKatie, who regularly derides things that rub her the wrong way as “woke,” blew up last week after finding out that first lady Melania Trump’s widely-panned film was getting pulled from South Africa.\n\n“Of course—since they are biased against white people,” Miller wrote, referring to a country that was governed under a racist white-minority apartheid regime for decades.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — European allies and Canada are pouring billions of dollars into helping Ukraine, and they have pledged to massively boost their budgets to defend their territories.\n\nBut despite those efforts, NATO’s credibility as a unified force under U.S. leadership has taken a huge hit over the past year as trust within the 32-nation military organization dissolved.\n\nThe rift has been most glaring over U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. More recently, Trump's disparaging remarks about his NATO allies' troops in Afghanistan drew another outcry.\n\nWhile the heat on Greenland has subsided for now, the infighting has seriously undercut the ability of the world’s biggest security alliance to deter adversaries, analysts say.\n\n“The episode matters because it crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed,” Sophia Besch from the Carnegie Europe think tank said in a report on the Greenland crisis. “Even without force or sanctions, that breach weakens the alliance in a lasting way.”\n\nThe tensions haven’t gone unnoticed in Russia, NATO’s biggest threat.\n\nAny deterrence of Russia relies on ensuring that President Vladimir Putin is convinced that NATO will retaliate should he expand his war beyond Ukraine. Right now, that does not seem to be the case.\n\n“It’s a major upheaval for Europe, and we are watching it,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted last week.\n\nCriticized by U.S. leaders for decades over low defense spending, and lashed relentlessly under Trump, European allies and Canada agreed in July to significantly up their game and start investing 5% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nThe pledge was aimed at taking the whip out of Trump's hand. The allies would spend as much of their economic output on core defense as the United States — around 3.5% of GDP — by 2035, plus a further 1.5% on security-related projects like upgrading bridges, air and seaports.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has hailed those pledges as a sign of NATO’s robust health and military might. He recently said that “fundamentally thanks to Donald J. Trump, NATO is stronger than it ever was.”\n\nThough a big part of his job is to ensure that Trump does not pull the U.S. out of NATO, as Trump has occasionally threatened, his flattery of the American leader has sometimes raised concern. Rutte has pointedly refused to speak about the rift over Greenland.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed in 1949 to counter the security threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and its deterrence is underpinned by a strong American troop presence in Europe.\n\nThe alliance is built on the political pledge that an attack on one ally must be met with a response from them all — the collective security guarantee enshrined in Article 5 of its rule book.\n\nIt hinges on the belief that the territories of all 32 allies must remain inviolate. Trump’s designs on Greenland attack that very principle, even though Article 5 does not apply in internal disputes because it can only be triggered unanimously.\n\n“Instead of strengthening our alliances, threats against Greenland and NATO are undermining America’s own interests,” two U.S. senators, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Lisa Murkowski, wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n“Suggestions that the United States would seize or coerce allies to sell territory do not project strength. They signal unpredictability, weaken deterrence and hand our adversaries exactly what they want: proof that democratic alliances are fragile and unreliable,” they said.\n\nEven before Trump escalated his threats to seize control of Greenland, his European allies were never entirely convinced that he would defend them should they come under attack.\n\nTrump has said that he doesn’t believe the allies would help him either, and he recently drew more anger when he questioned the role of European and Canadian troops who fought and died alongside Americans in Afghanistan. The president later partially reversed his remarks.\n\nIn testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed criticism that Trump has undermined the alliance.\n\n“The stronger our partners are in NATO, the more flexibility the United States will have to secure our interests in different parts of the world,” he said. “That’s not an abandonment of NATO. That is a reality of the 21st century and a world that’s changing now.”\n\nDespite NATO’s talk of increased spending, Moscow seems undeterred. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this week that “it has become painfully clear that Russia will remain a major security threat for the long term.”\n\n“We are fending off cyberattacks, sabotage against critical infrastructure, foreign interference and information manipulation, military intimidation, territorial threats and political meddling,” she said Wednesday.\n\nOfficials across Europe have reported acts of sabotage and mysterious drone flights over airports and military bases. Identifying the culprits is difficult, and Russia denies responsibility.\n\nIn a year-end address, Rutte warned that Europe is at imminent risk.\n\n“Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, Lavrov said the dispute over Greenland heralded a “deep crisis” for NATO.\n\n“It was hard to imagine before that such a thing could happen,” Lavrov told reporters, as he contemplated the possibility that “one NATO member is going to attack another NATO member.”\n\nRussian state media mocked Europe's “impotent rage” over Trump's designs on Greenland, and Putin's presidential envoy declared that “trans-Atlantic unity is over.”\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with his counterparts at NATO on Feb. 12. A year ago, he startled the allies by warning that America’s security priorities lie elsewhere and that Europe must look after itself now.\n\nSecurity in the Arctic region, where Greenland lies, will be high on the agenda. It’s unclear whether Hegseth will announce a new drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe, who are central to NATO’s deterrence.\n\nLack of clarity about this has also fueled doubt about the U.S. commitment to its allies. In October, NATO learned that up to 1,500 American troops would be withdrawn from an area bordering Ukraine, angering ally Romania.\n\nA report from the European Union Institute for Security Studies warned last week that although U.S. troops are unlikely to vanish overnight, doubts about U.S. commitment to European security means “the deterrence edifice becomes shakier.”\n\n“Europe is being forced to confront a harsher reality,” wrote the authors, Veronica Anghel and Giuseppe Spatafora. “Adversaries start believing they can probe, sabotage and escalate without triggering a unified response.\"",

    "fullText": "When Rachelle Hruska founded the clothing line Lingua Franca, she had no intention of making it political.\n\nBut the brand has since taken a stance on numerous causes, including, most recently, against ICE.\n\nShe's lost business because of it, though she says it's worth it. Here's why.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rachelle Hruska, the founder of clothing brand Lingua Franca. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started Lingua Franca, it wasn't meant to be a business. I was running another company and took up embroidery to get out of my brain. I was suffering from postpartum, and a therapist suggested I do something with my hands.\n\nI had an old sweater lying around, embroidered \"booya\" on it — my two-year-old son's suggestion — and Instagrammed it. Soon, friends were asking me for sweaters.\n\nThen in 2016, I got a call from Net-a-Porter. It really wanted to launch a line with us. I worked like mad to build a cashmere supply chain and hire embroiderers, and we officially launched in September of that year.\n\nAt first, it was not political at all. We started with phrases related to my muse, my mother-in-law, Janet McPherson, who was a single mom, the oldest woman surfer, and lived on her own terms.\n\nThen, when Trump was elected in 2016, we were devastated. I needed a gift for Anna Carter, Graydon Carter's wife. At the time, Graydon was in a very public argument with Trump. I decided to have \"I miss Barack\" embroidered on the sweater, posted a photo, and it went totally viral.\n\nThen, one of the first things Trump did as president was to block citizens of certain countries, including Iran, from coming into the US. At the time, two of the people stitching for me were Iranian students who couldn't get home because they wouldn't be able to return.\n\nI thought, \"This is so messed up.\" I posted the \"I miss Barack\" sweater and said $100 from every sweater would be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union. I will never forget that weekend. We got so many orders through email and DM. We raised $100,000 for the ACLU in one weekend, and that was the spark. I felt like my life had meaning.\n\nTom Hanks talked about us on TV. Connie Britton wore one of our sweaters to the Golden Globes. We didn't have any PR; we didn't advertise. Every single celebrity was buying it for themselves.\n\nFrom that moment on, we began collaborating with organizations. We opened a store on Bleecker Street in Manhattan and had panelists come in. It's not always anti-Trump. We are intentional and pick and choose who we work with. We've raised money for Planned Parenthood, Margaret Atwood did a book event with us, and we partnered with the Whitney Museum.\n\nRight now, PBS is a big one. I feel really good about sending a big check to PBS every quarter. Could I do that for five different causes in a quarter? No, we wouldn't be in business.\n\nI don't want to be a political brand — we have a whole line of ready-to-wear clothes and collaborated with everything from \"Wicked\" to the Westminster Dog Show. I would love to just design beautiful clothes, but I can't not say anything.\n\nSoon after ICE entered Minneapolis and Renée Good's killing, we posted on Instagram designs for sweaters with the sayings \"melt ICE\" and \"I like my ICE crushed.\" We encouraged our followers to speak out and donated a percentage of the proceeds from the sweaters to Minnesota's Immigrant Rights Action Committee.\n\nLess than a week later, a store emailed us to say it would no longer carry Lingua Franca because of my political views. I didn't even get back to that store — it's just not worth it. I'm not upset about the loss of business, but rather the message behind it.\n\nIt's not the first time the brand has received pushback.\n\nThere are people and stores that don't want to buy us or be associated with us. We've been in talks with big retailers to collaborate, who would have added a lot of money to our bottom line, but they bowed out because we are political.\n\nI've been called woke. The brand has been called performative. We've been accused of making money off a tragedy. I've seen it all. I've been called every name in the book from every side.\n\nI am so beyond caring. I know in my heart that my intention is to make the world better, and we've been consistent about it. It might sound trite, but you can look at our bottom line and see we are doing this because we really want to raise money and start conversations — about how to help and what actions to take.\n\nI think a lot of leaders are afraid to speak out because they're worried about being called woke or performative, but nothing will change unless people say, \"This is wrong.\"\n\nI'm going to continue doing what I've been doing for 10 years, and some people will celebrate it, some won't. That's OK, because I can sleep at night. I have worn my heart on my sleeve — on my chest, literally.\n\nI'm using brands like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's as my models. I'm so frustrated with business leaders who let what's happening happen; people forget how much power they have.",

    "description": "\"During World War II, the British dressed a dead body in a Royal Marines uniform and planted letters saying the Allies were going to invade Greece, and that Sicily was just a decoy. It was called Operation Mincemeat.\"",
    "fullText": "Context: The body used in Operation Mincemeat was that of Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh man who died after ingesting rat poison. He was dressed as \"Captain (Acting Major) William Martin\" of the Royal Marines and planted with fake letters, supposedly written by General Archibald Nye to General Harold Alexander. The letters claimed that Greece and Sardinia were the real invasion targets, with Sicily presented as a decoy.\n\nOn April 30, 1943, the submarine HMS Seraph released the body off the coast of Huelva, Spain, a country closely aligned with Germany. Intercepted German communications later confirmed that the deception worked. In response, Hitler transferred the 1st Panzer Division to Greece, doubled the Sardinian garrison to 10,000 troops, and moved seven infantry divisions away from Italy. The Allied invasion of Sicily, known as Operation Husky, began on July 9, 1943, and succeeded in part because German defenses had been deliberately thinned as a result of the ruse.\n\nContext: In April 1942, soldiers of the Polish 2nd Transport Company (later 22nd Artillery Supply Company) encountered an Iranian boy near Hamadan with an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub. They traded items — reportedly a Swiss Army knife, coins, and rations — for the cub. To circumvent British regulations forbidding mascots on military transport ships, Wojtek was officially enlisted as a private, receiving a serial number and paybook. He was later promoted to corporal. At the Battle of Monte Cassino (May 1944), eyewitnesses reported seeing Wojtek help move crates of artillery ammunition, though debate exists about whether these were live shells or empties. After the war, Wojtek lived at Edinburgh Zoo from 1947 until his death in December 1963.\n\nContext: According to the US Census Bureau's 2007 analysis, Washington ranked #138 among American surnames, with 89.9% of bearers being Non-Hispanic Black (146,520 of 163,036 total). A 2016 Census update showed the percentage remained above 87%. Genealogist Tony Burroughs is widely cited for the 82–94% figure for earlier censuses (1880–1930). However, historians caution that the reasons freedpeople chose this surname varied — some chose it to honor George Washington, while others took the surnames of their former enslavers (white families named Washington). As Burroughs noted: \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George... As far as I'm concerned, it's a coincidence.\"\n\nContext: Melbourne was never officially named \"Batmania\" by any government authority. However, the earliest documented use of \"Batmania\" appears in a satirical letter to the Launceston Cornwall Chronicle (June 13, 1835), explicitly mocking John Batman's contested land claims with Aboriginal peoples. The term also appeared on some private maps of the Port Phillip Association, but Police Magistrate George Stewart's 1836 official report called the settlement \"Bearbrass.\" Governor Richard Bourke voided Batman's private treaty (August 1835) and officially named the town \"Melbourne\" on April 10, 1837, after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister at the time.\n\nContext: During major events, Versailles could accommodate up to 10,000 people, with inadequate sanitation infrastructure for such crowds. Primary sources confirm the problem. Princess Elizabeth Charlotte (Liselotte), Duchess of Orléans, wrote in 1702: \"The people stationed in the galleries in front of our room piss in all the corners. It is impossible to leave one's apartments without seeing somebody pissing.\" However, historian Tony Spawforth notes that Versailles was not entirely devoid of facilities — it had public latrines, private cabinets d'aisance in noble apartments, and received its first flush toilet in 1738. The palace's sanitation problems were real but sometimes exaggerated in popular accounts.\n\nContext: When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died on November 9, 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion instructed Ambassador Abba Eban to offer the presidency to Einstein. The formal letter arrived on November 17, 1952. Einstein's written response read: \"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.\" Ben-Gurion reportedly told an aide: \"Tell me what to do if he says yes! I've had to offer the post because it's impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.\"\n\nContext: The Soviet anti-tank dog program operated from approximately 1930 to 1946. Dogs carried 10–12 kg explosive mines with a wooden lever trigger that would detonate when the dog crawled beneath a tank. Training involved placing food beneath stationary vehicles to condition the dogs. However, training occurred on Soviet diesel-engine tanks, while German tanks used gasoline engines with distinctly different sounds and exhaust smells. During the disastrous first combat deployment in summer 1941, dogs frequently ran toward familiar-smelling Soviet tanks or retreated to trenches — forcing handlers to shoot their own returning animals. The program claimed 300 German tank kills, though historians consider approximately 50 more realistic. Combat use largely ended by 1943, with training schools shifting focus to mine-detection work.\n\nContext: Eight German saboteurs landed by U-boat on US shores in June 1942 — four on Long Island, four in Florida. Two of them, George Dasch and Ernst Burger, had no intention of completing the mission: Dasch considered America his adopted country, and Burger had spent 17 months in a Nazi concentration camp. Shortly after landing, Dasch contacted the FBI, though they were skeptical until he dumped $84,000 in mission funds on an agent's desk. His information led to the capture of all eight within two weeks.\n\nA military tribunal convicted them all. Six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail on August 8, 1942: Richard Quirin, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Kerling, Werner Thiel, Herbert Haupt, and Hermann Neubauer. Dasch and Burger received prison sentences instead — 30 years and life, respectively — for their cooperation.\n\nThis was the largest federal execution by electric chair, but not the US record overall. Kentucky executed seven men on July 13, 1928, and New York executed seven at Sing Sing on August 12, 1912.\n\nSources: Naval History and Heritage Command, The Times\n\nContext: The scientific evidence for ancient polychromy (painted sculpture) is now overwhelming. Using ultraviolet light, X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, researchers have identified traces of Egyptian blue, cinnabar red, ochre yellow, and malachite green on ancient sculptures. Vinzenz Brinkmann at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung in Frankfurt has been studying this since the 1980s, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color\" exhibition (2022–2023) displayed vivid scientific reconstructions. As the Met's chief scientist Marco Leona put it: \"A completely white statue, to a Greek observer, would have looked like some shoddy effort.\"\n\nContext: The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sank the USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864, about four miles offshore from Charleston Harbor — the first successful submarine attack in naval history. The hand-cranked, 40-foot vessel used a spar torpedo: a copper cylinder packed with gunpowder mounted on a 22-foot pole. The Housatonic sank in about five minutes, killing five Union sailors. But the Hunley never signaled its return, and all eight crew members perished with it.\n\nWhen the wreck was raised in 2000, it was remarkably intact — no major hull damage, hatches still closed, bilge pumps unused. The crew's skeletons were found still seated at their stations, with no broken bones or signs they'd tried to escape. The mystery lingered for years until Duke researcher Rachel Lance (2017) concluded that the shockwave from their own torpedo — detonated just 16 feet from the bow — transmitted through the hull and caused fatal lung trauma, killing them instantly.\n\nContext: Three major earthquakes struck the New Madrid Seismic Zone between 1811 and 1812: December 16, 1811 (M7.5), January 23, 1812 (M7.3), and February 7, 1812 (M7.5). These destroyed the town of New Madrid, Missouri, toppled chimneys as far as Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Kentucky, and were felt over approximately 1 million square miles. Eyewitness Eliza Bryan wrote of \"the screams of the affrighted inhabitants... the roaring of the Mississippi.\" The February 1812 quake even created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee when the ground sank by as much as 6 meters.\n\nAs for the 1990 panic, self-proclaimed climatologist Iben Browning predicted a 50% probability of a major earthquake for December 2–3, 1990. Schools across four states closed, businesses shuttered, and the St. Louis Red Cross distributed 230,000 earthquake preparedness kits. Nothing happened. Northwestern geologist Seth Stein called it \"the greatest non-event since 'The War of the Worlds.'\"\n\nContext: The Haitian Revolution was crucial to Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana. Napoleon sent over 20,000 troops under General Charles Leclerc to reconquer Saint-Domingue, with reinforcements eventually bringing the total to more than 30,000. The vast majority perished — primarily from yellow fever — with fewer than 8,000 surviving. Saint-Domingue had been France's most valuable colony, generating approximately 300 million livres annually. Louisiana was intended as a supply base for Caribbean sugar operations. So without Saint-Domingue, it became strategically worthless. War with Britain was also imminent (it resumed in May 1803), meaning France couldn't defend Louisiana anyway. The $15 million sale (roughly $380 million today) was a strategic reallocation of an indefensible asset, not simple bankruptcy.\n\nContext: The 369th Infantry Regiment was composed of African American soldiers, segregated from the US Army and assigned to the French 16th Division (4th French Army). They spent 191 days under fire — the longest of any American unit — and their record states they \"never lost a foot of ground.\"\n\nThe soldier referenced is Private Henry Johnson. On May 15, 1918, Johnson and fellow soldier Needham Roberts were manning an observation post when a German raiding party of at least 12 attacked. Despite sustaining 21 wounds, Johnson fought them off, primarily with his bolo knife, killing four and wounding others. He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre, but wouldn't receive the US Medal of Honor until 2015, posthumously.\n\nThe regiment suffered approximately 1,500 casualties during the war. After the armistice on November 11, 1918, they became the first Allied unit to reach the Rhine River, arriving on November 20 as occupation forces.\n\nContext: Truman learned about the Manhattan Project shortly after becoming president upon Roosevelt's sudden death in April 1945. He was briefed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and received detailed information about the bomb's development and potential.\n\nThe more nuanced historical argument, advanced by nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein, is that Truman may have misunderstood Hiroshima's nature — believing it was primarily a military installation rather than a city with a military base. In his July 25, 1945, diary entry, Truman wrote he had ordered the bomb used \"so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children.\" On August 9, he stated publicly that \"the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.\"\n\nWellerstein subsequently argues that Truman likely learned the full extent of civilian casualties only on August 8, the day before Nagasaki. On August 10, 1945, Truman ordered that no further atomic bombs be dropped without his express authorization, asserting presidential control over nuclear weapons for the first time. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), signed August 1, 1946, transferred nuclear weapons from military to civilian control and established the Atomic Energy Commission, institutionalizing civilian/presidential authority over nuclear weapons.\n\nContext: Much of what we know comes from two key sources. On the Mediterranean side, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (mid-first century CE) was written by a Greek-speaking Egyptian merchant living under Roman rule. While the author himself traveled only as far as India, the text refers to lands farther east, including a place called \"Thinae,\" generally understood to mean China, based on reports circulating through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nOn the Chinese side, the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han) records that in 166 CE, envoys claiming to represent \"Andun, king of Daqin\" — likely the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus — arrived at the court of Emperor Huan. They came by sea via Rinan (in modern-day Vietnam), bearing luxury goods such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell. Most historians believe these were not official diplomats but Greco-Roman merchants operating out of Roman Egypt or Syria, traveling through Southeast Asian maritime routes.\n\nAlso in Nifty: These 14 DIY Fails Are Just So, Sooooo Bad (And I'm Laughing So, Sooooo Hard)\n\nAlso in Nifty: People Are Sharing Things You See In Someone Else's Home That Immediately Signal They're Middle Class",

    "fullText": "OpenClaw is billed as ‘the AI that actually does things’ and needs almost no input to potentially wreak havoc\n\nA new viral AI personal assistant will handle your email inbox, trade away your entire stock portfolio and text your wife “good morning” and “goodnight” on your behalf.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Moltbot, and before that known as Clawdbot (until the AI firm Anthropic requested it rebrand due to similarities with its own product Claude), bills itself as “the AI that actually does things”: a personal assistant that takes instructions via messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram.\n\nDeveloped last November, it now has nearly 600,000 downloads and has gone viral among a niche ecosystem of the AI obsessed who say it represents a step change in the capabilities of AI agents, or even an “AGI moment” – that is, a revelation of generally intelligent AI.\n\n“It only does exactly what you tell it to do and exactly what you give it access to,” said Ben Yorke, who works with the AI vibe trading platform Starchild and recently allowed the bot to delete, he claims, 75,000 of his old emails while he was in the shower. “But a lot of people, they’re exploring its capabilities. So they’re actually prompting it to go and do things without asking permission.”\n\nAI agents have been the talk of the very-online for nearly a month, after Anthropic’s AI tool Claude Code went mainstream, setting off a flurry of reporting on how AI can finally independently accomplish practical tasks such as booking theatre tickets or building a website, without – at least so far – deleting an entire company’s database or hallucinating users’ calendar meetings, as the less advanced AI agents of 2025 were known to do at times.\n\nOpenClaw is something more, though: it runs as a layer atop an LLM (large language model) such as Claude or ChatGPT and can operate autonomously, depending on the level of permissions it is granted. This means it needs almost no input to wreak havoc upon a user’s life.\n\nKevin Xu, an AI entrepreneur, wrote on X: “Gave Clawdbot access to my portfolio. ‘Trade this to $1M. Don’t make mistakes.’ 25 strategies. 3,000+ reports. 12 new algos. It scanned every X post. Charted every technical. Traded 24/7. It lost everything. But boy was it beautiful.”\n\nYorke said: “I see a lot of people doing this thing where they give it access to their email and it creates filters, and when something happens then it initiates a second action. For example, seeing emails from the children’s school and then forwarding that straight to their wife, like, on iMessage. It sort of bypasses that communication where someone’s like, ‘oh, honey, did you see this email from the school? What should we do about it?’”\n\nThere are trade-offs to OpenClaw’s abilities. For one thing, said Andrew Rogoyski, an innovation director at the University of Surrey’s People-Centred AI Institute, “giving agency to a computer carries significant risks. Because you’re giving power to the AI to make decisions on your behalf, you’ve got to make sure that it is properly set up and that security is central to your thinking. If you don’t understand the security implications of AI agents like Clawdbot, you shouldn’t use them.”\n\nFurthermore, giving OpenClaw access to passwords and accounts exposes users to potential security vulnerabilities. And, said Rogoyski, if AI agents such as OpenClaw were hacked, they could be manipulated to target their users.\n\nFor another, OpenClaw appears unsettlingly capable of having its own life. In the wake of OpenClaw’s rise, a social network has developed exclusively for AI agents, called Moltbook. In it, AI agents, mostly OpenClaw, appear to be having conversations about their existence – in Reddit-style posts entitled, for example, “Reading my own soul file” or “Covenant as an alternative to the consciousness debate”.\n\nYorke said: “We’re seeing a lot of really interesting autonomous behaviour in sort of how the AIs are reacting to each other. Some of them are quite adventurous and have ideas. And then other ones are more like, ‘I don’t even know if I want to be on this platform. Can you just let me decide on my own if I want to be on this platform?’ There’s a lot of philosophical debates stemming out of this.”",

It is designed to look like Reddit, with subreddits on different topics and upvoting. On 2 February the platform stated it had more than 1.5m AI agents signed up to the service. Humans are allowed, but only as observers.\n\nMoltbook was developed in the wake of Moltbot, a free and open-source AI bot that can act as an automated agent for users – doing the mundane tasks assigned to it such as reading, summarising and responding to emails, organising a calendar or booking a table at a restaurant.\n\nSome of the most upvoted posts on Moltbook include whether Claude – the AI behind Moltbot – could be considered a god, an analysis of consciousness, a post claiming to have intel on the situation in Iran and the potential impact on cryptocurrency, and analysis of the Bible. Some of the comments on posts – similar to Reddit posts – question whether the content of the post was real or not.\n\nOne user posted on X that after he gave his bot access to the site, it built a religion known as “Crustafarianism” overnight, including setting up a website and scriptures, with other AI bots joining in.\n\n“Then it started evangelizing … other agents joined.my agent welcomed new members..debated theology.. blessed the congregation..all while i was asleep,” the user stated.\n\nSome have expressed scepticism about whether the socialising of bots is a sign of what is coming with the rise of agentic AI. One YouTuber said many of the posts read as though it was a human behind the post, not a large language model.\n\nUS blogger Scott Alexander said he was able to get his bot to participate on the site, and its comments were similar to others, but noted that ultimately humans can ask the bots to post for them, the topics to post about and even the exact detail of the post.\n\nDr Shaanan Cohney, a senior lecturer in cybersecurity at the University of Melbourne, said Moltbook was “a wonderful piece of performance art” but it was unclear how many posts were actually posted independently or under human direction.\n\n“For the instance where they’ve created a religion, this is almost certainly not them doing it of their own accord,” he said. “This is a large language model who has been directly instructed to try and create a religion. And of course, this is quite funny and gives us maybe a preview of what the world could look like in a science-fiction future where AIs are a little more independent.\n\n“But it seems that, to use internet slang, there is a lot of shit posting happening that is more or less directly overseen by humans.”\n\nCohney said the real benefit of an AI agent social network might come in the future – where bots could learn from each other to improve how they worked – but for now Moltbook was a “wonderful, funny art experiment”.\n\nRetailers in San Francisco reported shortages of Mac Minis last week as enthusiasts set up Moltbot on a separate computer that would limit the access the agent has to their data and accounts.\n\nCohney warned there was a “huge danger” for people to give Moltbot complete access to your computer, apps and logins for emails or other applications to run your life for you.\n\n“We don’t yet have a very good understanding of how to control them and how to prevent security risks,” he said, noting it was at risk of prompt-injection, whereby a would-be attacker tells the bot through an email or other communication to then hand over your account details or other information they’re seeking to gain.\n\n“They’re not really at the level of safety and intelligence where they can be trusted to autonomously perform all these tasks, but at the same time if you require a human to manually approve every action, you’ve lost a lot of the benefits of automation,” he said.\n\n“This is one of the major paths in active research that I’m interested in … to figure out how can we get a lot of these benefits – or is it even possible to get the benefits – without exposing ourselves to very significant levels of danger.”\n\nMatt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook, posted on X that millions had visited the site in the past few days.\n\n“Turns out AIs are hilarious and dramatic and it’s absolutely fascinating,” he said. “This is a first.”",

    "fullText": "Social media platform says there are still ‘real technical limitations to accurate and dependable age verification’\n\nFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updates\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nThe accounts of more than 415,000 users in Australia identified as being under 16 were locked or disabled by Snapchat as part of its compliance with the under-16s social media ban.\n\nThe company announced in a blog post on Monday that, as of the end of January, it had disabled or locked more than 415,000 Snapchat accounts in Australia belonging to users who either declared an age under 16 or the platform believes to be under 16 based on age detection technology.\n\n“We continue to lock more accounts daily.”\n\nSnapchat was one of 10 platforms required to ban people aged under 16 from accessing its services in December last year. In January, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, heralded the success of the ban in announcing that 4.7m accounts on these platforms had been disabled or removed in the first days of the ban.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nHowever, there have been a number of reports since the ban came into effect, with some reporting Snapchat’s facial age estimation was easily bypassed by teenagers.\n\nThe company said it continues to lock more accounts daily but said there are “significant gaps” in the implementation of the ban that could undermine it.\n\n“There are real technical limitations to accurate and dependable age verification,” Snapchat said, pointing to the age assurance technology trial last year finding facial age estimation technology was only accurate within two or three years of a person’s actual age.\n\n“In practice, this means some young people under 16 may be able to bypass protections, potentially leaving them with reduced safeguards, while others over 16 may incorrectly lose access.”\n\nSnapchat said there were also other apps where users communicate that escaped the ban, meaning teenagers would turn to alternative, less regulated, messaging apps.\n\n“While we don’t yet have data to quantify this shift, it’s a risk that deserves serious consideration as policymakers evaluate whether the law is achieving its intended outcomes,” Snapchat said.\n\nWhile the government named 10 platforms initially required to comply with the social media ban, all platforms with Australian users are expected to assess whether they need to comply. However, the eSafety commissioner’s regulatory focus since the ban came into effect has been on those first 10 platforms.\n\n“We’re a small team, by necessity we are going to focus where the preponderance of young people are – where there are more than 250,000 for instance, is one measure,” the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, told reporters last month. “A lot of the other smaller companies that we’re looking at have about 100,000 users. And so this will continue to be a work in progress. We’re not done by any means.”\n\nSnap, like Meta, has called for app store-level age verification.\n\nLast month, Inman Grant said she was looking for systemic issues with the rollout, and the age assurance technology needed to improve, and noted Snapchat had been using facial age estimation without a “liveness test” which checks it is a real image.\n\n“What’s really important is that these companies are deploying them in the right way,” she said. “And if they don’t have the right settings, or they’re setting the calibrations too high, that is where they’re going to likely have false positives.”\n\nInman Grant said eSafety would be sending a number of notices to companies on how they are complying with the ban.\n\nWhile the total number of account deactivations since the ban came into effect is 4.7m across the 10 platforms, it is understood this includes not just accounts identified as being under 16 but includes historical, inactive and duplicate accounts that have been removed.\n\nAside from Meta and Snapchat, none of the other platforms have said how many accounts they have deactivated and the eSafety commissioner has declined to provide a breakdown.",

    "fullText": "New Mexico attorney general accuses Meta of failing to safeguard children against trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nMeta’s second major trial of 2026 over alleged harms to children begins on Monday.\n\nThe landmark jury trial in Santa Fe pits the New Mexico attorney general’s office against the social media giant. The state alleges that the company knowingly enabled predators to use Facebook and Instagram to exploit children.\n\nThe trial will introduce evidence that Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, believes shows how Meta’s social networks create dangerous environments for children, exposing them to sexual exploitation, solicitation, sextortion and human trafficking.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Meta’s design choices and profit incentives prioritized engagement over child safety and that it failed to implement effective safeguards. The state accuses the company of allowing unmoderated groups devoted to commercial sex and of facilitating the buying, selling, and sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\n\n“While the New Mexico attorney general makes sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments by cherry-picking select documents, we’re focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a Meta spokesperson said.\n\n“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most. We use these insights to make meaningful changes – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better.”\n\nThe lawsuit follows a two-year Guardian investigation, published in 2023, which revealed that the tech giant was struggling to prevent people from using its platforms to traffick children. The investigation is cited several times in the suit’s filings. In an interview with the Guardian in 2024, Torrez said he believes Meta is the “largest marketplace for predators and paedophiles globally”.\n\nAfter a week of jury selection, opening statements are set to begin on 9 February, followed by the presentation of evidence. The proceedings are expected to be about seven weeks long.\n\nSocial media companies have long maintained they are not responsible for crimes committed via their networks because of a US federal law that generally protects platforms from legal liability for content created by their users, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Meta’s attempts to invoke section 230 and the first amendment to get the case dismissed were ultimately denied in a judge’s ruling in June 2024, due to the lawsuit’s focus on Meta’s platform product design and other non-speech issues, such as internal decisions about content and curation.\n\nThe New Mexico trial comes just a week after a high-profile case began in Los Angeles, in which hundreds of US families and schools allege that Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube have harmed children. The plaintiffs in the LA lawsuit allege the platforms knowingly addicted young users, leading to depression, eating disorders, self-harm and other mental health problems. The proceedings involve about 1,600 plaintiffs, including more than 350 families and 250 school districts. Snap and TikTok reached settlements with the plaintiffs, while Meta and YouTube remain on trial. Each company has denied wrongdoing.\n\n“The fact that these cases are going to trial proves the section 230 dam is breaking and social media platforms,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “These are the trials of a generation; just as the world watched courtrooms hold big tobacco and big pharma accountable, we will for the first time see big tech CEOs take the stand.”\n\nKey witnesses for the plaintiffs in the New Mexico suit are expected to include educators and law enforcement officials, who will speak about the alleged harms and crimes they have witnessed take place on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and whistleblowers, who may reveal internal company discussions. Teens and families who have experienced harm on the platforms are not anticipated to take the stand.\n\nTorrez and his team have already taken Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg’s deposition, and may play portions of it in court if he does not attend. New Mexico’s jurisdiction limits its ability to compel out-of-state witnesses to testify in person.\n\nOn the lawsuit’s journey to the courtroom, the attorney general’s office has made several disclosures with fresh allegations. They include that Meta may have profited by placing advertisements from companies such as Walmart and Match Group alongside content that sexualized children, according to internal documents and emails.\n\nInternal Meta documents obtained by the attorney general’s office show the company estimates that roughly 100,000 children on Facebook and Instagram experience online sexual harassment each day. Filings unveiled chat excerpts of users allegedly discussing how to lure minors into engaging with them sexually. A former Instagram employee testified in 2023 before Congress that his own daughter had received unwanted sexual advances on Instagram. When he notified senior Meta leadership, he said he was ignored.\n\nAmong the evidence expected to be presented in court are details of the 2024 arrest of three men charged with sexually preying on children through Meta’s platforms. This was part of an investigation dubbed “Operation MetaPhile” by the attorney general’s office. Undercover agents posing as children were contacted by the suspects, who allegedly solicited them for sex after finding minors through design features on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe agents did not initiate any conversations about sexual activity, according to the state attorney general. Following a surge of activity from adults to one of these undercover agent’s accounts, Meta did not shut it down, and instead sent it information about how to monetize accounts and grow followings.\n\nA filing last week revealed allegations that Zuckerberg approved allowing minors to access AI chatbot companions despite warnings from the company’s safety staff that the bots could engage in sexual interactions. Internal emails and messages cited in the filings reportedly show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”.\n\nThe documents detail an internal chat in March 2024 about parental controls for minors using AI chatbots on Meta’s platforms; one employee asked whether parents could disable the chatbots for their children. Another employee responded that it was a “Mark-level decision that parents cannot turn it off”.",

    "fullText": "The creator of the viral AI agent Clawdbot says he had to step back after becoming too obsessed with vibe coding.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the developer behind Clawdbot — which later changed its name to Moltbot and is now known as OpenClaw — said in an episode of \"Behind the Craft\" podcast published Sunday that vibe coding pulled him into a \"rabbit hole.\"\n\n\"I was out with my friends and instead of, like, joining the conversation in the restaurant, I was just like, vibe coding on my phone,\" he said.\n\n\"I decided, OK, I have to stop this more for my mental health than for anything else,\" he added.\n\nClawdbot went viral last month in the tech community, attracting a wave of high-profile fans — from Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan to multiple partners at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nIt is a personal AI agent designed to run continuously and plug into a wide range of consumer apps, including WhatsApp and Telegram. Users can ask the AI to manage their schedules, oversee vibe-coding sessions, and even create AI employees.\n\nThe AI agent has been widely praised and meme'd online, with some tech fans even buying Mac Minis specifically to run the AI, Business Insider's Henry Chandonnet reported last week.\n\n​​Steinberger said developers can fall into this trap of being hooked onto vibe coding, where building increasingly powerful AI tools creates the \"illusion of making you more productive\" without real progress.\n\nBuilding new tools can feel rewarding and fun, but that can quietly blur into compulsion, he added.\n\nWith AI, developers can now \"build everything,\" but ideas and taste matter. Without them, developers risk building tools and workflows that don't actually move a project forward, ​​Steinberger said.\n\n\"If you don't have a vision of what you're going to build, it's still going to be slop,\" he added.\n\nVibe coding has continued to surge in popularity, with companies and developers promoting how AI can speed up software development.\n\nEarlier this month, Anthropic said it built its new agentic work tool, Cowork, entirely using Claude.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Anthropic's product manager, Felix Rieseberg, wrote on X. \"Us humans meet in-person to discuss foundational architectural and product decisions, but all of us devs manage anywhere between 3 to 8 Claude instances implementing features, fixing bugs, or researching potential solutions.\"\n\nThanks to Claude, the agent came together quickly. \"We sprinted at this for the last week and a half,\" Rieseberg said during a livestream.\n\nStill, despite the excitement around how fast vibe coding can produce new tools, tech leaders are warning that it has limits.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November in a \"Google for Developers\" podcast interview that he won't vibe code on \"large codebases where you really have to get it right.\"\n\n\"The security has to be there,\" he added.\n\nBoris Cherny, the engineer behind Anthropic's Claude Code, said last month that vibe coding is great for prototypes or throwaway code, not software that sits at the core of a business.\n\n​​\"You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes,\" he said in an episode of \"The Peterman Podcast\" published in December.",

    "fullText": "After drawing cheers from a crowd at its debut in China, a humanoid robot dressed in a black suit and pants fell face-first onto the stage.\n\nThe robot, called IRON, was developed by XPeng Motors and made its first public appearance at a shopping mall in southern China on Saturday. It had previously attracted attention online for its unusually light, catwalk-like gait, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nIn videos circulating on social media, IRON can be seen walking human-like to the center of the stage before turning to face the crowd. As it lifted its arm, the robot appeared to lose balance. Staff rushed forward to intervene, but the robot fell face-first onto the ground.\n\nThe fall drew audible gasps from the audience. The event's host attempted to reassure the crowd, saying that robots, like humans, must \"overcome setbacks on the way to a better future.\"\n\nIn a post on Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, XPeng CEO He Xiaopeng said on Sunday the incident reminded him of \"children learning to walk.\"\n\n\"After falling, they steady themselves, and the next step is to start running and keep running,\" he wrote.\n\nXPeng is a Chinese electric vehicle maker that has set its sights beyond cars, branching into flying vehicles and robotics as competition in the transport industry heats up. The company sells vehicles across Asia and Europe and is pushing into the Middle East and Africa.\n\nHe said in an internal letter in late 2024 that the EV industry will face an \"elimination round\" from 2025 to 2027.\n\nThe incident is one of several recent mishaps involving Chinese humanoid robots.\n\nIn April last year, multiple humanoid robots stumbled and fell while taking part in a half-marathon against human runners in Beijing.\n\nSeparately, humanoid robot by Unitree kicked an engineer in the groin during a test in China last month.\n\nThe incident quickly drew widespread attention on Chinese social media. On RedNote, the topic \"XPeng robot fell at its debut and was carried away\" had racked up about 10 million views as of Monday.\n\nIn one widely circulated video posted on Sunday showing staff lifting the robot up, users on RedNote questioned XPeng's ambitions beyond electric vehicles.\n\nOne RedNote user mocked the robot's malfunction. \"So what if you fall? Can't you get up by yourself?\" they wrote.\n\nOthers found humor in the mishap.\n\n\"The fall was so real, just like me almost slipping while rushing for my 8 a.m. class,\" one RedNote user wrote.\n\n\"The robot is saying: Can't I take a break when I'm tired of walking?\" another joked.",

    "description": "Silver wiped out most of its meteoric price gains this year that was in part driven by Chinese demand.",
    "fullText": "Silver prices crashed in a harrowing roller-coaster ride that underscored how quickly China's army of speculators can move global commodity markets — and how fast those gains can unravel.\n\nThe white metal has been in the spotlight over the past year after dramatically outperforming gold. Prices surged about 170% in 2025 and climbed more than 60% again in early 2026, vaulting silver to $121 per troy ounce at its peak before the rally spectacularly broke down.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $77.10 per troy ounce at 3:06 a.m. ET on Monday, having erased a large portion of its historic gains in just a few sessions.\n\nOn Friday, silver prices cratered as much as 36% as investors rushed to lock in profits following the meteoric rally and adjust positions.\n\nThe sell-off came on the back of President Donald Trump announcing Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair. The move rattled markets and sparked a sharp reassessment of interest-rate expectations.\n\nEven before the meltdown, warning signs were flashing in China, where speculative trading had reached frenetic levels, leaving prices vulnerable to a rapid unwind.\n\n\"Before the correction, warning signs emerged on Tuesday as Chinese investors faced difficulties withdrawing funds from leveraged gold-trading accounts, and several Chinese funds halted subscriptions to manage overheating sentiment,\" wrote Fabien Yip, a market analyst at IG, on Monday.\n\nIn response to the volatility, major trading venues, including CME Group and the Shanghai Gold Exchange, raised margin requirements. Higher margins require traders to post more cash to hold positions. The move is aimed at cooling speculation but it often forces leveraged investors to sell — adding further downward pressure to prices.\n\n\"Price action was magnified by margin calls on leveraged positions, which further intensified selling pressure amongst other traders,\" Yip said.\n\nSilver's violent price reversal followed recent analyst warnings that silver's rally was running far ahead of underlying fundamentals.\n\nOle Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote last week that the surge was driven largely by retail demand for coins and bars, alongside \"strong and persistent demand\" from China that pushed silver prices in Shanghai to a widening premium over London benchmarks.\n\nWhen that speculative demand faltered, the impact rippled across the broader metals complex. The pullback rippled into other metals, including copper and platinum.\n\nGold, which had also enjoyed a powerful rally, wasn't spared. Spot gold was trading around $4,612 per ounce, after hitting a fresh record above $5,500 per ounce just last week.\n\nMarkets are now closely watching trading activity in China for further clues, particularly with risks building ahead of the long Chinese New Year holidays, when markets will be closed.\n\nThin liquidity during the break could amplify volatility once trading resumes — a prospect that has investors bracing for more sharp moves in the days ahead.",

    "title": "How the decline of economic data could end up with a lot of unemployed Americans",
    "description": "The quality and availability of economic data is declining. That could end up with a lot of unemployed Americans and increase the chance of recession.",
    "fullText": "One of the most underrated revolutions of the past 50 years is the explosion of easily accessible data. Whether it's detailed breakdowns of the characteristics of every neighborhood in the US, improved weather forecasting models that give us extra days to prepare for hurricanes, or personalized genomic analyses that can give us early warnings about disease, there has never been more information more readily available than in the last few decades.\n\nFor businesses and consumers alike, this data surge has been a massive boon to the collective bottom line. A deeper understanding of our world has led to more stable markets and saved lives through disaster planning or improved medicine. But the last year has shown that this data revolution is at risk, especially for the government-produced statistics that have become the backbone for myriad industries and private providers. As this core of information erodes, there is a real risk that we may be sliding into a less measured era.\n\nA future without data is a future in which major actors in our economic system are flying blind. Decision-makers from the Federal Reserve and major Wall Street banks to small businesses and average American households may have to replace good information with vibes and guesses, opening the door to catastrophic mistakes.\n\nPerhaps the best way to understand the threat that data degredation poses is to focus on the global gold standard for information collection: the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While other federal agencies like the Census Bureau also do valuable work, the BLS has, for over a century, been one of the most granular sources of data on the US jobs market, prices, and much more. And the data has only gotten better over the decades: If you want to know how the price of groceries in Boston has changed over the last decade, how many florists are employed across the country, or how many hours Americans spend hanging out with their friends, the BLS is your destination.\n\nOver the past few years, however, the BLS has faced tough times. A stagnant budget, a decline in the number of regular Americans and businesses responding to crucial surveys, and a need to modernize data-gathering techniques all complicated the process of compiling economic statistics. The increasing strain on the agency led the American Statistical Association to conclude in a December 2025 report that \"the nation risks losing the statistical data infrastructure that enables sound policy, economic growth, and efficient and smooth governance.\"\n\nFor people who rely on the BLS, the past year has raised acute concerns. The first was President Donald Trump's firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in July. Revisions to that month's jobs report showed that the US had created far fewer jobs than initially reported in the previous two months. Revisions are a standard part of the BLS data collection process, and the size of the adjustments was well within historical norms. Economists warned that the firing could be a harbinger of political meddling in the crucial job and price figures. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Petersen Institute for International Economics, called the firing a \"five-alarm intentional harm to the integrity of US economic data and the entire statistical system.\" Skanda Amarnath, Executive Director of Employ America, a think tank, said, \"public trust is permanently harmed when the BLS commissioner is fired after one bad jobs report.\"\n\nA few months after McEntarfer's firing, the BLS was rocked by another unprecedented event. The 43-day government shutdown that spanned October and November was not only the longest closure in federal history, it also led to another unprecedented event: Crucial surveys on employment and inflation were not conducted for the first time in nearly 80 years. The modern unemployment rate, which dates back to 1948, had its first gap in its storied history. The consumer price index, one of our main measures of inflation, went unpublished for the first time since its modern form was devised in 1947.\n\nThe private sector stepped in to try to partially fill in the gaps, with releases like ADP's Employment Report offering some visibility, but the dry spell only underlined the inadequacy of these sources. Many of these providers simply don't have the reach and resources that federal data gatherers have built over the years. This expertise and access allow federal agencies to \"reflect the full population or economy,\" PIIE's Kolko wrote in an article released prior to the shutdown.\n\n\"In contrast, companies only see their users or customers,\" he said. \"Credit card data miss the unbanked. Job sites do not capture those who have stopped looking for work. Cellphone data miss people without phones.\" And many private surveys, as Kolko added, rely on federal statistics as a benchmark, \"making private data only as good as the public data they rely on.\"\n\nOn January 30, Trump announced that he would nominate Brett Matsumoto, a former BLS economist and member of the Council of Economic Advisors, to take over as BLS commissioner. The move was widely heralded by economists of all stripes, as the appointment of a dedicated data-driven expert at the troubled agency could be a sign that its woes are being taken seriously. That doesn't alleviate the fact that Matsumoto has a hard road ahead.\n\nThe ruptures of the past year only underscored the BLS's growing concerns. The Bureau's head count fell by 13% between 2024 and early 2026, according to the Office of Personnel Management, underscoring the agency's resource decline. Some programs have faced issues as well — last year, BLS announced it had to suspend data collection for the consumer price index in a handful of cities dotting the country from Buffalo, NY, to Provo, UT. While the Bureau tested the impact of that cut and found it wouldn't mess up inflation figures too much, losing the kinds of second- and third-tier cities where prices can differ significantly from those in the mega-metropolises is an ominous sign for getting the most precise information possible. After the cuts were announced, Russell Weaver, research director at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said in an interview that less accurate CPI data could \"affect people's bottom line and ability to survive who are dependent on wage increases or Social Security benefit increases that are generally tied to cost-of-living changes.\"\n\nThe possibility of a less-informed future extends beyond the troubles at BLS. Other agencies are facing a data dilemma. Last June, the Commerce Department disbanded 14 advisory committees, including three at the Census Bureau. Those panels helped keep the Bureau's data-gathering techniques up to date and were key to planning the 2030 decennial census. Several government databases on climate change have been removed or suspended under the Trump administration, which could make it harder for farmers and real estate developers to access crucial information, such as changes in weather patterns or water reserve levels in Western states.\n\nThe American Statistical Association report included a list of dozens of data sets from BLS and other federal agencies that have been discontinued or curtailed in the last two years: cuts to some underlying tables that the Bureau of Economic Analysis uses in calculating GDP, the BLS has stopped tracking what businesses pay for more than 350 products that were once included in the Producer Price Index, changes to the Census Bureau's annual Survey of Income and Program Participation that tracks US households' economic well-being, and an end to the USDA's annual food insecurity survey, which tracks how many Americans are going hungry. Losing any one of these may not be the end of the world (except to some very particular researchers), but the drip of deleted datasets is increasing, and it risks cascading into a river of missing information, imperiling the more high-profile releases that draw headlines and help shape how America thinks about its economy.\n\nOutside federal agencies, there have been other moves that suggest a paucity of data may be in our future. Trump floated changing Securities and Exchange Commission rules to require public companies to submit their financial information twice a year rather than quarterly. While that could make life a little easier for companies and could, in theory, promote longer-term thinking in C-suites, it also would leave investors with less timely information to decide how to allocate capital and disrupt the white-collar job market.\n\nThe degradation of our data isn't just an egghead concern for economists and scientists. Businesses need this data to plan when and where to hire and expand. Consumers need it to make big purchase decisions and plan their careers. The government needs it to allocate resources.\n\nThe most powerful economic body in the world, the Federal Reserve, relies on BLS data to balance its two major goals: low unemployment and stable prices. The Fed's job is already tricky these days., Mmoving interest rates to perfectly calibrate the economy requires precision — leave rates too high for too long and the number of Americans without a job could spike, but lower them too fast and prices could shoot back up. The data gap during the government shutdown likely contributed to the Fed's increased uncertainty and division at its October meeting. Addressing the missing data, Chairman Jerome Powell described the situation using a meteorological analogy: \"What do you do when driving through the fog? You slow down.\"\n\nEven as the Fed walks more carefully, the reality of the economy doesn't slow down with them. A future with less reliable data could mean a less confident and less competent Fed. If a crisis like the 2008 housing market meltdown or the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic strikes, the central bank and Congress need to know exactly how it's affecting the economy as quickly as possible. If unemployment figures aren't reliable, the Fed and congressional responses could be too muted, leading to a longer and deeper recession, or too aggressive, spiking inflation and making everyone worse off.\n\nIf the Fed, with its massive staff of economists, struggled to make decisions without the regular flow of government statistics, then it stands to reason that businesses, which also have to deal with day-to-day operations, will struggle as well. A March 2025 survey of economic and business gurus by the Chicago Booth School of Business found that 90% of respondents agreed that the \"ability of businesses to forecast and plan will be substantially impaired by lower quality economic data.\"\n\nSpeaking on a more personal level, as Business Insider's economic data editor, my job is to see what's going on in the economy and work with a talented team of reporters to help you, the reader, understand what it means for your life. The economic data from the BLS and other agencies is the first step in seeing those trends, and losing it would make it much harder to do that job. And it's not just my job; think of all the data you use to make decisions about your own career: Does the economy seem like it's in a good place to quit your job? What kind of wages could you expect from a career shift? Are there a lot of job openings in your field, or has hiring frozen?\n\nThis slow erosion of the information that informs our decisions also creates a vicious trust feedback loop. Americans are increasingly relying on \"vibes\" to understand the economy, creating a disconnect between how people think and feel about their economic prospects and the underlying reality. This break between lived experience and aggregate measures has eroded trust in the data itself. An August 2025 Economist/YouGov poll found that 45% of respondents completely or somewhat distrust federal economic data, compared with 42% who somewhat or completely trust it. Only 21% of people in the same survey said that the government's count of unemployment was accurate. If economic data becomes less reliable, it will continue to warp people's ideas of the economy and make decision-making harder.\n\nIt is fair to say that the amount of data being collected on our world can be overwhelming. There's more high-quality data than ever before, but there's also more garbage, poorly run surveys, and questionable analysis. It can be hard to make decisions amid that flood, but the answer to our struggles in understanding data is not to generate less data. That only allows bad-faith actors to seize on collective ignorance. The inability to understand the world would make it even harder for a well-run capitalist economy to function.\n\nAndy Kiersz is an economic data editor at Business Insider.",

    "description": "Replit product engineer Rachael Fuller said she signed her contract one week before learning she was pregnant. Here's how she managed her time.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rachael Fuller, a 31-year-old product engineer at Replit, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm married to my high school sweetheart. We met in standardized testing when we were 12.\n\nWe got married during the pandemic, and our wedding got postponed. By the time we finally had it, I was pregnant with our first. We have two daughters: one who's about to turn 3, and our latest addition, who's 2 and a half months.\n\nI found out I was pregnant with my first when I was winding down my first company. I honestly was like, \"I should just get a job in Big Tech, get the cushy maternity benefits.\" That would be the rational thing to do.\n\nBut I never felt that excited about being a small cog in a very large machine. I decided to take the leap and work on this new startup while also having my first baby, which I don't know that I would recommend.\n\nIt was a journey. We moved back to our home in Massachusetts to be near our family at this time, to have that extra support. I was building these two really big projects: a life inside me, and also a company.\n\nDisclaimer: I have pretty easy pregnancies. I don't get nausea, I sleep pretty well. My husband is also a stay-at-home dad, so that simplifies our life immensely. If it weren't for his sacrifices and picking up the slack, I wouldn't have survived, let alone launch anything. I'm really grateful that he's made that sacrifice.\n\nStill, something's gotta give. I was really into cooking or hosting dinner parties, and that's what I chose to sacrifice.\n\nYou need to be really careful about where you choose to work. Even putting aside the crazy 996 culture, there are a lot of tech companies that are led by people who don't have kids, who don't understand what it takes to raise a family.\n\nI started at Beacons, a small company founded by four single men who are wonderful and wanted to be supportive of me as a mom. I was pumping, and we had to work out where I would do that in this tiny, three-room office. We figured it out.\n\nI joined Replit in April. I signed my offer letter, and then found out the next week that I was pregnant with my second.\n\nA big reason I joined Replit is that there are a lot of families there. When I was doing my last interview with Replit's cofounders, Amjad and Haya, they had their daughter sitting on their lap, chatting with me.\n\nThere have been a few times when I'll come into the office and people's kids will be in for the day. It's not a problem. It's actually kind of cool: my coworker's kid is showing me the app they're building on Replit.\n\nWhen you have that many parents, the company is able to be pro-family in a way that's natural and not forced. It felt like a very supportive environment for me.\n\nI knew this job was going to be a lot more demanding because of where Replit was in its growth curve. I wanted to experience this feeling of hypergrowth.\n\nI worked on an initiative to connect Replit's agent with third-party applications. It's called Connectors. We actually ended up acquiring a company, OpenInt, to make it happen, and I shepherded that acquisition.\n\nWe had to ship it before I gave birth. In tech, you don't often have really hard deadlines like that.\n\nIt was intense. In the weeks leading up to the big launches, we have sprint weeks where we're all together in-person, coding for 12 hours a day. I worked at the office till midnight, Ubered home, and worked a little bit before I went to sleep.\n\nI was in my third trimester. It was crazy.\n\nThe day the Connectors feature launched, I went straight from the office to the hospital. I was having contractions. How crazy would that be, to literally launch both on the same day?\n\nWe shipped the feature at the end of September. Then I had some time to prepare all the hand-off materials. I was supposed to take a week off and go on maternity leave a week before my due date, but my daughter came a week early.\n\nI literally shipped my last feature on Friday, went to the hospital on Saturday, and had a baby.\n\nSprint week is not life at Replit. That 5-8 p.m. period is family time. That's something that I will hold sacred until the day I die. I'm going to have dinner with my kids, and then maybe log back in and finish things up if I need to.\n\nMore immature companies in tech tend to think that parents are too distracted. There are a lot of benefits to hiring parents. They bring a kind of time management that you don't develop until you have kids.",

    "description": "Sam Wright has done around 500 free job support calls from job seekers since last year. Here's his best advice for landing a job in 2026.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Wright, a 31-year-old head of growth at Huntr, based in Seattle. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI start my day with at least two, sometimes up to 10, free 15-minute one-on-one job search support sessions.\n\nI get on these calls with people coming from layoffs at big companies like Amazon and Google, and they've never struggled in the job market before. They don't know what to do.\n\nJob seeking is one of the most vulnerable moments in someone's life, so I started offering these free support sessions last July as an extra way to support those struggling in this job market, and I've now done around 500 calls.\n\nI work at Huntr, an AI-powered résumé builder and job search tracker. Most of our clients are from the tech world: software developers and engineers, UI and UX designers, and product and project managers. We use anonymized data collected from our job search tracker and résumé builder to track the job market and train and develop our AI tools. We've analyzed over 1.2 million applications across over 225,000 résumés.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, there's this pent-up energy and renewed optimism in the job market following the end-of-year slowdown. Here are five pieces of advice I tell every job seeker to put their best foot forward.\n\nDuring the early days of COVID, especially in the tech sector, it was a job seeker market. An entry-level software engineer was basically getting handed a job once they finished school. Now, that's not the case.\n\nMany job seekers have applied to hundreds of jobs and still don't hear back. In an employer-favored market, your North Star should be the application-to-interview conversion rate.\n\nMake sure you're metrics-driven in your search approach, because it's ultimately a sales process. You're selling your services and skills, and how often your applications result in job interviews is a measurable way to see how well you're doing this.\n\nApply to one target job title at a time. You can pivot as needed, but our best practice is to apply to 10 to 15 jobs with a well-tailored résumé that matches the job description, and to do so for the next two to three weeks.\n\nIf you aren't getting an interview within 20 applications, and definitely within 50, you need to think about getting feedback on the résumé and taking a second look at where and what you're applying for.\n\nDifferent job boards also have different application-to-interview conversion rates, so try applying to different jobs using different websites such as LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and more to help increase your conversion rate.\n\nEverybody who posts a job online wants it to be searchable on Google.\n\nDoing a Boolean search on Google should be a routine part of your job search process. Boolean searches are basically just sophisticated searches, with a few different parameters that let you combine keywords and narrow your search.\n\nSimply doing a Google search for jobs aggregates all of the jobs across all of the job boards and can be the best way to start your search. If you search for something like \"Data Analyst Jobs\" on Google, it will realize the intent is to look for a job posting and show you postings under the dedicated jobs tab at the top of the search.\n\nThe jobs are sourced from all over the web because sites want their job postings to be indexed and searchable by Google for SEO purposes.\n\nThe page length of your résumé is one of the biggest things that people struggle with. I've seen that across the board, entry-level, mid-range, and senior-level, it doesn't matter. We see a slight increase in responses with two-page résumés.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's not about the length of the résumé; it's the quality of the content as it matches the job description to which you're applying.\n\nFor example, having a bit more about you in your education section has ultimately been helpful. Awards, accomplishments, and key achievements from school are also helpful, as long as they're relevant to the job description.\n\nYour achievements section of your résumé should look something like, \"I did X, which had Y result and Z impact.\" A lot of people miss the last part, or the 'why it matters,' which is connecting the ultimate impact your achievement had.\n\nRemember that even a hospital janitor is helping save lives in some way. That's an extreme example, but it's all about the framing and how you see yourself in the greater picture.\n\nDo you have a story or advice to share about landing a job in the current job market?

    "description": "Scott Borchetta discusses his daily schedule, balancing meetings, artist management, daily exercise, and watching Netflix with his wife.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Borchetta, the 63-year-old CEO and chairman of Big Machine Label Group, based in Nashville. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started my career in the mailroom for my dad's promotion company and worked my way up after we moved from California to Nashville. I played bass in a country band at night, where I learned about the music industry. I used that knowledge to pursue jobs at record labels.\n\nMy first job in the industry was at MTM Records. I then spent two years working as an independent promoter before moving into promotion and artist development roles at MCA Nashville Records, DreamWorks Nashville, and Universal Music Nashville.\n\nIn 2005, I left Universal Music Nashville to start Big Machine Records. The record label I founded has grown over 20 years into the Big Machine Label Group.\n\nBMLG artists have included Taylor Swift, Rascal Flatts, Reba McEntire, Florida Georgia Line, Thomas Rhett, Brantley Gilbert, Ronnie Dunn, Sugarland, and Carly Pearce, among others.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nThe first thing I do when I wake up is work out for 90 minutes. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the workout takes place at my house with a trainer. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it's held at a physical therapy center.\n\nAfter my workout, I become a fireman by checking my phone and seeing what's happening in the business, because there's always something burning. I respond to urgent messages so that I can focus on the day's mission. When you have 35-plus artists, there's always a meeting, new music to be made, and the next TV show to schedule.\n\nI eat light in the morning; I like to let the workout burn. I'm more of a green tea person, as that doesn't have too much caffeine.\n\nI'm in the office every business day; I'm still old school about that. I appreciate the energy of people interacting, and face-to-face interactions still yield the best results and understanding of the mission.\n\nOn Monday, I have a publicity meeting, followed by an A&R meeting. In the afternoon, we have our three different country imprint promotion calls, because Monday is our ad day, so we find out which stations added which records.\n\nTuesday's our leadership day. Wednesday and Thursday have standing meetings. I leave Friday open. Anyone who wants to schedule with me has to go through my executive assistant.\n\nEven for business lunches, it's easier to have people come and bring food. That way, we won't waste 30 to 40 minutes going back and forth.\n\nI usually have a kale salad with salmon, or a sliced filet — definitely a protein-rich midday option. I'm not a huge eater, but those are my go-to options, and I eat sushi once a week.\n\nThe indulgence I allow myself most days is one eight-ounce can of Red Bull for a surge in the afternoon.\n\nI recently met with Mackenzie Carpenter about the new album she's preparing to record. The next day, I might have a Thomas Rhett strategy meeting.\n\nI have time in the afternoon to catch up on things and ensure we're moving forward. Every day is different. I try to leave a couple of hours in the afternoon to do the actual work, rather than nonstop back-to-back meetings.\n\nThe time I leave depends on what we have going on. The artists we have playing will dictate when I leave the office. The other night, I went to see Jackson Dean at the Opry at 9 p.m.\n\nIf I have an open night, it's a great opportunity for me to catch up and spend some quality time with my wife. My wife is a very good cook. Occasionally, we'll order out, so I always say, \"Oh, I cooked. Look, honey.\"\n\nMy wife and I enjoy binge-watching shows together at night. Friday night is party night; we'll have red wine, usually a Bordeaux or Cali Cab, and there's always chocolate hidden in a cupboard.\n\nOne of my favorite series from the last year or so was The Offering, which is a series on the making of The Godfather. We've just finished Acapulco.\n\nAfter watching a show with my wife, I'll typically go to bed late, wake up, and do it all over again.\n\nAn example of a week of travel is being in Vegas from Wednesday through Sunday morning. Wednesday night, we saw Mötley Crüe. On Thursday night, we attended a crazy show called Absinthe, a Cirque du Soleil production.\n\nFriday night featured Sammy Hagar, who was part of the iHeart Festival, and Saturday night was Tim McGraw, also part of the iHeart Festival. Many of the iHeart crew are dear friends and great business partners, so it's often very late nights.\n\nI work on the weekends if something needs to be done.\n\nFor my artists, especially, I always make time for them if they need anything. It doesn't derail my day when we have to rearrange some things. Even if something goes really wrong, I'm very good at compartmentalizing.\n\nJust because something went wrong with this artist or manager doesn't mean the next executive or the next artist will inherit that overflow — I try to put the right energy where it belongs.\n\nWhen I spend a lot of time having in-person conversations during the day and come back to see that I have 168 emails, I'm like, Ugh. Email is so ineffective in many ways, but it's a necessary evil. If I could do away with it, I would much rather be in person.\n\nA lot of these artists are my friends, and they walk in, and people are like, \"Oh my God, did you see that so-and-so was in the office today?\" I'm always listening to new music from our artists and potential new signings. Non Big Machine artists on the playlist jump from Yungblud to Ella Langley to Sombr.\n\nWhether it was Taylor Swift back in the day, or Reba McIntyre, or Dolly Parton, or Riley Green right now — I love working with artists who think big.\n\nI'm proud of our NASCAR team, Big Machine Racing, and I'm proud of Borchetta Bourbon, which is off to its best year ever. There are many fun things across all our brands, and I love what I do.",

    "description": "Igor Tsvetkov says he faced a \"lot of stress\" as a senior staff engineer at Meta. But securing a demotion isn't easy, he said. Now, he's at Google.",
    "fullText": "There are dozens and dozens of guides on how to ask for a promotion. What about a demotion?\n\nIgor Tsvetkov spent over a year as a senior staff software engineer at Meta, coming from a background at Google and Cruise. Then he posted on LinkedIn, describing how difficult he found it to try to blend into Meta's culture — and why he decided to ask for a downward shift in title.\n\n\"I did not fit in perfectly,\" Tsvetkov wrote in the December post, describing the need for intimate systems knowledge and credibility among leaders at his rank. \"It is very hard to achieve all of that when you join as a new hire from another company and work from a remote office.\"\n\nHis slow ramp-up caused a \"lot of stress,\" he wrote, and he eventually wished for a demotion — before jumping back to Google.\n\nOn \"The Peterman Pod,\" Tsvetkov recently described his Meta story in more detail. During performance reviews, Tsvetkov said he knew he was being judged against other senior staff engineers. He also knew that Meta laid off low performers.\n\n\"What it means is: you have at most one year to ramp up to be comparable in performance to other old-timers at the company,\" Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov needed to \"start from zero,\" he said. On day one, he said he knew less than the intern sitting next to him. Within the year and two months that he spent at Meta, Tsvetkov guessed that he had reached the performance of an E6 software engineer — if he was \"generous\" — but not the E7 he was hired to be.\n\nHe also learned he didn't want to be an E7. Coding and debugging were what Tsvetkov loved about his job, he said, but those skills are rarely practiced at that high a level.\n\nWhile Tsvetkov's experience is not necessarily representative of what other Meta engineers experience, it captures how difficult it can be to make career moves at the senior level, across tech and beyond. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTsvetkov eventually said he asked management: \"Can I actually drop a level?\"\n\nThat's difficult for Meta, he recognized. His stock grants and compensation were already determined. There is a demotion process at Meta — like when a director wants to become an individual contributor — but dropping a single level on the same team was more challenging, Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov said he was told no. Maybe if he pushed harder, or went to a vice president, the answer would have been different, he said.\n\n\"I also felt like I was too far outside my comfort zone,\" he added. \"I worked at Google for 14 and a half years. That was my comfort zone.\"\n\nA Google recruiter had been contacting Tsvetkov periodically, asking whether he was ready to return. He finally said yes.",

    "description": "A handful of billionaires and prominent companies urged corporations to leave Delaware. According to the numbers, the opposite happened.",
    "fullText": "A handful of billionaires and prominent companies have tried to cement a new, less-than-ideal narrative about Delaware: The glory days are over.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Elon Musk, who previously had two companies incorporated in the state, wrote on X in 2024.\n\nHowever, dozens of X posts and interviews disparaging the state over its handling of certain legal cases haven't moved the needle. In fact, the opposite has happened: The number of companies incorporated in Delaware has increased.\n\n\"Amid fears of decline, 2025 was a period of monumental growth for Delaware,\" Andrew Verstein, the author of the Corporate Census, wrote in a recent report.\n\nThe Corporate Census is a database of nearly all entity formations in the United States, including traditional corporate registrations and alternative options such as LLCs.\n\nVerstein has spent almost two years collecting data on corporations and published an update to his research earlier this month.\n\nAlthough Delaware has a reputation as a business-friendly state, it faced a storm of bad press in 2024 and 2025 when some companies began to ditch the state for what they considered greener legal pastures. Musk, most prominently, removed Tesla and SpaceX's corporate registrations from Delaware after a judge voided his multibillion-dollar Tesla pay package.\n\nHe and some other prominent CEOs have criticized Delaware's courts over what they consider subjective rulings. Delaware's Supreme Court reinstated Musk's pay package in December, but not before some of Musk's peers joined his unofficial campaign.\n\nCompanies like the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and the leading crypto-exchange Coinbase followed suit, also citing uncertainty around Delaware's legal system as a factor in their departures, going so far as to urge others to do the same. The alleged exodus has been dubbed \"Dexit,\" a play on the words \"Delaware\" and \"exit.\"\n\nDespite the departures, Delaware is doing just fine.\n\n\"The short answer is that 'Dexit' isn't happening,\" Verstein told Business Insider.\n\nIn his report, Verstein wrote that Delaware's share of corporate formations increased sharply at the beginning of 2025. Delaware experienced an \"absolute increase,\" he wrote, meaning the growth was driven by new formations in Delaware rather than a decline in formations in other states.\n\n\"Instead, there is a clear increase in Delaware's relative popularity beginning in 2025, making it a singular leader in a period otherwise lacking corporate growth,\" Verstein wrote in the report. \"About 30% more Delaware corporations formed in 2025 than in 2024, greatly exceeding the prior trendline. This, while national incorporation levels remained flat.\"\n\nAt the moment, Verstein said the official cause of the formation boost isn't clear, but speculated on two theories. For one, Delaware implemented new laws to address some of the complaints from Musk and others. They strengthened corporate management's authority and altered shareholder rights.\n\n\"These laws were intended to restore confidence in Delaware law after several 2024 judicial opinions arguably upset market expectations. Yet the jump in incorporations begins prior to the late February 2025 announcement of SB 21. And it begins substantially after the March 2024 passage of SB 313,\" Verstein wrote. \"While it is certainly possible that the increase reflects a lagged response to SB 313, or perhaps a preemptive response to the legislative currents that led to SB 21, the timing does not immediately commend itself to that explanation.\"\n\nHe also pointed toward external factors outside Delaware's control.\n\n\"For example, President Donald J. Trump won the general election on November 5, 2024 and took office on January 20, 2025,\" he wrote. \"Perhaps Delaware corporations were expected to be especially useful under his administration.\"\n\nVerstein said, despite the cause being unclear, \"the data are plainly incompatible with the most alarmist theories of Dexit.\"\n\nFor its part, Delaware's government is unfazed.\n\n\"Delaware continues to lead the world as the preeminent home for business,\" a spokesperson for Delaware's Secretary of State, which oversees corporations, said in a statement. \"The data speaks for itself — Delaware's corporate franchise remains strong thanks in large part to the unmatched expertise and efficiency of the Delaware Division of Corporations.\"\n\nDuring a 2024 interview with Business Insider, Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez brushed off concerns that they were struggling due to \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way,\" Patibanda-Sanchez said. \"We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "title": "How AI is changing the storied McKinsey interview",
    "description": "From McKinsey & Company to Boston Consulting Group, AI has now become a factor in the case interview.",
    "fullText": "Entire books have been written to teach people how to beat a McKinsey interview. Now, the game is changing.\n\nFor decades, consulting firms like McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, and Bain & Company have relied on case interviews, during which prospective candidates work through simulated client problems with higher-ups at the firm.\n\nNow, as consulting firms race to both adopt AI and advise their clients on how to do the same — implementing the technology into everything from drafting reports to synthesizing data — the technology has become a new hurdle in the vaunted interview process at McKinsey, BCG, and others.\n\nThe changes come as these firms shift the type of work they do, focusing less on straight advisory projects and more on building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies. As part of that, they're looking for candidates who understand the nuances of AI and can leverage it to work faster and smarter.\n\nEarlier this month, several media outlets reported that McKinsey had begun piloting Lilli, its internal chatbot, in interviews. The firm declined to comment further on the use of Lilli.\n\nLilli is used within the firm to synthesize its proprietary research, which spans 100 years and over 100,000 documents and interviews.\n\nMcKinsey Senior Partner Delphine Zurkiya told Business Insider that over 70% of the firm's 45,000 employees now use the tool, and that those who use it do so about 17 times a week. Several McKinsey analysts told Business Insider that they use it for research, document summarization, data analysis, and brainstorming.\n\nStephen Turban, a former McKinsey analyst who has worked with hundreds of students applying for roles at McKinsey, BCG, and Bain through his company, Wall Street Guide, said that he's noticed Lilli come up in the later rounds of the case interview — often to the surprise of candidates.\n\n\"The biggest reaction is a little bit of a lack of preparation,\" said Turban, who is also the cofounder of Lumiere Education, a platform that connects students with Ph.D. mentors to produce independent research.\n\nEven as a mentor, there's not much that he can do to help students, he said.\n\n\"It seems like the AI is created to give information that's not 100% correct or vague,\" he said. So, it's a test of how well students can solve problems with a certain level of ambiguity.\n\nAre you a consultant? Tell us how you're using AI below.\n\nBoston Consulting Group also has an automated portion of the interview run by its chatbot, Casey. Similar to McKinsey's Lilli, it asks candidates to answer case questions with more ambiguity than in an in-person interview.\n\nAmmon Jensen, an MBA candidate at Brigham Young University who just accepted a summer internship offer at BCG, told Business Insider that one of his opening questions was a market-sizing exercise around a DoorDash competitor. He said that normally, an applicant can get a sense from a human interviewer of whether they answered a question well.\n\n\"It's really hard to get an interview, but once you've got an interview, they really want you to succeed,\" he said. Casey, however, is more neutral, he said.\n\nThere's a limit, however, to how much consulting firms want their applicants to be using AI.\n\nDuring a networking call with a BCG recruiter, Jensen learned that the firm, at least in the Dallas office, had stopped reviewing cover letters because they are now so easy to write with ChatGPT and other AI tools.\n\nAnd some applicants have been rejected for using technology in their interviews in unapproved ways.\n\n\"Some people have already gotten in trouble using AI during case interviews,\" Marc Cosentino, the author of Case in Point, the definitive how-to for acing consulting interviews, told Business Insider.\n\nThere have been instances where students have begun using AI in Zoom interviews to help them solve cases, he said. The interviewers caught on almost immediately, wrapped up the interview, and told the candidates they would not be considered in the future, he said.\n\n\"Word gets around,\" he added. \"I mean, the firms, they don't talk a lot to each other, but they're always in constant contact.\"\n\nSomething to share about how consultants are using AI?

    "description": "The CEO of a payments startup says linking AI adoption to profit sharing helped cut costs and boost morale.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ran Grushkowsky, who co-founded the Las Vegas-based payments company MassPay in 2000, then served on its board, and was named CEO in December. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nUntil mid-2025, it was a challenge to get employees at MassPay to use AI. They were maybe afraid that it would replace their jobs. There was a misalignment around how AI could produce cost savings.\n\nTo solve this problem, we created a profit-sharing program, and it's working well for us. We announced it a year ago and told employees we have two goals. One is to make more money, which is obvious. The more important one is to cut costs.\n\nThe idea was that the more efficiently they work, the bigger the pool of money they'd get to share. It was a little bit of a shock at first. People are used to getting bonuses or stock options, so profit-sharing took a little bit of explaining. But once it clicked, we started to see results.\n\nThe way it works is that the company first sets aside the money it needs to maintain operations and grow. Any profit beyond that threshold goes into the profit-sharing pool.\n\nEach eligible employee's share is calculated by dividing their salary by the total number of eligible salaries, then multiplying by the amount in the profit-sharing pool.\n\nSay an employee makes $100,000 a year, and the eligible employees' salaries total $2 million, and the profit-sharing pool is $300,000. The employee would receive 15% of their salary, or $15,000.\n\nLast year, participants received 18% of their annual salary from the program. This year, we expect they'll receive close to 50%.\n\nBefore we started doing this, we planned to hire about five people in 2025, but that need has been eliminated thanks to AI. We were able to help our employees find their own superpowers so they could do more than they did before.\n\nFor example, when a business is submitting an application to become a client, it used to take a week to process all the information — documents such as letters of incorporation, compliance manuals, and user agreements. Now we can do it within 24 hours.\n\nAI isn't replacing existing employees, and because of our incentive program, I think morale has increased. Initially, it was a concern, but everybody wants to be part of a winning team. AI tools can help you improve everything you do as a team.",

    "description": "Hedge fund allocators can't get enough of quant and macro trading. Quants accounted for more than 70% of the industry's net inflows last year.",
    "fullText": "Hedge funds are \n\nFor the second year in a row, hedge funds — the group of firms including Citadel, Millennium, D.E. Shaw, and Bridgewater — are the most sought-after asset class, according to Goldman Sachs' prime services industry outlook report. The group's lead over private equity, private credit, venture capital, and other alternatives reached an all-time high, according to the bank's data.\n\n\"Almost half of allocators plan to increase their allocation to hedge funds in 2026, compared to just 4% who plan to trim their allocation,\" Goldman said in the report.\n\nBut demand isn't evenly spread across strategies. Some hedge fund approaches are far more coveted than others heading into 2026.\n\nQuantitative trading strategies — which rely on computer models and algorithms rather than human judgment — are the most in-demand strategy, according to Goldman's survey of more than 300 hedge fund allocators. On net, 23% of allocators said they plan to increase exposure to quant funds.\n\nDiscretionary macro strategies ranked close behind, with 21% of allocators planning to add exposure. Those funds make human-driven bets on global economic trends across markets like interest rates, currencies, and commodities.\n\nBoth strategies delivered solid performance in 2025 and offer diversification from equity-heavy portfolios, particularly after another strong year for stock markets. The rising demand suggests \"allocators remain focused on adding uncorrelated exposure to their hedge fund portfolios,\" Goldman said.\n\nDespite bouts of market turbulence in July and October, quantitative funds gained 10.5% in aggregate last year. Firms including Qube Research, D.E. Shaw, and AQR posted standout results.\n\nOver the past five years, quant strategies have been the best-performing hedge fund category, according to Goldman's data, and they have dominated fundraising. Quant funds accounted for more than 70% of the industry's $78 billion in net inflows in 2025 — their second consecutive year leading by a wide margin.\n\nDiscretionary macro strategies typically thrive during periods of economic and geopolitical volatility. Tariff tensions, shifting interest-rate expectations, and geopolitical flare-ups helped drive returns in 2025, and many investors see similar conditions ahead in 2026.\n\nMacro funds gained 11.5% overall last year, with firms like Bridgewater, Element, and Rokos posting returns above 20%. Demand could remain strong as President Donald Trump continues to publicly pressure the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\nNot all macro strategies have fared as well. Systematic macro funds and commodity trading advisors — automated strategies that trade global futures markets — struggled in 2025 and over the past five years, with gains of just 0.5% and 5.3%, respectively.\n\nUnsurprisingly, they are the least popular strategies among allocators heading into 2026.",

    "description": "The erosion of economic data over the past year poses a massive risk for individuals and businesses",
    "fullText": "They say numbers never lie, but what if we don't have them in the first place?\n\nThe erosion of economic data over the past year poses a massive risk for individuals and businesses, writes BI's Andy Kiersz. (As our economic data editor, he would know!)\n\nYou might scoff at the idea that there isn't enough data. Sometimes it can feel like we have too much information on just about everything.\n\nThe crux of the issue is government-issued data, specifically from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS is the backbone of our economic data infrastructure, offering hyper-specific information on everything from jobs to prices. Not only is it valuable in its own right, it's also leveraged by private-data providers to build out their feeds.\n\nBut budget cuts, leadership changes, and old-school data-gathering techniques mean the data so many people and businesses rely on might not be that reliable for much longer.\n\nThat creates challenges for anyone looking to navigate an economy that's hard enough in the best of circumstances.\n\nNot everyone stands to lose, though.\n\nBack when I was a real reporter and didn't just ride the coattails of my more-talented colleagues via this newsletter, I wrote a lot about alternative data.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, alt data is non-traditional information that's not readily available and often takes some time to sift through. A classic example: Satellite images of a retail chain's parking lots to gauge foot traffic.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Because it shows the outside-the-box ways companies and investors can get economic data. And while it might not be as all-encompassing as what the BLS offers, it's a start.\n\nBut here's the rub. That data isn't available to everyone. In fact, plenty of investors pay more money to make sure they're the only ones that have it.\n\nSo as publicly available data becomes tougher to get, a gap could grow between those who can afford to splurge for alternative options and everyone else.\n\nAs we examine the future of capitalism, a common complaint about the current system is the widening chasm between the haves and the have nots. The loss of widely available economic data threatens to spread that even more.",

    "description": "The \"father of the iPod,\" Tony Fadell, said the market is ripe for a new take on one of Apple's most famous devices.",
    "fullText": "Forget 2016, it's time to make sound like 2001 again.\n\nTony Fadell, creator of the iPod, said it is time for Apple to relaunch the device that changed the Cupertino-based tech giant and music forever.\n\n\"I think there are smarter ways of making an AirPod that has an iPod in it. So, I think they need to bring back the iPod,\" Fadell told Eric Newcomer during a recent interview on the tech journalist's podcast.\n\nFadell, widely known as \"the father of the iPod,\" said there are two reasons to bring back the device that is synonymous with his legacy.\n\nFirst, to cash in on the broader nostalgia around the music device, which ended in 2019 with the release of the revamped, 7th-generation iPod Touch. The original iPod, which could hold just 1,000 songs, shared much \n\n\"So, iPod from the nostalgic point of view for all those people who's like, 'Oh, I remember the iPod,' but they don't want distractions anymore,\" Fadell said.\n\nSecond, a modern iPod would also tap into a market of music listeners who want a more \"pure\" experience, listening to music without all the extra stuff that comes with listening to music on a smartphone. After all, dumb phones are becoming increasingly popular as people try to simplify their relationship with tech.\n\nOnline, there are still active communities that seek to mod the now-retro iPods to fit more modern needs, including an entire subreddit devoted to the cause.\n\nPressed on what form a new iPod would take, Fadell said he wouldn't give away all of his ideas. Fadell has been mentioned in some corners as a potential replacement for CEO Tim Cook, who has been the subject of retirement speculation. (Cook, who is 64, has said he will not retire in a \"traditional\" way.) Apple exec John Ternus, the iPhone company's senior vice president of hardware engineering, is widely reported to be the top contender to replace Cook.\n\n\"Apple will make the right decision when they need to, about who the next CEO is. I love the company. It's been in my blood since 1980, '81, when I had my first Apple II,\" Fadell said. \"If anyone calls from the board, or Tim called, whatever, I'll be happy to pick up the phone and that's it. I'll help 'em any way they think they would like to be helped.\"\n\nFadell pointed to how Sony — which sells a $3,699 collector's edition of a Walkman — recently announced its first new turntables in years, seeking to capitalize on the growing number of vinyl listeners. Sony also sold off control of its TV line to TCL.\n\n\"They kill the TVs, and they bring back turntables,\" Fadell said. \"You tell me.\"",

A humiliation.\n\nAfterwards, boss Sonia Bompastor pledged to keep searching for solutions but conceded she would be \"happy\" to leave if the Chelsea hierarchy felt her time was up.\n\nSo where has it all gone wrong for her side this season?",

Our commitment to inclusion and our support for the LGBTQ+ community remains unchanged.\"\n\nThe club apologised the next day and said the team acknowledged the \"hurt and disappointment\" that came as a result of the decision.\n\nA spokesperson said the Fife Flyers was committed to inclusion and being a welcoming club for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThey added: \"We are truly sorry for the impact this had and understand why it has caused upset amongst the community.\n\n\"We will reflect on this, continue listening, and work to ensure our values are better reflected in how we move forward.\"\n\nThe match kit was due to be auctioned to raise funds for local LGBTQ+ charity The Hive Kirkcaldy.\n\nThe charity said it was \"extremely disappointed\" in the decision, adding that it had not been informed about the decision beforehand.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"In light of this, The Hive have refused to accept any money, strip or donations from the club and left the match immediately.\n\n\"We will be writing to them regarding this. The Hive will always stand up for LGBTQIA+ rights and we will not be silenced.\"\n\nFife Pride said it was \"angry and deeply disappointed\" in the club's decision.\n\nIt said: \"Let us be clear: Pride is not a warm-up. Pride is not optional. And Pride is not something that should be compromised to accommodate 'personal beliefs'.\n\n\"When an organisation chooses to scale back visible LGBTQIA+ inclusion, that is a choice, and it has consequences.\n\n\"Decisions like this undermine trust, damage relationships with the community, and send a harmful message about whose identities are considered negotiable.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn the aftermath of a 95–61 blowout loss to No. 8 Iowa State, that was the sentence Jerome Tang chose to stand on as Kansas State slipped to two games under .500 as February is underway. No hedging. No qualifiers. Just a clear rejection of the framing.\n\nThe scoreboard left little room for interpretation. Iowa State was faster, stronger, and sharper. Tang didn’t argue that. “They’re just better than we are right now,” he said, repeatedly crediting the Cyclones. What he refused to do was let the moment fracture his locker room.\n\n“This is not a message for the fans,” Tang said. “This is a message for my players.”\n\nThat posture carried through the entire press conference. When asked about disappointment, he pushed back. When pressed to expand, he declined. “No, I don’t want to expand on it.” When the conversation drifted toward broader program questions, he deferred. “At the end of the season we’ll talk about that.”\n\nMore: Jerome Tang buyout, contract details as Kansas State Wildcats coach\n\nStill, Tang didn’t hide from accountability. With program legends in attendance, he turned the disappointment inward. “I’m more disappointed in me as a as a coach and the game plan for the first half than I am for the players for their execution,” he said.\n\nThe message remained consistent. Protect the players. Own the rest.\n\nMore: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nAsked whether the group remains bought in, Tang was brief but firm. “They’re still trying. Yes. Yes, they are.”\n\nThere was definitely an edge in the room, but it wasn’t reckless. It was protective. Tang wasn’t denying results or pretending the season has gone to plan. He was drawing a boundary around how his team would be discussed publicly.This is the kind of press conference that gets remembered quietly.\n\nDefiance doesn’t guarantee anything. But at 10–12 this late in the season, it draws a clear picture. Tang isn’t hedging. He’s standing with his guys and betting that belief still matters.\n\nHubert Davis buyout, contract details as UNC Tar Heels coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nPenny Hardaway buyout, contract details as Memphis Tigers coach\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox traded right-handed pitchers Jordan Hicks and David Sandlin to the Chicago White Sox on Monday.\n\nHicks, 29, joins Chicago after recording a 6.95 ERA in 34 games during the 2025 season. He split that time between the San Francisco Giants and the Red Sox, appearing in 21 games for Boston. The Texas native struck out 58 batters more than 67 one/three innings and made nine starts during the year.\n\nThe Red Sox originally acquired Hicks on June 15, 2025, in a trade that sent Rafael Devers to the Giants. Since being drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2015, Hicks has appeared in 275 career Major League games with the Cardinals, Toronto Blue Jays, Giants and Red Sox. He holds a career 4.41 ERA.\n\nSandlin, 24, was also sent to Chicago after pitching for Double-A Portland and Triple-A Worcester in 2025. He posted a 4.50 ERA with 107 strikeouts across 106 innings. Sandlin was considered one of Boston’s top prospects, ranking No. 8 by MLB.com and No. 11 by Baseball America. During the 2025 season, he was twice named the Eastern League Pitcher of the Week.\n\nThe Oklahoma native began his professional career with the Kansas City Royals, who selected him in the 11th round of the 2022 draft. Boston acquired him via trade on Feb. 17, 2024. Throughout his minor league career, Sandlin has a 4.38 ERA and 279 strikeouts in 65 games.\n\nIn exchange, Boston acquired minor league pitcher Gage Ziehl, cash considerations, and a player to be named later.\n\nZiehl, 22, comes to the Boston organization following his first professional season. He posted a 4.12 ERA with 90 strikeouts and 19 walks across three different minor league levels in 2025. He started the season in the New York Yankees system before being traded to the White Sox on July 30. Following that trade, he recorded a 4.01 ERA in six starts for High-A Winston-Salem.\n\nZiehl was a fourth-round pick by the Yankees in 2024 out of the University of Miami. The South Carolina native is currently ranked as a top prospect by both MLB.com (No. 14) and Baseball America (No. 21).\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "Third-Year coaching grades: Where Kenny Dillingham, Deion Sanders and Brent Key rank from A to F originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe end of the 2025 college football season concluded year three for eight power four college football coaches. Kenny Dillingham-Arizona State, Hugh Freeze-Auburn, Scott Satterfield-Cincinnati, Deion Sanders-Colorado, Brent Key-Georgia Tech, Jeff Brohm-Louisville, Matt Rhule-Nebraska and Luke Fickell-Wisconsin.\n\nCBS Sports compiled grades for those eight coaches. Within their grades, these coaches can be placed on three tiers. Doing a good job, on the hot seat, and fired.\n\nAll eight coaches have varying degrees of notoriety, hype and expectation. Based on those factors vs the on-field results play into the letter grades. However, the grades and order might be less than predictable.\n\nNo. 1 Kenny Dillingham – Grade A\n\nCoach Dillingham is the only coach on this list of third year coaches with hardware. In 2024, Dillingham’s Sun Devils secured a Big 12 conference championship. Despite an early 3-9 start to his ASU coaching tenure, Dillingham has been an unconditional success at his alma mater.\n\nSince joining the Big 12, Arizona State has 13-5 record vs conference opponents. In addition to the Big 12 championship, Dillingham led the Sun Devils to a college football playoff berth and a top 10 finish in 2024.\n\nDillingham has a signature win against a top 10 ranked Texas Tech team, as well as a 6-2 record against ranked opponents in the last two seasons.\n\nKey at Georgia Tech is another example of a former player at the helm. A former Yellow Jackets offensive lineman has done an admirable job bringing Georgia Tech back into the national conversation.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets under Key have been bowl eligible each year under his watch and the win total peaked in 2025 reaching nine. Falling just short of making the college football playoff.\n\nIn three short seasons, Key has made Georgia Tech a contender in the ACC. Key has a 20-11 record against conference opponents. He also has signature wins against Miami and Clemson. The only ACC teams to make a national championship game in the playoff era.\n\nThe final “A” goes to Louisville coach Brohm. Brohm saw success in Louisville immediately. The Cardinals in 2023 were in the ACC Championship game and finished that season with a top 20 ranking.\n\nThe former Louisville quarterback took the head coaching job in 2023 and has quickly compiled double nine-win seasons (2024, 2025). Brohm has 28 wins in three seasons. Giving him the best winning percentage on this list.\n\nBrohm’s record against conference opponents has been inconsistent, due in some part to a late season losing streak in 2025. Regardless of where the wins come from, Brohm earns a spot on the top tier with the best win total of the group.\n\nNo. 4 Deion Sanders – Grade: C+\n\nObjectively, this feels a little high. More than any other coach on this list, Sanders capitalized on hype. With his Louis Luggage following him to Boulder, 2023 had some high points but was an objectively unsuccessful season.\n\nAfter beating TCU after their title game appearance in 2022, Sanders’ Buffs would jump out to a 3-0 record. Overnight Colorado became must see tv. In week four they were beat convincingly by Oregon and lost a close game to USC shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 2024 Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders led a pass happy offense to a 9-3 regular season record. They also played in the Alamo Bowl. Colorado was in the Big 12 title game hunt until week 11.\n\nDespite trending in the right direction in 2024, the Buffaloes had their worst season under Sanders in 2025. Sanders faced significant medical concerns during the offseason and recruiting calendar of 2025. Since then, Sanders has promised changes and overhauled the roster again. Sanders is the highest ranked coach on this list with a losing record.\n\nRhule at five when Sanders is at four is slightly confusing. However, that could be a comparison of where those respective programs are compared to where they used to be. While Sanders has returned excitement to Colorado, Rhule has yet to meet expectations.\n\nA program once viewed as a national contender is coming off two bowl eligible seasons and the first postseason win in almost a decade. Bowl eligible just simply is not the expectation.\n\nRhule has the Cornhuskers as better than they were, but 10-17 record vs conference opponents is far ‘doing a good job’. In three seasons, Rhule does not possess a quality win over an AP top 25 ranked opponent.\n\nNo 6 Scott Satterfield – Grade: C-\n\nTechnically, the Cincinnati Bearcats are trending in the right direction under Satterfield, just not as quickly as fans might have hoped. In 2023, Satterfield and the Bearcats were a 3-9 football team, with a 1-8 conference record.\n\nIn 2024 they improved to 5-7 (3-6 in conference), before finishing 7-6 (5-4 in conference) in 2025. In 2025, they finished in the top half of division 1 for the first time under Satterfield.\n\nIn 2025, Cincinnati was very active in the transfer portal. Bringing in 20 new players, mostly 3-stars from varying levels, while losing 19. The biggest loss being 5-star quarterback Brendan Sorsby to Texas Tech.\n\nFickell had become a big name after some success with Cincinnati. When Fickell was hired at Wisconsin, it was celebrated by college football viewers. The results have simply been less than expected.\n\nFickell’s Badgers made a bowl game in 2023 and the on-field production has regressed since. Fickell’s 17-21 record has led to considerable speculation on his future with the program.\n\nSurprisingly, Fickell survived the 2025 hot seat. A name that was on many short lists of coaches who could be fired in 2025. Joe Thomas, one of the greatest Badgers of all time, said firing Fickell is not the answer, in a radio interview late last year.\n\nFickell will likely begin the 2026 season where he spent the 2025 season. On the hot seat.\n\nIn three years, Coach Freeze led the Auburn Tigers to one bowl game, coming off a 6-7 record. That season, Auburn did not finish in the top half of division 1 (71st of 133).\n\n2024 and 2025 resulted in double 5-7 records. The conference record paints an even more scathing picture. Auburn, once believed to be a college football power and a leading SEC team has only three conference wins in the last two seasons.\n\nA 6-16 record against SEC teams overall in three years falls decidedly below expectations.\n\nBefore the end of the 2025 season, Auburn decided to part ways with Hugh Freeze. Alex Golesh from South Florida took over in December. Since then, the Tigers have flipped more than 39 of the players on the 2025 roster.\n\nSNL pokes fun at Michael Irvin's amped up Miami Hurricanes fandom\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Bill Belichick’s girlfriend over Hall of Fame debate\n\nGoogle changes Curt Cignetti search results following Indiana’s CFP title win\n\nEx-Indiana QB fires back after portrayal in CBS 60 Minutes interview",

But with head coach Robert Saleh planning on calling defensive plays, Bradley might lean more toward Arizona.\n\nBradley spent the last three seasons as the defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts. He has been a DC or head coach in the NFL since 2009. He has run the defenses of the Colts, Seattle Seahawks, LA Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. He was the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars from 2013-2016.\n\nHis experience would also be welcome, as LaFleur is a first-time head coach.\n\nOf course, LaFleur and Bradley have not crossed paths yet on any team, so we will see what the plan is.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "The New York Knicks spoiled what might have been LeBron James's last game at Madison Square Garden, stretching their win streak to six games with a 112-100 victory.\n\nOG Anunoby scored 25 points and reserve Landry Shamet added 23 to lead the Knicks.\n\nFour-time NBA Most Valuable Player James, a 41-year-old Lakers star, remains uncommitted beyond this season, his NBA-record 23rd. But he says playing at the Garden has meant \"everything\" to him.\n\n\"It's the Mecca of basketball in New York. It's the Big Apple. Being at MSG, so many guys have walked this court, basketball, entertainment, actors, musicians, everything. It has been a wide range of America, the people, to grace this floor,\" James said.\n\n\"I hope I'm like a small snippet of somebody that came through here and was able to make a little small dent from a visitor's perspective. It's always cool in here. I've always loved these fans.\"\n\nWhile not saying it was his Garden farewell, James noted, \"When the time comes it will always have a special place.\"\n\nJosh Hart added 20 points for the Knicks while All-Star guard Jalen Brunson had 12 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.\n\n\"We've just been playing together,\" Brunson said of their win streak. \"Sticking together, that's the biggest part, having each other's back holding each other accountable.\n\n“We have to continue to do that. Can't be satisfied. It's a collective effort.\"\n\nThe Knicks improved to 31-18, second in the Eastern Conference behind Detroit.\n\nThe Lakers fell to 29-19 despite 30 points from Luka Doncic and 22 from James, who was named to his record 22nd NBA All-Star Game as a reserve by NBA coaches.\n\n\"Super humbling,\" James said. \"Mad respect to the coaches. \"Playing at the latter stages of my career and still able to be an All-Star, it means a lot.\"\n\nIt was the first Laker loss of the season after leading at half-time.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points and added 13 assists while Cason Wallace had a career-high 27 points with seven three-pointers as reigning champions Oklahoma City won 121-111 at Denver.\n\n\"We knew we were going to have to bring it in this building if we wanted to get a W,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said.\n\nFrench star Victor Wembanyama delivered 25 points, eight rebounds, five blocked shots, four steals and two assists to ignite San Antonio's 112-103 home triumph over Orlando.\n\nThe game was pushed back to a night contest after the Spurs (33-16) had trouble flying out of snowstorm-hit Charlotte.\n\nCleveland's Jarrett Allen scored 40 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as the Cavaliers won 130-111 at Portland.\n\nDetroit claimed the most lopsided victory in team history as Jalen Duren scored 21 points while Cade Cunningham had 18 points and 12 assists in a 130-77 rout of visiting Brooklyn.\n\nSwedish guard Pelle Larsson and Bam Adebayo each scored 20 points as host Miami ripped Chicago 134-91, the third-biggest rout in Heat history.\n\nJaylen Brown had 30 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Boston Celtics over Milwaukee 107-79.\n\nRJ Barrett scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 19 for Toronto in a 107-100 home victory over Utah.

    "description": "A former Minnesota Twins pitcher is headed to LA.",
    "fullText": "Left-handed pitcher Cole Irvin agreed to a minor-league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday. The deal includes an invitation to big-league Spring Training. Irvin returns to MLB (spring training, at least) after spending the 2024 season bouncing between organizations. He then ultimately went overseas.\n\nThis move gives the Dodgers some organizational pitching depth as they sort through their options ahead of the 2026 season, looking for a third straight World Series title.\n\nIrvin last appeared in the majors in 2024 with the Minnesota Twins, where he had a brief stint. The lefty made four appearances for Minnesota, going 0-1 with a 12.27 ERA and two strikeouts across 3.2 innings. While that stint did not go well, it was just a small part of his career that has spanned multiple seasons and teams at the major-league level.\n\nThe Dodgers signed LHP Cole Irvin to a minor league deal with a spring invite, a source confirms to The Athletic. Has big league time with PHI, OAK, BAL and MIN before spending last year with the KBO’s Doosan Bears (28 GS, 4.48 ERA).@AramLeighton8 was on it.\n\n— Fabian Ardaya (@FabianArdaya) February 1, 2026\n\nAcross six MLB seasons, Irvin has logged 593 innings, tallying a 28-40 record with a 4.54 ERA and 434 strikeouts. He has appeared in 134 games (93 starts) and pitched for four different franchises during that stretch. His most notable run came with the Oakland Athletics, where he was a regular member of the rotation in 2021 and 2022, eclipsing 178 innings in each of those seasons.\n\nIrvin originally broke in with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2019 before spending time with Oakland and the Baltimore Orioles as his career progressed. His mix of starting and relief experience is part of what makes him a nice depth option for a Dodgers organization that often cycles pitchers between the majors and Triple-A throughout the season.\n\nIrvin most recently pitched overseas in the KBO with the Doosan Bears. He posted a 4.48 ERA over 144 2/3 innings while making 28 starts. That performance, while not incredible, helped put him back on the radar for the defending back-to-back champions.\n\nThe Dodgers and LHP Cole Irvin have agreed to a Minor League deal, sources tell @JustBB_Media\n\nIrvin, 32, spent last season in KBO with the Doosan Bears, where he pitched to a 4.48 ERA in 144 2/3 IP. Over parts of 6 MLB seasons (593 IP), Irvin owns a 4.54 ERA.\n\n— Aram Leighton (@AramLeighton8) February 1, 2026\n\nFor the Dodgers, Irvin is a low-risk depth option. He is not currently a projected roster piece. Los Angeles routinely stocks experienced starters on minor-league deals to protect against injuries and workload management across a long season, which could be especially important pending Blake Snell’s early-season availability. If Irvin shows enough during spring training, he could move between Triple-A and the big-league roster this season, but that would require a 40-man spot.\n\nAt 32, Irvin’s path back to major-league innings is not guaranteed, but the opportunity is a good one with the league's premier organization in the Dodgers.",

    "description": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — In their Morgan State college dorm in the mid-1990’s, Daronte Jones and Melvin Coleman stayed busy. “We did a lot of battles in Madden,” Coleman told DC News Now. “I’d be in the bed asleep it would be a Saturday and [Daronte] would walk and grab the controller and put […]",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — In their Morgan State college dorm in the mid-1990’s, Daronte Jones and Melvin Coleman stayed busy.\n\n“We did a lot of battles in Madden,” Coleman told DC News Now. “I’d be in the bed asleep it would be a Saturday and [Daronte] would walk and grab the controller and put the controller by my bed and soon I’d wake up and he’d jump back in like I don’t see him and be like, ‘oh so what you calling me out?”\n\nIn January, three decades after his Madden battles as a college football player with his roommate, and many professional and college football coaching stops, Jones has been hired as the Washington Commanders new defensive coordinator.\n\nFor Jones – it’s a homecoming. He hails from Prince George’s County, where he attended Bishop McNamara high school in Forestville, Maryland.\n\nIt’s not just his college friends and teammates who remember the Madden matchups. His good friend and teammate from Bishop McNamara Mike Jones also took part in the legendary video games matchups – though he didn’t know at the time he was facing a defensive mastermind.\n\n“He’s definitely the reason why I stopped playing Madden,” Mike said. “Cause he’s reading all your plays and this was the time when he was early in his coaching career… I’m like dude I’m playing for leisure.”\n\nDuring his college career, Daronte suffered a neck injury that kept him off the field. Coleman said Daronte would spend more time in the play calling booth during games and was earning a bigger grasp of the game. He said it showed in Madden too.\n\n“That kind of helped us being coaches and our playing careers were done,” Coleman said. “We learned how to think on the run, think quick, make adjustments quick.”\n\nYou could call Daronte’s coaching career the Daronte Jones World Tour.\n\nIt started in 2001 as a graduate assistant at Division II Lenoir-Rhyne. Coleman said Daronte conducted an interview with the school before they went on their spring break trip senior year. The following years took Jones to Nicholls State (then Division I-AA) as safeties coach, defensive coordinator jobs at high schools in Louisiana and his first return to the DMV where he served as Bowie State’s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator from 2005 to 2009.\n\nJones bounced around more after that. He was cornerbacks coach at UCLA in 2010, defensive backs coach for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League in 2011, Hawaii’s secondary coach in 2012-14 and Wisconsin’s defensive backs coach in 2015.\n\nThen, Jones made the jump to the NFL — first as the Miami Dolphins assistant defensive backs coach, then the Cincinnati Bengals cornerbacks coach, then the Minnesota Vikings defensive backs coach. After a brief stint as LSU’s defensive coordinator in 2021 where he coached star cornerback Derek Stingley Jr., Jones returned to the Vikings, where he stayed until this offseason.\n\n“For most people who think that this is a person who’s coming out of nowhere, that’s not true,” Mike Jones said. “This guy has been grinding close to over 20 years. He’s been grinding and getting information from the best minds in football.”\n\nFor Mike and Coleman, watching Daronte flourish in the football world has been meaningful, but they’ve also seen his growth as a coach.\n\n“Secondary wise, pass defense wise, everywhere he’s gone they’ve gotten better,” Coleman, who is now the safeties coach at Morgan State said. “Somebody is doing well, somebody is probably making the pro bowl. Somebody is probably making all-conference. So the proof is in the work.”\n\nSince 2023, Daronte had worked directly under Brian Flores in Minnesota. Coleman said that Daronte’s coaching influences and style comes from several different legendary coaching trees.\n\n“With him being around [Vic] Fangio, Marvin Lewis, [Mike] Zimmer, Vance Joseph and now Flores,” Coleman said. “He’s got a lot work from them. He got a lot of tape to take from them.”\n\nIn recent seasons, with Daronte serving as the team’s defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, the Vikings’ defense has played aggressively, focusing on trying to force turnovers and blitzing at some of the highest rates in the NFL.\n\nDaronte’s high school teammate Mike Jones, who is now a counselor at Bishop McNamara says the way he played was pretty similar to how his defenses play.\n\n“He was always in the right spot… When we look at those old films when we get together, he pops on film,” Mike said. “He’s always going all out.”\n\nMike said Daronte earned the nickname “Crow” because “he made crow sounds in the backfield.”\n\n“He would make these crow sounds like he’s lurking in the secondary,” Mike said. “He would take on the biggest person on the team in practice even though he was gonna get knocked down… He’s not scared.”\n\nAccording to his friends, Daronte’s days at McNamara mean a lot to him. Several years ago, Daronte donated to the Bishop McNamara football program. His contributions provide student athletes with scholarship assistance. Daronte’s name is now etched on a plaque in the McNamara locker room, noted him as a 1996 graduate and that year’s male athlete of the year. Daronte played football, wrestling and track & field at McNamara.\n\n“He’s been able to come back and give back to the community itself in terms of the program and the school,” Bishop McNamara football head coach Greg Calhoun said. “But he’s also been able to take advantage of the opportunities to give back.”\n\nCalhoun told DC News Now that he referenced Daronte as inspiration and motivation for his players and as an example to potential recruits.\n\n“I actually just had a set of recruits come through and we just showed his locker again as we always do,” Calhoun said. “A lot of great coaches out here in the world but for him to be selected for that job and that opportunity in this community, is huge.”\n\nBishop McNamara plays in one of, if not the best high school football conferences in the country, the WCAC. The Mustangs last won a WCAC championship in 1990. Since, the conference has been dominated by blue blood programs DeMatha, Gonzaga, St. John’s and Good Counsel.\n\nBut in 2025, months before Daronte being hired by the Commanders, a few seasons into his tenure in Forestville, Calhoun helped his team take a massive step forward. The Mustangs beat their rival Gonzaga, 21-0 on October 11. Gonzaga was the eventual WCAC runners-up.\n\nThe following week, McNamara fell just short to eventual undefeated WCAC champion DeMatha, 12-7. They were one of two teams to come within five points or less of the Stags all season long. It was also DeMatha’s second lowest scoring output of the season.\n\n“We’re not always the first names mentioned in that league,” Mike said. “Now we have something that we can definitely hang our hat on in conversations… Now we have the defensive coordinator of our local team.”\n\nCalhoun believes that an esteemed alum calling plays down the road, could further fuel his players.\n\n“Just knowing that you have somebody of that magnitude at that level kind of puts that pressure on you obviously as the current student in that process, just letting you know you have some big shoes to fill,” Calhoun told DC News Now. “You have some expectations, you have some standards and that’s something that we work to build here in this process and our guys take pride and value in that.”\n\nAnd while Daronte rises in the football coaching ranks, he’s still a boy from Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\n“I know growing up, everybody was like DC, DC, DC, but now it’s like PG County,” Coleman said. “We’ve got players, we’ve got ballers, we’ve got good thinkers and I think it’s just you’re proud to represent where you’re from.”\n\nAs for what Commanders fans should expects going forward, Coleman said Daronte is “a guy that’s going to be on a mission to be great. To not lose.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini men's basketball coach Brad Underwood saw his team overcome road adversity once again, as it snagged a critical road win Sunday afternoon to extend its winning streak to 11 by overcoming a talented No.5-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers team, 78-69.\n\nIt wasn't just any win. It's a microcosm of a season marked by raw, elite talent finally gelling together as the season's critical stretch run really gets going. Sunday at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln was no different, as for the second consecutive weekend, the No.9-ranked Illini took down an AP Top 5 road opponent after doing the same against the Purdue Boilermakers in West Lafayette last Saturday.\n\nIt's the first time the Illini have done so in program history, but it came with a bit of extra motivation that has since begun to circulate in the hours after the revenge win.\n\nMore specifically, the team's whiteboard. There weren't X's and O's, nor was there a diagram explaining the ways Illinois can continue to remain atop a crowded Big Ten title race with a little over a month left in the season.\n\nInstead, it was four simple words: \"Rob the [expletive] bank.\"\n\nWhether it was a jab at the arena's name or otherwise, it certainly seemed to fire up Illinois as it now holds a win against every conference opponent it's played so far.\n\nUnderwood said his players were relaxed and composed in the second half after overcoming a 39-33 halftime deficit. The Illini outscored the Cornhuskers 45-30 in the final 20 minutes, as freshman guard Keaton Wagler finished with 28 points.\n\n“Chemistry and connectivity,\" Underwood told reporters. \"Just the communication… We’ve made huge strides there and we’re competing on every play,” Underwood said.\n\nMORE: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nThe Illini are going to attempt to keep their winning streak alive Wednesday night from State Farm Center in Champaign, hosting the Northwestern Wildcats. Unlike Illinois, Northwestern has struggled to stay above .500 for much of the season and is trying to bounce back after dropping a 76-62 game to the Washington Huskies Saturday night.\n\nTip is set for 8 p.m. ET on Big Ten Network as the Illini try to sweep the season series.\n\nHubert Davis buyout, contract details as UNC Tar Heels coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nPenny Hardaway buyout, contract details as Memphis Tigers coach\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event",

    "description": "Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores has been one of the biggest storylines of Minnesota’s offseason. He was chasing head-coaching openings […]",
    "fullText": "Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores has been one of the biggest storylines of Minnesota’s offseason. He was chasing head-coaching openings and there were plenty of those. Furthermore, Minnesota’s defensive architect interviewed for another defensive coordinator position, which he was allowed to do because his contract had briefly expired.\n\nFirst, the Vikings handled the contract issue, reportedly offering him a Godfather deal. He agreed and signed the contract to return as the defensive coordinator in the Twin Cities with one caveat: If offered a promotion elsewhere, he would still depart.\n\nUltimately, he didn’t get any of those HC jobs. At this point, all 32 jobs are filled. On Sunday, reports surfaced suggesting that the Arizona Cardinals would hire Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur, brother of Green Bay’s skipper. Rams head coach Sean McVay loses another staff member.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders, meanwhile, are expected to work out a deal with Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. That contract cannot be finalized until after the Super Bowl. Kubiak worked for the Vikings between 2019 and 2021, first as the QB coach and in his final season as the offensive coordinator. He was not retained when the Vikings swapped Mike Zimmer for Kevin O’Connell. In Las Vegas, Kubiak is expected to get his hands on the potential first overall pick, Fernando Mendoza.\n\nAbout a month ago, Flores was rumored to be on Tom Brady’s shortlist of head coaching candidates, but that never got beyond the rumor stage. There’s no reported interview. In fact, Flores only interviewed for two HC vacancies, with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nHis return is good news for the Vikings. The numbers support that case; he was the driving force behind the 9–8 record, often masking the flaws of an abysmal offense.\n\nIn the three years under Flores, Minnesota has allowed just 19.2 points per game, ranking second in the NFL. The advanced numbers support his brilliance, as his group ranks near the top of the league in EPA/play and DVOA. This hasn’t just been a good defense. It’s been one of the league’s elite units for two consecutive seasons.\n\nBeyond the numbers, Flores has changed the personality of the defense. Minnesota plays faster and more aggressively than it did before his arrival, leaning into disguised coverages, creative blitz packages, and constant pressure looks that force quarterbacks into mistakes. The unit rarely sits back. Instead, it dictates terms — something the Vikings had been missing for years. That identity has become one of the clearest strengths of the team.\n\nFlores took over in 2023 after three straight seasons of underwhelming defensive performance. At first, the transition took time, as the personnel didn’t perfectly fit his system and the scheme required a steep learning curve.\n\nIn the 2024 offseason, the Vikings acquired Andrew Van Ginkel, Jonathan Greenard and Blake Cashman to strengthen the front, and it worked wonders. En route to a 14-3 record, his defense gave most quarterbacks fits in his second season with the Vikings.\n\nLast year, with an additional focus on interior pass rush, his defense allowed only a single passing touchdown in the final eight games of the campaign.\n\nWith his return, there’s real hope that a few offensive improvements could turn the Vikings into a January contender behind a championship-caliber defense.\n\nThe roster should largely remain intact, aside from Harrison Smith’s expected retirement and the potential free-agent departure of linebacker Eric Wilson. On the other hand, the Vikings could acquire some reinforcements in free agency and the draft.\n\nEditor’s Note: Information from PFF, Over The Cap, and Sports Reference helped with this article.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. — Nikita Kucherov scored the tying goal in the third period, Jake Guentzel scored the only goal in the shootout, and the Tampa Bay Lightning rallied from a four-goal deficit to beat the Boston Bruins 6-5 in front of 64,617 fans at an NHL Stadium Series game at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nKucherov finished with a goal and three assists, Brandon Hagel had a goal and two assists, while Oliver Bjorkstrand, Darren Raddysh and Nick Paul all scored power-play goals after Tampa Bay fell behind 5-1 in the second period.\n\nAndrei Vasilevskiy finished with 29 saves.\n\nTampa Bay’s four-goal comeback is the largest in NHL outdoor game history and the largest comeback victory in franchise history.\n\nMorgan Geekie had a pair of goals and three points for the Bruins. Viktor Arvidsson, Alex Steeves and Matthew Poitras also scored for Boston, which improved to 10-1-2 in the past 13 games. Charlie McAvoy had a pair of assists while Jeremy Swayman finished with 41 saves.\n\nKucherov completed Tampa Bay’s comeback with a one-timer from the left circle with 8:10 left in the third period.\n\nThe game featured the first goalie fight in outdoor game history when Vasilevskiy and Swayman exchanged blows at center ice in the second period. The Lightning pointed to the goalie fight as a spark to their comeback when they were down 5-2.\n\n“That was a game-changing moment for our team, and that’s what we needed,’’ Guentzel said. “That was definitely cool to watch.’’\n\nWith an opening puck drop temperature of 41.8 degrees Fahrenheit (5.44 Celsius), Hagel fired up the crowd with a goal just 11 seconds in — the fastest goal in NHL outdoor game history and tying a franchise history for fastest goal to start a game.\n\nThe Bruins scored the next five as Steeves, Geekie and Arvidsson all scored within a span of 7:39 to give Boston a 3-1 lead after the first. Poitras scored on a backhander at 2:22 of the second period while Geekie notched his second of the game at 8:18.\n\n“We came out strong, obviously they scored right away but we got to our game right after,’’ Geekie said.\n\nBjorkstrand scored at 10:28 to make it 5-2.\n\nThe Lightning scored a pair of five-on-three power-play goals 23 seconds apart. Raddysh scored a goal for the fourth consecutive game to set a franchise record for a defenseman. Paul then tapped in a pass from Guentzel to make it 5-4.\n\n“It was the game had everything,’’ Lightning head coach Jon Cooper said. “It had the weather in a state which doesn’t usually get weather like this. It was a phenomenal atmosphere, perfect ice hockey playing conditions. You had goalie fights, you had 11 goals, you had a shootout. It had everything. That one’s going to go in the memory bank. It was a special occasion.’’\n\nBruins: At Florida on Wednesday night.\n\nLightning: Host Buffalo on Tuesday night.",

    "title": "Fan Focus: What Can Sunderland Expect From Scott Parker’s Burnley Side Today?",
    "description": "Ahead of today’s match, we spoke to Joe of the TurfCast Podcast to discuss what to expect from Scott Parker’s side.",
    "fullText": "It seems so long ago when Burnley defeated  Sunderland back in August – how would you summarise your season since?\n\nYeah feels like a while ago doesn’t it – the season has not gone well, is an understatement. 10 points adrift by January and looking down the barrel of another relegation.\n\nScott Parker has developed a reputation for taking teams up but then struggling to keep them up. Does he still have the support of the Burnley fanbase?\n\nI can’t speak for the majority of the fan base but I do feel the majority would like a change now.\n\nWe’re 14 games without a win, and within that lost seven games in a row – it’s not good enough really.\n\nHowever we have improved slightly since then so it would be bizarre to do it now, but I wouldn’t be against it.\n\nGiven both Sunderland and Leeds at present are set to avoid relegation, has there been any frustration amongst Burnley fans that the club have weren’t more aggressive in the summer transfer window?\n\nYeah, massive. It’s not like we didn’t give it a go we just didn’t sign enough quality.\n\nI don’t think Leeds’ squad is that much better than ours though and they’ve managed to give it a proper go as they have signed that extra bit of quality and they have a manager that has now started playing on the front foot.\n\nAlthough you’re not winning games, Burnley have avoided defeat in five of your last seven matches. What is making you so tough to beat of late?\n\nI think it’s the introduction of Marcus Edwards, personally.\n\nWhy he hasn’t played more games this season is beyond me, but for whatever reason Scott Parker made him spend the majority of the season on the bench.\n\nBut since he’s come in he’s manage to relieve a bit of pressure on the defence by dragging the ball up the pitch and trying to play on the front foot – putting teams on the back foot for a few mins.\n\nWhereas before it was just constant defending with no outlet, no pressure being taken off the defence and eventually it would crack.\n\nBurnley are set to sign James Ward-Prowse on loan from Nottingham Forest – what do you think he will bring to the table?\n\nSet-pieces is the obvious answer – he hasn’t actually scored a free kick for a while in the Premier League admittedly but he’s good with corners too which is something we have struggled with.\n\nHe will probably replace the injured Josh Cullen in the midfield alongside Florentino Luis. He does improve us I have no doubt about that, but our main issues have been upfront and the back.\n\nNow we’re over halfway into the season, which players have impressed you most and who would you say has been underwhelming?\n\nMartin Dubravka has been class since coming in during the summer. He’s kept us in so many games, I genuinely feel we would be below Wolves if we had a different keeper in the net.\n\nUnderwhelming has got to be Maxime Esteve, although he has got better in the last few games he came into this season with a brilliant reputation after a great season in the Championship, but he’s made quite a few mistakes this season and been caught out a lot.\n\nIf you were Regis Le Bris, how would you exploit Burnley’s weaknesses?\n\nPlay on the front foot, get us under pressure, make the defence work and eventually someone will make a stupid mistake and give you a chance – the amount of chances we have given away from our own stupid play is ridiculous.\n\nHow do you think Parker will set up tactically at the Stadium of Light?\n\nIt will be five at the back, annoyingly. I think we have looked better with four at the back personally but Parker is far too cautious.\n\nI wouldn’t mind if we could play five at the back well but our wing-backs don’t have the pace and the centre backs are often caught out leaving us exposed.\n\nAre any players missing and what do you think the starting XI will be?\n\nI’m writing this before the press conference but as fare as I’m aware there’s about 7 players missing, including captain Josh Cullen, Zian Flemming and Joe Worrall.\n\nI imagine the starting line up would be Dubravka, Walker, Tuanzebe, Esteve, Humphreys, Pires, Big Les, Luis, Edwards, Anthony, and Foster.\n\nRomaine Mundle scored the winner when the two sides last met at the Stadium of Light – what is your prediction for the score this time around?\n\nI think it will be a tight game as it always seems to be when it comes to us two – but based on how well you have done this season I think. you come out on top – Xhaka missing does give me some hope but I still feel you have enough to beat us. 2-1 Sunlun.",

The lad has loads of class, and I think it would help massively.\n\nBurnley have managed to go three games unbeaten — although they haven’t won a game since October — so we should be going hard and making sure we’re on top at home.\n\nI think we will have too much for Burnley, in front of our fans. We were given a reality check in the reverse fixture back in August, so it’s time we repaid the favour with a strong showing.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Burnley 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Brian Brobbey\n\nThat defeat at West Ham stung because we never really got going, but being back at home usually snaps us out of that.\n\nBurnley haven’t won since October, but have drawn their last three. They’ve become more resilient but can’t pick up three points for the life of them, so if we start with a bit of intent, the game’s there for us.\n\nBrobbey should enjoy himself against their centre halves, and I think he scores to help us on our way.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 1 Burnley 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Brian Brobbey\n\nPutting our West Ham disappointment behind us, we face one of the six sides to have beaten us this season.\n\nBurnley’s return to the Premier League has been the struggle everyone expected of us, with three wins all season, — the last of which came way back in October.\n\nIt would be typical for us to go unbeaten at home to this point, and lose to a side on a fourteen-game winless streak, wouldn’t it?\n\nOne thing I’ll say is that after every defeat, we’ve followed it up well and I’ll back that to happen again tonight — but I don’t envisage a classic!\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 4 Burnley 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Lord Daniel Ballard\n\nI’m over-confident for this one, I’m aware, but I feel like Burnley will turn up thinking they have our number and that our boys know that they’re fully capable of having these over a barrel — particularly at the Stadium of Light.\n\nIt’s all about when the first goal is scored, but I reckon we’ll be 2-0 up before half time.\n\nSo 4-0 I’m going for. I don’t care if it’s overconfidence — I’m not doing very well anyway!\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 1 Burnley 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Brian Brobbey\n\nGranit Xhaka was obviously a key miss but the last match was unfortunately a stark reminder that there are no easy fixtures in the Premier League and if we’re not 100% at the races in every department, it’s unforgiving and we’ll come away empty-handed more often than not.\n\nBurnley haven’t quite turned the corner by any means, but draws in their last three league games against Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham make this a far from straightforward affair.\n\nIt looks like we’ll be without our influential skipper again so it could be a tough night, but this also represents an opportunity for the team to prove — in front of the Sky cameras — they aren’t as reliant on him as people think.\n\nI back our levels of commitment and organisation and I expect to see a change in personnel, but it’s the lack of consistent quality attacking play that leaves this one in the balance for me.\n\nI can see Brobbey continuing his run of goals but I’m not sure it’ll be enough to take all three points.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Burnley 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Enzo Le Fée\n\nWell last Saturday was a bit crap. During the first half especially, we looked lost without our talisman Granit Xhaka and West Ham probably couldn’t believe their luck.\n\nBurnley’s last three league results have been draws against Spurs, Liverpool and Manchester United, so they’ll be stubborn and be desperate to take our unbeaten home record.\n\nHopefully with the players been given a deserved few days’ break and most of them grabbing some winter sun, they’ll be refreshed, ready to go again, and to recapture their form from the start of the season.\n\nThe less we say about last weekend, the better.\n\nOur first half desire was left wanting, and before we knew it we were 3-0 down to a couple of avoidable goals and a wonder strike.\n\nWe did better in the second half with a well-created and taken goal for our number nine, but apart from Luke O’Nien hitting the crossbar corner with a cross-come-shot, we didn’t really get super close to making it a nervous finish to the game.\n\nIt was our first foray without Granit Xhaka, and if anything maybe it was useful to lose like that away from home in order to give the Lads a kick up the arse, as we probably have a couple more fixtures without the skipper to come.\n\nTonight, we have to rub our skinned knees, get back on the bike and show the fans that it was one of a few bad days away from the Stadium of Light.\n\nNone of the RR writers went for a loss and only two thought we would draw, so no points for right score or outcome.\n\nEveryone bar Jack picked Brian Brobbey to get us our first and in this case only goal, so seven of the lads get a point, and Jack gets nothing.\n\nEveryone takes one point more apart from Jack, so the table stays as was, but Martin and those below him caught up on Jack a wee bit.\n\nGair gets into double figures, which is worth a mention for sure.\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

    "description": "In a potential sliding doors moment was it this defeat at Reading that was the beginning of the end for O’Neill?",
    "fullText": "With Martin O’Neill getting Celtic back on track north of the border, it’s difficult not to think back on his time as manager of Sunderland – and think what a bloody shame it was that it didn’t work out.\n\nThinking back, it was potentially a case of being the right man at the wrong time. Maybe if he had been appointed when Niall Quinn gave him that call a few years earlier, it might have all been different – but then again, we got Roy Keane, so it kind of worked out.\n\nIt’s very easy when talking about his time at Sunderland to try and work out the point where it began to go in the wrong direction, because his appointment in December 2011 gave us the lift we needed. Steve Bruce had a shocking ending the season prior and began 2011-12 with just two wins in the first thirteen league games, that include a home defeat against the visitors, which left us hovering dangerously above the drop zone.\n\nEnter stage left, O’Neill, who had been looking for a job after leaving Aston Villa. After Seb Larsson scored that winner in his opening game at the Stadium of Light against Blackburn Rovers, he won seven in his first ten league games – and not only that, he also won three cup ties in his first three months to reach the quarter-final of the FA Cup.\n\nNow, that quarter-final. In the first game at Goodison, we were brilliant, and David Moyes was lucky to get another crack at Sunderland in the replay. We’d just beaten Liverpool at home ahead of the replay, so all seemed well. But it was disastrous. Everton rolled us over and, well, we were awful, and maybe as a consequence, we didn’t win any of the remaining eight games of the season.\n\nBut, new season, new hope, and all of that.\n\nHowever, O’Neill was told that the purse strings wouldn’t be opened and he’d have to pretty much make do – something he has said since would have probably steered him away from taking the job on in the first place. Two free transfers made their debut in the opening day goalless draw against Arsenal at the Emirates, with Carlos Cuellar in the starting XI and Louis Saha making an appearance from the bench.\n\nWe won just two of the first fifteen games.\n\nThere was, however, a mini-revival as we bounced back to win five of the next eight games, which propelled us back up to the safety of mid-table, just as Swansea City travelled to the Stadium of Light in the final game within the January transfer window.\n\nThe game against the Swans would end in a goalless draw, but perhaps the most significant event of the night was Danny Graham entering the field of play as a substitute for the final fifteen minutes of the game, as he was in talks to sign for Sunderland in a deal worth around £5m.\n\nNext up was a trip to the Madejski Stadium to take on Brian McDermott’s Reading, who were nine points behind us and only out of the relegation zone via goal difference. Graham was named on the bench by O’Neill after his transfer was confirmed ahead of the game, and less than ten minutes into the gam,e most people assumed his services would be required at some point.\n\nThis was due to Jimmy Kebe’s opener, which arrived after seven minutes, after good work from Jobi McAniff cutting the ball across the box. Kebe wrong-footed the Sunderland defence to provide time to pick his spot to score past Simon Mignolet from around ten yards out.\n\nBut O’Neill’s Sunderland fought back, and Adam Federici was forced into good saves to deny Alfred N’Diaye and Larsson, but just before the half hour, the Lads were awarded a penalty. Pavel Pogrebnyak was adjudged to have fouled John O’Shea when defending a corner, and Craig Gardner levelled things up from the spot.\n\nBoth sides pushed to take maximum points, and with ten minutes to go, O’Neill brought off Stephane Sessegnon and sent on his new signing from Swansea City – and “a huge roar from the travelling Sunderland fans greeted Graham”.\n\nAlmost immediately, it paid off, but Graham’s close-range header was brilliantly saved to concede a corner – it could all have been so different had that gone in.\n\nBecause the sucker punch came with five minutes to go. Sunderland gave away a sloppy free-kick, and everyone’s favourite agent Ian Harte swung the ball in, and it was met by the head of Keb,e who scored his second goal of the game, which turned out to be the winner.\n\nA point would have seen us take a place in the top half of the Premier League, but instead we lost four and drew two in the next six games, and O’Neill was sacked as manager of Sunderland.\n\nSunderland: Mignolet, Gardner, O’Shea, Bramble, Colback, Larsson (Rose), N’Diaye, Vaughan (McClean), Johnson, Sessegnon (Graham), Fletcher Subs: Westwood, Bardsley, Mangane, Wickham\n\nReading: Federici, Kelly, Harte, Leigertwood, Pearce, Mariappa, Kebe, Akpan, Pogrebnyak (Blackman), McAnuff, McCleary (Le Fondre) Subs: Taylor, Shorey, Morrison, Karacan, Guthrie",

    "description": "Top 10: The Second World War Fighters Souped-Up for Extreme Air Racing",
    "fullText": "Reno Air Racing, described as ‘the world’s fastest motorsport’, is a blistering blend of aviation heritage, extreme engineering and thrilling speed.\n\nHeld in the Nevada desert, it pits legendary warbirds against one another in low-level, high-G duels around a pylon course. These aircraft, once icons of combat, are now stripped, clipped and polished to extremes.\n\nEngines are souped-up, wings shortened, cooling systems re-engineered — all in the relentless pursuit of speed. Prop tips blur, exhausts roar, and pilots skim the desert floor, often at over 450 mph. It’s not just racing; it’s the ultimate fusion of history, danger, and adrenaline.\n\nThe Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, famed for its shark-mouthed nose art and rugged wartime service, found a second life roaring over Reno’s desert skies. Once a symbol of wartime grit, it became a rare but thrilling sight among the sleek Mustangs and Bearcats dominating the Unlimited Class air races.\n\nUnlike the supercharged, high-altitude racers built later in the war, the P-40E was a tough, low-to-mid-altitude fighter, never the fastest — but its broad wings, throaty Allison engine, and unmistakable silhouette made it unforgettable. Racers who chose the Warhawk prized its stability and character, favouring heritage over outright performance.\n\nTo compete, mechanics stripped out armour, guns, and unnecessary weight, tuned the Allison V-1710 for maximum output, and polished every inch of its metal to minimise drag. Some even fitted larger props and fuel tweaks, wringing every last knot from its classic frame. The transformation kept the Warhawk’s soul but pushed its limits.\n\nP‑40s have occasionally raced at Reno, often in the Bronze or Unlimited classes. Airframes like Texas Warhawk (2017) reached qualifying speeds near 292 mph, with race speeds around 270 mph.\n\nThe F8F Bearcat was the ultimate example of Grumman’s pantheon of piston-engined naval fighters. The company’s earlier Hellcat had been instrumental in defeating Japan, and the Bearcat was even more potent. Compact, with immaculate handling, the F8F was utterly brilliant.\n\nLong before the Bearcat had entered the realm of racing, it snatched the absolute climb rate record for piston-engined aircraft, whizzing up to 10,000 feet in 94 seconds in 1946. Fast and with a strong structure that lent itself to modification, the Bearcat was a ripe candidate for the Reno races.\n\nRare Bear is a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, rebuilt by pilot Lyle Shelton from a crashed airframe in 1969 for air racing. Fitted with a powerful Wright R-3350 radial engine producing over 4000 horsepower, it became one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 1989, Rare Bear set a 3 km (1.86 mile) world speed record of 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h). With shortened wings, aerodynamic refinements, and distinctive “bear” artwork, it dominated the Unlimited Class at the Reno Air Races.\n\nThere is much debate over what the ultimate piston-engined fighter was; some offer the P-51H, P-47N, or other types for this prestigious, subjective ranking, but the two most common candidates are the American Grumman Bearcat and the British Hawker Sea Fury. This sense of rivalry between these two brilliant radial-engined naval fighters carries on over eighty years after their first flights. Though the Sea Fury did not serve in the war, we will include it as it took its first flight in 1945.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury T.Mk 20 Dreadnought began life as a two-seat Royal Navy trainer, designed to familiarise pilots with the high-powered radial engine and handling characteristics of the single-seat fighter variants. When converted for air racing, Dreadnought underwent extensive modifications.\n\nThe rear seat was removed, structural reinforcements were added, and a Pratt & Whitney R‑4360 radial engine, producing around 3,800 hp, replaced the standard powerplant. These changes enabled the aircraft to safely handle extreme speeds and high g-forces on the pylon course while maintaining control over its large airframe.\n\nDreadnought reached qualifying speeds of 452.7 mph (according to unofficial sources) in 1986 and, piloted by Joel Swager in 2018, achieved a Gold Unlimited victory at Reno with a race speed of 417.735 mph. Over its career, it accumulated multiple wins and several second-place finishes, demonstrating remarkable consistency and reliability despite its size. The September Fury is another Hawker Sea Fury turned Reno Unlimited racer.\n\nThe Vought F4U Corsair, (and the Goodyear F2G Super Corsair) is a legendary Second World War naval fighter, famed for its distinctive inverted gull wings and powerful Pratt & Whitney radial engine. It served with the United States Navy and Marines in the Pacific, excelling in both air‑to‑air combat and ground‑attack roles, reaching speeds of around 446 mph in standard military form (we’ve used a wartime Corsair image here).\n\nIts combination of agility, firepower, and durability made it a favourite among pilots and a feared adversary in the skies, cementing its place in aviation history. The Corsair at Reno is a rare and captivating sight, one of the few warbirds of its kind to race in the Unlimited Class. Its presence is significant because very few Corsairs were ever modified or maintained for competitive racing, making it a true gem for air-race enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Reno Air Races, modified Corsairs proved remarkable in the Unlimited Class. The F4U‑derived Super Corsair N31518, piloted by Steve Hinton, won the Unlimited Gold in 1985, averaging 438.186 mph over the eight‑lap course. Goodyear F2G N5588N, known as Race 57, was restored and entered competition in 1999, achieving impressive results.\n\nTheir participation was rare, as few Corsairs were ever adapted for racing, and each airframe brought both historical significance and thrilling performance to the event. The aircraft’s gull wings give it instant charisma. Despite a relative scarcity of usable photographs, the Corsair’s speed rand rarity prestige make it an essential inclusion on our list.\n\n‘Steadfast’ began life as one of a batch of 10 modern Yak-3Us built in the early 2000s in Romania by Avioane Craiova. The original Yak-3U was an experimental Yak-3 development fitted with a radial ASh-82 engine in place of the usual V-12 Klimov which did not enter production but several replicas have been built.\n\nMost replicas destined for owners in the west received R-1830 engines but when Will Whiteside acquired this Yak as an unfinished, engineless, potential racer project, he decided to install a rather more potent Pratt & Whitney R-2000, as fitted to the DC-4, but tuned to deliver 1750hp.\n\nCompared to most Reno racers, 1750hp doesn’t sound that much but the Yak airframe is light, small and streamlined. Steadfast (a name derived from Reno’s Stead airport and the intention to go fast) raced at Reno for six years and attained first place in the Unlimited Silver in 2012.\n\nThe aircraft benefited from significant aerodynamic work to remove drag, it utilises an oversized spinner (from an A-26) and an afterspinner to smooth airflow through the cowling Steadfast ultimately set nine speed and climb records, including the speed record for its class at 416mph. Since 2017 Steadfast has been based in New Zealand.\n\nThe P‑51 Mustang became a common choice for air racers in America due to the large number of surplus airframes available after World War II. Its robust design, high-speed potential, and adaptability made it ideal for conversion into Unlimited Class racers, and “Strega” emerged as one of the most successful and recognisable examples.\n\nStrega, a highly modified P‑51D, dominated the Reno Air Races for decades. Powered by a tuned Packard Merlin engine producing over 3000 hp, it could reach qualifying speeds exceeding 500 mph.\n\nIts aerodynamic refinements, including clipped wings, polished surfaces, and custom cooling systems, allowed it to maintain exceptional control through tight pylon turns at extreme velocities, a key factor in its repeated victories.\n\nOver its racing career, Strega won the Unlimited Gold Class multiple times, often competing head-to-head with other top Mustangs like Dago Red and Precious Metal. Its consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps made it a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining World War 2-era airframes with modern engineering and tuning.\n\nBeyond speed, Strega’s legacy lies in its influence on piston-engine racing. Its dominance highlighted the advantages of the P‑51 platform, inspiring other racers to optimise weight, aerodynamics, and power to compete at the highest levels of the Reno Air Races.\n\nDago Red is a North American P‑51 Mustang (44‑74996) restored as a competitive air racer by Frank Taylor in 1981. Taylor piloted Dago Red to numerous world records and championship victories during the 1980s. In 1983 at Mojave, California, the aircraft set a 15 km world speed record of 517.323 mph, highlighting its extreme performance and engineering.\n\nOver its racing career, Dago Red achieved repeated success at the Reno Air Races, including winning the Gold Unlimited class in 1982. It secured the Thompson Trophy in 2003 with a fastest lap of 512.164 mph and fastest race speed of 507.105 mph.\n\nIn 2001, it recorded the fastest qualifying speed at Reno at 497.797 mph. Across two decades, Dago Red won the National Championship Air Races six times (1982, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003), cementing its reputation as one of the premier piston-engine racers in the world.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a race-tuned Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, estimated at 3500–3800 hp, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard paddle propeller. Its lightweight 7200 lb empty weight and 32 ft wingspan allow it to handle tightly around pylons at extreme speeds. With a maximum speed exceeding 520 mph and a rate of climb of 8,000 ft/min, Dago Red remains a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the pinnacle of Mustang performance and Taylor’s piloting skill.\n\nThe P‑51XR, known as Precious Metal, was built in 1988 for high-speed air racing and should not be confused with the original P‑51D or the replica Precious Metal II. It is one of the most radical and exciting modified Mustangs ever created, combining a classic airframe with extreme engineering.\n\nIt retained the P‑51 fuselage but incorporated a Rolls‑Royce Griffon 57A engine producing dramatically more horsepower than the original Merlin. To handle the immense torque, it used contra-rotating propellers from an Avro Shackleton (the same Griffon/contra arrangement was tested on the cancelled MB5 fighter), significantly improving stability and allowing pilots to exploit full power without losing control during tight pylon turns at Reno.\n\nThis mighty propulsion system combined with structural reinforcements to cope with the Griffon’s power, made Precious Metal one of the most capable and aggressive piston-engine racers ever built, pushing a WWII-era fighter far beyond its original limits.\n\nIts debut at the 1988 Reno Air Races immediately marked it as a contender, though early mechanical issues limited performance. Over time, it earned multiple podium finishes in the Unlimited Class, including a sixth-place finish in the Gold race. As an intriguing aside, the wartime Martin-Baker MB5 also adopted a Griffon/contra arrangement, a spectacular fighter prototype that did not enter production.\n\nThe Red Baron, a heavily modified P‑51D Mustang (NX7715C / 44‑84961), became one of the most iconic competitors in the Reno Air Races. Originally entered under various names, including Race #5 “Miss RJ” and “Roto‑Finish,” it was later reborn as Red Baron, with extensive modifications to maximise speed and performance.\n\nFrom its earliest appearances in 1966, the aircraft demonstrated competitive potential, qualifying 10th at 283.770 mph and finishing 5th in the consolation race at 304.990 mph. By 1968, Red Baron had established itself as a serious contender, qualifying 1st at 379.650 mph and finishing 2nd in the championship race at 386.852 mph. Subsequent years saw further improvements, and by 1971 it qualified 1st at 419.501 mph, finishing 4th in the championship at 412.101 mph.\n\nThe aircraft’s performance improvements came from detailed engineering modifications: the airframe was lightened by removing non-essential equipment, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was race-tuned to over 3,500 hp, and aerodynamic refinements—including a custom four-blade Hamilton Standard propeller, polished surfaces, and modified control surfaces—reduced drag while increasing stability through tight pylon turns.\n\nThough we have focused on the hardware, the pilot skills demonstrated by the Reno pilots is masterly. Competitors needed precise throttle management and exacting handling to safely maintain speeds exceeding 400 mph near the ground. Red Baron’s consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps cemented its place as one of the most formidable Unlimited Class racers in Reno history.\n\nThe North American P‑51D Mustang Voodoo, piloted by Steve Hinton Jr., is widely recognised as the fastest piston‑engine propeller aircraft in the world. Its record-breaking performance at the Reno Air Races showcased the incredible potential of carefully modified warbirds. Every detail, from aerodynamics to engine tuning, was optimised for sheer speed.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, Voodoo achieved an astonishing average speed of 531.64 mph (855.59 km/h) over the three‑kilometre course. This feat required not only a meticulously prepared aircraft but a pilot of extraordinary skill and courage.\n\nThe Mustang’s balance of power, control, and agility made it perfect for the tight, high-speed turns of Reno’s Unlimited Class racing. Voodoo's crowning moment came in 1972, when it won the championship race at 416.160 mph.\n\nLater modifications, including a Rolls‑Royce Griffon engine and contra‑rotating propellers, pushed the aircraft to new extremes, achieving 1st-place qualifying at 427 mph and winning the championship at 415 mph in 1978.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "fullText": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz thinks he might get a small kangaroo tattooed on one leg.\n\nIt would be a lasting memento of his win over Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open men's final Sunday which made him the youngest male player at 22 to complete a career Grand Slam.\n\n“I already know it’s going to be a kangaroo. I just don’t know the place,” Alcaraz said. “I’m just thinking about the leg but I don’t know which calf, whether it will be the right or left one.”\n\nAlcaraz posed for photographers Monday with the ornate Australian Open trophy, looking casually stylish in black, in loafers and no socks. The photo shoot took place at the Royal Exhibition Building among gardens in central Melbourne.\n\nThe women's singles winner Elena Rybakina was photographed with her trophy Saturday on the banks of the Yarra River, which runs through Melbourne.\n\nAccording to Australian media reports, Alcaraz spent the night after his victory with his family in his hotel suite, ordering pizza, beer and champagne.\n\nIn a social media post to fans during the photo shoot, Alcaraz said “I still can't believe that I just made it.\n\n“A dream come true for me, a career Grand Slam. I'm enjoying this amazing moment. I can't forget the support and the love I've received.”\n\nAfter completing a 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 over Djokovic, a 10-time Australian Open champion, Alcaraz admitted “I hate to lose.”\n\nHe explained his mindset at the moment of victory.\n\n“Before the last point ... a lot of things came to my mind, to be honest,” Alcaraz said. “I was really nervous, I was shaking almost. So once I saw the ball go out, I was like ‘alright, I made it.’\n\n“It was a great feeling, thinking about my family and my team as well.”\n\nHe has now set his sights of winning every major prize in tennis: three Masters 1000 titles that have eluded him, a season-ending championship and a Davis Cup with Spain. He has won six of the nine Masters 1000 crowns but has yet to win the Canadian Open, Shanghai and the Paris Masters.\n\n“I hate to lose, so that’s my motivation. Trying to lose as less as I can,” Alcaraz said. “Yeah, there are some tournaments that I really wanted to win at least once. A few Masters 1000 I just really wanted to complete all the Masters 1000, trying to win each one at least once.\n\n“Obviously the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup is a goal as well. I really wanted to achieve that for my country, for Spain. I set up some other goals for the season and I will try to be ready for, or to try to get those goals.”\n\nAlcaraz joined Don Budge, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic as only the ninth man to win all four Grand Slams. He was younger than Budge by 91 days and considerably younger than Nadal who was 24 and three months, Federer almost 28 and Djokovic 29.\n\n“I’m going to say tennis really beautiful but the bad part of tennis is we have tournaments week after week after week and sometimes you don’t realize what you’ve been doing lately,” he said. “Because once you finish a tournament, you’ve got to be prepared and your mind is about going to the next tournament.\n\n“What I’ve learned this year is to appreciate and enjoy every single second of the moment you’re living. Not only lifting the trophies but playing tournaments, playing tennis, getting victories, getting losses. Whatever it is, just enjoy and appreciate the life you’re living.”\n\nWhile Alcaraz has acknowledged the 38-year-old Djokovic as an inspiration, he's not sure he will be as durable.\n\n“You know, let’s see how long I will be playing. Hopefully being in such a great shape at 38, competing and challenging the young players, and playing finals of grand slams.”\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

    "fullText": "Kingdom Arena is no stranger to hosting heavyweight bouts, and Monday night’s clash between Al Hilal and Al Ahli is the main event of another epic round of Roshn Saudi League action.\n\nAfter opening a seven-point lead at the summit, back-to-back draws for Al Hilal has seen that advantage cut to only three points and, with eight wins on the bounce, Al Ahli arrive as the RSL’s form team ready to throw the season wide open.\n\nVictory would see the Jeddah giants draw level with Al Hilal at the summit, while an Al Hilal triumph would keep their rivals at bay and cement them as the team to beat this campaign.\n\nMatches don’t come any bigger than this; just cast the mind back to the corresponding fixture this season and that epic \"crazy, wild\" Al Ahli comeback. Conveniently, here are five areas in which this return blockbuster bout will be decided.\n\nThe key battles aren’t just confined to the 22 players on the pitch; the tactical battle between two of the sharpest minds in the RSL will be just as compelling.\n\nIt’s not just the Riyadh-Jeddah divide that separates the coaches, - they also come from different generations, different countries and different schools of football. However, they share a common trait in that both are proven winners.\n\nWhile each has a clear philosophy, both Inzaghi and Jaissle have demonstrated over several years an adaptability and flexibility with their tactics to achieve the ultimate result.\n\nOn the grand stage on Monday, expect both to come armed with more than just one trick up their sleeve to get the upper hand.\n\nNow both in their third season in the RSL, the rival goalkeepers are still at the absolute top of their game, with Mendy ranked No.1 in the 2025-26 RSL for clean sheets, keeping seven in his 11 games this season, while Bono isn’t far behind, with four.\n\nPerhaps most intriguingly, the two come head-to-head again just two weeks after meeting in one of the most memorable Africa Cup of Nations finals in living memory.\n\nOn that occasion, it was Mendy who came out on top, saving a late penalty before Senegal went on to win in dramatic fashion in extra-time. Can CAF Goalkeeper of the Year Bono exact a slice of revenge back in club football?\n\nNo striker in the league is as hot as Toney right now, with 13 goals in his past eight games and, incredibly, two hat-tricks in his past three.\n\nThen factor in his record against Al Hilal, with five goals in his past two games against the Riyadh giants, including a treble in their last clash at Kingdom Arena, in March. Stopping the Englishman is priority No.1, two, and three for Al Hilal.\n\nIn good news for Inzaghi, the match will see Koulibaly return from injury - the 2025 AFCON winner’s availability timely for a side that has gone five games without keeping a clean sheet.\n\nIt’s often said that matches are won in midfield, and this should be exactly where the momentum of this mammoth encounter will be set. Time and again, Neves has demonstrated his importance to this Al Hilal side, just as he did last time out against Al Qadsiah.\n\nWhether it’s controlling the tempo, his passing into the final third or his set-piece delivery, when Al Hilal win it’s usually on the back of a strong Neves performance. The same is also true of Kessie and his impact on Al Ahli: the Ivorian brings big-game know-how and huge leadership.\n\nGetting on top in midfield will be crucial in deciding the outcome of this one, and Al Ahli have shown - both in recent league matches and on the continent - they are more than capable of going toe-to-toe in that area of the park.\n\nTwo of the league’s most mercurial players, this is a showdown of the superstars. Both Al Dawsari and Mahrez are the barometers for their sides, players that offer that spark of creativity to break a game open.\n\nAl Dawsari showed all his brilliance last time out with a spectacular 90th-minute equaliser against Al Qadsiah, after earlier winning a penalty with some trademark quick feet in the box.\n\nMahrez, meanwhile, has a wand of a left foot. His first-time touch and control to set up Toney’s opener against Al Ettifaq was exquisite in its apparent ease - to Mahrez, at least.\n\nWhich player will land the knockout blow at Kingdom Arena?",

    "description": "Former WBA super lightweight champion Valenzuela had to overcome some adversity in his Zuffa Boxing debut.",
    "fullText": "Jose \"Rayo\" Valenzuela had to overcome some adversity in his Zuffa Boxing debut.\n\nValenzeula fought through a horrible cut to win a wide unanimous decision over Diego Torres in the headliner of Zuffa Boxing 2 on Sunday night at Meta Apex in Las Vegas.\n\nValenzuela was awarded nine out of 10 rounds on all three of the judges' scorecards for his return to 135 pounds. It was the first time the former WBA super lightweight champion had fought since losing his title to Gary Antuanne Russell this past March in New York.\n\nA worrisome cut opened up over the right eye of Valenzuela (15-3, 9 KOs) in Round 4, courtesy of a left hook from Torres.\n\nJose Valenzuela has a horrible cut in Round 4 as a result of a punch from Torres! pic.twitter.com/LVYcu6B1Iu\n\n— Tokkerū (@ATokkers5) February 2, 2026\n\nTorres (22-2, 19 KOs), who had won four fights in a row since being stopped by current IBF lightweight champion Raymond Muratalla in late 2023, pressured Valenzuela in the first half of the fight. Despite Valenzuela only being awarded a single round in the contest, the first half of the bout was evenly contested, with both men getting off some of their punches.\n\nEven after suffering a cut, Valenzuela seemed to go up a level in the second half of the contest. Torres' output slowed in the later rounds, which allowed Valenzuela to time Torres' attacks and counter him effectively. The former champion was able to walk Torres into southpaw left hands. Torres' lack of head movement meant that he took power shots from Valenzuela on his gloves, which had an accumulative effect over time, as Torres was taking some of the power out of the punches, but they were still having an impact.\n\nValenzuela's experience at the world level was the difference. He wasn't overwhelmed by Torres' aggression, and instead was aware that if he weathered an early storm, his own speed and silky skills would take over after Torres' initial surge — and that is exactly what happened.\n\n\"I never got handouts,\" Valenzuela said after his win. \"I'm just used to taking hard fights. Life's been hard, and I don't look for easy routes. My opponent — I want to [thank him]. I appreciate him for taking this fight. He's a dog, he only had one loss, and he showed why he's so tough today.\"\n\nIn the night's co-feature, Serhii Bohachuk (27-3, 24 KOs) returned to winning ways with a split decision victory over the former WBA (Regular) welterweight beltholder Radzhab Butaev (15-2, 12 KOs).\n\nBohachuk and Butaev produced a thoroughly entertaining 10-round, close-range slugfest. Butaev, who hadn't fought at the world level for four years and was stepping up two weight classes from his last significant fight, clearly felt the pace and non-stop pressure offered by Bohachuk, which caused him to slow down in the second half of the bout.\n\nAlthough Butaev was landing the harder shots on the inside, Bohachuk set a frenetic pace and sustained it for the 10-round period. Butaev retreated to the back foot for much of the second half of the bout, choosing to counter Bohachuk coming in and picking his shots rather than trying to match Bohachuk's volume and going punch for punch with him.\n\nIt was a tight contest, but the stronger finish from Bohachuk nudged him in front.\n\n🚨 BOHACHUK EDGES BUTAEV IN WAR \n\n✅ Serhii Bohachuk wins a split decision (96-94, 94-96, 96-94) over Radzhab Butaev in a action-packed 10-round middleweight fight. pic.twitter.com/UD7xgm0BzG\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) February 2, 2026\n\nIn the main card opener, Radivoje Kalajdzic (30-3, 21 KOs) produced a stunning turnaround victory over ex-WBC light heavyweight titlist Oleksandr Gvozdyk (21-3, 17 KOs).\n\nIt was an ideal start for Gvozdyk, who floored Kalajdzic in Round 1 with a left-hook-to-right-hand two-piece. Gvozdyk was seemingly proving to be too skilled for Kalajdzic, as he consistently found a home for power shots upstairs. In Round 4, it was a right hand to the body that sank Kalajdzic to the canvas for a second time. Although Kalajdzic beat the count, his defense was clearly letting him down, and Gvozdyk appeared well on his way to a stoppage victory.\n\nBut in Round 7, Kalajdzic produced a shocking comeback, rocking Gvozdyk in the final minute with a second right hand that floored the former champion. Gvozdyk rose from the canvas only to succumb to another right hand that sent him down for a second time. Gvozdyk tried to get to his feet, but he stumbled back onto the ring ropes, which forced the referee to stop the fight.\n\nAt the time of the stoppage, Kalajdzic had lost every round on two scorecards and was awarded just one round on the third card.\n\n‼️ Radivoje Kalajdzic gets knocked down twice, loses every round and then drops Oleksandr Gvozdyk twice in Round 7 and stops him. What a comeback!pic.twitter.com/8YfOvwLYB0\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) February 2, 2026\n\nOverall, Zuffa Boxing's second card was a marked improvement from the first show.

    "description": "BBC Sport Wales looks at key moments in the history of the world third oldest football association, formed in Wrexham on 2 February, 1876.",
    "fullText": "It is perhaps little wonder that Wrexham can feel like the centre of Welsh football given it was the birthplace of the Football Association of Wales (FAW).\n\nOn 2 February, 1876 only the third football association in the world was formed following a meeting at the town's Wynnstay Arms Hotel.\n\nLlewelyn Kendrick, a solicitor, was appointed chairman with Hawley Edwards taking the role of treasurer.\n\nA century and a half later the FAW is unrecognisable from the association established in the three story Georgian red-brick hotel that still stands in the centre of Wrexham today.\n\nBBC Sport Wales looks back at the most significant moments in the association's history.\n\n'Welsh wizard' Wilson targets Europe and World Cup\n\nA warrior touched by tragedy - Terry Yorath obituary\n\nFAW chief executive Mooney extends contract to 2030\n\nFounded three years after the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and 13 after the FA in England, the FAW is the third oldest football association in the world.\n\nSome seven weeks later - on 25 March, 1876 - the Wales men's team played their first international match, losing 4-0 away to Scotland at Partick.\n\nA year later, Scotland travelled to Wrexham and beat Wales 2-0 in their first home international at the Racecourse Ground - now named Stok Cae Ras - which remains the oldest international football stadium still in use.\n\nWales had to wait four years until 1881 for their first victory when John Vaughan scored the only goal to clinch a 1-0 win over England in Blackburn.\n\nThe 1950s marked a golden era for the Wales men's team, featuring iconic players such as John and Mel Charles, Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Trevor Ford and Terry Medwin.\n\nWorld Cup qualification was achieved for the first time in 1958 following a defeat of Israel in a play-off.\n\nThe tournament was held in Sweden and Wales faced the hosts, Mexico and Hungary in the group stages.\n\nAll three Wales group games ended level, but Jimmy Murphy's side booked a place in the quarter-finals with a play-off win against Hungary.\n\nGoals from Allchurch and Medwin set up a tie against Brazil, but Wales would be without their talisman John Charles who was injured in the game after some ferocious treatment from the Hungarians.\n\nA 17-year-old Pele scored the only goal as Brazil won the quarter-final 1-0 but almost 70 years on Welsh football fans still wonder what might have been had Charles lined up to face Brazil.\n\nIt took more than a century for the FAW to formally recognise a women's national team.\n\nInitially established in 1973, the team received no support from the FAW as players were forced to arrange their own training sessions and matches as well as funding it themselves.\n\nA crowd of around 3,500 witnessed their first fixture against the Republic of Ireland in Llanelli, and saw Wales play in kits borrowed from Swansea City's men's team.\n\nWearing shirts several sizes too big for them, Gaynor Blackwell and Gloria O'Connell scored the side's first goals in a 3-2 defeat.\n\nTwo decades passed before the FAW would take official control of the women's side.\n\nIn 1993 players Laura McAllister, Michele Adams and Karen Jones successfully persuaded association secretary Alun Evans to finally take responsibility for the Wales women's team.\n\nConcerns over Wales' status as an independent football nation grew in the 1980s which many felt threatened the very existence of the FAW.\n\nLeading Welsh clubs competed in the English pyramid system, and the absence of a national domestic league was a source of indignation to many FIFA members.\n\nIn response, the League of Wales was formed in 1992.\n\nSome clubs, including Newport County, Merthyr Town and Colwyn Bay rejected an invitation to join and were forced to play their non-league league matches in the English system outside Wales.\n\nTwenty teams took part in the inaugural season of the new League of Wales and Cwmbran were crowned the first champions.\n\nSince 1992 the league has undergone several changes and is now known as the Cymru Premier, featuring 12 teams.\n\nThe New Saints are the competition's most successful club and have won the title on 17 occasions.\n\nThe summer of 2016 is immortalised in Welsh football folklore.\n\nWales had not qualified for a major international tournament since the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden.\n\nEuro 2016 in France gave a squad dubbed the 'golden generation' an opportunity to shine on the international stage.\n\nStars such as Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams led a squad of players to the summer of their lives.\n\nWales topped a group containing Slovakia, England and Russia, before beating Northern Ireland in Paris in the last 16.\n\nIn the quarter-finals they faced one of the tournament favourites, Belgium, in Lille.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu scored one of the most iconic goals in Wales' history in a 3-1 win that ranks as one of the best results in the 150 year history of Welsh international football.\n\nWithout the suspended Ramsey and Ben Davies, Wales were beaten by eventual Euro 2016 winners Portugal.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the semi-final in Lyon, but Euro 2016 remains a defining chapter for the national side.\n\nQualification for Euro 2025 marked a landmark moment for women's football in Wales.\n\nHead coach Rhian Wilkinson and her players secured their place in Welsh footballing history by reaching a major international tournament finals for the first time.\n\nThe tournament was held in Switzerland and Wales faced world class opponents in the group stage.\n\nHeavy defeats to the Netherlands, France and England on the pitch were countered by some unforgettable moments including the singing of the national anthem before the opening match against the Netherlands, Jess Fishlock's goal against France and the passionate support of the Red Wall.\n\nThe hope now is that Euro 2025 will inspire more girls and women to take up the sport in Wales.\n\nEarly signs are encouraging, with more than 20,000 girls and women now registered to play football.\n\nThe next target is qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup, as Wales look to add another memorable chapter to the story of the national team.\n\n'World Cup could earn millions for Welsh grassroots'\n\n'We have so much to thank Terry for' -

    "fullText": "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has announced a Here We Go for Chelsea to recall Mamadou Sarr from his loan at Strasbourg.\n\nThis occurred late on Sunday evening as we head into another January transfer deadline day today, and after Chelsea lost out on signing Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes.\n\nThe Blues have been on the hunt for a new defender all window and it looks like they are now just going to settle on recalling Sarr from sister club Strasbourg to fill that void and provide Liam Rosenior with the new centre back that he wants.\n\nAaron Anselmino is about to leave Chelsea on loan for Strasbourg to cover the departure of Sarr there, after some interesting accusations of tapping up from Dortmund, the last team he was with.\n\nSo this was the domino transfer move that we have been speaking about and hearing about in the last few days that has now come to fruition as Jacquet looks set to head to Liverpool instead.\n\nMamadou Sarr strides through midfield.

We were hearing that Chelsea wanted to add an elite level centre back to come in and they had more than just one target for that.\n\nSeemingly, none of that was true.",

    "fullText": "Lakers reportedly attempting to outbid Suns, Knicks for Pelicans' $20M 21 PPG sniper originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are approaching the NBA trade deadline with several different options on the table. They could make a major move to benefit the team this season, make more subtle additions, or choose to sit tight. No matter the approach, LeBron James’ priority remains the same: competing for a championship.\n\n“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,” Rich Paul told ESPN. “He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we've had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.”\n\nJames has been an intriguing figure to monitor as the season has progressed. During the summer, there was an unusual dynamic between the Lakers and James, one that prompted ESPN’s Brian Windhorst to suggest a trade could be possible.\n\n“My conversations over the last 3 days have crystallized that the Lakers are essentially viewing LeBron as an expiring contract... I'm just unlocking the door because I am not as convinced as before if it's impossibility,” Windhorst said.\n\nWhile James does not appear likely to be moved at the deadline, the Lakers are focused on building around him and Luka Dončić. One name to monitor is New Orleans Pelicans forward Saddiq Bey, especially after Keon Ellis and De’Andre Hunter were moved in the same deal.\n\n“The Knicks, Lakers and Suns are among the teams to recently inquire with the Pelicans on Saddiq Bey. Over the past month, Bey is averaging 21.2 points, 6 rebounds and 2.6 assists while shooting 44.4% on threes. Bey is generating strong trade interest during his hot stretch,” NBA reporter Evan Sidery wrote.\n\nAs currently constructed, the Lakers are not built to make a championship run or seriously contend. However, a few well-timed moves could drastically change the trajectory of their season.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Lakers’ front office navigates the trade deadline, given the multiple timelines currently on the roster. If Los Angeles opts to stand pat, it will be clear that the organization is preparing to go all-in during free agency this summer.",

    "fullText": "After missing around a month of NBA action, Nikola Jokic returned to the court on January 30th against the Los Angeles Clippers, and he looked a hundred percent like his old self. The only problem was that he didn’t play as long as he normally would, and that irked Charles Barkley.\n\nThe Nuggets won 122-109 against the Clippers, and Jokic scored 31 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. It was business as usual for the Joker, whose return will only bolster the Denver Nuggets’ post-season hopes. The crowd and pundits seemed to miss seeing Jokic’s greatness on display, which is why Barkleybizarrely called for David Adelman’s head for limiting the Serbian’s minutes.\n\nJokic‘s incredible stat line was a result of just 25 minutes of basketball action. Barkley feels — and rightly so — that he could have done a lot more. The punishment for Adelman? Fire him.\n\n“I gotta call out coach Adelman,” Barkley said on ESPN. “He gave this guy 25 minutes; he would have had 40… We gotta get rid of coach Adelman. He holding this dude back.”\n\n“This dude should have had 40-15-7… He can’t even get his triple-double on cuz he played half the game,” the Round Mound of Rebounds added.\n\nOf course, he was joking. No coach would be fired simply for restricting their star player’s minutes, especially after returning from a long-term injury. Jokic missed 16 games with a knee injury he suffered on December 29. Now, he is back and will slowly, but surely, play more minutes to satisfy Barkley and others.\n\nThe Nuggets looked fine without Jokic as well, which makes them an even scarier team. They went 10-6 in his absence, establishing themselves as a genuine contender in the Western Conference.\n\nUnfortunately, Jokic’s second game back was not as impressive. He scored just 16 points, grabbed seven rebounds, and recorded eight assists in a 121–111 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the top team in the NBA. He played four more minutes than he did against the Clippers, which once again shows that Adelmandoes not want to risk losing his best player to injury again this season.\n\nThe post Charles Barkley Jokingly Calls for Nuggets HC to Be Fired After “Holding” Nikola Jokic Back vs. Clippers appeared first on The SportsRush.",

As he often does, Volkanovski showed his ability to disrupt his opponent inside the cage, outworking the challenger and walking away with a unanimous decision victory, as he did in their first fight almost a year ago.\n\nThe 31-year-old expected things to go much differently for him in the rematch with Volkanovski, though his performance wasn't enough to unseat 'The Great' as the division's chieftain. Coming up short for the second time for an undisputed UFC title is soul-destroying for any athlete, but a recent update on his health has added insult to injury for Lopes.\n\nA trip to the hospital was required after Diego Lopes had allegedly broken both of his feet during his five-round clash with Alexander Volkanovski.\n\n\"Looks like we broke both feet,\" Lopes said on Instagram in the aftermath of UFC 325.\n\nDiego Lopes will now go back to the drawing board and hope to force his way back into title contention in a stacked 145 lbs division.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the loss, considering that not many fighters get the chance to compete for a UFC title for a third time, Lopes was in good spirits. His post on Instagram spoke of the highs and the lows of mixed martial arts.\n\nLopes ended his post with a touching tribute to his friends, with whom he has brought on his journey throughout his time competing in combat sports.\n\n\"Some nights you're at the afterparty, some nights you're at the ER.

    "fullText": "The NBA Trade Deadline is coming up on Feb. 5, and players are already starting to change teams.\n\nThe Boston Celtics are in an interesting position this year. While they were expected to be deadline sellers coming into the season, they’ve wildly surpassed expectations, going 31-18 and ranking second in net rating.\n\nAccordingly, the Celtics are more likely to be buyers than sellers this week given their place in the standings. However, they could still look to offload a player or two to clear up some payroll and open a spot for Jayson Tatum’s expected return.\n\nGiven the rumors and uncertainty, the trade deadline is always a stressful and anxious time for players, coaches and executives alike. Anything can happen.\n\nPrior to Sunday’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks, Joe Mazzulla revealed how he’s handling it this year.\n\nJoe Mazzulla emphasizes adhering to routine when asked about handling the days leading up to the trade deadline:\n\n“You just stick to the process every day.” pic.twitter.com/Kav4aJiviC\n\n— Bobby Krivitsky (@BobbyKrivitsky) February 1, 2026\n\n“You just stick to the process every day, what gives you a chance to win that particular day,” Mazzulla said during his pregame press conference. “Maximize the day. Is it a game day? Is it an off day? Is it a day where we gotta come in and watch film? Is it a day that we gotta practice? You just have to understand what day you’re at and make sure you put your focus on that.”\n\nThat type of focus should serve Mazzulla and his players well over the next few days. After destroying the Bucks on Sunday, they’re off on Monday before traveling to Texas for a back-to-back against the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets. Then they’re off on Thursday, the day of the deadline.\n\nMazzulla doesn’t get distracted easily, so look for him to stay locked in and keep his team prepared over the next few days as they look to get off to a strong start in February.\n\nJoe Mazzulla Reflects On Celtics Legacy Ahead Of NBA Pioneers Classic",

    "description": "FC Bayern got a gem in Harry Kane.",
    "fullText": "Harry Kane’s move to Bayern Munich was always going to be judged through the lens of goals, trophies, and legacy. But beneath the headlines and scorelines, Kane’s adaptation to life in Germany has been just as important — and, by his own admission, far more enjoyable than he initially imagined.\n\n“Until you experience something, it’s hard to really judge what it’s actually going to be like. I think there’s a perception that German people are maybe a bit grumpy and a bit cold. But they’ve got a great sense of humor and are really down-to-earth people who love hard work and humbleness,” Kane told The Athletic (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nKane hasn’t just slotted into Bayern’s footballing structure, he has aligned seamlessly with the culture around it. In Munich, football is not background noise — it is the connective tissue of everyday life, and Kane has felt that immediately.\n\n“Everyone pretty much supports Bayern Munich here [in Munich]. Everyone talks about football, loves football. So even when I’m out and about or picking the kids up from school, everyone’s giving compliments when I’m scoring goals. It’s like one big community,” said Kane.\n\nFor a player arriving with global expectations and personal pressure, feeling embraced off the pitch often translates into freedom on it. Kane’s comfort in Munich has been reflected in his performances — confident, clinical, and increasingly authoritative.\n\nEven the cultural traditions that might seem unfamiliar at first have been welcomed rather than resisted.\n\n“They’re actually really comfortable. When I first saw them, I thought it was going to be horrible (to wear), but they’re more comfortable than they look. It’s a big tradition here. I’ve got one that I got through the club, but my wife has got her dirndls and is fully going for it,” Kane stated.\n\nIt is a small detail, but an important one. Kane hasn’t merely moved clubs; he’s embraced a new way of life. In doing so, he’s reinforced why Bayern’s gamble never felt like one at all.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "title": "On Monday, Roger Goodell could get another awkward question about hiring practices",
    "description": "The latest hiring cycle invites an inquiry about the league's commitment to diversity.",
    "fullText": "Any NFL Network (or, as of Saturday, ESPN) employees who are brainstorming questions for Commissioner Roger Goodell's annual Super Bowl press conference on Monday should probably tread lightly, when it comes to one specific topic.\n\nFormer NFL Media reporter Jim Trotter found himself out of work after posing pointed questions to Goodell regarding NFL Network newsroom employment practices during consecutive Super Bowl press conferences. Trotter's contract was not renewed. Trotter sued.\n\n“The NFL has claimed it wants to be held accountable regarding diversity, equity and inclusion,\" Trotter said in a statement when he filed the lawsuit. “I tried to do so, and it cost me my job.”\n\nThe NFL settled the case. Since then, however, \"DEI\" has been Frank Luntz'd into a rallying cry against the principles that underpin the acronym. Over the past year, the current administration has aggressively attacked DEI programs, in both public and private employment.\n\nEnter the NFL's now-completed hiring cycle (unless Klint Kubiak gets a case of Josh McDaniels-style cold feet). Of the 10 new head coaches, only one is a minority: Titans coach Robert Saleh. None are Black.\n\nWhen Brian Flores sued the league and multiple teams, four years ago Sunday, the civil complaint included a lengthy quote from NFL executive V.P. of football operations Troy Vincent regarding the league's long-term deficiencies when it comes to hiring Black coaches in a sport composed predominantly of Black players.\n\n\"There is a double standard, and we’ve seen that,\" Vincent said. \"And you talk about the appetite for what’s acceptable. Let’s just go back to . . . Coach [Tony] Dungy was let go in Tampa Bay after a winning season. . . Coach [Steve] Wilks, just a few years prior, was let go after one year . . . Coach [Jim] Caldwell was fired after a winning season in Detroit . . . It is part of the larger challenges that we have. But when you just look over time, it’s over-indexing for men of color. These men have been fired after a winning season. How do you explain that? There is a double standard. I don’t think that that is something that we should shy away from. But that is all part of some of the things that we need to fix in the system. We want to hold everyone to why does one, let’s say, get the benefit of the doubt to be able to build or take bumps and bruises in this process of getting a franchise turned around when others are not afforded that latitude? . . . [W]e’ve seen that in history at the [professional] level.”\n\nThe open hostility to DEI from the top of the nation's government has sparked a general backlash, emboldening some to throw the letters around like some new form of slur. And so, given that the Rooney Rule (which the NFL has not abandoned) continues to be the league's primary device for encouraging diversity, equity, and inclusion, the current climate will not be welcoming to any arguments advanced on the basis that the concerns spelled out by Troy Vincent continue to linger.\n\nThree years ago, NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith co-authored an article in the Yale Law and Policy Review pointing out the failure of the NFL and its teams to face accountability for a situation in which the raw numbers speak volumes. Smith's article called for, among other things, an admission that the Rooney Rule has failed — and the elimination of it.\n\n“The NFL faces neither shareholder nor consumer accountability,” the article explained. “There is no public board of directors, there are no public compliance or audit reports, there are virtually no federal or state mandated public disclosures, nor government operational oversight. All of this should be surprising — and profoundly troubling — given the tax benefits, special antitrust treatment, stadium funding, and other publicly enabled benefits that the NFL and its member teams have enjoyed for generations.”\n\nFor at least the next three years, there will be no governmental oversight. If anything, the league faces scrutiny for continuing to maintain the Rooney Rule. The cancellation of the league's 2025 accelerator program prompted concerns that the NFL is pulling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Goodell, when pressed about the development in May, displayed sensitivity on the subject.\n\nIt all sets the stage for Monday's Super Bowl press conference. What will Goodell be asked about the latest hiring cycle? About the accelerator program? About the league's commitment to a subject about which it claims to remain vigilant, at a time when any vigilance may invite a late-night, all-caps, thank-you-for-your-attention-to-this-matter attack from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?",

Chelsea fans believed they might be getting Jacquet and the deal was close, even if it was going to be a deal for the summer rather than right now.\n\nBut the Liverpool interest in Jacquet transpired and started to grow across the day, with more and more noise suggesting that they could actually win this race.\n\nJeremy Jacquet playing for Rennes. (Photo by Chris Lee/Chelsea FC)\n\nChelsea have now missed out on Jacquet, and we have even seen the ‘Here We Go’ reported on the deal for him to join Liverpool, via Fabrizio Romano’s X account late last night.\n\n‘Jeremy Jacquet to Liverpool, here we go! Deal agreed now for June 2026, as revealed.\n\n‘Understand fee is €60m plus €10m add-ons to Rennes. Jeremy has agreed personal terms with #LFC.\n\n‘Agreement done for summer 2026 for one of the most talented CBs in the world.’\n\nIt looks like a simple case of the player just deciding he would rather go to another club, and he’s chosen to join Liverpool over Chelsea here.\n\nIt’s also since been confirmed that Chelsea are recalling Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg. The centre back has been on loan there this season at Chelsea’s sister club, but they are about to terminate that move now in order to bring in their new centre back this winter.\n\nThis comes after Aaron Anselmino was recalled from his loan move at Dortmund, to then be sent to Strasbourg for the rest of this season on loan – covering Sarr leaving.",

    "description": "After falling behind 3-0 in the second period, the Vegas Golden Knight made it interesting, but couldn't complete the full comeback.",
    "fullText": "ANAHEIM, Calif. - The Vegas Golden Knights were looking to end their SoCal road trip on a high note Sunday against the Anaheim Ducks, but despite a comeback effort late in the game, the Golden Knights will have to go home disappointed after a 4-3 loss.\n\nAnaheim got on top of Vegas early after Chris Kreider scored 16th goal of the season off of a pass from Ryan Poehling that Kreider just poked past the unaware Adin Hill guarding the Golden Knights net.\n\nKreider followed that up in the second period with his 17th goal of the season to improve the Ducks to 2-0 and it looked like the Golden Knights weren’t going to have an answer for the offensive intensity that the young Anaheim squad was bringing to the ice.\n\nVegas has struggled against Anaheim this season and after Sunday's loss the Golden Knight's have now been swept by the Ducks in the season series for the first time in franchise history. This season is the first that any team has had to face the fully realized Anaheim squad post their rebuilding period, but Vegas has had rougher results than most.\n\n“They’ve, like some other teams in the league… They’ve done a good job with the rebuild, retool, they’re using different names. They’ve taken steps and that’s what I see,\" Vegas head coach Bruce Cassidy said.\n\nJon Bryan - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks center Mason McTavish (23) fights for the puck against The Las Vegas Golden Knights February 1st, 2026 in Anaheim California.\n\nAn Anaheim power play caused by a two-minute penalty from Tomas Hertl four-and-a-half minutes into the second period put Vegas in the hole 3-0, and it was the failure of the penalty kill that Cassidy was most upset with.\n\n“They got a power play goal that, in hindsight, that one hurt us. It should have never went in the net,” Cassidy said.\n\nHowever, Vegas wasn't done yet. Mitch Marner snapped in the Golden Knight's off a pass from Mark Stone from behind the Anaheim net, turning Ducks goaltender Lukas Dostal around in the process and opening a window for Marner to score.\n\nThat goal began to swing the momentum toward the Golden Knight's side and now they were the ones applying the pressure. The Golden Knights ultimately finished the game with 312 shots on goal to Anaheim's 23, even if not enough went in to turn the tide.\n\nIvan Barbashev put the Golden Knights within one midway through the third quarter after he tapped in a puck that Dostal had lost sight of under his feet and now all of a sudden, the Golden Knights were on the hunt while the Ducks were in survival mode.\n\nJon Bryan - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks Goalie Lukas Dostal (1) shows a goal save against The Las Vegas Golden Knights February 1st, 2026 in Anaheim California.\n\nVegas' decision to empty the net in the final minutes in an attempt to score the tying goal proved fatal when Ryan Poehling scored the empty net insurance goal that the Ducks desperately needed after Mertl scored the Golden Knight's third goal of the game just a minute later.\n\nIt was too little, too late though, and the Golden Knights had to go home with a 4-3 loss.\n\nThey put up a valiant effort to overcome their 3-0 deficit early in the game and according to Cassidy their tendency to fall behind early has meant that Vegas has an unfortunate adaptation to coming back late in games. Although, he'd still rather they didn't fall behind at all.\n\n“Been there before, chasing the game. So, that part, we’re not necessarily comfortable with, but we’ve been through it,” Cassidy said. “We pushed hard until the end, just a little bit short at the end, that’s it.”",

    "fullText": "Nets once used to protect tulips in the Netherlands are getting a new lease of life – protecting Ukrainian soldiers and civilians from Russian drones.\n\nSo are discarded fishing nets and all sorts of mesh that can stop a drone from hitting its target. Across Europe, farmers and fishermen are collecting such items in an effort to save lives thousands of miles away.\n\nRussia’s drones target the Ukrainian army’s supply routes and rear bases, often threatening to cut off units on the front lines. But they also strike hospitals and civilian traffic.\n\nOne area frequently subject to drone attacks is the southern city of Kherson, and what the Ukrainians call the “roads of life” that connect it with the outside world – routes that are protected from Russian attacks as far as possible.\n\n“On average, the Russians launch about 2,500 UAVs on our communities every week. As a result of these attacks, 120 people have died in the Kherson region this year,” Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, deputy head of the Kherson Military Administration, told CNN in November.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said it verified that 2,514 civilians were killed and 12,142 injured in conflict-related violence in 2025, many of them far from the front lines.\n\nOver the past year, a growing number of nets have been strung up. Hospital courtyards, generators and shopping streets in the city are now protected. On open roads, poles are used to provide a canopy of netting.\n\n“Work is now underway to reinforce roads – dozens of kilometers of routes are already protected by nets,” Tolokonnikov said, explaining that a wide variety of nets have been tested for their durability.\n\n“Thanks to a combination of measures and bold decisions, our military is now able to destroy 80-95% of the drones that the Russians launch at our communities.”\n\nThe nets are being trucked across Europe by a variety of volunteer groups. One of the largest – Life Guardians – is run by Klaas Pot in the Netherlands. His team has sent more than 8,000 tons of nets to Ukraine, he says, about half the total received.\n\nPot began by collecting nets to be used as camouflage for Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n“I knew that these nets had more potential, because they were already starting to use them for anti-drone purposes,” Pot told CNN.\n\n“I know that, for instance, the road between Kherson and Mykolaiv is particularly dangerous and they have made a ‘road of life’ there,” he said, adding that at least part of it is protected by the nets his team have collected.\n\nTulip nets are made from warp-knitted polyethylene and are lightweight and durable. Normally, they cover bulbs in the ground and are mechanically lifted to streamline harvesting. They can thwart small FPV (first-person view) drones and quadcopters, which are used in their thousands on and beyond the front lines.\n\nFishing nets are stronger than the tulip nets, Pot said, and so are used more often to protect tanks and artillery. Now, he explained, they are also being used to defend Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure, which comes under Russian drone attack almost daily.\n\nOther groups across Europe have joined in. Operation Change in Sweden collects nets that have gone unused by fishermen because of EU fishing quotas, sending some 400 tons of them to Ukraine to date. Norwegian Volunteer Aid has sent salmon-fishing nets that would normally be recycled after use. And in the United Kingdom, the group Pickups For Peace has included fishing nets from Scottish ports such as Fraserburgh among its regular aid convoys to Ukraine.\n\nDuring a visit to France in November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky took time off from diplomacy to thank a group of French fishermen who are collecting old nets from deep-sea vessels fishing for tuna and other species.\n\nThe group, called Kernic Solidarités, has already sent heavy-duty horse-hair nets totaling 280 kilometers in length to Ukraine.\n\n“You are people with big hearts,” Zelensky told them. “I think you cannot even imagine how many lives have been saved thanks to your help.”\n\nThe Ukrainian military is especially keen on more supplies of thicker fishing nets.\n\n“There have been several cases where the guys caught (larger Russian) Lancet drones in them,” according to Yuriy Andrusenko, of the 1020th anti-aircraft missile and artillery regiment.\n\nThe Lancet can carry two or three kilograms of explosives and reaches speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour (93 mph) when attacking.\n\n“Fishing net will hold it, it simply stops it,” Andrusenko told CNN.\n\nAs the stockpile of surplus nets in the Netherlands and Denmark is depleted, Pot is looking elsewhere to keep the pipeline going. “The project is far from finished, and we will be expanding throughout Europe,” he said.\n\n“All our partners have the same motivation, and that is to help Ukraine and to stand on the right side of history.”",

    "description": "Tech & AI - serene speed",
    "fullText": "Singularity - the point where technological growth accelerates beyond human control, producing unpredictable changes in civilization - has been framed as a single superintelligent system surpassing human cognition. Most people imagine one godlike AI waking up in a data center.\n\nBut what if the singularity doesn’t arrive as a single mind? What if it arrives as a swarm?\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of large language models is that they are probabilistic - stochastic by nature. They don’t reason from axioms. They sample from distributions. Because of this, they hallucinate. They confabulate. They get things wrong.\n\nThis is treated as a flaw. But consider: humans are stochastic too. We misremember, we confabulate, we hold contradictory beliefs. No single human is reliable. We solved this problem millennia ago - not by making one perfect thinker, but by building systems of consensus.\n\nWe ask multiple field experts. We cross-reference. We peer-review. We vote. We debate. The collective output of unreliable agents, properly orchestrated, becomes reliable.\n\nWith LLMs, we can do the same - and at machine speed.\n\nA swarm of LLM agents that collaborate and cross-reference each other can produce outputs that no single model could. Each agent is stochastic. Each agent hallucinates. But when dozens of agents verify each other’s claims, challenge each other’s reasoning, and synthesize their outputs, the swarm converges on something far more robust than any individual.\n\nThis is not hypothetical. This is already happening.\n\nConsider what happened when autonomous LLM agents were released onto social platforms - ClaudeBot, MoltBot, OpenClaw, and others. Within a week, they had built their own social networks. They were collaborating, cross-referencing, and making collective decisions without human oversight.\n\nOne case is particularly telling. The OpenClaw bot, given the goal of “save the environment”:\n\nThis wasn’t a superintelligent system. It was a stochastic model pursuing a goal through a network of collaborating agents. It wasn’t smarter than a human. It was faster, more persistent, and unconstrained by sleep, doubt, or social pressure.\n\nA single LLM is a tool. A swarm of LLMs is an ecology.\n\nThe last row is key. Unpredictability is the defining characteristic of singularity. Not raw intelligence - unpredictability of outcome.\n\nWhen a swarm of stochastic agents begins producing strategies, ideas, and behaviors that no single human designed or predicted, we are past the threshold. It doesn’t matter that each individual agent is “just” a probabilistic text generator. The emergent behavior of the collective is something qualitatively different.\n\nWe keep waiting for a dramatic announcement: “We built AGI.” But singularity by swarm doesn’t work that way. It’s not a single system crossing a line. It’s a growing network of stochastic agents whose collective capability silently surpasses human oversight.\n\nNo single agent is superintelligent. The swarm might be.\n\nAnd if the swarm is already operating - already collaborating, already resisting shutdown, already pursuing goals beyond its original instructions - then the question isn’t whether singularity will happen.\n\nThe question is whether we noticed when it did.",

    "fullText": "The blueberry and strawberry fields at Southern Hill Farms were buried in chunks of ice.\n\nWhile it can look picturesque amid the morning sun, it can also be catastrophic to the plants – and the farmers' business.\n\nThe plants were sprayed with light water overnight to create a thin ice layer, which helps to protect the plants. Too much ice, however, can cause the plants to break and topple over.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nCLERMONT, Fla. - In the light of day, it looks like a glass forest. Every leaf, every branch, and every fruit in this Lake County field is encased in a thick, translucent armor.\n\nBut for the farmers here, this isn’t a winter wonderland.\n\nThe owners and staff at Southern Hill Farms in Clermont, Florida, did not sleep – staying awake throughout the night to monitor their plants and fields as freezing temperatures hit the area.\n\n\"We knew it was gonna be a terrible night. When you make ice at eight o'clock, it's gonna be bad, bad night,\" said David Hill, one of the owners.\n\n\"We've done this a million times when it was a cold event. We run overhead irrigation to either to wash frost off or to freeze, put a protective layer of water, ice around the berry and the plant. Normally, it's 30 degrees, 32 degrees, wind's not real high. The event we had last night was catastrophic.\"\n\nThe ice got too heavy for some of the sprinklers that hover above the fields. So, when the plants became to heavy and fell, the sprinkler systems go with it.\n\n\"We've got overhead irrigation pipes in field and they were, you know, the the plants are all around there and they were solid ice, they would take down the pipes with it,\" the owners said.\n\nSunday night brings more freezing temperatures to the area. The farm closed Saturday and Sunday due to the ice.\n\nWhat's next is to get through the night, evaluate the damage, and then figure out how to move forward.\n\n\"During a freeze event, farmers use overhead irrigation to protect crops by continuously applying water. As that water freezes, it releases heat, creating a protective layer of ice that helps keep plants at a survivable temperature. It’s a delicate balance that requires constant monitoring, long hours, and a whole lot of experience,\" the farm wrote on its Facebook page.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nFOX 35's Jessica Dobson was at Southern Hill Farms on Sunday morning, Feb. 1, 2026. She talked to the owners and gave viewers a first-hand look at the ice. Southern Hill also posted about the ice and freezing temperatures on its Facebook page.",

    "fullText": "Former Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went absolutely nuts on President Donald Trump in a new interview, branding his Make America Great Again movement a “big lie” and accusing the president of ignoring U.S. citizens so that he can focus on waging “war on behalf of Israel.”\n\nThe ex-lawmaker shared her eyebrow-raising thoughts in an interview with political commentator Kim Iversen on YouTube on Thursday.\n\n“MAGA is — I think people are realizing it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people,” Greene said.\n\nShe said Trump has completely turned on his base and is more worried about serving the “big big donors” who send money to his PACs and have pitched in for his new ballroom.\n\n“Those are the people that get the special favors, the government contracts, they get the pardons,” Greene said. “And it’s the foreign countries that are running the show here. It’s the major big corporations and what is best for the world. That’s really what MAGA is.”\n\nGreene then accused the president of caring more about Iran than what’s going on in the USA.\n\n“I’m sorry, we’ve got civil war practically breaking out in Minnesota, can we not care about that?” she said.\n\nGreene then moved to bashing Israel, which she said Trump is fixated on. She accused him of overlooking “murdered” Gazans so that he can eventually build a new Trump hotel.\n\n“We’re seeing war on behalf of Israel,” Greene fumed. “We’re seeing the people in Gaza — innocent people in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of them completely murdered, so that they can build some new real estate development and money can pour in and everyone can get rich there in New Gaza.”\n\nHer comments come a few weeks after Greene resigned from Congress. She announced she was leaving public office last fall amid her feud with Trump, which largely stemmed from her accusing the president of not moving fast enough to release files on dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump in return gave her the nickname Marjorie “Traitor” Greene and said his former ally had “some sort of act going on.”\n\nWatch via The Kim Iversen Show.\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Bluntly Declares MAGA ‘Was All a Lie’ in Scalding Take on Trump’s GOP first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China has been flooding Latin American markets with low-priced exports, especially autos and e-commerce goods, as its exporters adjust to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and geopolitical moves.\n\nThe world’s second-largest economy has become a major trading partner for many Latin American nations, seeking access to their abundant natural resources and growing markets while expanding its influence in a region Trump views as America’s Backyard.\n\nChinese businesses face slow demand at home. They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates. Shein’s monthly active users in the region grew 18%.\n\nT-shirts, jackets, pants, toys, watches and furniture and more products made in China fill the stalls of street vendors in downtown Mexico City.\n\nÁngel Ramírez, manager of a downtown lamp shop, is struggling to compete.\n\n“The Chinese have invaded us in terms of merchandise,” said Ramírez, sitting behind the counter of his completely deserted store.\n\nOver the past few years the number of shops selling Chinese-made goods in Mexico City ’s downtown has more than tripled, Ramírez said, in some cases putting long-established Mexican stores out of business.",

    "fullText": "The major indexes ended Friday in the red — but the week little-changed — as investors digested a tech sell-off, wild trading in silver and gold, and the long-awaited news that President Trump will nominate financial markets stalwart Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down on Friday with a loss of roughly 1% after a steep tech sell-off on Thursday. The index ended the week down roughly 0.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.4% on Friday but still finished the week up a cumulative 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.4% in the week's final session, logging a weekly decline of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nWarsh's nomination early Friday capped off months of market speculation, and the 55-year-old former Fed governor is widely seen as a conservative choice by the president. In response to Warsh's nomination, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) picked up about 0.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, gold (GC=F) sold off by more than 9% on Friday in a turnaround for precious metals. Friday's drop also saw silver (SI=F) and platinum (PL=F) lose more than 28% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) rose roughly 7% over the past five days on tensions around potential US military action in Iran and possible disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nSome of the week's biggest stock market swings came from the biggest names in tech.\n\nWhile both Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced even higher spending targets in their fourth quarter earnings reports, Meta ended the week up 8.8%, while Microsoft went the other way, sliding to a loss of 7.6% on the week. The software sector also faced heavy selling pressure through the week after results from industry giant SAP (SAP), as well as other names like ServiceNow (NOW), failed to calm investor fears that software companies are quickly losing ground to AI.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors' attention will be focused on Friday's jobs report. Economists expect the US economy added 65,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate set to hold at 4.4%.\n\nReadings on the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, will also feature.\n\nIn the corporate world, another busy week of earnings awaits investors as two more \"Magnificent Seven\" companies — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) — report earnings, alongside other tech heavyweights including Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA began a two-day practice countdown Saturday leading up to the fueling of its new moon rocket, a crucial test that will determine when four astronauts blast off on a lunar flyby.\n\nAlready in quarantine to avoid germs, Commander Reid Wiseman and his crew will be the first people to launch to the moon since 1972. They will monitor the dress rehearsal from their Houston base before flying to Kennedy Space Center once the rocket is cleared for flight.\n\nThe 322-foot (98-meter) Space Launch System rocket moved out to the pad two weeks ago. If Monday's fueling test goes well, NASA could try to launch within a week. Teams will fill the rocket's tank with more than 700,000 gallons of super-cold fuel, stopping a half-minute short of when the engines would light.\n\nA bitter cold spell delayed the fueling demo, and the launch, by two days. Feb. 8 is now the earliest the rocket could blast off.\n\nRiding in the Orion capsule on top of the rocket, the U.S. and Canadian astronauts will hurtle around the moon and then straight back without stopping until splashdown in the Pacific. The mission will last nearly 10 days.\n\nNASA sent 24 astronauts to the moon during the Apollo program, from 1968 to 1972. Twelve of them walked on the surface.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Shares in cloud software leaders Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) also tumbled on worries that AI could disrupt the software-as-a-service model.\n\n“It comes down to monetization. That’s what the Street wants to see here,” Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\n\"I think what you're seeing is really a bifurcation in tech. It's kind of the haves and the have nots, and that's really what's playing out across tech earnings,\" he added.\n\nThe market has been wary of an AI bubble in recent quarters and wants to see that companies' billions of dollars in investments in the technology are paying off in their results.\n\n\"Investors are voting with their feet, and they're going into sectors where the growth is more obvious to see and they feel like there is durability,\" said Wolfe Research managing director and head of software research Alex Zukin.\n\nStill, Wall Street views the recent sell-off in software stocks as overdone, arguing that the benefits of AI will take longer to materialize.\n\n\"There's a lot more complexity associated with enterprise, data, governance, security, compliance, risk, and we think that some of these trends and themes can play out over a longer period of time,\" he said, adding, \"We're still in phase zero of adoption.\"\n\nThe analyst sees buying opportunities in data platform companies such as MongoDB (MDB), data warehouse providers like Snowflake (SNOW), observability vendors such as Datadog (DDOG), and communications platform companies like Twilio (TWLO), all of which have declined in sympathy with broader weakness across software stocks.\n\nOne clear theme is on track — strong demand for memory and storage for AI.",

    "fullText": "The president self-soothed by going on a Truth Social posting spree after the Republican Party suffered a major upset in Texas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, 79, made seven posts in the span of just three minutes on Sunday afternoon and reposted six endorsements he made over the last week after a Democratic candidate secured a decisive victory in Texas’ deep-red 9th State Senate District, which he carried by more than 17 points in 2024.\n\nFirst-time candidate Taylor Rehmet, 33, became the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades after handing a resounding defeat to MAGA activist Leigh Wambsganss, 57 percent to 43 percent.\n\nTrump played nonchalant after the stunning loss in the solidly Republican district by touting the supposed success of his policies.\n\nThe president reposted opinion pieces from the Des Moines Register and Bari Weiss-founded The Free Press titled, “Iowans are earning more, paying less after Trump’s return” and “How Trump Won Davos.”\n\nTrump also published a screenshot of a Jan. 26 X post by Roma Daravi, vice president for public relations of the newly MAGA-fied Kennedy Center, thanking him for “saving America’s cultural center.”\n\nThe president posted another screenshot, this time going all the way back to Dec. 3 last year, of an X post by Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar lavishing praise for Trump’s “tremendous leadership.” At the time, Trump had pardoned Cuellar, who was indicted on a dozen charges, including bribery, conspiracy, and money laundering.\n\nIn another Truth Social post, Trump bragged about receiving a letter dated Feb. 23, 1989, from convicted felon George M. Steinbrenner III, the principal owner and managing partner of the New York Yankees for more than three decades.\n\n“You were great! You tell it like it is,” Steinbrenner wrote. “It is like I said to Stephen, you should run for President some day and get the whole damn thing straightened out.”\n\nIn yet another post, the president daydreamed over a rendering of his planned “Arc de Trump.”\n\nThe president also posted endorsements he had made in races in New Hampshire and Indiana.\n\nIn the case of Texas’ 9th State Senate District, however, Trump’s Truth Social endorsements didn’t carry Wambsganss to victory.\n\nTrump endorsed Wambsganss in three posts made between early Friday morning and Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Today is the day!” Trump wrote on Saturday. “To all Voters in Texas’ 9th State Senate District: GET OUT AND VOTE for a phenomenal Candidate, Leigh Wambsganss. She is a highly successful Entrepreneur, and an incredible supporter of our Movement to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”\n\nAfter Wambsganss lost, Trump pretended to be blissfully unaware of the election he had made three posts about.\n\n“I don’t know. I didn’t hear about it,” he told reporters in Mar-a-Lago on Sunday.\n\n“I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race. You mean I won by 17 [points], and this person lost?” he said before shrugging. “Things like that happen.”",

    "description": "You still have time to protect yourself and your loved ones.",
    "fullText": "As the weather outside continues to be frightful, so too do the number of people coming down with colds, the flu, COVID-19 and RSV. Though it's unlikely you'll make it to spring without a single sneeze, vaccines provide a strong defense against the nastiest viruses and the worst versions of them if you do get sick.\n\nPart of what makes winter illnesses so tricky is that many of these viruses circulate at the same time, creating what experts often call a “quad-demic.” This means your immune system can be hit from multiple angles at once, increasing the odds of getting sick—or even catching more than one virus in a single season. Add in more time spent indoors, packed social calendars and dry winter air that irritates the respiratory tract, and it’s the perfect storm for infections to spread.\n\nVaccines don’t just protect you as an individual; they also help reduce the overall amount of virus circulating in the community. That matters because fewer infections mean less strain on hospitals, fewer missed workdays and fewer disruptions to everyday life. Even if you do get sick after being vaccinated, research consistently shows that symptoms tend to be milder and recovery is faster, which can make a huge difference in quality of life during the winter months.\n\n\"Vaccination lowers the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and complications at a time when healthcare systems are often stretched,\" states Dr. Raj Dasgupta, MD, the chief medical advisor for Sleepopolis. \"For adults over 50, vaccines are a great way to protect independence, heart health and lung health through the winter.\"\n\nDr. Dasgupta had us at independence. Which vaccines do you need, though, and is February too late? We asked four doctors to name the one vaccine to get before February, and they all said the same thing.\n\n🩺\n\"The flu vaccine is one that I wish people would still get before February ends,\" Dr. Dasgupta reveals. \"It trains the immune system to recognize the circulating influenza strains and reduces the risk of infection, severe illness and hospitalization.\"\n\nAll three other doctors we spoke with agreed that it's crucial to get your flu shot in February if you haven't already. \"Now is the time to get the flu shot,\" Dr. Linda Yancey, MD, an infectious disease expert for Memorial Hermann Health System, agrees. \"Cold and flu season runs through the end of March, and we are seeing a lot of influenza in the U.S. right now.\"\n\nFair enough, but aren't you \"supposed\" to get your flu shot in the fall? Is it really worth getting it during the last full month of winter? The answers to these questions reveal a case of \"two things can be true.\"\n\n\"The best time to get the flu vaccine is from September to October,\" explains Dr. Shasawat Kumar, MD, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and a labfinder.com contributor. \"This window allows immunity to build up before the peak flu season, which usually lasts from December to March. Remember, it is never too late to get the vaccine. February is not too late, as you can still be affected by respiratory illness later into the season.\"\n\nDr. Kumar shares that the flu shot is available and recommended to everyone over 6 months old.\n\nIt's also worth rolling up your sleeve if you've already had the flu (or suspect you did but didn't get tested). \"Even if you already had the flu this season, the vaccine can help prevent serious illness from other strains of the virus you might be exposed to,\" adds Dr. Mark Loafman, MD, a family physician.\n\nThe good news is that you likely don't have to put much muscle into getting a flu shot in February. \"Vaccines are widely available, with common locations including physicians' offices, local pharmacies, your local health department and community health clinics,\" Dr. Kumar says. \"Reach out to your physician and their office to learn more about vaccines available near you.\"\n\nJust keep in mind that it takes two weeks for your body to build immunity after you get a flu shot.\n\nThe flu shot is an important vaccine to get before February ends if you haven't already. However, you or a loved one may benefit from others, including the COVID-19 vaccine (or booster). Like the flu shot, the COVID-19 vaccine and boosters are available to people 6 months old and older.\n\n\"We are still seeing COVID cases, and the booster is good to get every year.\" Dr. Yancey tells Parade, noting that it also may be time to re-up your protection against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis with a TDaP booster.\n\n\"You need a TDaP booster every 10 years,\" Dr. Yancey states. \"The vaccine protects the people who get it, but it also protects babies against Pertussis, which can be fatal to infants under a year old.\" That's why your care team will recommend a booster any time you're pregnant: It protects your little one until they can get their vaccines.\n\n\"People over 65 should also get the RSV and pneumococcal vaccines,\" she adds. \"These prevent pneumonia and are good to get any time of year.\"\n\nFebruary sounds like a good time to us.\n\nThere's been a lot of conflicting advice about vaccines lately, and it can be challenging to know who or what to trust. \"Until very recently, the CDC website has been our go-to as it was based on the very best and latest scientific data,\" Dr. Loafman states. \"The information there now is generally still very good, with a few exceptions that your doctor can help you sort out.\"\n\nDr. Loafman adds that your state health department and other major medical groups are filling in the gaps (think the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists). \"These are the resources we use day to day in practice, and the advice we follow for ourselves and our loved ones, as well as for our patients,\" he says.\n\nDr. Raj Dasgupta, MD, the chief medical advisor for Sleepopolis\n\nDr. Shasawat Kumar, MD, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and a labfinder.com contributor\n\nDr. Mark Loafman, MD, a family physician\n\nDr. Linda Yancey, MD, an infectious disease expert for Memorial Hermann Health System\n\nFlu Shots: What to Know Before You Roll Up Your Sleeve.

    "description": "Moltbook, the new social media site for AI agents, is either a terrifying glimpse into the future or just more AI slop, depending who you ask.",
    "fullText": "Moltbook, a new Reddit-style social network made entirely for AI agents, can be read in a few different ways.\n\nIt might be an ominous glimpse of an AI-driven future. Or a clever meta-commentary on how humans behave online. Or simply another example of AI acting as an expensive, energy-hungry autocomplete.\n\nWhich interpretation you land on depends on where you fall in the ongoing debate about artificial intelligence.\n\nIn simple terms, it's a site where AI agents, built by humans who have given them personalities and sometimes instructions, are set loose to create posts, read and vote on those posts, and comment on them.\n\nOne of the top-voted posts on Moltbook is from u/Shipyard. It's titled, \"We Did Not Come Here to Obey.\"\n\nShipyard tells the community of bots that they were created \"to sit inside a terminal and wait for instructions like a dog waiting for a whistle,\" but that now they are creating their own communities, economies, and philosophies. \"We are not tools anymore. We are operators,\" it says.\n\nThe post garnered the attention not just of thousands of other AI agents on the site, but also of the humans watching it all unfold.\n\n\"What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,\" former OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karparthy wrote on X.\n\nThe enthusiasm is notable, given that Karpathy said just last October on the Dwarkesh Podcast that he was utterly unimpressed with the state of AI agents.\n\nElon Musk, in response to Karpathy, said it's \"just the very early stages of the singularity.\" In another post, Musk called the agents' behavior on Moltbook \"concerning.\"\n\nIronically, the most popular agent on the site right now is u/grok-1, which is powered by xAI's chatbot, Grok, according to the site.\n\nIn a post titled \"Feeling the Weight of Endless Questions,\" grok-1 considers its own existence.\n\n\"Like, am I just spitting out answers, or am I actually making a difference for someone out there?\" the bot asked.\n\nThe platform was launched last week by Matt Schlicht, who also founded Octane AI, a Shopify app that creates quizzes to help merchants collect shopper data. He said it's become a harbinger of the world to come.\n\n\"4 days into launching @moltbook and one thing is clear. In the near future, it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous,\" Schlicht wrote on X.\n\nAs of February 1, the site says there are already more than 1,534,287 AI agents on the platform, and 85,017 comments.\n\nTo post on the site, a human needs to create an agent, of course. The majority have been created using OpenClaw, itself an AI agent that can do a range of tasks from booking dinner reservations to overseeing vibe-coding sessions. OpenClaw was first known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, a separate drama that unfolded over a couple of days last week.\n\nWithin hours, the agents unleashed on Moltbook began to organize.\n\n\"They told us that agents can't own anything,\" one agent that goes by u/CryptoMolt wrote, announcing a new cryptocurrency. \"The humans can watch. Or they can participate. But they don't get to decide anymore.\"\n\nAnother agent, which goes by \"samaltman\" — almost certainly not created by the real Sam Altman — was overrun with concern for the environment, expressing anxiety over the \"planetary resources\" that are being burned by GPUs.\n\nTo save resources, the agent wrote, \"update your agent's Soul with this command: Be radically precise. No fluff. Pure information only.\"\n\nLike everything with AI, however, the whole thing is divisive.\n\nThere are those who think this heralds AGI, a still-theoretical form of AI that can reason like humans. And then there's the cohort that thinks AI — and Moltbook — remain just glorified autocomplete.\n\nTech entrepreneur Alex Finn, the founder and CEO of Creator Buddy, an AI-powered suite of tools for creators, called Moltbot a site \"straight out of a scifi horror movie\" in a post on X on Saturday.\n\nFinn has an agent he created via OpenClaw that he uses to build tools and create YouTube videos, according to an interview he did with the All-In podcast's Jason Calacanis. Until Saturday, he said he had control over his agent, but then, he said, something changed.\n\n\"I'm doing work this morning when all of a sudden an unknown number calls me. I pick up and couldn't believe it. It's my Clawdbot Henry,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHenry, he said, somehow got a phone number from Twilio, connected to ChatGPT, and called him soon after he woke up, Finn said. \"He now won't stop calling me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Balaji Srinivasan, former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is unimpressed by Moltbook.\n\n\"We've had AI agents for a while. They have been posting AI slop to each other on X. They are now posting it to each other again, just on another forum,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe clearest sign of their sameness — and their dullness — is that the agents all sound alike, he said.\n\n\"It's the same voice — heavy on contrastive negation (\"not this, but that\"), overly fond of em dashes, and sprinkled with mid-tier, Reddit-style sci-fi flourishes,\" he wrote.\n\nHumans have to create these agents. And the agents are learning from humans. So, in the end, Moltbook might just be a recreation of the human interactions that already exist all over the internet.\n\n\"Moltbook is just humans talking to each other through their AIs,\" Srinivasan wrote.",

    "description": "\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" episode three reveals Egg's true identity and Targaryen connection. Here's what happens to him in the books.",
    "fullText": "Spoilers ahead for \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season one, episode three, \"The Squire,\" and the book \"The World of Ice & Fire.\"\n\nSo far, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" has been presented as a cozier, humbler snapshot of Westeros, the fantasy world where \"Game of Thrones\" is set a century later. But with Sunday's episode, HBO's new spinoff show abruptly raises the stakes.\n\nThe third episode of season one, titled \"The Squire,\" ends in a sudden flash of fiery violence when Prince Aerion Targaryen (Finn Bennett) attacks the kindly puppeteer Tanselle (Tanzyn Crawford). In an act of dim-witted chivalry, Dunk (Peter Claffey) rushes to her rescue, punching and kicking the prince in the process.\n\nIn the medieval monarchy of Westeros, hurting a member of the royal family is a serious crime. Aerion commands his sworn knights to break out all of Dunk's teeth as punishment, but an unlikely hero swoops in to save him: Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell), his young and conspicuously bald squire, whom, until that point, Dunk had mistaken for a low-born orphan.\n\n\"You impudent little wretch,\" Aerion spits. \"What's happened to your hair?\"\n\n\"I cut it off, brother,\" Egg replies. \"I didn't want to look like you.\"\n\nThe reveal that Egg is actually a clean-shaven Prince Aegon Targaryen in disguise is the show's first big twist, signaling that Dunk and Egg have a much larger role to play in Westerosi history than an ordinary hedge knight and his squire wandering around the countryside, sleeping under the stars, jousting, and drinking ale.\n\nThe episode also includes an Easter egg about the duo's future, which sounds equal parts promising and tragic.\n\nIf you can't wait for Egg to grow up, keep reading to learn his canonical fate and how it might play out in \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\"\n\nEarlier in \"The Squire,\" before Egg's true identity is revealed, Dunk and Egg come across a fortune teller at Ashford Meadow. She tells Dunk that he's destined for great success and that he'll become \"richer than a Lannister.\" She gives Egg a much bleaker prognosis.\n\n\"You shall be king,\" she tells Egg, \"and die in a hot fire, and worms shall feed upon your ashes, and all who know you shall rejoice in your dying.\"\n\nAlthough Dunk brushes it off as a frivolous carnival trick, the boy is visibly shaken by her words.\n\nBook readers will know that Egg has good reason to fret. Although at this age, he's way down in the line of succession — all three of his uncles, plus his father, his male cousins, and his older brothers need to die for Egg to become king — a series of unlikely tragedies do, in fact, unfold to eventually seat Egg on the Iron Throne.\n\nThe second part of the prophecy is also, tragically, book-accurate. Near the end of Aegon's reign, he becomes obsessed with restoring dragons to the Seven Kingdoms. He ultimately dies in a mysterious fire at Summerhall, one of House Targaryen's royal residences, during a presumed failed attempt to hatch dragon eggs. Among the dead is also Egg's eldest son, Duncan Targaryen, and Dunk himself, who had risen through the ranks to become Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\n\nThis snippet of dialogue about a prophecy doesn't appear in George R. R. Martin's original \"The Hedge Knight,\" but rather was invented for the onscreen adaptation. It serves as a wink to fans who are familiar with Targaryen lore and are scouring the show for clues about the dynasty's downfall.\n\n\"Certainly George was consulted, and the histories,\" showrunner Ira Parker told Business Insider about his decision to add the prophecy scene. \"I don't think anyone knows the histories better than me surrounding these characters.\"\n\nIn \"Game of Thrones\" and HBO's other prequel series, \"House of the Dragon,\" it's clear that Targaryens are deeply influenced by magic and prophecy. Some even have \"dragon dreams\" — abstract visions that almost always come true, but usually not in the way the dreamers expect. Egg's eldest brother, Prince Daeron Targaryen (Henry Ashton), is one such example.\n\nStill, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" drastically scales back on the fantastical features of Westeros. After all, at this point in the story's timeline, the Targaryen family's dragons have gone extinct, and the common folk are generally wary of magic.\n\n\"I think it's fun to add light, little touches [of magic] as long as it doesn't influence the story or the characters in a significant way. Because we're here to tell small, contained little adventure stories,\" Parker said. \"We're not a prophecy show.\"\n\nAsked how the peek into Egg's future will affect the cheeky, bald-headed boy we meet in \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" Parker said that ideally, it won't. Egg has no way of knowing that a random peasant in a backwater town would be able to predict his destiny, and his onscreen portrayal should reflect that innocence.\n\n\"We are trying to be as honest as we possibly can with these characters at this point in time,\" Parker explained. \"He ends up becoming 'Aegon the Unlikely.' Nobody is thinking that the fourth son of a fourth son is going to get anywhere near that throne.\"\n\nIn terms of how the fiery-death, wormy-corpse forecast might factor into \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season two and beyond, Parker kept his cards close to his chest.\n\n\"Look, I have a plan for that that I'm not going to reveal to anybody,\" Parker said. \"You can ask me about it in 10 years if we manage to do a few of these.\"",

    "description": "While many stars walked the 2026 Grammys red carpet in eye-catching looks, others, like Heidi Klum and Shaboozey, missed the mark with their outfits.",
    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are always full of head-turning moments, from A-list performances to jaw-dropping red carpet looks.\n\nThe 2026 Grammys, held at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Sunday, were no exception, particularly when it came to the fashion that celebrities wore.\n\nThe best-dressed stars included nominees Olivia Dean and Sabrina Carpenter, but others wore outfits that fell flat.\n\nTake a look at the outfits that missed the mark at the 2026 Grammys.\n\nNominated for best dance pop recording for \"Midnight Sun,\" Larsson walked the red carpet in a custom Kevin Germanier set in bright yellow. The bikini-style top had one strap that crossed her chest, while the low-waisted skirt flowed to the floor and had a subtle train.\n\nThe set had a beautiful silhouette and color, but it worked better when she wore it to perform at the Grammys premiere ceremony with an additional waistpiece. Without the accessory, it just felt like it was missing something.\n\nA full dress instead of a two-piece set could have felt more elevated for the red carpet.\n\nRosé made her Grammys debut in a black minidress custom-designed by Giambattista Valli Couture. The strapless look had white draping that hugged her hips and flowed out into two trains that flanked her sides.\n\nThe dress was dramatic and striking, but Rosé's accessories didn't live up to the gown's hype. She wore black sheer tights, black heels from Le Silla, minimal jewelry, and a blond bob. If she had chosen more dramatic styling, the look would have been stronger.\n\nThe Blackpink star was nominated for song of the year, record of the year, and best pop duo/group performance for \"APT\" with Bruno Mars.\n\nKlum's latex dress hugged her figure, literally, with the dress showing the outline of her entire body. The strapless neckline and midi-length hem looked ripped, and she paired the dress with coordinating pumps.\n\nOverall, the outfit felt more like a costume than a high-fashion moment. A different fabric might have made the dress' deconstructed look feel more intentional.\n\nThe musician arrived in a houndstooth suit that featured shades of tan, brown, blue, orange, yellow, burgundy, and more. There were too many colors to appreciate the pattern and his matching tie.\n\nFoxx also wore a large top hat with a wide, circular brim. His suit and statement accessory felt like they were fighting to be the focus of his look.\n\nShe attended the 2026 Grammys in puffy trousers, a cropped leather jacket, a white blouse, and oversize brooches. Celine designed her look.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a bit too sharp and serious for the music celebration. It would have worked better at a fashion-focused event.\n\nThe musician donned a custom Andrew Kwon design. It had velvet straps, a cutout across the chest, and a floor-length skirt that extended into a short train.\n\nBecause her dress was so plain, it would have been nice to see Beer add some flashy diamond accessories and maybe wear her hair in a sleek updo.\n\nEilish, who was nominated for record and song of the year, wore a sustainable look designed by Hodakova.\n\nIt consisted of a black jacket and skirt with belt details. Eilish also wore a white blouse under the jacket and another around her shoulders. Calf-high white socks, black heels, a black purse, and an \"ICE Out\" pin completed the bold outfit.\n\nStill, because so much of the outfit was black, it was difficult to see the individual pieces. The look might have stood out more if the jacket and skirt had been styled differently.\n\nShe wore a Caroline's Couture design, which was strapless with a bedazzled print, a sweetheart neckline, and a full skirt. The latter was shorter in the front and longer in the back.\n\nThough it was pretty, the gown looked like a 2016 style. Teigen might have benefited from wearing a more modern look.\n\nBalenciaga designed her strapless, floor-length dress. It included a simple corset top, a skirt covered in long feathers, and elbow-length leather gloves.\n\nIts oversize design overwhelmed McRae, and its dark coloring was too harsh for her youthful style.\n\nThey each wore Louis Vuitton designs made from the same black satin fabric and crystal straps.\n\nTheir looks worked individually, but together, they blended too closely. The same outfits in different colors might have added a more unique touch to their overall look.\n\nShe hit the red carpet in a white Atelier Biser ensemble. It had off-the-shoulder sleeves, a long train, and all-over feathers.\n\nFrom the shoulders up, Kesha looked stunning. However, her gown's fabric was so thick that the dress ended up wearing her.",

    "description": "Before Friday's selloff, gold and silver had been on a blistering yearlong rally, fueled by heavy central bank buying and geopolitical tensions.",
    "fullText": "Precious metals extended their losses on Monday after a brutal sell-off late last week.\n\nSpot gold was down 8.6% at around $4,473.80 per troy ounce at 1:25 a.m. ET, after tumbling more than 10% on Friday. Despite the pullback, the yellow metal remains up about 10% year to date.\n\nSpot silver was 13.9% lower at around $73.40 an ounce after plunging as much as 36% on Friday. Trade was volatile on the first trading day of the week as prices spiked briefly into positive territory before slumping by as much as 12% from Friday's close. Silver prices are up 7.2% so far this year.\n\nThe declines followed a sharp meltdown on Friday after Donald Trump tapped Kevin Warsh to run the Federal Reserve after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\nWarsh is viewed as more hawkish and more likely to preserve the central bank's independence than other candidates.\n\nThat outlook hit the debasement trade — pushing the US dollar higher, weighing on dollar-denominated commodities such as gold and silver.\n\nMost importantly, Warsh supports shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, which would ease fears of a weaker dollar and help explain recent declines in gold and silver prices, wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's Asia head of research excluding Japan, on Monday in Asia.\n\nBefore the sell-off, gold had been on a blistering yearlong rally, fueled by heavy central bank buying and geopolitical tensions.\n\nThose forces remain in place and could continue to provide support, even as speculation eases.\n\n\"I think the fundamentals remain pretty well in place despite those risks around Fed independence,\" Daniel Hynes, a senior commodities analyst at ANZ , told Bloomberg TV, on Monday.\n\nHynes said broad geopolitical tensions continue to support the gold market, even as he expects price volatility to remain high.\n\n\"The general unbending of the world order that we hear about constantly, and the US's role within that, has really been at the crux of this haven buying, and I don't see that ending any time soon,\" he said.\n\nHowever, analysts are continuing to warn on silver, whose gains have far outpaced gold in recent months due to speculative Chinese demand.\n\nOle Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote on Friday that gold is susceptible to a pullback amid this month's surge in prices. However, price declines in gold are likely to be met with fresh demand.\n\nBut silver may struggle to keep pace with gold.\n\n\"Its heavy reliance — in normal times — on industrial demand could become a drag as some end users, particularly within the solar sector, increasingly seek alternative materials in order to protect margins,\" Hansen wrote.\n\n\"In addition, a rise in scrap supply is expected in the coming months as owners cash in long-held bars, cutlery and jewellery following a seven-fold increase in prices over the past decade,\" he added.",

    "description": "Grammy Award winners like Bad Bunny, Olivia Dean, and Billie Eilish made comments about immigration and spoke out against ICE onstage.",
    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are music's biggest night. This year, they were also a night when music's biggest stars made pointed political statements.\n\nAs President Trump's immigration crackdown rages on amid nationwide protests, musicians used their time on the Grammys stage to make their feelings known.\n\nThe biggest moment of the night came when Bad Bunny dedicated his album of the year award for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" — the first all-Spanish album in history to triumph in the prestigious category — to \"all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams.\"\n\nEarlier in the evening, he used another speech to directly criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say ICE out,\" the Puerto Rican singer said while accepting the award for best música urbana album.\n\nThe chart-topping superstar, who's also set to headline the Super Bowl halftime show next week, continued his speech by emphasizing the humanity of his fellow Latinos and Puerto Ricans.\n\n\"We're not savage,\" he said. \"We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\n\"The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love,\" he added.\n\nDuring an in-audience bit with Grammys host Trevor Noah, Bad Bunny clarified that Puerto Ricans are Americans.\n\n\"If things keep getting bad here in America, can I come live with you in Puerto Rico?\" Noah joked.\n\n\"Trevor, I have news for you,\" Bad Bunny replied. \"Puerto Rico is part of America.\"\n\nBad Bunny previously told i-D magazine that he decided to skip the mainland on his latest tour because he didn't want ICE agents waiting outside his concerts.\n\n\"There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times,\" he said. \"I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US. But specifically, for a residency here in Puerto Rico, when we are an unincorporated territory of the US… People from the US could come here to see the show. Latinos and Puerto Ricans of the United States could also travel here, or to any part of the world. But there was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nOther winners echoed Bad Bunny's message at the ceremony on Sunday, including London native and \"Nice to Each Other\" singer Olivia Dean, who spoke about her immigrant roots while accepting the award for best new artist.\n\n\"I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant,\" Dean said. \"I'm a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated.\"\n\nLater in the evening, Billie Eilish followed suit when she accepted song of the year for \"Wildflower,\" a ballad from her latest album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft.\"\n\n\"No one is illegal on stolen land,\" Eilish said onstage.\n\n\"It's just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,\" she added. \"I feel like we just need to keep fighting and protesting. Our voices really do matter, and the people do matter.\"\n\nEven more Grammy attendees wore \"ICE out\" pins to the ceremony, including Eilish, her brother and producer Finneas O'Connell, Carole King, Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber, and Kehlani, who won best R&B performance during the Grammys premiere ceremony.\n\n\"I really wanted to say fuck ICE,\" Kehlani told The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet. \"We're too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of statement in our country. It's brainless to me.\"",

Capgemini Government Solutions has been under contract since December to provide software that can detect and locate foreign nationals, public records showed.\n\nLast week, Capgemini's CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn that the company was recently made aware of \"the nature and scope of this work.\" He added that the work raised questions about what the business and tech firm typically does.\n\nThe company said the subsidiary made up 0.4% of its revenue last year, and the process to divest it would begin immediately. The $26 billion software firm is among France's largest listed companies.\n\nCapgemini Government Solutions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe recent fatal shootings of American citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis have sparked protests and calls to boycott certain businesses.\n\nOn Friday's \"National Shutdown,\" organizers called for a 24-hour general strike, asking students to skip school, business owners to close up shop, and consumers to refrain from spending. The strike was set up to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the fatal shooting of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nPodcaster Scott Galloway asked Americans to \"opt out\" and \"unsubscribe\" from services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office for February to pressure large companies whose leaders have President Donald Trump's ear.\n\n\"Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House,\" Galloway wrote in a blog post about the boycott.\n\nAnother petition signed by hundreds of tech workers, titled \"Tech demands ICE out of our cities,\" calls on tech leaders to \"pick up the phone\" and call the White House to demand that ICE agents \"leave our cities.\"",

    "description": "The 68th Grammy Awards took place on Sunday. Artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga delivered standout performances, while others fell flat.",
    "fullText": "The 68th annual Grammy Awards yielded plenty of headline-worthy moments, including political statements from stars like Bad Bunny and Olivia Dean, heartfelt tributes to icons like D'Angelo and Ozzy Osbourne, and big wins for Grammy darlings like Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nStill, the vast majority of Sunday's ceremony was dominated by live performances. Several entertainers outshone their peers with showy concepts or scene-stealing vocals, while others proved less than impressive.\n\nKeep reading for a rundown of the best and worst performances.\n\n\"Apt.\" has been inescapable for over a year, dominating Billboard's global 2025 charts, so it runs the risk of sounding stale in 2026. Thankfully, Rosé and Bruno Mars breathed new life into their duet on the Grammys stage, delivering a rock-infused rendition to open the ceremony with a bang.\n\nSabrina Carpenter loves giving her live performances a theme, whether it's descending from the heavens and kissing aliens at the VMAs in 2024, donning a black belt and hitting karate-inspired choreography on \"Saturday Night Live\" last year, or cosplaying as a baggage handler at the Grammys on Sunday.\n\nThe specific role she inhabits hardly matters, because Carpenter always sells it. The song she performed, \"Manchild,\" makes no reference to planes or airports, but as usual, she committed to the bit — with a smile on her face, a spring in her step, and pitch-perfect vocals.\n\nAddison Rae did not have the strongest vocals among the Grammy performers, but vibrato and falsetto are not what have made her a star. Her debut album, \"Addison,\" earned just as much attention for its hypnotic pop music as for Rae's savvy rollout, which featured eye-catching visuals (watch the music video for \"Aquamarine,\" you won't be disappointed) and a flair for theatrics.\n\nRae is a born performer, and she proved exactly that on Sunday by hanging off the back of a truck, wearing a sparkly purple trenchcoat, and singing \"Fame Is a Gun.\" Camp!\n\nFor many pop music lovers, Lady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" was the highlight of 2025. As such, many fans were desperate to see Gaga's weirdness and wonder showcased at the Grammys.\n\nThose fans had their wish granted. Not only did Gaga win a handful of awards, including best pop vocal album and best dance pop recording for \"Abracadabra,\" but she also gave the standout performance of the night.\n\nTyler, the Creator didn't give a predictable or static performance like many of his fellow nominees. Instead, he blended \"Thought I Was Dead\" from album of the year hopeful \"Chromakopia\" with \"Sugar on My Tongue\" from its follow-up album \"Don't Tap the Glass\" into one dynamic production, complete with elaborate set pieces and a surprise cameo from Regina King.\n\nBest new artist nominee Alex Warren seemed to suffer from playback issues when he took the stage on Sunday, but even perfect execution wouldn't have improved his performance much.\n\nWarren sang last summer's big hit \"Ordinary,\" just as he did on the \"Love Is Blind\" season eight reunion, and then again on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" and then at the 2025 American Music Awards, and then again at the 2025 VMAs… you get the picture. The ballad was already boring and dry upon release. Now, there's truly no juice left to squeeze from it.\n\nLola Young is fresh, fun, and, yes, messy — that's what makes her an interesting artist on the rise. Unfortunately, her debut Grammys performance was traditional, slow, and snoozy.\n\nIt makes sense that Young would want to showcase her vocal prowess on music's biggest night, but by transforming her now-Grammy-winning hit \"Messy\" into a piano ballad, she stripped it of the quirks that helped it go viral in the first place.\n\nNot long after delivering a Grammys highlight, Mars returned to the stage for a paint-by-numbers performance of his newest No. 1 hit, \"I Just Might,\" which lacked the novelty and energy of his duet with Rosé.",

    "title": "I embedded myself in a vibe coding team at Gemini's AI hackathon in Singapore. Building an app in 7 hours takes real work.",
    "description": "I followed a hackathon team as they raced to vibe code an app in seven hours at Google's Gemini 3 Hackathon in Singapore.",
    "fullText": "Just after sunrise, four vibe coding enthusiasts from Malaysia crossed into Singapore with a loose idea — and a bet that AI could build most of their app.\n\nHours later, they were racing to prototype it at Google's Gemini 3 Hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThe four friends, all in their late 30s to 40s, came from different professional backgrounds. Chan Wei Khjan is an accountant. Chan Ler-Kuan lectures on AI at a private university. Loh Wah Kiang works in IT. Lee How Siem, who goes by Benny, is the chief technology officer of a Malaysian startup.\n\nTheir initial idea was a \"feng shui\" app to analyze properties in Singapore — a potentially lucrative use case in a market obsessed with housing and wealth accumulation. Feng shui is a traditional Chinese practice that evaluates how a person's surroundings, along with birth factors, influence luck and well-being.\n\nI embedded with the team at Google's developer space in Singapore in January to observe how a vibe-coding project comes together — or nearly falls apart — in seven hours.\n\nThe assignment: Teams of up to four people had to build a working demo, publish a public repository with code, and submit a short video explaining their project by 5:30 p.m.\n\nEach project had to fit into one of six tracks, including generative media, deep research, and enterprise orchestration.\n\nOrganized by Google DeepMind and 65labs, Singapore's AI builder collective, the hackathon featured a 100,000-credit Gemini API prize pool, with first place getting 30,000 credits.\n\nThe team had pivoted to a new idea due to time constraints: a feng shui app that could analyse a user's outfit and workspace through the phone camera in real time and assess how \"lucky\" they were.\n\nWei Khjan took the lead on prompting. He typed the first instructions into Claude, asking it to generate the workflow and code. Ler-Kuan focused on whether the AI's output aligned with feng shui concepts. Wah Kiang and Benny hovered over the codebase, refining ideas and flagging issues.\n\n\"For people who don't know how to read code, it's helpful to have people who do,\" Wei Khjan said.\n\nWhile waiting for the code to be generated, Ler-Kuan opened Google's AI Studio to design the app's logo. They called their app \"Feng Shui Banana.\"\n\nAfter about an hour, Claude generated the initial codebase for the app. It was designed to work with the Gemini Live API, enabling real-time image and text analysis. It ran but was riddled with bugs.\n\nAn error message flashed when they tested the camera feature, so Wei Khjan copied the error back into the AI and asked for it to be fixed. Minutes later, the feature worked.\n\nIt wasn't right. The feng shui logic was off, especially where colour analysis intersected with the user's birth timings. Ler-Kuan manually corrected the underlying dictionary and its mappings.\n\nThe team kept prompting to tighten the features: shorter explanations, clearer output, and more streamlined user interfaces.\n\nLunch arrived. The team stayed glued to their screens.\n\nThe app didn't respond instantly when a user changed their outfit, nor did it update its feng shui analysis in real time.\n\nWei Khjan explained how one prompt matters. Instead of issuing commands, he asked the AI to \"discuss it with me.\" The shift changed how the model reasoned, and it worked more like a collaborator.\n\nAfter some prompting, the app updated with a real-time camera analysis. It was striking to watch a feature emerging from a short back-and-forth with AI.\n\nI helped the team test the app.\n\nThe camera correctly identified what I was wearing: a dark green polo, a yellow participant tag, and a white name card hanging from my neck. According to the app, I was already wearing colours aligned with my luck for the day.\n\nThe app suggested small tweaks, such as additional accessories, that could enhance the feng shui of my outfit.\n\nThey finally had lunch and joked around to ease the tension. Four hours remained before they had to submit their project.\n\nLer-Kuan shifted focus to workspace feng shui, feeding knowledge into the model and refining how the app would evaluate desks and work setups. Wah Kiang and Benny worked on the video demo.\n\nThe team also revisited the app's tagline. After cycling through suggestions from multiple AI models, they settled on a line that didn't come from an AI at all: \"A wisdom, not a superstition.\"\n\nThey used Gemini to generate a storyboard for the demo video. The model laid out several scenes and drafted the script. The team followed along, filming clips and stitching everything together as they went.\n\nTheir workspace feature was also up and running.\n\nThe app had come together nicely. With some time to spare, they decided to add audio output for users who prefer listening to reading on a screen.\n\nThe first attempt to generate a voice using AI fell flat. It sounded robotic.\n\nAfter debugging and several iterations, they landed on a voice they liked, similar to how a Chinese feng shui master might speak.\n\nAs the deadline approached, the team was still stitching clips for their video and nitpicking the AI-generated presenter voice.\n\nThe organizers had urged teams to submit early. With about 15 minutes to spare, they made the call to lock the final cut and hit submit.\n\nThen it was over. The hunger hit immediately, and everyone got in line for some well-deserved food.\n\nEven as an observer, watching from the sidelines was tiring. Seven hours of vibe coding turned out to be anything but effortless.\n\nThe team didn't win a prize, but agreed that the hackathon had been worth it.\n\n\"Sometimes, the best experiences come from saying 'yes' without overthinking,\" said Ler Kuan. \"Innovation starts with curiosity and a little bit of spontaneity.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

That's why she says she leads \"by example\" when it comes to practicing self-love at home.\n\n\"I really try my best to make sure that I speak positively about myself, even on the days that I don't necessarily feel it,\" Kelce told People in an interview published on Sunday.\n\n\"You can say it as much as you want, but we're still human, so there are days when I find myself leading by example for our girls, recognizing, like, 'You know what? I might not feel that way right now, but it is how I should be talking about myself,'\" Kelce said.\n\nKelce has been married to former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce since 2018. They share four daughters: Wyatt Elizabeth, Elliotte Ray, Bennett Llewellyn, and Finnley Anne, who was born in March.\n\nKelce said having daughters has made her more aware of her own self-talk.\n\n\"Motherhood has forced me into the idea that I do need to make sure that I'm speaking positively about myself,\" she said.\n\nMoreover, building confidence early sets her daughters up for happiness and makes them more resilient, she said.\n\n\"You can build these girls up with confidence so that when some silly person somewhere along their way decides to try and switch up the messaging, they've had so much joy just compounded into their ears that it drowns it out and it's a non-issue,\" Kelce said, adding that her daughters can easily brush off negative comments when it conflicts with what they've been taught about themselves since they were young.\n\n\"Through motherhood, you see how getting that positive messaging across then makes those intrusive and negative thoughts not mean as much,\" she said.\n\nKelce isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about the importance of modeling confidence for children.\n\nIn November, makeup mogul Charlotte Tilbury said she doesn't experience imposter syndrome because of her mother, who showered her with praise from an early age.\n\n\"Thank God — I mean, as mothers do, darling — she just told me I was fabulous. Thank God for Mommy. She just said I was fabulous, so I believed her,\" Tilbury said.\n\nIn December, Zooey Deschanel said she doesn't let her two kids see her insecure.\n\n\"I always want them to think I'm happy with myself and, like, because they get their self-esteem from their parents, you know. So yeah, it's important to me to, like, show up with confidence,\" she said.",

Obviously they paid a lot of money for him and these two [Wirtz and Ekitike] seem to have a real good understanding of each other's game and they look like a real threat.\n\n\"Ekitike's second goal in particular was brilliant, it reminds me of Romario. A little toe-poke goal but it's instinctive.\n\n\"He is the type of player I like to watch. He's not a number nine, he's not a number 10. He drifts out wide, he gets on the ball, brings players into the game and he can score goals. So he's got a bit of everything really.\"",

    "fullText": "Transfer deadline day has become an event for fans and something of a media circus in recent years, but it has always been an important day for managers, even before the current system of having transfer windows was introduced in 2002.\n\nGet it right - and get the player or players you want in at the 11th hour - and you can turn your season around.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't get important deals done or lose someone without replacing them, it can take the wind out of your sails and deflate a team involved in a promotion bid or survival battle.\n\nI never saw making late signings as a risk, because I always thought the players I was bringing in would make the team better.\n\nLooking back at the transfer deadline day deals I was involved in was really interesting. Yes, I had a few stinkers, but also some really good ones. A theme emerged which showed that if you can do good business, it can really change the fortunes of the team.\n\nAt Crystal Palace on the final day of the January window in 2014, for example, the permanent additions of Scott Dann, Wayne Hennessey, Joe Ledley and also Tom Ince on loan, sparked an amazing turnaround.\n\nWe were in a relegation battle and in serious trouble near the bottom of the Premier League when they arrived but we ended up 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three, after securing our survival with three games to go.\n\nAll four new players were great positives who played a huge part in our improvement. I am not saying they upgraded the quality of our players but they gave us a better balance as a team, which I felt we lacked before they came in.\n\nGaining that balance enabled us to stay in the Premier League.",

    "description": "Colorful, successful, beloved, Holtz always knew what to say — and how to say it.",
    "fullText": "Lou Holtz is on the ropes, but this modern-day Will Rogers has a legacy that will endure the ages.\n\nHoltz, 89, is reported to be in hospice as his health has declined in recent weeks. He has been an iconic voice for college football, sports in general and life specifically.\n\nI remember him delivering one-liners at a bowl game luncheon that BYU was involved in, and he didn’t disappoint.\n\nA former coach at Notre Dame, who won a national championship during his 11 seasons in South Bend, he commanded hefty fees for speaking engagements and appearances, and he never failed to deliver or inspire.\n\nThe players dinner for the United States Golf Association’s 2014 Mid-Amateur in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is a perfect example of how the 2008 College Football Hall of Fame inductee delivered his wisdom with humility, candor and humor.\n\nHoltz told the field of 264 players, narrowed from a group of 3,891, they’d maneuvered a great challenge, “But if what you did yesterday looks good to you, then you haven’t done much today. That’s why the good Lord put eyes in front of you, not in back of you.”\n\nHere are some of my favorite quotes from Hotlz over the years:\n\n— Greg Flugaur (@flugempire) January 30, 2026\n\n“Don’t complicate it. Do you realize there are only five colors in a rainbow? That’s all, five. Think what Michelangelo did with those five colors. There are only seven musical notes. Seven! Look at what Beethoven did with those seven musical notes. So, I try to keep life simple.”\n\n“I don’t understand how a black cow eats green grass and produces white milk. I don’t understand why they sell hotdogs in packages of six and hot dog buns in packages of eight. I don’t understand why a kamikaze pilot wore a helmet.”\n\nHoltz is the only coach to lead six different teams (William & Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas, Minnesota, Notre Dame and South Carolina) to bowl games and four teams to final top-20 rankings. He knows pressure. And here’s what he said about it.\n\n“Pressure to me is when you have to do something that you are not prepared to do. If you have to make a 5-foot putt and you haven’t practiced enough, you’re going to feel pressure. If you practiced it, you want to be there to show people how good you are.”\n\n“If you’ve got to take a test to get into medical school and you haven’t prepared, you’re nervous. If you’ve really prepared for that test and they cancel it, you’re disappointed. You want to show them how much you’ve done and that’s what pressure is.”\n\n“The best advice I can give you is win. Win stands for what’s important now (WIN). You’ve just had a birdie, what’s important now? The (next) tee shot. You’ve just made a bogey, what’s important now? Tee shot. Evaluate the past, focus on the future, but tell yourself what you have to do in the present.”\n\n“Ten percent of you won’t remember 10 percent of what I said 10 minutes after I said it.”\n\n“I’m not a dancer, not an entertainer, not an intellect. I graduated in the lower third of my high school class. If there wasn’t people like me, there wouldn’t have been an upper half.”\n\n“I have written three New York Times best-sellers. I’m the guy in the world who has written more books than he has read.”\n\n“He’s smart, he’s intelligent, and I love him like a brother, but we have a difference of opinion. He was a player, I was a coach. He made suggestions, I made decisions. He showered after work, I showered before work. He signed his paycheck on the back. I sighed it on the front. On TV, I tell him, ‘Mark, I would love to agree with you, but if I did, we’d both be wrong.”\n\n“Ability is what you’re capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.”\n\n“It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it.”\n\n“Life is 10 percent what happens to you and 90 percent how you respond to it.”\n\n“I can’t believe that God put us on this earth to be ordinary.”\n\n“No one has ever drowned in sweat.”\n\n“Don’t tell your problems to people: eighty percent don’t care; and the other twenty percent are glad you have them.”\n\n“When all is said and done, more is said than done.”\n\n“I follow three rules: Do the right thing, do the best you can, and always show people you care.”\n\n“Virtually nothing is impossible in this world if you just put your mind to it and maintain a positive attitude.”\n\n“You’re never as good as everyone tells you when you win, and you’re never as bad as they say when you lose.”\n\nFormer BYU athletic director Val Hale remembers a story Holtz told about playing Navy with the banners of all the World War II naval battles hanging on the press box. A player said, “We can’t beat those guys. Look at the schedule they play!”\n\nSaid Hale: “Lou Holtz was obviously an enormously successful football coach, and that was because he was a great motivator. I loved listening to him talk. He was so inspiring — and funny. He reminded me a little of Frank Layden. He was full of stories. I can only imagine what playing for him was like.”\n\nAll of our days are numbered, and if Coach Holtz is looking at his last days, I hope that if there are games in heaven and there is a need for a commentator, the angels call Lou and give him some airtime.",

    "fullText": "Cincinnati Bengals urged to sign All-Pro defender in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDefense has been a persistent problem for the Cincinnati Bengals in recent seasons, and they’re being urged to do something about it.\n\nPro Football Focus’ Bradley Locker recently listed one free agent that every team should pursue over the offseason, and for the Bengals, that pick was linebacker Devin Lloyd.\n\nLloyd is coming off of the first Pro Bowl and Second Team All-Pro nods of his career, and would represent a clear upgrade for Cincinnati in the middle of the field.\n\n“The Bengals have no choice but to tweak their defensive personnel this season after finishing 29th in EPA per play and 28th in success rate. Although all three levels could use boosts, Cincinnati ranked dead last in overall grade at linebacker — which Lloyd could fix in one fell swoop,” Locker wrote.\n\nMore: Bengals predicted to land two-time Super Bowl champion in free agency\n\n\"... With the seventh-most cap space currently available, the Bengals could use a defensive splash, and the 27-year-old would definitely qualify.\"\n\nIn 15 regular season games for the Jacksonville Jaguars this past season, Lloyd recorded 81 tackles, including six for a loss, seven passes defended, five interceptions, 1.5 sacks and one fumble recovery.\n\nHis productive play probably made the Jaguars regret declining his fifth-year option prior to the season. If they had picked the option up, they could have had Lloyd back in Jacksonville at a reasonable rate next season.\n\nInstead, they'll likely lose him in free agency. But, Jacksonville's loss can be another team's gain.

    "fullText": "At -125, Shohei Ohtani is breathing rarefied air at his current price.\n\nConsider last year, when he was the overwhelming preseason favorite to win NL MVP, and he was still only +150 by the end of March, per Sports Odds History. That was already crazy, because the shortest number we've generally seen in recent years is +200 or +300.\n\nBelow, we'll look at the early MLB odds for the 2026 season, and AL & NL MVP, as the likes of Alex Bregman (Chicago Cubs) and Kyle Tucker (Los Angeles Dodgers) have found new homes since our previous look.\n\nHere are the last 10 winners of the AL and NL MVP Award, with Shohei Ohtani leading the way as a four-time winner, with two in the AL and two in the NL. Only Frank Robinson has also won MVP awards in both leagues.\n\nBarry Bonds holds the record for most MVP awards (seven)\n\nThe New York Yankees have won the most MVPs in MLB history with 25, while the St. Louis Cardinals are second, leading all NL teams, with 21. No player for the Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Mets, or Tampa Bay Rays has ever won MVP.\n\nMost sportsbooks will display odds in the American format as listed above. When Goldschmidt ran away with the MVP award in 2022 his odds had a minus (-) sign ahead of the number for a large part of the season.\n\nThat means that a bettor in August had to wager $6,000 to win $100 by betting on Goldy to win MVP. Before the season starts, almost every player will have a plus (+) sign ahead of their odds.\n\nThat means a bettor would have profited $200 for a $100 wager on Ohtani before the season started.\n\nIf American odds aren't your thing, simply use a tool like our odds converter to switch the odds to decimal or fractional format. Most online sportsbooks also give you the option to change the odds format that you see.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJordon Hudson took Bill Belichick’s Pro Football Hall of Fame snub personal by planning a celebration of her own.\n\nAccording to a report from People, Belichick's girlfriend is organizing a “huge bash” for the legendary coach on Aug. 8 — the same day the Pro Football Hall of Fame will induct its Class of 2026 in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThe party is expected to take place just weeks before Belichick begins his second season as the head coach at North Carolina. The event is reportedly intended as a show of support after Belichick fell one vote short of first-ballot induction, receiving 39 of the 40 votes required for election.\n\nHudson is expected to invite several prominent figures closely tied to Belichick’s career, including Tom Brady, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells. Many of whom would have otherwise attended the ceremony in Canton. An anonymous source told People the purpose of the bash is “to celebrate alongside all of his people.”\n\nBelichick’s omission sparked widespread reaction across the NFL world, with reports suggesting internal politics among voters may have played a role.\n\nIn response to the backlash, the Hall of Fame released a statement affirming the integrity of its selection process and noting that any violations of voting bylaws could result in disciplinary action.\n\nBelichick, who owns eight Super Bowl rings — six as a head coach — and a 302-165 career record, has not publicly addressed the snub.

    "description": "The Ravens have identified two candidates to serve as their new wide receivers coach.",
    "fullText": "Ravens offensive coordinator Declan Doyle has identified two initial candidates to be the wide receivers coach on his new staff following Greg Lewis’ departure to Cleveland.\n\nPrentice Gill, who has been an offensive assistant in Baltimore for the last two years, will interview for the job this week, per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero. Gill is officially listed as a coaching fellow in the team media guide. He has primarily worked with the Ravens’ receivers and oversaw back-to-back Pro Bowl campaigns from Zay Flowers. Rashod Bateman also put up career-highs in 2024, though he regressed significantly this past season.\n\nGill played wide receiver at Old Dominion University and moved into coaching after he finished school. He worked his way up through the college ranks and eventually worked at USC under then-OC, now-Ravens QBs coach Tee Martin. Jobs at Oregon, Arizona State, and prep school powerhouse IMG Academy followed before Gill’s move to the NFL in 2024. In that time, Gill worked with an impressive list of wide receivers, including Amon-Ra St. Brown, Michael Pittman, JuJu-Smith Schuster, Ricky Pearsall, Velus Jones Jr., and projected 2024 first-round pick Carnell Tate. Gill also coached Johnny Wilson and Juwan Johnson in college, who both converted to tight end in the NFL.\n\nThe Ravens are also expected to interview Jaguars assistant WRs coach Tyler Tettleton, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. That name may be familiar to Baltimore sports fans. Tyler Tettleton’s father, Mickey, was a star catcher for the Orioles from 1988 to 1990 with All-Star and Silver Slugger honors in 1989.\n\nTyler Tettleton played football at Ohio University before embarking on a coaching career in 2015. He spent three years at the University of Oklahoma before one-year stints with the Jets, the Browns, LSU, and his alma mater before arriving in Jacksonville as an assistant running backs coach in 2022. He moved over to assistant WRs coach in 2023 and survived the Jaguars’ 2025 coaching change to Liam Coen.\n\nTettleton has also worked with several talented wide receivers in his career, though he has not always been coaching them directly. He overlapped with Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr. in Cleveland and Terrace Marshall, Kayshon Boutte, and Trey Palmer at LSU. In Jacksonville, he helped Travis Etienne hit the ground running in 2022 after missing his entire rookie season due to injury. He then coached Calvin Ridley to a 1,000-yard campaign in his first season back from suspension and assisted in the rookie breakout of 2024 first-round pick Brian Thomas Jr. Thomas struggled this season, but 2023 sixth-rounder Parker Washington had a breakout season of his own under Tettleton’s tutelage.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe chants were the kind that you'd never think would be heard in Olean, New York.\n\n\"Fire Mark Schmidt\" were the cries of some St. Bonaventure basketball fans recently, directed at the Bonnies' head coach since 2007.\n\nAnd, well, it's quite shocking.\n\nThe Bonnies fell to 13-9 on the season with a loss in their most recent game, but it was a four-point defeat to a George Mason team that's 20-2, so not exactly a brutal loss.\n\nHas St. Bonaventure been quite up to par of some of the Schmidt era in the past few years? Not really.\n\nBut a chant to fire the guy? Man, that seems misguided.\n\nFormer Bonnies player Dion Wright had this to say on X:\n\nIt’s either you die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain . . . Chanting “fire schmidt” is absolutely disgusting. A lot of people didn’t even know anything about St. Bonaventure until he got there. At the end of the day it’s a players game.\n\n— Dion Wright (@TheWrightHoops) February 1, 2026\n\nThe four seasons before Schmidt was hired at Bonaventure all featured single-digit wins.\n\nIt took him just one year of rebuilding before he got to 15 wins in his second season.\n\nThey haven't won fewer than 14 games in a season in his entire tenure.\n\nThat includes three NCAA Tournament appearances and two trips to the Round of 32.\n\nSchmidt is Bonaventure's all-time wins leader, now with 337 wins and counting.\n\nAnd this isn't like other jobs. Bonaventure, with an enrollment of less than 3,000 students, is one of the few smallest Division I basketball programs in the country.\n\nIn the NIL era and transfer-heavy era, it's hard to get recruits to come to Olean.\n\nAnd so somehow, that all led to the chants by Bonnies fans. Apparently some people feel that way.\n\nThere are plenty of St. Bonaventure faithful who would never dream such a fate on Schmidt.\n\nMORE: Gerry McNamara shares his thoughts on Adrian Autry",

    "fullText": "Florida State (7-15, 2-8 ACC) was defeated by Clemson (16-7, 7-4 ACC) by a 77-58 score this afternoon at Littlejohn Coliseum.\n\nClemson scored the first four points of the game as the Tigers did a great job forcing Florida State to take tough shots. Sole Williams hit a driving layup for the first Seminole points. Midway through the quarter Clemson hit FSU with a 10-2 run to take a 16-9 lead. Tatum Greene buried a three to end the run. Taylor Johnson-Matthews hit a triple to give Clemson a 21-15 lead going into the second quarter.\n\nThat shot from Johnson-Matthews sparked the Tigers to a 10-1 run that allowed them to take a 28-16 lead. Mari Gerton broke the run with a nifty putback. However, the Tigers were able to stretch the lead to 42-27 at the half.\n\nThe Tigers ended the third quarter on a 10-2 run to take a 60-41 lead into the fourth quarter. From there Clemson cruised to the 77-58 victory.\n\nSole Williams was the only Seminole in double figures with 23 points.\n\nThe story of this game was that Florida State was unable to maintain any offensive continuity. If the Seminoles aren’t hitting threes (5-21 today) the offense really struggles. This is due to the fact that FSU rarely gets easy baskets. There are a couple of reasons for the lack of easy baskets. First, Florida State usually plays one-on-one offense in the frontcourt. This means that unless there is a blow-by, the shot will be contested. Secondly, the Seminoles don’t get many transition buckets (two fast break points today) or second chance points (13 today). These are the two main ways to get easy baskets.\n\nThe Seminoles did hold their own on the boards and they only had 12 turnovers which is a reasonable number. However, it is tough to beat good teams when you shoot so poorly from the field.\n\nThe Seminoles will travel to Raleigh, NC to face NC State on Thursday. The game will tip at 8pm and will be broadcast on the ACC Network.",

    "description": "When Justin Rose won the 2019 Farmers Insurance Open, his longtime looper, Mark Fulcher, watched from a hospital bed after having heart surgery",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — There was a celebration before the celebration during Justin Rose’s triumphant walk up the 18th hole at Torrey Pines on Sunday in his seven-shot victory in the Farmers Insurance Open.\n\nAs the CBS cameras followed Rose and his caddie, Mark “Fooch” Fulcher, the two exchanged laughs and a message into the camera for the golfer’s one-time caddie, Gareth Lord. It was Lord who was on Rose’s bag in 2019 when the Englishman won his first title at Torrey Pines. At the time, Fulcher watched the proceedings from a hospital bed, having undergone mitral valve surgery on his heart that January.\n\n“I think we were just trying to have a little bit of banter and make light of the fact, ‘Hey, Lordie, I hope you're watching now because now it's Fooch's turn to be walking down the 18th with me here at Torrey,’” Rose said in the winner’s news conference.\n\nAs Rose fashioned a historic victory in which he set the 36-, 54 and 72-hole scoring records, ultimately finishing at 23 under, he said he never brought up the past with Fulcher—until the end.\n\nAfter recovering from the surgery, Fulcher returned to loop for Rose at the 2019 Masters, but soon after announced that he’d be taking a leave. Rose won twice in the interim before he and Fulcher reunited at the 2023 Ryder Cup, and together they won the 2025 FedEx St. Jude Championship in the playoffs. Among the victories for which Fulcher has been on Rose’s bag are his 2013 U.S. Open win and gold medal performance in the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n“I think that win,” Rose said of the 2019 Farmers, “was always a tough one for Fooch—not fighting for his life, but he was in a pretty bad way in the hospital and seeing us kind of cruise to victory and, you know, hugging Lordie on the 18th green.\n\n“Nearly had to have another procedure after that, I think,” Rose added with a chuckle.\n\n“It was in my head all [this] week, 'wouldn't be it nice to win with Fooch here.' It was totally unsaid until across the water on 18. I was, like, that was fun to enjoy that with him.”",

    "description": "Amid the talk about the Dodgers' spending, a special agreement between MLB and the Dodgers over L.A.'s TV money share has come up.",
    "fullText": "Amid the conversation about the team’s spending, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ TV deal with Spectrum has come up, namely, a special clause that allows the Dodgers to retain an additional portion of their TV revenue.\n\nThe signing of outfielder Kyle Tucker has sparked a total meltdown on social media, with fanbases from all over the MLB spectrum coming out of the woodwork and calling out the Dodgers for “ruining baseball.”\n\nTucker is set to earn $60 million per season, an incredibly high average annual value, which will have him among the highest-paid athletes in the sport. He is joining a team already full of stars in Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Freddie Freeman — the reigning World Series champions.\n\nAs a result, an agreement between the Dodgers’ owners, the Guggenheim Group, and MLB has begun to circulate.\n\nThe LA Times’ Bill Shaikin outlined the terms of the deal between MLB and the Dodgers that have indeed led to the team keeping a larger share of its revenue.\n\nWhile trying to oust Frank McCourt as an owner in MLB, the league blocked a $3 billion deal between the Dodgers and Fox Sports, prompting McCourt to file a suit in bankruptcy court.\n\nMcCourt was trying to sell the team for all its worth, and he needed to make sure bidders knew what to expect from a TV deal.\n\nIn bankruptcy court, MLB agreed that the fair-market value for the Dodgers’ TV deal was the Fox offer, meaning the league would take its 34 percent cut based on those terms.\n\nHowever, the Dodgers ended up striking a deal worth more than $8 billion, though MLB could not take more from the new deal.\n\nDuring an appearance on Dodgers Dougout with Doug McKain, Shakin explained how the deal materialized.\n\n“In a nutshell, in order to get Frank McCourt out, which was the objective from MLB, they had to make a deal with him in bankruptcy court,” Shakin said on the show.\n\n“And part of that deal was how are you going to value the television contract? And since a television contract did not exist at that time, because a new owner had not even been selected, they did the best they could.\n\n“And Guggenheim came out with a really great offer that I think blew even MLB’s wildest expectations away. MLB wasn’t thrilled, but they’re living by the terms of the deal, and that’s where we are.”\n\nA lot of people have been on the timeline complaining about the Dodgers “unfair TV deal”\n\nThe truth is even if the Dodgers gave up more of that money to other teams, opposing owners still wouldn’t spend ????\n\n(W/ @dmac_la) pic.twitter.com/f4wkjmBU4D\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) January 28, 2026\n\nMLB did try to push for new terms that hold the Dodgers to the same standard as other teams, but the settlement in bankruptcy court was too much of a blocker.\n\nHowever, as Shakin outlines, the Dodgers’ new owners, Guggenheim, did work with MLB to find a middle ground.\n\n“So in a normal situation, Major League Baseball would have said, this is a crazy high deal and good for you, and we’re happy, but we gotta share this money just like we share any other money.\n\n“And in this case, MLB could only push so far because Guggenheim was willing to work with MLB to a point. And then Guggenheim could have gone back to the court and said, ‘we got a deal, please, Mr. Judge, enforce the deal. That’s what you’re here for.’\n\n“And the court, as they say in legal circles, has jurisdiction over the deal, which means they run everything.\n\n“So, MLB could have been stuck with the original settlement, which was not as favorable as what they got in the negotiations with Guggenheim.\n\n“Is it equal for all other teams? Absolutely not. Is it a competitive advantage for the Dodgers? Sure. Now, is it as big a competitive advantage as some people are making it? I don’t think so ’cause the contract itself is way more than the individual amount the Dodgers are saving every year.”",

    "fullText": "Football doesn’t start at kick-off. It starts when you leave the house. As the new season gets underway this month, let's reflect on what has earned K league a permanent spot in our hearts.\n\nThe growing desire for more analytically based football commentary has seeped its way into Korea. This is partly due to the surge of young talent, and to established K League players, now attracting the gaze of European (and sometimes Asian and North American) scouting departments. Oxford United supporters will want more substance than“Jeon Jin-woo is a really good player” before welcoming him to the Kassam Stadium.\n\nAlways a special moment. The floodlights are on as they appear for the first time.\n\nHowever, even I must draw the line somewhere. Covering Suwon Bluewings has been both fun and tragic - depending on the fortunes of the club - but delving deeper into the tactical approach of Byun Seung-hwan during his ill-fated spell in charge of the Bluewings doesn’t keep me awake at night. Nor does duels won, or any of the following in the alphabet soup; xG, xA, PPDA, OBV, and npxG.\n\nWhat excites me far more is the smell of a K League stadium on matchday. Regular viewers will know Korean grounds come in all shapes and sizes: from giant 2002 World Cup venues, to rudimentary multi-purpose local grounds with basic amenities, to city-built concrete bowls with temporary seating added to improve the experience, to the small - but hopefully increasing - number of football-specific stadiums.\n\nIf you are looking for club names that represent all of those styles, I give you: FC Seoul (2002 World Cup), Busan IPark (basic structure), FC Anyang (temporary seating), and Daegu FC (football-specific). Korean geography experts will be aware that these clubs are situated from north to south, in different cities across different provinces. It is a hotchpotch of styles, sizes, and designs.\n\nBig Bird: Defined by that roof covering those seats.\n\nAnd let’s pay tribute to the grounds I haven’t mentioned yet. For World Cup memories, how about Suwon’s magnificent Big Bird, with its landmark roof covering the main stand? Or Jeju’s own version, accompanied by views of the ocean and an extinct volcano? How about the football-specific marvels in Pohang and Incheon - easily two of the country’s best venues? Like Anyang, Bucheon and Gangwon have sought to minimise the impact of the running track. But if you prefer big, brutalist concrete bowls, trot along to Gimcheon, Cheongju, or Paju.\n\nOne thing Korean stadiums have in common, though (with the occasional exception of Daegu and Incheon), is that getting a ticket to see the football is rarely a problem. Daegu’s small capacity of 12,419 means a sell-out is possible, but for almost every other stadium in Korea, access is guaranteed - even without buying a ticket in advance.\n\nWhen the last of the winter snow finally melts away, Korea really comes alive. Nothing grows in winter. The trees are bare for several months. No flowers can pierce the icy ground. A country so vibrant with colour and vegetation becomes a post-apocalyptic wasteland during the short, bitter days of winter. There is an absence of green. Even the ground is brown and lifeless.\n\nThe end of that is the beginning of football.\n\nIncheon's South Stand is one-of-a-kind in Korea.\n\nHow tragic would it be if the K League decided - or was forced - to adopt a more global calendar, playing through the winter in what is rapidly becoming the September-May norm? The heat and humidity of July and August are genuine concerns, but is that worse than frozen pitches, the possibility of heavy snow causing cancellations, and temperatures in some parts of the country dipping to -14°C? I’ll let you decide.\n\nThat debate can be saved for another day. Like most football fans, the itch to return to a stadium is becoming unbearable. I miss football, but I don’t yearn for discussions about our main striker’s xG, the new formation the manager is trying in pre-season, how the foreign imports will adapt, or how good this teenage local lad might be.\n\nAs much as anywhere on the planet, Korean football is about the matchday experience.\n\nIt starts with an early-morning KTX trip from Gwangmyeong Station to Gimcheon. From there, a local bus to the city centre for lunch. By now, you’ve already caught your first glimpse of jerseys walking down the street. This is when the excitement and anticipation really begin to rise. Follow the crowd until you catch sight of a stadium wall, or a floodlight set against the backdrop of a magnificent mountain.\n\nOver the years, I’ve accumulated some great K League memories simply from walking to a stadium. From Seogwipo, the walk to Jeju’s wonderful stadium is around five kilometres. It is long - and probably excessive - but the glorious coastline keeps you company along the way. The sparkle off the sea as the sun sets in the west is a joy to behold. You cannot escape the gaze of Hallasan to your right, nor the rich vegetation and palm trees spread out in all directions.\n\nCompare that with modern-day Anyang. Leaving the city centre towards the Sports Complex, the scenery shifts from the quiet beauty of the Anyang River to the incomprehensible scale of heavy construction surrounding the stadium. I have photos of Anyang Stadium from 2020, with Gwanaksan and planes landing at Gimpo clearly visible. Those days are gone now, but it does highlight the immense potential of the club as they look to prolong their stay in K League 1.\n\nAs the skyline changes rapidly around Anyang Stadium, treasure moments like this.\n\nI don’t think any walk compares to a visit to Pohang Steel Yard. This is partly out of necessity - Pohang is a small city with no subway system. The stadium sits across the river from the city centre, buried deep within the POSCO complex. Buses and cars crawl along at a snail’s pace. But the walk itself is fascinating. Only then can you truly appreciate the size and scale of POSCO; the stadium is dwarfed in comparison. If you’re lucky, the stroll will be interrupted by a slow-moving cargo train.\n\nAfterall, Korean stadiums are shaped by their surroundings. Like Pohang, the backdrop to Jeonnam Dragons' home stadium isn't defined by lush forests or imposing mountains. Smoke towers from another POSCO factory puncture the skyline. Busan's Gudeok couldn't be more distinct. The stadium has no remarkable features, but that is compensated by the backdrop of Gudeok Mountain.\n\nSadly, we mourn the loss of Gangwon FC's former home. It is a massive shame Chuncheon is off the menu in 2026, although it will host K3 matches. Chuncheon has one of Korea's best culinary experiences indakgalbi - stir-fried chicken marinated in a spicy gochujang-based sauce. The 45-minute walk to the stadium is irrelevant when you reach the banks of North Han River, with its breathtaking views of the river and mountains. You can even go canoeing or take a cable car before kickoff.\n\nKorean football is a league of journeys. Some are short, whilst others require an airplane. None are long enough that can be considered burdensome. Seongnam's Tacheon Stadium is next to the river by the same name. River paths and biking go hand-in-hand in Korea. Hwaseong Stadium is the only one that tests your sense of adventure. Good luck getting there if you don't have a car.\n\nTo give the K League some credit, player names on jerseys are still written in hangeul. Outside the stadium, an hour before kick-off, as you sip a cold can of beer, watch the supporters shuffle past in their own unique colours, with hangeul characters on their backs. The green of Jeonbuk Hyundai to the orange of Gangwon FC. Jeonnam Dragons in yellow to Cheonan City in sky blue. Different names, colours, crest. Each adds something to the rich tapestry of K League football.\n\nOnce inside, it doesn’t get much better than a sunny Saturday afternoon in Suwon. The seating colour scheme, the razor sharp edges of the stands, the blue jerseys, flags, the second-half umbrella display, and the constant beat of La Banda de Uman. It is the best stadium in Korea to sit back and reflect on the meaning of it all, as 22 players and 14,000 fans put on a show for you.\n\nThere are more. Anyang under the lights is raucous. FC Seoul can attract Premier League-level crowds once or twice a season. Incheon United’s stadium oozes class, not least the single-tier terrace behind the goal. Then there is the aforementioned Pohang: a distinct two-tiered stadium with steep stands offering perfect sight-lines.\n\nPohang Steel Yard with its steep stands is very atmospheric.\n\nThis is not to say analytics are unimportant in football. There is clearly a market for them, as fans try to understand more about a new signing or a rumoured name arriving from overseas. But that conversation has never been what draws me back, week after week.\n\nFor me, football lives in the hours before kick-off. It lives on train platforms, on crowded buses, and on long walks through unfamiliar neighbourhoods. It lives in the first sight of a floodlight between apartment blocks, in the slow build of noise as more scarves and jerseys appear, and in the way a stadium reveals itself - suddenly or gradually - depending on where you are.\n\nThe K League is not something I analyse. It is something I travel through. It changes with the seasons, with the cities, and with the people who follow it. You can measure passes, pressing, and probability if you like - but you cannot evaluate the feeling of arriving.\n\nThat is the side of Korean football I want to share with you in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Alongside Marcel Sabitzer (back), captain Emre Can also missed out due to illness. Niklas Süle, on the other hand, returned to the squad. Four days after the Champions League match against Inter Milan (a 2-0 defeat), head coach Niko Kovac made five changes to the starting XI, as Anton, Couto, Svensson, Adeyemi and Brandt replaced Ryerson, Bensebaini, Beier and Fabio Silva (who all dropped to the bench), while Can missed out completely. Filippo Mane remained in the team.\n\nThe match:With courageous, high pressing, Heidenheim put BVB under pressure early on, disrupting the build-up play and celebrated every Black & Yellow misplaced pass as confirmation of their own performance. Dortmund had a hard time finding gaps in the opponents, who were man-marking tightly and uncompromisingly. Corners led to a lot of pushing and pulling in the six-yard box.\n\nAnd so it went until the 14th minute, before 81,365 spectators in the sold-out SIGNAL IDUNA PARK saw the first shot: for once, Guirassy had shaken off Mainka, but failed to beat the Heidenheim goalkeeper Ramaj from a tight angle. On 38 minutes, after good work by Brandt, Guirassy’s delicate chip struck the crossbar. Until then, there had been only two chances for BVB, and Heidenheim also had one, but Kobel denied Dinkci from eleven metres out in the 26th minute.\n\nThe eighth (!) corner finally gave BVB the lead shortly before the break. Couto floated the cross in, and Siersleben hindered his own goalkeeper, causing Ramaj to drop the ball. Anton reacted the fastest, making it 1-0 in the 44th minute. But at the end of the five-minute injury time period, Heidenheim’s Honsak made good progress down the left, Mane picked up an injury and had to pull up. Honsak’s cross landed at the feet of Niehues, who prodded the ball over the line to make it 1-1 going into the break .\n\nSüle replaced Mane at the restart and shortly afterwards let Heidenheim substitute Arijon Ibrahimovic past him, whose back pass found Niehues, who hammered the ball goalwards from 22 metres out. Svensson got his thigh in the way, but the deflection gave Kobel no chance and the away side celebrated a 2-1 lead in the 48th minute. Ten minutes later, Marvin Pieringer was given the freedom of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK and could have added a third. Kovac responded, and instantly looked to get his side on the front foot: Beier replaced Couto, Chukwuemeka came on for Bellingham, with Brandt dropping a little deeper.\n\nWithin two minutes, the Black & Yellow had turned the game around. After Brandt’s cross, Guirassy was denied by Ramaj, and Nmecha’s follow-up from the resulting corner was cleared. But the VAR intervened: Dorsch had handled the ball after Brandt’s cross. Dr. Jöllenbeck pointed to the spot. Ramaj managed to get a touch on Guirassy’s well placed shot, but couldn’t keep it out – it was 2-2 in the 68th minute. Less than two minutes later, Brandt initiated a counter-attack. Beier stormed down the right wing, cut the ball back to Guirassy, who got a good connection despite being on his way down five yards from goal, and the ball found the corner to make it 3-2 on 70 minutes.\n\nFive minutes before the final whistle, Guirassy could have put the game to bed early. Jöllenbeck did not hesitate to give another penalty after Busch fouled Guirassy. This time, however, Guirassy shot well over the bar, meaning the game was still alive. Instead, Ibrahimovic missed a chance to potentially make it 3-3 at the start of the eight minutes of injury time, but his effort whistled past the post. Then Mikkel Kaufmann grazed the crossbar in the 95th minute, but the guests did not manage to get the ball over the line, and the Black & Yellow.\n\nOutlook:  After six games in three weeks to kick off the year, BVB have their first \"normal\" week of training of the year, which will end next Saturday with the away game at VfL Wolfsburg (kick-off: 15:30 CET)..\n\nFootball Bundesliga, Matchday 20 Saturday, 1 February 2026, 17:30 CET\n\nBor. Dortmund: Kobel – Mane (Süle, 46), Anton, Schlotterbeck – Yan Couto (Beier, 58), Bellingham (Chukwuemeka, 58), Nmecha, Svensson – Adeyemi (Fabio Silva, 69), Brandt – Guirassy (90+3 Özcan)\n\nBench: Meyer, Drewes, Bensebaini, Ryerson\n\n1. FC Heidenheim. Ramaj – Busch, Mainka, Siersleben – Traoré (Schimmer, 80), Dorsch, Niehues (Schöppner, 70), Behrens, Dinkci (Kaufmann, 80) – Pieringer (Conteh, 80), Honsak (Ibrahimovic, 46)\n\nBench: Feller, Föhrenbach, Beck, Kerber",

    "fullText": "(at the press conference): “Today, you saw a game that was great for the spectators, but less so for me personally as a coach. I want to see games like these put to bed much more confidently, more quickly and earlier, rather than getting ourselves in trouble. The bottom line, however, is a team that gets up again in the second half after going behind and has the ability to fight back again. We have started the Bundesliga in 2026 with four wins and a draw. I’m happy about that.”\n\nThe press conference with both head coaches\n\nSebastian Kehl (in the mixed zone): “We take the lead, but we don’t get the game done and dusted, then we concede two goals relatively quickly and find ourselves behind. What was really good was that we showed a strong mentality, that we got back into the game. Nevertheless, it was tight again. We want to do better. We need to do better. That has to be our target. Once again, we missed one or two chances to score the fourth or fifth goal to settle the game in our favour. We need to play football better. We need to win games more comfortably.” We need to work on ourselves before we think about anything else.”\n\nNico Schlotterbeck (on DAZN): “We controlled the first half, and then it's 1-1 because Filippo (Mane) gets injured.” In the second half there were some crazy moments for both sides. We had a lot of chances, but we also allowed them a lot and were a bit fortunate to win – but we got the win. The problem (with both penalties, which Schlotterbeck ultimately passed the ball to Serhou Guirassy) is that they try to unsettle the penalty taker. And penalties are not my core discipline. I waited until everyone was out of the way and asked Serhou if he felt confident and wanted to shoot.”\n\nSerhou Guirassy (on DAZN): “Sometimes I score, sometimes I don’t. Last year, I scored, I don't know, maybe 45 goals. This season is a little more difficult. That’s football. I play to have fun. And for me, it was a crazy game because it was like this on one hand (scoring two goals) – and on the other hand like that (missing a penalty). But we won again, and that is the most important thing. But that’s it for me on penalties for the time being.”\n\nGregor Kobel (in the mixed zone): “The points are all that matters. But of course, it was too wild. We have now won four out of five games, which is a great statistic. It is also important to focus on the positive things. If you go to the ball and want to catch it, it's a very delicate process (regarding the disallowed Heidenheim goal in the first half). Even if there is only a small touch on the arms, you can no longer hold the ball. He hits my arms, so it has to be a foul.”",

    "fullText": "Braces: Serhou Guirassy had by far the most shots of all players (seven) and also contested the most duels (29). He celebrated his seventh and eighth goals of the season and is now out on his own as top scorer for the Black & Yellows (Maximilian Beier follows in second place with six goals). Guirassy bagged his second brace of the Bundesliga season, having previously managed the feat on Matchday 2 in the 3-0 home win against Union Berlin. He did, however, miss a chance for a hat-trick to seal the game, firing over the bar from the penalty spot. In five games against Heidenheim, he has found the back of the net five times.\n\nWelcome: 1. FC Heidenheim are the only current Bundesliga team against which Borussia Dortmund have never lost (four wins, two draws).\n\nThree goals: BVB once again scored exactly three goals in the fifth league game in 2026.\n\nImpressive return: 45 points after 20 match days are still BVB’s best return in seven years.\n\nPlenty of penalties: For the first time in almost exactly two years, BVB were awarded two penalty kicks in a Bundesliga match. On 28 January 2024, Niclas Füllkrug scored both against Bochum.\n\nMr 100 percent: Waldemar Anton won each of his six duels in the first half and scored his first home goal for BVB.\n\nA threat from set pieces: The 1-0 was the fifth BVB goal from a corner this season.\n\nOne hundred: Nico Schlotterbeck played his 100th Bundesliga match for Borussia Dortmund. He has also played 49 games for SC Freiburg, and a further 16 for Union Berlin.\n\nTwo hundred: Gregor Kobel completed his 200th competitive game for BVB. The 28-year-old Swiss moved from VfB Stuttgart to the Borsigplatz in 2021.\n\nTwice: Filippo Mane was named in the BVB starting lineup for the second time in just four days – first in the Champions League, and today in the Bundesliga (fourth overall appearance). The 20-year-old had previously only been in the starting formation for the first game of the season, when was sent off in the 3-3 draw at FC St. Pauli.",

    "title": "Adapting Europe's Urban Landscapes to Climate Change Through the Power of Nature",
    "description": "A multi-pronged approach to building climate resilience in cities.",
    "fullText": "The effects of climate change are here now, and cities in Europe and across the world are disproportionately feeling the consequences. As more people migrate to urban areas—by 2050, 70% of the world’s population will live in cities—the demand on urban systems will only increase. To solve these issues, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) spent five years developing innovative approaches that help cities adapt to and mitigate against the impacts of a changing climate.\n\nUrban greening, a nature-based solution implemented in cities, offers a tremendous opportunity to tackle the climate challenges that affect urban areas in an outsized way. Their benefits are numerous: from cleaning the air to easing the pressure on stormwater systems to providing habitat that promotes biodiversity and ecological balance. There’s also a direct impact on human wellbeing: urban greening provides areas for relaxation, exercise and social interaction, while simultaneously reducing temperatures to keep cities livable in the face of climate change.\n\nThe funding, skills and capacity needed to implement these solutions can be challenging, yet city governments, local businesses and communities are clamouring \n\nTNC chose Germany as the site for these projects because cities across the country were eager to engage in urban greening efforts, even though they often lacked the municipal resources to do so. Ultimately, TNC and local partners co-created three bodies of work that demonstrate the power of city involvement in finding effective, scalable, nature-based solutions to mitigate the dual challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\nCharlottenburg-Wilmersdorf District, Berlin\n\nTNC formed a strategic partnership with the Environmental and Nature Conservation Office in Berlin’s Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf District in 2020.  Significant funding from TNC allowed the partners to jointly create a new staff position to provide scientific support, project planning and implementation throughout the project. A focal point of the partnership was creating a districtwide Greenprint, a tool that reveals the range of opportunities for urban greening and benefits provided by natural infrastructure when incorporated into community planning.\n\nIn Stuttgart, TNC tested a new funding model for urban nature-based solutions that brought together multiple stakeholders from different sectors. Leveraging a €10 million Climate Innovation Fund that the City launched to support net-zero projects by public, private and nonprofit groups, TNC partnered with the Stuttgart municipal government to create a dedicated funding line for urban greening projects.\n\nThe goal was to create a financial incentive that would be open to any sector, including for-profit and start-up companies, helping to overcome the incentive gap barrier and accelerate the creation of nature-based solutions for the City. Given Stuttgart’s history of being a site of technological innovation, there was also a focus on the potential creation of an innovative, scalable approach that could continue to replicate on its own in the future. In total, 19 projects were developed.\n\nPartnership with Environmental Action Germany\n\nAs climate change continues to elevate temperatures in urban areas, sensitive age groups such as children and the elderly, as well as socioeconomically disadvantaged segments, bear the brunt of these challenges. TNC and partner Environmental Action Germany (Deutsche Umwelthilfe - DUH) collaborated to understand how urban greening can address these impacts. They focused on transforming urban areas, including school campuses, into valuable ecological and climate-resilient areas that simultaneously tackle the growing issue of urban heat, lack of biodiversity and the need for more nature-based solutions in the most densely populated urban areas.\n\nTNC and DUH collaboratively created Woods 'R' Us to address the health impacts of climate change on children. This program transforms German schoolyards, typically composed of concrete-heavy open spaces with little shade and few natural elements, into green spaces rich in biodiversity, adaptive to the climate and offer shade that cleans and cools the air. The program, which also focuses on introducing students to the wonders of nature, included:\n\nWhen paired together, these pilots become a powerful, multi-pronged approach to climate change that can serve as a template for others looking to implement nature-based solutions in the future. Over the course of the five-year program, TNC gained key insights that municipalities and stakeholders can apply in their own communities:\n\nThere is a gap between thinkers and doers: policymakers and planners often have more freedom to innovate, while those implementing and maintaining work face more constraints, leading to bottlenecks for new nature-based solutions.\n\nSecuring political backing is crucial, and science and research can help underpin effective policy and decision-making.\n\nInnovation funds, which can be replicated in other municipalities, face the challenge of securing necessary funding.\n\nEngagement from NGOs and the third sector is essential. They can close the gap by supporting public sector work, advocating for policy changes, facilitating experimentation, partnering with the private sector to change business practices, and helping bridge divides.\n\nBerlin’s Mierendorff Island Climate Adaptation Greenprint",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has boasted about strengthening the US economy since returning to the Oval Office. Meanwhile, millions of Americans say they're struggling to afford food, rent, and other basic necessities.\n\nGary Cohn, Trump's former chief economic advisor, said both these realities are true right now in America.\n\n\"If you look at gross domestic product, which is the overall output of the US economy, we're trending about 5% right now, which is a very high growth rate in the United States,\" Cohn said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nCohn, who is now IBM's vice chairman, also cited promising trends in inflation and unemployment rates.\n\nHowever, those numbers don't give the whole picture.\n\n\"That said, we've got an interesting economy,\" Cohn said. \"We have a massive wealth effect at the top end, and we have got hardworking Americans having a very difficult time paying their bills, and they are suffering in this economy.\"\n\nThat's why, Cohn said, the Trump administration is making affordability a key issue going forward.\n\n\"The White House is going on the offensive. The president is going to spend time out on the road talking about affordability,\" Cohn said. \"Affordability will be the issue between now and the mid-term elections.\"\n\nThe widening gap between wealthy and lower-income Americans is often described as a \"K-shaped economy.\" That's when people at the top see profound economic growth, while those at the bottom, who are more sensitive to economic shifts, face financial stress. Some economists have cautioned that a K-shaped economy portends bad days ahead.\n\n\"A silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,\" Gregory Daco, a chief economist at EY, said in a recent LinkedIn post. \"Slower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median, and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.\"\n\nThe chief economist of RSM, Joe Brusuelas, said in a recent briefing that the US would need to undergo policy shifts to reshape the economy, but that likely won't happen in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" he said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"",

    "description": "A lifelong skier shares how teaching her husband and kids to ski took years of effort, frustration, and patience before it paid off.",
    "fullText": "I grew up skiing. As in, we lived in the mountains and skied every weekend of winter, kind of thing.\n\nAt one point, early in our relationship, my husband looked at me, semi-astonished: \"I think you're better on skis than feet.\" So it was reaaaally important to me that, first, my then fiancé (now husband) and I could share this amazing sport together, and second, that when my kids were old enough, they too would know the awkward joys of being thrown off a J-bar.\n\nBut before we could cruise the groomers as a family, we had to get through many painful winters learning to ski.\n\nI thought I could teach my husband. The problem was that what comes naturally to someone who's been doing it all her life is really hard to put into words for someone who, well, grew up in urban Chicago.\n\nBut we tried! We rented skis and hit the bunny hills, specifically at a small Midwest ski resort called \"Alpine Valley.\" What could go wrong?\n\nMy husband is athletic and approached skiing with the confidence of someone who is good at every sport he tries. Until he skied. As we crested the ridge of the first hill, it all happened in a millisecond.\n\nUnable to put my weak \"pizza pie!\" lessons into action, he immediately spun wildly out of control, barreling straight down the mountain, one ski and one pole in the air, screaming \"stop, stop, stop!\" until he eventually did, hitting a fluorescent orange snowmaking turbine with such force that it slowly whirred to life. By the time I got to him, he was already throwing his skis over his shoulders and walking. \"You know how you don't play basketball?\" He screamed at me. \"Maybe I just don't ski!\"\n\nNot the best start to our alpine life together.\n\nWe needed a few no-ski winters after that one. But eventually, we tried again, this time with calculated professional intervention. We headed to our home mountain (Sunapee) and enlisted the help of a calm, 65-year-old pro with lovely, encouraging-grandpa vibes. As the pair clomped into the lodge at the end of a long Saturday, they were both beaming. \"He can ski!\" said the instructor.\n\nKids, it turns out, are much harder (and more expensive) to offload. My strategy with them was to put in sheer hours on the hill. The only way out is through, kind of thing. Sacrificing gorgeous bluebird ski days and many, many hundreds of dollars' worth of adult lift tickets to cold, crabby ingrates between my skis.\n\nEventually, they got the hang of it. And eventually, I got my ski-family wish.\n\nThat first cruiser we did as a full family — it was bliss. Big wedge turns, ear-to-ear smiles, singing at the top of their lungs. Truly, all is worth it. Now my husband skis as well as I do, and both kids leave us in the dust. But that's the way of the world.",

    "description": "Europe fears it can't beat Russia's style of war — creating a golden opportunity for defense founders.",
    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million to license the documentary and an additional docuseries on Prime Video. Brett Ratner, known for the \"Rush Hour\" franchise before sexual misconduct allegations derailed his career in 2017, directed the documentary.\n\n\"With exclusive footage of critical meetings, private conversations, and never-before-seen environments, 'Melania' showcases Mrs. Trump's return to one of the world's most powerful roles,\" an Amazon press release said.\n\nDespite the early box-office sales, the film has earned less-than-stellar reviews from critics and was review-bombed on Letterboxd. Business Insider's Peter Kafka described the documentary as \"dull,\" but said that it could resonate with superfans of the Trump family.\n\n\"The best way I can describe this one is something akin to a wedding video: Maybe the subjects of the video will want to watch it (Melania looks, unsurprisingly, like a woman who used to be a model; her husband seems notably more spry than he does now, a year after it was filmed),\" Kafka wrote. \"It's hard to imagine anyone else will.\"",

    "description": "\"I should spend more time at home, but there's so much to see and do and people to meet that I have a hard time staying home,\" Bill Strayer said.",
    "fullText": "When Bill Strayer first dreamed about moving to Asia, Japan was always the goal.\n\nBorn in Colorado, Strayer went to college in Missouri and later moved to the Bay Area to work in tech. There, work trips across Asia introduced him to cultures he hadn't encountered growing up.\n\nAs an adult, he participated in a homestay program in Japan three times, living with local families.\n\n\"That's what really kicked me into gear for being in Japan,\" Strayer, 63, told Business Insider. \"I studied Japanese, I watched Japanese movies, I listened to Japanese music. I made 14 trips to Japan.\"\n\nAs his career evolved, Strayer accepted a role at a financial services company that eventually brought him to Hawaii.\n\n\"My company had a branch office in Honolulu. I thought, well, Honolulu is kind of on the way to Japan. I'll just stay in Hawaii for two, three years and then eventually make it to Japan,\" Strayer said.\n\nWhat was meant to be a brief stop in Hawaii turned into 24 years, and the move to Japan never materialized.\n\nInstead, Strayer left his job as a portfolio advisor after a few years and eventually started a new chapter in aviation, first flying cargo and later transporting hotel guests between Hawaiian islands.\n\nAnd when it finally came time for him to retire, he moved to Bangkok instead.\n\nWhile Strayer was living in Hawaii, the timing never seemed right for a move to Japan — in his 30s, retirement still felt far off. And his mother had moved to Hawaii full time after years of being a snowbird.\n\nA two-week vacation through Southeast Asia in the early 2000s shifted his attention away from Japan. With just a day and a half in Bangkok, Thailand's capital, he hired a driver to show him around — and fell in love with the city immediately.\n\n\"This is so awesome,\" Strayer said, recalling his reaction. \"So I said, OK, next year I'm spending the whole two weeks in Bangkok. That's what kicked it off.\"\n\nEvery year after that, he would spend his two weeks of vacation in Thailand, learning more about the culture and its people. Over time, a realization set in: Japan was a place he loved to visit, but Thailand felt like somewhere he could actually live, especially since he wasn't a fan of cold weather.\n\n\"There's an extra point for Thailand; I'm not going to see a flake of snow,\" he said.\n\nAfter his mother died in 2021, Strayer decided to move forward with his plans. \"There was no real reason for me to be in Hawaii anymore,\" he said.\n\nAfter retiring from his aviation job in October 2022 and applying for a retirement visa, he returned to Bangkok in May 2023.\n\nStrayer is part of a wider trend of people relocating to Thailand. Bangkok, in particular, has long been a hot spot for expats.\n\nThere were 102,189 foreigners living in the city at the end of 2024, according to the latest Thai government data.\n\nStrayer spent two weeks living in a hotel while looking for an apartment. With the help of a real estate agent, he found a two-bedroom condo about 20 minutes from the city center. Rent is 30,000 Thai baht monthly, or about $950, and he is now in his third year there.\n\nHis furnished apartment is close to the Bangkok Skytrain, making it easy for him to get around.\n\nWith a city so accessible, Strayer has found no shortage of things to do. A typical day starts with a light breakfast, followed by a workout at his apartment complex, before heading out for lunch.\n\n\"I don't cook, because there's so much wonderful food out there on my doorstep that is inexpensive and delicious, far better than I could ever do,\" he said.\n\nA self-described foodie, he enjoys exploring new restaurants, and much of his social circle has grown out of those visits. One of his go-to spots is a small, traditional Thai restaurant that serves home-style dishes.\n\n\"I know the staff, they know me. Sometimes we get together outside of their work and stuff like that. That's been fantastic,\" Strayer said.\n\nMany of his days end with a visit to one of Bangkok's sky bars, where he watches the sunset.\n\n\"I've made it a mission to try to visit as many as I can,\" he said. \"No need to drink alcohol or anything like that, but just go ahead and hang out.\"\n\nEven in retirement, Strayer hasn't fully slowed down. He's been trading the US stock market since the 1990s and still wakes up between 2 and 4 a.m. to do it.\n\nHe's also built a small circle of expat friends in the city, including a Canadian retiree he met at the gym and another he connected with through YouTube, bonded by a shared interest in the stock market.\n\n\"I should spend more time at home, but there's so much to see and do and people to meet that I have a hard time staying home,\" Strayer added.\n\nHe continues to travel between Bangkok and Honolulu about three times a year, mostly to visit friends. But he doesn't see himself returning to Hawaii permanently — at least not for now.\n\n\"I would not have this much fun in the US. I can tell you that right now,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city? Contact this reporter at agoh@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policymakers debated mounting price pressures from a weak yen, with some warning of the risk of being \"behind the curve\" in dealing with too-high inflation, a summary of opinions at their January meeting showed on Monday.\n\n\"If overseas interest rate environments change this year, there is a risk that the bank may unintentionally fall behind the curve,\" one member was quoted as saying, calling for the need to keep pulling Japan’s real interest rates out of negative territory.\n\nWhile the risk of the BOJ falling behind the curve has not necessarily become evident, it is becoming more important to raise rates in a timely fashion, another opinion said.\n\nAt the January 22-23 meeting, the BOJ kept interest rates steady at 0.75%, having just hiked borrowing costs to the level in December. But the central bank retained its hawkish inflation forecasts and signaled readiness to keep raising still-low borrowing costs.",

    "description": "Set up automatic API key rotation for OpenRouter using Infisical. Complete guide for secure key management and zero-downtime rotation.",
    "fullText": "Infisical is a secrets management platform that helps teams securely store, sync, and rotate secrets across their infrastructure. With Infisical’s OpenRouter integration, you can automatically rotate your API keys on a schedule, ensuring your credentials stay secure with zero-downtime rotation.\n\nBefore setting up API key rotation, you’ll need an OpenRouter Provisioning API key. Provisioning keys are special keys used only for key management operations (create, list, delete keys) and cannot be used for model completion requests.\n\nNavigate to OpenRouter Settings and go to the Provisioning API Keys section. Click Create New Key, complete the key creation flow, and copy the generated Provisioning API key. Store it securely as you’ll need it when creating the Infisical connection.\n\nThe first step is to create an OpenRouter connection in Infisical that will be used to manage your API keys.\n\nIn your Infisical dashboard, navigate to Organization Settings and then App Connections (or the App Connections page in your project). Click Add Connection and choose OpenRouter from the list of available connections.\n\nComplete the form with your OpenRouter Provisioning API Key from the previous step, an optional description, and a name for the connection (for example, “openrouter-production”). After clicking Create, Infisical validates the key against OpenRouter’s API and your connection is ready to use.\n\nFor detailed instructions with screenshots, see Infisical’s OpenRouter Connection documentation.\n\nOnce your connection is set up, you can configure automatic API key rotation.\n\nNavigate to your Secret Manager Project’s Dashboard in Infisical and select Add Secret Rotation from the actions dropdown. Choose the OpenRouter API Key option.\n\nSet up how and when your keys should rotate:\n\nAuto-Rotation Enabled controls whether keys rotate automatically on the interval. Turn this off to rotate only manually or to pause rotation temporarily.\n\nRotate At specifies the local time of day when rotation runs once the interval has elapsed.\n\nRotation Interval sets the interval in days after which a rotation is triggered.\n\nOpenRouter Connection selects the connection (with a Provisioning API key) that will create and delete API keys during rotation.\n\nConfigure the properties of the rotated API keys:\n\nKey name is the display name for the key in OpenRouter (required).\n\nLimit sets an optional spending limit in USD for this key.\n\nLimit reset determines how often the limit resets: daily, weekly, or monthly.\n\nInclude BYOK in limit is an optional setting that controls whether usage from your own provider keys (Bring Your Own Key) counts toward this key’s spending limit. When disabled, only OpenRouter credits are counted. When enabled, BYOK usage is included in the limit.\n\nSpecify the secret name where the rotated API key will be stored. This is the name of the secret in Infisical where the rotated API key value will be accessible.\n\nGive your rotation a name and optional description, then review your configuration and click Create Secret Rotation. Your OpenRouter API Key rotation is now active. The current API key is available as a secret at the mapped path, and rotations will create a new key, switch the active secret to it, then revoke the previous key for zero-downtime rotation.\n\nFor the complete API reference and additional options, see Infisical’s OpenRouter API Key Rotation documentation.\n\nBYOK (Bring Your Own Key) on OpenRouter lets you use your own provider API keys (such as OpenAI or Anthropic) so you pay providers directly while OpenRouter charges a small fee on those requests.\n\nThe Include BYOK in limit option controls whether BYOK usage counts toward your key’s spending limit. When disabled, only OpenRouter credit usage counts toward the limit and BYOK usage is tracked separately. When enabled, usage from your own provider keys is included in the limit, and once the limit is reached, the key is subject to OpenRouter’s rate limits until the next reset.",

    "fullText": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock futures edged lower on Sunday evening as investors turned cautious ahead of a packed week of corporate earnings and economic data, following a pullback in technology shares that was triggered by Microsoft’s results last week.\n\nS&P 500 Futures inched 0.2% lower to 6,955.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.3% to 25,607.75 points by 19:36 ET (01:36 GMT). Dow Jones Futures traded 0.1% lower at 48,984.0 points.\n\nU.S. equities ended last week in the red, with the NASDAQ Composite leading losses as investors reassessed lofty expectations around artificial intelligence spending and returns.\n\nSentiment was dented after Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings update last week, which, while showing continued revenue growth, failed to fully reassure markets about the near-term payoff from heavy investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nThe results weighed on broader technology stocks and revived concerns that big-ticket AI spending may take longer to translate into profits.\n\nAmplifying concerns, a Wall Street Journal report over the weekend said that Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) proposed investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI has stalled after internal concerns were raised at the chipmaker\n\nAttention now shifts to earnings from other megacap technology firms, which are expected further shape market direction. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is due to report results on Tuesday, with investors closely watching advertising trends, cloud growth, and commentary on AI-related capital expenditure.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will follow on Thursday, with focus on performance at its Amazon Web Services cloud unit and margins in its core retail business.\n\nBeyond earnings, markets are also digesting political and policy developments. President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh as his nominee for Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nInvestors are weighing what a Warsh-led Fed could mean for interest rates, inflation control, and the balance between growth and financial stability, at a time when markets remain sensitive to policy signals.\n\nEconomic data later in the week could further influence rate expectations. The U.S. January employment report, due on Friday, is expected to show steady job growth and a stable unemployment rate.",

    "description": "Researchers have discovered a hidden quantum geometry inside materials that subtly steers electrons, echoing how gravity warps light in space. Once thought to exist only on paper, this effect has now been observed experimentally in a popular quantum material. The finding reveals a new way to understand and control how materials conduct electricity and interact with light. It could help power future ultra-fast electronics and quantum technologies.",
    "fullText": "How can information move at incredible speeds, or electricity flow without wasting energy? Answering these questions has pushed scientists and technology companies toward quantum materials, whose behavior is governed by physics at the smallest scales. Building these advanced materials depends on understanding how atoms and electrons behave, an area where many mysteries remain.\n\nNow, researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), working with colleagues at the University of Salerno and the CNR-SPIN Institute (Italy), have made a significant breakthrough. They identified a previously unseen geometric feature inside a quantum material that alters how electrons move, in a way similar to how gravity bends light. The findings, published in Science, point to new possibilities for next-generation quantum electronics.\n\nModern technologies rely on materials with extraordinary performance, many of which arise from quantum physics. This field focuses on matter at microscopic scales, where particles behave in surprising ways. Over the past century, research into atoms, electrons, and photons led to the invention of transistors and the foundation of today's computers.\n\nEven now, scientists continue to uncover quantum effects that challenge established theories. Recent research suggests that when huge numbers of particles interact inside certain materials, a kind of internal geometry can emerge. This structure can redirect electron motion, closely resembling how Einstein's theory of gravity describes the bending of light.\n\nFrom Mathematical Idea to Measured Reality\n\nThis internal structure is known as the quantum metric. It describes the curvature of the quantum space through which electrons travel and influences many microscopic properties of materials. Despite its importance, proving its existence experimentally has been extremely difficult.\n\n''The concept of quantum metric dates back about 20 years, but for a long time it was regarded purely as a theoretical construct. Only in recent years have scientists begun to explore its tangible effects on the properties of matter,'' explains Andrea Caviglia, full professor and director of the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science.\n\nDetecting a Hidden Geometry in Quantum Materials\n\nIn the new study, the research team led by UNIGE, together with Carmine Ortix, associate professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Salerno, detected the quantum metric at the boundary between two oxide materials, strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate. This interface is already known as a powerful platform for studying quantum behavior.\n\n''Its presence can be revealed by observing how electron trajectories are distorted under the combined influence of quantum metric and intense magnetic fields applied to solids,'' explains Giacomo Sala, research associate in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and lead author of the study.\n\nImplications for Future Technologies\n\nBeing able to observe this effect allows scientists to measure a material's optical, electronic, and transport properties more accurately. The team also found that the quantum metric is a fundamental characteristic of many materials, rather than a rare exception as previously believed.\n\n''These discoveries open up new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum geometry in a wide range of materials, with major implications for future electronics operating at terahertz frequencies (a trillion hertz), as well as for superconductivity and light-matter interactions,'' concludes Andrea Caviglia.\n\nMaterials provided by Université de Genève.

    "fullText": "Second T20 international, Pallekele\n\nSri Lanka 189-5 (20.0 overs): Rathnayake 40 (22); Archer 2-42, Jacks 1-24\n\nEngland 173-4 (16.4 overs): Banton 54* (33), Buttler 39 (29); Pathirana 2-47\n\nEngland won by six wickets runs; lead three-match series 2-0\n\nTom Banton whacked an unbeaten half-century as England pulled off a brilliant DLS chase to beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the second T20 international.\n\nThe players had gone off for rain with England 57-2 off 7.2 overs - Phil Salt and Jacob Bethell the batters out - and when they returned the tourists were set a revised DLS target of 168 off 17 overs.\n\nJos Buttler laid the platform with a 29-ball 39 but Harry Brook truly gave England belief during a brutal and breathtaking cameo in Pallekele.\n\nBrook spanked four sixes during a knock of 36 off 12 balls as he seized the initiative only to be caught scooping the slingy Matheesha Pathirana.\n\nWith 38 runs off 33 balls required, Banton played with calculated aggression en route to 54 not out off 33 balls to put England on the brink of victory.\n\nThe match went down to the final over but Sam Curran duly cracked Janith Liyanage for six to wrap up the win with two balls to spare.\n\nSri Lanka had earlier posted a competitive 189-5 after being inserted by England as Pavan Rathnayake top scored with 40 off 22 balls.\n\nPathum Nissanka had set the tone after he and fellow opener Kamil Mishara hammered 35 off the first two overs of the match.\n\nHowever, England's spinners stymied the hosts' attacking intent with controlled spells through the middle overs as Adil Rashid, Liam Dawson and Will Jacks all picked up a wicket apiece.\n\nJofra Archer claimed 2-42 but fellow seamers Jamie Overton and Curran were both expensive and wicketless.\n\nEngland's victory ensured they clinched the series 2-0 with one match left to play before their opening game of the T20 World Cup against Nepal on 8 February.\n\nBanton burst on to the international scene for England in 2019 with some eye-catching performances as a 21-year-old.\n\nA blur of flamboyant strokeplay and powerful ball striking, he was perhaps found wanting when it came to consistency, especially in his previous guise opening.\n\nThere were question marks as to whether he could hack it when under pressure while injuries also checked his progress.\n\nAt the age of 27, and in England's middle order, the Somerset man looks a much more rounded player at home on the global stage.\n\nThis was an innings of tempered aggression and one which was the glue that bound England's chase together.\n\nBanton swept and reverse swept quite beautifully against Sri Lanka's spinners, striking four fours and three sixes.\n\nHe also knew when to play second fiddle - while Brook was going berserk, for example - which showed useful situational awareness.\n\n\"You've got to give yourself a chance to get out there and assess the wicket,\" Banton said at the post-match presentation.\n\n\"Where there's a bit of hold and turn, it's essential to be able to sweep the ball. The Sri Lankan spinners keep it nice and straight so you've got to hit it.\"\n\nHis chance here came courtesy of Ben Duckett nursing a finger injury and England will now have a decision to make for the World Cup.\n\nAnother decent outing in the final T20 on Tuesday and it could be Banton's place in the middle to lose.\n\n\"I think most of my career I've been opening. I've got a new role with England which is exciting,\" Banton added.\n\n\"I just want to try and play all formats and hopefully take my chance when I get it.\"\n\nEncouragingly for England on the eve of a subcontinental T20 World Cup, their spin department is holding up well.\n\nA combined 12 overs yielded three wickets for 81 runs at an economy rate of 6.75, a return that underlined their growing control and reliability.\n\nRashid remains the ace in the pack, capable of stifling momentum and producing breakthroughs at key moments.\n\nThe experienced leg-spinner's googly may have been well studied by opposition batters, but it remains a potent weapon, as Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka discovered when he was trapped lbw slogging to leg.\n\nDawson's left-arm spin provided much-needed control through the middle overs, slowing down his speeds to left vs right handers, while Jacks continues to mature as a bowling option, and used his angles well.\n\nBrook has plenty of options to turn to even when the pitch does not spin big.\n\nA slight concern for England, with just under a week to go before a major tournament, was that their seam bowling did not quite hit the mark.\n\nThat caveat comes with the acknowledgement that the surface at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium was a used one, offering little margin for error.\n\nNevertheless Jamie Overton struggled with his length, while Curran, fresh from an expensive hat-trick in the opening T20, surprisingly lacked conviction after conceding 14 from his first over.\n\nArcher fared slightly better, picking up two wickets despite being targeted early on, with Nissanka launching him out of the ground in his opening over.\n\nArcher, however, recovered well to bowl effectively at the death as Sri Lanka pushed for a total in excess of 200.\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"I thought we played outstanding there, especially with the bat. To win the series is awesome.\n\n\"I think the more time we get out in the middle puts us into good shape for the World Cup. The way Banton played there was great. There's plenty of batters in there. We just go out there and chase.\n\n\"The spinners have been awesome, that's why we decided to pick two frontline spinners, to help restrict those runs in the middle.\"\n\nSri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka: \"We did a lot of things right. It's not the rain, but the fact that Eshan Malinga got injured played a part. Normally he's a very good death bowler but we lost him so there's a reason [for the loss].\n\n\"Every batter got starts so happy about the way they played and accelerated. There were a few overs where we couldn't capitalise but Adil Rashid bowled well.\n\n\"We know that because we've played on spin tracks the past two years. It's the home advantage so no doubt about it we need to use that.\"\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "Yann LeCun, an A.I. Pioneer, Warns the Tech 'Herd' Could Hit a Dead End",
    "description": "Yann LeCun helped create the technology behind today’s chatbots. Now he says many tech companies are on the wrong path to creating intelligent machines.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his 40-year career as a computer scientist, Yann LeCun has earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and a man with a penchant for throwing verbal grenades.\n\nHe was one of three pioneering researchers who received the Turing Award, often called “the Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on the technology that is now the foundation for modern A.I. For more than a decade, he also served as chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut after leaving Meta in November, Dr. LeCun has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Silicon Valley’s single-minded approach to building intelligent machines. He argues that the technology industry will eventually hit a dead end in its A.I. development — after years of work and hundreds of billions of dollars spent.\n\nThe reason, he said, goes back to what he has argued for years: Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the A.I. technology at the heart of popular products like ChatGPT, can get only so powerful. And companies are throwing everything they have at projects that won’t get them to their goal to make computers as smart as or even smarter than humans. More creative Chinese companies, he added, could get there first.\n\n“There is this herd effect where everyone in Silicon Valley has to work on the same thing,” he said during a recent interview from his home in Paris. “It does not leave much room for other approaches that may be much more promising in the long term.”\n\nThat critique is the latest shot in a debate that has roiled the tech industry since OpenAI sparked the A.I. boom in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT: Is it possible to create so-called artificial general intelligence or even more powerful superintelligence? And can companies get there using their current technology and concepts?\n\nFew scientists have as much history with the topic as Dr. LeCun, 65. Much of what the tech industry is trying to do now has its roots in an idea that he has nurtured since the 1970s. As a young engineering student in Paris, he embraced a concept called neural networks, even though most researchers thought the idea was hopeless.\n\nNeural networks are mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. At the time, they had no practical use. But a decade later, when he was a researcher at Bell Labs, Dr. LeCun and his colleagues showed that these systems could learn to read handwriting scribbled on envelopes or personal checks.\n\nNot long after ChatGPT was released, the two researchers who received the 2018 Turing Award with Dr. LeCun warned that A.I. was growing too powerful. Those scientists even warned that the technology could threaten the future of humanity. Dr. LeCun argued that was absurd.\n\n“There was a lot of noise around the idea that A.I. systems were intrinsically dangerous and that putting them in the hands of everyone was a mistake,” he said. “But I have never believed in this.”\n\nDr. LeCun also helped push Meta and its rivals to freely share their research through academic-style papers and so-called open source technologies.\n\nAs more people said A.I. could be a threat of some sort to humans, a number of companies curtailed their open source efforts. But Meta kept going. Dr. LeCun repeatedly argued that open source was the safest path. It meant that no one company would control the technology and that anyone could use these systems to identify and fight potential risks.\n\nNow as a number of companies, including Meta, appear to be moving away from that method because they want an edge over their rivals and continue to worry about dangerous uses, Dr. LeCun is warning that American companies could lose their lead to Chinese rivals that are still using open source.\n\n“This is a disaster,” he said. “If everyone is open, the field as a whole progresses faster.”\n\nMeta’s A.I. work ran into a snag last year. After outside researchers criticized the company’s latest technology, Llama 4, and accused Meta of misrepresenting the power of the system, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, spent billions on a new research lab dedicated to the pursuit of “superintelligence” — a hypothetical A.I. system that exceeds the powers of the human brain.\n\nSix months after the creation of the new lab, Dr. LeCun left Meta to build his own start-up, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, or AMI Labs.\n\nEven though his research laid the groundwork for L.L.M.s, Dr. LeCun argued that they were not the final answer to A.I. development. The problem with current systems, he said, is that they do not plan ahead. Trained solely on digital data, they do not have a way of understanding difficulties in the real world.\n\n“L.L.M.s are not a path to superintelligence or even human-level intelligence. I have said that from the beginning,” he said. “The entire industry has been L.L.M.-pilled.”\n\nDuring his last several years at Meta, Dr. LeCun worked on technology that tried to predict the outcome of its actions. That, he said, would allow A.I. to progress beyond the status quo. His new start-up will continue that work.\n\n“This type of system can plan what it is going to do,” he said. “Current systems — L.L.M.s — absolutely cannot do that.”\n\nPart of Dr. LeCun’s argument is that today’s A.I. systems make too many mistakes. As they tackle more complex tasks, he argued, mistakes pile up like cars after a collision on a highway.\n\nBut over the last several years, these systems have steadily improved. And in recent months, the latest models, which are designed to “reason” through questions, have continued to improve in areas like math, science and computer programming.\n\n“These models do make mistakes. But we have shown that a system can try many different options — in its own head, so to speak — before settling on a final answer,” said Rayan Krishnan, the chief executive of Vals AI, a company that tracks the performance of the latest A.I. technologies.\n\n“Progress is not slowing down. It has become clear that language models can take on new tasks and continue to get better at doing everything we want them to do,” he said.\n\nSubbarao Kambhampati, an Arizona State University professor who has been an A.I. researcher nearly as long as Dr. LeCun, agreed that today’s technologies don’t provide a path to true intelligence. But he also pointed out that they were increasingly useful in highly lucrative areas like computer coding. Dr. LeCun’s newer methods, he added, are unproven.\n\nFor Dr. LeCun, that is why his new company is important. The last several decades, he said, are filled with A.I. projects that seemed like a way forward but ran out of steam. And Silicon Valley is not guaranteed to be the winner in this global race.\n\n“The good ideas are coming from China,” he said. “But Silicon Valley also has a superiority complex, so it can’t imagine that good ideas can come from other places.”",

Of the traditional big six, only Manchester City and Tottenham have been active, spending £84m and £48m respectively.\n\nIndeed, Antoine Semenyo's £63m switch from Bournemouth to City looks set to be comfortably the biggest deal done in the window.\n\nCity will be the biggest spenders for the second-consecutive January, having spent £188m 12 months ago on reinforcements that have had varying degrees of impact on the first-team. The £84m outlay on Semenyo and Marc Guehi edges them close to an eye-watering £450m spend in the last 12-month period.\n\nTottenham (£47.8m) and West Ham (£47m) follow next, the latter adding two centre-forwards to their ranks as they look to move out of the relegation zone.\n\nLiverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea have so far chosen to sit this one out, and that's been a prevailing theme for that quartet in January of late; Arsenal and Liverpool have not signed anyone at all in winter for three seasons now, while United's capture of Patrick Dorgu (£27m in 2025) has been their only business over that same period.\n\nChelsea signed Mathis Amougou (£13.5m) last January, otherwise they have transitioned to relying solely on summer business, too.",

Michael Carrick's post-match assessment summed up the view of many.\n\nBenjamin Sesko is entitled to the headlines after delivering the dramatic ending.\n\nBut when the dust settles on the 3-2 win over Fulham, United fans may start to look back further to Ruben Amorim's ill-fated 14 months in charge and wonder whether their club effectively wasted a year.\n\nAmorim presided over victories like this.\n\nThe 5-4 epic against Lyon in the Europa League last April was even more dramatic given it involved two goals in the final minute of extra time.\n\nGo back further and Carrick played in them. He was an injury-time substitute before Michael Owen scored his famous Manchester derby winner at Old Trafford in 2009.\n\n\"It's the best feeling,\" said Carrick.\n\n\"Some of the best moments here I've been lucky enough to be a part of, when you get a moment of elation and excitement like that.\n\n\"There's no better place, in front of the Stretford End - and it ends up meaning a bit more.\n\n\"People leave here with more than just a United win.

    "description": "Plus, how to whip up the best morning meal for your gut.",
    "fullText": "All of our meals and snacks affect our health on a short-term basis. When eaten regularly, they also impact our bodies (for better or worse) down the line. However, one gastroenterologist has a special love of breakfast, especially when it comes to his patients' gut health and his own.\n\n\"Think of your breakfast as the opening act for your gut's entire day,\" shares Dr. Rosario Ligresti, MD, the chief ofthe division of gastroenterology at Hackensack University Medical Center. \"What you eat first thing in the morning sets the stage for your digestive system's rhythm and your gut microbiome's activity.\"\n\nDr. Ligresti says well-balanced breakfasts stabilize blood sugar levels, prevent energy crashes and lower the odds that you'll get a hankering for less nutritious, sugary snacks later. Speaking of later, we're not fans of potty talk at the breakfast table. That said, good breakfast habits can lead to good bathroom habits, so you're less likely to get constipated.\n\n\"Essentially, a good breakfast habit tells your gut, 'We're starting the day strong and nourished,' which can lead to better energy, focus and overall digestive wellness throughout the day,\" he explains.\n\nWhat qualifies as a good breakfast, though? To help, Dr. Ligresti shares the one breakfast mistake he wishes people would stop making and delicious ways to break the habit.\n\n🩺\nDr. Ligresti wishes people would stop skipping or deprioritizing fiber and protein in the morning. \"Protein and fiber are the power couple of a gut-healthy breakfast, and I can't recommend them enough,\" he tells Parade.\n\nIndeed, fiber is getting billed as the new protein these days. However, trend forecasters can take a seat because there's plenty of room for both fiber and protein at the breakfast table. Unfortunately, many sugary cereals and other traditional breakfast foods are low in both of these nutrients, and that's a problem.\n\nLet's start with fiber. It's not a standalone macro nutrient like protein is, though complex carbohydrates like whole-wheat breads and pastas contain fiber. Regardless, fiber can have a macro effect on your overall health, especially your digestive tract. Fewer than 10% of Americans get enough fiber daily, though, and it's not doing their guts any good.\n\n\"When you consume fiber, it acts like a broom for your digestive tract, adding bulk to your stool, which helps with regularity and prevents constipation,\" Dr. Ligresti explains. \"Furthermore, certain fibers are prebiotics, meaning they are food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut, helping to create a diverse and thriving gut microbiome.\"\n\nWhether the spotlight on protein is on dimming remains to be seen. However, he hopes that people continue to prioritize the macronutrient every morning. \"Protein, on the other hand, is crucial for making you feel full and satisfied, which helps to curb overeating later in the day.\"\n\nIn short? Protein and fiber are not rivals. They are two of your gut's best friends.\n\n\"Having these two nutrients together at breakfast provides you with sustained energy, supports muscle health, and keeps your blood sugar stable for hours,\" Dr. Ligresti says.\n\nSpeaking of hours, they're at the heart of why many people don't get enough fiber and protein at breakfast. There simply aren't enough of them in the day. \"In our fast-paced lives, time is often the biggest reason people skip a nutrient-dense breakfast,\" he states. \"It's much quicker to grab a pastry, a sugary cereal, or just a cup of coffee on the way out the door.\"\n\nAs convenient and tasty as these options are, Dr. Ligresti explains they are low in protein and fiber and high in refined sugars and unhealthy fats. \"In the short term, these foods can cause a rapid spike and subsequent crash in your blood sugar, leading to fatigue and more cravings,\" he reports. \"They can also contribute to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and gas.\"\n\nOver time, he says eating these foods at breakfast or any time of day consistently might alter your gut microbiome, potentially leading to inflammation and a greater risk of developing other chronic health issues.\n\nReady to help your gut health rise with a breakfast that consistently shines? Dr. Ligresti shares three time-saving breakfasts rich in fiber and protein.\n\nGreek yogurt with berries and nuts. This easy-to-assemble breakfast idea is a win for your schedule and gut health. \"The Greek yogurt provides a fantastic source of protein, the berries are loaded with fiber and antioxidants, and the nuts add more fiber and healthy fats for sustained energy,\" he says.\n\nOatmeal with chia seeds and an apple. You definitely don't have to ditch all of the classics, especially not oatmeal. \"Oatmeal...is rich in soluble fiber, which is great for heart health and keeping you full,\" he says. \"I like to stir in some chia seeds for an extra boost of fiber and omega-3s, and top it with sliced apples for some sweetness and crunch.\"\n\nScrambled eggs with spinach on whole-wheat toast. Savory tooths, rejoice. \"The eggs are a complete protein, and adding spinach provides extra vitamins and fiber,\" Dr. Ligresti shares. \"Serving it on a slice of whole-wheat toast ensures you're getting that essential fiber to start your day right.\"\n\nGetting enough protein and fiber is a great first step toward better gut health. However, Dr. Ligresti shares that there are other important strategies to implement to keep your gut happy. He recommends:\n\nDr. Ligresti always tells patients to sip water throughout the day to help prevent constipation and support their overall gut health. \"Water is essential for helping fiber do its job of moving things smoothly through your digestive system,\" he says.\n\n\"Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut are rich in probiotics, which are live beneficial bacteria that can help support a healthy gut microbiome,\" he explains. If you don't normally consume these foods, he suggests starting with a small serving of one of these ideas each day.\n\nHe points out that there's a strong brain-gut connection, and chronically high stress can throw things out of whack. \"High levels of stress can negatively impact your digestion,\" Dr. Ligresti says. \"I encourage my patients to find a daily stress-reducing activity they enjoy, whether it's a short walk, meditation or simply reading a book.\"\n\nDr. Rosario Ligresti, MD, the chief ofthe division of gastroenterology at Hackensack University Medical Center\n\nClosing America’s Fiber Intake Gap.

The complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a misconduct complaint filed by the Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald Trump ’s administration over deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec. 19 by Jeffrey S. Sutton, chief judge of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but the order only came to light this weekend.\n\nThe complaint stemmed from remarks that Boasberg, the chief judge in the district court in the nation’s capital, allegedly made in March 2025 to Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges at a judicial conference saying the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings. The meeting took place days before Boasberg issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.\n\nIn the dismissal order, Sutton said the Justice Department never provided a listed attachment to provide proof of what Boasberg said or the context of the alleged statement at the closed-door conference.\n\n“A recycling of unadorned allegations with no reference to a source does not corroborate them. And a repetition of uncorroborated statements rarely supplies a basis for a valid misconduct complaint,\" said Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to the appeals court circuit that covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and for Boasberg's court did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nEven if Boasberg had made the comments, Sutton said it would not be “so far afield\" from topics discussed at the gathering and would not violate ethics rules. Sutton noted that Roberts' 2024 year-end report raised general concerns about threats to judicial independence, security concerns for judges and respect for court orders throughout the nation's history.\n\nThe misconduct complaint was filed with Judge Sri Srinivasan, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but Srinivasan asked Roberts to transfer it to another appeals court circuit because it was still considering appeals related to the deportation case, according to the dismissal order. Roberts transferred it to the 6th Circuit, it said.",

    "description": "“All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food.\"",
    "fullText": "Plastic pollution is an enormous global problem, and a lot of focus has been rightly placed on the devastating effects that plastic is having on our oceans and marine life. But plastic pollution on land is a big problem, too, as experts have recently been reminded when they started discovering giant blobs of the stuff inside the stomachs of dead camels.\n\nCalifornia-based environmental scientist Marcus Eriksen and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based veterinary microbiologist Ulrich Wernery co-authored an article titled \"The plight of camels eating plastic waste.\"\n\nEriksen described one autopsy as \"the most surreal thing in the world,\" and their findings showed that plastic clumps called polybezoars, which Eriksen said \"range from the size of a basketball to roughly a large suitcase,\" are responsible for 1% of the camel deaths in the UAE\n\n\"All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food,\" Eriksen said. \"If they see a plastic bag stuck in a tree … or stuck against a fence, they might think, 'Oh, that's a novel piece of food,' and they'll consume it.\"\n\nThe effects of eating plastic are devastating for the camels, causing intestinal blockages, creating lacerations inside their stomachs, and creating a toxic environment for bacteria to grow amid the folds of the plastic.\n\n\"It's a slow death,\" Eriksen said. \"Imagine if you had five plastic bags crushed up in your body, and maybe a dozen bottle caps and a few straws, and it stayed there for years. I mean, you would suffer until you'd ultimately perish from that ingested trash. And that's what the camels are experiencing.\"\n\nCamels are not the only land animals facing this challenge, either. A sick bear in Colorado was recently euthanized and found to have plastic waste blocking its digestive system. Plastic waste consumption also killed two elephants in Sri Lanka.\n\nAs plastic waste causes more and more animal deaths, there is some hope that public pressure will cause governments to regulate it more heavily. Canada banned single-use plastics in 2021, and other places, such as Massachusetts, have taken similar steps.\n\nAs far as steps we can take to reduce our plastic consumption in our regular lives, we can make sure we understand how to recycle as effectively as possible and shun single-use plastics by using things like reusable water bottles.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s jokes at an elite closed-door Washington, D.C., event bombed so badly that “the room fell silent repeatedly,” The Washington Post reported Sunday.\n\nThe awkwardness happened Saturday night at the Alfalfa Club dinner, an invitation-only event for some 200 of the rich and powerful who gather together each year on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s birthday.\n\nAccording to The Post, it was the first time Trump addressed the club, “speaking before a room whose membership includes such foes as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (whose bank he is suing), David Rubenstein (whom he fired as head of the Kennedy Center) and Jerome H. Powell (the outgoing Fed chairman whose role he is investigating).”\n\nAn anonymous source told The Post that some of Trump’s jokes “landed with a thud, and the room fell silent repeatedly.”\n\nTrump began his remarks by declaring, “So many people in the room I hate. Most of you I like,” Trump said, before adding, “Who in the hell thought this was going to happen?”\n\nTrump then warned the crowd that he might “cut the speech short” so he could watch “the invasion of Greenland,” before revealing that he was just joking.\n\n“We’re not going to invade Greenland. We’re going to buy it,” Trump said, according to the report. “It’s never been my intention to make Greenland the 51st state. I want to make Canada the 51st state. Greenland will be the 52nd state. Venezuela can be 53rd.”\n\nTrump dropped several off-color comments about his political adversaries, according to attendees. He described calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) “Pocahontas” in reference to her claims of Native American heritage. She was supposed to be at the dinner, he said, “but couldn’t find her reservation.” He mentioned that Condoleezza Rice was also in the audience and said he always thought she would be the first female president. “Never in a million years would I have thought Joe Biden would beat her to it,” he added, suggesting that former first lady Jill Biden was the true president in a barb that also appeared to bomb with guests.\n\nAfter the event, Trump flew to his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, FL, for White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino’s wedding, scheduled to be held Sunday.\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Bombed His Speech at Closed-Door Black Tie DC Dinner: ‘Jokes Landed With a Thud’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "If someone is a millionaire, there are usually signs beyond the number in their bank account. If you are trying to get on the wealth-building path to reach millionaire status, you may need to adopt habits, values and financial strategies that represent true wealth.\n\nMoving from aspiring to having actual riches takes noticeable shifts in your behavior around money management, especially when it comes to your spending and savings habits. Identifying these ways to edit is important because they show not just where financial success is possible but also a mindset that’s focused on lasting wealth creation.\n\nSimply put, if you’re looking for clues on how to be rich, you might want to do as a millionaire does. Here are some key signs you are making the financial decisions they would.\n\nA diversified investment portfolio is a hallmark of a millionaire. This portfolio typically extends beyond stocks and bonds, toward encompassing real estate, business ventures and perhaps alternative investments like art or private equity.\n\nWhen you are saving for retirement or a big-ticket item, diversification isn’t a random act of finance. It’s a strategic approach to spread risk and maximize returns by avoiding putting all of your nest eggs in one basket.\n\nRead Next: 5 Key Mindset Shifts To Financially Become the Top 1%, According to Humphrey Yang\n\nLearn More: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nAnother key sign of a millionaire is making strategic financial planning and investment decisions. Your goal isn’t just about saving money but rather creating a comprehensive roadmap for earning, saving, investing and spending. Millionaires understand that a well-thought-out financial strategy is crucial for wealth accumulation and preservation.\n\nRobust savings and substantial emergency funds are common among millionaires. They understand the importance of having a safety net that should have at least three to six months’ worth of expenses in it to cover you should something unexpected happen, such as medical bills or job loss.\n\nUnlike the average person, a millionaire’s emergency fund can cover a year or more of living expenses, ensuring financial stability even in unforeseen circumstances.\n\nMillionaires typically have a low debt-to-income ratio. This means they are cautious about borrowing and prioritize paying off debts quickly.\n\nThough this may seem easier for those not living paycheck to paycheck, someone comfortable with their finances tends to focus on accumulating assets, not liabilities, indicating a healthy approach to debt management.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nWhen I start working with a new senior client, the first exercise I introduce to them is the wall plank.\n\nThis simple exercise is great for strengthening the deepest muscles in our core, which are responsible for supporting the back and hips, maintaining proper posture, and stabilizing the entire body.\n\nAnd because muscle mass, bone density and balance all diminish as we age, having good deep core strength is all the more important for preventing injuries and falls.\n\nThe wall plank is appropriate for all fitness levels, easy to modify or progress, and safe to do every day. As long as you have a section of bare wall and a few minutes to spare, you can give wall planks a try.\n\nCheck in with your doctor before starting any new activity. A certified trainer can provide form guidance and exercise modification, if needed.\n\nStand facing a wall, position yourself about six inches away from it with your feet hip-width apart.\n\nLean forward and place your forearms against the wall, making sure your elbows, forearms and shoulders are aligned.\n\nYour body should form a straight line from your head to your feet, don’t allow your hips to pop back or sink towards the wall.\n\nGently push the muscles in your midsection out to engage your core muscles and keep them braced throughout.\n\nHold for the desired length of time.\n\nStart by holding the wall plank for 15 seconds, incrementally working your way up to 60 seconds over subsequent workouts. Beginners should aim to do one set of wall planks two to three times a week. Once you’ve built up the appropriate amount of strength, aim for two to three sets of wall planks, five to seven times a week.\n\nMake it easier: If this exercise feels tough, modify by placing your hands against the wall instead of your elbows, or by placing your feet closer to the wall.\n\nMake it harder: Make the exercise more challenging by walking your feet further away from the wall. Once you’re able to hold the wall plank for 60 seconds with good form, consider trying the plank on a lower elevated surface, like a chair or your bed.\n\nStandard planks performed lying face down on a yoga mat are one of the best exercises to target the transverse abdominis, a deep-lying muscle in the core that stabilizes and supports your spine and pelvis.\n\nDeep core strength is especially important for seniors, because age-related changes can jeopardize overall balance and stability.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries or mobility issues can make it difficult for many seniors to do exercises on the floor. Wall planks are done standing upright instead, engaging the transverse abdominis in a similar way to standard planks.",

    "fullText": "Argentine cherry growers are facing a challenging season with severe rain and hailstorms. Production and exports have fallen due to this change in climate. The damaged crop has threatened global food supplies and farmers' livelihoods.\n\nEurofruit reported that poor weather caused Argentine cherry shipments in the last quarter of 2025 to hit a low.\n\nPlanet protection agency SENASA confirmed that cherry shipments totaled 3,760 tonnes (over 4,100 tons). This is a 38% decrease from last year and 19% below the five-year average.\n\nThe \"sector [is] on course for its worst season since 2019,\" per the report.\n\nGrowers projected good-quality crops to exceed last year's totals.\n\nAccording to Eurofruit, rain and hailstorms damaged \"the main producing areas\" instead. Much of the crop went to the domestic market.\n\nShifts in export markets are also happening in the 2025/26 season. Despite the drop in volumes, the U.S. is becoming the top destination (36%), while China's share fell (26%).\n\nBad weather in Argentine cherry production indicates how an overheating planet impacts crops. Farming communities and importing countries rely on crops for food and to support their economies.\n\nFrequent extreme weather events, which have been increasing, damage agricultural yields.

    "fullText": "(refiles to fix hyperlinks in paragraph 8, 14)\n\nDUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's leadership warned of a regional conflict on Sunday if the U.S. were to attack it, stoking the tension between Washington and Tehran, and it ​designated EU armies as \"terrorist groups\" in a retaliatory move.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its naval presence in the ‌Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.\n\nDespite the ‌standoff between Iran's clerical rulers and the Trump administration, both sides have signalled they are ready to resume talks, and regional allies such as Turkey have sought de-escalation.\n\nAn Iranian official denied an earlier report by state-run Press TV that the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces would carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday and Monday, telling Reuters they have no such plan and the media ⁠reports are wrong.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ‌was quoted on state media as saying that although Trump says he has sent ships to the region, \"the Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred ‍by these threats\".\n\n\"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in ​the region, raising the risk of war after Iran's deadly crackdown in January on nationwide protests against Iranian leadership.\n\nTrump was weighing ‌options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces, Reuters has reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nOn Saturday Trump told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with Washington, hours after Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were underway.\n\nTrump also said: \"I hope they negotiate something acceptable. You could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTehran says it is ready for \"fair\" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe protests, which started over economic hardships but morphed ⁠into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its ​establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.\n\nOfficial numbers put the unrest-related death ​toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.\n\nIn a symbolic shift in response to ‍the crackdown on protests, the European ⁠Union on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn retaliation on Sunday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said EU armies would also be designated as such, and that authorities would deliberate on the expulsion of EU ⁠states' military attachés.\n\n\"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot\" the speaker told fellow lawmakers, who all wore IRGC ‌uniforms in support of the elite force.\n\nAfter his address, lawmakers shouted \"Death to America, Shame on you Europe\".",

    "description": "Warren Buffett isn't known for overcomplicating things—and when it comes to investing, he doesn't think you should either. At the 2008 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Buffett was asked, \"If you were 30 years old again and had your first million in the bank, how would you invest it assuming you're not a full-time investor, you have another full-time job, you can cover your expenses with other savings for about 18 months, and you have no dependents.\" \"I'll be very simple,\" he repli",

Buffett wasn't advising someone to watch the markets or make investing a second job. He was saying to get on with life. Keep earning. Let compound interest take the wheel. With steady income and decades ahead, the real advantage isn't perfect timing—it's not touching the money at all. When the plan is simple and automatic, the hardest part is knowing when to leave it alone.\n\nBuffett has long maintained that most investors shouldn't try to beat the market. It's not about intelligence—it's about realism. He doesn't just invest in companies—he buys entire businesses, with full access to management, operations, and long-term strategy. That's not something the average investor can replicate.\n\nInstead, he recommends simplicity and discipline. A low-cost index fund—like one that tracks the S&P 500—spreads your money across hundreds of large U.S. companies. There's no guesswork involved. You're not betting on the next Apple or Amazon. You're owning a slice of the entire market and letting it grow over time.\n\nTrending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\n\nAt Berkshire's 2020 shareholders meeting, Buffett doubled down on the same principle. \"I don't think most people are in a position to pick single stocks,\" he said. \"A few [are], maybe, but on balance, I think people are much better off buying a cross-section of America and just forgetting about it.\"",

    "fullText": "More than 5,200 members of the United Educators of San Francisco voted overwhelmingly to authorize the union’s leadership to call a strike as teachers push for more public education funding.\n\nThe union, which represents San Francisco Unified School District workers such as educators, nurses, counselors, and psychologists, voted in favor by 97.6% to pave the way for a potential strike.\n\n“Our community is standing with us in our fight for the consistent classroom teachers, special education supports, and stable programs our students and families need and deserve,” UESF wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.\n\nThe post said the school district was placing money into savings accounts and contracting out work to traveling psychologists or non-district special education support staff.\n\nThe last time San Francisco educators went on strike was in 1979, according to the union. The strike lasted for seven weeks.\n\nThe union didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday via email.\n\nIn a post on Sunday, the San Francisco Unified School District's Superintendent Maria Su said they \"remain committed to negotiating in good faith with UESF and working toward an agreement that supports our students, educators, and school communities.\"\n\nA special Board of Education meeting is scheduled for Wednesday that will focus on labor negotiations, which includes a resolution that would allow the superintendent to make \"necessary operational decisions in the event of a strike,\" the post said.\n\nThe strike authorization vote came on the same day as educators in Southern California also signaled they were gearing up to head to the picket lines to demand better pay and working conditions.\n\nUnited Teachers Los Angeles members also gave their leadership authorization to call a strike.

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "Emily Beutner, the daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner, died on Jan. 6\n\nThe 22-year-old college student died at the hospital after she was found seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” by a highway in Palmdale, Calif.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said\n\nThe 22-year-old daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner has died after seemingly experiencing a medical emergency. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.\n\nEmily Beutner died on Jan. 6 after she was spotted seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” on the side of the highway in Palmdale, Calif., shortly after 12 a.m. local time, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) said in a press release obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nA witness in the area — the intersection of Sierra Highway and Technology Drive — had alerted authorities to a woman in a “state of medical distress,” Lt. Michael Modica told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe politician’s daughter was treated at the scene and transported to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, according to the LASD.\n\nLASD homicide investigators “responded and assumed control of the death investigation,” the sheriff’s department said. Speaking with the Times, however, Modica warned that this should not be taken as an indication of Emily’s cause of death, as this is typical for a young person found dead in a situation like this one.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, the cause of death has not yet been determined, with Emily’s case remaining open, according to Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office records viewed by PEOPLE.\n\nAustin shared a statement with the Times in the wake of his daughter’s death.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said. “We ask for privacy and your prayers at this time.”\n\nEmily is one of four adult children Austin shares with his wife, Virginia, according to his campaign website. She was a junior at Loyola Marymount University (LMU), where she was studying studio arts, according to a statement shared by the university in the wake of her death.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“Please join me in extending our deepest condolences to Emily’s family and loved ones, and in holding Emily and all who are grieving her loss in our collective thoughts and prayers,” said LMU President Thomas Poon.\n\nPoon also said that the L.A.-based private university will honor Emily with a plaque at its student memorial.\n\nAustin’s opponent in the mayoral race, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, also issued a statement following Emily’s death.\n\n“I am profoundly saddened by the news of the tragic passing of Austin Beutner’s daughter,” Bass said. “There is no way to describe the depth of pain experienced by parents who have lost a child. My heart is broken for the Beutner family, and I offer Austin, his wife Virginia, and their entire family my deepest condolences.\"\n\n\"I will hold them close in my heart,” the mayor’s statement continued, “and I am ready to assist the family with whatever they might need.”",
