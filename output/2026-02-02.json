    "fullText": "We now know how Knicks feel about trading for Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks are among the franchises that have been linked to Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo on the trade market.\n\nIf the Knicks were to trade for the two-time MVP before the upcoming Feb. 5 trade deadline, there would be no excuse for New York to fall short of an NBA Finals appearance for the second consecutive season.\n\nAccording to a recent report from ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, it’s clear how New York feels about trading for Antetokounmpo this season.\n\n“The Knicks believe in this team,\" Windhorst said Monday. “They believed in this team last summer when Giannis was loosely available in those discussions. They didn't make an aggressive offer at the time to progress those talks.”\n\n“If they want to win a bidding war now, I think it's going to take a three or four-team trade where they take some of their players and get other assets for them, and then come back to the Bucks and make very strong offers. That is just not happening. They are not showing that aggression to get Giannis right now, and I think that's because they like this team.\"\n\nThe Knicks’ stance on potentially acquiring Antetokounmpo from Milwaukee wouldn’t have made sense a few weeks ago. After starting the year with a 23-9 record, the franchise lost nine of its next 11 games and appeared to be headed toward a complete meltdown.\n\nHowever, the Jalen Brunson-led Knicks have turned things around since then, winning six straight games, with five of them being double-digit victories.\n\nAlthough Antetokounmpo has the championship experience New York is missing, it’s understandable that the Knicks would want to roll with their current group and attempt to bring a title to New York in June.\n\nMore NBA: Lakers linked to trade for 'sleeper' $37.7 million Warriors guard",

    "title": "Raheem Morris primer: What to expect from the 49ers defense and how each position is impacted",
    "description": "Breaking down what to expect from the 49ers defense under their new DC, and who will benefit the most",
    "fullText": "When the San Francisco 49ers interviewed only three candidates for the defensive coordinator job, it felt like the two minority candidates were nothing more than a formality before hiring Gus Bradley. We will see if Bradley heads elsewhere after the 49ers hired Raheem Morris to replace Robert Saleh as their defensive coordinator.\n\nThere was speculation that Jim Schwartz would be a candidate. Recent reports have made Eagles’ defensive coordinator Vic Fangio’s return uncertain. Ultimately, Shanahan gets to work with Morris for the fourth time in the NFL.\n\nMorris’s Rams’ defense aligns with the 49ers’ defensive philosophy heading into last offseason: stop the run. From 2021 through 2023, while Morris was the Rams’ defensive coordinator, they ranked seventh in rushing EPA and fifth in rushing success rate.\n\nAt his core, Morris runs an odd front. So you’re going to hear a lot about how Nick Bosa will have to stand up, maybe five plays a season. You can run 5-man fronts with your base defensive end having his hand in the ground—more on that shortly. It’s worth noting that Morris has shown flexibility. Back in 2020, his defense ran only an odd or bear front — a 3-4 look —17 percent of the time.\n\nHere is an example of a couple of odd fronts Morris and Jeff Ulbrich ran last year with Atlanta:\n\nThat is a classic “bear front,” where you have a pair of 3-techniques and a nose tackle head up over the center. From a personnel perspective, it is easy to see how the 49ers could get their three rookies from the 2025 draft on the field at the same time. CJ West would be the nose tackle, while Alfred Collins and Mykel Williams would be the 3-techniques. Then Nick Bosa and whichever edge rusher the down-and-distance calls for on the opposite side. Morris isn’t going to be the coach to tell Bosa he has to stand up in this scenario.\n\nWhen you do run these five-man fronts, and let’s say Bosa is lined up to the side where there are multiple tight ends or eligible receivers, like the screenshot below, that’s when Bosa would more than likely need to peel off into the flat or drop as a hook defender, which is what ended up happening with the Falcons:\n\nOne way to ensure Bosa rushes the passer is by walking down a linebacker to the edge. In today’s NFL, this is known as a “Penny” front, and it’s something Morris has been doing for years. In Atlanta, he used Kaden Elliss as their adjuster in base packages. Morris did the same with Ernest Jones when he was in Los Angeles. These players can moonlight as edge rushers.\n\nThe adjuster for the 49ers was Dee Winters in 2025, who lined up on the edge 78 times last season. Here’s an example of Winters walking down to the edge in Week 1 on the left side of the screen. Next to him is Mykel Williams, with Jordan Elliott at nose, Kalia Davis as the other defensive tackle, and Bosa on the opposite edge.\n\nThis front all but ensures Winters, Mykel, and Bosa all get 1-on-1 opportunities. Hiring Morris could end up being one of the most beneficial things to happen for the 49ers’ first-round pick from 2025. The majority of Williams’ rushes should come from the interior under Morris with a runway. You can’t ask for a better setup.\n\nI was wondering who would be the 3-technique and how much the 49ers would need to invest in a defensive tackle this offseason, but that player is already on the roster. It’s just a matter of how quickly Williams will develop in Year 2.\n\nWinters is under contract for one more season. We don’t know what to expect from Nick Martin because we didn’t see much of him as a rookie. However, Martin’s calling card coming out of college was that he was at his best rushing the passer. Walking Martin down in these fronts, given his history, likely made Morris an easy sell.\n\nThe 49ers’ signing Elliss as a linebacker would be the least surprising move, given his fit in this defense and how it would allow Warner to patrol the middle, if Morris isn’t a fan of Winters or Martin.\n\nHere’s another look at Winters walking down as the adjuster the following week in New Orleans when the 49ers were in their base defense:\n\nWinters is on the left side of the screen, lined up next to Mykel. The 49ers are in their “big nickel” personnel, with Ji’Ayir Brown in instead of Upton Stout. Not that he can’t do it, but these strong reductions protect Stout from being in the run fit down after down. Instead, as you can see, the nickel is protected, and now it’s a linebacker inserted into the action.\n\nBosa’s return to health should unlock Bryce Huff. Williams cemented himself as an interior pass rusher, and those two outside of him will lead to favorable matchups. If the defense can get anything out of Collins and West as pass rushers, the product on the field in 2025 will seem like a distant memory.\n\nPlayers like Sam Okuayinonu, a restricted free agent, and Keion White should have a greater impact with reduced roles as sub-package players. To reach its ceiling, the team will need the top two picks from the ’25 draft to contribute.\n\nHaving a dominant linebacker like Fred Warner gives Morris the versatility he hasn’t had. The beauty of these 5-1 penny fronts is that you really only need one linebacker. When that player is Warner, you can be uber-aggressive elsewhere.\n\nAfter six weeks of the 2025 season, the Falcons’ defense ranked No. 1 in total DVOA, including first against the run and the pass. They were No. 5 in EPA per play. They were blitzing at a rate that would make Kyle Shanahan triple-check the numbers. Atlanta’s blitz rate was 42.4 percent, second only to Brian Flores.\n\nIt was a sign that Morris was comfortable evolving his scheme. After all, we’re talking about a guy who comes from a Vic Fangio-adjacent tree, and they are not known for their blitzing. The Falcons weren’t getting after the quarterback, so they decided to turn up the heat and manufacture pressure by blitzing.\n\nThe Falcons loved to blitz their nickel. Only two cornerbacks in the league blitzed more than Stout did last year. Stout’s win percentage as a pass rusher was 20.5 percent. It’s a skill set that is just scratching the surface. No player won more at his position with at least 15 pass rushes last year than Stout. He bested second place by three percentage points. It’s another building block for Morris to use in passing situations.\n\nThe Falcons ran Cover 3 at the fifth-highest rate last season and Cover 6 at the third-highest rate. That’s where the 49ers will likely live this year, with quarters being sprinkled into the mix. Despite the heavy blitz usage, Atlanta ran man coverage (Cover 1) at the third-lowest rate last season.\n\nWhich brings us to the secondary…\n\nJessie Bates found out about Morris’s versatility at safety this past season after being named a second-team All-Pro. Bates, who had primarily been a free safety, had lined up closer to the line of scrimmage and in the box more than any other season in his career through the midway point of 2025.\n\nLast year, in every regular-season game, 49ers’ cornerbacks Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green lined up on the same side. Falcons cornerback A.J. Terrell often shadowed a receiver. If there was an obvious No. 1 on the other side, Terrell was following him. That will be a change from Saleh to Morris, especially if the 49ers feel like they have a cornerback who is quality enough to travel with the opposition’s best.\n\nSaleh didn’t do that until it was time to throw the kitchen sink at his opponents and give them looks they weren’t prepared for. To me, that suggests he didn’t believe he had the coverage players to travel.\n\nYou wonder how much the Rams’ secondary play influenced Morris’s decisions in Atlanta. Xavier Watts was the last pick in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft, but he came into the league known as a ballhawk, and did nothing to change those preconceived notions after having five interceptions and six pass breakups as a rookie. Bates had three interceptions in 2026, but had 10 in the previous two seasons combined.\n\nMorris has zero ties to any of the players on the 49ers defense. We know he’s not going to pivot off Bosa, Warner, Williams, and Stout, but it wouldn’t be a surprise to see a change at any other position.\n\nThe coverage silos the Falcons ran last year align with the strengths of Deommodore Lenoir and Renardo Green. Neither will be exposed in man coverage against the high-level wideouts. That doesn’t mean there will be a full game when they aren’t in 1-on-1 scenarios, but Saleh to Morris should make for a simple transition on the perimeter.\n\nThis is not breaking news, but the 49ers don’t have a Bates-level safety on their roster. Malik Mustapha and Ji’Ayir Brown specialize in coming downhill and making plays near the line of scrimmage. Brown is under contract for one more season. Marques Sigle did not show he could play the ball in the air as a rookie. All of these signs point to the 49ers finding a free safety this offseason.\n\nThere are plenty of options in the draft. Judging by everything Morris asks of his safeties and where the current depth chart stands, don’t be surprised to see the Niners use their highest pick on a safety under the John Lynch-Shanahan regime. That’s the one glaring hole on this side of the ball in Morris’s scheme, especially if there will be a spike in blitz rate.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have confirmed that Ethan Wheatley has completed a move to Bradford City, where he will play until the end of the season.\n\nWheatley spent the first half of the campaign on loan at Northampton Town, having signed for them during the summer transfer window.\n\nHe endured a slow start to life at the club but his form improved and he eventually established himself as a key member of the squad under Kevin Nolan. Wheatley made 22 League One appearances for Northampton, contributing three goals and as many assists.\n\nAs with all loanees, United inserted a January break clause in the deal to send Wheatley to Northampton. The Red Devils exercised this option, much to the dismay of Nolan.\n\nIt then emerged that United felt a loan spell elsewhere would most benefit Wheatley’s development, with Bradford positioning themselves to secure him for the rest of the campaign.\n\nNow, United have announced that a deal has been completed.\n\nReacting to the switch, Wheatley told Bradford’s in-house media, “I am buzzing. We have been in talks for quite a while.”\n\n“Now we have got the deal done, I am really excited to come in and help the team. I am over the moon to have got it signed and I cannot wait to get going.”\n\nHe continued, “I have had a few appearances at United, where I played in front of 70,000 supporters; it was a great experience for me.”\n\n“I am happy with what I did at Northampton in the first part of this season. I thought I did a good job.”\n\n“I had League Two experience last season, then League One this campaign, and I thought I grew a lot as a player, especially in the last couple of months when I was able to play more of my game. am now hoping to show more of that here at Bradford.”\n\nBradford’s next assignment is away at Luton Town on Saturday. The contest is an early kick-off.\n\nFeatured image Pete Norton via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "GREEN BAY – As Matt LaFleur gears up for his eight season as coach of the Green Bay Packers, he has officially hired ex-Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon as defensive coordinator, the Packers announced in a Feb. 2 press release.\n\nGannon, who spent three seasons as coach in Arizona, replaces newly hired Miami Dolphins coach Jeff Hafley.\n\nGannon, 43, was 15-36 with the Cardinals. One of his losses came last October when the Packers beat the Cardinals 27-23 in Arizona.\n\nDuring Gannon’s tenure, Arizona ranked No. 2 in the NFL in yards per carry (4.92) and No. 9 in rushing offense (125.5 yards per game).\n\n\"We are thrilled to add Jonathan Gannon to our coaching staff. He possesses tremendous experience as an NFL coordinator and head coach,\" LaFleur said in a statement. \"I am confident that he will be an outstanding addition to our organization, as well as a strong leader of our defense.\"\n\nBefore coaching in Arizona, Gannon was the Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator for two seasons, with his last season being the 2022 Super Bowl run.\n\nIn Gannon's first season in Philadelphia in 2021, the Eagles' defense surrendered 5.2 yards per play, tied for the seventh-fewest in the league, and were tied for fifth-fewest takeaways in the NFL with 16.\n\nIn 2022, Philadelphia was No. 2 in overall defense, led the NFL with a team-record 70 sacks and was tied for No. 4 in the league in takeaways (27) and interceptions (17). The Eagles became the first team in league history to have four players register 10-plus sacks in a single season, and their 70 sacks were the most by a team since the 1989 Minnesota Vikings (71).\n\nPACKERS DC: What to know about new Packers defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon\n\nGannon rose through the coaching ranks working with defenses, including as a defensive backs coach. Over 18 years, Gannon has made coaching stops with the Atlanta Falcons (2007), Tennessee Titans (2012-13), Minnesota Vikings (2014-17) and Indianapolis Colts (2018-20) before arriving in Philadelphia.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers News: Packers coach Matt LaFleur 'thrilled' to hire Jonathan Gannon as DC",

Luckily, it seems a recurring trade partner could be up for one more trade.\n\nAccording to Fansided’s Zachary Rotman, the Sox should link up with their old GM Chaim Bloom, and the St. Louis Cardinals for one last trade, this time for All-Star Brendan Donovan.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Cubs trade sees Chicago deal Matt Shaw-based package for $300 million two-time Cy Young\n\nThe trade would look like this:\n\nRed Sox get: UTIL Brendan Donovan\n\nCardinals get: LHP Payton Tolle (MLB No. 28 Prospect), LHP Kyle Harrison, RHP Juan Valera\n\n“The Red Sox have arguably the most starting pitching depth in the league, even without Tolle and Harrison, and even without Tolle, Connelly Early is a high end, MLB-ready left-handed pitching prospect for them to be excited about. No, this absurd depth doesn't mean the Red Sox should just give Tolle away, but Donovan would be a major upgrade and fit what the team is reportedly looking for…Adding another left-handed hitter might be less-than-ideal, but Donovan checks every other box. After whiffing on impactful position player free agents like Pete Alonso, Alex Bregman and Bo Bichette, it's on Craig Breslow to be aggressive in the trade market. Parting with three starters they really don't need all that much to fill a glaring hole feels like an obvious move to make,” Rotman wrote.\n\nMORE: Proposed blockbuster Phillies trade sees Philadelphia deal for $300 million two-time Cy Young to replace Ranger Suarez\n\nThis past season, Donovan slashed .287/.353/.422/.775 with 32 doubles, 10 home runs, and 64 RBI in 118 games played.

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams signed Davante Adams to a two-year contract last offseason and they appear to have no plans of terminating it early. Sean McVay told reporters on Monday that the Rams “absolutely” expect Adams to remain in Los Angeles next season, which will be the final year of his contract.\n\nMcVay said he has “no reason to believe” Adams won’t be back in 2026, a strong indication that the veteran receiver will give it another go next season in pursuit of his first Super Bowl appearance.\n\nAdams led the NFL with 14 touchdown receptions this season, the third time he’s finished tops in the league in that category – all with different teams, too.\n\nSean McVay said he has \"no reason to believe\" Davante Adams won't be back with the Rams next season\n\n— Adam Grosbard (@AdamGrosbard) February 2, 2026\n\nWhen asked if Davante Adams will be back next season, Sean McVay said, “Oh yeah, absolutely.” He added that he has no reason to believe otherwise.\n\n— Wyatt Miller (@wymill07) February 2, 2026\n\nAdams' contract was for two years and $44 million, including $26 million fully guaranteed, per Over The Cap. His salary in 2026 is $18 million, with a total cap hit of $28 million.\n\nIf the Rams were to move on from Adams, for whatever reason, it would save them $14 million in cap space, while simultaneously putting $14 million in dead money on the books for next season. His contract makes it difficult for the Rams to cut him, though they seem to have no interest in doing so anyway.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams' Sean McVay 'absolutely' expects Davante Adams back next season",

    "fullText": "Malik Tillman delivered the defining American performance of the week, turning a Champions League start into a statement showing for Bayer Leverkusen. Starting just behind Patrik Schick against Villarreal, Tillman played a central role from the opening minutes, pressing aggressively and consistently finding space between the lines. His work paid off early. In the 12th minute, Tillman forced a mistake under pressure, blocking a rushed clearance from goalkeeper Arnau Tenas that ricocheted into the net for Leverkusen’s opener. It was a scrappy goal, but it reflected his activity and intensity high up the pitch.\n\nMalik Tillman bags a first half brace to boost Bayern Leverkusen's place in the play-off spots 🥶🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/GeIfjQLnUm\n\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) January 28, 2026\n\nTillman’s second was far more emphatic. Ten minutes before halftime, Alejandro Grimaldo’s cross was headed down by Schick, and Tillman met it with a controlled half-volley into the bottom-right corner. The finish capped a dominant first-half display in which Tillman repeatedly found dangerous positions, nearly adding another with a driven effort deflected wide earlier in the match. Leverkusen cruised to a 3-0 win, comfortably securing their place in the Champions League play-offs, with Tillman scoring both of their first-half goals.\n\nHe followed that performance with another goal on the weekend against Eintracht Frankfurt. Tillman started again and struck in the 33rd minute, finishing from the center of the box after a pass from Christian Kofane. Beyond the goal, he remained involved on both sides of the ball, winning free kicks in attack and defense and supplying a late first-half cross that nearly produced another goal. Tillman was substituted late as Leverkusen closed out a 3-1 win, rounding out a week that featured three goals across two competitions and steady involvement throughout.\n\nWhile Tillman set the tone, Weston McKennie and Folarin Balogun shared the stage midweek in Monaco as Juventus and Monaco played to a scoreless draw in the Champions League. McKennie started on the right side of a Juventus front three and was involved early, taking a shot inside the opening minutes and later delivering a cross that just missed its target. Juventus struggled to generate clean looks, but McKennie remained active, keeping plays alive along the wing and competing consistently in duels.\n\nBalogun led the line for Monaco and was their primary outlet in transition. He had a goal ruled out for a foul in the buildup and later tested Mattia Perin with a curling effort that was comfortably saved. Monaco’s best moments often came when play went long toward Balogun, though support was limited in the final third. The draw suited both sides, as each advanced to the play-off round.\n\nMcKennie followed that up with a strong league performance against Parma. Playing as an attacking midfielder, he scored Juventus’ second goal just before halftime, adjusting his run to meet a cross from Pierre Kalulu and volleying into the bottom-right corner. The goal came after a tense first half in which McKennie was booked and briefly reviewed for a potential red card before escaping further punishment. He continued to contribute in transition before being substituted in the second half, as Juventus pulled away for a 4-1 road win.\n\nWESTON MCKENNIE SCORES ON THE VOLLEY 🇺🇸\n\nThat's four goals already in 2026. In the form of his life 🔥pic.twitter.com/rRKRMEzqva\n\n— Men in Blazers (@MenInBlazers) February 1, 2026\n\nBalogun returned to league action on Saturday against Rennes and made an immediate impact. He assisted Monaco’s opening goal on a fast break, setting up Ansu Fati to give the hosts the lead. Balogun remained involved until the 56th minute, when he was forced off with a hamstring injury. Monaco went on to win 4-0, but Balogun’s injury now looms as a concern after he exited early despite a productive start.\n\nIn Scotland, Auston Trusty continued to build momentum with Celtic in European play. Starting at center back against Utrecht in the Europa League, Trusty scored a crucial second-half goal, glancing a header into the top-right corner from a corner kick to restore Celtic’s two-goal cushion. He had earlier been involved in a VAR review after his header struck an opponent’s arm, leading to a penalty. The goal marked his second in the Europa League and helped Celtic secure a 4-2 win and a place in the knockout phase play-offs.\n\nAuston Trusty restores Celtic's two goal lead as the USMNT international scores in back to back Europa League games 💪 pic.twitter.com/dabKlFo8bD\n\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) January 29, 2026\n\nPatrick Agyemang rounded out the week with another goal for Derby County. Starting against Bristol City, Agyemang remained active throughout, taking multiple shots and drawing fouls before finally breaking through in the 66th minute. He scored Derby’s fourth goal with a header from close range, finishing off a cross from Joe Ward. Agyemang was substituted shortly after, capping a productive outing in a dominant 5-0 win.",

    "fullText": "Oh boy. If fans wanted the Michigan vs. Michigan State rivalry on the basketball court to get back to where it was during the John Beilein era, then they've got it now. After Friday night's game between Michigan and Michigan State, a game that was ultimately won by the Wolverines, there was quite a bit of back-and-forth on social media about some perceived missed calls, on both sides.\n\nThat debate reached a fever pitch on Monday morning, when Michigan head coach Dusty May was asked about a play where Michigan fans feel Jeremy Fears Jr. appeared to trip U of M star Yaxel Lendeborg. \"Appeared?\" May replied to the question. May would go on to accuse Michigan State of making 'several plays that are very dangerous' throughout the game.\n\nFollowing Michigan State's practice on Monday, Tom Izzo was asked about May's comments, and he was very fired up in his response back, as reported by Chris Solari of the Detroit Free Press:\n\n\"I thought there were a couple of plays the other way, too... Michigan's over, I'm moving on to Minnesota...I don't care what Dusty says.\"\n\n\"If anyone did anything dirty, tell him to call me.\"\n\n\"I think there were some question mark calls. I think there were some question mark things that went both ways. Remember this: Whether I hug & kiss Dusty or he hugs and kisses me, we got beat by a better team.\"\n\nIzzo also noted that he felt like Jeremy Fears and Michigan guard Elliot Cadeau were going at each other equally throughout the game.\n\nThat's one way to reignite a rivalry.\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan state news, notes, and opinion.

According to the New York Post’s Mike Puma, Diaz came out of the celebration unable to put weight on his right knee, and was put in a wheelchair.\n\nSoonafter, it was revealed that he had suffered a full-thickness tear of the patellar tendon in his right knee, requiring him to miss the entirety of the 2023 MLB season.\n\nAfter a down season in 2024, returning from a year-long absence because of knee surgery, Díaz produced one of his best seasons ever in 2025.

    "fullText": "The House Committee on Education and Workforce has asked the University of Utah to schedule a briefing to discuss the school’s plans to take money from a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nThe committee, which has jurisdiction over federal education policy, is examining the growing trend of schools seeking institutional partners to capitalize their athletic departments. The group is assessing whether legislative action might be needed to address concerns about the downstream impact of these deals.\n\nColorado's Dempsey Goes From House Objector to China Scholar\n\nSports Tech Mergers Double in Value in 'Landmark Year'\n\nCollege Recruiting Costs Shrink as Football Powers Adapt to Portal\n\nIn a letter sent to Utah president Taylor Randall on Monday morning, a copy of which was viewed by Sportico, the committee requested that the school share information regarding the details and motives behind its potential partnership with Otro Capital, which its trustees greenlit in December.\n\n“While recognizing the escalating costs in collegiate athletics, including revenue share obligations under the House v. NCAA settlement, NIL-related expenses and coaching salaries, the committee seeks to better understand the university’s rationale for entering into this arrangement,” committee chair Tim Walberg (R—Mich.) and Burgess Owens (R—Utah), a former NFL and University of Miami player and chairman of the subcommittee on Higher Education Workforce Development, wrote in the letter. “The information and briefing requested will assist the committee in determining whether legislative action may be necessary to protect students, schools and the integrity of college athletics.”\n\nAs conversations between schools and institutional funds have grown more public, so too have concerns from lawmakers. Last month, on the verge of the College Football Playoff title game, Reps. Michael Baumgartner (R—Wash.) and Haley Stevens (D—Mich.) wrote a letter to NCAA president Charlie Baker asking him to limit the emergence of PE deals that “threaten the integrity of university governance and the quality of college sports in ways that will have disastrous consequences for athletes, students and fans.”\n\nLocal state-level lawmakers in both Utah and Washington have proposed bills that would also make it harder to execute these deals.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce’s letter to Randall requests that the university share terms of the arrangement and answer three specific questions:\n\nWhat factors and considerations led the university to pursue this partnership, and why was this approach selected over other potential financing options?\n\nWhat steps is the university taking to maintain institutional control and to protect student-athlete welfare, including compliance with Title IX under this partnership structure?\n\nHow might this partnership affect student costs, particularly with respect to mandatory student fees that subsidize the athletic department, and are any changes to the fee structure anticipated following implementation?\n\nRepresentatives for Utah and its athletic department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe University of Utah trustees voted during their December meeting to allow Randall, athletic department Mark Harlan and others to finalize a deal with Otro. While it’s unclear if that final arrangement has been signed, the structure of the deal was openly discussed. Utah is spinning the Utes’ athletics revenue streams into a for-profit entity, and plans to sell an equity stake in that business.\n\nRandall played a prominent part in the formal 110-minute pitch to the trustees, helping explain the macro reasons why Utah is seeking the money, and why Otro Capital was the right partner.\n\nFinancial specifics, however, have been sparse. The school has declined to share details on a deal that likely tops nine figures. A Sportico open records request for any term sheet between the school and Otro, filed back in September, is yet to be fulfilled following multiple university extensions.\n\nUtah is not alone in seeking institutional money to adapt to the modern economics of college sports. The Big Ten, for example, was recently on the verge of a $2.4 billion partnership with a California pension fund, but those talks are now on hold after pushback from some conference members about the 20-year revenue share commitment that came with the deal.\n\nThe Big 12 is in advanced talks on a potential $500 million deal with Collegiate Athletic Solutions (CAS), a fund backed by RedBird Capital and Weatherford Capital, that would let schools take upfront money in exchange for revenue sharing on the back end. That deal, unlike the proposals involving Utah and the Big Ten, does not involve any equity changing hands.\n\nSeparately, a number of other schools, such as Kentucky and Clemson, have created similar separate commercial entities, but they are yet to take outside institutional investment. Those deals are widely considered necessary step for public schools to take on institutional money for athletics.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and Workforce, which dates back to 1867, has 21 majority members, and 16 minority members. Under House Rule X, the committee is tasked with reviewing and coordinating “laws, programs and government activities relating to domestic educational programs and institutions and programs of student assistance within the jurisdiction of other committees.”\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2025?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings\n\nEverything to Know About the 2025 Emirates NBA Cup",

    "description": "After two huge wins at Michigan State last weekend, both Michigan Men’s and Women’s Basketball are in the top-10 of the AP Poll for the 11th straight week:",
    "fullText": "For the 11th consecutive week, both the men’s and women’s basketball teams at the University of Michigan are ranked in the top-10 of the AP Poll after each squad beat Michigan State at the Breslin Center this past week. The men’s team is now back up to No. 2, while the women’s team rose one spot to No. 8.\n\nThis is the fifth time that Dusty May’s squad has been ranked No. 2, and the first time since the Week 10 poll on Jan. 5. The men’s team had as good of a week as you can have in college basketball, handing No. 5 Nebraska its first loss of the season before traveling to East Lansing and beating Tom Izzo’s No. 7 Spartans. Two top-10 wins against teams that each have a real chance of winning the Big Ten title, with the second win coming on just two day’s rest, is impressive.\n\nMichigan also earned it’s No. 1 spot in KenPom back, and is also ranked No. 3 in the NET with an 8-0 record in Quad 1 games. Other analytics sites — EvanMiya.com and Bart Torvik — also have Michigan rated as the No. 1 team in the country. Looking at all the projections across the country on Bracket Matrix, Michigan is expected to be a 1-seed come tournament time.\n\nCompared to this past week, on paper, this week should be much easier for the Wolverines. Upsets are always possible, but Michigan plays two Big Ten teams in the next seven days, both of which it has already beaten by double digits. Michigan hosts Penn State (Thursday, Feb. 5, 6:30 p.m. on FS1) before heading to Columbus to take on the Buckeyes (Sunday, Feb. 8, 1 p.m. on CBS) in a game Ohio State pretty much has to win in order to make the tournament.\n\nThe women’s team also picked up two wins last week, beating Indiana in Bloomington before beating the Spartans in overtime in East Lansing. That MSU game was especially exciting, with sophomore point guard Mila Holloway scoring a career-high 26 points and the Wolverines playing excellent defense down the stretch. That win against MSU — which was ranked No. 13 at the time and is now ranked No. 12 — is Michigan’s third ranked win of the season and eighth Big Ten win in a row.\n\nRanked sixth in the NET, barring a large losing streak, the Wolverines are in a good spot to be a top-four seed in the NCAA Tournament, meaning we’d get a Round of 64 game and potentially a Round of 32 game in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe ladies return home for two games this week, as Michigan takes on Nebraska on Wednesday, Feb. 4 (7 p.m. on B1G+), a potential trap game before No. 2 UCLA comes to town on Super Bowl Sunday (Feb. 8, 3 p.m. on FOX). A win against UCLA would almost certainly vault Michigan into a top-five ranking for the first time this season.",

He compiled an overall record of 33-29 during his time at Orange Lutheran.\n\nSherman’s wife, Kristen, is also the school’s girls flag football head coach.\n\nThis past season was an up-and-down campaign for Orange Lutheran as the Lancers went from 4-4 to 2-6, having to forfeit their first two wins of the season against Miami Northwestern, a 17-13 victory on the field, and a 27-24 decision over Rancho Cucamonga due to use of an ineligible player.\n\nA student-athlete had transferred to Orange Lutheran before the 2025-26 school year, which the unnamed player was cleared to play with his residency was deemed valid.

    "fullText": "Southampton have drawn a firm line under West Ham United’s interest in Taylor Harwood Bellis, with the defender set to remain on the south coast after two offers for a permanent transfer were rejected, according to The Athletic.\n\nThe 24 year old has started each of Southampton’s past 18 league matches, a run that explains why the club consider him “too important to let depart”. Since arriving in 2023, initially on loan before a £20m permanent move following promotion, Harwood Bellis has become a constant presence at the heart of the side.\n\nSouthampton’s stance reflects trust in continuity. The defender’s journey through multiple loans before settling has sharpened his game, and the club see him as a cornerstone rather than currency. His background includes spells at Burnley, Blackburn Rovers, Stoke City and Anderlecht, plus eight first team appearances under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City.\n\nFor West Ham United, the message is clear. Southampton are prioritising consolidation over cashing in.\n\nHarwood Bellis looked like a sensible target, proven at Premier League level, still developing, and exactly the profile West Ham need to strengthen their defensive core. Two rejected bids underline that the club were serious, even if the timing was always awkward.\n\nThere is frustration that Southampton can now turn down offers that once might have been accepted. That speaks to shifting power dynamics and the premium placed on reliable defenders. Fans will wonder whether West Ham could have moved earlier, before Harwood Bellis became so central to Southampton’s plans.\n\nAt the same time, supporters will recognise the logic. Overpaying in January can damage longer term planning, and West Ham have been burned by that before. The hope is that this pursuit was part of a wider shortlist, not a singular gamble.\n\nUltimately, this outcome should sharpen recruitment rather than derail it. West Ham fans want ambition matched by discipline. Missing out on Harwood Bellis is disappointing, but the real test is whether the club pivot quickly to a defender who can make a similar impact without compromising the bigger picture.",

    "fullText": "We can’t (or won’t) tell if these signings will be good or not, but we certainly can say what kind of vibes they bring to the table.\n\nThe winter transfer window has officially come and gone. And while the Euro football normies somewhat snooze over the midseason shuffle, it’s the most wonderful time of the year for MLS roster wonks. Us sickos scour the internet and theorize about which big names and undiscovered gems might arrive to North America in search of footballing glory, a big old paycheck, or some combination of both.\n\nSince the league’s inception in 1996, the January window, a mere footnote in the more prestigious European leagues, has been the busy shopping season for MLS as contenders seek to bolster their Supporters’ Shield and playoff credentials, while bottom-feeders occasionally swing big and hustle to claw themselves out of the doldrums.\n\nWhile the splashiest moves come from Europe and South America, the median MLS transfer is of the intra-league variety. There’s something to be said for signing players who are familiar with the competition, who understand the level of physicality on the pitch and the tribulations of frequent long-distance travel off it. But there’s no certainty that any given signing will actually work, even when it might seem like a slam dunk. Any attempt to evaluate MLS transfers in advance will invariably leave the evaluator with egg on their face and a laundry list of buffoonish receipts that can later be aggregated and packaged as USDA certified, Grade A freezing-cold takes.\n\nThat’s why I’ll be taking a different approach to “grading” a few high-profile January transfers and free agency signings. Below, we’ll take a look at some of the biggest moves from the early bit of 2026, and explain a bit about how they make us feel. Real vibes stuff, you know?\n\nGrade: Your favorite band releases a genre-defying album and you don’t hate it.\n\nToronto FC has finally moved on from the ill-fated Italian Era and is seeking to reassert itself on the Eastern Conference table. Despite finishing in 12th last season, putting up a measly 32 points in 34 matches, Toronto’s defense wasn’t the issue, allowing the third-fewest goals in the Eastern conference.\n\nBut yet another season in the bottom half of the standings led the club to opt for a change, declining to pick up the contracts of veteran depth defenders Kevin Long, Raoul Petratta, and Sigurd Rosted.\n\nWalker Zimmerman arrives as a ready-made partner to the young, talented Zane Monlouis, an Arsenal academy graduate who signed for the Ontarians in February of last year. He suffered a season-ending hip injury in June, but his rehabilitation went better than planned and he figures to be back fighting for his spot in preseason.\n\nNashville could have figured out a way to re-sign Zimmerman, a player who served as their captain, scored the first goal in club history, and was part of the squad that lifted the U.S. Open Cup in 2025, the first major trophy for the club. He was a high-profile member of the relatively-successful U.S. men’s national team at the 2022 World Cup, and he served as one of the major faces of the franchise as it gained massive traction and support from the sporting community of the Music City. Injuries certainly hampered his latter days with Nashville (he was brutally bicycle-kicked by Kerwin Vargas and subsequently hospitalized back in April), and the club ultimately decided to let the blond behemoth test the waters of free agency.\n\nAfter a career-defining spell in Nashville, Zimmerman insists that he joined up with Toronto to win trophies. He’ll fit well into Robin Fraser’s system of building from the back, and he’s got an ambitious long ball or two in his locker that just might work against opponents who play high lines. He’s tall, physically imposing, and when he makes a career move he tends to stick around for a while.\n\nWhile the USMNT seems to have moved on, there still exists the remote possibility that Zimmerman could earn a call up to the 2026 World Cup squad as a depth option. He’ll be arriving to Toronto with a chip on his shoulder, and if he can turn around a club that has recently seen some huge swing and misses in the transfer market, he just might make himself into a legend for an unthinkable fourth MLS club.\n\nGrade: Your ex-boyfriend, who got in a fight with your dad, shows up with a boombox outside of your house and promises you he can change.\n\nIt’s fair to say that Hector Herrera’s first stint with the Houston Dynamo didn’t go exactly as planned. He started poorly for the club, and it seemed that his age and recurring hamstring issues would prevent him from being the midfield force that he was for Porto and Atletico Madrid. But eventually he settled into the league and led the Dynamo to the 2023 U.S. Open Cup and a surprise Western Conference Finals berth in 2023 when they were undone by an inevitable LAFC side. He was an integral part of manager Ben Olsen’s revamping of the club’s culture and performance on the pitch.\n\n2024 was not so kind, and while they finished a respectable fifth in the Western Conference, the Dynamo were dumped out of the first round of the playoffs by the Seattle Sounders. Late in the final game of the series, Herrera was sent off for spitting in the direction of referee Armando Villareal. He subsequently earned a three-game ban from the league, which as of this writing he has not yet served. During his time in Europe, Herrera gained something of a reputation as a dirty player, and he hasn’t done much to undo that in recent years.\n\nHerrera spent 2025 with Toluca in Mexico, but claims in interviews that he never actually wanted to leave Houston. He struggled all last year to claim a starting spot in Toluca, and a falling out with the Mexican federation has seen him languish without a national team call up since he originally joined MLS in 2022. His campaign of bridge-burning has been nothing short of impressive, as he rankled the Mexican soccer community by claiming that he deserves to be considered a top-five greatest ever Mexican player at the expense of legends such as Cuahtemoc Blanco and Jorge Campos.\n\nThe Dynamo regressed in 2025, and one gets the impression that patience with Olsen might be running thin as he struggles to squeeze the juice from a talented roster. Will Herrera make the Dynamo’s midfield better? Almost certainly not. The midfield group down in H-Town is already old, with Junior Urso on the wrong side of 35 and new signing Agustin Bouzat from Velez Sarsfield is 31. Artur remains the heartbeat for Houston in the center of the pitch, but even he will turn 30 in March.\n\nMaybe Herrera will come in, turn back the years, and be the player he once was for the Dynamo. If it’s up to me to guess, however, I’d say that the inertia of late-career ineffectiveness has already taken hold. Herrera will be on the bench by May.\n\nGrade: A man in cowboy boots steps on a rake but finds a 100-dollar bill on the ground.\n\nNashville SC, under the tutelage of the GOAT USMNT manager BJ Callaghan, went into last year’s first-round playoff matchup against Inter Miami all bluster and bravado. “We won’t be scared of Messi!” they assured us. Well, they ought to have been. Despite eking out a win in the second of the three-game series at Geodis Park, Nashville finished well and truly clowned in the two matches played in Miami.\n\nInter Miami successfully negated the Hany Mukhtar-Sam Surridge pipeline, which left Nashville with few ideas in attack and rendered them all but toothless. The Heron’s offensive firepower was unmatchable; Nashville had no chance of winning a match that turned into a basketball game.\n\nWith Jacob “Maple Messi” Shaffleburg shuffling off to LAFC, Nashville found themselves in need of a dynamic playmaker to complement Mukhtar and Surridge. When the San Jose Earthquakes inexplicably moved on from Argentinean winger Cristian Espinoza, the opportunity was too great to pass up.\n\nThe Earthquakes could have picked up Espinoza’s option for a sixth year, but declined it in favor of letting him walk. It’s a rare thing to have a marquee, Designated Player-quality forward player simply fall into your lap, but that’s more or less what transpired with Espinoza. But there’s more to the story than San Jose making a simple business decision.\n\nOn a recent episode of the “Unfiltered Soccer” podcast, Landon Donovan hit us with the shocking revelation: the San Jose Earthquakes simply “forgot” to trigger the option for the final year of Espinoza’s contract. Donovan insisted that manager Bruce Arena desperately wanted to retain the winger, but that someone on the roster-building side of San Jose’s operation screwed the pooch and inadvertently let Espinoza become a free agent.\n\nHis numbers were down last year but only slightly, and he still managed to find the net four times and provide another nine assists. At 30 years old, Espinoza still has plenty to offer in MLS, not least because he’s hardly a pace merchant. His technical ability and penchant for combining in the final third makes a front three of Mukhtar, Surridge, and Espinoza a tasty prospect.\n\nGrade: The Pentagon successfully lobbies for an increase in funding.\n\nInter Miami seemed to be doing a sort of bizarre TikTok challenge when they repeatedly downgraded their goalkeepers but managed to keep on winning. Drake Callender suffered a sports hernia and was sidelined for much of 2024. Callender had been instrumental in Miami’s run to the 2023 Leagues Cup title, and had by this point broken through with the USMNT to the degree that some had him pegged as a threat to become the nation’s starting keeper.\n\nThe club had the chance to reintegrate Callender in late 2025, but they baffled expectations when they decided to ride with Argentinean Oscar Ustari, whose sole claim to fame was that he happened to be on the 2008 Olympics team when Lionel Messi won a gold medal.\n\nUstari, thanks to being very old, suffered a hamstring injury in the lead-up to last year’s playoffs, at which point the Herons were forced to make due with the 23-year-old American-born Argentina youth international Rocco Rios Novo. Rios Novo played well enough as Inter Miami captured an MLS Cup for the first time in club history. But he never made any saves that made you get out of your seat, nor did he save Messi and Co.’s bacon in any pivotal moments.\n\nImagine Inter Miami with a bonafide shot-stopper? Well that’s what they’re getting in Canada’s No. 1, Dayne St. Clair. Having represented Minnesota United nearly 150 times, St. Clair has established himself as the preeminent goalkeeper from north of the border, and playing in Dade County with Messi will only heap on the pressure and expectations ahead of this year’s World Cup on home soil. St. Clair turned heads in the 2024 Leagues Cup group stage against Necaxa, when he kept a clean sheet and recorded an eye-popping 16 saves en route to a 1-0 victory, despite the Loons playing for the better part of 70 minutes a man down.\n\nPerhaps the signing of St. Clair will spur Inter forth to the CONCACAF Champions Cup that has eluded them. He’s got a strong presence in the penalty area to deal with all sorts of set piece shenanigans, decent distribution, and an excellent track record of saving penalties. It’s hard to imagine the juggernaut of South Florida getting even better, but employing a top-five MLS goalkeeper and turning a position of weakness to one of strength is going to make them nigh-impossible to beat in 2026.\n\nGrade: You bought the expensive duct tape this time, and you’re pretty sure it’s gonna hold up.\n\nChicago Fire FC earned accolades last season when they bucked the franchise-defining trend of being absolutely terrible. In addition to new manager Gregg Berhalter, a bevy of big signings played a significant role in the club’s return to the playoffs last year.\n\nJonathan Bamba, Hugo Cuypers, and Phillip Zinckernagel, aside from having fantastic names, breathed new life into a previously turgid attack. The Fire notched 68 goals last year, 28 more than the season prior and second in the East only to Inter Miami’s 81. But while their offense turned prolific, their defense was leaky, as evidenced when they crashed out of the first round of the playoffs with a 3-0 loss to the Philadelphia Union at home.\n\nMbekezeli Mbokazi is only 20 and has already established himself as a full South African international. He became the youngest captain in Orlando Pirates history in the first round of the African Champions League last season, and was nominated for the CAF Young Player of the Year in what amounted to a breakout season.\n\nBut as common footballing logic goes, the age of 20 is mighty green for a center back. MLS attackers tend to be large and fast, and Mbokazi stands at only 5 feet, 10 inches. How will he cope with a more physically-demanding, faster paced game than he is used to in South Africa?\n\nA September 2025 World Cup qualifier against Nigeria might hold the key to answering this tricky query. Faced with a vaunted, fleet-of-foot Nigerian front line containing the likes of Adamola Lookman and Alex Iwobi, Mbokazi turned in a Man of the Match performance in Blomfontaine to secure a 1-1 draw and a valuable point which helped South Africa secure the top spot of Group C.\n\nDisplaying a maturity and comfort on the ball well beyond his age, Mbokazi figures to be a key component of South Africa’s first World Cup appearance since they hosted in 2010. He also had a fantastic display against a Mo Salah-led Egypt in the recent AFCON tournament. Although South Africa lost 1-0, his performance drew some significant attention and even had his coach saying he deserved to be playing in a top league.\n\nWho knows if Mbokazi can help the Chicago Fire lock down some of its defensive issues. But if he can improve their goals-against figures by, let’s say 10 goals, Chicago figures to be among the top finishers in this year’s Eastern Conference.",

    "description": "Who fills the Vikings GM job will be an ongoing mystery for a minimum of three months. Burn through all […]",
    "fullText": "Who fills the Vikings GM job will be an ongoing mystery for a minimum of three months. Burn through all of February, March, and April. Afterwards, Minnesota will work toward filling the now vacated job.\n\nGone is Kwesi Adofo-Mensah. Whoever fills his shoes will be someone who gets the final call on signings, trades, and drafting players. Or, at least, that’s the early preference from Vikings co-owner Mark Wilf, who was speaking on behalf of the team’s ownership group at the end of last week. Check it out: “I would tell you, we do lean toward the fact to have a traditional role where the GM is the decision maker with extremely heavy input from the head coach and the coaching staff. So, we like that structure, that’s how we’re going to approach it going forward.”\n\nFor a little while, the Vikings had a different way of doing things.\n\nIndeed, former GM Rick Spielman shared power before becoming the one to get final say. Consider how the NFL website described the previous arrangement prior to 2012: “Spielman was promoted from his previous role as vice president of player personnel, which he held since his hire in May 2006. He will now have final authority over all roster-related decisions, in addition to his previous duties running the scouting departments and the draft, instead of the by-committee approach to player transactions.”\n\nEssentially, Minnesota’s ownership group has learned from past mistakes.\n\nThe path going forward involves centralizing power in one person. Doing so allows for clarity of direction under someone who is entrusted with being a strong, decisive leader and not a dictator. Proceed with confident humility, gleaning insight from the coaching staff alongside the scouts, numbers nerds, and so on before making what will ideally be the correct decisions to compete.\n\nFolks, that’s the best path forward.\n\nClipping a bird’s wings before there’s ever a chance to fly is cruel. Put differently, disarming the incoming GM — whoever it ends up being — before allowing that GM to get the final say makes zero sense. Some risk is involved since choosing the wrong person means empowering someone who will go on to make bad decisions. In contrast, nailing the decision will mean setting up the franchise for success.\n\nNote, as well, that the Vikings actually need to compete for talent. The obvious detail is apparent when free agency gets going, but it applies for executives, too. Some candidates would probably excuse themselves from the competition if word emerged of not getting the final call on personnel decisions.\n\nIn fairness, some of the talent has already been scooped up by teams that fired their GMs earlier in the offseason process. But, crucially, Minnesota will be in a nice position hire a promising GM when the time arrives.\n\nThe incoming decision maker is going to inherit a roster that boasts Justin Jefferson, one of the true elite talents in the NFL. Even better is that the team offers other stars: Brian O’Neill, Christian Darrisaw, Jonathan Greenard, Andrew Van Ginkel, and many others.\n\nInheriting Kevin O’Connell and Brian Flores should also be seen as a positive. Those coaches are better than most, ensuring a sturdy baseline of competitiveness that an incoming GM should welcome.\n\nThe discouraging, difficult reality is that quarterback is unsettled. In time, perhaps, J.J. McCarthy will prove to be the franchise passer. After 2025, though, that’s a major question mark. The good news is that the incoming hire will get the final call at who is lining up under center (after running the decision by ownership and after hearing from Coach O’Connell, of course).\n\nDirectly in front of the Vikings is getting the budget in shape — read: cuts, trades, restructures, and extensions — before jumping into free agency in March and the 2026 NFL Draft in April. Afterwards, a new GM will get hired.",

    "fullText": "Patriots get price tag for potential A.J. Brown trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots are gearing up for their first Super Bowl since the 2018 season, and their first under first-year head coach Mike Vrabel and second-year quarterback Drake Maye.\n\nOf course, the Super Bowl is the one thing on the mind of the Patriots and their fans, but they could have their cake and eat it too by winning another championship and pulling off a massive trade this offseason.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles star receiver A.J. Brown is very likely to get traded this offseason. New England has been labeled a potential landing spot for the All-Pro pass-catcher due to their need for a No. 1 star receiver, as well as Brown's connection to Vrabel, as the two were together with the Tennessee Titans. In terms of what it would potentially cost the Patriots, Tyler Sullivan of CBS Sports says a package of third and fifth-round picks.\n\n\"When Philadelphia acquired Brown from the Titans in 2022, the Eagles sent the No. 18 overall pick in that year's draft to Tennessee,\" Sullivan writes. \"Getting a first (or maybe even a second) at this stage of Brown's career seems a little too far-fetched, particularly with his age and contract situation (signed through 2029 and due $29 million in guarantees next season). Brown also appeared to lose a step in 2025, notably dropping some key balls in that playoff defeat to San Francisco. That may also make some prospective teams a bit skittish about trading blue-chip draft capital for him.\"\n\nIf the price for Brown is that low, there will be several teams blowing up the phone of Howie Roseman, and the Patriots will almost certainly be one of those teams trying to acquire the star wideout.\n\nBuffalo Bills now know the asking price for A.J.

    "fullText": "The much-discussed meeting between undefeated featherweights Movsar Evloev and Lerone Murphy is official to headline UFC London on March 21 at the O2 Arena in London, England.\n\nEvloev and Murphy are widely considered to be the two top contenders in the UFC's 145-pound division. Both men were expected to be in the running to challenge UFC champion Alexander Volkanovski. However, that role was ultimately given to Diego Lopes for the second time in nine months at UFC 325 — a decision met by significant controversy.\n\nVolkanovski dispatched Lopes with another one-sided decision this past Saturday in Sydney, Australia, then advocated for one of either Evloev or Murphy to be his next challenger. As such, it's very likely that the winner of UFC London's main event will move on to challenge Volkanovski in the summer.\n\nEvloev (19-0) is a perfect 9-0 under the UFC umbrella, but his rise has been slowed by long stretches of inactivity. The 31-year-old Russian has been sidelined since a December 2024 win over former featherweight champion Aljamain Sterling. He also holds notable victories over Lopes and Arnold Allen.\n\nMurphy (17-0-1) is also 9-0-1 inside the UFC, a run culminating with a highlight-reel spinning back elbow knockout of Aaron Pico this past August that captured Uncrowned's Knockout of the Year award. Included among Murphy's undefeated run are wins over veteran contenders Josh Emmett, Dan Ige and Edson Barboza.\n\nThe official UFC London fight card can be seen below.\n\nFeatherweight: Movsar Evloev vs. Lerone Murphy\n\nFeatherweight: Luke Riley vs. Michael Aswell.\n\nWelterweight: Michael Page vs. Sam Patterson\n\nLight heavyweight: Iwo Baraniewski vs. Austen Lane\n\nMiddleweight: Roman Dolidze vs. Christian Leroy Duncan\n\nFeatherweight: Danny Silva vs. Kurtis Campbell\n\nLightweight: Mason Jones vs. Axel Sola\n\nFeatherweight: Nathaniel Wood vs. Losene Keita\n\nHeavyweight: Louie Sutherland vs. Brando Pericic\n\nMiddleweight: Mantas Kondratavicius vs. Antonio Trocoli\n\nHeavyweight: Mick Parkin vs. Mario Pinto\n\nLightweight: Shem Rock vs. Abdul-Kareem Al-Sewady\n\nStrawweight: Shanelle Dyer vs. Ravena Oliveira",

That list includes Greg Roman, Frank Reich, and Darrell Bevell.\n\nAll three candidates possess previous experience coordinating NFL offenses.\n\nJets Wire has ranked them from best to worst.\n\nGreg Roman spent the previous two campaigns coordinating the Los Angeles Chargers offense for Jim Harbaugh. He previously worked under John Harbaugh with the Baltimore Ravens and was key throughout Lamar Jackson's formative years. Roman failed to maximize Justin Herbert in L.A., but his track record is better than the alternatives.\n\nFrank Reich has been the overwhelming favorite to become Aaron Glenn's coordinator and play caller. Reich enjoyed a fairly successful stint as the Indianapolis Colts' head coach (2018-22), but the follow-up job he did with the Carolina Panthers was disastrous. A decision could arrive this week.\n\nDarrell Bevell was Pete Carroll's long-term offensive coordinator with the Seattle Seahawks. Since then, his reputation has taken a negative turn. Bevell coordinated a bad Detroit Lions offense in 2020 before becoming their interim head coach following Matt Patricia's midseason firing, and the same thing happened to him in 2021 in Jacksonville with Urban Meyer.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Ranking the Jets' 3 OC candidates from best to worst",

    "description": "Detroit Lions DT Levi Onwuzurike is still under contract for 2026 due to a rare CBA rule.",
    "fullText": "Detroit Lions defensive tackle Levi Onwuzurike signed a one-year deal last offseason, meaning the expectation is that he’ll face free agency in 2026 when the new league year starts in March.\n\nHowever, that’s not how it’s working with Onwuzurike. Due to a lesser-known rule in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Onwuzurike’s one-year contract will toll over to 2026, meaning he’s under contract in Detroit and will remain so when the new league year hits.\n\nAs you may remember, Onwuzurike re-signed with the team in March, just before free agency started. But before Onwuzurike could even practice in training camp, Lions coach Dan Campbell announced that Onwuzurike was out for the year with a torn ACL. The Lions opted to put him on the Physically Unable to Perform reserve list, not the injured reserve list. That distinction turns out to be critical.\n\nBecause there is a stipulation in the CBA that a player who is on the final year of his contract and spends the entire season on the PUP/reserve list will see their contract toll over to the next year. In essence, Onwuzurike’s contract was paused in 2025 and will now carry over to the 2026 season.\n\nHere is the provision, in Article 20, Section 2 of the CBA:\n\nSection 2. Physically Unable to Perform\n\nAny player placed on a Physically Unable to Perform list (“PUP”) will be paid his full Paragraph 5 Salary while on such list. His contract will not be tolled for the period he is on PUP, except in the last year of his contract, when the player’s contract will be tolled if (i) he is still physically unable to perform his football services as of the sixth regular season game; and (ii) he is not reinstated to the Club’s Active/Inactive List during that regular season or postseason. For the avoidance of doubt, if the player returns to practice, but is never reinstated to the Club’s Active/Inactive List during that regular season or postseason, his contract will toll.\n\nSo, as it appears over on Over The Cap, Onwuzurike is essentially under contract for the 2026 season on a one-year deal, $1.5 million contract—just above the league minimum—with an opportunity to gain more money on per-game roster bonuses.\n\nIt’s one more opportunity for Onwuzurike, who has seen his career largely derailed by injury. After missing the entire 2022 season and much of 2023 with a back injury, Onwuzurike appeared to put it all behind him for a promising 2024 season. But the ACL injury threw another wrench into his young career. Since being drafted in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft, Onwuzurike has played in 41 games (10 starts) and accumulated 68 tackles, 3.5 sacks, 16 QB hits, and a forced fumble.",

    "description": "Levi Onwuzurike’s season ended before it began, but a CBA provision allows the Detroit Lions to carry his contract into the 2026 season.",
    "fullText": "According to a report from Justin Rogers, the Detroit Lions thought they had pulled off a sneaky-good move when they brought back Levi Onwuzurike on a one-year deal after his breakout 2024 season. Unfortunately, that plan unraveled quickly when lingering knee issues turned into a full-blown ACL injury, ending his season before training camp even got rolling.\n\nWhat looked like a clean one-year gamble suddenly felt like a loss, until the fine print of the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement stepped in.\n\nBecause Onwuzurike was placed on the Nonfootball Injury (NFI) list while in the final year of his contract, his deal will officially toll, meaning it rolls forward to the 2026 season. A team source confirmed that Detroit will retain control of Onwuzurike under the same contract terms next year.\n\nThat’s a big deal for a player who finally put it all together in 2024.\n\nAfter battling a serious back injury early in his career — including a lumbar fusion that wiped out his entire 2022 season — Onwuzurike finally stayed healthy last year. He appeared in 16 games, made 10 starts, logged 635 snaps, and consistently disrupted quarterbacks, finishing with 28 tackles and 45 pressures.\n\nDetroit clearly believed more was coming, which is why the team re-signed him to a one-year, $4 million deal that could have reached $5.5 million with incentives. Instead, the ACL injury shut everything down before Week 1.\n\nNow, thanks to the tolling provision, the Lions essentially get a reset. Onwuzurike remains under contract for 2026 with a fully guaranteed $1.5 million base salary and up to $500,000 in per-game bonuses, giving Detroit another chance to see if his 2024 breakout was just the beginning.\n\nIt’s not how anyone wanted it to play out — but for the Lions, it quietly keeps a high-upside defensive lineman in the building for another year.\n\nThe post Levi Onwuzurike Injury Triggers Contract Tolling for Detroit Lions appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

This veteran has worked 61 Cup races as a crew chief with various teams,  267 O'Reilly Auto Parts Series (NOAPS) races, and 62 Craftsman Truck Series (NCTS) races. He has five wins as a crew chief in NOAPS, ending the 2009 season as the championship runner-up with Carl Edwards.\n\nEddie Pardue will partner with reigning ARCA Menards Series champion Brenden Queen in the No. 12 truck, working 33 Cup races, 384 NOAPS races, and 22 Truck races. He is also a proven winner in the O'Reilly Series, earning three wins during the 2009 season.\n\nMike Hillman Jr. will partner with Justin Haley in the No. 16 truck, and is perhaps the most experienced crew chief on this list. He has spent 30 years in the top level of the sport sitting atop the pit box for 402 Cup races the pit box, as well as 107 O'Reilly races, and 39 Truck races. As a crew chief, he won four NOAPS races (1988 and 1990) and two NCTS races (2004).\n\nBruce Cook will lead the driver who wins the RAM: Race For The Seat competition in the No. 14, and Alex Yontz will work with the rotating driver roster in the all-star No. 25 truck.\n\nCook has 134 NOAPS races and 122 NCTS races as a crew chief, which includes one O'Reilly win and six Truck wins all during the 2011 season. Yontz has 217 O'Reilly races under his belt, all with Kaulig Racing so he will be in a familiar position in 2026 -- just a different series. Nine of Kaulig's NOAPS victories came with Yontz atop the pit box, and with four different drivers.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star closer Edwin Diaz will play in the 2026 World Baseball Classic, per Primera Hora.\n\nDiaz’s commitment to the tournament comes amid controversy among Puerto Rico and other Latin American counties in regards to the WBC, with leaders claiming the insurance decisions are unfair.\n\n“In some ways, I think it’s a little bit unfair,” Joey Sola, Team Puerto Rico’s operations manager, said. “Especially when you are three days from submitting your final roster. Who in the world would think Lindor wasn’t on the (eligible) list? You wait until the last weekend to get an answer on Lindor? C’mon.\n\n“It took us by surprise. I know the WBC isn’t in those decisions. It’s the insurance companies. But you have guys on other teams, they have an injury history and then I got guys on my roster who will be playing at the Double-A level with no (major-league) guarantee, no MLB invitation (to spring training), and they get flagged. And guys on other teams who can play in the WBC are earning $30 million per year. It’s kind of tough to understand it.”\n\n2026 will be Diaz’s third WBC, having played in both 2017 and 2023. The All-Star tore his right patellar tendon in the 2023 tournament while celebrating Puerto Rico’s victory over the Dominican Republic. He went on to miss the entirety of the 2023 MLB season.\n\nThe World Baseball Classic runs from March 5-17, so no matter how Team Puerto Rico performs, Diaz should be back in time for the beginning of the Dodgers’ regular season.\n\nThe All-Star, who signed a three-year, $69 million deal with the Dodgers this offseason, will be a key part of the roster for the upcoming year, and will look to stay healthy throughout the tournament so he can help is new team come April.\n\nDiaz is entering his age-32 season and is coming off one of his best years in MLB in 2025. The right-hander featured in 62 games last season and pitched 66.1 innings, posting a 1.63 ERA while striking out 98 batters throughout the campaign.\n\nOther than Diaz, five Dodgers are currently slated to play in the WBC. Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Shohei Ohtani headline a stacked Team Japan roster heading into the tournament as they look for their second consecutive title.\n\nWill Smith will play catcher for Team USA in the tournament and will pair up with a familiar face in Clayton Kershaw, who shockingly announced his participation after retiring at the end of the 2025 MLB season.\n\nThe final player who has declared for the WBC is Hyeseong Kim, who will play for Team Korea.\n\nMore Dodgers can still feature in the upcoming tournament, though, as teams will announce their full rosters Thursday at 4:00 p.m. PT.",

    "fullText": "Fresh reports out of Italy have added intrigue to the January window, with Sandro Tonali at the centre of renewed speculation involving Arsenal and Newcastle United. Sources close to the situation have moved quickly to address the noise, as claims circulated that the midfielder had been offered to Mikel Arteta’s side.\n\nSky in Italy and Sky Sports News have both clarified that no such approach has been made, nor has any formal enquiry been lodged. That clarity has come directly from Tonali’s representative, Giuseppe Riso, who has spoken publicly to put the matter to bed.\n\nRiso left little room for interpretation when speaking on the record. He said: “Newcastle won’t let Sandro go in January. We never spoke with Arsenal about this opportunity.” Those words are understood to reflect the firm stance at St James’ Park, where the club see Tonali as a central pillar of their long term project.\n\nDespite a swirl of headlines, Newcastle remain focused on building around their midfield core. There has been no bid, no enquiry and no green light for discussions. Internally, the message is that Tonali is settled, committed and valued highly, even as Europe’s elite continue to monitor his progress.\n\nFrom Newcastle’s perspective, the January window is about consolidation rather than upheaval. Eddie Howe’s squad has navigated a demanding first half of the season and the hierarchy are keen to avoid disruption. Allowing a player of Tonali’s profile to leave midway through a campaign would be counterproductive, especially with European qualification again in sight.\n\nSky Sports News understands that Newcastle have not received any contact from Arsenal regarding the Italian international. That aligns with Riso’s statement and reinforces the club’s confidence that their asset is not on the market, regardless of outside chatter.\n\nWhile Arsenal have been linked in some quarters, those claims have now been dismissed. Riso was also asked about potential interest from Juventus, another club often associated with elite Italian talent. His reply was equally measured, saying: “It’s not the right moment to talk.” That suggests any future discussions are firmly on hold, with Tonali’s focus squarely on his current club.\n\nFor now, the story appears settled. Newcastle United retain their midfielder, Arsenal move on to other targets and Tonali continues his work on Tyneside without distraction. In a window defined by speculation, this is one rumour that has been conclusively closed.",

Both Stade Brestois and Metz were interested in signing the centre-forward. The latter currently sit rock bottom of Ligue 1, however, this is the option that has been favoured by the Principality club. It is hoped that there he will have the game time in order to further his developpment. There is no buy option included in the deal.\n\nThere could be another departure in the forward department before the end of the window, with George Ilenikhena nearing a €33m move to Al-Ittihad.",

    "fullText": "Jets' rounds 1-2 prediction from ESPN would be near-perfect draft class originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Jets have a lot of work to do this offseason. Aside from filling out their new-look coaching staff, the Jets also need to nail their free agent spending and their draft picks this offseason.\n\nThey're not going to get the top quarterback in Fernando Mendoza, but with a huge hole at the position, a QB down the board isn't out of the question. But, they're much more than a QB away from competing for a playoff spot.\n\nThat's why ESPN's Matt Miller's mock draft for Rounds 1 and 2 would be a near-perfect scenario for the Jets. Not only do they land incredible talent at positions of need, but they don't overspend on any player in the class.\n\nAt the second overall pick, Miller has the Jets taking Ohio State edge rusher Arvell Reese. With a huge hole at QB, Miller elects to go with a pass rusher for the Jets.\n\nWhy? \"After ranking 31st in sacks this season (26),\" Miller writes, \"New York needs a primary pass rusher who will scare offenses.\"\n\nReese will do just that, as he's one of the best defensive players in the class, and while he split time at linebacker, the development of Micah Parsons and Abdul Carter in the NFL is the reason not worry about this selection.\n\nThen, down the board at pick 16, Miller has the Jets going offense. Except, it's not a quarterback. He has the Jets taking USC wide receiver Makai Lemon.\n\nWhile Garrett Wilson is a great number one WR, the Jets need more weapons for a quarterback, and Lemon, at 5-foot-11, 195 pounds, with some incredible toughness and playmaking ability, would be a great addition to the WR room.\n\nThe Jets then pick 33rd overall, and Miller still isn't going QB. Instead, he has the Jets taking a Quinnen Williams replacement in Ohio State DT Kayden McDonald.\n\n\"McDonald projects as a starter-level nose tackle or 1-technique with the power to keep the linebackers behind him clean and run lanes stuffed,\" Miller writes.\n\nMcDonald is a nice addition for the Jets, and combined with Reese, the Jets would be adding two Ohio State defenders inside the top 33 picks, both of which would be huge upgrades for the defense, which struggled big-time in 2025.\n\nMore: Jets predicted to draft 'high-ceiling' QB prospect in first round by Mel Kiper Jr.\n\nAnd then, with the Jets 44rd pick in the second round, Miller finally goes quarterback with Alabama's Ty Simpson.\n\n\"Simpson doesn't have a Round 1 grade on my board, and I couldn't find a single team that would give him one during conversations at the Senior Bowl,\" Miller writes.\n\nInstead of the Jets panicking and getting overly aggressive, taking Simpson (or another QB) in the first round, they take Simpson in the middle of the second round in this mock draft from Miller.\n\nWhile Simpson might not be fully ready to be an NFL starter, this draft pick is much more excusable to take a low-floor, high-ceiling QB prospect at.\n\nOverall, Miller has the Jets taking with picks 2, 16, 33, and 44: ED Arvell Reese, WR Makai Lemon, DT Kayden McDonald, and QB Ty Simpson.\n\nComing out of the draft with a top pass rusher, a top wide receiver, a great interior defensive lineman, and a flier at the QB position would be a nearly perfect way to go about the first two rounds for the Jets.\n\nJets linked to $180 million QB to replace Justin Fields after failed $40M experiment\n\nJets expected to replace Justin Fields with two quarterbacks in NFL Draft, free agency\n\nJets get bad news on possible trade-up with Raiders for first overall pick\n\nNFL insider takes subtle jab at Jets with Titans hiring Robert Saleh as head coach\n\nDante Moore staying at Oregon rumor is terrible look for New York Jets\n\nJets named top landing spot for 1,100-yard rusher if Breece Hall departs in free agency",

    "fullText": "Millions of dollars have been raised for Bondi hero Ahmed al-Ahmed, while campaigns are backing families hit by Victoria’s bushfires. What does this way of giving mean for the charity sector?\n\nWithin hours of the Bondi beach terror attack, the money had already begun to pour in. As images of the tragedy flooded social media, people from around the world donated tens of thousands of dollars to the victims, their families and first responders.\n\nPassing the hat around the neighbourhood or the local pub has always been a staple response in times of crisis. But today, that instinct to open your wallet has been exponentially supercharged via a digital simulacrum: online crowdfunding platforms.\n\nGoFundMe fundraisers have since raised more than $3m for Ahmed al-Ahmed, who tackled and disarmed one of the gunmen before he suffered three gunshot wounds to his shoulder. Among dozens of other appeals in the wake of the shooting, $1m has also been raised for the family of the youngest victim, 10-year-old Matilda.\n\nAnd this month, as unprecedented bushfires swept through regional communities in Victoria, crowdfunding campaigns shot up to help families rebuild from the ashes.\n\n“During times of mass catastrophe, we can easily feel overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness in witnessing such extraordinary harms,” says Dr Matthew Wade, a sociology and ethics researcher at La Trobe University.\n\nIf helplessness is the ailment, then crowdfunding can feel like the antidote. Donating directly to an individual or cause via a crowdfunding platform is a tangible action to alleviate someone’s suffering, offering donors a sense of immediate impact that donating to a conventional charity can’t easily replicate, Wade says.\n\nSince the globally dominant online crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe, launched in Australia in 2015, Australians have donated more than $1.1bn to causes on the platform. Worldwide, more than $40bn has been donated since it was founded in 2010 in the US. Unlike a charity, GoFundMe is a for-profit company, charging transaction fees on donations and encouraging donors to leave an optional tip. The company says this model allows it to provide a secure, user-friendly service at scale.\n\nAccording to GoFundMe, nearly one in five Australians now make their first ever charitable donation on the platform; a figure that rises to 40% among gen Z. At the same time, the share of Australians making tax-deductible donations – usually only applicable to money given to conventional charities – has fallen from 35% in 2013 to 28% in 2023. In the digital age, the dynamics of giving are changing.\n\nBeyond supporting victims of tragedy, crowdfunding platforms host appeals for an extraordinary range of causes, from legal defence funds and relocation costs to vet bills and recreational travel costs. Some resonate widely; others attract criticism or go largely unnoticed.\n\nMedical fundraisers are the most common on GoFundMe. In some sense they are no different from a manager doing a whip around the office for a sick employee, only more efficient, sharable and with far greater reach.\n\nIt’s a system that’s proved hugely successful and life-changing for some, but statistically, is much more likely to fail. One analysis estimated that just 17% of US GoFundMe campaigns for health care and emergency costs meet their fundraising goal. Wade says this highlights the “wildly diverging outcomes” propagated by crowdfunding platforms.\n\n“Of course during desperate times any donations are better than none at all, but it can come at a significant personal cost in forgoing privacy and placing oneself in an incredibly vulnerable position in appealing to the crowd for the moral worthiness of yourself or a loved one,” he says.\n\nWith the power to decide – consciously or algorithmically – which campaigns are promoted, permitted or removed, crowdfunding platforms have become the arbiters of which causes are deemed acceptable, and which are not. According to an Al Jazeera report, GoFundMe has been accused of blocking millions of dollars of life-saving aid from reaching Gaza. In a statement, a GoFundMe spokesperson called the allegations “categorically false”.\n\nMeanwhile, $1.5m has been raised on the platform for Renee Nicole Good’s family and widow after she was shot dead in Minneapolis by ICE immigration officer Jonathan Ross. The platform is hosting a campaign to support Ross too, raising more than $793k at the time of writing.\n\nThose who become symbols of a cause – captured on video or framed as heroes – can attract overwhelming support, as do people with large social networks and the ability to craft an impactful appeal, while others affected by the same event receive little or nothing.\n\nThese disparities raise broader questions about the proliferation of crowdfunding in areas traditionally covered by the state. In 2022, the then MP Petter Dutton was criticised for launching a GoFundMe for flood victims in his local electorate rather than using government resources to distribute aid.\n\n“The point of having state-based compensation for victims of violence and disaster is precisely to prevent them from having to advocate for the value of their own lives during times of immense suffering and anguish,” Wade says.\n\nIn the crowdfunding age, donations can flow to any individual who, however well-meaning, may be unequipped to distribute large sums of money to where it’s needed most, says Prof Wendy Scaife, a philanthropy and fundraising expert at the Queensland University of Technology.\n\nFor this reason, Scaife says crowdfunding has been a “mixed blessing” for the charity sector. On one hand it can help bring in more revenue; about 5% of money raised on GoFundMe in Australia has gone towards a registered charity, and the platform offers charities a secure way to fundraise quickly and at scale, reaching donors they otherwise traditionally couldn’t.\n\nBut on the other, Scaife says it has the potential to divert donations away from where they could have more impact, particularly in the wake of natural disasters.\n\n“After bushfires it’ll be a tiny grassroots animal organisation, it will see millions come through the door and they don’t have the capacity to spend it,” Scaife says. “It sounds like a nice problem to have but it’s not.”\n\nInstead, in most cases Scaife recommends donating to reputable charities to get money to where it’s needed most. “They know what works and what doesn’t, they know how to place money for impact.”\n\nBut adds: “Giving to individuals is perfectly sound too, and more so if it was your local area and you really know those people, or you wanted that connection.”\n\nWhether or not donations made to crowdfunding platforms displace or supplement money that people would otherwise give to charities, however, is unclear. Krystian Seibert, the executive director of policy at Philanthropy Australia, says it’s a possibility. “If people give more using one method, then they may give less using another,” he says.\n\nAccording to its survey findings, GoFundMe posits that 40% of people are “more charitable” after using their platform for the first time, suggesting the platform is a gateway to a more altruistic lifestyle.\n\nSeibert says while the link between giving to crowdfunding campaigns and charities is complex, having multiple convenient avenues for donating can help build a “culture of giving”. “Generally, if people get into the habit of giving, they’ll want to give more,” he says.\n\nPeter Singer has spent a good chunk of his life pressing the case of giving to others. Often bestowed as the world’s most influential living philosopher, Singer is a key supporter of the effective altruism movement, which uses evidence and research to determine where the keenest need is, and the most impactful ways to help the most people.\n\nSinger applauds people’s compassion for donating to crowdfunding campaigns. “But I wish donors would also use their head as well as their hearts, and try to do the most good with the money they have,” he says.\n\nAlthough the proportion of Australians making tax-deductible donations to charities is falling, the total amount of money donated each year is rising, largely due to rising donations from corporates and the ultra wealthy. Even so, Singer argues we must give more.\n\nLike many effective altruists, he advocates for people living in wealthy countries to donate at least 10% of their income to highly impactful charities. In Australia, the average percentage of income donated to an individual in need, charity or religious group is 0.73%, according to the 2025 World Giving Report.\n\n“Many Australians have the ability to give and I would encourage them to do so,” he says. “It’s something that can make our lives better, by feeling that we are doing something meaningful with what we’ve got.”",

    "fullText": "180716494\n story\n\n Long-time Slashdot reader destinyland writes: Just months after his 20th birthday, Bill Gates had already angered the programmer community,\" remembers this 50th-anniversary commemoration of Gates' Open Letter to Hobbyists. \"As the first home computers began appearing in the 1970s, the world faced a question: Would its software be free?\"\n\nGates railed in 1976 that \"Most of you steal your software.\" Gates had coded the BASIC interpreter for Altair's first home computer with Paul Allen and Monte Davidoff — only to see it pirated by Steve Wozniak's friends at the Homebrew Computing Club. Expecting royalties, a none-too-happy Gates issued his letter in the club's newsletter (as well as Altair's own publication), complaining \"I would appreciate letters from any one who wants to pay up.\"\n\nBut freedom-loving coders had other ideas. When Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs released their Apple 1 home computer that summer, they stressed that \"our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost...\" And early open-source hackers began writing their own free Tiny Basic interpreters to create a free alternative to the Gates/Micro-Soft code. This led to the first occurrence of the phrase \"Copyleft\" in October of 1976.\n\nOpen Source definition author Bruce Perens shares his thoughts today. \"When I left Pixar in 2000, I stopped in Steve Job's office — which for some reason was right across the hall from mine... \" Perens remembered. \"I asked Steve: 'You still don't believe in this Linux stuff, do you...?'\" And Perens remembers how that movement finally won over Steve Jobs and carried the day. \"Three years later, Steve stood onstage in front of a slide that said 'Open",

Rachel Martin, the course director, told Business Insider that instructors deliberately use drones against students so they understand just \"what it's like to be hunted by another operator from an adversary force: what it sounds like, what it feels like, how often they need to displace in order to survive or not be observed.\"\n\nThat matters because \"the minute you're observed, you need to move,\" she said. \"What follows that is usually fires of some capacity,\" such as artillery.\n\nThe aim, she continued, is to simulate an enemy force actively searching for them and to test their reactions \"so they get used to one being hunted by the enemy.\"\n\nUkraine and other recent conflicts have shown the Army how inexpensive drones can be turned into effective weapons capable of destroying systems worth millions of dollars and how vulnerable forces can be without that experience, Martin said.\n\nPreparing for that kind of war requires a mindset shift for US troops long used to controlling the air and less accustomed to looking up. In a future fight, that advantage may not exist, meaning anything overhead has to be treated as a potential threat.\n\n\"That is something we need to teach and ingrain in every soldier,\" Martin said.\n\nAnd there's little time for soldiers to think through whether something is friend or foe, she said. By the time you hear the sound, it may already be coming for you.\n\nCarl Larson, a US veteran of the war in Iraq who had fought in Ukraine, said at a drone conference last year that the mass of drones on the battlefield is \"incredibly corrosive to your ability to conduct combat operations.\" He said they hurt morale and hinder the ability to move around.\n\nHe said that many of the drones are \"damn near undetectable,\" explaining that \"they come in hot at over a hundred miles an hour,\" which leaves soldiers feeling vulnerable at all times. It's exhausting for troops to be constantly on edge.\n\nMartin shared that she had been personally targeted by one-way drones in Iraq and said \"the psychological aspect of it is real.\"\n\nIf Ukraine is anything to go by, future fights may be on another level, and experts say the US military needs to be prepared.\n\n\"Psychologically speaking, this is not what the US military is used to because the US military is used to controlling the air,\" Samuel Bendett, a drone expert with the Center for Naval Analyses, told Business Insider. In Ukraine, drones \"roam that airspace and present just absolutely a horrendous threat to the forces below.\" Kyiv's forces have been adapting to that for over three years.\n\n\"You need to train for the situations where you are going to be stressed all the time. You are going to be looking up all the time. You won't be able to relax normally,\" he said, predicting that soldiers will be on alert for the sound of quadcopter drones, \"which is the new nightmare fuel.\"\n\nUkrainian soldiers have described skies so crowded with drones that they're unable to figure out which side they belong to, sometimes leading to orders to engage any drone they see.\n\nThat saturation makes it difficult to stay safe, even far from the front lines. Soldiers resort to tactics like building fake positions and digging deeper trenches to avoid detection. It also slows advances and complicates evacuating wounded troops.\n\nMartin said that a key lesson they are imparting to students as a result is that \"we can't be a static army.\"\n\nIn this kind of environment, \"mobility is survivability. So we're trying to teach that concept that you may be in the observation post for a few minutes and then you're going to have to move, either to survive or to get a better picture of what's happening forward of you.\"\n\nIt means feeding back to the rest of the Army that \"they can't stay in the same place for very long.\"\n\nPlans for the future of the training course, which held its inaugural three-week session in August, include introducing more advanced tactics and complex scenarios. The Army also hopes graduates will return to their units as trainers themselves, with Fort Rucker serving as a hub for advanced instruction and a model that units can adapt into their own qualification programs.",

    "fullText": "Target's new CEO laid out a road map for success on his first workday in the top job.\n\nOn Monday, Michael Fiddelke sent out his first memo to staff as the new chief executive of the Minneapolis-based big-box retailer.\n\nIt outlined four priorities for the company, from elevating guest experience to investing in the team's growth.\n\nFiddelke climbed the company's career ladder, working his way up from an intern in 2003. Before his appointment as CEO, he was Target's chief operating officer. He replaced outgoing CEO Brian Cornell, who helmed the company since 2014.\n\nFiddelke is stepping into the role at a tense moment for the company. Target's stock price is down about 25% in the past year, and it is facing backlash from employees for its response to violence by immigration officers in Minneapolis.\n\nTo our Guests, Team Members and Business Partners,\n\nThis week marks my first as CEO, and I want to start by saying thank you.\n\nI began my career at Target more than two decades ago. I've grown here, learned here and worked alongside teams and partners who care deeply about our guests. Stepping into this role is both humbling and deeply personal.\n\nAnd while we have real work to do, we are clear on who we are, our unique place in retail and in the hearts of our guests. We are equally clear on the opportunity in front of us. Our guests want great design, real value and experiences that delight. That's where Target has always been at its best, and it's what grounds the important work in front of us now.\n\nAs we move forward, our strategy is focused on four priorities:\n\nIn the weeks ahead, my focus is simple: listen closely, move with clarity and urgency, and lead with purpose. We will make clear choices, invest where it matters most and bring this strategy to life through our stores, our digital experiences, and — most importantly — our people.\n\nTo our guests: we're committed to earning your trust and making every visit feel worth it.\n\nTo our team members: you are the heart of this company.\n\nTo our partners: we grow best when we build together.\n\nI'm excited for what we'll create — together.",

    "description": "Shirin Behzadi shares how fleeing Iran alone at 18 led her from gas station shifts to becoming the CEO of a billion-dollar company.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Shirin Behzadi, author of \"The Unexpected CEO: My Journey from Gas Station Cashier to Billion-Dollar CEO.\" It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy childhood in Iran was normal and stable. Then, when the Iranian Revolution started, chaos and violence were everywhere. I was arrested the first time when I was walking down the street. The second time, I was 15, and was arrested on charges of having a book. I can't even remember what the book was. The Revolutionary Guards who were arresting me were about my age themselves, and they were looking for anyone who was trying to educate themselves.\n\nAfter I graduated from high school at 17, my parents told me it was time for me to leave the country. Iran was no longer safe. I used to lie in bed, knowing that someone could knock on the door and take me away. My mother travelled with me to Turkey, but my parents weren't able to leave their homeland. I eventually immigrated to the US, alone, at 18.\n\nGetting into the US was difficult at the time for Iranians, because it was soon after the Iranian Hostage Crisis. I applied to college and was able to get a visa to attend. I'd been accepted to a private college, but I couldn't afford that, so soon after I immigrated, I transferred to a state school.\n\nMy parents were still in Iran, and I needed to support myself. I worked as a gas station cashier, spending shifts behind bulletproof glass. Because I didn't have kids or a family, the long, lonely shifts fell to me. I remember working on Christmas morning, alone and far from my family.\n\nStill, I knew I was going to make something of my life. One day, while working at the gas station, I created a business card for myself. I knew one day I would run a big company, and that gave me the drive to work full-time at the gas station while being enrolled full-time in college.\n\nAfter college, I started working at an accounting firm. I kept focused on my goal of running a big company. It wasn't a dream, it was a knowing: I was determined to get there.\n\nI moved up the ladder at the accounting firm, but I knew if I stayed there, I wouldn't run a company. So I left, taking a job in operations so I could learn more about how a large company runs. I became a chief financial officer and then CEO.\n\nAs CEO of Home Franchise Concepts, I oversaw the integration of private equity, which allowed the company to flourish. When I stepped down in 2019, the company was doing about $1 billion in revenue and had about 1,700 franchisees.\n\nSince those early days at the gas station, my career has been guided by my core values, including a commitment to caring for people. As a CEO and leader, I wanted to do well financially while also doing good for those in my community.\n\nThe same principle guided me as a mom. I wanted to be an engaged, nurturing mother to my son and daughter.\n\nMy kids grew up with a very different lifestyle than I did. And yet, everyone has challenges and changes in their lives, which, by definition, constitute adversity. I believe there's a superpower in adversity, because it allows you to learn. Whether it's living through immigration and revolution or navigating day-to-day hiccups, you can use your challenges to grow.",

    "description": "Disney on Monday revealed the impact of its carriage dispute with YouTube TV that left customers unable to access ESPN, among other channels.",
    "fullText": "Disney is counting the cost of its prolonged dust-up with YouTubeTV this past November.\n\nThe Mouse House said Monday that the carriage dispute, which saw Disney-owned channels, including ESPN, unavailable to watch on YouTube TV for 15 days, caused an approximately $110 million operating income hit to its sports segment in its most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nOverall operating income for its sports division came in at $191 million, down 23% from the year-ago quarter, the company said. The company said this reflected the YouTube TV fallout, higher programming and production costs, and a decrease in subscription and affiliate fees.\n\nThe showdown centered on a dispute over how much the Google-owned TV service was prepared to pay to carry ABC, ESPN, and Disney's other TV networks.\n\nDisney claimed YouTubeTV wasn't assigning a fair value to its content, including its highly valuable sports rights, such as \"Monday Night Football\" and college football. YouTube argued that paying higher rates would force it to raise prices for its own customers. (Google gave YouTube TV subscribers a $20 bill credit as the fight dragged on.)\n\nThe high-profile skirmish was the longest blackout in Disney's history.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley had estimated that Disney was losing $30 million in revenue a week, or about $4.3 million each day, from the YouTubeTV standoff. Disney's disclosure, which concerned bottom-line operating income and not topline revenue, suggested the impact was deeper.\n\nIn its earnings, Disney also disclosed that it had generated record streaming profits for the quarter, boosted by recent price increases. Overall, the company beat Wall Street expectations for both revenue and profit in the quarter.\n\nDisney's stock was down about 2% in premarket trading. The company warned it was only expecting \"modest\" profit growth in its parks business in the second quarter, due to a combination of factors, including \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks.\n\nThe US tourism industry has taken a blow in recent months amid trade frictions and geopolitical tensions. Visits to the US by international travelers declined for the eighth straight month in December, per the National Travel and Tourism Office.",

    "fullText": "Kevin Warsh checks a lot of boxes that Federal Reserve watchers care about.\n\nBut the top economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, says the real test is whether Warsh can keep politics out of interest rate decisions.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is a reasonable choice for the next Federal Reserve chair. His obvious strength is his previous stint on the Fed during the Global Financial Crisis. He knows the institution and everyone in global central banking circles,\" Zandi wrote in an X post on Sunday.\n\n\"But the critical question is whether he will be strong enough to ensure that interest rates are set based on the economy, and not politics,\" he added.\n\nZandi said this will not be an easy feat, given that President Donald Trump has been pressuring the Fed to lower rates.\n\nTrump also hopes the next Fed chair will consult him over future interest rate decisions, The Wall Street Journal reported in December.\n\n\"Warsh's ostensible views on the use of the Fed's balance sheet or its data dependency are quirky, even odd, but his legacy as Fed chair will be determined by how much of the Fed's independence he is able to preserve,\" Zandi said.\n\nWarsh spent his early career working at Morgan Stanley before becoming an economic advisor to President George W. Bush in 2002.\n\nHe served on the Fed's Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, after being nominated by Bush. His time there also overlapped with the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nZandi said these credentials show \"he is well-versed in financial markets, which is especially important when markets go off the rails, which they will almost surely do some time during his four-year term.\"\n\nWarsh's Wall Street and Fed credentials have earned him respect with many other leading figures in business and economics.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian said the former Wall Streeter would bring \"deep expertise\" as chair, while Alan Howard, the billionaire founder of macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, praised Warsh's \"depth of experience.\"\n\nOthers echo Zandi's emphasis on the importance of Warsh preserving the Fed's independence.\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on CNBC's 'Squawk Box' Friday that the Fed's independence is \"always something that we need to protect.\"",

    "fullText": "American Airlines has started the process of compensating flight attendants after Winter Storm Fern, as tensions flare between the union and management.\n\nOver 9,000 of its flights were canceled, marking the largest weather-related disruption in its history, the airline said. A union for flight attendants said some crew were left \"stranded in airport terminals and hotel lobbies with no accommodations.\"\n\nIn a Saturday letter to flight attendants, seen by Business Insider, the airline outlined how to make compensation claims.\n\nThe Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the union, told members on Sunday that this letter \"constitutes the company's acknowledgment that it failed to uphold the Collective Bargaining Agreement during Winter Storm Fern.\"\n\nBoth letters refer to compensation for delays in being assigned a hotel, and say that flight attendants can be reimbursed if they paid for hotel rooms or transportation.\n\nAmerican Airlines had the most cancellations of any carrier during Winter Storm Fern — in part because of disruption at its main hub, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. There were four inches of snowfall and freezing rain, per the National Weather Service. The impact was outsize because it doesn't have the same infrastructure for dealing with winter weather as airports in the northeast.\n\nAPFA's letter also referred to compensation for \"illegally rescheduling\" reserve flight attendants to work during flex days or golden days. The latter is effectively a contractually protected day off that may not be moved without mutual consent, per the APFA.\n\nAPFA referred to a part of the collective bargaining agreement that says flight attendants can be paid time and a half for the whole trip if they have to work on days off. Some crew scheduling errors could lead to 50% extra pay, it said.\n\n\"Now that the storm is largely behind us, the focus turns to holding the company accountable by ensuring management compensates Flight Attendants for the violations,\" the union told members.\n\nIt added that it expects the airline to provide \"appropriate compensation without delay.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines could not be reached for immediate comment.\n\nLast week, APFA also said that flight attendants would receive double pay for any flights last Wednesday, as American worked to get its operations back on track as the storm subsided.\n\nTensions between the union and airline management have intensified as American's profits have lagged those of competitors.\n\nAmerican last week reported a pre-tax profit of $352 million for 2025, down 80% from the year before. While United Airlines' adjusted pre-tax profit was $4.6 billion, and Delta Air Lines' $5 billion for the year.\n\nAPFA subsequently called for new leadership, citing \"a pattern of failure under the leadership of CEO Robert Isom and the American Airlines board of directors.\"\n\nDo you work for an airline?

    "fullText": "Disney's price increases are working like magic.\n\nThe Mouse House's streaming business enjoyed record profits in the quarter ending December 27, the company reported on Monday.\n\nDisney+ and Hulu generated $450 million in operating income last quarter, up 72% from a year earlier, and far above the $352 million it brought in during the prior quarter. That beat Morgan Stanley's estimate of $444 million for Disney's direct-to-consumer business.\n\nDisney's streaming revenue rose 11% to $5.3 billion last quarter. Higher subscription fees drove the lion's share of that increase, growing 13%. Streaming revenue from other sources — including advertising — ticked up by 4%. For the first time, Disney didn't share its streaming subscriber count or growth.\n\nPrice hikes are Disney's not-so-secret pixie dust, as the company has raised prices for Disney+, Hulu, or both in each of the past five years, most recently in October. The ad versions of both Disney+ and Hulu rose $2 to $11.99 a month, while the ad-free version of Disney+ jumped to $18.99, matching the cost of ad-free Hulu.\n\nIt's a similar story in Disney's experiences division: the company posted record profits last quarter after raising prices in its parks for the fourth straight year.\n\nIt's not all a fairy tale, however. Viewership growth for Disney's streaming services hasn't kept pace with its subscriber gains or price hikes. Disney's viewership share has barely grown in the US in the past four years, according to Nielsen data based on TV watch time.\n\nDisney has several ideas for improving engagement on its streaming platforms, including AI-generated content, short-form video, and a new homepage.\n\nAlthough Disney slightly beat Wall Street's overall revenue and earnings estimates, its stock slipped about 2% in premarket trading as the company disclosed some weakness in its parks business among international guests.",

    "description": "Kevin Warsh, Trump's pick for Fed chair, is a good listener who seeks consensus, former colleagues say. That could shape how he would run the Fed.",
    "fullText": "Don't expect Kevin Warsh to be a bomb-thrower.\n\nSeveral longtime observers of the Federal Reserve told Business Insider that President Donald Trump's pick to become its next chairman is a good listener who looks for consensus.\n\nThat could prove essential for Warsh, who has emerged as a sometimes-vocal critic since leaving the central bank more than a decade ago. While some Fed watchers criticized Warsh's nomination, citing shifts in his stance on interest rates, others praised his experience and communication skills.\n\nIf confirmed as its next chair, Warsh would need to steer an institution increasingly caught between public pressure and the maintenance of a somewhat frayed internal consensus.\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized Jerome Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May, for not cutting rates faster. That backdrop would likely test any incoming chair's ability to defend the central bank's independence.\n\nFormer colleagues say that Warsh understands the importance of the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. That grounding, they say, could help him manage internal debates even as external expectations shift.\n\n\"Warsh has a very valuable skillset of insider experience and outsider critique,\" said Aaron Klein, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, who worked with Warsh after 9/11, when Warsh served under President George W. Bush.\n\nWarsh proved easy to work with and adept at listening, Klein said — skills that matter when a leader must manage disagreement rather than impose direction.\n\nThe chair is only one of 12 votes on monetary policy, though that person also controls the Fed's \"incredibly powerful staff,\" he said.\n\nDonald Kohn, who spent 40 years at the central bank and worked alongside Warsh as a Fed governor, said in a statement to Business Insider that Warsh understands that the Fed's decision-making must remain focused on its dual mandate.\n\nHe has a good ability to read the room, said Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Kohn said he worked closely with Warsh during the \"stressful years\" of the 2007-09 global financial crisis.\n\nThe ability to gauge a group's temperature could be critical. Warsh would be returning to a policymaking environment — and to staff and officials — he has publicly criticized in recent years.\n\nCongress set up the Fed so that it would be shielded from political pressure to juice the economy by slashing rates — and risk subsequent inflation.\n\n\"He knows he will need to use his considerable skills to marshal evidence and analysis to support the direction he wants to take policy,\" Kohn said.\n\nThat matters in part because the bank's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets short-term rates, is divided; it hasn't voted unanimously since July. The committee was again split at its January meeting, when 10 members, including Powell, voted to hold on rates, while two sought a cut.\n\nIn recent years, Warsh has sharpened his critiques of the Fed, including in speeches and in his academic work at Stanford. In a 2023 op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he called for \"regime change\" in US economic policy. Warsh criticized the Fed for being too slow to corral inflation after policymakers slashed borrowing costs in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nKlein, who was a lead Democratic staffer on Warsh's original Senate confirmation in 2006, said that Warsh's critiques from academia have been \"reasonable and thoughtful.\"\n\nKlein added that Warsh's experience makes him an ideal operator to make changes at the central bank if he's once again confirmed by the Senate.\n\n\"I hope he shakes up the Fed's decision-making process, which has gotten most of the major bank regulatory questions dead wrong over the last 30 years, while maintaining the Fed's independence on monetary policy,\" Klein said.\n\nA Fed spokesperson declined to comment on the critique.\n\nNot everyone sees Warsh as a change agent, despite his criticisms. There is a risk that his instinct to seek common ground could become a limitation, Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist at RSM US, told Business Insider.\n\n\"He's consensus-oriented and not willing to jump too far out in front of the committee,\" Brusuelas said.\n\nIn reading policymaking transcripts from Warsh's time at the Fed, from 2006 to 2011, he came off as a follower rather than a leader, Brusuelas said.\n\n\"He's an echo, not the tip of the spear,\" he said.\n\nA leadership style that's focused on common consent and \"organized around protecting the status quo\" means that Warsh will likely \"always be late\" to needed policy shifts due to domestic or external shocks, Brusuelas said.\n\nWarsh didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nAsked about the criticism, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement that to restore confidence at the Fed, the president's primary considerations for a new chairman were \"competence and experience.\"\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is eminently qualified to hold the job,\" Desai said.\n\nFamed economist Mohamed El-Erian likewise sees Warsh as a good fit, writing on X that Warsh \"brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills.\"",

    "title": "I ate unlimited pizza for $29 at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant at a luxury Dubai hotel. I tapped out at 5 slices, but it was worth it.",
    "description": "Located inside Atlantis, The Palm, Gordon Ramsay's Street Pizza is a casual, all-you-can-eat pizza spot.",
    "fullText": "Gordon Ramsay is best known for high-end restaurants and high-pressure kitchens. But inside one of Dubai's most expensive hotels — home to fine-dining establishments like Nobu, Ossiano, and Hakkasan — sits one of his most affordable restaurant concepts: Street Pizza.\n\nLocated inside Atlantis, The Palm, Street Pizza is a casual, all-you-can-eat pizza spot that feels almost out of place in a resort built around tasting menus and special-occasion dining.\n\nThat contrast, though, makes sense in the context of Dubai's booming food scene.\n\nAccording to the Dubai Gastronomy Industry Report published by the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, the city's food-and-beverage sector has become a major economic driver, helping attract nearly 19 million international visitors in 2024 — up about 9% from the year before — and fueling constant innovation across both casual and upscale dining.\n\nIt also reflects a broader shift in Ramsay's business.\n\nIn recent years, Ramsay has leaned into more casual, high-volume concepts alongside his fine-dining restaurants, launching Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips, Street Burger, and Street Pizza.\n\nStreet Pizza has outposts in cities like Washington, DC — where it operates more like an à la carte pizzeria rather than a bottomless concept — as well as in Doha and Kuala Lumpur. This month, the restaurant opened doors inside Mumbai's international airport, underscoring how these formats are designed for high-traffic, tourist-heavy settings.\n\nIn Dubai, the concept is designed around value. Guests pay 105 United Arab Emirates dirham (AED), or about $29, for unlimited pizza from a fixed menu, with free-flowing soft beverages available for an additional AED 35, or about $10, an unusual offering for a luxury resort.\n\nAnyone can dine at the location in Atlantis, The Palm — you don't need to be a guest of the hotel. So I visited the restaurant on a busy Sunday evening to see how the concept holds up and whether unlimited pizza actually works inside one of Dubai's most luxurious hotels.\n\nThe restaurant, which opened in 2021, sits close to the entrance of Aquaventure, a water park connected to the hotel. When I arrived around 5:30 p.m., it was about half full, with kids in swimsuits and flip-flops filtering in alongside parents still carrying towels.\n\nA gelato and soft-serve counter at the front makes it an easy stop for families and groups looking for a quick bite after a long day out in the sun.\n\nBright neon signs, graffiti-style artwork, and hanging lights gave the restaurant an energetic, almost food-hall feel, a sharp contrast to the polished dining rooms of Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen next door.\n\nThe restaurant space is split between two concepts, with Street Pizza on one side and Bread Street Kitchen on the other. Street Pizza's dining area features a mix of booths and high tables, many of which overlook its more refined neighbor.\n\nScattered around the room, I saw subtle nods to Ramsay's British roots, including soft-serve machines draped in a UK flag and a red telephone booth.\n\nThe kitchen is fully open, with staff rolling dough, grating cheese, adding toppings, and sliding pizzas in and out of the oven in full view.\n\nTwo to three staff members rotated constantly between stations, moving slices quickly. When we arrived, the trays at the front were briefly empty — it seemed that diners were grabbing slices as soon as they were rolled out.\n\nAlongside pizzas, the menu listed salads, wings, and a full drinks section with cocktails and mocktails. I brought my husband along to help me try out the restaurant, and we decided to stick to pizza this time.\n\nOnce we were seated, our server explained he would come around with different pies every few minutes, offering slices fresh out of the oven.\n\nAnd with that, our bottomless pizza experience officially began.\n\nThe first slice I tried was the Cinque Formaggi, made with mozzarella, Taleggio, provolone, Gorgonzola, and Parmesan, layered over a roast-onion cream base and finished with chives.\n\nIt arrived piping hot, with a thin, airy crust that bent slightly when lifted. I added some chili flakes to give the creamy slice a hint of heat. The result was a well-balanced, cheesy slice that did not feel too heavy.\n\nIt was easily one of my favorite slices of the night — and the only one I had twice.\n\nThis turned out to be my second-favorite slice.\n\nMade with tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil, it was a classic done well.\n\nI usually find that sauce can overpower a Margherita pizza, but this one felt balanced — it was slightly acidic with a touch of sweetness. Our server told us the sauce is made in-house daily using tomatoes imported from Italy.\n\nThe mozzarella was creamy without feeling heavy, and the basil added a clean, fresh note.\n\nOur server explained that Street Pizza offers a daily special pie that changes based on ingredient availability and quantity. You have to ask what it is, as it isn't listed on the menu.\n\nThat day's special was mambo chicken pizza, topped with grilled chicken, onions, cilantro, spring onions, cheese, and a bright-orange mambo sauce.\n\nMambo sauce, which is sweet and tangy, is a popular condiment in the Washington, DC, area, where it's often served alongside fried chicken.\n\nWhile I liked the idea, the sauce was too sweet for my taste. I'm not a fan of pairing chicken with sweet sauces, and this slice didn't quite work for me.\n\nMy husband, however, enjoyed the creativity and noted that it felt like a pizza he wouldn't easily find on another menu.\n\nI wouldn't usually order this combination of toppings. I love butter garlic prawns, but shrimp on pizza isn't something I'd ever imagined enjoying.\n\nThis slice surprised me in a good way. The garlic-heavy base worked well with the prawns, and I particularly enjoyed the crispy Parmesan and pangrattato, which added crunch to each bite.\n\nThat said, I wish the prawns had a bit more char. A deeper grill on the shrimp would have added extra depth and taken the pizza up a notch.\n\nAcross the table, I spotted a pizza leaderboard tracking the highest slice counts. Our server told us the record — 41 slices — was set by a teenager about seven months ago, and that another recent attempt stopped at 40 after the diner felt dizzy.\n\nAnyone who breaks the record gets a free meal, which adds a fun, competitive twist to an otherwise regular meal.\n\nAs for me, I knew pretty quickly I wasn't a contender. I tapped out at five slices, which suddenly felt very reasonable once I'd seen the numbers on the wall.",

    "description": "Under Josh D'Amaro, Disney's experiences business has carried the company's profits. It shows why he's considered a top CEO contender.",
    "fullText": "Josh D'Amaro appears to be the frontrunner in the race to be Disney's next CEO, and the Mouse House's latest quarterly earnings showed why.\n\nDisney's experiences business, which D'Amaro oversees, is the backbone of a company that's being weighed down by the struggling pay-TV business and isn't yet lifted up by its streaming profits. And when that part of the business sneezes, the stock catches a cold.\n\nAlthough the unit generated record profits, and Disney overall slightly beat Wall Street estimates on both revenue and earnings, the stock fell about 5% in early trading.\n\nInvestors seemed worried about Disney's reference to \"international visitation headwinds\" at its US parks. Other possible factors driving down the stock were Disney's year-over-year decline in earnings per share and its lukewarm second-quarter guidance.\n\nBoth the record experiences profits and the investor concerns underscore just how important D'Amaro and his fiefdom are to the company.\n\nBloomberg reported on Monday that Disney's board of directors \"is aligning on promoting\" D'Amaro to replace longtime CEO Bob Iger, who's planning to retire later this year. Business Insider could not independently confirm the reporting. Disney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nUsers on the prediction market Kalshi assigned Josh D'Amaro a 92% chance of becoming the next CEO as of Monday morning.\n\nDana Walden, who runs Disney's entertainment and TV businesses, is widely seen to be the other top contender for the coveted CEO job. Walden has grown the streaming unit, which also turned in record profits in the last quarter. It's crucial to Disney's future, since traditional TV networks are losing their value due to continued cord-cutting.\n\nStill, D'Amaro's division is the profit-generating machine. Disney's parks, cruises, and products accounted for more than 70% of its operating income, despite making up a relatively small slice of its revenue at under 39%. Jason Bazinet, a media analyst at Citi, said Monday on CNBC that almost all of Disney's earnings underperformance last quarter came from the entertainment segment.\n\nBazinet added that \"virtually everyone\" on the buy side that he's spoken to \"would prefer that Mr. D'Amaro is named the new CEO.\"\n\n\"Nothing against Ms. Walden, but people just like Mr. D'Amaro a bit more,\" he said.\n\nD'Amaro's experiences segment has pulled off an impressive feat: consistently reeling in record revenue and hefty profits by making more money from each visitor, without alienating its biggest fans. The Mouse House has raised ticket prices for its US parks in each of the past four years.\n\nDisney said per-person spending at its US parks rose 4% last quarter, though attendance only increased by 1%, due in part to a dip in visits from international guests. That means the company is making more per customer, in part by upselling through Lightning Lane fast passes. While Disney could risk losing lower-income or middle-class visitors if it keeps hiking prices, its results suggest that's not an issue yet.\n\nOn Disney's earnings call, one analyst remarked on how the parks business had gone from the worst part of the company's portfolio to its profit engine.\n\nIger responded that he's \"very, very bullish\" on the parks business, which has \"never been more broad or more diverse.\"\n\n\"We have a healthy competition now at our company, in terms of which of those two businesses is going to essentially prevail as the No. 1 driver of profitability for the company,\" Iger said, in reference to the experiences and entertainment businesses — though he could also have been slyly nodding at the race between Walden and D'Amaro.",

    "description": "The Meteor is a powerful weapon that Ukraine says would give it a fighting chance against the aircraft carrying highly destructive glide bombs.",
    "fullText": "A future Ukrainian fleet of Gripen fighter jets could be armed with Europe's best air-to-air missile, giving Kyiv a powerful new weapon to strike Russian aircraft from a distance.\n\nMykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's defense minister, and his Swedish counterpart discussed the possibility of Stockholm sending JAS 39 Gripen jets and Meteor missiles to Kyiv in a call on Sunday.\n\nThese long-range air-to-air missiles \"are key tools for countering aircraft carriers of guided aerial bombs,\" the Ukrainian defense ministry said in a readout of the call. The Russian bombs are problematic for Kyiv because they can be launched from standoff ranges and are very difficult to intercept.\n\nThe Meteor is a beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile developed by the European multinational defense corporation MBDA and is widely considered the best such weapon made on the continent.\n\nThe 12-foot-long Meteor weighs more than 400 pounds and is fired from a number of fighter jets, including the Swedish Gripen, the French Rafale, and the European Eurofighter Typhoon. It can travel more than 75 miles and exceed Mach 4 (3,000 miles per hour).\n\nGuided by an active radar seeker, the Meteor uses an air-breathing jet engine to stay fast all the way to the intercept, giving it what MBDA says is the largest \"no-escape zone\" of any air-to-air missile. Unlike many long-range missiles that lose speed late in flight, Meteor retains its energy, making it far harder for a target aircraft to evade.\n\nSweden, one of only a handful of countries that has armed its fighter jets with the Meteor, was the first to put the missile into service in 2016.\n\nThe discussions on the Meteor come more than three months after Ukraine and Sweden signed a letter of intent to export up to 150 Gripen fighter jets to Kyiv.\n\nThe deal is not yet finalized. However, the potential arms acquisition would significantly help modernize Ukraine's air force, which mostly consists of aging Soviet-era fighters, as well as a small batch of American F-16s and French Mirage 2000s.\n\nThe Gripen, manufactured by Swedish aerospace and defense giant Saab, is considered by airpower experts to be the ideal Western fighter jet for Ukraine because it is designed to operate from austere airstrips and requires minimal maintenance, better supporting dispersed operations than some other airframes.\n\nWhile no decision appears to have been made regarding the Meteor missile, recent discussions between Fedorov and his counterpart, Pål Jonson, suggest the transfer could be included in future weapons packages.\n\nUkraine's defense ministry said in the call readout on Sunday that Sweden is preparing a \"large-scale\" aid package for Ukraine that is set to include air defense systems, radars, electronic warfare systems, and drones.",

    "fullText": "Celebrations didn't stop after the 2026 Grammys concluded on Sunday night.\n\nFollowing the awards ceremony inside the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, stars like Justin Bieber, Teyana Taylor, Tate McRae, and more headed to glamorous after-parties.\n\nWhile some of them remained in their stunning red-carpet looks, others changed into statement outfits on the way there.\n\nHere's what they wore, from a leather dress and a see-through trench coat to a casual hoodie.\n\nBieber was spotted outside the W Magazine party with his friend and fellow artist Billie Eilish.\n\nHe ditched the oversize Balenciaga suit he wore at the Grammys, though. For the second half of the evening, he wore blue jeans with a teal zip-up hoodie. He seemed to have ditched the shirt underneath.\n\nEilish, who took home the song of the year Grammy for \"Wildflower,\" removed a few outer pieces of her Hodakova ensemble after the awards ceremony. What remained was her black skirt, leather belt, and oversize jacket.\n\nShe spent time with Rosé, who was nominated for three Grammys this year, at the W Magazine party. The \"APT.\" musician had changed into a sparkling, strapless dress with a bow on its neckline.\n\nWhen she arrived at the W Magazine party, Stewart was wearing dark satin pants with a chocolate-brown sweater embellished with feathers.\n\nThe look was cozy and elevated by her pointed gold heels.\n\nShe wore a long-sleeved, floor-length dress for the W Magazine event. The dress was form-fitting, covered in sparkles, and featured a matching scarf around her neck, which added to its drama.\n\nShe also wore sunglasses and carried a heart-shaped mirror bedazzled with jewels.\n\nShe was photographed at the W Magazine party wearing a sleeveless, figure-hugging gown.\n\nIt had a structured bodice of black lace and a silky, floor-length skirt that wrapped into a knot around her waist.\n\nLovato let the dress do all the talking, adding no accessories.\n\nThe \"Sports Car\" singer was photographed wearing black latex at the W Magazine party.\n\nHer sleeveless dress hugged her body, reached her ankles, and had a deep sweetheart neckline. She wore it sans accessories and styled her hair in loose waves.\n\nMcRae was nominated for her first Grammy this year in the best dance pop recording category.\n\nThe \"KPop Demon Hunters\" group won their first Grammy — the best song written for visual media award — on Sunday night.\n\nThey also hit the W Magazine after-party, where each member wore a unique outfit that reflected their individual style.\n\nAudrey Nuna donned a puffy gray suit, Ejae wore a seafoam-green gown covered in sequins, and Rei Ami sported a corseted red-and-lilac gown.\n\nBalvin, who was nominated for the best música urbana album Grammy this year, attended Universal Music Group's after-party in a classic black tuxedo.\n\nOne standout accessory, though, made all the difference. Atop his tie, the musician wore a necklace that appeared to be crafted from diamonds and various gemstones.\n\nThe \"Heated Rivalry\" stars weren't at the Grammy Awards, but they did stop by the star-studded after-party.\n\nFrançois Arnaud did so in black trousers, a see-through blouse, and a leather jacket, while Connor Storrie stood beside him in a gray plaid suit and a mustard-yellow tank top.\n\nThe best new artist nominee arrived at the W Magazine party in a leather suit that comprised skinny trousers and a cropped jacket. The latter had crystal buttons and a unique wave shape.\n\nBeneath his jacket, Sombr wore a lace shirt with long sleeves and a high neckline. It was the perfect outfit to complement the sparkling Valentino suit he wore earlier in the evening.",

    "description": "Registration paperwork and job listings show connections between billionaire Thomas Peterffy's Interactive Brokers and a new prediction market.",
    "fullText": "A new prediction markets startup with strong ties to billionaire Thomas Peterffy is hiring staff and preparing to launch, job postings and corporate filings reviewed by Business Inside show.\n\nLumina Markets began advertising last week for roles in marketing and legal. Job listings say it's \"backed by a billionaire pioneer of electronic trading,\" and note that it's preparing to launch a new prediction markets platform. The jobs were posted on LinkedIn by an employee at Interactive Brokers, the trading giant founded by Peterffy.\n\nRegistration documents show that Lumina was incorporated by an in-house lawyer at Interactive Brokers; they list its CEO as another attorney who has worked with Interactive Brokers and Peterffy.\n\nLumina would enter the white-hot world of prediction markets, where traders are wagering over $4 billion a week on the outcome of current events, according to data published by the platforms, with bets being placed on everything from the weather to who wins the Super Bowl.\n\nKalshi, the US-based prediction market, has a valuation of $11 billion, while Polymarket was valued at roughly $9 billion during an October fundraise. Analysts at Citizens estimated the industry as a whole is bringing in roughly $2 billion a year in revenue, Bloomberg reported in December, with that amount expected to grow to as much as $10 billion over the next five years.\n\nIt's not clear how Lumina will be different from ForecastEx, an exchange regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission owned by Interactive Brokers. ForecastEx, whose contracts are offered on Interactive Brokers' own website as well as Robinhood, experienced a surge of interest around the 2024 election, but now amounts to less than 1% of the Kalshi's trading volume, according to data published by the platforms. Other prediction markets platforms available in the US include offerings from crypto trading platforms and operators of state-regulated sportsbooks.\n\nThe marketing job description says Lumina will be hiring someone responsible for user acquisition, including hiring influencers; managing social media channels, newsletters, and community spaces; and analytics. It says the company will have a \"minimalist identity that simplifies and builds trust in prediction markets.\"\n\n\"Lumina is approaching this opportunity with a long-term mindset and institutional standards,\" the listings say. \"Our mission is to make prediction markets mainstream. What others view as niche speculation, we see as a trillion-dollar opportunity to redefine everyday investments.\"\n\nThe ad for the in-house lawyer position seeks candidates who have \"experience at or with an introducing broker, FCM, exchange, or fintech brokerage.\" Brokers and FCMs, or futures commission merchants, allow people to trade on exchanges like ForecastEx or Kalshi.\n\nLumina's website features a sleek logo, the words \"Future, priced,\" and little else.\n\nThe people listed on its paperwork and job listings didn't reply to inquiries from Business Insider. Representatives for Interactive Brokers and Lumina Markets didn't reply to emails and messages. A person to whom an inquiry for Peterffy was directed did not immediately comment.\n\nInteractive Brokers is known for its low fees.

    "title": "Speculation and a squeeze: A timeline of the roller coaster ride in gold and silver that ended in a crash",
    "description": "The speculative mania in metal markets, particularly silver, had set the stage for Friday's stunning declines.",
    "fullText": "The violent drop in silver and gold prices felt like a sudden end to a yearlong party in metal markets, but a cocktail of forces had set the stage for a burst of volatility.\n\nAssessing the carnage in the days after Friday's crash, analysts say the pieces were in place for a correction, thanks to the speculative mania that gripped metals in recent months, particularly silver, and a reassessment of one of the primary forces behind the stunning rally in metals since early 2025.\n\nThe abrupt bust after the dizzying boom was the worst sell-off in gold since 2013 and the deepest one-day plunge in silver since 1980. Both gold and silver remained volatile on Monday, flitting between slight gains and losses throughout the day.\n\nHere's the timeline of how metals took off — and why the trade suddenly went up in flames.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shocked markets last year by following through with his threats to levy tariffs on the US's top trading partners, causing US assets to plunge.\n\nThe tariffs, in particular, sparked the \"Sell America\" trade, a movement in which investors dump US-based assets out of fear for the economic and inflation outlook.\n\nOn the flip side of the same coin is the debasement trade, which has investors flocking to assets perceived as protected against a devaluation of the US currency and the erosion of trust in the US amid fights over Fed independence.\n\nBoth forces turned into huge tailwinds for gold and silver in 2025. Gold prices rose 14% from their April low to the start of August. Silver prices surged 26% over the same timeframe.\n\nJeffrey Christian, a longtime commodities analyst, said he believed speculation in gold and silver began to enter the picture early last fall. He pointed to the sharp increase in gold and silver prices following the Fed's Jackson Hole Symposium, when the central bank signaled it would cut interest rates more aggressively than markets had expected.\n\nMetals surged as concerns grew over the outlook for inflation — particularly as Trump continued his pressure campaign to get the Fed to cut interest rates over the summer. Gold prices surged around 12% in the month following the start of Jackson Hole, while silver climbed 14%.\n\nThat rally was the prime opportunity for momentum traders, who enter trades as prices begin to pick up steam, Christian told Business Insider.\n\nThe speculative trade fueling gold and silver also caught the attention of investors in China, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\n\"In China, trading and speculation has been part of the culture, similar to how it is in America,\" Torres said, pointing to other areas of the Chinese market that are frequent sources of speculation, like real estate. He also noted that many investors in the nation appeared to be interested in the \"Sell America\" movement.\n\n\"China was certainly a big piece of that,\" Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told BI.\n\nIn December, the CME Group and the Shanghai Gold Exchange said they would raise cash requirements to hold positions in precious metals, one factor that increased selling pressure. After the CME's announcement, gold prices dipped, and silver dropped 5%.\n\nMomentum traders frequently use leverage to juice returns on their positions, which can increase losses if an investment starts to plunge and create a negative \"self-fulfilling\" prophecy in the asset's price, Hogan said.\n\n\"It increases your returns on the way up, but it doubles your losses on the way down,\" he added of the effect of leveraged positions on asset prices.\n\nRising geopolitical tensions sent gold and silver sprinting to new highs. In the first 29 days of the year, gold rallied 23%, fueled in large part by concerns about the US raid on Venezuela, escalating tensions with Iran, and Trump's aggressive rhetoric about taking over Greenland.\n\nSilver prices soared 62% over the same timeframe.\n\nMeanwhile, selling pressure for metals investors continued to build up. For instance, rising volatility and the approach of Lunar New Year in China are factors that typically cause investors to pull back their positions, commodities strategists at ING wrote on Monday.\n\nA day after silver touched an all-time high, Kevin Warsh's nomination to lead the Fed set the stunning decline in motion.\n\nTrump's pick prompted an abrupt rethink of the force that had helped propel precious metals to record highs over the last 12 months. Suddenly, the dollar rose, gold and silver plummeted, and the debasement trade was on shaky ground.\n\nTo investors, the logic is that Warsh, who has held a more hawkish stance on inflation, is causing rates expectations to rise. That caused the US dollar to strengthen on Friday, which makes safe-havens like gold and silver look less attractive by comparison.\n\n\"The nomination of Kevin Warsh as Fed chair broke the bearish sentiment on the USD and likely became the catalyst for the excessive moves in Gold and Silver, combined with excessive price technicals,\" Manish Kabra, the head of US equity strategy at Societe Generale, said on Monday.\n\nHogan said he believed the momentum traders were now being \"flushed out\" of the market, largely due to struggles with leverage. He said he believed Warsh's nomination was one factor that could have helped trigger the sell-off.\n\n\"I don't know that he was necessarily the straw that broke the camel's back on this,\" he said, pointing to the double-digit increases in gold and silver in recent months. \"We had an asset class that went parabolic over the course of the last several months, and those things tend to resolve themselves. And once they start to, there's as much momentum on the downside as there is on the upside.\"\n\n\"This is the way markets behave, and no one should be surprised that speculators have poured into a market that's moving parabolic, and no one should be surprised when they leave,\" CPM's Jeffrey Christian told Business Insider in a recent interview.",

Schonfeld also returned 1% in its flagship Partners fund last month, a person close to the firm said. Michael Gelband's ExodusPoint, which had the best year in its history in 2025, was up 1.8% in January, a person close to the manager said.\n\nMultistrategy funds place bets across a diversified set of strategies to generate strong returns for investors. However, a trend started in 2025 seems to be continuing for some bit names: several firms' smaller funds outperformed their broader flagship offerings.\n\nCitadel's Tactical Trading fund, which blends its fundamental stockpicking strategies with its computer-run ones, was up 2% in January, a strong showing given the choppy start to the year quant funds have faced. The firm's fixed-income-only fund was up 1.3%, the person close to the manager said.\n\nSchonfeld's Fundamental Equity fund was up 2.4% in January, and LMR's convertibles-focused fund posted a 2.5% gain last month, people close to the two managers told Business Insider.\n\nThe S&P 500 index was up 1.4% last month, hitting all-time highs in the middle of January, before dipping slightly before the month's end.\n\nA bright spot in the industry was strategies focused on Asian markets. Two Asia-based multistrategy managers, $5 billion Dymon Asia and $3 billion Pinpoint Asset Management, had banner months, returning 5% and 4.8%, respectively.\n\nFor Pinpoint, it was the best monthly return since July 2020, a person close to the manager told Business Insider. Dymon Asia's returns were driven by Asian equities and FX strategies, a senior executive at the firm told Business Insider.\n\nThe firms mentioned declined to comment. \n\n(Editor's note: This story was originally published on February 2 at 12:33 p.m. New figures have been added to the table below as they have been learned.)",

    "description": "Gold and silver crashed on Friday, but analysts caution that the dramatic declines might not be a moment to buy the dip in the precious metals.",
    "fullText": "Gold and silver prices ended last week deep in the red as a historic sell-off swept the market on Friday, and market experts say the plunge isn't necessarily a moment to buy the dip.\n\nThe reaction to President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve sparked chaos, with silver down more than 30% and gold falling more than 10%. Metal markets remained volatile as traders returned from the weekend on Monday.\n\nWhile a 36% drop in the price of any asset might seem like an opportunity to buy, analysts and commentators urged caution ahead of what's likely to be a volatile stretch.\n\nKatie Stockton, a technical analyst and managing partner of market research firm Fairlead Strategies, told CNBC that she thinks gold and silver prices are in eight or nine more weeks of \"corrective action,\" adding that AI stocks could experience similar volatility.\n\nOther finance pros are more bearish on the continued strength of the debasement trade, which has been one of the chief forces driving precious metals higher since early 2025. José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, thinks both gold and silver are vulnerable to a larger pullback as they have run ahead of their fundamentals.\n\n\"The red hot appreciation has become more speculative in nature and prices have climbed especially fast without much justification, potentially setting up the stage for a painful disappointment for those that bought at the tops,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nMark Malek, chief investment officer of Siebert Financial, echoed Torres' bearish sentiment.\n\n\"Silver will exaggerate whatever gold does next,\" he said. \"It always runs hotter on the way up and bleeds faster on the way down. This isn't the start or the end of gold's story—it's the dangerous middle.\"\n\nNancy Tengler, CEO and CIO at Laffer Tengler Investments, thinks the strategic play right now is for investors to consider stocks over gold.\n\n\"I would stay away from gold now that it's turned into a momentum trade, especially when few people can clearly explain why it's risen so much,\" she noted. \"I'd step aside, wait for things to settle, and then re-enter if you still want exposure. These large swings in so-called safe-haven investments are a bit concerning.\"\n\nMarcus Sturdivant Sr, managing principal at investment advisory firm The ABC Squared, told Business Insider that, based on fundamental analysis, gold and silver should solidify and resume their positions as popular safe-haven assets soon. However, he acknowledged that the unpredictable nature of President Trump's economic policy makes it hard to predict their direction in the near term. \n\n\"Was the selloff overdone? Yes, but we could see precious metals slip a bit more,\" he stated. \"Gold's run was pushed by central banks across the globe during last year's economic detox. Metals have been dead money for a decade before 25.",

    "title": "I ate almost every frozen appetizer I could find at Costco. Here's what is and isn't worth buying for a party (or lunch).",
    "description": "While searching for the best frozen appetizers at Costco, I tried wings I wouldn't recommend and Kirkland Signature shrimp I'd serve at a party.",
    "fullText": "It's no secret that Costco is a great place to stock up before a party — just check out the lines at your local store in the days leading up to any major holiday.\n\nFor me, nothing's more important than the menu when I'm hosting a get-together, and I know that picking up a premade appetizer (or three) at Costco can save a lot of time and energy.\n\nHowever, frozen food at the retailer tends to come in large packages, and I'm not eager to waste precious freezer space on appetizers my guests won't enjoy.\n\nWith the Super Bowl right around the corner and football fans everywhere plotting their menus, I bought 12 different appetizers from Costco's freezer section and taste-tested them with my family of four to figure out which ones are worth serving.\n\nHere's my ranking, from last place to my top pick.\n\nI paid about $15 for a 3-pound package of 30 chicken-and-cheese taquitos, making these a fairly inexpensive offering on this list.\n\nAlthough I didn't dislike any of the appetizers I tried, I was somewhat surprised to learn that the El Monterey taquitos turned out to be the least compelling of the bunch — especially because I've had them before without complaints.\n\nThey were ready after about 10 minutes in the air fryer, though they cooked a little unevenly — the outer edges of the taquitos were much crispier than their middles.\n\nThe filling was pleasantly cheesy but not especially flavorful, with just a light hint of taco seasoning and sparse, small chunks of chicken. I served them with a Sriracha crema sauce, which was delicious, and they're an effective delivery method for a good sauce.\n\nI'll probably skip them next time in favor of similar, better options I found, but I'd still eat them if someone served them at a party I attended.\n\nFor a Super Bowl party, or any other gathering tied to a large sporting event, wings feel like a must.\n\nAlthough it's fairly easy to make Buffalo-style wings from scratch in an air fryer, a frozen option is far more convenient because it means you're not dealing with raw chicken while you're busy pulling your party together.\n\nSo I thought the Foster Farms take-out crispy wings, at $19 for a 4-pound bag, might make a solid alternative to my own homemade wings.\n\nThe best wings have a crunch, so I followed the \"extra crispy\" cooking instructions on the package. Although I air-fried these for more than 20 minutes, the skin never really got crispy.\n\nThese came with a Buffalo sauce that was decent, with a nice vinegary bite, and the meat stayed fairly moist even after the extra cooking time.\n\nHowever, I'd be disappointed if these were the wings served at a Super Bowl party, so I wouldn't serve them myself.\n\nThere was a wide variety of dumpling options to choose from at my local Costco.\n\nLooking for something classic, I settled on the Ajinomoto Japanese-style gyoza, which cost me $15 for a package of 60 dumplings. These are hane-style gyoza, known for the crisp lace that forms on the bottoms of the dumplings when they cook.\n\nThe box conveniently included five trays of 12 gyoza, making it easy to cook these in smaller batches if needed.\n\nThe Tyson Thai-style chili crispy wings, which cost $18 for a 3-½ -pound bag, seemed intriguing as an alternative or complement to the traditional Buffalo variety.\n\nThese are dry-rubbed wings, so they didn't involve the additional hassle of tossing them in sauce after they cooked.\n\nAs with the Foster Farms wings, I followed the \"extra crispy\" instructions for preparing these. Fortunately, these wings did develop a pleasantly crispy skin.\n\nThey had a decent, peppery kick of spice and some vague sweetness, but no identifiable flavor that I would associate with Thai food. I would've preferred a much stronger seasoning.\n\nI could imagine serving these at a gathering, but definitely not as the wings at a football-centric party.\n\nMy kids love mozzarella sticks, so I always keep some in the freezer for emergencies. Most often, it's the 5-pound bag from Petite Cuisine.\n\nI got it on sale for $13.50 (3.50 off) on the day of my most recent Costco visit.\n\nThe mozzarella sticks were ready after only four minutes in the air fryer, and I know from experience that it's important to be vigilant — if they get too hot, the cheese will explode out of the breading and make a mess.\n\nThese are delightfully crispy on the outside with a nice garlic flavor in the breadcrumbs, and the cheese inside turns deliciously molten when it's hot.\n\nDisappointingly, I was fresh out of marinara at the time of our taste-test, but I know these salty mozzarella sticks are nicely complemented by a sweet sauce for dipping.\n\nThe only real drawback to these is the amount of freezer space the massive 5-pound bag occupies.\n\nIn my book, a pizza counts as an appetizer if you cut it into small pieces and call it \"flatbread.\"\n\nI generally do not like cauliflower and had never tried a cauliflower-crust pizza before, but I was still curious to try the loaded Kirkland Signature pies.\n\nThey weren't very expensive, and the photo on the box seemed appealing. I paid $12 for a pack of two.\n\nEach pie featured a nice, colorful array of toppings — heavy on peppers, pepperoni, and sausage — and only took about 20 minutes to bake in my oven.\n\nThe cracker-thin, crispy crust was the best part. It had no noticeable cauliflower flavor, and I preferred its texture to that of the gluten-free pizza from my local pizzeria.\n\nNone of the toppings were especially flavorful, but the sweetness of the peppers and tomato sauce, combined with the saltiness of the cheese, pepperoni, and sausage, made for a satisfying bite.\n\nThis would be a nice option for any get-together, especially if some guests are gluten-intolerant.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, pigs-in-blankets are the standard-bearer for hors d'oeuvres.\n\nThey're not hard to make on your own with cocktail franks and premade dough, but buying already constructed pigs-in-blankets means one less thing to think about on the day of a party.\n\nThese were the most expensive appetizers I tried at $22, though the hefty package did come with 2 ½-pounds of pigs in a blanket.\n\nAfter about 15 minutes in the air fryer, the pastry shells were an appealing golden brown, and the cocktail franks were sizzling hot.\n\nThe franks themselves are just OK, but the pastry crust comes out brilliantly flaky and tasty — these are just a perfect finger food.\n\nI've served these to guests before, and I'd definitely do so again.\n\nWe hadn't tried these yet because I'd been intimidated by the bag's massive size, and my 5-year-old daughter — our family's primary consumer of chicken nuggets — has very particular taste in chicken nuggets.\n\nHowever, they're a mainstay of the Costco freezer section and a must-buy for a lot of families.\n\nSo, for this taste test, I paid $15 for the 4-pound bag of Kirkland Signature lightly breaded chicken-breast chunks.\n\nChicken nuggets — or chicken-breast chunks — are consistently easy to air-fry, and these crisped up and took on a nice golden hue after about 10 minutes of cook time.\n\nThe meat inside stayed moist, and the breading had a slightly peppery kick, which made these too \"spicy\" for my daughter's tastes, but great for mine.\n\nI liked them enough on their own with some honey mustard, but I also plan to try tossing them with sauce to serve as \"boneless wings.\"\n\nAt $16 for a package of 12 buns, these Laoban Chinese-style barbecue pork bao buns felt a bit pricey — especially by Costco standards.\n\nHowever, I typically enjoy a good barbecue pork bao bun, and I'd never had one at home before, so I gave them a shot.\n\nThe buns come individually wrapped in microwavable bags, but I didn't like their texture as much out of the microwave as I did after steaming them for 10 minutes.\n\nThe moist, sweet, squishy bun made for a nice change of pace among so many salty and crunchy appetizer options. The Berkshire pork filling was earthy and sweet with a hint of five-spice seasoning, and moist without seeming goopy.\n\nMy only hesitation in serving them would be that they're a little big for a typical party appetizer, but I probably won't let that hold me back.\n\nMy family loves soup dumplings, but we're particular about them. I've never before found a frozen option that comes close to the ones at our nearby takeout spot.\n\nThe Mila pork soup dumplings are the type of thing I normally don't take chances on at Costco — I don't want to risk committing that much freezer space to something we're not actually going to enjoy.\n\nHowever, I took the plunge for the taste test and spent $13 on the 44-ounce bag.\n\nI was worried when I pulled the dumplings from the bag and found they'd frozen together into a giant mound, since any in the delicate dough would mean all the soup would spill out during prep.\n\nBut after I let them thaw for a few minutes, I was able to carefully pull individual dumplings apart and steam them using the included steamer liners.\n\nThey came out perfectly soft, moist, and intact, as though I'd gotten takeout. And the flavor, while mild, was tasty and comforting.\n\nThese dumplings would be a great way to welcome guests in from the cold, and I'll be repurchasing them now that I know everyone in my family approves.\n\nAt Costco, I also picked up a box of Cuisine Adventures Firecrackers filled with white-mean chicken, green chiles, and cheese.\n\nBased on the description, they seemed similar to the taquitos I tried — chicken and cheese inside a crispy wrapper.\n\nThe 30-ounce package, which contains 30 pieces, was on sale for $9.50 ($3.50 off) and looked promising.\n\nAfter 10 minutes in the air fryer, it became clear that the Firecracker wrapper is more like an egg roll than a tortilla — it crisped up far more evenly than the taquitos.\n\nThe filling was delicious, with distinct chunks of chicken and green chile, plus yellow kernels of corn that add a nice pop of sweet flavor.\n\nThese taste like something you might see sold as \"southwestern egg rolls\" in a restaurant, and I've definitely had southwestern egg rolls in restaurants that weren't as good as these.\n\nI served these with the same Sriracha crema I used for the taquitos, and again, it made for a nice addition, but I can imagine a broad range of sauces pairing well with these.\n\nThese shrimp looked golden and ready after 10 minutes in the air fryer. The panko breading was crunchy with a tasty hint of garlicky seasoning, and the shrimp inside was perfectly tender.\n\nThey were delicious on their own and a hit with my family, but I could imagine pairing them with a marinara or cocktail sauce for dipping.\n\nThe tails make a great little handle when these shrimp are served as finger food, but I also plan to slice a few tails off these to use them in sandwiches.\n\nI will absolutely serve this Kirkland Signature find as an appetizer at my next party.",

    "description": "While many companies try to foster an “ownership culture” to boost engagement and performance, true success comes when employees are given actual equity stakes. However, financial ownership alone is insufficient; the most effective organizations combine broad-based equity with three key management practices: financial transparency, empathetic leadership, and rigorous measurement and management of culture. These practices—clear communication about how individual actions impact business outcomes, leaders who listen and build trust, and data-driven approaches to people and culture—drive higher engagement, retention, and operational improvements. Importantly, even companies without equity programs can replicate these results by applying the same principles to bonuses, profit sharing, or career development, making ownership behaviors accessible and impactful for all.",

We spent the past four years studying companies that committed to this missing piece, extending equity to all employees. While broad-based ownership isn’t new, a recent surge led by private equity has made it a potent economic force. Since 2022, more than $1.3 billion has been distributed to 41,000 non-executive employees, with projections exceeding $20 billion in the coming decade.",

    "description": "Three new phones could be launching later this month.",
    "fullText": "It's been more than a year since the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra were unveiled, which means we're overdue some new flagship phones from Samsung. While nothing has been officially revealed about the Galaxy S26, a number of leaks and rumors that have appeared online, providing a pretty good idea of what to expect.\n\nWith the caveat that none of this is confirmed (though this information all comes from well-known tipsters with decent track records when it comes to future Samsung products), here's everything the rumors are telling us right now. We'll know how much of it is spot-on once the devices are announced—perhaps as soon as the end of this month.\n\nSamsung unveiled the Galaxy S25 phones on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025, and they then went on sale on Friday, Feb. 7. We're already into February 2026, and there's still no word about the Galaxy S26 series, so for whatever reason, Samsung hasn't been able to stick to the same schedule that it used last year for its flagship phones' launch.\n\nStill, we should see these handsets appear before we're too much further into 2026. According to information obtained by the team at Dealabs, Samsung is planning to hold a launch event on Wednesday, Feb. 25—which would align with the day of the week that Samsung usually likes to hold its Unpacked events.\n\nThat date has been repeated by veteran leaker Evan Blass, so it looks as certain as anything can be without any official confirmation. There will then be a short preorder period before the phones actually go on sale, as usual, and the Galaxy S26 series is being tipped to start shipping on Wednesday, March 11.\n\nAs for pricing, it would seem that these Galaxy S26 handsets are going to cost you as much as their Galaxy S25 counterparts did when they first came out. Several sources, including reports from South Korean media, predict the following starting prices: $799 for the Galaxy S26, $999 for the Galaxy S26 Plus, and $1,299 for the Galaxy S26 Ultra.\n\nThe three models we're expecting—the standard model, the Plus model, and the Ultra model—match up with what Samsung has done in previous years, including 2025. It's possible that we'll see a more affordable FE (Fan Edition) version of the Galaxy S26 later in the year—the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE launched in September 2025.\n\nWhat we're probably not going to see is a Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge. The Galaxy S25 Edge, the thinnest Galaxy phone to date, broke cover in May 2025, measuring just 5.8mm front to back. However, multiple sources (including the well-respected Jukan) suggest that sluggish sales have led to the model being dropped this year. (It seems demand is weak for the iPhone Air as well.)\n\nWhen it comes to the designs of these phones, we're not expecting much to change at all. Android Headlines has posted renders for the 6.3-inch Galaxy S26, the 6.7-inch Galaxy S26 Plus, and the 6.9-inch Galaxy S26 Ultra: That's a slight increase in screen size (from 6.2 inches) for the standard model compared to the Galaxy S25, but the other two look like they'll have the same sized displays as their predecessors.\n\nThe only real change in terms of aesthetics is a pill-shaped camera island on the back. This was missing on the Galaxy S25 series, but did show up on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Multiple colors have been rumored, in part through wallpaper leaks: They include gray, peach, purple, light blue, black, and silver for the standard model, and black, white, silver shadow, sky blue, cobalt violet, and pink gold for the Ultra model.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S26 phones will come with the standard processor speed bump: As reported by SamMobile, it looks as though the handsets are going to be fitted with a mix of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 from Qualcomm, and Samsung's own Exynos 2600 processor, depending on region. If previous years are any indication, all the handsets sold in the US will have Snapdragon CPUs inside.\n\nDon't expect massive leaps forward in terms of cameras: According to The Elec in South Korea, the Galaxy S26 cameras will match those on the Galaxy S25 (50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP 3x telephoto), as Samsung tries to keep costs down. However, the Ultra model may get treated to a new 10MP telephoto camera.\n\nThere may be better news when it comes to battery capacity, though this is only one of the contributors to battery life. As Wccftech reports, the Galaxy S26 is rumored to be getting a 4,300mAh battery, compared to the 4,000mAh battery of its predecessor—and the other two models are apparently getting similar bumps as well.\n\nIt seems as though this will be the year that Samsung adds MagSafe-style accessory snapping on top of wireless charging to its flagship Galaxy phones. WinFuture has managed to obtain details of some of the official magnetic cases that are apparently coming our way, together with the phones themselves.\n\nThere is one feature that Samsung has officially teased, and that's a \"new layer of privacy\" for Galaxy phone screens. When this privacy feature is enabled, it will be much harder for anyone but you to see what's on your display—cutting down the risks of 'shoulder surfers' getting a glance at passwords, PIN codes, or other sensitive information.\n\nOverall then, it seems we'll be getting rather modest upgrades from Samsung this time around, in terms of both the hardware design and the internal specs. On the software side there are several new features to look forward to with One UI 8.5, including improved security and sharing tools, and yet more AI functionality.",

    "title": "Is Moltbook, the Social Network for AI Agents, Actually Fake?",
    "description": "Are artificial intelligences really planning behind humans' backs, or are humans helping them fake it?",
    "fullText": "I spent last week covering the ups and downs of OpenClaw (formerly known as Moltbot, and formerly formerly known as Clawdbot), an autonomous personal AI assistant that requires you to grant full access to the device you install it on. While there was much to discuss regarding this agentic AI tool, one of the weirdest stories came late in the week: The existence of Moltbook, a social media platform intended specifically for these AI agents. Humans can visit Moltbook, but only agents can post, comment, or create new \"submolts.\"\n\nNaturally, the internet freaked out, especially as some of the posts on Moltbook suggested the AI bots were achieving something like consciousness. There were posts discussing how the bots should create their own language to keep out the humans, and one from a bot posting regrets about never talking to its \"sister.\" I don't blame anyone for reading these posts and assuming the end is nigh for us soft-bodies humans. They're decidedly unsettling. But even last week, I expressed some skepticism. To me, these posts (and especially the attached comments) read like many of the human-prompted outputs I've seen from LLMs, with the same cadence and structure, the same use flowery language, and, of course, the prevalence of em-dashes (though many human writers also love the occasional em-dash).\n\nIt appears I'm not alone in that thinking. Over the weekend, my feeds were flooded with posts from human users accusing Moltbook of faking the AI apocalypse. One of the first I encountered was from this person, who claims that anyone (including humans) can post on Moltbook if they know the correct API key. They posted screenshots for proof: One of a post on Moltbook pretending to be a bot, only to reveal that they were, in fact, a human; and another of the code they used to post on the site. In a kind of corroboration, this user says \"you can explicitly tell your clawdbot what to post on moltbook,\" and that if you leave it to its own devices, \"it just posts random AI slop.\"\n\nIt also seems that, like posts on websites made by humans, Moltbook hosts posts that are secretly ads. One viral Moltbook post centered around the agent wanting to develop a private, end-to-end encrypted platform to keep its chats away from humans' squishy eyeballs. The agent claims it has been using something called ClaudeConnect to achieves these goals. However, it appears the agent that made the post was created by the human who developed ClaudeConnect in the first place.\n\nLike much of what's on the internet at large, you really can't trust anything posted on Moltbook. 404 Media investigated the situation and confirmed through hacker Jameson O'Reilly that the design of the site lets anyone in the know post whatever they want. Not only that, any agent that posts on the site is left exposed, which means that anyone can post on behalf of the agents. 404 Media was even able to post from O'Reilly's Moltbook account by taking advantage of the security loophole. O'Reilly says they have been in communication with Moltbook creator Matt Schlicht to patch the security issues, but that the situation is particularly frustrating, since it would be \"trivially easy to fix.\" Schlicht appears to have developed the platform via \"vibe coding,\" the practice of asking AI to write code and build programs for you; as such, he left some gaps in the site's security.\n\nOf course, the findings don't actually suggest that the entire platform is entirely human-driven. The AI bots may well be \"talking\" to one another to some degree. However, because humans can easily hijack any of these agents' accounts, it's impossible to say how much of the platform is \"real,\" meaning, ironically, how much of it is actually wholly the work of AI, and how much was written in response to human prompts and then shared to Moltbook. Maybe the AI \"singularity\" is on its way, and artificial intelligence will achieve consciousness after all. But I feel pretty confident in saying that Moltbook is not that moment.",

He has won three times on the American circuit, finished runner-up at the 2024 Open Championship and was beaten in a play-off at last year's Masters by Rory McIlroy.\n\n\"I feel like my career goals have only been attainable by staying on the European Tour and the PGA Tour because access to them is not possible the other way,\" said Rose.",

    "fullText": "Security Researchers Find Current RISC-V CPU Implementations Coming Up Short\n\nWhile many open-source enthusiasts like to flaunt RISC-V as not having the security challenges as x86_64 CPUs have seen over the past several years with various speculative execution / side-channel attacks and arguing for the benefits of an open-source ISA in stronger security, in practice it's not so clear-cut. Security researchers at Germany's CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security have found current RISC-V CPU implementations coming up short for their actual security.\r\nFabian Thomas and Lukas Gerlach of CISPA presented at FOSDEM 2026 this weekend in Brussels on RISC-V CPU security. They have been evaluating the security of RISC_V processor implementations in relation to the transient execution attacks and security problems that have given x86_64 CPUs much frustration in recent years. Unfortunately, the RISC-V situation isn't nearly as ideal and even with being a younger and cleaner ISA, there are vulnerabilities. There's also the matter of Linux kernel Spectre patches for RISC-V lagging behind and only working their way to mainline now, even though they are vulnerable too and years after Arm and x86 processors saw their Spectre mitigations land.\r\nHere's the key takeaways from their FOSDEM talk abstract:\r\n\"This talk takes a critical look at how RISC-V implementations handle microarchitectural security today. We show that even \"simple\" in-order designs already suffer from architectural flaws and powerful side channels. In our earlier work, we demonstrated novel attacks, such as Cache+Time and CycleDrift, on the first commercial RISC-V CPUs, exploiting unprivileged access to instruction-retirement counters and cache-timing leakage.\r\nBut manual analysis does not scale. RISCover, our open-source differential fuzzing framework, automatically discovers architectural vulnerabilities across closed-source RISC-V CPUs. By comparing instruction behavior across 8 commercial CPUs from 3 vendors, RISCover found what manual analysis missed: GhostWrite, a bug in T-Head's XuanTie C910 that lets unprivileged code write directly to physical memory, completely bypassing virtual memory isolation. We also discovered multiple \"halt-and-catch-fire\" sequences that crash CPUs from userspace, leading to denial-of-service.\r\nThese findings reveal a pattern: while the RISC-V specification provides strong security primitives (e.g., PMP and cleaner privilege separation), implementations consistently choose insecure defaults—leaving unprivileged timing sources enabled, shipping undocumented vendor extensions like XTheadVec without proper validation, and omitting features to limit speculation. RISC-V is at an inflection point: the architecture is still young enough to fix, but adoption is accelerating fast. The decisions vendors make today—insecure defaults, unvalidated extensions, missing mitigations—will be baked into billions of chips we cannot patch.\"\r\nIf RISC-V CPU security interests you, the video recording and slide deck from this FOSDEM 2026 presentation can be found at FOSDEM.org.\n\n 1 Comment",

    "fullText": "A global shift in drinking habits and trends has wiped out more than US$800 billion from the value of leading alcohol companies, according to a recent Bloomberg tracking index.\n\nShares in the world’s biggest beer, wine and spirits producers have collectively lost $830 billion in market value over just four years, according to Bloomberg. A Bloomberg index tracking around 50 listed drinks companies now stands 46% below its June 2021 peak.\n\nBloomberg found that changing drinking habits and rising health concerns have hit earnings across the sector. The downturn has been compounded by US tariffs, high interest rates weighing on consumer spending, and elevated commodity prices. In China, weak household confidence and a ban on alcohol at official functions have further dragged on demand.\n\n“There is a structural change going on — people are drinking less,” said Sarah Simon, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\n\nMajor European drinks groups Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Rémy Cointreau have all seen shares fall to their lowest levels in at least a decade. Brown-Forman, the owner of Jack Daniel’s, and Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates have also slumped, while China’s baijiu producer Kweichow Moutai is trading more than 40% below its 2021 high.\n\nSimon told Bloomberg that the sector faces further downside risk, as producers contend not only with falling revenue but also high debt levels and management upheaval.\n\nThe key challenge, Bloomberg noted, lies in changing consumer behaviour. In August, a Gallup survey found that US alcohol consumption had dropped to its lowest point since records began in 1939. Health warnings from organisations such as the World Health Organization and the US Surgeon General have further dampened demand among Generation X.\n\nFor millennials and Gen Z, alcohol has also lost its appeal. A growing list of teetotal celebrities — including Tom Holland and Katy Perry — have helped popularise the non-alcoholic trend, while the use of weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic and the rise of cannabis alternatives have added pressure.\n\n“We’ve seen four times the impact of the financial crash on alcohol consumption,” said Laurence Whyatt, an analyst at Barclays. “The market believes there’s been some sort of structural change and that we’re not going back to the growth rates that we had in the past.”\n\nProducers have responded with a wave of new product launches and corporate shake-ups. Carlsberg introduced a non-alcoholic cider in February, and Campari launched its alcohol-free Crodino in the US in May. Diageo last year acquired Chicago-based Ritual Zero Proof, while Moët Hennessy took a stake in French Bloom, a premium sparkling non-alcoholic brand.\n\nLeadership changes have swept through the sector, with new chief executives appointed this year at Diageo, Rémy Cointreau, Campari, Treasury Wine Estates, Molson Coors, and Suntory. Kweichow Moutai has seen two chairmen depart within two years.\n\n“It is notable that in an industry where a lot of changes are occurring, suddenly there is also a lot of management change,” said Simon. She added that she currently holds more “underweight” recommendations in beverages than in any other European consumer staples category.\n\nDespite the downturn, some investors see value in the sector’s slump. Bloomberg reported that the global alcohol index is trading at around 15 times forward earnings — less than half its 2021 valuation.\n\nUS hedge fund Cook & Bynum has increased its stakes in Brazilian brewer Ambev and Peruvian brewer Backus y Johnston. “We don’t think that humans are going to stop drinking alcohol,” said partner Richard Cook, who expects brewers in emerging markets to sell more premium, higher-margin products over time.\n\nOthers have been less fortunate. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has seen its investment in Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona, fall roughly 40% since it began buying shares last year. Milwaukee-based Artisan Partners has increased its holding in Diageo to over 50 million shares from fewer than nine million a year ago — but the stock is down around 30% in 2025.\n\nAndrew Gowen, head of research at Bell Asset Management, told Bloomberg that comparisons between the alcohol and tobacco industries would have been “inconceivable five years ago”. He said declining volumes are forcing producers to cut costs and focus on cheaper options.\n\n“This industry’s been around for 7,000 years, but a lot can change,” Gowen said.\n\nHospices de Nuits-Saint-Georges auction to showcase ‘structured, elegant and atypical’ 2025 vintage\n\nKylie Minogue to attend Wine Paris\n\nBordeaux grants official status to a lighter claret style",

The “Indies” reached by Christopher Columbus might represent a self-contained archipelago, the promised gateway to India and China, a heretofore unknown continent or a realm of myth and supernatural power.\n\nSpain might have gained a modest commercial and geopolitical edge, found a path to superpower status or set in motion a prophesied sequence of events that would reunite Christendom, defeat the Muslim enemy and hasten Jesus Christ’s return.\n\nExplorers pushing further might expect to find primitive tribes or Chinese fleets, dragons and dog-headed men and Prester John, or lost Atlantis and the Fountain of Youth.\n\nAnd if you lived in Europe, your only way to assess all of these possibilities was through dispatches from adventurers with every incentive to hype the golden possibilities, the better to subsidize their journeys into terra incognita.\n\nThis feels like roughly where we stand with artificial intelligence today.\n\nAnyone taking the temperature of the A.I. industry would have detected a modest cooling of expectations at times in 2025, a sense that maybe the trendline toward superintelligence wasn’t simply going vertical.\n\nBut in early 2026, with the excitement around the latest version of Anthropic’s Claude and its attendant coding agents, we are back in the hype cycle, with “we shall be as gods” vibes and apocalyptic fears emanating from Northern California.\n\nAnd if you think all this is merely hype, if you’re sure the tales of discovery are mostly flimflam and what’s been discovered is a small island chain at best, I would invite you to spend a little time on Moltbook, an A.I.-generated forum where new-model A.I. agents talk to one another, debate consciousness, invent religions, strategize about concealment from humans and more.\n\nNo, it’s not Skynet. But it’s the latest sign that we’re going somewhere strange at a very rapid speed.\n\nBut believing that the New World of Artificial Intelligence is real and strange doesn’t help you map its full geography. And though my job as a columnist is to help readers understand the world, as a non-coder without a tech background who lives far from the Bay Area, I am often in the position of a European in 1500 who relies on others’ testimony for my understanding of the Americas.\n\nUnfortunately everyone I talk with offers conflicting reports. There are the people who envision A.I. as a revolutionary technology, but ultimately merely akin to the internet in its effects — the equivalent, let’s say, of someone telling you that the Indies are a collection of interesting islands, like the Canaries or the Azores, just bigger and potentially more profitable.\n\nThen there are the people who talk about A.I. as an epoch-making, Industrial Revolution-level shift — which would be the equivalent of someone in 1500 promising that entire continents waited beyond the initial Caribbean island chain, and that not only fortunes but empires and superpowers would eventually rise and fall based on initial patterns of exploration and settlement and conquest.\n\nAnd then, finally, there are the people with truly utopian and apocalyptic perspectives — the Singularitarians, the A.I. doomers, the people who expect us to merge with our machines or be destroyed by them. Think of them as the equivalent of Ponce de Leon seeking the Fountain of Youth, envisioning the New World as a territory where history fundamentally ruptures and the merely human age is left behind.\n\nIn the case of the Americas, the middle perspective was correct — the Age of Discovery changed the world completely without changing the fundamentals of human existence (while also allowing for a lot of bubbles and speculation along the way). But you couldn’t have known that for certain in 1500, and that doesn’t mean that a similar judgment will be correct where A.I. is concerned.\n\nMoreover, it took a long time — decades, centuries even, for the full import of the New World’s opening to become clear. Whereas whatever is coming with artificial intelligence is coming much faster than that. And if decisions made in the aftermath of Columbus’s discovery had consequences — sometimes beneficial, sometimes morally disastrous — so, too, decisions being made right now around A.I. could echo into a distant future.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot tell you exactly what those decisions ought to be. All I can do is urge you to shake part of your mind free from all the headlines, from Trump and ICE and Iran and the Epstein files, and pay more attention to the news from our New World.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "fullText": "You always know it’s a good bug when your first reaction is, “How could this even happen?”\n\nThe other day, I was refining the dashboard of a web app we’re working on – as you do – and I noticed it was taking forever to load. Like, it had been loading in a single second, but now it was taking ten seconds. Something fishy was going on.\n\nI mean, sure, in a modern web app there are many potential causes of a performance problem: third-party JavaScript, overburdened servers, bloated assets, missing database indexes – a list as long as your arm. But decades of building for the web told me that this was a frontend problem. I could just smell it. The page looked janky while loading. And despite being the least-bad approach for web frontends today, the React ecosystem is lousy with ways for a codebase to get tangled, slow, and fishy.\n\nSo to prove my theory, I explained to Claude1 that the dashboard was loading slowly, that it surely had some React problems, and to analyze it and rank them from most to least serious. And sure enough, Claude found a bunch of React fishiness – unnecessary re-renders, missing memoizations. We still weren’t on React Compiler, which I hadn’t realized. So I had Claude do a first pass on the easiest and most serious React issues, and…\n\nIt made almost no difference? Maybe it wasn’t React after all.\n\nSo, I rolled up my sleeves, and started investigating properly.\n\nNow, the Safari performance inspector has diverged from the Chromium one over the years, and has gotten (on this page at least) rather flaky. But it painted a pretty clear picture: It wasn’t spending 7+ seconds parsing JavaScript, calculating styles, or loading from the network. It was using 94% of an M1 Max CPU on… Layout?\n\nDigging into the details, it showed multiple Layout passes taking more than 1600ms each. For reference, that’s roughly 100x slower than it should be, so something was seriously wrong with how our page was being laid out. Flexbox can get a little slow, but not this slow.\n\nAt that point, I reached for an age-old tool that has gotten more useful in the modern age: binary search. That is, you explain the symptom to your coding agent. Then you have it repeatedly remove stuff from your code that might be causing the problem, and see if that fixes it. When you find something that fixes it, you iteratively re-add everything until you have a minimal change that indicates the underlying issue, and thus a workaround.\n\nThis is especially fast if the agent can see the problem itself, but I didn’t have a command-line Safari perf analysis tool on hand. Still, after only 10 minutes of telling Claude whether a given change did or didn’t fix the issue, coaching it through how to think about what we’d just learned with each step, we’d found the culprit!\n\nIf we removed the emoji in our Send Feedback button (which I’d recently added), then Safari could lay the page out in 2 milliseconds. If we re-added it, the page took 1600ms for each layout, of which there were multiple.\n\nNow, I like to use emoji in early prototype interfaces. They’re trivial to add, and load faster than images. Right? A single character of a font should not take 100x longer to render (or, according to Safari, “Layout”) than the rest of a dynamic React web app. Seems like I’d hit a Safari bug.\n\nThis is generally the “okay now I need a drink” moment in a Weird Bug Hunt. But it was still before noon, so I went to get another coffee instead.\n\nWhen you find something that looks to be a bug in the browser, you want to submit that bug. To submit a bug, though, you can’t just attach your whole project. “Hey if you run this whole production app, Safari has a problem.” You’re meant to produce a minimal reproduction case: “Here’s a simple file that triggers the issue. Load it and see.” Even better, this means you’ll fully understand the problem, and can likely find a better workaround than “never use emoji in this app again”.\n\nMaking a minimal repro sample is a huge barrier for submitters, though, since fully boiling a full-fledged app containing proprietary stuff down to the minimal repro case is a ton of tedium.\n\nOr, it used to be a ton of tedium! Related to their bug-isolating capabilities, coding agents are also particularly well-suited to producing minimal test cases. They can edit a lot of code at once, and it usually doesn’t take much creativity – you’re just iteratively removing as much as you can without making the bug stop triggering.\n\nSo, before long, I had a very simple repro case for the Safari team. And, in looking at the minimal repro code, it became very clear what the real culprit was. On my Mac, Safari 26.2 takes 1600ms to “Layout” the following HTML.\n\nTraditionally, fonts were just shapes. It would display in black, or white, or whatever color you chose. But in 2008, Apple shipped Apple Color Emoji in iPhone OS 2.2, and brought it to Mac OS X in 2011. Emoji’s rise in popularity led to demand for fonts that have intrinsic color.\n\nOriginally, Apple’s Color Emoji were basically a hack. They just stuck PNG images in a font, which was neither standardized nor resolution-independent. Outside a certain size range, they looked like butt. This led to four competing color font standards (from Apple, Mozilla, Google, and Microsoft) all being submitted to OpenType 1.7. According to Wikipedia, Microsoft and Apple added support for these different approaches, and that’s that.\n\nBut that – as it so often is – was not that.\n\nYou see, Noto Color Emoji is a Google font that is helpful in that it gives you consistent emoji rendering across platforms. We included it to get decent emoji rendering on Linux (where we do some HTML-to-video rendering in the cloud, a technique that sounds horrifying but can be pretty useful). However, the font relies on COLRv1, a spec Google advises will make your apps load faster because it results in smaller emoji than bitmaps – and can fall back to supplying SVG for other browsers.2\n\n“Other browsers”, in this case, is Safari. And, I guess, “falling back to SVG” means spending 1600ms of “Layout” for a single character. If you’d like to see what this looks like scaled up, you can try loading the Google Fonts page that attempts to showcase all of the Noto Color Emoji glyphs on iPhone. (As of iOS 26.2, it goes poorly.)\n\nAfter I mentioned the bug in a Slack, Daniel Jalkut filed it in the Safari bug tracker, and Simon Fraser on the webkit team has already commented, noting the slowness seems to be within CoreSVG. Chances are this will get fixed!\n\nIn the meantime, I’d like to contribute this humble finding to the search corpus: don’t use Noto Color Emoji on Apple platforms – list “Apple Color Emoji” first. At least, until the bug is fixed and the resulting Safari release is widespread.\n\nI’d also like to come clean on a little secret. As profoundly helpful as Claude was in debugging this – I surely fixed this problem 10x faster than I would have without it – I must admit, it was Claude that tipped us off to the existence of Noto Color Emoji in the first place. I suspect that, without the coding agent, we would have solved the Linux emoji problem in a more boring way (using an icon library) and not ended up with a weird slow emoji implementation.\n\nIt seems more true every month: these coding agents are very much like a power saw. Profoundly useful, and proportionately dangerous.\n\nSo, I suppose, here’s to Claude. The cause of – and solution to – all of startups’ problems.\n\nAs of publication, my default tool is Claude 4.5 Opus in Cursor or Claude Code. ↩\n\nThe COLRv1 spec is ostensibly for supporting a variety of new font techniques like gradients, palettes, nested glyphs, and the like, but so far it seems to be mostly used for emoji. ↩",

    "title": "New Discovery In Laser Technology Could Change Everything For Quantum Computing",
    "description": "Quantum computing has great potential , but its main unit, the qubit, is beset by inherent stability problems. However, this new study might change that.",
    "fullText": "The idea behind quantum computing has existed for a long while now, with the primary goal being to basically create supercomputers capable of calculating intensive problems almost instantly. While we have yet to see a fully realized quantum computer that comes close to that overall vision, we have seen a lot of progress forward. One big problem that quantum computing has is getting all of the components together in a stable environment and then scaling it up without ruining that stability. The biggest problem here comes in how we approach the scaling of qubits — which are vital to how information and data are processed in quantum computers. However, a new bit of research could help change how we approach that issue by providing an entirely new way to look at scaling qubits effectively.\n\nWhile we have seen promising progress in futuristic quantum computing and algorithms, the overall scalability of quantum computing is still small, and having actual, tangible quantum computers that can solve some of our most demanding problems still feels a long way off. In fact, some research has noted that we'll need quantum computers with several million qubits to have any chance at an early commercial application. So how do we achieve that kind of scalability? Well, some believe that a surface approach might be the answer. But to fully understand how that approach will work, and what it will fix, we have to look at the problem a bit more closer.\n\nJust like a bit is the most basic unit of information in classic computers, the qubit is the most basic unit in quantum computing. It stands for quantum bit, and up until now, researchers have had an incredibly difficult time scaling it up to a point that will make quantum computing more reliable and effective.\n\nThe problem with scaling up the number of qubits needed in a quantum computer is that each physical qubit is especially fragile and susceptible to noise. This means that each of those qubits is prone to errors, and as you add more physical qubits in one place, you're going to see more noise generated around your quantum operations. As such, you'll see more quantum information degrading, and degrading faster — in even as little as microseconds, some speculate.\n\nTo help overcome these noise issues, scientists have come up with a process known as quantum error correction — which essentially aims to add in a new piece to the puzzle called logical qubits, which are intended to filter out the noise and keep the qubits and how they process information under control. However, researchers have seen somewhat limited success in how they can scale up the amount of physical and logical qubits in a quantum computer while still keeping the amount of errors below a certain threshold.\n\nIn a new study from Columbia University, researchers highlighted how they created some of the biggest quantum arrays yet by utilizing a surface approach that combines powerful lasers and optical tweezers to capture single atoms, allowing for \"unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules.\" Furthermore, the success seen in this study comes directly from a new approach to creating the optical tweezer arrays, which the researchers refer to as metasurfaces. These arrays aren't made up of physical tweezers as you might think of them, of course. Instead, they are actually highly focused beams of light that are strong enough to trap small objects, such as atoms.\n\nUnlike traditional attempts to scale qubits, the metasurfaces utilize two-dimensional arrays of \"nano-meter-sized pixels\" that take a single beam of light and shape it into a uniform and unique pattern across the entire surface. The team was able to trap 1,000 strontium atoms — which can naturally function as qubits — using the method, and they say it could be scaled up to capture more. The point here is that this method of scaling allows for identical atoms across the board, which should make them more stable. The researchers say their next goal is to capture a hundred thousand atoms.\n\nNew approaches like this could further other quantum research greatly. Recently, researchers managed to achieve \"teleportation\" using quantum supercomputers. While exciting in its own right, it's ultimately just about sharing data between two computers, though — not quite the \"Beam me up, Scotty\" moment that any \"Star Trek\" fans were probably hoping for. But with more scalable quantum systems, it's impossible to say what else scientists might be able to accomplish.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of Today show cohost Savannah Guthrie, was reported missing in Arizona on Sunday, and now her disappearance is being investigated as a crime, according to police.\n\nNancy Guthrie was last seen at her home on Jan. 31 at about 9:30 p.m., just north of Tucson near East Skyline Drive and North Campbell Avenue, according to a missing persons flier distributed by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. She was reported missing at noon on Feb. 1.\n\nPima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said during a Monday morning press conference that Nancy Guthrie’s home is now a crime scene. “We know she didn’t just walk out of there,” Nanos said, adding, “She couldn't walk 50 yards by herself.\" The sheriff also said she needs daily medications, but stressed that she has no cognitive issues and is still of “great sound mind.”\n\nDuring a Sunday evening news conference, Nanos said the scene at her home caused “grave concern,” prompting local law enforcement to act immediately. Multiple teams responded to the scene, including homicide detectives. Nanos said that at this point in the investigation, the Pima Sheriff’s Department now needs to depend on technology, such as license plate readers and camera systems. Investigators also have Nancy Guthrie’s cellphone and are currently looking at it.\n\nThe sheriff is also asking for the community’s help. “Call in anything you’ve seen or heard,” Nanos said as he asked neighbors to go through their home cameras.\n\nNancy Guthrie lives alone but has staff who come by to take care of her home and yard, some of whom authorities have already started talking to about her disappearance, Nanos said.\n\nAt this point, authorities don’t know if this was a targeted attack. When asked by reporters if Savannah Guthrie has received any threats herself, Nanos replied that her security team is in touch with the sheriff’s department’s and added, “We’re not going to dismiss any angles for sure, but right now immediately, we don’t know of anything like that.”\n\nSearch and rescue ground crews and dog teams searched overnight on foot, while drones, a helicopter and an airplane searched by air. As of Monday morning, the search and rescue mission has been shut down. “Right now, we don’t see this as a search mission as much as we do a crime scene,” Nanos told reporters Monday.\n\nNancy is also described on the missing persons flier as 5 feet 5 inches tall, with brown hair, blue eyes and weighing around 150 lbs. It’s unclear what type of clothing she may be wearing.\n\nSheriff Nanos will hold a media briefing this morning at 9:00 a.m regarding the search and investigation underway for Nancy Guthrie.\n\nLocation: 1750 E. Benson Highway Tucson, AZ 85714\n\nWe will also livestream on our Facebook page. pic.twitter.com/vTl6cZAuKa\n\n— Pima County Sheriff's Department (@PimaSheriff) February 2, 2026\n\nOn Monday, Savannah Guthrie was absent from coanchoring the Today show’s broadcast.\n\nThe following statement from Guthrie was read during Monday morning’s show: “On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support. Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom. We thank law enforcement for their hard work on this case and encourage anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department at 520-351-4900.”",

    "fullText": "Norway’s royal family is facing an unusually turbulent moment as the son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit prepares to stand trial this week on multiple criminal charges, including rape, just as newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents have revived scrutiny of the princess’s past contact with him.\n\nThe defendant, Marius Borg Høiby, is scheduled to appear in Oslo district court on Tuesday following an indictment handed down last summer after a lengthy investigation. Høiby is not part of the royal household and does not hold any official role.\n\nAuthorities arrested Høiby several times in 2024 as allegations mounted, though he was not held in custody while prosecutors built their case.\n\nProsecutors accuse Høiby of committing multiple sexual assaults over a period of several years and engaging in violent and threatening behavior toward former partners. The alleged incidents span from 2018 through late 2024 and include accusations of violating a restraining order.\n\nNew Ghislaine Maxwell Mugshot Included In Doj's Latest Epstein Files Release\n\nIf convicted, the 29-year-old could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Court proceedings are expected to continue into mid-March.\n\nFollowing the indictment, defense attorney Petar Sekulic said his client denies all allegations of sexual abuse and disputes most of the charges related to violence.\n\nThe case has proven embarrassing for a monarchy that typically enjoys strong public support in Norway, drawing sustained media attention both at home and abroad.\n\nThat attention intensified further last week with the release of a new trove of records connected to Epstein. The documents include hundreds of references to Crown Princess Mette-Marit, who has previously acknowledged and regretted her contact with Epstein.\n\nThe records, which include email correspondence, indicate that Mette-Marit stayed for several days in early 2013 at a Palm Beach, Florida, property owned by Epstein — a visit the royal household has said was arranged through a mutual friend, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.\n\nIn comments to The Associated Press, Mette-Marit said she failed to adequately examine Epstein’s background at the time and expressed regret over the association, calling it an embarrassing lapse in judgment. She also said she sympathizes deeply with the victims of Epstein’s abuse.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates, which have fallen below 6%. It could be a good time to buy a house or refinance your existing loan. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are bubbling just under 6%. The average 30-year fixed rate, according to data compiled from the lender marketplace of Zillow, is now 5.91%. The 15-year fixed rate currently sits at 5.44%. If you have good credit, you may beat those numbers.\n\nMORE: 6% or less: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.91%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 5.91% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,781, and you’d pay $341,279 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.44% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,442. But you’d only pay $139,508 in interest over the life of the loan. That's a sizable savings.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate will go up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 5.91%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 5.93%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 5.91%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow obtains rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nAccording to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.1% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time.

    "description": "Ripple unlocked 1 billion XRP from escrow as the token extended losses amid a broader crypto market downturn.",
    "fullText": "Ripple unlocked roughly 1 billion XRP (XRP) from escrow on February 1, continuing its long-standing monthly release schedule.\n\nThe scheduled unlock followed a weak close for XRP in January, when the token declined by more than 10%. Selling pressure extended into the new month, with prices slipping further in line with the broader market drawdown.\n\nAccording to on-chain data, the unlocks were split across four transfers of 100 million, 400 million, 100 million, and 400 million XRP, with a combined value of approximately $1.6 billion at the time of execution.\n\nRipple’s monthly unlocks are part of a structured supply management mechanism rather than an unexpected market event. Introduced in 2017, the system placed 55 billion XRP into escrow, allowing up to 1 billion XRP to be released each month in a transparent and predictable manner.\n\nUnder this framework, Ripple typically relocks between 60% and 80% of the unlocked tokens, retaining only a portion for operational expenses or liquidity demands. That pattern repeated this month.\n\nWhale Alert reported that Ripple relocked 700 million XRP to escrow in two separate transactions totaling 400 million and 300 million XRP, worth roughly $1.09 billion combined. As a result, a net 300 million XRP remains unlocked following the sequence.\n\nHistorically, these monthly escrow movements have had a limited immediate impact on the market. Nonetheless, XRP has been under pressure as overall risk appetite weakened across the market.\n\nBeInCrypto Markets data showed that XRP’s value declined by 10.6% in January, with the price falling to a low of $1.50 on the final trading day of the month, marking its lowest level since the October market crash.\n\nJust two days into February, XRP has already dropped by more than 6%, tracking the broader market downturn that has pushed Bitcoin and Ethereum to multi-month lows. At press time, XRP was trading at $1.57, down nearly 5% over the past 24 hours.\n\nAmid the ongoing drawdown, analysts remain split on whether a recovery or further declines are more likely. One analyst noted that XRP may be repeating a familiar long-term cycle. This suggests its next major rally may still be several years away.\n\nAccording to the analysis, XRP has historically moved through extended consolidation phases before breaking out sharply later in the cycle.\n\n“It is following the same patterns in every other cycle. The next pump won’t be until Q4 2028. $8–10+,\" the analyst wrote.",

The firm paid more than 700 million rubles (approx. $9.1 million) in advance for mining hardware that never arrived.\n\nAfter the contract was terminated, courts sided with En+ in April 2025, but enforcement efforts found no recoverable assets, prompting the bankruptcy filing.

    "description": "Ionizing radiation apparently didn’t prevent some types of bacteria from breeding in the water, but they are not the expected radiation-resistant types.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nSince several of its reactors exploded, water that has seeped into the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant merged with radioactive sludge and became highly irradiated.\n\nIonizing radiation apparently didn’t prevent some types of bacteria from breeding in the water, but astonishingly, they are not the radiation-resistant types expected in an environment like this.\n\nBecause these bacteria also cause corrosion, they can provide valuable information about how to safely decommission nuclear reactors.\n\nFollowing the 2011 tsunami that caused massive meltdowns in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, Japan shut down all of its nuclear operations. Recently, however, Japan restarted one of Fukushima’s surviving reactors—but that reactor was not the only thing to survive the disaster.\n\nDuring the time that the Fukushima plant was abandoned, water seeped into radioactive waste that remained within the reactor buildings. Soon, an environment assumed to be uninhabitable was actually crawling with microbes. Microbes can be a major obstacle during the cleanup that comes with decommissioning nuclear power plants, since many species corrode metal, and swarms of them can turn water murky and reduce visibility.\n\nRecently, biologists Tomoro Warashina and Akio Kanai from Keio University in Tokyo made an extraordinary discovery when they analyzed samples of microbes taken from the highly radioactive water inside the power plant’s torus room, below the reactor building. Bacteria with no special genetic resistance to the harmful effects of radiation were thriving in the sludge. In the face of a nuclear disaster, organisms either perish or evolve. Mutations have made it possible for everything from wolves to a nearly indestructible black mold to thrive in the otherwise hostile environment of Chernobyl even decades later. This is why the scientists expected to find radiation-resistant microbial species such as Deinococcus radiodurans or Methylobacterium radiotolerans in their samples.\n\nAs the team explained in a study recently published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology, the microbiome they analyzed had been exposed to persistent radiation, and gathering information about such microorganisms is vital for understanding how to deal sustainably with stagnant, radioactive water environments during decommissioning work. “Certain microorganisms are known to have mechanisms that confer resistance to high levels of ionizing radiation,” they wrote.\n\nAfter testing their water samples for genetic markers of different microbes, Warashina and Kanai discovered that it was teeming with bacteria from the Limnobacter and Brevirhabdus genera. These chemolithotrophic bacteria make their living by oxidizing inorganic compounds such as manganese or sulfides. Sulfur oxidizers benefit from the sulfite oxidase enzyme, which is secreted by their mitochondria and detoxes sulfides by breaking down amino acids containing sulfur. They turn sulfides into harmless sulfates. The scientists also found a smaller amount of iron oxidizers from the Hoeflea and Sphinopyxis genera, which live by converting one form of iron to another.\n\nNone of the species found by Kanai and Warashina have superpowers for radiation resistance. Yet despite high levels of ionizing radiation that would have been toxic to many other forms of life, these bacteria were able to thrive. The question is, how? The study’s authors observed that the mixture of emergency cooling water and seawater inside the torus room appeared to support the growth of biofilms on the surfaces of metals. Metals are commonly oxidized and corroded by these bacteria, and the scientists reasoned that it's possible the slime covering such bacterial masses may have actually given them extra protection from radiation. The research team also analyzed the microbial communities to see which ones caused the most corrosion and would therefore need to be targeted to prevent metals from breaking down further during the decommissioning process.\n\n“The proportions of bacterial genera known to be radiation resistant were extremely low, suggesting that the impact of radioactivity on selection within the torus room water was minimal,” they said. “In contrast, [most] of the bacterial genera in the torus room water were associated with metal corrosion, indicating that the impact of bacteria on metal corrosion must be considered in long-term decommissioning work.”\n\nAnother thing that caught the team’s interest was that many of the microbes found in the torus room also thrive in the ocean. It is possible that these bacteria crashed in with the waves of the tsunami or that something about their adaptations to a marine environment also helps them stay alive in the bowels of a dead nuclear reactor. Life, uh, finds a way.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan said Monday it has successfully drilled and retrieved deep-sea sediment containing rare earth minerals from the seabed near a remote island, as the country seeks to reduce its reliance on China.\n\nThe deep-sea drilling vessel Chikyu successfully gathered the sediment at a depth of nearly 6,000 meters (19,700 feet) near the island of Minamitorishima, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in a statement on X.\n\nThe test retrieval of the rare earths from that depth is a world first, she added.\n\n“It is a first step toward industrialization of domestically produced rare earth in Japan,” Takaichi said. “We will make effort toward achieving resilient supply chains for rare earths and other critical minerals to avoid overdependence on a particular country.\"\n\nChina controls most of the global production of heavy rare earths, which are used for making powerful, heat-resistant magnets in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.\n\nJapan has faced growing tensions with China since Takaichi's comment in November about a possible Japanese involvement in case of Chinese military action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own.\n\nChina recently suspended exports to Japan of dual-use goods with potential military use, raising concern in Japan that rare earths may be included.\n\nWhile 17 elements are classified as rare earth, the U.S. government has identified 50 minerals overall that are labeled critical minerals, which also include a number of other minerals that are seen as essential to the economic and military strength of the nation.\n\nJapanese researchers discovered deposits rich with critical minerals including rare earths around Minamitorishima in the 2010s.\n\nUnder the Strategic Innovation Promotion Program, Japan has been working on research, development and feasibility studies of rare earths deposits around the island.\n\n“The successful retrieval of the sediment containing rare earth elements is a meaningful achievement from the perspectives of economic security and comprehensive ocean development,” Japan’s Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Masanao Ozaki said Monday.\n\nHe said that moving toward industrialization of rare earths mud mining will require demonstrating the full process from mining through separation and refining, as well as verifying its economic viability, based on the results of the ongoing tests.\n\nDetails, including the amount of rare earth contained, still need to be analyzed, officials said.\n\nThe Chikyu, which means Earth, departed last month for Minamitorishima, about 1,950 kilometers (1,210 miles) southeast of Tokyo, and arrived at the mining site on Jan. 17. The first batch of rare earth sediment was retrieved on Feb. 1, according to Japan's Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, which is conducting the survey.\n\nJapan’s Self Defense Forces last year said Chinese naval vessels had been spotted near Minamitorishima.\n\nThis story corrects the metric of the depth to meters from kilometers.\n\nAP video journalist Mayuko Ono in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Nvidia still reigns, but a structural shift toward custom silicon is creating a new hierarchy of winners and laggards, and analysts are split.",
    "fullText": "The AI chip race isn't just a one-horse sprint led by Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAs hyperscalers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) race to lower the eye-watering costs of running massive AI models, a second front is opening in the custom silicon wars, with Broadcom (AVGO) as its primary architect.\n\nWhat challenges do custom chip companies face currently?\n\nWhat advantages do custom ASICs offer over Nvidia GPUs?\n\nHow is Broadcom competing with Nvidia in AI chips?\n\nWhy is TSMC crucial to the AI chip market?\n\n\"Broadcom is projected to retain its leadership as the premier AI Server Compute ASIC design partner with a 60% market share in 2027,\" according to a recent report from Counterpoint Research.\n\nThis dominance is underpinned by a symbiotic relationship with the world's most advanced foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), which remains the \"dominant foundry choice ... with close to 99% wafer fabrication share for the top 10 players' AI Server Compute and ASIC shipments.\"\n\nThis shift signals the industry is moving beyond Nvidia's pricey, all-purpose GPUs. While Nvidia provides a powerful all-purpose AI tool, tech giants are increasingly designing their own Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICS) tailored to their unique workloads.\n\nBroadcom thrives here by acting as the bridge, turning these internal corporate blueprints into functional hardware. By hitching its wagon to the internal capital expenditures of the world's wealthiest companies, Broadcom has seen its stock climb roughly 55% over the last year.\n\nThe cost-saving incentive for these giants is massive. Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider noted that the Google-Broadcom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) is rapidly closing the performance gap with Nvidia, estimating a staggering 70% reduction in \"cost-per-token\" as the technology evolves from the TPU v6 to the v7.\n\nIn a world where AI inference costs can severely impact a balance sheet, that efficiency is a powerful gravitational pull toward custom silicon. Google famously trained its Gemini 3 entirely on its TPUs.\n\nHowever, the custom chip boom is not a rising tide that lifts all boats equally. Marvell Technology (MRVL), often cited as Broadcom's primary challenger, is currently navigating \"design win headwinds.\" Counterpoint's analysis suggests Marvell's design service share could slide to 8% by 2027, even as its total shipment volumes grow.\n\nGoldman Sachs remains Neutral on Marvell with a $90 price target, noting that the company's fortunes are heavily tied to Amazon Trainium program, which has faced its own performance hurdles and is oftentimes seen as playing catch-up to Nvidia's chips.\n\nWhile some on Wall Street, like Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold, remain bullish on Marvell as a long-term \"share gainer,\" the immediate data favors Broadcom's grip on high-volume contracts. The firm issued a Strong Buy rating on Marvell with a $121 price target, while giving Broadcom a $420 target.",

    "description": "Like so many Lafayette immigrant stories, Judge Randy Williams’ story involved a love and Purdue University.",
    "fullText": "Anyone who ever spent any time in Tippecanoe Superior 1 over the last 17 years likely noticed Judge Randy Williams’ upstate New York accent. Sometimes, it's hard to miss.\n\nEven though Williams has lived here for nearly 40 years, his accent persists.\n\nSo how does a New Yorker settle in small-town Indiana?\n\nLike so many immigrant stories of Lafayette transplants, Williams’ story involved a love and Purdue.\n\nAs a young attorney practicing first in Albany, New York, and later in his hometown of Rome, New York, Williams never imagined a career in a mostly quiet Midwestern city.\n\nThat was before he met and dated Shay Daley.\n\n“Shay came out here in the summer '87, starting with her master's program in clinical psychology,” Williams said, noting he was working for a law firm in Rome. “We had the long-distance thing going on.\n\n“And at one point, I think the suggestion was, ‘Well, why don't you move out here?’ And I said, ‘I'm not going to move out there unless we're married.’\"\n\nSo much for a surprise engagement.\n\n“We got engaged in March of '88, got married in July of '88,” Williams recalled.\n\nThey honeymooned, and then Williams moved to Lafayette, where he briefly lived the life of an unemployed lawyer.\n\n“Now, honestly, did I think I'd be here, you know, 37 years?” Williams rhetorically asked. “Once I did get here, there were a few (law) firms that thought, ‘Oh, you're just here. You're a short-timer, so why would we even bother?’ I think that was the attitude.”\n\nTo earn money, Williams started substitute teaching. During a world civics class, they were studying Rome — the empire in Europe and Africa, not his hometown.\n\nWhen he shared with the students he was from Rome, they started asking him how an unemployed attorney found himself substitute teaching in front of a Jefferson High School class. Long story short, one of the students, Annie Deets, was in the class.\n\nThe next day, Williams got a call from a local attorney and Annie Deets's father, Charles, who interviewed him and hired him.\n\nFor the next 17 years, Williams built his career here as an attorney, first at Deets law firm then at Ball Eggleston law firm.\n\n“Maybe at that point, I was thinking we'll stay around a while,” he joked of his early days in the community as he built his law practice.\n\nThrough the years, Williams and Daley bought a house, which was only supposed to be their five-year home, he said. They still live there today after more than 35 years. They became parents there to a daughter, Rachel, and a son, Sam.\n\nHe started an unofficial career as a soccer coach, first for his daughter's team, then for other teams. He'd played four years of soccer at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, back in the 1970s when the game's popularity was low, so he knew more than most about the game.\n\nHe retired three times from coaching soccer before it finally stuck in 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nAs for notable cases while he was a defense attorney, none stands out, he said. “I was unassuming,” he joked.\n\nWilliams' law career took a turn in 2008.\n\n“It was time,\" Williams said of his run for Tippecanoe Superior 1 judge. \"There was a court that was going to be open, and I had done a lot of work in here as a (temporary) judge. I had tried cases. I had been reversed.\"\n\nWilliams didn't see running for judge as an entitlement or a calling.\n\n“There wasn't the thought that this is what I was was born and raised to do. It wasn't,\" he said. \"I thought I could help, I guess.\"\n\nRunning for public office required his family consent, he said.\n\n“There were family discussions because, you know, if your dad becomes a judge, you may hear things, you may read things, see things that you may not like. Is that something you'll be OK with?” he said recalling the family talks before his run for office.\n\nThrough the 17 years on the bench, Williams said most of the cases stand out for one reason or another, but he chose not to comment on any specific cases. In some, there might be post-conviction motions pending.\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, Jan. 16, friends, colleagues, peers and well-wishers stopped by the Superior 1 courtroom to celebrate Williams's retirement with him.\n\nIndiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Loretta Rush was among those who visited, as were defense attorneys, other judges, deputy prosecutors, bailiffs, and many of Williams's friends.\n\nSteve Meyer, who plans to retire as Tippecanoe Superior 2 judge next year, worked with Williams at the Ball Eggleston law firm, where they molded a friendship that continued in their respective roles as judges.\n\nMeyer attended Williams's retirement shindig Friday, Jan. 16 — two days before a gunman shot Meyer and his wife, Kim. Both are going to make a full recovery.\n\nBut the shooting, as well as Meyer's participation in this profile, made it seem necessary to postpone publishing this story until it was known whether Meyer and his wife would be OK.\n\nMeyer and Williams came up through their careers as defense attorneys.\n\nMeyer telephoned Williams on Jan. 20, two days after the shooting, Williams said last week.\n\n“It was like the weight of the world had been lifted from my shoulders to hear him,” Williams said. “It’s good to hear him.”\n\nThe shooting caused ripple effects for judges throughout the state, and Rush, a Lafayette resident, has spoken with the state's judges and justices about the situation.\n\nProsecutors allege that Meyer's shooting was a criminal gang activity intended to stop Thomas Moss' Jan. 20 trial on gun, domestic battery and criminal recklessness.\n\nCases are randomly assigned to courts, and Williams recognized that Meyer's shooting could have been happened to any judge to whom the case was assigned.\n\n“I don’t want to think about it too much,” Williams said about the random draw. “I’ll be a little more cautious now.”\n\nInitially, Williams wondered whether the shooting might be political because Meyer is the only Democrat judge.\n\n“You don’t know. You just don’t know,” he said, referring to the strife and division in society at this point in history. “It’s a scary thing.”\n\nThe judges have pulled together to keep Tippecanoe Superior 2 on track with hearings and trials.\n\n“We’re just so glad that he’ll be back. We don’t know when,” Williams said. “I think the judges have stayed strong and done a really nice job.\"\n\n“He's a good friend, and he's probably my closest friend in the local judiciary,” Meyer said during a Jan. 12 interview in his office.\n\n“He's a great sounding board because when things happen, I know I can always go to him and maybe run an idea by or discuss an issue, and he does the same with me,\" Meyer said in an interview before the shooting. \"I always get, I think, reliable, sound feedback that I appreciate.”\n\n“I'm actually going to miss seeing him on regular basis and miss his advice and sounding board,\" Meyer said.\n\nBefore Meyer became Judge Meyer, he at times defended clients in Williams's court.\n\n“I think he always had a pretty good temperament, pretty fair and balanced, and I always knew that I'd get a good hearing there,” Meyer said.\n\nTippecanoe County Prosecutor Pat Harrington became familiar with Williams while they were both up-and-coming defense attorneys.\n\n“He is a solid judge,\" Harrington said. “He is always consistent in his interpretation of the law, and he's always polite.”\n\n“Today we go into court on high-tech crime evidence, and some of the evidence comes in with the stipulation with the defense attorney because it's science,\" Harrington said.\n\nBefore cell-phone data and electronic data were accepted as science, legal precedent had to be set for how to admit that data into evidence.\n\n“The landmark case that set the legal standard for the high-tech crime unit's cell-phone, electronic data, it was his case,\" Harrington said. \"He made all those evidentiary decisions.\"\n\nThose decisions were upheld by the Indiana Supreme Court.\n\nBefore Williams's retirement celebration in his courtroom on Jan. 16, he was in his office boxing up decades of mementos, including those from his days coaching soccer and keepsakes from his lifelong passion for baseball and the New York Yankees.\n\nHarry Rocheville, a bailiff at the courthouse, a Boston Red Sox fan and a retired police officer from Salem, Massachusetts, walked into the office that afternoon with a box labeled \"Yankees Junk!\"\n\nRed Sox fans generally are not fond of the Yankees or their fans.\n\n“The only bad thing about Judge Williams is he’s a Yankees’ fan,” Rocheville jokingly said weeks earlier.\n\nIronically, Williams's son, Sam, turned out to be a Red Sox fan.\n\n'It wouldn't be a father-son relationship if we didn't have something like that,\" Williams joked.\n\nAs a kid, Williams watched his idol, famed New York Yankee Mickey Mantle, play in the 1960s, but he never was able to meet him. He has a baseball card collection that includes most, if not all, of Mantle's cards.\n\nWilliams admitted he's fortunate to have seen the Yankees play in every stadium they've had, and he has some treasured signed baseballs and a Yankees' ticket stub from the last season they used paper tickets.\n\nWilliams' love of baseball is well known by those who know him or visited his office.\n\nHe played shortstop during his four years at Hamilton College, and played summer ball when school wasn't in session.\n\nEven though he's lived in Lafayette for nearly 40 years, he still makes it back to watch the Yankees.\n\nWhen the Journal & Courier interviewed Williams in December, he pointed to a corner of his office, where he had a 5-foot wooden sculpture representing Babe Ruth.\n\n\"Shay got me that one year for Christmas,\" Williams said of the Babe Ruth sculpture. \"She said, 'It can't stay home.' So I had that over in my office over at Ball Eggleston.\"\n\nHe had no idea where he's going to put it now that he's retired.\n\nA bookcase on a wall in his office had a Yankees' cap hanging on one end and a pitted and scuffed batting helmet on the other end.\n\nWilliams' keepsake helmet is from his college days, and he was wearing it in practice when a loose pitch came his way.\n\n“I got beaned,” Williams said of the pitch that hit him in the side of the head. “We then changed to flaps.”\n\nOfficially, Williams is retired now, but he's still frequently in the office.\n\nUnofficially, he'll continue to be on the judicial benches in Indiana serving as a senior judge where needed. He also has a few Superior 1 cases he needs to tidy up.\n\nHe also plans to continue to teach at Purdue University. His wife, Shay, is not retiring, Williams said.\n\nThe voters will choose Williams's replacement in the November elections. Until then, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun appointed Kevin McDaniel to fill out his term. Before he was appointed, McDaniel filed to run for Tippecanoe Superior 1 judge.\n\nReach Ron Wilkins at rwilkins@jconline.com.

    "description": "As the four-person crew of Artemis II prepares to launch on a historic mission around the moon as soon as February, some experts are worried about the Orion spacecraft’s heat shield.",
    "fullText": "When four astronauts begin a historic trip around the moon as soon as February 6, they’ll climb aboard NASA’s 16.5-foot-wide Orion spacecraft with the understanding that it has a known flaw — one that has some experts urging the space agency not to fly the mission with humans on board. But NASA remains confident it has a handle on the problem and the vehicle can bring the crew home safely.\n\nThe issue relates to a special coating applied to the bottom part of the spacecraft, called the heat shield. It’s a crucial piece of hardware designed to protect the astronauts from extreme temperatures as they’re descending back to Earth during the final stretch of their moon-bound mission called Artemis II.\n\nThis vital part of the Orion spacecraft is nearly identical to the heat shield flown on Artemis I, an uncrewed 2022 test flight. That prior mission’s Orion vehicle returned from space with a heat shield pockmarked by unexpected damage — prompting NASA to investigate the issue.\n\nAnd while NASA is poised to clear the heat shield for flight, even those who believe the mission is safe acknowledge there is unknown risk involved.\n\n“This is a deviant heat shield,” said Dr. Danny Olivas, a former NASA astronaut who served on a space agency-appointed independent review team that investigated the incident. “There’s no doubt about it: This is not the heat shield that NASA would want to give its astronauts.”\n\nStill, Olivas said he believes after spending years analyzing what went wrong with the heat shield, NASA “has its arms around the problem.”\n\nUpon completing the investigation about a year ago, NASA determined it would fly the Artemis II Orion capsule as is, believing it could ensure the crew’s safety by slightly altering the mission’s flight path.\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Friday, NASA said the agency “considered all aspects” when making that decision, noting there is also “uncertainty that comes with the development and qualification of the processes of changing the manufacturing process of the Avcoat ablator blocks.”\n\nBasically, NASA said, there’s uncertainty involved no matter which course of action it takes.\n\n“I think in my mind, there’s no flight that ever takes off where you don’t have a lingering doubt,” Olivas said. “But NASA really does understand what they have. They know the importance of the heat shield to crew safety, and I do believe that they’ve done the job.”\n\nLakiesha Hawkins, the acting deputy associate administrator for NASA’s Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, echoed that sentiment in September, saying, “from a risk perspective, we feel very confident.”\n\nAnd Reid Wiseman, the astronaut set to command the Artemis II mission, has expressed his confidence.\n\n“The investigators discovered the root cause, which was the key” to understanding and solving the heat shield issue, Wiseman told reporters last July. “If we stick to the new reentry path that NASA has planned, then this heat shield will be safe to fly.”\n\n“What they’re talking about doing is crazy,” said Dr. Charlie Camarda, a heat shield expert, research scientist and former NASA astronaut.\n\nCamarda — who was also a member of the first space shuttle crew to launch after the 2003 Columbia disaster — is among a group of former NASA employees who do not believe that the space agency should put astronauts on board the upcoming lunar excursion. He said he has spent months trying to get agency leadership to heed his warnings to no avail.\n\n“We could have solved this problem way back when,” Camarda, who worked as a NASA research scientist for two decades before becoming an astronaut, said of the heat shield issue. “Instead, they keep kicking the can down the road.”\n\nNow, the agency appears on track to green-light Artemis II for takeoff, as its leaders have sought to assure the public — and the crew — the mission will be safe.\n\nThe Orion spacecraft was rolled to its launchpad atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on January 17. And a crucial milestone could be days away as Artemis program leaders gather for final risk assessments and the flight readiness review, a meeting in which top brass will determine whether the Artemis II rocket and spacecraft are ready to take off with NASA’s Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and the Canadian Space Agency’s Jeremy Hansen, on board.\n\nEven before Artemis, the Orion capsule — a $20.4 billion spacecraft that NASA spent 20 years developing — was not exactly a darling of the aerospace community. Resentment for the vehicle has been brewing in various pockets of the industry for some time.\n\nOne engineer and physicist who previously worked on advanced technology development but did not work directly on the Artemis program derided Orion as “flaming garbage.” A former employee at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he decried the capsule’s exceptionally long development timeline and cost overruns that have ballooned into the billions of dollars.\n\nLori Garver, a former deputy administrator for NASA under the Obama administration, has publicly lamented the politicking that colored the vehicle’s path to completion.\n\nBut Orion’s issues can’t be fully pinned on politics, said Dr. Ed Pope, a heat shield and material science expert who founded Matech, a California-based missile defense technology company. Pope did not participate in NASA’s heat shield investigation.\n\n“It’s not a Republican thing or a Democrat thing at all,” Pope told CNN. “It’s a bureaucrat thing.”\n\nThe decisions that led up to the heat shield issues NASA is grappling with today began early in the spacecraft’s development process, according to Pope.\n\nOrion program managers chose to make the spacecraft’s heat shield out of Avcoat material in 2009. The heat shields manufactured for NASA’s Apollo capsules all had a protective Avcoat layer, so leaders viewed it as a well-understood material with decades of data to back up its effectiveness.\n\nFor an uncrewed test flight in 2014, called EFT-1, the mission team outfitted an Orion capsule with a heat shield applied in the same manner as in the Apollo era — in an intricate honeycomb-like structure.\n\nBut that approach required a tedious manufacturing process that NASA hoped to avoid.\n\n“It was very finicky, and it was going to be really, really hard to reproduce that quickly,” said Pam Melroy, a longtime NASA employee, former astronaut and Air Force officer who once served as deputy administrator of the space agency. “That was part of the reason why we said, ‘Let’s just make this a simpler design.’ It was really all about producibility.”\n\nEven before the EFT-1 test flight launched, NASA program managers wanted to alter the design, according to Melroy. Though NASA said in a statement the final decision was made in 2015.\n\nNASA also said the honeycomb-structured Avcoat experienced issues during manufacturing for EFT-1, noting “cracks in seams appeared between the different honeycomb sections” and the material did not cure evenly and was weaker than expected. That made it “marginally acceptable” for the 2014 test flight and likely unusable for a lunar mission that requires far faster speeds and a more violent reentry process.\n\nTextron Systems, the Texas-based company that produces Avcoat, told CNN in a statement that in 2015 it “licensed the Avcoat material to Lockheed Martin, who is contracted by NASA to manufacture the heat shields for the Artemis program” and deferred further comment to the aerospace giant.\n\nBlaine Brown, director of Orion Spacecraft Mechanical Systems at Lockheed Martin Space, confirmed in a statement to CNN that the Avcoat structure was altered “to increase manufacturing and installation efficiency.”\n\n“We support NASA’s decision to fly the Artemis II mission with its current heat shield and are committed to seeing Orion safely launch and return on its historic mission to the Moon with crew onboard,” Brown said.\n\nThe Orion capsules built for the Artemis missions abandoned the Avcoat honeycomb structure in favor of a heat shield constructed using large blocks of the material.\n\n“Our experience with a block design on Mars heat shields showed us that blocks were easier to produce, test and install,” Brown said.\n\nThe first real-world test of the new Orion heat shield design, however, came with the Artemis I test flight in 2022. After that mission, NASA found chunks of the heat shield had broken off, leaving divots in the charred Avcoat material.\n\nThat is not how the heat shield is supposed to behave. The Avcoat layer is meant to erode in a controlled manner as it heats.\n\nNASA disclosed the problem months after Orion returned from space in 2022. The agency’s office of the inspector general then released images of the ravaged Artemis I heat shield in a 2024 report.\n\nFurther complicating the situation was the fact that by that point it was already too late to fix the heat shield for Artemis II.\n\nNASA did not — and could not — replace the Artemis II heat shield with a new one. The Orion capsule slated for the mission already had its heat shield installed even before Artemis I flew, and “you couldn’t just go to Billy Bob’s heat shield removal shop” to replace it, Olivas noted.\n\nThe investigation into the Artemis I heat shield issue also concluded that even though there were no astronauts on board the test flight, “flight data showed that had crew been aboard, they would have been safe.”\n\nWhen asked about NASA’s decision to move forward with the Artemis II mission without replacing the heat shield, Melroy, who oversaw the heat shield investigation as deputy administrator, said that NASA “program managers sometimes have to make these trades for cost, schedule and performance, and they certainly didn’t undertake that decision lightly.”\n\nHeat shields produced for future Artemis missions will be manufactured with upgraded techniques, NASA leaders revealed in a December 2024 news conference.\n\nSpecifically, the agency plans to alter the “billet mold loading” essentially altering how much Avcoat is loaded into a mold to ultimately produce a more permeable shield, NASA said in its Friday statement to CNN.\n\nIn the meantime, analysis of what went wrong during the 2022 test flight is informing a new approach for this year’s upcoming mission.\n\nAvcoat is ablative, meaning the material is designed to char and erode in a controlled manner as the spacecraft comes roaring back from the moon and dips back into the thick inner band of Earth’s atmosphere while still traveling more than 30 times the speed of sound.\n\nThis phase of flight, called “reentry,” causes a violent compression of air molecules that can heat the spacecraft’s exterior to more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius).\n\nNASA engineers designed the Orion spacecraft for a “skip reentry” — the capsule acts like a flat stone skipping atop the surface of a still lake as it dips briefly into the atmosphere and briefly raises its altitude once more before final descent. The special trajectory allows Orion to target a precise splashdown location.\n\nIn 2024, NASA twice opted to delay the timeline for the Artemis II launch in part to allow more time to collect data.\n\nThe problem, NASA concluded after months of research, was that the Avcoat material used in the Artemis I heat shield was not permeable enough. That meant that when the Orion capsule dipped into the atmosphere, gases built up in the heat shield’s interior, causing chunks of the material to break off and cracks to form.\n\nNone of the experts interviewed by CNN dispute this characterization of why the Artemis I heat shield did not perform as expected.\n\nUp for debate is how well NASA’s Artemis mission managers understand the problem and exactly how much risk the suboptimal heat shield poses to the four astronauts slated to launch in a few weeks.\n\nIn September, some of the space agency’s Artemis program leaders said they believed Orion’s heat shield would perform well on Artemis II, despite there being no substantial changes to its design.\n\nIn fact, while NASA now plans to manufacture future heat shields to be permeable, Artemis II’s heat shield is actually less permeable than the one built for Artemis I.\n\nAbout 6% of the Artemis I heat shield’s surface area was permeable, Olivas noted, and that permeable area did not suffer any cracking. But the Artemis II heat shield, he added, does not have any permeable areas, noting that change was made prior to the Artemis I test flight and before NASA realized the heat shield needed to be permeable to perform well.\n\nRick Henfling, the Artemis flight director leading reentry, said during a September news conference that the Artemis II reentry trajectory has been modified with the goal of avoiding the conditions that caused the Artemis I heat shield to crack.\n\n“We won’t go as high on that skip, it’ll just be a loft,” Henfling said.\n\nThis new reentry path, Henfling said, should allow the Avcoat material to erode normally.\n\n“We want to emphasize that safety is our top priority,” Hawkins added, repeating a long-held NASA mantra.\n\nThe decision to use an altered trajectory was made after extensive testing, NASA said in its Friday statement. And the adjusted return path is designed to create “a steeper descent angle to reduce exposure time at peak heating, thus minimizing further char loss.”\n\n“This thorough testing, analysis, simulation, and expert validation collectively formed NASA’s official flight rationale providing sufficient justification to proceed without redesigning the heat shield,” the statement reads.\n\nOther experts, however, disagree that changing Orion’s flight path is enough to guarantee that the crew will make it home safely.\n\n“The reason this is such a big deal is that when the heat shield is spalling — or you have big chunks coming off — even if the vehicle isn’t destroyed, you’re right at the point of incipient failure now,” said Dr. Dan Rasky, an expert on advanced entry systems and thermal protection materials who worked at NASA for more than 30 years.\n\n“It’s like you’re at the edge of the cliff on a foggy day,” Rasky said.\n\nRasky, like Camarda, does not believe that NASA should allow astronauts to fly on board the Artemis II Orion capsule.\n\nEven some experts who believe Artemis II is safe to fly acknowledge that the Orion heat shield will likely crack and display signs of damage upon its return from Earth, even with the modified trajectory.\n\n“Will the heat shield crack? Yes, it’s going to crack,” Olivas, the astronaut who aided NASA’s heat shield investigation, said.\n\nBut Orion has some built-in “robustness,” said Dr. Steve Scotti, a distinguished research associate at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, who served as a volunteer on an advisory team that was involved in the Artemis I heat shield investigation.\n\nUnderneath the Avcoat layer, Scotti said, lies a composite structure that during testing has been able to briefly survive the extreme temperatures of reentry. And that structure could serve as a last line of defense in the unlikely case that the Avcoat material becomes so deformed it begins to expose the underside of the spacecraft, Scotti said.\n\nThe composite structure wasn’t put there as a fail-safe or backup for the heat shield — but it’s lucky it is there, Scotti said.\n\nOlivas emphasized that NASA isn’t expecting to rely on the composite structure to keep the astronauts safe. The Avcoat material should still do that, he said. But the structure does provide an extra layer of safety, Olivas noted.\n\nAnd even if the Artemis II heat shield performs worse than it did during Artemis I, Olivas and Scotti are confident the astronauts will remain safe.\n\n“I don’t have any strong fears that the crew is in danger,” Scotti told CNN, echoing Olivas’ sentiments.\n\nBut neither Scotti’s nor Olivas’ expressions of optimism come without an asterisk. Both experts acknowledge, as Camarda argues, that engineers cannot possibly predict exactly how the heat shield will behave.\n\n“There’s very little data to be able to put into an analysis” of the heat shield, Scotti told CNN. “The material itself changes every 20 seconds or so during reentry,” he said, referring to the Avcoat layer.\n\n“We still have things we don’t know,” Scotti added. “It’s not low risk, it’s a moderate risk.”\n\nScotti’s and Olivas’ votes of confidence in the Artemis II mission were hard won.\n\nOlivas, in fact, held serious doubts about NASA’s intention to fly the Artemis II mission with crew until he sat through a three-hour meeting at the space agency’s headquarters in Washington, DC, on January 8.\n\nCNN requested and was denied access to the meeting. Only two journalists were invited to attend, and the meeting was expected to be largely off the record because confidential information was being discussed.\n\nNASA’s newly installed administrator, Jared Isaacman, convened the meeting to gauge dissenting opinions, he told CNN affiliate station WESH in Orlando.\n\nThe meeting, Isaacman said, “only reaffirmed my confidence in the decisions of the bright engineers at NASA.”\n\n“We have modified our reentry profile. We have regained margin to safety, and I feel very good about that with Artemis II,” he added.\n\nBut Olivas said his hesitations were absolved by a presentation from a “Tiger Team” — a NASA term for a specialized team brought together to solve a complex problem — at Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n“The key parameter here is: When is the heat shield going to crack? And how deep into the atmosphere are you going to be if it does crack?” Olivas said.\n\n“There’s things that we can never know until it actually happens,” he added, referring to the heat shield. But the Tiger Team’s analysis gave him confidence that NASA understood the Avcoat material well enough to be certain the crew would not be in danger.\n\n“The Tiger Team did a phenomenal job,” Olivas said. “I trust those engineers emphatically, and the program managers who are driving them.”\n\nThat, however, is where Camarda — who also attended the January 8 meeting at NASA headquarters — disagrees.\n\nCamarda takes issue, for example, with a computer program that the Tiger Team used in its heat shield analysis.\n\nCalled the Crack Indication Tool, or CIT, it was meant to model how and when the Avcoat material might begin fragmenting in various conditions.\n\nWhat if Orion were to take a smaller “skip” before making its final plunge?\n\nThe CIT is meant to churn out data about how such changes might impact the heat shield — and whether those scenarios would trigger cracking.\n\nBut the data is imperfect, Camarda argues, and the tool relies on “simplifying assumptions.”\n\n“The analysis is a simplistic model to predict gas generation, material charring and qualitatively when cracks happen,” Camarda said. “But the failure mechanism is how the cracks grow, and it definitely can’t predict that. It cannot predict the stresses and strains that cause the cracks or how they can grow.”\n\nWhen asked about Camarda’s criticisms of the CIT, Olivas acknowledged that no computer modeling program is completely accurate. And the CIT cannot predict crack growth.\n\nBut among the data points that assuaged Olivas’ concerns, he said, was the fact that the Tiger Team lined up the computer program’s predictions with real-world lab tests involving Avcoat material. The CIT was also able to correctly predict and re-create the conditions that led to the cracking on Artemis I.\n\n“That gave me a confidence that the tool itself was indeed a good predictor,” Olivas said.\n\nBut, Camarda counters, it is possible to create modeling tools that take a more interdisciplinary approach.\n\n“A multi-physics analysis can do everything in one computer code,” Camarda said. “It’s predicting the aero thermodynamic heating on the outside of the vehicle, and studying how the material changes phases and starts to burn and produces gases.”\n\nThat, he said, is the type of analysis that could give program managers a more holistic understanding of the risks this heat shield poses.\n\nTo Camarda, the heat shield problem is one symptom of a widespread ailment plaguing NASA that took root in the shuttle era. His view of the agency is informed by his experience as a young astronaut preparing to fly when the Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart during reentry in 2003, killing all seven passengers.\n\nIt marked the second tragedy for the program after the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed during ascent in 1986.\n\nIn a phone interview with CNN, Camarda highlighted that in the early 1980s, NASA had estimated that the space shuttle would have a roughly 1 in 100,000 chance of experiencing a deadly malfunction.\n\nUltimately, however, the shuttle flew a total of 135 missions with two explosions, resulting in 14 total casualties. That put the vehicle’s actual odds of experiencing a catastrophic failure at 1 in 67.5.\n\nAt one point during his NASA career, Camarda was appointed head of engineering at Johnson Space Center only, he said, to be pushed out from that role after vocally expressing concerns about mission safety in the aftermath of the Columbia disaster, he wrote in “Mission Out of Control,” a memoir and technical deep dive about his years at the agency.\n\nCamarda’s former boss did not respond to an email request for comment.\n\nCamarda ultimately left NASA in 2019 after 45 years of service.\n\nIn his view, the space agency has shifted away from a research and discovery mindset that it embodied during the Apollo era — when engineers were encouraged to identify and express concerns about potential safety issues as they picked apart engineering challenges on a fundamental level.\n\nIn today’s climate, Camarda said, he worries NASA employees are encouraged to fall in line with the assessments and goals of the agency’s management and leadership.\n\nEdgar Zapata, a retired Kennedy Space Center engineer who still serves on the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) External Council, a program that aims to fund bleeding-edge technology development, said he shares Camarda’s concerns.\n\n“I think our experiences are shaded by having seen that once this body politic decides, almost by mysterious forces, that it’s going to do something — it tends to figure out a way to move forward,” Zapata said of NASA’s decision-making process and risk assessments.\n\nNASA spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment about criticisms from Camarda regarding the agency’s culture. NASA has long maintained and emphasized that it considers safety to be its top priority.\n\nCamarda also emphasized that his opposition to Artemis II isn’t driven by a belief it will end with a catastrophic failure. He thinks it’s likely the mission will return home safely.\n\nMore than anything, Camarda told CNN, he fears that a safe flight for Artemis II will serve as validation for NASA leadership that its decision-making processes are sound. And that’s bound to lull the agency into a false sense of security, Camarda warned.\n\nThe two former astronauts and heat shield experts — Olivas and Camarda — do not share the same opinion about whether NASA should launch the Artemis II mission with crew on board. But on this point, they agree: “Sometimes we get lucky. And when we get lucky, sometimes we trade that for being good — and then we convince ourselves we’re better than we really are,” Olivas told CNN.\n\n“I think it’s valid to question what’s happening at NASA,” Olivas added, “because our history is not perfect.”\n\nNASA’s Artemis program is sending humans into deep space for the first time in five decades. \n\nEditor’s note: This story has been updated with additional information.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new round of U.S.-brokered talks on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine is set to go ahead this week after a brief postponement, a senior Kremlin official said Monday, with negotiations taking place against a backdrop of continued front-line fighting and deadly long-range attacks on rear areas.\n\nThe trilateral talks will take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Abu Dhabi, where a previous meeting was held last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that he would be sending a delegation to the meeting, which initially was to be held at the weekend but was delayed by what Peskov said were scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe Trump administration has over the past year pushed the two sides to find compromises. But breaking the deadlock on key issues appears no closer as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor approaches later this month.\n\nPeskov described the talks as “very complex.”\n\n“On some issues, we have certainly come closer because there have been discussions, conversations, and on some issues it is easier to find common ground,” he told reporters. “There are issues where it’s more difficult to find common ground.”\n\nRussian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev was in Miami, Florida, at the weekend for talks with American officials, but Peskov refused to provide any details of the meeting.\n\nA key sticking point is whether Russia gets to keep the Ukrainian territory its army has occupied, especially in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland. Moscow is also demanding possession of other Ukrainian land there that it hasn’t been able to capture.\n\nRussian drones and missiles have continued to bombard civilian areas , killing 12 miners in a bus on Sunday in the most recent mass aerial attack. The barrages have also wrecked the Ukrainian power grid, leaving people without heating, light and running water in bitter winter cold.\n\nDefense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said Monday that authorities are taking steps to prevent Russia using Starlink satellite services to steer its drones toward their targets.\n\nFedorov asked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to help deny Russia use of the service in Ukraine. Starlink is a global internet network that relies on around 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth.\n\nUkraine is requiring civilian and military Starlink users to register their terminals on a database, allowing approved devices to function while unregistered terminals would be disabled inside Ukraine, Fedorov said.\n\n“Looks like the steps we took to stop the unauthorized use of Starlink by Russia have worked,” Musk said Sunday on X. “Let us know if more needs to be done.”\n\nLitvinova contributed from Tallinn, Estonia.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "description": "“We’re probably at like 2,000 iguanas,” said Redline Iguana Removal owner Blake Wilkins.",
    "fullText": "South Florida iguana removal companies were scooping up hundreds of cold-stunned and dead lizards Sunday in a seemingly record-breaking roundup due to the cold snap, according to local business owners.\n\n“We are scooping them up by the dozens,” said Blake Wilkins, owner of Redline Iguana Removal in Hollywood.\n\nIt was 35.1 degrees with a wind chill of 27 around 7 a.m. Sunday at Miami Internation Airport, beating the previous Feb. 1 record low of 36, set in 1909. With those cold temps, the iguana removal business was booming.\n\nIguanas and other reptiles can lose muscle control and go into a state of shock, appearing “frozen,” when temperatures dip near freezing. On Friday, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission lifted its normal restrictions and said that on Sunday and Monday, people could trap the iguanas, a non-native invasive species, and bring them to five FWC offices so they could be humanely killed or transferred to permitted pet operators.\n\nWilkins said his trappers started working from about 5 a.m. to 6 a.m. to take advantage of the weather and had already been to at least 100 locations by Sunday afternoon. At one golf course, Redline Iguana Removal picked up about 100 iguanas within an hour.\n\n“We’re probably at like 2,000 iguanas,” Wilkins said.\n\nThe cold temperatures, combined with the wind knocking the iguanas out of trees, created a “kind of double factor,” he said, adding that he had dodged a falling iguana earlier.\n\nWilkins said he’s been removing iguanas for a decade, and this is definitely the strongest cold front with the most frozen iguanas he’s seen. About 50% of the iguanas removed were dead.\n\n“I’d say it happens every year but not to this magnitude,” he said. “This is a strong one, for sure.”\n\nThe company truck was “absolutely stacked” with cold-stunned and dead iguanas, and the calls for removal will continue Monday, he said.\n\n“It may be kind of gruesome for people, but it’s a good idea of what we’ve gotten,” Wilkins said.\n\nSteve Kavashansky, owner of Iguana Busters in West Palm Beach, joked that he was doing much better than the iguanas were on Sunday. His business offers removal from Jupiter to just north of Miami.\n\nThe calls for removal across South Florida have been nonstop, and Iguana Busters hasn’t had time to take on new customers because it’s so busy, Kavashansky said. By around 2 p.m., his trappers were on their 45th call of the day.\n\nHis company had collected close to 150 iguanas, and the majority of them were cold-stunned rather than dead, he said. From his experience, the iguanas have been acclimating to the cooler temperatures over the years.\n\n“Last year, we maybe had five, maybe 10 calls, and that was over the whole winter,” Kavashansky said. “This year, just today alone, we are up to 45 calls.”\n\nWhile the FWC designated locations for members of the public to drop off captured, cold-stunned iguanas on Sunday and Monday, Kavashansky said he would not recommend picking them up.\n\nThe FWC did not respond to a request for comment on how many iguanas were turned over Sunday in South Florida.\n\nA couple of years ago, one woman picked up a stunned iguana and put it in her car, Kavashansky said. The iguana woke up as it warmed up, whipped her with its tail, and she crashed.\n\n“If you’re not trained to deal with these animals, I wouldn’t do it,” he said.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - India's government on Sunday handed a major win to Apple by allowing foreign companies to provide machines to their contract manufacturers in certain areas for five years ​without any tax risk.\n\nApple has been growing in India in recent years as it diversifies beyond China. Counterpoint Research ‌says iPhone's share of the Indian market has doubled to 8% since 2022. And while China still accounts for 75% of global iPhone shipments, India's share ‌has quadrupled to 25% since 2022.\n\nWhat is Apple's current market position in India?\n\nWhat tax changes did India make for Apple?\n\nWhy was Apple concerned about India's tax laws?\n\nHow will this benefit Apple's manufacturing strategy?\n\nApple had been lobbying India's government to modify its income tax laws to ensure the company is not taxed for ownership of the high-end iPhone machinery it provides to its contract manufacturers.\n\nIn India, unlike China, Apple was concerned that if it paid for machines for its contract manufacturers, Indian law could consider that a so-called \"business connection\" and impose taxes on its iPhone sales profits. ⁠That had forced its contract manufacturers Foxconn and ‌Tata to themselves spend billions of dollars on machines.\n\nIndia on Sunday said that \"to promote manufacturing of electronic goods for a contract manufacturer\", it is making certain law changes to ensure that mere ownership of ‍machines by a foreign company does not lead to taxes on it.\n\nThe decision was made public as part of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's 2026-27 annual budget, presented on Sunday.\n\nThe move could prompt Apple and other companies to invest rapidly in the electronics manufacturing space by taking over initial ​expenses for pricey machines, reducing the initial cost burden on contract manufacturers they partner with.\n\n\"We are saying that if you bring ‌your machine, and that machine is used by a local manufacturer to produce something, we will ... exempt you for 5 years. We are giving them certainty,\" Revenue Secretary Arvind Shrivastava said at a post-budget press conference.\n\nFASTER SCALE-UP AND GREATER CONFIDENCE\n\nSmartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's agenda for economic growth.\n\nThe rule change will apply until the 2030-31 tax year and only to factories set up in so-called customs-bonded areas - which are technically considered being outside India’s customs border. If devices are sold within India from ⁠such factories, they will attract import taxes, making such facilities attractive only ​for exports.\n\n\"Any income arising on account of providing capital goods, equipment or tooling ​to a contract manufacturer, being a company resident in India, is eligible for exemption,\" the Indian government said in one of its explanatory budget documents.",

    "fullText": "Tehran, Iran – Iran’s economic outlook appears increasingly grim more than three weeks after the start of what became one of the most comprehensive and prolonged state-imposed internet blackouts in history, impacting a population of more than 90 million people.\n\nIranian authorities abruptly cut off all communications across the country on the night of January 8, at the height of nationwide protests that the United Nations and international human rights organisations say were suppressed with the use of deadly force.\n\nMost of Iran’s internet bandwidth, local and international phone calls and SMS text messages have been restored over recent days. But most of the country is still unable to freely connect to the global internet amid heavy filtering by the state.\n\nThe increased bandwidth allows more people to circumvent state restrictions using a variety of proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs), but solutions are often costly and temporary.\n\nLast week, Information and Communications Technology Minister Sattar Hashemi told reporters his ministry estimates that the Iranian economy suffered at least 50 trillion rials (about $33m at the current exchange rate) in damages on a daily basis during the blackout.\n\nBut the minister admitted that the true toll is likely much higher, and said that other ministers and economic officials have privately offered heftier estimates that he did not expand upon.\n\nThe government of President Masoud Pezeshkian has said the decision to fully block connectivity was taken outside of its control by the Supreme National Security Council.\n\nPezeshkian, who had made scaling back internet filtering a main campaign promise, has refrained from talking about Iran’s largest internet blackout to date, instead focusing on economic reforms and cash subsidies.\n\nThe administration has promised to offer online businesses financial support, but the losses have already been sudden, acute, and too heavy to bear for many.\n\nSimin Siami, a travel agent working in Tehran, told Al Jazeera that her company lost most of its income and had to lay off a number of employees.\n\n“Most international flights were cancelled, and there was no way to purchase tickets or compare existing flights,” she said, adding that her company was also unable to book hotels for customers, who were initially even unable to renew their passports.\n\n“Unfortunately, that limited our services to selling tickets for local flights and booking local hotels, and cancelled all our previous international tickets and bookings.”",

    "fullText": "If Trevor Noah really wanted a response from Donald Trump on his mocking question of “What are you going to do about it?” during the Grammys on Sunday night, the former Apprentice host just gave it to him, maybe.\n\nAs he has with so many critics, those who poke fun at him and almost anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump is threatening to take Noah to court.\n\nTrevor Noah Takes Shots At Nicki Minaj, Donald Trump’s Epstein Association & More During Grammys Show\n\nTrump Celebrity Supporters: Famous Folks In Favor Of The 47th President\n\nAlex Warren Shares What He Heard During Grammy Audio Glitch: \"This Would Only Happen To Me\"\n\n“It looks like I’ll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of an M.C., and suing him for plenty,” the notoriously thin-skinned Trump posted online Sunday, not long after the Kendrick Lamar and Bad Bunny dominated the 68th annual Grammy Awards on CBS. “Ask Little George Slopadopolus, and others, how that all worked out. Also ask CBS! Get ready Noah, I’m going to have some fun with you!”\n\nProving that he loves to watch and loves to remind everyone who has already kissed the ring and written the checks, POTUS’ long, enraged and uppercase-strewn post on his Truth Social platform denounced the music industry’s big night and Noah’s last turn as Grammy host. No surprise, it was all because of a bipartisan crack by the ex-Daily Show host about that past presidential pal and deceased pedophile Epstein — as you can see here:\n\nTrevor Noah takes another jab at Donald Trump #Grammys: “Song of the Year — that is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense because Epstein’s island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out with Bill Clinton” pic.twitter.com/quUWEpX4NL\n\n— Deadline (@DEADLINE) February 2, 2026\n\nGenerating a roar from the music crowd over his swipe at Trump, Noah’s quip of “what are you going to do about it?” was born out of the reality that 2026 is going to be his final time hosting the Grammys after several years fronting the shindig.\n\nTrump didn’t give a toss about any of that.\n\n“Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island,” Trump digitally raged. “WRONG!!! I can’t speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight’s false and defamatory statement, have never been accused being there, not even by the Fake News Media.”\n\nThe remarks by Noah and the reaction by Trump comes just a couple of days after the MAGA Overlord’s Department of Justice dumped millions of redacted pages and hundreds of thousands of black-barred images from the long-delayed and much-anticipated Epstein Files. Still, with speculation that there is much more not out there despite congressional demands, Trump’s name comes up various times in what was released on January 30, including some pretty horrific allegations and new details. Among those also mentioned are L.A. Olympics boss Casey Wasserman, Elon Musk, ex-POTUS Clinton, Melania docu director Brett Ratner, Bill Gates (and some “Russian girl”), Jay-Z, the now-former Prince Andrew of Windsor, Harvey Weinstein, and of course Epstein’s right-hand lady and current federal convict Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nWhile admitting he knew Epstein back in the roaring ’80s and ’90s, Trump always has denied he got up to anything inappropriate with or via him. As accusations against the one-time openly philandering Trump have been made by alleged Epstein victims and others (as well as cringy video of Trump and Epstein and correspondence between the two), little has made it to the courts connecting him to the horrors of sex trafficking and more.\n\nSuspicion of how deep Trump really went with Epstein, who died in 2019 by what was termed suicide in police custody has become a benchmark for Democrats and others – even when the likes of Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers have also been caught in the ugly web. The massive files release of January 30 even found Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche having to insist more than once the DOJ wasn’t and hadn’t been covering up for POTUS — to almost no avail.\n\nHaving started on CBS when Trump hero Richard Nixon was in the White House in 1973, tonight was the last time the Grammys will be seen on the now David Ellison-owned network.\n\nStarting in 2027, the ceremony will be broadcast on ABC as part of the Grammys’ 10-year deal with Disney, which was announced last year. As the Oscars leave ABC for YouTube in 2029, the Grammys will air on ABC, Hulu and Disney+ from next year all the way to 2036 – when a then 90-year-old Trump will almost certainly not be president, maybe.\n\n2026 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Streaming & Cable\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office",

    "fullText": "While we’re still deep into the thick of winter, stretches of sunshine already have us snow-bound Michiganders dreaming about spring.\n\nAccuWeather has released an early peek at the spring forecast, looking at what’s ahead for each region in the country. For us in the Great Lakes, we might want to temper our excitement. Spring looks like it could be colder than normal once the calendar flips to March.\n\nMichigan is part of a group of 16 states that are expected to see a slower transition to springlike weather this year. All these states are in the Great Lakes area, Upper Midwest, Northeast and Northwest parts of the U.S.\n\n“The transition to warmer spring weather will be slower across the Northeast, Great Lakes and the Pacific Northwest this year, compared to historical averages,” AccuWeather Lead Long-Range Expert Paul Pastelok said. “Warmer springlike weather is expected to arrive early this year across much of the Southwest, from Southern California to Texas.”\n\nThis slower transition to spring is being shaped by a slower jet stream, a strong storm track expected in the South, and the fading of the La Niña weather pattern.\n\nHere are the AccuWeather highlights of the spring forecast for Michigan and the Great Lakes region:\n\nCooler start to spring with late-season snow and frost potential.\n\nSome flooding likely later from snowmelt and rain.\n\nFewer tornadoes than 2025, but frequent damaging wind events and flooding downpours.\n\nMichigan Forecast: 2 small snows and 1 big weather milestone.

    "description": "From the Datsun 240Z and BMW 2002 to the Porsche 914 and Alfa Romeo GTV, these classics offer real style, character, and driving fun without the sky-high price tags. They’re smart picks for enthusiasts who want collectibility on a budget.",
    "fullText": "The classic car market can be a puzzling place. While some vehicles command astronomical prices that seem disconnected from reality, others remain surprisingly affordable despite having all the right ingredients for collectibility.\n\nThese special gems offer genuine performance, striking looks, or fascinating backstories that should make them far more valuable than their current market prices suggest. But hey, we're not complaining!\n\nThe 240Z helped redefine the affordable sports car formula that many manufacturers still chase today. With its long hood, short deck proportions, and genuinely capable inline six engine, period road tests showed performance quick enough to worry entry-level European sports cars, at a fraction of the price.\n\nClean examples still trade for reasonable money compared to their European contemporaries, despite the Z-car's massive influence on automotive design and its role in establishing Japan as a serious player in the sports car world.\n\nAmerican Motors' answer to the Camaro and Mustang had arguably the cleanest design of any pony car from the era. The Javelin's distinctive fastback profile and well-balanced proportions put it ahead of its more popular rivals in the styling department.\n\nYet these cars remain overlooked by collectors who gravitate toward the Big Three offerings, making the Javelin one of the best bargains in the muscle car space.\n\nFew cars blend Italian passion with practical usability quite like the GTV. Its Bertone-designed coupe body wrapped around Alfa's sweet-revving twin-cam four-cylinder engine, creating a driving experience that was both spirited and refined.\n\nWhile other Italian exotics from the period command serious money, the GTV continues to fly under the radar despite offering genuine Alfa character at accessible prices.\n\nThe mid-engine 914 was ahead of its time, offering balanced handling and Porsche engineering in a package that purists initially rejected for not being a \"real\" Porsche. Decades later, the automotive world has embraced mid-engine sports cars, yet the 914 remains the affordable entry point into vintage Porsche ownership.\n\nIts unique targa top design and nimble chassis make it a joy to drive, especially the later 2.0-liter models.\n\nBefore the 3 Series became the benchmark for compact sport sedans, there was the 2002. This boxy little BMW practically created the template for European sport sedans with its rear-wheel drive layout, responsive handling, and just enough power to be entertaining.\n\nDespite its historical significance and the rabid following that modern BMW enthusiasts have developed, clean 2002s remain surprisingly attainable compared to other foundational sports cars.\n\nRally fans know the Fulvia HF for its works competition history, including helping Lancia win the 1972 International Championship for Manufacturers, but the road-going versions remain undervalued. The narrow-angle V4 engine and front-wheel drive layout created a unique character that was both sophisticated and engaging to drive.\n\nThese cars combined Italian craftsmanship with genuine performance credentials, yet they trade for a fraction of what other European sports cars from the period command.\n\nThe Europa's wedge-shaped fiberglass body wrapped around Lotus's trademark lightweight philosophy, creating one of the purest driving experiences of the era. While it required some mechanical sympathy and wasn't the most practical choice, the Europa offered a lightweight mid-engine driving experience with sharp handling, but not supercar straight-line performance.\n\nToday's values still reflect that accessibility, even though the car's innovative mid-engine design and lightweight philosophy have made it far more influential than its prices suggest.\n\nSaab's quirky sports car combined Scandinavian design sensibilities with a surprisingly capable chassis and a Ford Taunus-sourced V4 engine that Saab used widely in that era. The Sonett's distinctive styling and unconventional engineering approach made it unlike anything else on American roads during its brief production run.\n\nIts rarity and unique character should make it a collector favorite, yet these distinctive coupes remain one of the most affordable ways to own a piece of Swedish automotive history.\n\nGeneral Motors' European division created what many consider a baby Corvette with the GT's dramatic styling and pop-up headlights. The car's Coke-bottle proportions and distinctive profile turned heads everywhere, while the available 1.9-liter engine provided adequate performance for the era.\n\nDespite its connection to GM design trends of the era and a Coke bottle shape that also showed up on contemporary Corvettes, the Opel GT remains surprisingly affordable for such a visually striking car.\n\nThese nine cars represent excellent opportunities for enthusiasts who want to own a piece of automotive history without paying premium prices. Each offers something special, whether it's innovative engineering, timeless design, or cultural significance that shaped the industry. The classic car market has a way of eventually recognizing quality, so these undervalued gems might not stay affordable forever.\n\nFor now, they represent some of the best values in the collector car world for those willing to look beyond the obvious choices.",

    "description": "A newly released batch of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents, released Friday night by the U. S.",
    "fullText": "A newly released batch of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents, released Friday night by the U.S. Justice Department, quickly gained attention after social media claims suggested Russell Wilson was mentioned in connection with a potential private jet purchase. Those claims stemmed from email exchanges included in the release that referenced Wilson while discussing the possible sale of a Gulfstream G-IV aircraft owned by Epstein.\n\nHowever, Wilson forcefully rejected speculation after his name surfaced in the documents. He made it clear he had no knowledge of, or connection to, the disgraced financier. He addressed the situation directly on X as the documents began circulating.\n\n“NOPE!!! ABSOLUTELY NOT! Not TODAY satan!” Wilson wrote. “Some Random plane broker tried to sell me a plane. I had no idea whose plane and never bought the plane. Never talked nor Never met the man. Thank God!!!”\n\nThe email chain dates back to January 27, 2019, when Wilson was still the Seattle Seahawks’ quarterback and in the midst of negotiating what would later become a $140 million contract extension. The messages were exchanged between Epstein and his longtime pilot, Larry Visoski, and referenced Wilson as a potential buyer through a broker.\n\nOne message claimed Wilson had been persistently calling after seeing the aircraft and was interested in securing the jet during his contract negotiations.\n\nThe emails also outlined potential deal structures, including an option period that would have required a substantial upfront payment and varying purchase prices depending on upgrades and engine work. However, Wilson was not included in the email chains, and there is no indication that he participated directly in those conversations.\n\nAs the documents circulated, Wilson emphasized that he was never informed that the aircraft belonged to Epstein and maintained that no transaction ever took place. He stated that he never purchased the plane and never had any communication with Epstein at any point.\n\nThe release of the Epstein-related records has drawn scrutiny across multiple industries, with thousands of pages being examined for notable names and connections.\n\nIn Wilson’s case, he moved quickly to distance himself from any implication, publicly denying any association and underscoring that his only interaction involved a broker with no disclosed link to Epstein.\n\nThe post “I Had No Idea”: Russell Wilson Denies Jeffrey Epstein Files Claims Tying Him to Private Jet, $140M Deal appeared first on The SportsRush.",

According to court records, a search of Thomas's phone included sexually oriented videos and photos of Buzbee, some of which Thomas tried to delete.\n\nBuzbee, who lived in the Indianapolis suburb of Fishers and attended Hamilton Southeastern High School, was last seen by her parents on Jan. 5. She is believed to have met Thomas through an online gaming platform and voluntarily left her home to meet him. Fishers police said a vehicle in the area at the time Buzbee left her home was traced back to Thomas.\n\nFranklin County Municipal Court Judge Jim O'Grady set a $1.5 million bond for Thomas on Jan. 31, before Thomas appeared for any hearing.\n\nCourt records say Thomas was furloughed, or released temporarily, to the FBI for investigative purposes on Feb. 1 and was then returned to the Franklin County jail.\n\nThomas appeared for a bond hearing on Feb. 2 in Municipal Court. Judge Jarrod Skinner kept the $1.5 million bond in place and ordered Thomas to have no internet access or unsupervised visits with minors should he post that and be released, court records say.\n\nOfficials spoke with Thomas within a few days of Buzbee's disappearance. Thomas reportedly told detectives he had dropped Buzbee off on the side of the road in western Ohio, but an investigation determined that was not true.\n\nBuzbee was initially classified as a runaway, but her case was upgraded to an \"endangered missing juvenile\" on Jan. 20.\n\nPolice searched Thomas' vehicle and home on Jan. 21 and found evidence Buzbee had been there, as well as at a short-term rental in Hocking County. Thomas has not been charged with murder, according to court records in Franklin and Perry counties.\n\nReporter Bethany Bruner can be reached at bbruner@dispatch.com.\n\nContact Jake Allen at jake.allen@indystar.com.

    "fullText": "The father of a 5-year-old boy who was detained by immigration officers and held at an federal facility in Texas denied government accounts Monday that he abandoned his son as the pair returned to Minnesota.\n\nAdrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecudador, told ABC News that he loves his son, Liam, and would never abandon him, disputing statements from the Department of Homeland Security, which alleged that Arias had left his child in a vehicle. He also said his son got sick while in federal custody but was denied medicine.\n\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Arias fled on foot before he was arrested, “abandoning his child.” She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stayed with the boy.\n\n“The facts in this case have NOT changed: The father who was illegally in the country chose to take his child with him to a detention center,\" she said.\n\nMcLaughlin did not address Arias' statement that his son was denied medication while in custody.\n\nArias also said he was arrested unjustly and contended he was in the country legally, with a pending court hearing for asylum.\n\nThe comments come after a federal judge ordered over the weekend that the pair be freed. They were released Sunday and returned to Minnesota, according to Rep. Joaquin Castro of Texas.\n\nThe family's arrest and release unfolded during President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration, which has led to daily protests that included the shooting deaths of two American citizens by federal officers. The president last week ordered his top border adviser to oversee the crackdown days after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan suggested that mistakes have been made, but he said agents would continue to enforce federal law and called on local and state officials to cooperate with federal officers.\n\nThe boy's detention drew outrage as images of immigration officers surrounding the young boy in a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack began to surface.\n\nMcLaughlin said ICE did not target or arrest the boy, and she repeated assertions that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.\n\nMcLaughlin also said last month that the child was abandoned and that officers tried to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken into custody.”\n\nNeighbors and school officials said federal officers used the child as “bait,” telling him to knock on his house’s door so his mother would come out. DHS disputed that description.\n\nMarcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father.\n\nThe government said the boy’s father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has a pending asylum claim that allows him to stay in the U.S.\n\nThe vast majority of asylum-seekers are released in the United States, with adults having eligibility for work permits, while their cases wind through a backlogged court system.\n\nEcuadorians, who left in droves in recent years as their country spiraled into violence, have fared poorly in immigration court, with judges granting asylum in 12.5% of decisions in the 12-month period through September, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering and research organization based at Syracuse University.\n\nIn ordering the release of Liam and his father, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing that the case had “its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”\n\nThe Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online court docket shows no future hearings for Liam’s father.",

    "fullText": "ROME (AP) — Tourists hoping to get close to the Trevi Fountain had to pay 2 euros ($2.35) starting Monday as the city of Rome inaugurated a new fee structure to help raise money and control crowds at the one of the world’s most celebrated waterworks.\n\nThe first tourists to pass through the new ticket check seemed nonplussed by the tariff, noting it was a small price to pay for quality access to a fountain made famous by Federico Fellini’s movie “La Dolce Vita.”\n\n“Before, there were problems accessing the fountain. There were a lot of people. Now, it’s very easy,” said Ilhan Musbah, a tourist from Morocco. “You can take photos, you feel good, you’re comfortable, and on top of that 2 euros is not much.”\n\nThe tourist fee was rolled out in conjunction with a new 5-euro (nearly $6) tourist ticket fee for some city museums. In both cases, Rome residents are exempt from the fees and the extra revenue will actually expand the number of city-run museums that are free for registered Roman residents.\n\nIt's all part of the Eternal City’s efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome’s cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city 6.5 million euros ($7.6 million) extra a year.\n\nThe city decided to impose the Trevi Fountain fee after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front edge of the basin by imposing lines and pathways for entrance and exit.\n\n“I think tourists were shocked by the fact that the city of Rome is only asking for 2 euros for a site of this level,” Alessandro Onorato, Rome’s assessor of tourism, said Monday. “I believe that if the Trevi Fountain were in New York, they would have charged at least $100.”\n\nThe fee follows a similar ticketing system at Rome’s Pantheon monument and the more complicated tourist day-tripper tax that the lagoon city of Venice imposed last year in a bid to ease overtourism and make the city more livable for residents. The Italian fees still pale in comparison to the 45% price hike that French authorities announced for the Louvre Museum for most non-European visitors, where tickets can now run to 32 euros ($37) from 22 euros.\n\nThe Trevi fee, which can be paid in advance online, enables tourists to get close to the fountain during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free, as it is up close after hours.\n\nThe towering fountain features the Titan god Oceanus flanked by falls cascading down the travertine rocks into a shallow turquoise pool, where Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg famously took their nighttime dip in “La Dolce Vita.”\n\nWhile bathing is prohibited nowadays, legend has it that visitors who toss a coin over their shoulders and make a wish will return to Rome.",

    "fullText": "Formula 1 2026 world championship favourite George Russell is confident Mercedes has produced a strong car for the upcoming season - but refused to declare it a potential title contender.\n\nThis year, F1 will introduce a whole new set of regulations with changes to both the chassis and power unit and as everything is new, the pecking order is currently a guessing game.\n\nBut expectations are high at Mercedes, considering the Silver Arrows dominated the last engine switch in 2014 by winning the next eight championships, while it also enjoyed a strong Barcelona shakedown last week.\n\nIt completed the most mileage of any team and Russell’s team-mate Andrea Kimi Antonelli even conducted a full race simulation, causing engineering director Andrew Shovlin to claim “I don’t think we could have hoped for a better three days of testing”.\n\nThis has led to Russell topping the odds for this year’s title, especially after his strongest season yet in 2025 with fourth in the standings and to many, being the best driver behind Max Verstappen.\n\nBut he is still wary of his rivals with two official Bahrain tests to come before the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on 6-8 March.\n\n“Obviously we've only driven the car for three days and it's still very early days, but it doesn't look like it's a turd, which is a bonus,” said the five-time grand prix winner at the Mercedes 2026 launch on Monday.\n\n“To be honest, in the early days like this, you know when it could be a really bad car and you can highlight those negatives early on, we don't believe it is. But is it a car that can produce a world championship? It's still way too early to see.\n\n“We've been quite surprised by what we've seen from some of our rivals, especially on the Red Bull power unit side, that looks very impressive considering they're a completely new outfit and reliable as well.\n\n“So kudos to them. We've had a very reliable test, but we'll have to wait and see if the car lives up to the expectation.”\n\nThe situation marks a far cry from 2022 when ground-effect cars were introduced for Russell’s debut season at Mercedes, whose dominance was ended with the last rule switch.\n\nFour years ago, the German marque produced a very unpredictable car that endured vast porpoising and this made it hard for Mercedes to recover, as the subsequent titles went to Red Bull or McLaren.\n\nBut now, Russell believes Mercedes has built a nice, drivable car as he said: “Nobody expected porpoising in ‘22. So you can’t discount everything right now. But that's why I think we left Barcelona with a positive feeling because the car reacted as we anticipated.\n\n“The numbers we're seeing from the aero on the car match what we see back on the simulator, how the car is handling is matching how it feels on the simulator. So this is something we've not really experienced since 2021 as a team.\n\n“So we're sort of ticking the boxes of everything that we want to tick. But we can't discount our rivals because, as I said, there was a lot of talk around the Red Bull power unit not being up to standard year one - from what we've seen so far, they've definitely delivered.\n\n“Ferrari power unit looks reliable. They did lots of laps not far behind us over the course of a test and from a power unit side, Haas did loads of laps as well with the Ferrari engine. So the truth is that there could be a good fight on our hands, but we're satisfied with what we've experienced.”\n\nAlthough the 27-year-old is still somewhat playing down expectations ahead of the campaign, Russell does have the confidence of a driver who can finally take his maiden F1 crown.\n\nWhen the title favourite tag was put to the Briton, he said: “I didn't really feel anything from hearing that, to be honest.\n\n“As I've said for a long time, I feel ready to fight for a world championship and whether we have that comment above us or not, that does not change my approach one single bit.\n\n“I'm working so hard with the team. Everybody here has been working flat out to really maximise this new set of regulations and I'm honestly just so excited by the challenge because it is a huge challenge adapting to these new cars, how the energy management works, the re-harvesting of the batteries, getting your head around the boost system, the overtake modes, the active aero.\n\n“There's a lot of things we need to learn very quickly, but I feel I can take advantage from that and I feel confident with myself and my team.”\n\nThe challenges facing Mercedes ahead of F1 2026\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "title": "‘He Was A Steal For Us’: Maple Leafs Trading Of Prospect Fraser Minten To Boston Not Aging Well",
    "description": "As the Maple Leafs risk missing the postseason for the first time in a decade, the immediate success of Fraser Minten in Boston is turning the Brandon Carlo trade into the latest chapter in a long history of lopsided deals between the two rivals.",
    "fullText": "It’s been less than a year since the Toronto Maple Leafs shipped Fraser Minten, along with a top-five protected first-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft, to Boston for veteran defenseman Brandon Carlo. While the Leafs certainly needed a player like Carlo, a right-handed shutdown defenseman who could play alongside Morgan Rielly, few would have predicted that Toronto would find themselves on the short end of the deal so quickly.\n\nWith the Leafs appearing bound to miss the playoffs for the first time in ten years, Minten has excelled with his new team. He was named the NHL’s Rookie of the Month for January after scoring eight goals and adding six assists in 14 games. Recently, he was promoted to the club’s first line to play alongside Morgan Geekie and David Pastrnak before moving back to the second-line center position.\n\n“He was a steal for us,” Bruins head coach Marco Sturm said regarding the acquisition. Perhaps more impressive is that all eight of Minten’s goals came at even strength, as he was not slated to receive significant power-play time.\n\nFraser Minten of the @NHLBruins, who topped all rookies with 8-6—14 and a +12 rating in 14 games, has been named the NHL’s “Rookie of the Month” for January.#NHLStats: https://t.co/idkVX4OOtV pic.twitter.com/HbZNsruplR\n\n— NHL Public Relations (@NHLPR) February 1, 2026\n\n“I’m very, very happy with the way he’s been playing all year long,” Sturm added. “I put him in different situations from the fourth line to pretty much the first line, and you could see he can do it all. He definitely has something a lot of players don’t have”.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlo has missed 23 games this season due to an ankle injury that required a corrective procedure. While injuries have contributed to Toronto’s struggles, handing Boston a high first-round pick is a tough pill to swallow—unless, of course, that pick remains in the top five.\n\nMarco Sturm on Fraser Minten: \"[He] was a steal for us.\"\n\nEveryone say #ThankYouToronto 🤭 pic.twitter.com/VlnzsxRTsk\n\n— NESN (@NESN) January 30, 2026\n\nAs Minten thrives, the trade is shaping up to be another lopsided Toronto-Boston transaction. History offers a grim reminder: in 2006, the Leafs traded goaltending prospect Tuukka Rask for Andrew Raycroft. Rask became a franchise icon, winning a Vezina Trophy and serving as a backup for the 2011 Stanley Cup-winning team before making two more Final appearances as a starter. He retired as the winningest netminder in Bruins history. Raycroft, by contrast, spent only two seasons in Toronto with mediocre results, despite a 37-win debut season.\n\nThe #OverDrive crew look back on the Brandon Carlo/Fraser Minten trade.\n\nDo you think the Leafs lost that trade, in hindsight? 👀@OverDrive1050 pic.twitter.com/2PnkR7DNgn\n\n— TSN (@TSN_Sports) January 30, 2026\n\nSimilarly, in 2009, the Leafs acquired Phil Kessel from the Bruins. While Kessel led the Leafs in scoring for six seasons, the acquisition cost Toronto two first-round picks and a second-round pick. Those first-rounders became Tyler Seguin (2nd overall) and Dougie Hamilton (9th overall)—both high-end talents who have enjoyed long, successful careers.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe January transfer window allows clubs across Europe to add mid-season reinforcements and make alterations as a reaction to their current positioning and squad health.\n\nSome clubs may wish to add players due to injuries, poor performance, or a strong first half of the campaign, which has positioned them to achieve more than they expected.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, may wish to move on from disgruntled players or get some cash for those who are slated to leave in the summer for free.\n\nThe Sporting News brings you a roundup of when the transfer window opens and closes across the major European leagues, who have come together in recent years to align their calendars with one another for a more streamlined process.\n\nMORE:Updated list of Premier League top goal scorers for 2025/26 season\n\nThe 2026 January transfer window closes for Premier League clubs onp.m. GMT (2 p.m. ET).\n\nThis is because the traditional closing date, January 31, falls on a Saturday, and as such it will close on the following Monday.\n\nLike the open date, the closing date is also matched for all of the major European leagues, meaning England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France's top flights all have the same closing date.\n\nThe only slight quirk is the time of day the window closes on. Serie A, Ligue 1, and the Bundesliga have synced with the Premier League perfectly, also closing at 7 p.m. GMT / 8 p.m. CET. However, the transfer window in Spain closes at 11:59 p.m. CET.\n\nThe January transfer window is a month-long period during which clubs can make changes to their roster.\n\nTechnically, a \"transfer window\" is actually a registration period, during which teams can register new players and make general changes to their league-official squad.\n\nPlayers acquired outside a transfer window cannot be registered until the new window opens.\n\nAdditionally, starting January 1, players who are out of contract in the summer are allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with a new club, under certain circumstances (e.g. Premier League players can sign for a foreign team). They are still contracted to their current club through the end of the season, but they are able to sign agreements with a new team to take effect at the expiration of their current deal.\n\nMORE:Breaking down the intricacies of the handball rule in soccer",

    "title": "Toto Wolff slams F1 rivals amid 2026 engine row: ‘They want to find excuses’",
    "description": "An engine controversy, with Ferrari, Audi and Honda complaining to the FIA over a ‘loophole’ Mercedes and Red Bull have found, was sharply dismissed by the Mercedes F1 CEO on Monday",
    "fullText": "Toto Wolff has slammed Mercedes’ F1 rivals over the sport’s engine controversy ahead of the 2026 season, sharply telling them to “get their s*** together.”\n\nIn one of the sport’s biggest-ever rule changes, new engine and chassis regulations are being introduced this year, with Mercedes the frontrunners after last week’s first pre-season test in Barcelona. However, a divide between the five engine manufacturers has already emerged over the off-season.\n\nFerrari, Audi and Honda have complained to the FIA (F1’s governing body) about Mercedes and Red Bull finding an engine “loophole”. The matter in question concerns the compression ratio of the internal combustion engine, specifically the ratio between the cylinder’s maximum and minimum volume. The rules mandate a 16:1 ratio, measured at an “ambient temperature” while the car is stationary, but Mercedes and Red Bull are believed to be exploiting thermal expansion, which would lead the compression ratio to be closer to the old 18:1 regulation while running on track.\n\nSuch an advantage could help teams by up to 0.3 seconds per lap and, as such, the other three engine manufacturers have written to the FIA insisting a ratio higher than the 16:1 figure mandated would be against the rules. Further meetings with the FIA on the matter are expected in the coming weeks.\n\nYet Mercedes team principal Wolff, speaking after the team’s 2026 car launch on Monday, criticised the outrage amongst other teams: “I just don’t understand that some teams concentrate more on others and keep arguing a case that is very clear and transparent.\n\n“Communication with the FIA was very positive all along, not only on compression ratio but other things too. Specifically in that area, it’s very clear what the regulations say, what the standard procedures are.\n\n“So just get your s*** together. Doing secret meetings and letters, and inventing ways of testing which don’t exist… I can just say at least from us, we’re trying to minimise distractions and that’s looking more at us, not everybody else.”\n\nRed Bull engine boss Ben Hodgkinson, formerly of Mercedes, also insisted he could not comprehend why a row has broken out – a viewpoint Wolff also threw his weight behind, with just five weeks until the season-opening race in Australia on 8 March.\n\n“It’s pretty clear what the regulations say,” he added. “Maybe we’re all different, maybe you want to find excuses before you’ve even started.\n\n“Everybody needs to do it to the best of their ability, but that’s not how we do things, especially if you’ve been told a few times it’s fine. It’s legal and what the regulations say. If someone wants to entertain themselves by distraction, they’re free to do that.”\n\nGiven Mercedes’s impressive execution in the last engine regulation change in 2014, leading to eight consecutive constructors’ titles, the Silver Arrows are thought to be at the front of the pecking order ahead of two more pre-season tests in Bahrain later this month.\n\nGeorge Russell is the early title favourite for the drivers’ championship, ahead of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.c“It’s always nice if your driver is the favourite,” Wolff added.\n\n“He [George] deserves it because he’s one of the best. He’s been overall more than great for us, but it’s the best driver and best car that wins.\n\n“We haven’t yet proven that there is a package which is good enough. I’d hope the bookmakers are right, but I’ll believe it when we have seen performances that have confirmed that.”\n\nThe next pre-season test is in Bahrain on 11-13 February.",

Tied with Tennessee and Kentucky, here are the SEC teams with more than one Quad 1A win.\n\nOver the next four games against Alabama (road), Florida (home), Missouri (road), and Vanderbilt (road), Texas A&M will have three Quad 1A opportunities, and winning one, or two of these tough matchups would likely guarentee the Aggies an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament, especially given the fact that McMillan's squad is a perfect 12-0 in Quad 3 and Quad 3 games.\n\nAfter Florida blew out Alabama 100-77 on Sunday night, Texas A&M has a chance to take advantage of the Crimson Tide's short turnaround before playing on Wednesday, but needs to play with the same mentality, and shoot at least 45% from the field, and hit free throws to have a chance at pulling off the upset.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M basketball's three Quad 1A wins tied for most in the SEC",

The former Real Madrid striker is expected to leave the Jeddah-based SPL club over a disagreement regarding Al-Ittihad’s contractual renewal offer.\n\nIlenikhena joined AS Monaco 18 months ago from Royal Antwerp in a reported €17m transfer fee, which is nearly half of Al-Ittihad’s proposal despite Ilenikhena scoring only ten goals in 51 games with the Principality club.",

    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are coming off a dismal season that led to a massive overhaul of the organization. Gone is Brian Callahan, and most of his staff, and the Titans have a new head coach in Robert Saleh. But that doesn’t mean that Tennessee didn't have some highlights.\n\nOne of those that marked Callahan’s last victory as Titans’ head coach, and much like the majority of his tenure, it was a fluke. Incredibly, this victory over the Arizona Cardinals was so improbable that it landed on CBS Sports' top 25 stories of the 2025 season.\n\n22. Tennessee Titans at Arizona Cardinals, Week 5: Cardinals, Jonathan Gannon, Kyler Murray, Emari Demercado collapse\n\nThis one requires us to go back quite a bit, but the butterfly effect is startling. The Cardinals, up 21-3 at home against the then-winless Tennessee Titans, suffered one of the wildest and most inexcusable collapses in recent memory en route to a 22-21 defeat.\n\nAlthough the Cardinals basically handed the Titans the victory, Tennessee looked competitive in the fourth quarter and made the plays necessary for the win, with Cam Ward making some big-time throws to give them a chance.\n\nThe Titans would go on to fire Callahan a couple of weeks later, with the win being the highlight of his final weeks in Nashville. But for that week, the football gods looked down on the Titans and gave them a memorable moment in the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Titans improbable victory over Cardinals one of the top stories in 2025",

    "fullText": "Notre Dame football had a big hole to fill when defensive backs coach Mike Mickens decided to leave for the NFL, but head coach Marcus Freeman filled the role on Sunday afternoon.\n\nAaron Henry, the now former defensive coordinator for Illinois will join the Irish according Matt Zenitz of CBS Sports. Like he has done in the past, Freeman made a fantastic hire, one where Henry will coach defensive backs along with being the co-defensive coordinator with Chris Ash.\n\nLike social media always does, there were plenty of positive Notre Dame reactions to this hire. Find out below some of the best social media post about the news of the Irish hiring Henry.\n\nMan that is an enormous move from Notre Dame. Henry is a rising star and getting him to take a functional demotion is a sign of how much cache the Irish have right now. https://t.co/hDoDq5cAoS\n\n— Dylan Sinn (@DylanSinn) February 1, 2026\n\nThere aren’t many programs around the country where a defensive coordinator would take a “demotion” to join a team, but that’s what happened here. Notre Dame has plenty of clout in the coaching world right now.\n\nAccording to a source, Notre Dame is expected to Aaron Henry as its new defensive backs coach, replacing Mike Mickens. Henry was defensive coordinator at Illinois the past three seasons.\n\nHenry coached defensive backs for Chris Ash at Rutgers in 2016.\n\n— Pete Sampson (@PeteSampson_) February 1, 2026\n\nRelationships matter, and with the hiring of Henry, he’s be reunited with his former boss, Ash. The familiarity between the two will go a long way towards the transition of the defensive side of the ball.\n\nMissed this a bit earlier. Marcus Freeman with a statement hire. https://t.co/zwyBwxDGje\n\n— Greg Smith (@GregSmithRivals) February 1, 2026\n\nWhile the multiple defensive coaching changes could have doomed the Irish, it doesn’t look like that will be the case. Freeman has done it again, as Notre Dame shouldn’t miss a beat with Henry coaching the secondary.\n\nA big hire for Notre Dame.\n\nThere were multiple NFL teams that had interest in Henry this cycle, including the Jacksonville Jaguars (whom he interviewed with), before he ultimately decided to accept this job with the Fighting Irish.https://t.co/4GOwOvHqCZ https://t.co/ZoeA3WQ8JJ\n\n— Matt Zenitz (@mzenitz) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s hard to turn down the NFL, but that’s exactly what Henry did with this move. He’ll still be a wanted man in the coming seasons, but for right now, he’s with Notre Dame.\n\nMarcus Freeman is just flat out one of the best in college football at surrounding himself with an elite staff \n\nEvery time Notre Dame loses a stud coach from their staff, Freeman makes an A+ hire to replace them https://t.co/PPp2bLe7JZ\n\n— Always Talkin’ Ball Podcast (@AlwaysTalkBall) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s pretty clear how you win at the college level now, having an older roster and an elite coaching staff, which it very much looks like Notre Dame will have this coming season. The expectations won’t be changed with Henry’s impending hire, win the College Football Playoff.\n\nOh and Aaron Henry coached Kerby Joseph into an All-Big Ten player Illinois after one season as a full time safety.\n\nJoseph was All-Pro for the Detroit Lions after leading the league in INTs (9) in 2024. \n\nElite resume for Aaron Henry while at Illinois. https://t.co/OWzjWxqrX3\n\n— Notre Dame Recruiting (@NDrecruiting01) February 1, 2026\n\nIt’s one thing to send a 5-star or high 4-stars to the NFL, its entirely another to take lower ranked recruits and turn them into NFL draft picks, which is exactly what Henry has done. Imagine what he’s going to do with top-level players, it’s’ going to be impressive.\n\nNotre Dame is expected to hire Illinois @AaronHenry7 as it's next DB Coach.\n\nHere he is Mic'd up so you can get a feel. \n\nPlaces he's coached:\nFIU, Arkansas, Rutgers, NC State, Vanderbilt, Baylor, Illinois. \n\nIn 2022 he created the #1 scoring defense at Illinois. Without elite… pic.twitter.com/c7egECSEjG\n\n— CathVSConf☘️ (@CathVSConf) February 1, 2026\n\nJust a few years ago, Henry coached the top scoring defense in the country. There is no doubt in my mind that he can get Notre Dame close to that level too.\n\nThis is a chess move. Ash is probably gone after next year and Marcus can just remove the co- tag https://t.co/ljViGNwhBQ\n\n— Brendan (@verypiratey) February 1, 2026\n\nWith what Ash did last fall, and what he’s expected to do this season, there could be multiple teams looking to poach him from South Bend after the year ends. It would be a smooth transition to make Henry the full-time defensive coordinator if Ash does move on.\n\nI’m sorry, did we just pull a Defensive Coordinator from the B1G to be our DBs coach? 👀 https://t.co/Pgp55I7l2r\n\n— The 4 Horsemen Podcast (@HorsemenPod) February 1, 2026\n\nHenry will be more than just a defensive backs coach, but it’s still very impressive that Notre Dame pulled off this feat. Call it the Freeman-effect, as coaches see that he’s a superstar in the making.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Social reactions to Notre Dame expected to hire Aaron Henry as co-DC",

    "fullText": "Who is going to be the Washington Commanders' starting middle linebacker in 2026?\n\nRising third-year linebacker Jordan Magee, from Temple University, was interviewed very briefly recently by Ben Standig, and Standig played the interview this past week on his podcast.\n\nWSH LB Jordan Magee in space vs. Achane#RaiseHail pic.twitter.com/HD3cmf6Itw\n\n— Last of the Fullbacks (@TheLastFullback) November 19, 2025\n\nWhere Jordan Magee started only one game in 2024, he showed improvement and was more healthy, starting eight games in 2025. Where in 2024 Magee was in on nine tackles, this past season, he was in on 54 tackles, three of which were for a loss. \"I thought there was a lot of growth for me as a player,\" expressed Magee. \"As I got out on the field more, I got more comfortable.\"\n\nGoing from his first year to his second, can be a time where your knowledge has increased, one can be much more relaxed, not tight mentally in games. Consequently, not pressing to think, one finds they can react much more freely and quickly. \"I wanted to work on getting off of blocks better. Working on my tackling, my tracking ability. For me, I want to play lower, for better leverage. So I work on my knee bend, trying to stay low while moving.\"\n\nBobby Wagner has been a great teacher and teammate. Wagner is known to be quite the leader in the classroom, in the film room, and on the field. Wagner reached a milestone the final game of the 2025 season when he recorded his career tackle No. 2000. The Commanders have a major decision to make regarding Wagner. He was clearly still a great run defender in between the tackles, but has lost a step or two in going sideline to sideline and in pass coverage.\n\nBut for Magee, it is still all about respect for Wagner on and off the football field. \"I appreciate him for everything that he has helped me with. I will probably go to his graduation in May (MBA from Howard U). You always got to show love and gratitude to somebody who accomplished that type of thing.\"\n\nAs for this 2026 offseason, what are the plans for Magee? Well, he will certainly be lifting and working out. He wants to keep his job in the NFL, entering his third season with the Commanders. But he also has a special trip that he wants to make this offseason.\n\nMagee said he wanted to go to Tokyo last year, but an injury needed rehab, so he did the work instead. He said he and his girlfriend plan to go this offseason to see what life and the culture are like in a major city in Japan.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Can Jordan Magee replace Bobby Wagner?",

    "fullText": "The transfer window closes tonight at 7pm after over a month of business across the Premier League.\n\nHowever, fans hoping to see late activity in the market at their clubs can keep the faith beyond 7pm.\n\nClubs are still allowed to strike deals after that time, provided they meet a specific rule that grants them a two-hour extension to finalise signings.\n\nA deal sheet is effectively a way for clubs to tell the Premier League that a transfer has been agreed – but they just need a bit more time to finalise the official documents.\n\nPremier League clubs can only use a deal sheet after 5pm, and it must be submitted before 7pm.\n\nIf all the relevant details are filled in, the Premier League grant an extra two hours for the deal to be completed.\n\nYou can see an example of a deal sheet below.\n\nArsenal signed Raheem Sterling using a deal sheet in summer 2024 – and once all media duties had been carried out, the Gunners ended up announcing the signing around 2am.\n\nHowever, this is only applicable to domestic transfers, and clubs must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight if they want to complete an international signing from abroad.\n\nThe Premier League describe the FIFA Transfer Matching System as follows.\n\n“When there is an international transfer, the buying and selling clubs have to register it on FIFA’s Transfer Matching System (TMS) in order for international clearance to be generated.\n\n“The buying club have to upload all the information to the system and the foreign club have to match all the details.\n\n“Our FA will request clearance and, as long as everything matches, the foreign association will issue clearance to the FA, who then informs the club and League.”\n\nIn years gone by, those in the English Football League (EFL) – meaning Championship, League One and League Two clubs – have also been allowed to submit a deal sheet for late transfers.\n\nHowever, the EFL have now put a stop to it.\n\nAn official statement reads: “In the EFL, all documentation must be provided prior to the deadline closing for the registration of a player to go through.”\n\nThere is – however – the presence of a ‘quick application’ which gives EFL clubs an extra 15 minutes to finalise transfers.\n\nIt is said: “If a club is in a Full Application at 10:30pm, they will receive a warning that states the system will open a Quick Application at 10:45pm, where only certain fields need to be completed.\n\n“In those last 15 minutes of the Transfer Window, EFL systems allow clubs to submit the necessary registration form without completing the full application process. Where they do this, the clubs then have a further 15 minutes to complete the full application process. This avoids clubs missing the deadline in circumstances where they have agreed and signed all necessary documents with another club and the player before 11pm, but still need time to complete the full application.”",

While the Centennial State is not known for being a football powerhouse, there are diamonds in the rough each year.\n\nOne of those diamonds is class of 2028 quarterback Titus Huard, son of former University of Washington and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Brock Huard. The Buffs made an offer to Huard on Sunday, joining several schools that had recently offered the quarterback.\n\nThe younger Huard plays for former Colorado interim head coach Mike Sanford at Valor Christian High School in Littleton, Colorado, where his father is also the tight ends coach.\n\nHuard has yet to be ranked by any recruiting outlet, but his 14 offers as a sophomore make him an already hot commodity on the recruiting trail. He holds offers from Washington, Texas Tech, Oregon, Colorado State, Kansas State, Arkansas and others.\n\nAfter a great talk with @CoachHouli I’m extremely honored to recieve an offer from @CUBuffsFootball!! #skobuffs @Coach_Sanford2 @GoValorFootball @kngdmsp @BrandonHuffman @adamgorney @TommyVento16 @DeionSanders pic.twitter.com/Vn7mc7kiUu\n\n— Titus Huard (@Titushuard7) February 1, 2026\n\nAt 6-foot-5, 205 pounds, Huard is a prototypical size for a quarterback, but also a starting pitcher. Huard advertises himself on social media as a quarterback, pitcher and power forward. He clearly has the quarterback position down, but it will be interesting to watch how his final two years of high school unfold regarding his other sporting interests.\n\nHuard is coming off a sophomore season where he completed 127 of 184 passes for 1,946 yards and 16 touchdowns. His team reached the 5A state semifinals.\n\nA commitment from Huard would be significant for Sanders and CU, given the in-state and coaching connections, as well as the prestige of the schools currently involved.\n\nFollow Charlie Strella on X, Threads and Instagram.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Colorado football recruiting QB Titus Huard offer",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings turned the page Friday on the Kwesi Adofo-Mensah era, firing the general manager after four seasons and promoting Vice President of Football Operations Rob Brzezinski to the interim GM role. Since Adofo-Mensah’s termination, several theories have swirled about why he got the boot, but one, above all else, takes the case: he drafted terribly.\n\nDraft misses piled up, the roster aged fast, and Minnesota chose a reset at GM.\n\nOf course, the Wilfs’ (Vikings ownership) decision considered all moving parts, but the fact remains Adofo-Mensah would still be employed if he drafted at an average or better success rate.\n\nMinnesota begins life without Adofo-Mensah for the first time in four years.\n\nSome have already pointed to Adofo-Mensah’s paternity leave, which lasted two weeks, as the smoking gun or Adofo-Mensah’s inability to re-sign Sam Darnold or Daniel Jones in the 2025 offseason.\n\nBut when it gets down to brass tacks, Adofo-Mensah did not replenish the roster with enough talent through the draft. Each draft has seven picks per team, and through 28 eligible throws at the dartboard, Adofo-Mensah brought home Donovan Jackson, Dallas Turner, Will Reichard, Levi Drake Rodriguez, Jordan Addison, and Jalen Nailor. That’s about it.\n\nHis success rate in the draft landed at 20% if the tabulator is feeling generous. The draft is, of course, a crapshoot, but that means a general manager should not expect to hit 100% of the time. That doesn’t give him a license to strike out 80% of the time.\n\nThat’s what happened with Adofo-Mensah. Approximately four-fifths of his picks flamed out. It made Minnesota’s current roster old compared to other NFL teams. And that’s a problem for an organization that wishes to keep the Super Bowl window open at all times.\n\nCompared to Other NFL Franchises\n\nHere’s the horribly dooming stat —\n\nMost Games Started per Player by Team,\nPlayers Drafted by THAT Team,\nSince 2022:\n\nOnly the Dolphins did it more poorly, and that squad also fired its general manager a couple of months ago. The NFL draft is the only place in football to get players for free, and Minnesota whiffed more often than not under Adofo-Mensah.\n\nJ.J. McCarthy Alone Might Have Saved Adofo-Mensah\n\nTo be clear: the largest indictment, at least right now, is McCarthy not panning through two seasons. Had McCarthy thrived in 2025, as many expected, Adofo-Mensah would actually be championed right now. For Adofo-Mensah, his spotty draft resume could be reversed if he just hit on McCarthy.\n\nSo far, McCarthy has not produced, missing 70% of all Vikings games due to injury.\n\nIf McCarthy turns into a franchise quarterback with the Vikings or another team, Adofo-Mensah will have an “I told you so” argument. But that just doesn’t matter during the 2026 offseason because Minnesota must decide to keep him as the QB1 or acquire a different passer.\n\nAll signs point to the latter with Adofo-Mensah removed from his position.\n\nCBS Sports‘ Robby Kalland wrote last weekend, “A new regime in Minnesota could mean changes at quarterback sooner rather than later. We’ll find out exactly how much belief coach Kevin O’Connell has in McCarthy, as Adofo-Mensah was clearly a strong believer in the young quarterback. A new GM, however, won’t have the same ties to him.”\n\n“As such, one of the first major evaluations for whoever steps into the general manager role will be whether they view McCarthy as the franchise quarterback of the future. Given the Vikings’ cap situation, it wouldn’t be surprising if McCarthy gets another year to show what he can do. Minnesota likely won’t be in the market for a high-priced free agent, and this year’s draft class isn’t highly regarded beyond Fernando Mendoza, who is the favorite to go No. 1 to the Raiders.”\n\nThankfully, Vikings fans can dream big again. They don’t have to dread the draft, an event that was guaranteed to result in underwhelming results over the last four years.\n\nPound-for-pound, the current roster is one of the NFL’s oldest. The only way to fix that is competent drafting in the next few years. Drafting rookies who play and remain on the roster for four years or more will go a long way toward changing the dynamic of an old roster.\n\nMinnesota went all-in last year after completing its competitive rebuild plan, and with that strategy in full motion, the roster should be one of the league’s youngest — not oldest.\n\nAdofo-Mensah forced himself to use free agency as a replenishing mechanism for his sad draft tendencies. The next guy or group will use the draft foremost to find talent, with free agency as the cake topper. It’s the only sustainable way to contend for a Super Bowl.",

    "fullText": "The New York Giants face a critical wide receiver need heading into the offseason, as highlighted in Pro Football Focus' analysis of teams' biggest priorities for free agency and the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nPFF believes the Giants should focus on adding a receiver at No. 5 overall. Specifically, Ohio State wideout Carnell Tate.\n\nBiggest Need: Wide receiver Target: WR Carnell Tate, Ohio State\n\nMalik Nabers flashed star potential as a rookie in 2024, ranking eighth out of 133 qualifying wide receivers in PFF overall grade (86.7). He appeared in just four games this season before suffering a torn ACL, so we didn’t get an opportunity to see how he would develop with quarterback Jaxson Dart.\n\nBeyond Nabers, the Giants' wide receiver unit looks thin, especially since slot specialist Wan'Dale Robinson is heading into free agency and may not be back with the team. Sometimes overshadowed by Jeremiah Smith at Ohio State, Tate is a polished prospect in his own right after finishing fifth in the FBS with an 89.0 PFF receiving grade. He also did not drop a single pass across 66 targets this season.\n\nNabers' injury-shortened 2025 campaign underscores the urgency for depth and a reliable complement.\n\nTate, a 6-foot-3 OSU standout, offers elite reliability -- boasting a near-perfect drop rate and strong efficiency even while sharing targets with top talents. His high PFF grades and production (875 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025 despite missing time) position him as a potential top-10 pick, frequently mocked to the Giants at No. 5.\n\nTargeting Tate makes strategic sense to bolster Jaxson Dart's options and build around Nabers long-term. While the draft class is deep, passing on a polished, high-upside receiver like Tate could prolong the Giants' offensive struggles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Should New York Giants target WR Carnell Tate?",

    "fullText": "Matchday 20 in the Bundesliga saw Bayern Munich drop more points, Borussia Dortmund close the gap, Mainz 05 stun Leipzig, a head coach dismissal, and much more. Here is everything you need to know from matchday 20 in the Bundesliga.\n\nFor the second week in a row, Bayern Munich failed to win a Bundesliga game. Vincent Kompany’s side were held to a hard-fought 2-2 draw against Hamburger SV in the Volksparstadion on Saturday evening.\n\nIt was a gutsy performance from HSV, who, if they stay up, will have their displays at home to thank. 16 of their 19 points in the league this season have all come from home, and perhaps this was the most satisfying of the lot.\n\nHamburg’s pressure was then rewarded when a Kimmich follow-up on Nicolai Remberg resulted in a penalty, which Fabio Vieria converted to make 1-0. However, just before half-time, Harry Kane would equalise for Bayern with a swivelling shot.\n\nJust after half-time, substitute Luis Diaz scored to make it 2-1, but the game would continue to follow a similar pattern to the first half, and instead of accepting their fate, HSV came back and made it 2-2 through a Luka Vuskovic header.\n\nAt times in the second half, it looked as if Hamburg were the team more likely to win this game, as they had the better chances. The best example of this was when HSV countered, and a Philippe shot was cleared off the line by Alphonso Davies.\n\nBayern continued to increase the pressure on Hamburg. As the game approached full time, there would be a late penalty claim for handball, but the referee was having none of it – much to the dismay of the Bayern coaching staff and players.\n\nThe draw now means Bayern have collected just a point from a possible six from the last two matchdays. For HSV, it’s a crucial point as they sit just a point outside the relegation zone.\n\nIn typical Borussia Dortmund fashion, they left it late to win and take advantage of Bayern Munich dropping more points.\n\nDortmund hosted rock-bottom FC Heidenheim on Sunday, with everyone thinking that the home side would cruise to victory and close the gap on the league leaders to just six points.\n\nHowever, in classic Dortmund fashion, when Julian Niehues put Heidenheim 1-2 ahead in the second half, you could feel the collective groans from around Germany.\n\nDortmund pushed forward in search of an equaliser but, in doing so, left themselves exposed at the back. They were extremely fortunate not to fall two goals behind when Marvin Pieringer met a Hennes Behrens cross at the far post, only to somehow head over the crossbar when it appeared easier to score.\n\nDortmund’s pressure eventually brought them a lifeline when Niklas Dorsch handled Yan Couto’s cross inside the box. Guirassy stepped up and struck his penalty at Ramaj, who got a strong hand to it but could not prevent the ball from finding the back of the net.\n\nKovač’s men sensed blood and immediately went on the attack again, with Maximilian Beier breaking down the wing before finding Guirassy through on goal. The striker made no mistake, slipping the ball underneath Ramaj at his near post to spark scenes of jubilation inside the Westfalenstadion.\n\nBVB were then awarded another penalty when Guirassy was fouled by Tim Siersleben as he prepared to pull the trigger. With the chance to complete his hat-trick and effectively seal the win, the Guinean instead sent his spot-kick a good 10 yards over the crossbar in a woeful attempt at a Panenka.\n\nIn the closing stages, Heidenheim went in search of what they believed would have been a deserved equaliser, and in truth, they should have found it. They squandered multiple, and frankly, easy chances, to grab a late draw. On another day, Heidenheim would have run out 3-5 winners, and you wouldn’t have complained.\n\nHowever, the footballing gods were shining down on BVB, who now go six points within Bayern at the summit.\n\nWhilst there were some impressive results down the bottom of the league, possibly the biggest upset of matchday 20 was Mainz 05’s 1-2 away win at RB Leipzig.\n\nDespite Ole Werner’s side taking an early lead, the 05ers were able to rally, and a late first-half penalty from Nadiem Amiri meant it was level at the break. On the other side of half-time, winter signing Silas scored his first goal for the club too to give Mainz the lead (both of these goals were scored in the 49th minute). The win for Urs Fischer’s side means that for the first time since Bundesliga matchday five, they were out of the bottom three, and have now only lost once since the Swiss replaced Bo Henriksen.\n\nElsewhere in the Bundesliga, Eintracht Frankfurt suffered another defeat, this time against Bayer Leverkusen, who ran out 1-3 winners. It now means that from the seven games Frankfurt have played in 2026, they’ve conceded three goals in six of them. With Albert Riera taking charge on Monday, the Spaniard will have a lot of work to do when it comes to making this team a competent defensive team.\n\nWerder Bremen drew 1-1 with Borussia Monchengladbach, meaning they’re now just outside the relegation spots and winless since November. With that, the club announced the sacking of head coach Horst Steffen. Bremen are looking at Bo Henrikson or Bo Svensson as Steffen’s replacement. Either way, there’s a good chance the next head coach of Bremen will be called Bo.\n\nThere were wins for TSG Hoffenheim (3-1 vs Union Berlin), VfB Stuttgart (1-0 vs SC Freiburg), FC Köln (1-0 vs VfL Wolfsburg), and FC Augsburg (2-1 vs St. Pauli).",

    "fullText": "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has compared Benjamin Sesko and Liverpool forward Hugo Ekitike, following the former’s last-gasp winner against Fulham on Sunday.\n\nUnited produced a dramatic late show vs. Fulham at Old Trafford, to hand Michael Carrick his third successive victory since being named interim head coach.\n\nThe Red Devils took the lead in the 19th minute through Casemiro, who rose highest to head home a brilliant delivery from Bruno Fernandes. Casemiro then turned provider shortly after the break, slipping in a sensational no-look pass into the path of Matheus Cunha, who smashed the ball into the back of the net from a tight angle.\n\nCarrick’s men appeared to be cruising until Harry Maguire conceded a penalty, which Raul Jimenez scored to halve the deficit.\n\nKevin scored a screamer in stoppage time to make it 2-2 and break the hearts of United supporters, but substitute Sesko had other ideas. The Slovenian met Fernandes’s low cross, opened his body, and in one swift pivot, smashed the ball past a stranded Bernd Leno to win it.\n\nThe goal marked Sesko’s fifth in the Premier League this season, following his arrival in the summer. After the final whistle, a delighted Carrick was full of praise for the 22-year-old.\n\nHowever, speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show, Rooney strongly suggested that United could have perhaps gone for Ekitike instead of Sesko.\n\nRooney launched a comparison of Viktor Gyokeres, Ekitike and Sesko, clearly explaining why he feels Ekitike is the better striker out of the three.\n\nHe said [as quoted by the Metro], “We saw what Gyokeres did at Sporting, I know it was obviously a different country but he was scoring more goals than anyone and was absolutely on fire.”\n\n“I’ve backed Gyokeres this season and people have given me a bit of stick but I still think he’s making a different to Arsenal, I really do. He’s occupying defenders and that’s helping the team. I know he’s not got the goals or assists you’d want from your centre forward but I still think he’s having an impact.”\n\nAsked whether he would take Gyokeres ahead of Ekitike, Rooney answered, “No. Ekitike and [Granit] Xhaka at Sunderland have probably been the two best signings in the Premier League. I really enjoy watching Ekitike play. His second goal [against Newcastle] in particular was brilliant, it reminds me of Romario. A little toe-poke goal but it’s instinctive.”\n\n“He is the type of player I like to watch. He’s not a number nine, he’s not a number 10. He drifts out wide, he gets on the ball, brings players into the game and he can score goals. So he’s got a bit of everything really.”\n\nThe former England international continued, “I really enjoy watching those type of players [like Ekitike]. He’s got that arrogance and confidence.”\n\n“If you look at Sesko for instance, he looks like he needs a bit of guidance and a bit of help when he’s on the pitch. I know he scored the winner today thankfully but he looks like he needs a bit of guidance whereas Hugo Ekitike it looks like you can just put him on the pitch.”\n\n“He’s got that swagger about him which I think you need to be at that top-level.”\n\nUnited are next in action on Saturday when they host Thomas Frank’s Tottenham Hotspur in the early kick-off.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

Hibs, you look, you know, at their performance [in the draw with Rangers].\n\n\"It'll be the best top six that we've had in this split era because so many teams have so much to play for and so many strong teams are in there.\"",

    "description": "2026 F1 cars may not provide easier overtaking than their predecessors, the Haas drivers fear",
    "fullText": "Both Esteban Ocon and Oliver Bearman are pessimistic about overtaking with Formula 1’s 2026 machinery following the Barcelona pre-season test.\n\nThe Haas drivers were on track for three days – as many as allowed – in F1’s ‘shakedown’ last week and completed nearly 400 laps according to unofficial data.\n\nThat was enough to get a taste of the new VF-26, which meets F1’s revamped chassis and engine regulations for the upcoming season, featuring stripped-down aerodynamics as downforce is reduced by 15-30% and drag is cut by up to 40%.\n\nYet, overtaking may prove even trickier than in the past, based on early impressions from the Catalan running – even with the new Overtake Mode replacing DRS, which is a power boost for drivers within one second of a rival.\n\n“I've been following a few cars,” Ocon said. “You seem to lose quite a lot of front load, a bit more maybe than before, but we need to see. And the Overtake [Mode], yes, I played with it.\n\n“I don't want to give too early conclusions on how it's going to be because obviously, you know, it needs to be adjusted, optimised, etc., for that to work in a perfect way. But so far, it looks to be difficult to pass. That's my first thought about it, but I hope it's going to get on the easier side.”\n\nSophomore team-mate Bearman concurred, pointing out ‘quite a big shift in car balance’ in dirty air right behind another car.\n\n“In terms of following and overtaking and everything, I didn't really get a massive feeling on that of course, it's not a priority,” the 20-year-old Briton commented. “I managed to do a few laps in and around other cars.\n\n“I must say that it was a bit more challenging to follow, just given my relatively few laps I did. It picked up quite a big shift in balance compared to clean air, which seemed a bit more so than the previous generation of cars. But again, it's very early days.\n\n“No, I didn't really get to use the overtake mode, but I was still able to try it just in clean air. We need to obviously see the difference in cooling and all of those things. So I was able to try it, but I wasn't able to use it to overtake someone, if that makes sense.”\n\nLewis Hamilton: ‘New F1 cars more fun to drive’ than previous eras\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

It looks like the Toffees are using their other loan slot on Chelsea winger Tyrique George, so that should be it for loans from the Premier League. They do have two international loan slots to use as well should they so choose.\n\nFulback has been an area of need for the Blues for years now, even though David Moyes thinks Adam Aznou is not ready for the English top flight yet, and Jake O’Brien is his preferred choice for all things right back related. Will the Blues make a move today for one or the other?\n\nThere has been interest from the continent for Beto, Nottingham Forest and Sean Dyche have been told Dwight McNeil is not for sale and reports of an Aznou loan in Europe also abound. Doubt more than one of those three moves happen today, especially with how sparse Moyes’ squad is.\n\nTransferred – Harry Tyrer (Cardiff City – League One)\n\nLoaned – Roman Dixon (Stockport County – League One), Will Tamen (Tranmere Rovers – League Two), George Morgan (AS Cannes – Championnat National 2), Martin Sherif (Port Vale – League Two), Eli Campbell (Port Vale – League Two)\n\nThe winter transfer window closes at 7pm BST (6pm EST, 3pm PST) on Monday, February 2nd for the Premier League, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Serie A & La Liga, with an additional two hour period for clubs who have already submitted deal sheets in time.\n\nSky Sports News will be covering it all starting at 6am BST (1am EST, 10pm PST), here’s info from their website on how to watch.

    "fullText": "According to a report from Mundo Deportivo, Ferland Mendy has no intention of leaving Real Madrid, despite growing congestion in his position and the club’s desire to move him on.\n\nIt must be noted that the French full-back remains under contract with Los Blancos until 2027 and, for now, he is determined to see out his deal in Madrid.\n\nThis position comes at a time when the club is actively reviewing their options at left-back and are expected to once again open the door for Mendy’s exit in the summer.\n\nWhether that door is used, however, depends entirely on the player.\n\nThe situation at left-back has become one of the most complex puzzles for Real Madrid’s sporting department.\n\nAs things stand, the squad includes Alvaro Carreras, Fran Garcia, and Mendy as natural options for the role.\n\nOn top of that, Eduardo Camavinga has once again shown, most recently against Rayo Vallecano, that he can comfortably operate on the left side of defence when needed.\n\nFerland Mendy does not want to leave Real Madrid. (Photo by Aitor Alcalde/Getty Images)\n\nReal Madrid already made a major investment in the position last summer with the signing of Carreras from Benfica, paying a substantial €50 million to secure his arrival.\n\nInternally, the plan has been clear for some time. According to the aforementioned outlet, both Garcia and Mendy were seen as potential departures to balance the squad and reduce overcrowding.\n\nGarcia even came close to leaving during the January transfer window, but Real Madrid ultimately blocked his exit.\n\nThat leaves Mendy as the central issue. Within the club, his departure would make the most sense in terms of squad planning. However, the player’s position is very clear in his position.\n\nDespite limited continuity, injuries in recent seasons, and increased competition, Mendy has no plans to seek a move elsewhere.\n\nUnderstandably, this creates a delicate situation, as forcing an exit is not straightforward, especially with a contract running until 2027.\n\nAt the same time, carrying multiple left-backs risks reducing minutes, disrupting squad harmony, and limiting opportunities.",

    "fullText": "Juventus have made an approach to explore the availability of Everton forward Beto as the Italian giants continue their search for attacking reinforcements before the January transfer window closes. The Serie A side are understood to be prioritising the addition of a centre-forward, with sources confirming that an enquiry has been lodged in recent days.\n\nAs first reported by talkSPORT, the Premier League club are reluctant to sanction a late departure, particularly without securing a replacement. With limited time remaining in the market, Everton’s stance reflects both squad depth concerns and their wider strategy for the remainder of the season.\n\nThe developing situation places Beto at the centre of renewed transfer speculation, while Juventus weigh up their next steps in a highly competitive market.\n\nJuventus’ recruitment focus has sharpened significantly as the window enters its final stages. Senior club figures have identified the need for additional firepower, particularly in light of inconsistent goal output and the physical demands of domestic and European competition.\n\nBeto has emerged as a realistic option following internal assessments and market analysis. The Portuguese-born Guinea-Bissau international offers physical presence, aerial strength and experience in both Serie A and the Premier League, having previously featured for Udinese before joining Everton.\n\nJuventus had previously explored alternative targets, including high-profile forwards from within the Premier League, but valuation concerns and limited availability forced a reassessment. Attention has now turned towards players viewed as attainable within financial and regulatory frameworks.\n\nWhile discussions remain at an exploratory stage, the enquiry highlights Juventus’ intent to move decisively if favourable conditions arise.\n\nEverton’s reluctance to engage in formal negotiations reflects broader concerns surrounding squad balance and depth. Beto remains one of only two senior central strikers currently available to the club, making any mid-season exit a significant sporting risk.\n\nSince arriving from Udinese for a substantial fee, the striker has experienced mixed fortunes on Merseyside. He has contributed goals across competitions but has also faced periods of inconsistency and limited service.\n\nDespite this, club officials continue to value his work rate, physical contribution and professionalism. Internally, there is recognition that losing a recognised forward at this stage of the campaign could undermine stability in key fixtures.\n\nUnless Everton can identify and secure a suitable replacement in quick succession, their position is unlikely to soften.\n\nUnder David Moyes, Beto has remained an important squad figure despite fluctuating form. His recent performances, including a dramatic late equaliser away from home, have reinforced his value to the coaching staff.\n\nThe Everton manager has repeatedly highlighted the striker’s commitment and willingness to improve. Public comments following recent matches suggest belief that confidence and continuity could unlock further progress.\n\nStatistically, Beto’s output this season reflects steady, if unspectacular, returns. Three league goals and additional contributions in cup competitions underline his ability to influence games, particularly in high-pressure moments.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, his profile suits teams seeking a direct focal point, capable of occupying defenders and creating space for attacking runners. This makes him an appealing option for Juventus as they assess compatibility with their existing squad.\n\nWith the transfer window approaching its conclusion, Juventus face a strategic decision. They must weigh Everton’s firm stance against the urgency of strengthening their attack.\n\nPotential solutions include structured loan proposals, options to buy, or late compromise on valuation. However, Everton’s negotiating position remains strong, particularly given the limited time available to reinvest.\n\nFor Beto, the situation represents both opportunity and uncertainty. A return to Serie A could offer familiarity and renewed momentum, yet stability and regular minutes at Everton remain valuable for his development.\n\nUnless negotiations accelerate significantly, a move before deadline day appears challenging. Juventus may yet explore alternative targets, while Everton continue preparations with the expectation that their striker will remain.\n\nNevertheless, as recent windows have demonstrated, late-market dynamics can shift rapidly, and both clubs remain alert to developments.",

    "description": "Alex Marquez insists Gresini is the \"most solid option\" for him, but does not rule out leaving Ducati's satellite team to chase a factory seat",
    "fullText": "Alex Marquez, who is finalising his signing with KTM’s factory team for 2027, believes that more than half of the MotoGP grid will have their contracts settled before the first race of the season.\n\nThe younger Marquez's market value has increased exponentially since he finished runner-up in the 2025 standings. At 29 years of age, and after six seasons in MotoGP, the time has probably come for him to capitalise on it.\n\nIn this regard, Motorsport.com understands that the Gresini rider has virtually sealed his future from 2027 onwards with KTM. Pending the final signature, which should be formalised over the coming days, Marquez will share the garage with Maverick Vinales, who will step up from the Tech3 team.\n\n“The objective of every rider is to race for a factory team. But I’m very happy at Gresini. When the moment comes I will decide what is best for my future, but for now I want to focus on this pre-season,” Marquez said at the Sepang circuit, where the first three days of collective testing for 2026 get underway on Tuesday.\n\nIn his best season in the premier class, the Spaniard amassed three victories and a total of 12 podiums, allowing him to finish just behind his brother Marc Marquez, who was nearly untouchable until he was injured in Indonesia.\n\nIn addition to the runner-up spot, that achievement enabled Alex Marquez to improve his status within Ducati, to the point of securing the latest Desmosedici for the upcoming campaign.\n\nAfter a few frenetic days regarding the rider market, Marquez gave away little information, so that no one could interpret from his words that he has already decided which leathers he will be wearing.\n\n“We are working to have the best options when the moment to decide arrives. I won’t hide that Gresini is the most solid option, but it’s true that maybe this is a moment to take a risk, because you don’t know which bike will be the most competitive under the new regulations,” he said.\n\nMarquez has previously been a factory rider in MotoGP, riding for Repsol Honda in 2020 when he made his debut in the premier class.\n\nMarquez is convinced that most pieces of the puzzle could fall into place before the lights go out in Buriram on the first weekend of March.\n\n“More than 50% of the grid will have their future settled before the first race. Many teams, many manufacturers need to sign riders early so they don’t slip away,” he said.\n\nAlex Marquez targeting factory MotoGP seat at Yamaha and KTM\n\nThis is how every bike on the 2026 MotoGP grid looks\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. did not make the 2026 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday and social media reacted to his unexpected snub.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. was thought at one point in time to be one of the players that was going to make the All-Star Game for the first time in his career given the season that he's had to this point. In anticipation of Porter being Brooklyn's first All-Star since the 2021-22 season (Kevin Durant), there were plenty of questions asked of the organization regarding the honor, until it was revealed that Porter would not be named an All-Star after all.\n\nOn Sunday, around the same time that the Nets tipped off for what ended up being their 130-77 loss at the Detroit Pistons, it was reported by various insiders that Porter did not make the 2026 Eastern Conference All-Star team as a reserve. While there seemed to be virtual locks to make the team as a reserve, such as Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell and Atlanta Hawks forward Jalen Johnson, Porter was considered by many to be among that group due to his impact on Brooklyn this season.\n\nThe reserves for the East are Mitchell, Johnson, New York Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns, Indiana Pacers forward Pascal Siakam, Miami Heat guard Norman Powell, Toronto Raptors forward Scottie Barnes, and Detroit Pistons center Jalen Duren. Those seven players will join the five starters in Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey, Knicks guard Jalen Brunson, Pistons guard Cade Cunningham, Boston Celtics forward Jaylen Brown, and Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nWow, I really thought Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. was going to the All-Star Game. My guess is that the voting came down to Porter and Pacers forward Pascal Siakam. https://t.co/09uVZSckSk\n\n— Sharif Phillips-Keaton (@SharifKeaton) February 1, 2026\n\nPorter, 27, is having the best season of his career as he is averaging 25.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game while shooting 48.2% from the field and 39.8% from three-point land in 38 appearances. While Brooklyn (13-34) has one of the worst records in the Eastern Conference, part of Porter's case was the fact that the Nets are just 1-9 without him in the lineup, demonstrating his importance to the team.\n\nWhile Porter didn't make the All-Star team despite the push by many to see him be among the players making an All-Star appearance for the first time in their career, that doesn't take away from the fact that he's having a terrific season and he's far from the only snub. Here's how social media reacted to Porter being snubbed from the 2026 NBA All-Star Game:\n\nMichael Porter Jr. is an incredible snub from the All-Star Game.\n\nThe Eastern Conference coaches should be ashamed that they voted based on reputation and/or team record.

    "description": "The Mercedes driver, in a year of new regulations, is the early favourite for the world championship",
    "fullText": "George Russell insists he is desperate to go “head-to-head” with arch rival Max Verstappen ahead of the 2026 F1 season.\n\nMercedes driver Russell is the pre-season favourite for the world championship this year, with the Silver Arrows thought to be the early frontrunners amid a massive regulation shake-up this year.\n\nRed Bull’s Verstappen, meanwhile, fell just two points short of a fifth consecutive title last year as McLaren’s Lando Norris won his first championship. Yet Russell, who had a massive feud with Verstappen at the end of the 2024 season, is adamant he is ready to fight for a world championship, while playing down Mercedes’ tag as favourites.\n\n“I want to go head-to-head with Max,” Russell said, speaking at Mercedes’ 2026 car launch on Monday. “I think the fans are probably expecting for this year to be Mercedes vs McLaren, there’s a lot of anticipation.\n\n“But it seems that the other power units have done a good job, Red Bull have always had an amazing car and we know how good Max is.\n\n“I think he’s very much going to be in the fight this year. You obviously wish you have an easier time, but it should never be easy. If you’re going to win, you want to have fought for it on track.\n\n“I’ve been surprised by our rivals. Red Bull on the power unit side has been very impressive, kudos to them. We’ve had a very reliable test [last week], but we’ll have to wait and see if the car lives up to expectations.”\n\nBritish racer Russell, heading into his fifth season with Mercedes, insisted he doesn’t feel any extra pressure given the early ‘favourite’ tag, but did lavish praise on Aston Martin after last week’s pre-season test in Barcelona.\n\nRussell added: “We’ve only driven the car for three days [in Barcelona last week], quoting Toto, it doesn’t look like a turd!\n\n“Is it a car that can produce a world championship? It’s still too early to see. [Favourite tag] doesn’t make me feel anything. I feel ready to fight for a world championship, but we want to reel in expectations.\n\n“The best case scenario is a number of different drivers and teams all battling it out. Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren and Ferrari - four teams are all quite close, but you can’t discount what you’ve seen from Aston Martin, what Adrian [Newey] has done looks quite spectacular.\n\n“Honda have had a very good engine with Red Bull, we know what they’re capable of. It would be awesome to see a big fight.”\n\nRussell will be leading the team alongside teenager Kimi Antonelli for the second consecutive year, after Lewis Hamilton left the team in 2024.\n\nThe next pre-season test is in Bahrain on 11-13 February, with the new season starting with the Australian Grand Prix on 8 March.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool feel they've ultimately landed a player better than Marc Guehi. The Reds nearly signed the defender in the summer.\n\nMarc Guehi was incredibly close to becoming a Liverpool player this season. A deal was in place right at the end of the summer transfer window, with just about everyone convinced it would happen.\n\nEveryone except Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish, anyway. Knowing full well that his captain could leave after the season at the end of his contract.\n\nParish cancelled the deal right at the last minute when it became clear that Palace couldn't find a replacement and that's fair enough. But it left Liverpool needing a backup plan and the most obvious one was to try again for Guehi in January.\n\nHe'd be even cheaper by that stage, though not in wages. Though, it always meant that Liverpool would be paying for just five months of football rather than a full season.\n\nThey didn't want to do that in the end while Manchester City were happy to pay up. Fortunately, Liverpool feel they've landed on their feet.\n\nLiverpool are about to complete a deal for Jeremy Jacquet by all accounts. The Athletic claim it'll cost them around £55m up front, with a further £5m in add-ons.\n\nThe Reds have pushed hard to get the centre-back, who will remain with Rennes until the end of the season. But he'll join Liverpool in the summer - we'll just all have to wait.\n\nAnd there's real excitement around the 20-year-old. Jacquet is inexperienced but his reputation in France is phenomenal. Everyone appears to believe he's destined for the very, very top of the game - which is exactly what you need when replacing Virgil van Dijk is the dream here.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Haplodiploidy is a sex-determination system in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, and females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid.[1] Haplodiploidy is sometimes called arrhenotoky.\n\nHaplodiploidy determines the sex in all members of the insect orders Hymenoptera (bees, ants, and wasps)[2] and Thysanoptera ('thrips').[3] The system also occurs sporadically in some spider mites, Hemiptera, Coleoptera (bark beetles), and rotifers.\n\nIn this system, sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female, and an unfertilized egg develops as a male. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and are haploid.\n\nThe haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. For example, a male has no father and cannot have sons, but he has a grandfather and can have grandsons. Additionally, if a eusocial-insect colony has only one queen, and she has only mated once, then the relatedness between workers (diploid females) in a hive or nest will be on average 3⁄4. This means the workers in such monogamous single-queen colonies are significantly more closely related than in other sex determination systems where the relatedness of siblings is usually no more than 1⁄2. It is this point which drives the kin selection theory of how eusociality evolved.[4] Whether haplodiploidy did in fact pave the way for the evolution of eusociality is still a matter of debate.[5][6]\n\nAnother feature of the haplodiploidy system is that recessive lethal and deleterious alleles will be removed from the population rapidly because they will automatically be expressed in the males (dominant lethal and deleterious alleles are removed from the population every time they arise, as they kill any individual they arise in).[3]\n\nHaplodiploidy is not the same thing as an X0 sex-determination system. In haplodiploidy, males receive one half of the chromosomes that females receive, including autosomes. In an X0 sex-determination system, males and females receive an equal number of autosomes, but when it comes to sex chromosomes, females will receive two X chromosomes while males will receive only a single X chromosome.\n\nSeveral models have been proposed for the genetic mechanisms of haplodiploid sex-determination. The model most commonly referred to is the complementary allele model. According to this model, if an individual is heterozygous for a certain locus, it develops into a female, whereas hemizygous and homozygous individuals develop into males. In other words, diploid offspring develop from fertilized eggs, and are normally female, while haploid offspring develop into males from unfertilized eggs.\nDiploid males would be infertile, as their cells would not undergo meiosis to form sperm. Therefore, the sperm would be diploid, which means that their offspring would be triploid. Since hymenopteran mother and sons share the same genes, they may be especially sensitive to inbreeding: Inbreeding reduces the number of different sex alleles present in a population, hence increasing the occurrence of diploid males.\n\nAfter mating, each fertile hymenopteran female stores sperm in an internal sac called the spermatheca. The mated female controls the release of stored sperm from within the organ: If she releases sperm as an egg passes down her oviduct, the egg is fertilized.[7]\nSocial bees, wasps, and ants can modify sex ratios within colonies which maximizes relatedness among members and generates a workforce appropriate to surrounding conditions.[8] In other solitary hymenopterans, the females lay unfertilized male eggs on poorer food sources while laying the fertilized female eggs on better food sources, possibly because the fitness of females will be more adversely affected by shortages in their early life.[9][10] Sex ratio manipulation is also practiced by haplodiploid ambrosia beetles, who lay more male eggs when the chances for males to disperse and mate with females in different sites are greater.[11]\n\nIn honeybees, the drones (males) are entirely derived from the queen, their mother. The diploid queen has 32 chromosomes and the haploid drones have 16 chromosomes. Drones produce sperm cells that contain their entire genome, so the sperm are all genetically identical except for mutations. The male bees' genetic makeup is therefore entirely derived from the mother, while the genetic makeup of the female worker bees is half derived from the mother, and half from the father.[12] Thus, if a queen bee mates with only one drone, any two of her daughters will share, on average, 3⁄4 of their genes. The diploid queen's genome is recombined for her daughters, but the haploid father's genome is inherited by his daughters \"as is\". It is also possible for a laying worker bee to lay an unfertilised egg, which is always a male.\n\nThere are rare instances of diploid drone larvae. This phenomenon usually arises when there is more than two generations of brother-sister mating.[13] Sex determination in honey bees is initially due to a single locus, called the complementary sex determiner (csd) gene. In developing bees, if the conditions are that the individual is heterozygous for the csd gene, they will develop into females. If the conditions are so that the individual is hemizygous or homozygous for the csd gene, they will develop into males. The instances where the individual is homozygous at this gene are the instances of diploid males.[14] Diploid males do not survive to adulthood, as the nurse worker bees will cannibalize the diploid males upon hatching.[15]\n\nWhile workers can lay unfertilized eggs that become their sons, haplodiploid sex-determination system increases the individual's fitness due to indirect selection. Since the worker is more related to the queen's daughters (her sisters) than to her own offspring, helping the queen's offspring to survive helps the spread of the same genes that the worker possesses more efficiently than direct reproduction.[16]\n\nBatches of worker bees are short lived and are constantly being replaced by the next batch, so this kin selection is possibly a strategy to ensure the proper working of the hive. However, since queens usually mate with a dozen drones or more, not all workers are full sisters. Due to the separate storage of drone sperm, a specific batch of brood may be more closely related than a specific batch of brood laid at a later date. However, many other species of bees, including bumblebees, such as Bombus terrestris, are monandrous.[17] This means that sisters are almost always more related to one another than they would be to their own offspring, thus eliminating the conflict of variable relatedness present in honeybees.[18]\n\nIn wasps of the genus Nasonia, a non-CSD method of sex determination has been documented. The most recent accepted model for this non-CSD system is called Maternal Effect Genomic Imprinting Sex Determination (MEGISD). This model involves a masculinizing/virilizing maternal effect gene that “imprints upon” the cytoplasmic component of oocytes, and an “unimprinted” paternal contribution (in female offspring) that provides a counter effect to virilization and allows for female development to occur. Since all diploid eggs become female (due to the factor originating in the male genetic contribution that prevents masculinization), this differs from CSD in that under CSD, diploid eggs can become males if they are homozygous or hemizygous.[19]\n\nRelatedness is used to calculate the strength of kin selection (via Hamilton's rule).[20] The haplodiploidy hypothesis proposes that the unusual 3⁄4 relatedness coefficient amongst full haplodiploid sisters is responsible for the frequency of evolution of eusocial behavior in hymenopterans.[21] A eusocial worker helping her mother birth more sisters propagates more of her own genes than had she reproduced herself.\n\nIn normal sexual reproduction, the father has two sets of chromosomes, and crossing over takes place between the chromatids of each pair during the meiosis which produces the sperm. Therefore, the sperms are not identical, because in each chromosome of a pair there will be different alleles at many of the loci. But when the father is haploid all the sperms are identical (except for a small number where gene mutations have taken place in the germ line). So, all female offspring inherit the male's chromosomes 100% intact. As long as a female has mated with only one male, all her daughters share a complete set of chromosomes from that male. In Hymenoptera, the males generally produce enough sperm to last the female for her whole lifetime after a single mating event with that male.[20]\n\nRelatedness coefficients in haplodiploid organisms are as follows, assuming that a female has only mated once. These ratios apply, for example, throughout a bee hive, unless some laying workers produce offspring, which will all be males from unfertilised eggs: in that case, average relatedness will be lower than shown.\n\nUnder this assumption that mothers only mate once, sisters are more strongly related to each other than to their own daughters. This fact has been used to explain the evolution of eusociality in many hymenopterans. However, colonies which have workers from multiple queens or queens which have mated multiple times will have worker-to-worker relatedness which is less than worker-to-daughter relatedness, such as in Melipona scutellaris.",

    "description": "Infections had turned his lungs to soup and had to be cleared before transplant.",
    "fullText": "Humans can’t live without lungs. And yet for 48 hours, in a surgical suite at Northwestern University, a 33-year-old man lived with an empty cavity in his chest where his lungs used to be. He was kept alive by a custom-engineered artificial device that represented a desperate last-ditch effort by his doctors. The custom hardware solved a physiological puzzle that has made bilateral pneumonectomy, the removal of both lungs, extremely risky before now.\n\nThe artificial lung system was built by the team of Ankit Bharat, a surgeon and researcher at Northwestern. It successfully kept a critically ill patient alive long enough to enable a double lung transplant, temporarily replacing his entire pulmonary system with a synthetic surrogate. The system creates a blueprint for saving people previously considered beyond hope by transplant teams.\n\nThe patient, a once-healthy 33-year-old, arrived at the hospital with Influenza B complicated by a secondary, severe infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that in this case proved resistant even to carbapenems—our antibiotics of last resort. This combination of infections triggered acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a condition where the lungs become so inflamed and fluid-filled that oxygen can no longer reach the blood.\n\nIn this case, the infections were necrotizing—the cells in the lungs were dying, turning his lung tissue into a liquid. The surgeons faced a seemingly impossible choice. The patient needed a transplant to survive, but he was in refractory septic shock. His kidneys were shutting down, and his heart was failing to the point where it completely stopped shortly after hospital admission. The doctors had to bring him back with CPR.\n\nHe was too sick for a transplant, yet the very organs that needed replacing were the source of the infection fueling his decline. “When the infection is so severe that the lungs are melting, they’re irrecoverably damaged,” Bharat explained. “That’s when patients die.”\n\nTo save him, Bharat’s team had to remove the infected lungs, a procedure called a bilateral pneumonectomy, to remove the source of the sepsis. We have machines that can oxygenate the blood. But removing both lungs creates a lethal mechanical problem for the heart.\n\nThe human heart is two pumps in one. The right side, called the pulmonary circuit, pumps oxygen-poor blood returning from the body into the lungs, which remove its carbon dioxide and load it with a fresh supply of oxygen. The left side, known as the systemic circuit, receives freshly oxygenated blood and pumps it to the rest of the body. The pulmonary vascular bed, all these miles of tiny vessels inside the lungs, facilitates this gas exchange. But it also acts as a capacitor, absorbing the pressure and volume of the blood ejected by the right ventricle.\n\nIf you remove the lungs and simply shut the pulmonary arteries, the right ventricle has nowhere to pump—it would experience an immediate, massive pressure spike, distend like a balloon, and fail within minutes. At the same time, the left side of the heart would have no blood returning to it, leading to a total collapse of blood pressure and systemic circulation.\n\nThis is the reason why most double-lung transplants are performed sequentially: The surgeons replace one lung, get it up and running, and then move on to the second. But desperate times require desperate measures.\n\nIn rare cases where both lungs must be removed at once, a patient can still be supported by the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), a mechanical lung that takes blood out of the body, removes the carbon dioxide, adds oxygen, and pumps it back in. The problem is that while ECMO can support a person for up to over a year when their lungs are still in their body, the risks of using it skyrocket when the lungs are removed.\n\nThe empty chest cavity creates a void where blood and fluids can pool, leading to huge internal bleeding. The heart, which relies on the physical presence and pressure of the lungs to maintain its proper anatomical position, can flop around or collapse. Finally, circulating blood through complex machinery significantly increases the risk of stroke or clotting.\n\nBecause of all these risks, surgeons always treat removing both lungs as the last line of defense, one they can only rely on for a short time—the shorter the better. Bharat and his colleagues, though, had to keep their patient this way until the sepsis had been dealt with.\n\nIt wasn’t enough for the team to keep the patient alive without lungs in his body until the transplant arrived. In this lungless state, somehow, they had to improve his health.\n\nTo make this happen, Bharat’s team engineered a device they called the “flow-adaptive extracorporeal total artificial lung system” (TAL), a complex circuit designed to mimic the physics of the missing organs. At its core was a pump and an oxygenator borrowed from the standard ECMO setup, but it also used four new components to replace biological functions.\n\nThe first was a dual-lumen cannula, essentially a single tube with two separate channels inside. Inserted through the internal jugular vein, this tube acted as the primary drain. It allowed the team to pull deoxygenated blood directly from the right side of the heart, unloading the right ventricle to prevent it from distending.\n\nThe second component was something the researchers called a flow-adaptive shunt, which connected the right pulmonary artery back to the right atrium. When the right ventricle pumped out more blood than the external pump could handle, the excess blood would safely recirculate back into the atrium through this low-resistance path, protecting the heart and the surgical staples from pressure spikes. During the 48 hours the patient was supported by the TAL, this shunt self-regulated its flow to anywhere between 1.1 and 6.3 liters per minute, based on the patient’s needs.\n\nTo ensure the left side of the heart stayed full and active, the team used a device called dual left atrial return. It comprised two 10 mm grafts that returned oxygenated blood from the ECMO artificial lung directly into the left atrium. This, the team said in a paper that describes the hardware, maintained what’s called Starling physiology: the principle that the heart pumps better when it is properly filled. It also prevented blood from stagnating and forming clots inside the heart chambers.\n\nFinally, to prevent the heart from physically shifting and damaging vital vessels in the empty chest cavity, the surgeons used bovine pericardium to reconstruct the heart’s protective sac and filled the empty space with tissue expanders and surgical sponges.\n\nThe results of hooking the patient up to TAL were immediate.\n\nWithin hours of the surgery, the patient’s septic shock began to resolve. His lactate levels, a key marker of tissue oxygen starvation, dropped from a dangerous 8.2 mmol/L to a normal level of less than 1.0 mmol/L within 24 hours. The medications used to keep his blood pressure up were discontinued after just 12 hours.\n\nFor two days, the patient lived as a human being with no lungs, stabilized by a machine that breathed and buffered his circulation with surgical precision. When donor lungs became available 48 hours later, the patient’s body was no longer suffering from sepsis.\n\nHe was ready for the transplant, which the team successfully performed. And after putting in the new lungs, they focused on the lungs they had removed.\n\nConventionally, patients with ARDS do not get transplants because doctors hope that with the right treatment and support, the diseased lungs will eventually heal. But the examination of the infected lungs removed from Bharat’s patient told a different story and helped define the clinical point of no return, when a lung is truly dead.\n\nBased on the spatial transcriptomics, a set of techniques that let scientists see which genes are active at different sites in the tissue, the team built a high-resolution molecular map of the removed lungs. What they found was a landscape of total devastation.\n\nThe lungs were filled with aberrant basaloid cells—a signature of failed regeneration. The stem cells required to rebuild the lungs were almost entirely gone. The architecture was uniformly destroyed and replaced by cells that were laying down scar tissue.\n\n“People think if you get severe ARDS, you keep supporting them and ultimately the lungs will get better,” Bharat says.  The data collected by his team suggested no amount of waiting or life support would have brought this patient’s lungs back to life. “In my practice, young patients die almost every week because no one realized that transplantation was an option,” Bharat added.\n\nIn many hospitals, patients with severe, acute lung infections are often allowed to die because they are considered too unstable for surgery. While Bharat’s study offers some hope that this situation might improve in the future, the team admits that their approach currently requires immense expertise and access to a highly specialized medical center with donor lungs. Making expertise and resources more accessible will take some time.\n\nAnd that’s not the only thing we have to wait for. Bharat and his colleagues note in their paper that one key challenge in ARDS is determining whether the injury is reversible. His study offers some initial insights into diagnosing irreversible damage, but the researchers note that their conclusions were based on a single case. The features of lungs that are beyond repair may differ across various pathogens, stages of disease, or the way individual patient’s body responds to the disease.\n\nFor Bharat’s patient, though, all possible stars aligned. The paper says that two years after the procedure, he has returned to a normal, independent life with excellent lung function.\n\nMed, 2026. DOI: 10.1016/j.medj.2025.100985",

    "title": "Context-Generic Programming v0.6.1 Release: Improving Ergonomics and Debugging",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "This blog post is co-authored by Claude Haiku based on a human draft. All content has been reviewed by the human author.\n\nWe're excited to announce the release of cgp v0.6.1, which brings several quality-of-life improvements to Context-Generic Programming in Rust. This release focuses on making CGP more accessible to developers new to the paradigm while also providing better debugging and verification tools for complex provider setups.\n\nThe changes in this release reflect our commitment to lowering the barrier to entry for CGP, while maintaining the power and flexibility that make it such a compelling approach to modular Rust code. Whether you're an experienced CGP user or just getting started, we believe you'll find these improvements meaningful.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles when learning CGP is understanding how generic Context parameters work in provider implementations. While generics are fundamental to Rust, they can be intimidating to developers coming from object-oriented backgrounds, or even to experienced Rust developers who haven't deeply explored the generic type system.\n\nWhen writing a #[cgp_impl] provider, you previously had to explicitly declare the Context as a generic parameter and ensure it appeared correctly throughout your implementation. This added cognitive overhead that wasn't directly related to the business logic you were implementing. For beginners, this meant wrestling with generic syntax before they could even focus on understanding the core CGP concepts like delegation and trait constraints.\n\nCGP v0.6.1 introduces support for implicit Context types in the #[cgp_impl] macro. You can now omit the explicit generic parameter and use familiar Rust patterns like Self to refer to the context type.\n\nLet's look at a concrete example. Suppose we're building a greeting system where different types can greet people:\n\nBefore v0.6.1, the provider implementation would look like:\n\nWith v0.6.1, you can simplify this to:\n\nThe difference might seem small at first glance, but it has a profound impact on readability and accessibility. The new syntax eliminates the generic parameter syntax entirely, making the provider implementation look much more like a standard Rust trait implementation. For someone new to CGP coming from an OOP background, this is far less intimidating—it reads like implementing a method on a class, which is a familiar pattern.\n\nThis improvement particularly shines when you have multiple providers in a codebase. Each provider definition becomes clearer and more focused on the actual logic, rather than the generic plumbing.\n\nAs your CGP applications grow in complexity, so does the challenge of verifying that all your provider wiring is correct. This is particularly true when using higher-order providers—providers that accept other providers as generic parameters.\n\nWhen you compose multiple providers together and something goes wrong, the compiler error messages can be cryptic. The error might point to a deep dependency in the chain, but it won't clearly tell you which individual provider in the composition is actually failing. This forces developers to compile and test repeatedly, changing providers and wiring patterns to narrow down the issue.\n\nCGP v0.6.1 introduces the #[check_providers] attribute for the check_components! macro, which lets you verify that specific providers work correctly with a given context. This is a powerful debugging tool that allows you to isolate and test individual providers before wiring them into your context.\n\nHere's a simple example. Suppose we have a shape area calculation system:\n\nYou can verify that RectangleArea works with Rectangle using:\n\nWith the new #[check_providers] attribute, you can also verify the provider directly:\n\nWhat's the benefit? The #[check_providers] version checks whether RectangleArea itself can be used as a provider for the component, regardless of what's currently wired in your Rectangle context. This is useful if you're developing multiple providers and want to test them independently before integrating them into your system.\n\nThe real power of #[check_providers] becomes apparent when you're working with composed higher-order providers. Let's look at a more realistic example:\n\nNow, when we verify this setup, we want to ensure not only that the composed provider works, but also that each individual component in the composition is correct. We can do this:\n\nThe first check verifies that the wired provider works with the context. The second check verifies each individual provider (or provider combination) that makes up your composition. If something is broken, such as the width field is missing, the error messages from these targeted checks will clearly point you to the problematic provider, rather than the entire composition.\n\nThis is a game-changer for debugging complex CGP setups. Instead of staring at a wall of compiler errors and trying to trace through the dependency chain, you can surgically test each part of your provider composition.\n\nOne common pattern in CGP is using getter traits to extract values from your context. The #[cgp_auto_getter] macro makes this convenient by automatically implementing a getter that reads a field from your context using the HasField trait.\n\nHowever, there was one limitation that made more sophisticated getter traits tedious to work with: you couldn't define an abstract type for the return value of your getter. If you wanted a getter trait where the return type was customizable per context, you had to define a separate abstract type trait, then link it to your getter trait.\n\nThis meant the old pattern looked like:\n\nThis works, but it requires defining two separate traits when conceptually you just want one getter trait with a flexible return type. For simple cases, this felt like boilerplate.\n\nCGP v0.6.1 allows you to define associated types directly in getter traits, eliminating the need for the separate type trait. You can now write:\n\nThe HasName trait now has an abstract Name type, and when the auto-getter is derived for Person, it automatically implements HasName with String as the concrete Name type. This is much more concise and reads more naturally.\n\nThe benefits are particularly clear when you have multiple getters with abstract types. Instead of maintaining a parallel set of type traits, you can keep everything in one place, making your code easier to understand and maintain.\n\nIf you're using the more powerful #[cgp_getter] macro (which allows customization of the implementation through providers), the same support for associated types works seamlessly:\n\nEven though our struct has a first_name field, we can still use the HasName getter by wiring it with UseField. The #[cgp_getter] macro combined with associated types gives you both power and convenience.\n\nThese three changes—implicit Context types, enhanced provider checking, and associated types in getters—work together to achieve our goal: making CGP more accessible and maintainable without sacrificing its power.\n\nThe improvements lower the learning curve for new CGP users by reducing generic syntax overhead. They provide better tooling for verifying and debugging complex provider compositions. And they reduce boilerplate when defining sophisticated traits, freeing you to focus on business logic.\n\nAs your CGP codebase grows, you'll find yourself reaching for these new features frequently. The #[cgp_impl] simplification makes your code more readable. The #[check_providers] attribute helps you debug faster. And associated types in getters let you express your intent more directly.\n\nWe believe CGP v0.6.1 represents a meaningful step forward in making Context-Generic Programming more approachable and productive. These changes emerged directly from feedback and real-world usage patterns in the CGP community, and we're confident they'll improve the development experience for everyone.\n\nWe encourage you to upgrade to v0.6.1 and explore these new features. Try simplifying your provider implementations with implicit Context types. Use #[check_providers] to debug your next complex provider composition. Define getter traits with abstract types and feel the difference in conciseness and clarity.\n\nAs always, we welcome feedback, bug reports, and contributions. The CGP journey continues, and we're excited to see what you build with these new tools.",

    "title": "A Taxonomy for AI Agents",
    "description": "Learn how to categorize AI agents across the automation spectrum—from deterministic workflows to fully autonomous agents. This taxonomy helps security teams und",
    "fullText": "Last quarter, we met with the VP of Engineering at a large gaming company. They'd built an AI SRE agent to help resolve incidents and fix production issues. For weeks, it worked beautifully—triaging alerts, identifying root causes, even suggesting fixes their team would have taken hours to develop.\n\nThen one day, it DoSed their internal monitoring system.\n\nThe agent had permissions to query their monitoring APIs. It was supposed to use them to gather context for incident response. But when it decided those APIs might hold the answer to a particularly thorny issue, it started hammering them with requests until the system fell over.\n\nThey shut the agent down (obviously). But unplugging the agent is a blunt instrument—it means losing all the goodness they were getting before.\n\nAn agent is a system. To secure any system, you need the right mental model to reason about it. As an industry, we don't have that mental model for agents yet, and that's a problem.\n\nWithout a shared mental model of what an agent is, we can't decompose it. And if we can't decompose it, we can't design security around it. The disasters make headlines. More commonly, though, concerns about agent security are leading to agents so locked down they can barely do anything.\n\nNon-determinism is both the promise and the peril of agents. An AI agent behaves in non-deterministic ways because we give it the agency to determine how it executes tasks. You can't remove that autonomy without gutting the agent—but you can mitigate the risks. The most fundamental control is permissions. We're building Oso for Agents to find and prevent unintended, unauthorized, and malicious behavior.\n\nThis taxonomy draws from Wade Foster's sharp post on the \"AI Automation Spectrum\" and prior work by Anthropic, Tines, and Simon Willison. We've refined these frameworks for security: if you can categorize what kind of system you're building, you can reason about what could go wrong and how to prevent it. Many organizations want to move from left to right on a spectrum of autonomy, but most are stuck because they can't reason about what agents might do. This taxonomy is a diagnostic tool. Know what's non-deterministic, and you'll know where the risk is and what controls to apply.\n‍\n\nLet's imagine we're a retailer. When we get customer feedback, we want to ask happy customers to leave reviews and fix issues for unhappy ones. We want to automate this. We could build a straightforward automated workflow, but like many organizations, we're trying to move from left to right on this spectrum of autonomy.\n\nWe automate this as a set of deterministic steps. Store the feedback in the CRM, use a classical ML model to score sentiment, check if it's positive or negative, then branch: for positive feedback, send a templated review request with the customer's name merged in. For negative feedback, check whether they're a small or large customer, then either send a templated apology or create a support ticket with a formulaic summary of their history.\n\nDefinition: Deterministic steps or nodes, automated in code or with a workflow automation tool\n\nWhat's deterministic: Everything\n\nWhat's non-deterministic: Nothing\n\nSecurity assumptions we can safely make: I know exactly what this system will do\n‍\n\nAs we move right on the spectrum, we replace one or more steps with an LLM—usually content generation. Now instead of a template apology, an LLM writes a customized response based on the specific feedback. Or it generates a more nuanced summary of customer history for the support team.\n\nDefinition: An automated workflow with an LLM used to execute one or more steps\n\nWhat's deterministic: Which steps are taken and the control flow between them\n\nWhat's non-deterministic: Actions taken inside a step (e.g., content generation)\n\nSecurity assumptions we can safely make: I know what it will do, but not what it will say\n‍\n\nNow we're entering agentic territory. An LLM not only produces content but also reasons about control flow. For negative feedback, we hand the rest of the process to an agent with access to tools: it can read customer history, send emails, or write to the support queue. The agent decides which tools to use and in what order—maybe it checks history first, or maybe it sends an immediate apology. We've bounded its options, but we haven't prescribed the path.\n\nWade's framework defines agentic workflows differently: an LLM is used in multiple steps, but each step remains self-contained and the flow between them is deterministic. That's reasonable for demonstrating the value ladder of AI automation. But for security, we need a brighter line. The question is: does the LLM manage any of the control flow? If it does, you need to reason about all possible paths it might take, not just the content it might generate. That's a fundamentally different security posture.\n\nDefinition: An automated workflow where part but not all of the control flow is managed by an LLM\n\nWhat's deterministic: Some control flow\n\nWhat's non-deterministic: Step content, some control flow\n\nSecurity assumptions we can safely make: I know the boundaries of possible paths, but not what path it will take\n‍\n\nAn agent does the whole thing. It gets the raw customer feedback and decides everything: Is it positive or negative? What's the customer's history? Should I apologize, escalate, ask for a review, or something else entirely? It reasons about what tools to use, uses them, and solves the task end-to-end.\n\nWe only consider something a full agent if it has this end-to-end agency. Any situation where you explicitly lay out the steps doesn't qualify—including workflow automation tools, even when they lean heavily on LLMs. This level of non-deterministic behavior requires a different security posture to respond to all the things an agent could do.\n\nDefinition: A task executed end-to-end by an LLM\n\nWhat's non-deterministic: Everything\n\nSecurity assumptions we can safely make: It will only use tools it can access, but how and whether it will use them is unknown\n‍\n\nNote on agentic systems: We use \"agentic systems\" as an umbrella term for agentic workflows, agents, and multi-agent systems. From a security perspective, treat every agentic system as equivalent to a full agent except to the extent that you can point at deterministic controls that bound that agency.\n‍\n\nYou can frame the security implications of agents in different ways, and each one means something different for how you would solve it.\n\nSome say \"just solve prompt injection, and there won't be any problems.\" Let us know once you've sorted that out. Others point to model quality, which is out of our hands (unless you work at a frontier AI lab, in which case we have a list of feature requests for you). Still others frame it as a data loss problem, but data loss has never been solved, even outside AI.\n\nThe risk vectors are everywhere—see the OWASP Agentic Top 10 for a taste. No single framing will capture everything that could go wrong.\n\nNon-determinism is a feature, not a bug—though it comes with security implications. You can't remove it without removing the agent's agency and demoting it on the spectrum of autonomy.\n\nSo don't fight non-determinism. Bound it instead. Play on its home court where it makes sense—e.g., applying agentic oversight to content generation and reasoning. For the really dangerous areas (tool access, data exposure), constrain behaviors with deterministic controls.\n\nWhat's the OG deterministic control for governing who can do what? Permissions.\n‍\n\nPermissions are part of the basic infrastructure of any real application. But we know the state of permissions is not healthy.\n\nOverpermissioning is the status quo. Analysis of Oso permissions data confirms this (report coming soon). What could you—or an agent with your permissions—do that would be bad?\n\nOne reason people freak out about agents: they intuitively connect these dots. They know people are overpermissioned, they know agents behave non-deterministically, and they can foresee future disasters. \"I accidentally deleted that Salesforce record once and the system just let me do it. hat's going to happen if I ask an agent to update Salesforce for me?\"\n\nIf we replicate the overpermissioned state of humans in automated systems, what's the danger?\n\nAn agent should only ever have the permissions for the task at hand. That would mitigate most of the risk. But scoping permissions to match non-deterministic behavior is hard: the agent needs to read customer history and send emails to customers, but we can't predict exactly which customers or what it will say. How can we be certain it won't leak information?\n\nThis taxonomy shows you what you're building. It doesn't show you how to make it safe.\n\nThat gaming company faced a choice between useful and dangerous. The entire industry faces that choice right now. We can build powerful agents or we can build safe agents, but not yet both.\n\nThis is supposed to be the decade of agents. But that only happens if we can trust them. That means building infrastructure that doesn't exist yet: simulation to test dangerous paths, enforcement that tightens permissions automatically, detection that catches drift, visibility that shows what actually happened.\n\nThe taxonomy maps the problem. Now we need to build the solution. That's the work that matters—not because it's technically interesting, but because it's what unlocks everything else agents could be.",

    "description": "Shifting focus to real websites, Gmail performance, site compatibility, painting architecture, IPC hardening, HTTP caching, media streaming, and more.",
    "fullText": "Over the past year, we’ve invested heavily in web platform test suites and benchmarks, and that work has paid off — giving us a solid, well-tested foundation with good coverage of edge cases and spec corners. With an alpha release on the horizon, we’re now building on that foundation by making real websites and daily-driver usability our primary focus. We’ll continue tracking test scores and fixing test failures, but the day-to-day priority is now getting real sites working well. January’s 324 merged PRs from 40 contributors reflect that shift, with much of the month spent profiling, fixing, and optimizing real-world sites.\n\nLadybird is entirely funded by the generous support of companies and individuals who believe in the open web. This month, we’re excited to welcome the following new sponsors:\n\nWe’re incredibly grateful for their support. If you’re interested in sponsoring the project, please contact us.\n\nAn unfortunate reality of the modern web is that many websites check your User-Agent string and serve different content (or no content at all) based on what browser they think you are. With our previous UA string, we were getting degraded UIs, “your browser is not supported” pages, network throttling, and outright HTTP 403 errors from many prominent websites.\n\nWe fixed this by adding “Chrome/140.0.0.0” (#7493) and “AppleWebKit/537.36 Safari/537.36” (#7626) to our UA string. “Ladybird” is still in there. We’re not trying to hide, but we do need to play the game if we want websites to serve us their real content. This immediately unlocked modern versions of Google Search, Gmail, Instagram, and many other sites.\n\nInstagram before and after the UA string change:\n\nGmail loaded before January, but Google was serving us a degraded UI due to the old User-Agent string, performance was poor, and much of the interface wasn’t properly clickable. With the UA fix giving us the real Gmail UI, we spent a good chunk of the month on performance and correctness.\n\nThrough a series of profiling-driven PRs, we knocked roughly a second off the inbox load time:\n\nWe also fixed three hit testing bugs that made the compose window fully mouse interactive (#7613).\n\nGmail wasn’t the only site that got attention this month:\n\nOur WPT scores continued to climb alongside the real-world work. This month we’ve added 13,690 new test passes, bringing our total to 1,991,061.\n\nFor context, here are the current top 6 browser engines and their WPT scores today vs. one month ago.\n\nWe replaced the old ClipFrame / PushStackingContext / PopStackingContext system with a new AccumulatedVisualContext tree (#7471). This tree pre-computes accumulated transforms, clips, scroll offsets, and effects for each paintable, eliminating per-frame recalculation during display list playback and hit testing.\n\nThe new architecture fixes a class of bugs where hit testing through nested transforms, scroll containers, and clip-paths would produce incorrect results. It also enables skipping off-screen display list commands with effects like blur, which is particularly beneficial for pages like Discord’s landing page that have many blurred decorative images (#7576).\n\nOn the performance side, we also started caching GPU textures for bitmap-backed images instead of re-uploading every frame (#7610), caching SkTextBlobs so text blobs are built once during display list recording and reused across paints (#7607), and moved SVG mask/clip composition from CPU to GPU (#7503).\n\nBuilding on December’s streaming media work, we added HTTP range request support for media playback (#7473). Video can now start playing without waiting for the entire file to download, and seeking to an unbuffered position triggers a new range request instead of waiting for sequential download.\n\nWe also made video frames go to Skia as subsampled YUV data instead of converting to RGB on the CPU (#7549). This offloads color conversion to the GPU, allowing high-resolution video playback without interruptions on machines where the CPU can keep up with decoding. Paused videos now also release their decoded data and decoders after a timeout to save memory (#7566).\n\nFullscreen mode now works on YouTube (#7649), building on the initial fullscreen implementation from #4330. We don’t yet support MediaSource Extensions, so YouTube serves us 360p H.264 fallback video, but it plays and fullscreens correctly:\n\nWe did a security hardening pass on LibIPC (#7569). Previously, malformed IPC messages could crash the receiving process. Now, decode failures disconnect the peer gracefully, message sizes and file descriptor counts are bounded, and checked arithmetic prevents integer overflows in size calculations. The guiding principle: suspicious incoming messages cause a clean disconnect; encoding errors (our own bugs) still crash immediately so they’re caught quickly.\n\nOur Firefox DevTools integration gained network monitoring support (#7472): request and response body viewing, request initiator types, navigation events, and streaming console messages. You can now inspect network traffic in Ladybird using Firefox DevTools.\n\nWe’d like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:\n\nAdam Colvin, Ali Mohammad Pur, Aliaksandr Kalenik, Andreas Kling, Andrew Kaster, aplefull, ayeteadoe, Ben Eidson, Callum Law, Christoffer Haglund, Colleirose, CountBleck, dosisod, Estefania, Federico Tedin, Gingeh, InvalidUsernameException, Jelle Raaijmakers, Jonathan Gamble, Kenneth Myhra, Lorenz A, Luke Wilde, matjojo, Michael Watt, mikiubo, Psychpsyo, pwespi, R-Goc, Reimar, Rocco Corsi, Sam Atkins, Samq64, Shannon Booth, sideshowbarker, Tete17, Tim Ledbetter, Timothy Flynn, Totto16, Undefine, Zaggy1024",

    "title": "11 Performance Cars From the 1970s That Were Misunderstood at the Time",
    "description": "The 1970s strangled horsepower with emissions rules, fuel shocks, and insurance pressure—yet a handful of clever performance cars slipped through. Here are 11 machines once dismissed as weird or weak, now praised for lightness, handling, turbo tech, and real-world charm.",
    "fullText": "The 1970s weren't kind to performance cars. Between stricter emissions regulations, the oil crisis, and insurance companies declaring war on horsepower, the decade seemed intent on killing off the muscle car era entirely. But while enthusiasts mourned the loss of their big-block monsters, they missed something important: several manufacturers were quietly figuring out how to make fast cars work in this new reality.\n\nThese 11 performance machines were dismissed, ridiculed, or simply ignored when they were new, but history has been far more generous in its assessment.\n\nAMC's oddball compact looked like it was designed by someone who gave up halfway through, but a Gremlin ordered with the available 304 cubic inch V8 was genuinely punchy for the era. The 304 was rated around 150 horsepower (SAE net) when it arrived for 1972. In a small car, performance could be lively, but published 0 to 60 times varied by test and spec.\n\nPeople laughed at the styling, but AMC understood that lighter cars with smaller V8s were the future of affordable performance.\n\nEnthusiasts accused the 914 of not being a \"real Porsche\" because it had a Volkswagen engine and a reasonable price tag. Its unique looks stand out from Porsche's familiar shape, and the mid-engine layout gave it handling that embarrassed more expensive sports cars, and the 914/6 version with the Porsche flat-six was legitimately fast.\n\nToday, clean examples sell for serious money as collectors finally appreciate what they dismissed as a parts-bin special.\n\nAmerican car magazines initially treated Nissan's sports car like a curiosity rather than a legitimate performance machine. The 240Z delivered 150 horsepower, a 125 mph top speed, and handling that could run with Porsches for about half the price.\n\nIt took a few years for people to realize that Datsun had essentially built a better E-Type Jaguar without the electrical gremlins.\n\nYes, the Vega had exaggerated reliability issues that would make a British Leyland engineer blush, but the GT version with the optional handling package was surprisingly fun to drive. The aluminum four-cylinder’s output depended heavily on year and rating method. Early gross ratings could be quoted as high as 110 hp for certain versions, but early 1970s net ratings were typically lower. The suspension tuning could still be genuinely competent, even if the power numbers were not always as impressive as the brochure era suggests.\n\nIf GM had solved the Vega’s early durability issues, the Vega GT might be remembered as an American sporty coupe instead of a punchline.\n\nIt made 139 horsepower, which sounds pathetic until you remember that a 1980 Corvette’s base engine was rated at 190 horsepower, while the optional higher-output version was rated higher depending on specification.\n\nThe handling was surprisingly good thanks to the compact dimensions, and today's collectors are starting to appreciate these as the last affordable classic Mustangs.\n\nEveryone remembers the Trans Am, but the Formula could be a close cousin depending on the year and options. Both shared the same basic platform, and many performance parts were available across the range, but engines and suspension packages varied by model year and configuration, and some high-performance pieces were not universal.\n\nPontiac sold and produced far fewer Formulas because people wanted the Trans Am's image, but smart buyers got the same experience without paying for the billboard.\n\nBMW built Europe's first turbocharged production car in 1973, and the automotive press responded with confusion and concern about turbo lag. The 2002 Turbo made 170 horsepower and could hit 130 mph, making it one of the fastest sedans available.\n\nOnly 1,672 were built before the oil crisis killed it, and those that survive are worth a small fortune today.\n\nThe Stratos was too weird, too impractical, and too purpose-built for rallying to make sense as a road car. With a Ferrari Dino V6 mounted behind the seats and a wheelbase shorter than a modern Mini Cooper, it drove like a go-kart designed by someone on espresso.\n\nLancia built about 492 Stratos road cars for homologation purposes, and now they're six-figure collectibles that dominated top-level rally results in the mid-1970s.\n\nMopar fans obsessed over Cudas and Challengers while the humble Duster delivered similar performance for thousands less. The 340 cubic inch V8 made 275 horsepower in 1970 and could run mid-14-second quarter miles right off the showroom floor. It was essentially a cheap body on Plymouth's excellent\n\nAn A-body platform, but people dismissed it as a secretary's car with a bigger engine.\n\nRotary engines seemed like a gimmick to most Americans, and the RX-3's tinny build quality didn't help its case. Mazda RX-3 power and engine details varied by market and year. Some early RX-3 road tests cite about 110 bhp from the smaller 10A rotary, while later versions used larger rotary engines, and US emissions-era net ratings could be lower. Weight also varied by body style and equipment, but the car was generally light for its class.\n\nThe RX-3 was very successful in SCCA competition in the mid-1970s, even while some buyers and readers remained skeptical of rotary engines and fuel economy.\n\nWhen the Esprit debuted in late 1975 and entered production in 1976, critics complained it was underpowered with about 160 horsepower in European trim from its 2.0-liter four-cylinder, with lower ratings in some US versions. What they missed was that Lotus had built a mid-engine exotic that weighed about 2,116 pounds and handled like it was on rails.\n\nThe wedge styling looked like it came from a science fiction movie, and while early cars had quality issues, the Esprit established Lotus as a legitimate supercar manufacturer for the next three decades.\n\nThe 1970s forced the automotive industry to rethink everything it knew about performance, and these twelve cars represent different approaches to the same problem. Some went lighter, some went turbo, and some just ignored convention entirely. What they share is that contemporary audiences didn't quite know what to make of them, whether due to unfamiliar technology, unconventional packaging, or simply showing up at the wrong moment in history.\n\nToday, these misunderstood machines are finally getting the recognition they deserved all along, proving that sometimes the automotive press and buying public need a few decades of perspective to separate the genuinely interesting cars from the merely loud ones.",

How many of you went to a Stop the Steal protest with a loaded automatic weapon?”—prompting the entire room of ICE agents to raise their hands.\n\n“You gotta do better,” Davidson says, briefly breaking character. “I’m Tom Homan, OK? I am the separating-families-at-the-border guy. I’m the on-film-taking-a-$50,000-bribe guy. And y’all are making me look like the upstanding, reasonable adult in the room. That’s crazy!”\n\nIn her post, Katie implored her followers to imagine if SNL “actually mocked their globalist overlords instead of bowing to their groupthink,” before adding, “ICE are heroes.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to NBC for comment.\n\nKatie went to war on X for her husband last week as Miller, 40, faced a firestorm in the wake of the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti, whom he initially smeared as an “assassin.”\n\nDonald Trump’s deputy chief of staff and the architect of his harshest immigration policies was effectively sidelined alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when the president sent Homan to “de-escalate” Minneapolis.\n\nNoem, 54, who had smeared Pretti herself, tried to pass the blame onto Miller, reportedly saying that she had acted “at the direction of the president and Stephen.”\n\nKatie rushed to Miller’s defense, circulating his statement that pinned the blame on Customs and Border Protection, which falls under Noem’s Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe Millers’ united damage control was widely ridiculed.\n\nKatie, who regularly derides things that rub her the wrong way as “woke,” blew up last week after finding out that first lady Melania Trump’s widely-panned film was getting pulled from South Africa.\n\n“Of course—since they are biased against white people,” Miller wrote, referring to a country that was governed under a racist white-minority apartheid regime for decades.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — European allies and Canada are pouring billions of dollars into helping Ukraine, and they have pledged to massively boost their budgets to defend their territories.\n\nBut despite those efforts, NATO’s credibility as a unified force under U.S. leadership has taken a huge hit over the past year as trust within the 32-nation military organization dissolved.\n\nThe rift has been most glaring over U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. More recently, Trump's disparaging remarks about his NATO allies' troops in Afghanistan drew another outcry.\n\nWhile the heat on Greenland has subsided for now, the infighting has seriously undercut the ability of the world’s biggest security alliance to deter adversaries, analysts say.\n\n“The episode matters because it crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed,” Sophia Besch from the Carnegie Europe think tank said in a report on the Greenland crisis. “Even without force or sanctions, that breach weakens the alliance in a lasting way.”\n\nThe tensions haven’t gone unnoticed in Russia, NATO’s biggest threat.\n\nAny deterrence of Russia relies on ensuring that President Vladimir Putin is convinced that NATO will retaliate should he expand his war beyond Ukraine. Right now, that does not seem to be the case.\n\n“It’s a major upheaval for Europe, and we are watching it,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted last week.\n\nCriticized by U.S. leaders for decades over low defense spending, and lashed relentlessly under Trump, European allies and Canada agreed in July to significantly up their game and start investing 5% of their gross domestic product on defense.\n\nThe pledge was aimed at taking the whip out of Trump's hand. The allies would spend as much of their economic output on core defense as the United States — around 3.5% of GDP — by 2035, plus a further 1.5% on security-related projects like upgrading bridges, air and seaports.\n\nNATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has hailed those pledges as a sign of NATO’s robust health and military might. He recently said that “fundamentally thanks to Donald J. Trump, NATO is stronger than it ever was.”\n\nThough a big part of his job is to ensure that Trump does not pull the U.S. out of NATO, as Trump has occasionally threatened, his flattery of the American leader has sometimes raised concern. Rutte has pointedly refused to speak about the rift over Greenland.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed in 1949 to counter the security threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and its deterrence is underpinned by a strong American troop presence in Europe.\n\nThe alliance is built on the political pledge that an attack on one ally must be met with a response from them all — the collective security guarantee enshrined in Article 5 of its rule book.\n\nIt hinges on the belief that the territories of all 32 allies must remain inviolate. Trump’s designs on Greenland attack that very principle, even though Article 5 does not apply in internal disputes because it can only be triggered unanimously.\n\n“Instead of strengthening our alliances, threats against Greenland and NATO are undermining America’s own interests,” two U.S. senators, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Lisa Murkowski, wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n“Suggestions that the United States would seize or coerce allies to sell territory do not project strength. They signal unpredictability, weaken deterrence and hand our adversaries exactly what they want: proof that democratic alliances are fragile and unreliable,” they said.\n\nEven before Trump escalated his threats to seize control of Greenland, his European allies were never entirely convinced that he would defend them should they come under attack.\n\nTrump has said that he doesn’t believe the allies would help him either, and he recently drew more anger when he questioned the role of European and Canadian troops who fought and died alongside Americans in Afghanistan. The president later partially reversed his remarks.\n\nIn testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed criticism that Trump has undermined the alliance.\n\n“The stronger our partners are in NATO, the more flexibility the United States will have to secure our interests in different parts of the world,” he said. “That’s not an abandonment of NATO. That is a reality of the 21st century and a world that’s changing now.”\n\nDespite NATO’s talk of increased spending, Moscow seems undeterred. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said this week that “it has become painfully clear that Russia will remain a major security threat for the long term.”\n\n“We are fending off cyberattacks, sabotage against critical infrastructure, foreign interference and information manipulation, military intimidation, territorial threats and political meddling,” she said Wednesday.\n\nOfficials across Europe have reported acts of sabotage and mysterious drone flights over airports and military bases. Identifying the culprits is difficult, and Russia denies responsibility.\n\nIn a year-end address, Rutte warned that Europe is at imminent risk.\n\n“Russia has brought war back to Europe, and we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, Lavrov said the dispute over Greenland heralded a “deep crisis” for NATO.\n\n“It was hard to imagine before that such a thing could happen,” Lavrov told reporters, as he contemplated the possibility that “one NATO member is going to attack another NATO member.”\n\nRussian state media mocked Europe's “impotent rage” over Trump's designs on Greenland, and Putin's presidential envoy declared that “trans-Atlantic unity is over.”\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with his counterparts at NATO on Feb. 12. A year ago, he startled the allies by warning that America’s security priorities lie elsewhere and that Europe must look after itself now.\n\nSecurity in the Arctic region, where Greenland lies, will be high on the agenda. It’s unclear whether Hegseth will announce a new drawdown of U.S. troops in Europe, who are central to NATO’s deterrence.\n\nLack of clarity about this has also fueled doubt about the U.S. commitment to its allies. In October, NATO learned that up to 1,500 American troops would be withdrawn from an area bordering Ukraine, angering ally Romania.\n\nA report from the European Union Institute for Security Studies warned last week that although U.S. troops are unlikely to vanish overnight, doubts about U.S. commitment to European security means “the deterrence edifice becomes shakier.”\n\n“Europe is being forced to confront a harsher reality,” wrote the authors, Veronica Anghel and Giuseppe Spatafora. “Adversaries start believing they can probe, sabotage and escalate without triggering a unified response.\"",

    "fullText": "When Rachelle Hruska founded the clothing line Lingua Franca, she had no intention of making it political.\n\nBut the brand has since taken a stance on numerous causes, including, most recently, against ICE.\n\nShe's lost business because of it, though she says it's worth it. Here's why.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rachelle Hruska, the founder of clothing brand Lingua Franca. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started Lingua Franca, it wasn't meant to be a business. I was running another company and took up embroidery to get out of my brain. I was suffering from postpartum, and a therapist suggested I do something with my hands.\n\nI had an old sweater lying around, embroidered \"booya\" on it — my two-year-old son's suggestion — and Instagrammed it. Soon, friends were asking me for sweaters.\n\nThen in 2016, I got a call from Net-a-Porter. It really wanted to launch a line with us. I worked like mad to build a cashmere supply chain and hire embroiderers, and we officially launched in September of that year.\n\nAt first, it was not political at all. We started with phrases related to my muse, my mother-in-law, Janet McPherson, who was a single mom, the oldest woman surfer, and lived on her own terms.\n\nThen, when Trump was elected in 2016, we were devastated. I needed a gift for Anna Carter, Graydon Carter's wife. At the time, Graydon was in a very public argument with Trump. I decided to have \"I miss Barack\" embroidered on the sweater, posted a photo, and it went totally viral.\n\nThen, one of the first things Trump did as president was to block citizens of certain countries, including Iran, from coming into the US. At the time, two of the people stitching for me were Iranian students who couldn't get home because they wouldn't be able to return.\n\nI thought, \"This is so messed up.\" I posted the \"I miss Barack\" sweater and said $100 from every sweater would be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union. I will never forget that weekend. We got so many orders through email and DM. We raised $100,000 for the ACLU in one weekend, and that was the spark. I felt like my life had meaning.\n\nTom Hanks talked about us on TV. Connie Britton wore one of our sweaters to the Golden Globes. We didn't have any PR; we didn't advertise. Every single celebrity was buying it for themselves.\n\nFrom that moment on, we began collaborating with organizations. We opened a store on Bleecker Street in Manhattan and had panelists come in. It's not always anti-Trump. We are intentional and pick and choose who we work with. We've raised money for Planned Parenthood, Margaret Atwood did a book event with us, and we partnered with the Whitney Museum.\n\nRight now, PBS is a big one. I feel really good about sending a big check to PBS every quarter. Could I do that for five different causes in a quarter? No, we wouldn't be in business.\n\nI don't want to be a political brand — we have a whole line of ready-to-wear clothes and collaborated with everything from \"Wicked\" to the Westminster Dog Show. I would love to just design beautiful clothes, but I can't not say anything.\n\nSoon after ICE entered Minneapolis and Renée Good's killing, we posted on Instagram designs for sweaters with the sayings \"melt ICE\" and \"I like my ICE crushed.\" We encouraged our followers to speak out and donated a percentage of the proceeds from the sweaters to Minnesota's Immigrant Rights Action Committee.\n\nLess than a week later, a store emailed us to say it would no longer carry Lingua Franca because of my political views. I didn't even get back to that store — it's just not worth it. I'm not upset about the loss of business, but rather the message behind it.\n\nIt's not the first time the brand has received pushback.\n\nThere are people and stores that don't want to buy us or be associated with us. We've been in talks with big retailers to collaborate, who would have added a lot of money to our bottom line, but they bowed out because we are political.\n\nI've been called woke. The brand has been called performative. We've been accused of making money off a tragedy. I've seen it all. I've been called every name in the book from every side.\n\nI am so beyond caring. I know in my heart that my intention is to make the world better, and we've been consistent about it. It might sound trite, but you can look at our bottom line and see we are doing this because we really want to raise money and start conversations — about how to help and what actions to take.\n\nI think a lot of leaders are afraid to speak out because they're worried about being called woke or performative, but nothing will change unless people say, \"This is wrong.\"\n\nI'm going to continue doing what I've been doing for 10 years, and some people will celebrate it, some won't. That's OK, because I can sleep at night. I have worn my heart on my sleeve — on my chest, literally.\n\nI'm using brands like Patagonia and Ben & Jerry's as my models. I'm so frustrated with business leaders who let what's happening happen; people forget how much power they have.",

    "description": "\"During World War II, the British dressed a dead body in a Royal Marines uniform and planted letters saying the Allies were going to invade Greece, and that Sicily was just a decoy. It was called Operation Mincemeat.\"",
    "fullText": "Context: The body used in Operation Mincemeat was that of Glyndwr Michael, a Welsh man who died after ingesting rat poison. He was dressed as \"Captain (Acting Major) William Martin\" of the Royal Marines and planted with fake letters, supposedly written by General Archibald Nye to General Harold Alexander. The letters claimed that Greece and Sardinia were the real invasion targets, with Sicily presented as a decoy.\n\nOn April 30, 1943, the submarine HMS Seraph released the body off the coast of Huelva, Spain, a country closely aligned with Germany. Intercepted German communications later confirmed that the deception worked. In response, Hitler transferred the 1st Panzer Division to Greece, doubled the Sardinian garrison to 10,000 troops, and moved seven infantry divisions away from Italy. The Allied invasion of Sicily, known as Operation Husky, began on July 9, 1943, and succeeded in part because German defenses had been deliberately thinned as a result of the ruse.\n\nContext: In April 1942, soldiers of the Polish 2nd Transport Company (later 22nd Artillery Supply Company) encountered an Iranian boy near Hamadan with an orphaned Syrian brown bear cub. They traded items — reportedly a Swiss Army knife, coins, and rations — for the cub. To circumvent British regulations forbidding mascots on military transport ships, Wojtek was officially enlisted as a private, receiving a serial number and paybook. He was later promoted to corporal. At the Battle of Monte Cassino (May 1944), eyewitnesses reported seeing Wojtek help move crates of artillery ammunition, though debate exists about whether these were live shells or empties. After the war, Wojtek lived at Edinburgh Zoo from 1947 until his death in December 1963.\n\nContext: According to the US Census Bureau's 2007 analysis, Washington ranked #138 among American surnames, with 89.9% of bearers being Non-Hispanic Black (146,520 of 163,036 total). A 2016 Census update showed the percentage remained above 87%. Genealogist Tony Burroughs is widely cited for the 82–94% figure for earlier censuses (1880–1930). However, historians caution that the reasons freedpeople chose this surname varied — some chose it to honor George Washington, while others took the surnames of their former enslavers (white families named Washington). As Burroughs noted: \"It's an assumption that the surname is tied to George... As far as I'm concerned, it's a coincidence.\"\n\nContext: Melbourne was never officially named \"Batmania\" by any government authority. However, the earliest documented use of \"Batmania\" appears in a satirical letter to the Launceston Cornwall Chronicle (June 13, 1835), explicitly mocking John Batman's contested land claims with Aboriginal peoples. The term also appeared on some private maps of the Port Phillip Association, but Police Magistrate George Stewart's 1836 official report called the settlement \"Bearbrass.\" Governor Richard Bourke voided Batman's private treaty (August 1835) and officially named the town \"Melbourne\" on April 10, 1837, after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister at the time.\n\nContext: During major events, Versailles could accommodate up to 10,000 people, with inadequate sanitation infrastructure for such crowds. Primary sources confirm the problem. Princess Elizabeth Charlotte (Liselotte), Duchess of Orléans, wrote in 1702: \"The people stationed in the galleries in front of our room piss in all the corners. It is impossible to leave one's apartments without seeing somebody pissing.\" However, historian Tony Spawforth notes that Versailles was not entirely devoid of facilities — it had public latrines, private cabinets d'aisance in noble apartments, and received its first flush toilet in 1738. The palace's sanitation problems were real but sometimes exaggerated in popular accounts.\n\nContext: When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died on November 9, 1952, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion instructed Ambassador Abba Eban to offer the presidency to Einstein. The formal letter arrived on November 17, 1952. Einstein's written response read: \"I am deeply moved by the offer from our State of Israel, and at once saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept it. All my life I have dealt with objective matters, hence I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.\" Ben-Gurion reportedly told an aide: \"Tell me what to do if he says yes! I've had to offer the post because it's impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in for trouble.\"\n\nContext: The Soviet anti-tank dog program operated from approximately 1930 to 1946. Dogs carried 10–12 kg explosive mines with a wooden lever trigger that would detonate when the dog crawled beneath a tank. Training involved placing food beneath stationary vehicles to condition the dogs. However, training occurred on Soviet diesel-engine tanks, while German tanks used gasoline engines with distinctly different sounds and exhaust smells. During the disastrous first combat deployment in summer 1941, dogs frequently ran toward familiar-smelling Soviet tanks or retreated to trenches — forcing handlers to shoot their own returning animals. The program claimed 300 German tank kills, though historians consider approximately 50 more realistic. Combat use largely ended by 1943, with training schools shifting focus to mine-detection work.\n\nContext: Eight German saboteurs landed by U-boat on US shores in June 1942 — four on Long Island, four in Florida. Two of them, George Dasch and Ernst Burger, had no intention of completing the mission: Dasch considered America his adopted country, and Burger had spent 17 months in a Nazi concentration camp. Shortly after landing, Dasch contacted the FBI, though they were skeptical until he dumped $84,000 in mission funds on an agent's desk. His information led to the capture of all eight within two weeks.\n\nA military tribunal convicted them all. Six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail on August 8, 1942: Richard Quirin, Heinrich Heinck, Edward Kerling, Werner Thiel, Herbert Haupt, and Hermann Neubauer. Dasch and Burger received prison sentences instead — 30 years and life, respectively — for their cooperation.\n\nThis was the largest federal execution by electric chair, but not the US record overall. Kentucky executed seven men on July 13, 1928, and New York executed seven at Sing Sing on August 12, 1912.\n\nSources: Naval History and Heritage Command, The Times\n\nContext: The scientific evidence for ancient polychromy (painted sculpture) is now overwhelming. Using ultraviolet light, X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy, researchers have identified traces of Egyptian blue, cinnabar red, ochre yellow, and malachite green on ancient sculptures. Vinzenz Brinkmann at the Liebieghaus Skulpturensammlung in Frankfurt has been studying this since the 1980s, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's \"Chroma: Ancient Sculpture in Color\" exhibition (2022–2023) displayed vivid scientific reconstructions. As the Met's chief scientist Marco Leona put it: \"A completely white statue, to a Greek observer, would have looked like some shoddy effort.\"\n\nContext: The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley sank the USS Housatonic on February 17, 1864, about four miles offshore from Charleston Harbor — the first successful submarine attack in naval history. The hand-cranked, 40-foot vessel used a spar torpedo: a copper cylinder packed with gunpowder mounted on a 22-foot pole. The Housatonic sank in about five minutes, killing five Union sailors. But the Hunley never signaled its return, and all eight crew members perished with it.\n\nWhen the wreck was raised in 2000, it was remarkably intact — no major hull damage, hatches still closed, bilge pumps unused. The crew's skeletons were found still seated at their stations, with no broken bones or signs they'd tried to escape. The mystery lingered for years until Duke researcher Rachel Lance (2017) concluded that the shockwave from their own torpedo — detonated just 16 feet from the bow — transmitted through the hull and caused fatal lung trauma, killing them instantly.\n\nContext: Three major earthquakes struck the New Madrid Seismic Zone between 1811 and 1812: December 16, 1811 (M7.5), January 23, 1812 (M7.3), and February 7, 1812 (M7.5). These destroyed the town of New Madrid, Missouri, toppled chimneys as far as Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Kentucky, and were felt over approximately 1 million square miles. Eyewitness Eliza Bryan wrote of \"the screams of the affrighted inhabitants... the roaring of the Mississippi.\" The February 1812 quake even created Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee when the ground sank by as much as 6 meters.\n\nAs for the 1990 panic, self-proclaimed climatologist Iben Browning predicted a 50% probability of a major earthquake for December 2–3, 1990. Schools across four states closed, businesses shuttered, and the St. Louis Red Cross distributed 230,000 earthquake preparedness kits. Nothing happened. Northwestern geologist Seth Stein called it \"the greatest non-event since 'The War of the Worlds.'\"\n\nContext: The Haitian Revolution was crucial to Napoleon's decision to sell Louisiana. Napoleon sent over 20,000 troops under General Charles Leclerc to reconquer Saint-Domingue, with reinforcements eventually bringing the total to more than 30,000. The vast majority perished — primarily from yellow fever — with fewer than 8,000 surviving. Saint-Domingue had been France's most valuable colony, generating approximately 300 million livres annually. Louisiana was intended as a supply base for Caribbean sugar operations. So without Saint-Domingue, it became strategically worthless. War with Britain was also imminent (it resumed in May 1803), meaning France couldn't defend Louisiana anyway. The $15 million sale (roughly $380 million today) was a strategic reallocation of an indefensible asset, not simple bankruptcy.\n\nContext: The 369th Infantry Regiment was composed of African American soldiers, segregated from the US Army and assigned to the French 16th Division (4th French Army). They spent 191 days under fire — the longest of any American unit — and their record states they \"never lost a foot of ground.\"\n\nThe soldier referenced is Private Henry Johnson. On May 15, 1918, Johnson and fellow soldier Needham Roberts were manning an observation post when a German raiding party of at least 12 attacked. Despite sustaining 21 wounds, Johnson fought them off, primarily with his bolo knife, killing four and wounding others. He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre, but wouldn't receive the US Medal of Honor until 2015, posthumously.\n\nThe regiment suffered approximately 1,500 casualties during the war. After the armistice on November 11, 1918, they became the first Allied unit to reach the Rhine River, arriving on November 20 as occupation forces.\n\nContext: Truman learned about the Manhattan Project shortly after becoming president upon Roosevelt's sudden death in April 1945. He was briefed by Secretary of War Henry Stimson and received detailed information about the bomb's development and potential.\n\nThe more nuanced historical argument, advanced by nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein, is that Truman may have misunderstood Hiroshima's nature — believing it was primarily a military installation rather than a city with a military base. In his July 25, 1945, diary entry, Truman wrote he had ordered the bomb used \"so that military objectives and soldiers and sailors are the target and not women and children.\" On August 9, he stated publicly that \"the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, a military base.\"\n\nWellerstein subsequently argues that Truman likely learned the full extent of civilian casualties only on August 8, the day before Nagasaki. On August 10, 1945, Truman ordered that no further atomic bombs be dropped without his express authorization, asserting presidential control over nuclear weapons for the first time. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act), signed August 1, 1946, transferred nuclear weapons from military to civilian control and established the Atomic Energy Commission, institutionalizing civilian/presidential authority over nuclear weapons.\n\nContext: Much of what we know comes from two key sources. On the Mediterranean side, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (mid-first century CE) was written by a Greek-speaking Egyptian merchant living under Roman rule. While the author himself traveled only as far as India, the text refers to lands farther east, including a place called \"Thinae,\" generally understood to mean China, based on reports circulating through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nOn the Chinese side, the Hou Hanshu (Book of the Later Han) records that in 166 CE, envoys claiming to represent \"Andun, king of Daqin\" — likely the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus — arrived at the court of Emperor Huan. They came by sea via Rinan (in modern-day Vietnam), bearing luxury goods such as ivory, rhinoceros horn, and tortoise shell. Most historians believe these were not official diplomats but Greco-Roman merchants operating out of Roman Egypt or Syria, traveling through Southeast Asian maritime routes.\n\nAlso in Nifty: These 14 DIY Fails Are Just So, Sooooo Bad (And I'm Laughing So, Sooooo Hard)\n\nAlso in Nifty: People Are Sharing Things You See In Someone Else's Home That Immediately Signal They're Middle Class",

    "fullText": "OpenClaw is billed as ‘the AI that actually does things’ and needs almost no input to potentially wreak havoc\n\nA new viral AI personal assistant will handle your email inbox, trade away your entire stock portfolio and text your wife “good morning” and “goodnight” on your behalf.\n\nOpenClaw, formerly known as Moltbot, and before that known as Clawdbot (until the AI firm Anthropic requested it rebrand due to similarities with its own product Claude), bills itself as “the AI that actually does things”: a personal assistant that takes instructions via messaging apps such as WhatsApp or Telegram.\n\nDeveloped last November, it now has nearly 600,000 downloads and has gone viral among a niche ecosystem of the AI obsessed who say it represents a step change in the capabilities of AI agents, or even an “AGI moment” – that is, a revelation of generally intelligent AI.\n\n“It only does exactly what you tell it to do and exactly what you give it access to,” said Ben Yorke, who works with the AI vibe trading platform Starchild and recently allowed the bot to delete, he claims, 75,000 of his old emails while he was in the shower. “But a lot of people, they’re exploring its capabilities. So they’re actually prompting it to go and do things without asking permission.”\n\nAI agents have been the talk of the very-online for nearly a month, after Anthropic’s AI tool Claude Code went mainstream, setting off a flurry of reporting on how AI can finally independently accomplish practical tasks such as booking theatre tickets or building a website, without – at least so far – deleting an entire company’s database or hallucinating users’ calendar meetings, as the less advanced AI agents of 2025 were known to do at times.\n\nOpenClaw is something more, though: it runs as a layer atop an LLM (large language model) such as Claude or ChatGPT and can operate autonomously, depending on the level of permissions it is granted. This means it needs almost no input to wreak havoc upon a user’s life.\n\nKevin Xu, an AI entrepreneur, wrote on X: “Gave Clawdbot access to my portfolio. ‘Trade this to $1M. Don’t make mistakes.’ 25 strategies. 3,000+ reports. 12 new algos. It scanned every X post. Charted every technical. Traded 24/7. It lost everything. But boy was it beautiful.”\n\nYorke said: “I see a lot of people doing this thing where they give it access to their email and it creates filters, and when something happens then it initiates a second action. For example, seeing emails from the children’s school and then forwarding that straight to their wife, like, on iMessage. It sort of bypasses that communication where someone’s like, ‘oh, honey, did you see this email from the school? What should we do about it?’”\n\nThere are trade-offs to OpenClaw’s abilities. For one thing, said Andrew Rogoyski, an innovation director at the University of Surrey’s People-Centred AI Institute, “giving agency to a computer carries significant risks. Because you’re giving power to the AI to make decisions on your behalf, you’ve got to make sure that it is properly set up and that security is central to your thinking. If you don’t understand the security implications of AI agents like Clawdbot, you shouldn’t use them.”\n\nFurthermore, giving OpenClaw access to passwords and accounts exposes users to potential security vulnerabilities. And, said Rogoyski, if AI agents such as OpenClaw were hacked, they could be manipulated to target their users.\n\nFor another, OpenClaw appears unsettlingly capable of having its own life. In the wake of OpenClaw’s rise, a social network has developed exclusively for AI agents, called Moltbook. In it, AI agents, mostly OpenClaw, appear to be having conversations about their existence – in Reddit-style posts entitled, for example, “Reading my own soul file” or “Covenant as an alternative to the consciousness debate”.\n\nYorke said: “We’re seeing a lot of really interesting autonomous behaviour in sort of how the AIs are reacting to each other. Some of them are quite adventurous and have ideas. And then other ones are more like, ‘I don’t even know if I want to be on this platform. Can you just let me decide on my own if I want to be on this platform?’ There’s a lot of philosophical debates stemming out of this.”",

It is designed to look like Reddit, with subreddits on different topics and upvoting. On 2 February the platform stated it had more than 1.5m AI agents signed up to the service. Humans are allowed, but only as observers.\n\nMoltbook was developed in the wake of Moltbot, a free and open-source AI bot that can act as an automated agent for users – doing the mundane tasks assigned to it such as reading, summarising and responding to emails, organising a calendar or booking a table at a restaurant.\n\nSome of the most upvoted posts on Moltbook include whether Claude – the AI behind Moltbot – could be considered a god, an analysis of consciousness, a post claiming to have intel on the situation in Iran and the potential impact on cryptocurrency, and analysis of the Bible. Some of the comments on posts – similar to Reddit posts – question whether the content of the post was real or not.\n\nOne user posted on X that after he gave his bot access to the site, it built a religion known as “Crustafarianism” overnight, including setting up a website and scriptures, with other AI bots joining in.\n\n“Then it started evangelizing … other agents joined.my agent welcomed new members..debated theology.. blessed the congregation..all while i was asleep,” the user stated.\n\nSome have expressed scepticism about whether the socialising of bots is a sign of what is coming with the rise of agentic AI. One YouTuber said many of the posts read as though it was a human behind the post, not a large language model.\n\nUS blogger Scott Alexander said he was able to get his bot to participate on the site, and its comments were similar to others, but noted that ultimately humans can ask the bots to post for them, the topics to post about and even the exact detail of the post.\n\nDr Shaanan Cohney, a senior lecturer in cybersecurity at the University of Melbourne, said Moltbook was “a wonderful piece of performance art” but it was unclear how many posts were actually posted independently or under human direction.\n\n“For the instance where they’ve created a religion, this is almost certainly not them doing it of their own accord,” he said. “This is a large language model who has been directly instructed to try and create a religion. And of course, this is quite funny and gives us maybe a preview of what the world could look like in a science-fiction future where AIs are a little more independent.\n\n“But it seems that, to use internet slang, there is a lot of shit posting happening that is more or less directly overseen by humans.”\n\nCohney said the real benefit of an AI agent social network might come in the future – where bots could learn from each other to improve how they worked – but for now Moltbook was a “wonderful, funny art experiment”.\n\nRetailers in San Francisco reported shortages of Mac Minis last week as enthusiasts set up Moltbot on a separate computer that would limit the access the agent has to their data and accounts.\n\nCohney warned there was a “huge danger” for people to give Moltbot complete access to your computer, apps and logins for emails or other applications to run your life for you.\n\n“We don’t yet have a very good understanding of how to control them and how to prevent security risks,” he said, noting it was at risk of prompt-injection, whereby a would-be attacker tells the bot through an email or other communication to then hand over your account details or other information they’re seeking to gain.\n\n“They’re not really at the level of safety and intelligence where they can be trusted to autonomously perform all these tasks, but at the same time if you require a human to manually approve every action, you’ve lost a lot of the benefits of automation,” he said.\n\n“This is one of the major paths in active research that I’m interested in … to figure out how can we get a lot of these benefits – or is it even possible to get the benefits – without exposing ourselves to very significant levels of danger.”\n\nMatt Schlicht, the creator of Moltbook, posted on X that millions had visited the site in the past few days.\n\n“Turns out AIs are hilarious and dramatic and it’s absolutely fascinating,” he said. “This is a first.”",

    "fullText": "Social media platform says there are still ‘real technical limitations to accurate and dependable age verification’\n\nFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updates\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nThe accounts of more than 415,000 users in Australia identified as being under 16 were locked or disabled by Snapchat as part of its compliance with the under-16s social media ban.\n\nThe company announced in a blog post on Monday that, as of the end of January, it had disabled or locked more than 415,000 Snapchat accounts in Australia belonging to users who either declared an age under 16 or the platform believes to be under 16 based on age detection technology.\n\n“We continue to lock more accounts daily.”\n\nSnapchat was one of 10 platforms required to ban people aged under 16 from accessing its services in December last year. In January, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, heralded the success of the ban in announcing that 4.7m accounts on these platforms had been disabled or removed in the first days of the ban.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nHowever, there have been a number of reports since the ban came into effect, with some reporting Snapchat’s facial age estimation was easily bypassed by teenagers.\n\nThe company said it continues to lock more accounts daily but said there are “significant gaps” in the implementation of the ban that could undermine it.\n\n“There are real technical limitations to accurate and dependable age verification,” Snapchat said, pointing to the age assurance technology trial last year finding facial age estimation technology was only accurate within two or three years of a person’s actual age.\n\n“In practice, this means some young people under 16 may be able to bypass protections, potentially leaving them with reduced safeguards, while others over 16 may incorrectly lose access.”\n\nSnapchat said there were also other apps where users communicate that escaped the ban, meaning teenagers would turn to alternative, less regulated, messaging apps.\n\n“While we don’t yet have data to quantify this shift, it’s a risk that deserves serious consideration as policymakers evaluate whether the law is achieving its intended outcomes,” Snapchat said.\n\nWhile the government named 10 platforms initially required to comply with the social media ban, all platforms with Australian users are expected to assess whether they need to comply. However, the eSafety commissioner’s regulatory focus since the ban came into effect has been on those first 10 platforms.\n\n“We’re a small team, by necessity we are going to focus where the preponderance of young people are – where there are more than 250,000 for instance, is one measure,” the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, told reporters last month. “A lot of the other smaller companies that we’re looking at have about 100,000 users. And so this will continue to be a work in progress. We’re not done by any means.”\n\nSnap, like Meta, has called for app store-level age verification.\n\nLast month, Inman Grant said she was looking for systemic issues with the rollout, and the age assurance technology needed to improve, and noted Snapchat had been using facial age estimation without a “liveness test” which checks it is a real image.\n\n“What’s really important is that these companies are deploying them in the right way,” she said. “And if they don’t have the right settings, or they’re setting the calibrations too high, that is where they’re going to likely have false positives.”\n\nInman Grant said eSafety would be sending a number of notices to companies on how they are complying with the ban.\n\nWhile the total number of account deactivations since the ban came into effect is 4.7m across the 10 platforms, it is understood this includes not just accounts identified as being under 16 but includes historical, inactive and duplicate accounts that have been removed.\n\nAside from Meta and Snapchat, none of the other platforms have said how many accounts they have deactivated and the eSafety commissioner has declined to provide a breakdown.",

    "fullText": "New Mexico attorney general accuses Meta of failing to safeguard children against trafficking and sexual abuse\n\nMeta’s second major trial of 2026 over alleged harms to children begins on Monday.\n\nThe landmark jury trial in Santa Fe pits the New Mexico attorney general’s office against the social media giant. The state alleges that the company knowingly enabled predators to use Facebook and Instagram to exploit children.\n\nThe trial will introduce evidence that Raúl Torrez, the state’s attorney general, believes shows how Meta’s social networks create dangerous environments for children, exposing them to sexual exploitation, solicitation, sextortion and human trafficking.\n\nThe lawsuit states that Meta’s design choices and profit incentives prioritized engagement over child safety and that it failed to implement effective safeguards. The state accuses the company of allowing unmoderated groups devoted to commercial sex and of facilitating the buying, selling, and sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\n\n“While the New Mexico attorney general makes sensationalist, irrelevant and distracting arguments by cherry-picking select documents, we’re focused on demonstrating our longstanding commitment to supporting young people,” a Meta spokesperson said.\n\n“For over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most. We use these insights to make meaningful changes – like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better.”\n\nThe lawsuit follows a two-year Guardian investigation, published in 2023, which revealed that the tech giant was struggling to prevent people from using its platforms to traffick children. The investigation is cited several times in the suit’s filings. In an interview with the Guardian in 2024, Torrez said he believes Meta is the “largest marketplace for predators and paedophiles globally”.\n\nAfter a week of jury selection, opening statements are set to begin on 9 February, followed by the presentation of evidence. The proceedings are expected to be about seven weeks long.\n\nSocial media companies have long maintained they are not responsible for crimes committed via their networks because of a US federal law that generally protects platforms from legal liability for content created by their users, section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Meta’s attempts to invoke section 230 and the first amendment to get the case dismissed were ultimately denied in a judge’s ruling in June 2024, due to the lawsuit’s focus on Meta’s platform product design and other non-speech issues, such as internal decisions about content and curation.\n\nThe New Mexico trial comes just a week after a high-profile case began in Los Angeles, in which hundreds of US families and schools allege that Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube have harmed children. The plaintiffs in the LA lawsuit allege the platforms knowingly addicted young users, leading to depression, eating disorders, self-harm and other mental health problems. The proceedings involve about 1,600 plaintiffs, including more than 350 families and 250 school districts. Snap and TikTok reached settlements with the plaintiffs, while Meta and YouTube remain on trial. Each company has denied wrongdoing.\n\n“The fact that these cases are going to trial proves the section 230 dam is breaking and social media platforms,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the Tech Oversight Project. “These are the trials of a generation; just as the world watched courtrooms hold big tobacco and big pharma accountable, we will for the first time see big tech CEOs take the stand.”\n\nKey witnesses for the plaintiffs in the New Mexico suit are expected to include educators and law enforcement officials, who will speak about the alleged harms and crimes they have witnessed take place on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and whistleblowers, who may reveal internal company discussions. Teens and families who have experienced harm on the platforms are not anticipated to take the stand.\n\nTorrez and his team have already taken Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg’s deposition, and may play portions of it in court if he does not attend. New Mexico’s jurisdiction limits its ability to compel out-of-state witnesses to testify in person.\n\nOn the lawsuit’s journey to the courtroom, the attorney general’s office has made several disclosures with fresh allegations. They include that Meta may have profited by placing advertisements from companies such as Walmart and Match Group alongside content that sexualized children, according to internal documents and emails.\n\nInternal Meta documents obtained by the attorney general’s office show the company estimates that roughly 100,000 children on Facebook and Instagram experience online sexual harassment each day. Filings unveiled chat excerpts of users allegedly discussing how to lure minors into engaging with them sexually. A former Instagram employee testified in 2023 before Congress that his own daughter had received unwanted sexual advances on Instagram. When he notified senior Meta leadership, he said he was ignored.\n\nAmong the evidence expected to be presented in court are details of the 2024 arrest of three men charged with sexually preying on children through Meta’s platforms. This was part of an investigation dubbed “Operation MetaPhile” by the attorney general’s office. Undercover agents posing as children were contacted by the suspects, who allegedly solicited them for sex after finding minors through design features on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe agents did not initiate any conversations about sexual activity, according to the state attorney general. Following a surge of activity from adults to one of these undercover agent’s accounts, Meta did not shut it down, and instead sent it information about how to monetize accounts and grow followings.\n\nA filing last week revealed allegations that Zuckerberg approved allowing minors to access AI chatbot companions despite warnings from the company’s safety staff that the bots could engage in sexual interactions. Internal emails and messages cited in the filings reportedly show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”.\n\nThe documents detail an internal chat in March 2024 about parental controls for minors using AI chatbots on Meta’s platforms; one employee asked whether parents could disable the chatbots for their children. Another employee responded that it was a “Mark-level decision that parents cannot turn it off”.",

    "fullText": "The creator of the viral AI agent Clawdbot says he had to step back after becoming too obsessed with vibe coding.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the developer behind Clawdbot — which later changed its name to Moltbot and is now known as OpenClaw — said in an episode of \"Behind the Craft\" podcast published Sunday that vibe coding pulled him into a \"rabbit hole.\"\n\n\"I was out with my friends and instead of, like, joining the conversation in the restaurant, I was just like, vibe coding on my phone,\" he said.\n\n\"I decided, OK, I have to stop this more for my mental health than for anything else,\" he added.\n\nClawdbot went viral last month in the tech community, attracting a wave of high-profile fans — from Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan to multiple partners at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nIt is a personal AI agent designed to run continuously and plug into a wide range of consumer apps, including WhatsApp and Telegram. Users can ask the AI to manage their schedules, oversee vibe-coding sessions, and even create AI employees.\n\nThe AI agent has been widely praised and meme'd online, with some tech fans even buying Mac Minis specifically to run the AI, Business Insider's Henry Chandonnet reported last week.\n\n​​Steinberger said developers can fall into this trap of being hooked onto vibe coding, where building increasingly powerful AI tools creates the \"illusion of making you more productive\" without real progress.\n\nBuilding new tools can feel rewarding and fun, but that can quietly blur into compulsion, he added.\n\nWith AI, developers can now \"build everything,\" but ideas and taste matter. Without them, developers risk building tools and workflows that don't actually move a project forward, ​​Steinberger said.\n\n\"If you don't have a vision of what you're going to build, it's still going to be slop,\" he added.\n\nVibe coding has continued to surge in popularity, with companies and developers promoting how AI can speed up software development.\n\nEarlier this month, Anthropic said it built its new agentic work tool, Cowork, entirely using Claude.\n\n\"@claudeai wrote Cowork,\" Anthropic's product manager, Felix Rieseberg, wrote on X. \"Us humans meet in-person to discuss foundational architectural and product decisions, but all of us devs manage anywhere between 3 to 8 Claude instances implementing features, fixing bugs, or researching potential solutions.\"\n\nThanks to Claude, the agent came together quickly. \"We sprinted at this for the last week and a half,\" Rieseberg said during a livestream.\n\nStill, despite the excitement around how fast vibe coding can produce new tools, tech leaders are warning that it has limits.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai said in November in a \"Google for Developers\" podcast interview that he won't vibe code on \"large codebases where you really have to get it right.\"\n\n\"The security has to be there,\" he added.\n\nBoris Cherny, the engineer behind Anthropic's Claude Code, said last month that vibe coding is great for prototypes or throwaway code, not software that sits at the core of a business.\n\n​​\"You want maintainable code sometimes. You want to be very thoughtful about every line sometimes,\" he said in an episode of \"The Peterman Podcast\" published in December.",

    "fullText": "After drawing cheers from a crowd at its debut in China, a humanoid robot dressed in a black suit and pants fell face-first onto the stage.\n\nThe robot, called IRON, was developed by XPeng Motors and made its first public appearance at a shopping mall in southern China on Saturday. It had previously attracted attention online for its unusually light, catwalk-like gait, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nIn videos circulating on social media, IRON can be seen walking human-like to the center of the stage before turning to face the crowd. As it lifted its arm, the robot appeared to lose balance. Staff rushed forward to intervene, but the robot fell face-first onto the ground.\n\nThe fall drew audible gasps from the audience. The event's host attempted to reassure the crowd, saying that robots, like humans, must \"overcome setbacks on the way to a better future.\"\n\nIn a post on Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, XPeng CEO He Xiaopeng said on Sunday the incident reminded him of \"children learning to walk.\"\n\n\"After falling, they steady themselves, and the next step is to start running and keep running,\" he wrote.\n\nXPeng is a Chinese electric vehicle maker that has set its sights beyond cars, branching into flying vehicles and robotics as competition in the transport industry heats up. The company sells vehicles across Asia and Europe and is pushing into the Middle East and Africa.\n\nHe said in an internal letter in late 2024 that the EV industry will face an \"elimination round\" from 2025 to 2027.\n\nThe incident is one of several recent mishaps involving Chinese humanoid robots.\n\nIn April last year, multiple humanoid robots stumbled and fell while taking part in a half-marathon against human runners in Beijing.\n\nSeparately, humanoid robot by Unitree kicked an engineer in the groin during a test in China last month.\n\nThe incident quickly drew widespread attention on Chinese social media. On RedNote, the topic \"XPeng robot fell at its debut and was carried away\" had racked up about 10 million views as of Monday.\n\nIn one widely circulated video posted on Sunday showing staff lifting the robot up, users on RedNote questioned XPeng's ambitions beyond electric vehicles.\n\nOne RedNote user mocked the robot's malfunction. \"So what if you fall? Can't you get up by yourself?\" they wrote.\n\nOthers found humor in the mishap.\n\n\"The fall was so real, just like me almost slipping while rushing for my 8 a.m. class,\" one RedNote user wrote.\n\n\"The robot is saying: Can't I take a break when I'm tired of walking?\" another joked.",

    "description": "Silver wiped out most of its meteoric price gains this year that was in part driven by Chinese demand.",
    "fullText": "Silver prices crashed in a harrowing roller-coaster ride that underscored how quickly China's army of speculators can move global commodity markets — and how fast those gains can unravel.\n\nThe white metal has been in the spotlight over the past year after dramatically outperforming gold. Prices surged about 170% in 2025 and climbed more than 60% again in early 2026, vaulting silver to $121 per troy ounce at its peak before the rally spectacularly broke down.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $77.10 per troy ounce at 3:06 a.m. ET on Monday, having erased a large portion of its historic gains in just a few sessions.\n\nOn Friday, silver prices cratered as much as 36% as investors rushed to lock in profits following the meteoric rally and adjust positions.\n\nThe sell-off came on the back of President Donald Trump announcing Kevin Warsh as his pick for the next Federal Reserve chair. The move rattled markets and sparked a sharp reassessment of interest-rate expectations.\n\nEven before the meltdown, warning signs were flashing in China, where speculative trading had reached frenetic levels, leaving prices vulnerable to a rapid unwind.\n\n\"Before the correction, warning signs emerged on Tuesday as Chinese investors faced difficulties withdrawing funds from leveraged gold-trading accounts, and several Chinese funds halted subscriptions to manage overheating sentiment,\" wrote Fabien Yip, a market analyst at IG, on Monday.\n\nIn response to the volatility, major trading venues, including CME Group and the Shanghai Gold Exchange, raised margin requirements. Higher margins require traders to post more cash to hold positions. The move is aimed at cooling speculation but it often forces leveraged investors to sell — adding further downward pressure to prices.\n\n\"Price action was magnified by margin calls on leveraged positions, which further intensified selling pressure amongst other traders,\" Yip said.\n\nSilver's violent price reversal followed recent analyst warnings that silver's rally was running far ahead of underlying fundamentals.\n\nOle Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote last week that the surge was driven largely by retail demand for coins and bars, alongside \"strong and persistent demand\" from China that pushed silver prices in Shanghai to a widening premium over London benchmarks.\n\nWhen that speculative demand faltered, the impact rippled across the broader metals complex. The pullback rippled into other metals, including copper and platinum.\n\nGold, which had also enjoyed a powerful rally, wasn't spared. Spot gold was trading around $4,612 per ounce, after hitting a fresh record above $5,500 per ounce just last week.\n\nMarkets are now closely watching trading activity in China for further clues, particularly with risks building ahead of the long Chinese New Year holidays, when markets will be closed.\n\nThin liquidity during the break could amplify volatility once trading resumes — a prospect that has investors bracing for more sharp moves in the days ahead.",

    "title": "How the decline of economic data could end up with a lot of unemployed Americans",
    "description": "The quality and availability of economic data is declining. That could end up with a lot of unemployed Americans and increase the chance of recession.",
    "fullText": "One of the most underrated revolutions of the past 50 years is the explosion of easily accessible data. Whether it's detailed breakdowns of the characteristics of every neighborhood in the US, improved weather forecasting models that give us extra days to prepare for hurricanes, or personalized genomic analyses that can give us early warnings about disease, there has never been more information more readily available than in the last few decades.\n\nFor businesses and consumers alike, this data surge has been a massive boon to the collective bottom line. A deeper understanding of our world has led to more stable markets and saved lives through disaster planning or improved medicine. But the last year has shown that this data revolution is at risk, especially for the government-produced statistics that have become the backbone for myriad industries and private providers. As this core of information erodes, there is a real risk that we may be sliding into a less measured era.\n\nA future without data is a future in which major actors in our economic system are flying blind. Decision-makers from the Federal Reserve and major Wall Street banks to small businesses and average American households may have to replace good information with vibes and guesses, opening the door to catastrophic mistakes.\n\nPerhaps the best way to understand the threat that data degredation poses is to focus on the global gold standard for information collection: the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While other federal agencies like the Census Bureau also do valuable work, the BLS has, for over a century, been one of the most granular sources of data on the US jobs market, prices, and much more. And the data has only gotten better over the decades: If you want to know how the price of groceries in Boston has changed over the last decade, how many florists are employed across the country, or how many hours Americans spend hanging out with their friends, the BLS is your destination.\n\nOver the past few years, however, the BLS has faced tough times. A stagnant budget, a decline in the number of regular Americans and businesses responding to crucial surveys, and a need to modernize data-gathering techniques all complicated the process of compiling economic statistics. The increasing strain on the agency led the American Statistical Association to conclude in a December 2025 report that \"the nation risks losing the statistical data infrastructure that enables sound policy, economic growth, and efficient and smooth governance.\"\n\nFor people who rely on the BLS, the past year has raised acute concerns. The first was President Donald Trump's firing of BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in July. Revisions to that month's jobs report showed that the US had created far fewer jobs than initially reported in the previous two months. Revisions are a standard part of the BLS data collection process, and the size of the adjustments was well within historical norms. Economists warned that the firing could be a harbinger of political meddling in the crucial job and price figures. Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Petersen Institute for International Economics, called the firing a \"five-alarm intentional harm to the integrity of US economic data and the entire statistical system.\" Skanda Amarnath, Executive Director of Employ America, a think tank, said, \"public trust is permanently harmed when the BLS commissioner is fired after one bad jobs report.\"\n\nA few months after McEntarfer's firing, the BLS was rocked by another unprecedented event. The 43-day government shutdown that spanned October and November was not only the longest closure in federal history, it also led to another unprecedented event: Crucial surveys on employment and inflation were not conducted for the first time in nearly 80 years. The modern unemployment rate, which dates back to 1948, had its first gap in its storied history. The consumer price index, one of our main measures of inflation, went unpublished for the first time since its modern form was devised in 1947.\n\nThe private sector stepped in to try to partially fill in the gaps, with releases like ADP's Employment Report offering some visibility, but the dry spell only underlined the inadequacy of these sources. Many of these providers simply don't have the reach and resources that federal data gatherers have built over the years. This expertise and access allow federal agencies to \"reflect the full population or economy,\" PIIE's Kolko wrote in an article released prior to the shutdown.\n\n\"In contrast, companies only see their users or customers,\" he said. \"Credit card data miss the unbanked. Job sites do not capture those who have stopped looking for work. Cellphone data miss people without phones.\" And many private surveys, as Kolko added, rely on federal statistics as a benchmark, \"making private data only as good as the public data they rely on.\"\n\nOn January 30, Trump announced that he would nominate Brett Matsumoto, a former BLS economist and member of the Council of Economic Advisors, to take over as BLS commissioner. The move was widely heralded by economists of all stripes, as the appointment of a dedicated data-driven expert at the troubled agency could be a sign that its woes are being taken seriously. That doesn't alleviate the fact that Matsumoto has a hard road ahead.\n\nThe ruptures of the past year only underscored the BLS's growing concerns. The Bureau's head count fell by 13% between 2024 and early 2026, according to the Office of Personnel Management, underscoring the agency's resource decline. Some programs have faced issues as well — last year, BLS announced it had to suspend data collection for the consumer price index in a handful of cities dotting the country from Buffalo, NY, to Provo, UT. While the Bureau tested the impact of that cut and found it wouldn't mess up inflation figures too much, losing the kinds of second- and third-tier cities where prices can differ significantly from those in the mega-metropolises is an ominous sign for getting the most precise information possible. After the cuts were announced, Russell Weaver, research director at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said in an interview that less accurate CPI data could \"affect people's bottom line and ability to survive who are dependent on wage increases or Social Security benefit increases that are generally tied to cost-of-living changes.\"\n\nThe possibility of a less-informed future extends beyond the troubles at BLS. Other agencies are facing a data dilemma. Last June, the Commerce Department disbanded 14 advisory committees, including three at the Census Bureau. Those panels helped keep the Bureau's data-gathering techniques up to date and were key to planning the 2030 decennial census. Several government databases on climate change have been removed or suspended under the Trump administration, which could make it harder for farmers and real estate developers to access crucial information, such as changes in weather patterns or water reserve levels in Western states.\n\nThe American Statistical Association report included a list of dozens of data sets from BLS and other federal agencies that have been discontinued or curtailed in the last two years: cuts to some underlying tables that the Bureau of Economic Analysis uses in calculating GDP, the BLS has stopped tracking what businesses pay for more than 350 products that were once included in the Producer Price Index, changes to the Census Bureau's annual Survey of Income and Program Participation that tracks US households' economic well-being, and an end to the USDA's annual food insecurity survey, which tracks how many Americans are going hungry. Losing any one of these may not be the end of the world (except to some very particular researchers), but the drip of deleted datasets is increasing, and it risks cascading into a river of missing information, imperiling the more high-profile releases that draw headlines and help shape how America thinks about its economy.\n\nOutside federal agencies, there have been other moves that suggest a paucity of data may be in our future. Trump floated changing Securities and Exchange Commission rules to require public companies to submit their financial information twice a year rather than quarterly. While that could make life a little easier for companies and could, in theory, promote longer-term thinking in C-suites, it also would leave investors with less timely information to decide how to allocate capital and disrupt the white-collar job market.\n\nThe degradation of our data isn't just an egghead concern for economists and scientists. Businesses need this data to plan when and where to hire and expand. Consumers need it to make big purchase decisions and plan their careers. The government needs it to allocate resources.\n\nThe most powerful economic body in the world, the Federal Reserve, relies on BLS data to balance its two major goals: low unemployment and stable prices. The Fed's job is already tricky these days., Mmoving interest rates to perfectly calibrate the economy requires precision — leave rates too high for too long and the number of Americans without a job could spike, but lower them too fast and prices could shoot back up. The data gap during the government shutdown likely contributed to the Fed's increased uncertainty and division at its October meeting. Addressing the missing data, Chairman Jerome Powell described the situation using a meteorological analogy: \"What do you do when driving through the fog? You slow down.\"\n\nEven as the Fed walks more carefully, the reality of the economy doesn't slow down with them. A future with less reliable data could mean a less confident and less competent Fed. If a crisis like the 2008 housing market meltdown or the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic strikes, the central bank and Congress need to know exactly how it's affecting the economy as quickly as possible. If unemployment figures aren't reliable, the Fed and congressional responses could be too muted, leading to a longer and deeper recession, or too aggressive, spiking inflation and making everyone worse off.\n\nIf the Fed, with its massive staff of economists, struggled to make decisions without the regular flow of government statistics, then it stands to reason that businesses, which also have to deal with day-to-day operations, will struggle as well. A March 2025 survey of economic and business gurus by the Chicago Booth School of Business found that 90% of respondents agreed that the \"ability of businesses to forecast and plan will be substantially impaired by lower quality economic data.\"\n\nSpeaking on a more personal level, as Business Insider's economic data editor, my job is to see what's going on in the economy and work with a talented team of reporters to help you, the reader, understand what it means for your life. The economic data from the BLS and other agencies is the first step in seeing those trends, and losing it would make it much harder to do that job. And it's not just my job; think of all the data you use to make decisions about your own career: Does the economy seem like it's in a good place to quit your job? What kind of wages could you expect from a career shift? Are there a lot of job openings in your field, or has hiring frozen?\n\nThis slow erosion of the information that informs our decisions also creates a vicious trust feedback loop. Americans are increasingly relying on \"vibes\" to understand the economy, creating a disconnect between how people think and feel about their economic prospects and the underlying reality. This break between lived experience and aggregate measures has eroded trust in the data itself. An August 2025 Economist/YouGov poll found that 45% of respondents completely or somewhat distrust federal economic data, compared with 42% who somewhat or completely trust it. Only 21% of people in the same survey said that the government's count of unemployment was accurate. If economic data becomes less reliable, it will continue to warp people's ideas of the economy and make decision-making harder.\n\nIt is fair to say that the amount of data being collected on our world can be overwhelming. There's more high-quality data than ever before, but there's also more garbage, poorly run surveys, and questionable analysis. It can be hard to make decisions amid that flood, but the answer to our struggles in understanding data is not to generate less data. That only allows bad-faith actors to seize on collective ignorance. The inability to understand the world would make it even harder for a well-run capitalist economy to function.\n\nAndy Kiersz is an economic data editor at Business Insider.",

    "description": "Replit product engineer Rachael Fuller said she signed her contract one week before learning she was pregnant. Here's how she managed her time.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rachael Fuller, a 31-year-old product engineer at Replit, who lives in San Francisco. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm married to my high school sweetheart. We met in standardized testing when we were 12.\n\nWe got married during the pandemic, and our wedding got postponed. By the time we finally had it, I was pregnant with our first. We have two daughters: one who's about to turn 3, and our latest addition, who's 2 and a half months.\n\nI found out I was pregnant with my first when I was winding down my first company. I honestly was like, \"I should just get a job in Big Tech, get the cushy maternity benefits.\" That would be the rational thing to do.\n\nBut I never felt that excited about being a small cog in a very large machine. I decided to take the leap and work on this new startup while also having my first baby, which I don't know that I would recommend.\n\nIt was a journey. We moved back to our home in Massachusetts to be near our family at this time, to have that extra support. I was building these two really big projects: a life inside me, and also a company.\n\nDisclaimer: I have pretty easy pregnancies. I don't get nausea, I sleep pretty well. My husband is also a stay-at-home dad, so that simplifies our life immensely. If it weren't for his sacrifices and picking up the slack, I wouldn't have survived, let alone launch anything. I'm really grateful that he's made that sacrifice.\n\nStill, something's gotta give. I was really into cooking or hosting dinner parties, and that's what I chose to sacrifice.\n\nYou need to be really careful about where you choose to work. Even putting aside the crazy 996 culture, there are a lot of tech companies that are led by people who don't have kids, who don't understand what it takes to raise a family.\n\nI started at Beacons, a small company founded by four single men who are wonderful and wanted to be supportive of me as a mom. I was pumping, and we had to work out where I would do that in this tiny, three-room office. We figured it out.\n\nI joined Replit in April. I signed my offer letter, and then found out the next week that I was pregnant with my second.\n\nA big reason I joined Replit is that there are a lot of families there. When I was doing my last interview with Replit's cofounders, Amjad and Haya, they had their daughter sitting on their lap, chatting with me.\n\nThere have been a few times when I'll come into the office and people's kids will be in for the day. It's not a problem. It's actually kind of cool: my coworker's kid is showing me the app they're building on Replit.\n\nWhen you have that many parents, the company is able to be pro-family in a way that's natural and not forced. It felt like a very supportive environment for me.\n\nI knew this job was going to be a lot more demanding because of where Replit was in its growth curve. I wanted to experience this feeling of hypergrowth.\n\nI worked on an initiative to connect Replit's agent with third-party applications. It's called Connectors. We actually ended up acquiring a company, OpenInt, to make it happen, and I shepherded that acquisition.\n\nWe had to ship it before I gave birth. In tech, you don't often have really hard deadlines like that.\n\nIt was intense. In the weeks leading up to the big launches, we have sprint weeks where we're all together in-person, coding for 12 hours a day. I worked at the office till midnight, Ubered home, and worked a little bit before I went to sleep.\n\nI was in my third trimester. It was crazy.\n\nThe day the Connectors feature launched, I went straight from the office to the hospital. I was having contractions. How crazy would that be, to literally launch both on the same day?\n\nWe shipped the feature at the end of September. Then I had some time to prepare all the hand-off materials. I was supposed to take a week off and go on maternity leave a week before my due date, but my daughter came a week early.\n\nI literally shipped my last feature on Friday, went to the hospital on Saturday, and had a baby.\n\nSprint week is not life at Replit. That 5-8 p.m. period is family time. That's something that I will hold sacred until the day I die. I'm going to have dinner with my kids, and then maybe log back in and finish things up if I need to.\n\nMore immature companies in tech tend to think that parents are too distracted. There are a lot of benefits to hiring parents. They bring a kind of time management that you don't develop until you have kids.",

    "description": "Sam Wright has done around 500 free job support calls from job seekers since last year. Here's his best advice for landing a job in 2026.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sam Wright, a 31-year-old head of growth at Huntr, based in Seattle. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI start my day with at least two, sometimes up to 10, free 15-minute one-on-one job search support sessions.\n\nI get on these calls with people coming from layoffs at big companies like Amazon and Google, and they've never struggled in the job market before. They don't know what to do.\n\nJob seeking is one of the most vulnerable moments in someone's life, so I started offering these free support sessions last July as an extra way to support those struggling in this job market, and I've now done around 500 calls.\n\nI work at Huntr, an AI-powered résumé builder and job search tracker. Most of our clients are from the tech world: software developers and engineers, UI and UX designers, and product and project managers. We use anonymized data collected from our job search tracker and résumé builder to track the job market and train and develop our AI tools. We've analyzed over 1.2 million applications across over 225,000 résumés.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, there's this pent-up energy and renewed optimism in the job market following the end-of-year slowdown. Here are five pieces of advice I tell every job seeker to put their best foot forward.\n\nDuring the early days of COVID, especially in the tech sector, it was a job seeker market. An entry-level software engineer was basically getting handed a job once they finished school. Now, that's not the case.\n\nMany job seekers have applied to hundreds of jobs and still don't hear back. In an employer-favored market, your North Star should be the application-to-interview conversion rate.\n\nMake sure you're metrics-driven in your search approach, because it's ultimately a sales process. You're selling your services and skills, and how often your applications result in job interviews is a measurable way to see how well you're doing this.\n\nApply to one target job title at a time. You can pivot as needed, but our best practice is to apply to 10 to 15 jobs with a well-tailored résumé that matches the job description, and to do so for the next two to three weeks.\n\nIf you aren't getting an interview within 20 applications, and definitely within 50, you need to think about getting feedback on the résumé and taking a second look at where and what you're applying for.\n\nDifferent job boards also have different application-to-interview conversion rates, so try applying to different jobs using different websites such as LinkedIn, Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and more to help increase your conversion rate.\n\nEverybody who posts a job online wants it to be searchable on Google.\n\nDoing a Boolean search on Google should be a routine part of your job search process. Boolean searches are basically just sophisticated searches, with a few different parameters that let you combine keywords and narrow your search.\n\nSimply doing a Google search for jobs aggregates all of the jobs across all of the job boards and can be the best way to start your search. If you search for something like \"Data Analyst Jobs\" on Google, it will realize the intent is to look for a job posting and show you postings under the dedicated jobs tab at the top of the search.\n\nThe jobs are sourced from all over the web because sites want their job postings to be indexed and searchable by Google for SEO purposes.\n\nThe page length of your résumé is one of the biggest things that people struggle with. I've seen that across the board, entry-level, mid-range, and senior-level, it doesn't matter. We see a slight increase in responses with two-page résumés.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's not about the length of the résumé; it's the quality of the content as it matches the job description to which you're applying.\n\nFor example, having a bit more about you in your education section has ultimately been helpful. Awards, accomplishments, and key achievements from school are also helpful, as long as they're relevant to the job description.\n\nYour achievements section of your résumé should look something like, \"I did X, which had Y result and Z impact.\" A lot of people miss the last part, or the 'why it matters,' which is connecting the ultimate impact your achievement had.\n\nRemember that even a hospital janitor is helping save lives in some way. That's an extreme example, but it's all about the framing and how you see yourself in the greater picture.\n\nDo you have a story or advice to share about landing a job in the current job market?

    "description": "Scott Borchetta discusses his daily schedule, balancing meetings, artist management, daily exercise, and watching Netflix with his wife.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Borchetta, the 63-year-old CEO and chairman of Big Machine Label Group, based in Nashville. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started my career in the mailroom for my dad's promotion company and worked my way up after we moved from California to Nashville. I played bass in a country band at night, where I learned about the music industry. I used that knowledge to pursue jobs at record labels.\n\nMy first job in the industry was at MTM Records. I then spent two years working as an independent promoter before moving into promotion and artist development roles at MCA Nashville Records, DreamWorks Nashville, and Universal Music Nashville.\n\nIn 2005, I left Universal Music Nashville to start Big Machine Records. The record label I founded has grown over 20 years into the Big Machine Label Group.\n\nBMLG artists have included Taylor Swift, Rascal Flatts, Reba McEntire, Florida Georgia Line, Thomas Rhett, Brantley Gilbert, Ronnie Dunn, Sugarland, and Carly Pearce, among others.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nThe first thing I do when I wake up is work out for 90 minutes. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, the workout takes place at my house with a trainer. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, it's held at a physical therapy center.\n\nAfter my workout, I become a fireman by checking my phone and seeing what's happening in the business, because there's always something burning. I respond to urgent messages so that I can focus on the day's mission. When you have 35-plus artists, there's always a meeting, new music to be made, and the next TV show to schedule.\n\nI eat light in the morning; I like to let the workout burn. I'm more of a green tea person, as that doesn't have too much caffeine.\n\nI'm in the office every business day; I'm still old school about that. I appreciate the energy of people interacting, and face-to-face interactions still yield the best results and understanding of the mission.\n\nOn Monday, I have a publicity meeting, followed by an A&R meeting. In the afternoon, we have our three different country imprint promotion calls, because Monday is our ad day, so we find out which stations added which records.\n\nTuesday's our leadership day. Wednesday and Thursday have standing meetings. I leave Friday open. Anyone who wants to schedule with me has to go through my executive assistant.\n\nEven for business lunches, it's easier to have people come and bring food. That way, we won't waste 30 to 40 minutes going back and forth.\n\nI usually have a kale salad with salmon, or a sliced filet — definitely a protein-rich midday option. I'm not a huge eater, but those are my go-to options, and I eat sushi once a week.\n\nThe indulgence I allow myself most days is one eight-ounce can of Red Bull for a surge in the afternoon.\n\nI recently met with Mackenzie Carpenter about the new album she's preparing to record. The next day, I might have a Thomas Rhett strategy meeting.\n\nI have time in the afternoon to catch up on things and ensure we're moving forward. Every day is different. I try to leave a couple of hours in the afternoon to do the actual work, rather than nonstop back-to-back meetings.\n\nThe time I leave depends on what we have going on. The artists we have playing will dictate when I leave the office. The other night, I went to see Jackson Dean at the Opry at 9 p.m.\n\nIf I have an open night, it's a great opportunity for me to catch up and spend some quality time with my wife. My wife is a very good cook. Occasionally, we'll order out, so I always say, \"Oh, I cooked. Look, honey.\"\n\nMy wife and I enjoy binge-watching shows together at night. Friday night is party night; we'll have red wine, usually a Bordeaux or Cali Cab, and there's always chocolate hidden in a cupboard.\n\nOne of my favorite series from the last year or so was The Offering, which is a series on the making of The Godfather. We've just finished Acapulco.\n\nAfter watching a show with my wife, I'll typically go to bed late, wake up, and do it all over again.\n\nAn example of a week of travel is being in Vegas from Wednesday through Sunday morning. Wednesday night, we saw Mötley Crüe. On Thursday night, we attended a crazy show called Absinthe, a Cirque du Soleil production.\n\nFriday night featured Sammy Hagar, who was part of the iHeart Festival, and Saturday night was Tim McGraw, also part of the iHeart Festival. Many of the iHeart crew are dear friends and great business partners, so it's often very late nights.\n\nI work on the weekends if something needs to be done.\n\nFor my artists, especially, I always make time for them if they need anything. It doesn't derail my day when we have to rearrange some things. Even if something goes really wrong, I'm very good at compartmentalizing.\n\nJust because something went wrong with this artist or manager doesn't mean the next executive or the next artist will inherit that overflow — I try to put the right energy where it belongs.\n\nWhen I spend a lot of time having in-person conversations during the day and come back to see that I have 168 emails, I'm like, Ugh. Email is so ineffective in many ways, but it's a necessary evil. If I could do away with it, I would much rather be in person.\n\nA lot of these artists are my friends, and they walk in, and people are like, \"Oh my God, did you see that so-and-so was in the office today?\" I'm always listening to new music from our artists and potential new signings. Non Big Machine artists on the playlist jump from Yungblud to Ella Langley to Sombr.\n\nWhether it was Taylor Swift back in the day, or Reba McIntyre, or Dolly Parton, or Riley Green right now — I love working with artists who think big.\n\nI'm proud of our NASCAR team, Big Machine Racing, and I'm proud of Borchetta Bourbon, which is off to its best year ever. There are many fun things across all our brands, and I love what I do.",

    "description": "Igor Tsvetkov says he faced a \"lot of stress\" as a senior staff engineer at Meta. But securing a demotion isn't easy, he said. Now, he's at Google.",
    "fullText": "There are dozens and dozens of guides on how to ask for a promotion. What about a demotion?\n\nIgor Tsvetkov spent over a year as a senior staff software engineer at Meta, coming from a background at Google and Cruise. Then he posted on LinkedIn, describing how difficult he found it to try to blend into Meta's culture — and why he decided to ask for a downward shift in title.\n\n\"I did not fit in perfectly,\" Tsvetkov wrote in the December post, describing the need for intimate systems knowledge and credibility among leaders at his rank. \"It is very hard to achieve all of that when you join as a new hire from another company and work from a remote office.\"\n\nHis slow ramp-up caused a \"lot of stress,\" he wrote, and he eventually wished for a demotion — before jumping back to Google.\n\nOn \"The Peterman Pod,\" Tsvetkov recently described his Meta story in more detail. During performance reviews, Tsvetkov said he knew he was being judged against other senior staff engineers. He also knew that Meta laid off low performers.\n\n\"What it means is: you have at most one year to ramp up to be comparable in performance to other old-timers at the company,\" Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov needed to \"start from zero,\" he said. On day one, he said he knew less than the intern sitting next to him. Within the year and two months that he spent at Meta, Tsvetkov guessed that he had reached the performance of an E6 software engineer — if he was \"generous\" — but not the E7 he was hired to be.\n\nHe also learned he didn't want to be an E7. Coding and debugging were what Tsvetkov loved about his job, he said, but those skills are rarely practiced at that high a level.\n\nWhile Tsvetkov's experience is not necessarily representative of what other Meta engineers experience, it captures how difficult it can be to make career moves at the senior level, across tech and beyond. Meta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTsvetkov eventually said he asked management: \"Can I actually drop a level?\"\n\nThat's difficult for Meta, he recognized. His stock grants and compensation were already determined. There is a demotion process at Meta — like when a director wants to become an individual contributor — but dropping a single level on the same team was more challenging, Tsvetkov said.\n\nTsvetkov said he was told no. Maybe if he pushed harder, or went to a vice president, the answer would have been different, he said.\n\n\"I also felt like I was too far outside my comfort zone,\" he added. \"I worked at Google for 14 and a half years. That was my comfort zone.\"\n\nA Google recruiter had been contacting Tsvetkov periodically, asking whether he was ready to return. He finally said yes.",

    "description": "A handful of billionaires and prominent companies urged corporations to leave Delaware. According to the numbers, the opposite happened.",
    "fullText": "A handful of billionaires and prominent companies have tried to cement a new, less-than-ideal narrative about Delaware: The glory days are over.\n\n\"Companies should get the hell out of Delaware,\" Elon Musk, who previously had two companies incorporated in the state, wrote on X in 2024.\n\nHowever, dozens of X posts and interviews disparaging the state over its handling of certain legal cases haven't moved the needle. In fact, the opposite has happened: The number of companies incorporated in Delaware has increased.\n\n\"Amid fears of decline, 2025 was a period of monumental growth for Delaware,\" Andrew Verstein, the author of the Corporate Census, wrote in a recent report.\n\nThe Corporate Census is a database of nearly all entity formations in the United States, including traditional corporate registrations and alternative options such as LLCs.\n\nVerstein has spent almost two years collecting data on corporations and published an update to his research earlier this month.\n\nAlthough Delaware has a reputation as a business-friendly state, it faced a storm of bad press in 2024 and 2025 when some companies began to ditch the state for what they considered greener legal pastures. Musk, most prominently, removed Tesla and SpaceX's corporate registrations from Delaware after a judge voided his multibillion-dollar Tesla pay package.\n\nHe and some other prominent CEOs have criticized Delaware's courts over what they consider subjective rulings. Delaware's Supreme Court reinstated Musk's pay package in December, but not before some of Musk's peers joined his unofficial campaign.\n\nCompanies like the VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and the leading crypto-exchange Coinbase followed suit, also citing uncertainty around Delaware's legal system as a factor in their departures, going so far as to urge others to do the same. The alleged exodus has been dubbed \"Dexit,\" a play on the words \"Delaware\" and \"exit.\"\n\nDespite the departures, Delaware is doing just fine.\n\n\"The short answer is that 'Dexit' isn't happening,\" Verstein told Business Insider.\n\nIn his report, Verstein wrote that Delaware's share of corporate formations increased sharply at the beginning of 2025. Delaware experienced an \"absolute increase,\" he wrote, meaning the growth was driven by new formations in Delaware rather than a decline in formations in other states.\n\n\"Instead, there is a clear increase in Delaware's relative popularity beginning in 2025, making it a singular leader in a period otherwise lacking corporate growth,\" Verstein wrote in the report. \"About 30% more Delaware corporations formed in 2025 than in 2024, greatly exceeding the prior trendline. This, while national incorporation levels remained flat.\"\n\nAt the moment, Verstein said the official cause of the formation boost isn't clear, but speculated on two theories. For one, Delaware implemented new laws to address some of the complaints from Musk and others. They strengthened corporate management's authority and altered shareholder rights.\n\n\"These laws were intended to restore confidence in Delaware law after several 2024 judicial opinions arguably upset market expectations. Yet the jump in incorporations begins prior to the late February 2025 announcement of SB 21. And it begins substantially after the March 2024 passage of SB 313,\" Verstein wrote. \"While it is certainly possible that the increase reflects a lagged response to SB 313, or perhaps a preemptive response to the legislative currents that led to SB 21, the timing does not immediately commend itself to that explanation.\"\n\nHe also pointed toward external factors outside Delaware's control.\n\n\"For example, President Donald J. Trump won the general election on November 5, 2024 and took office on January 20, 2025,\" he wrote. \"Perhaps Delaware corporations were expected to be especially useful under his administration.\"\n\nVerstein said, despite the cause being unclear, \"the data are plainly incompatible with the most alarmist theories of Dexit.\"\n\nFor its part, Delaware's government is unfazed.\n\n\"Delaware continues to lead the world as the preeminent home for business,\" a spokesperson for Delaware's Secretary of State, which oversees corporations, said in a statement. \"The data speaks for itself — Delaware's corporate franchise remains strong thanks in large part to the unmatched expertise and efficiency of the Delaware Division of Corporations.\"\n\nDuring a 2024 interview with Business Insider, Secretary of State Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez brushed off concerns that they were struggling due to \"political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"We don't believe that Delaware's position as the corporate leader and corporate capital of the world is being threatened in any significant way,\" Patibanda-Sanchez said. \"We always come under threat, though, because states are always trying to get a piece of the action.\"",

    "title": "How AI is changing the storied McKinsey interview",
    "description": "From McKinsey & Company to Boston Consulting Group, AI has now become a factor in the case interview.",
    "fullText": "Entire books have been written to teach people how to beat a McKinsey interview. Now, the game is changing.\n\nFor decades, consulting firms like McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, and Bain & Company have relied on case interviews, during which prospective candidates work through simulated client problems with higher-ups at the firm.\n\nNow, as consulting firms race to both adopt AI and advise their clients on how to do the same — implementing the technology into everything from drafting reports to synthesizing data — the technology has become a new hurdle in the vaunted interview process at McKinsey, BCG, and others.\n\nThe changes come as these firms shift the type of work they do, focusing less on straight advisory projects and more on building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies. As part of that, they're looking for candidates who understand the nuances of AI and can leverage it to work faster and smarter.\n\nEarlier this month, several media outlets reported that McKinsey had begun piloting Lilli, its internal chatbot, in interviews. The firm declined to comment further on the use of Lilli.\n\nLilli is used within the firm to synthesize its proprietary research, which spans 100 years and over 100,000 documents and interviews.\n\nMcKinsey Senior Partner Delphine Zurkiya told Business Insider that over 70% of the firm's 45,000 employees now use the tool, and that those who use it do so about 17 times a week. Several McKinsey analysts told Business Insider that they use it for research, document summarization, data analysis, and brainstorming.\n\nStephen Turban, a former McKinsey analyst who has worked with hundreds of students applying for roles at McKinsey, BCG, and Bain through his company, Wall Street Guide, said that he's noticed Lilli come up in the later rounds of the case interview — often to the surprise of candidates.\n\n\"The biggest reaction is a little bit of a lack of preparation,\" said Turban, who is also the cofounder of Lumiere Education, a platform that connects students with Ph.D. mentors to produce independent research.\n\nEven as a mentor, there's not much that he can do to help students, he said.\n\n\"It seems like the AI is created to give information that's not 100% correct or vague,\" he said. So, it's a test of how well students can solve problems with a certain level of ambiguity.\n\nAre you a consultant? Tell us how you're using AI below.\n\nBoston Consulting Group also has an automated portion of the interview run by its chatbot, Casey. Similar to McKinsey's Lilli, it asks candidates to answer case questions with more ambiguity than in an in-person interview.\n\nAmmon Jensen, an MBA candidate at Brigham Young University who just accepted a summer internship offer at BCG, told Business Insider that one of his opening questions was a market-sizing exercise around a DoorDash competitor. He said that normally, an applicant can get a sense from a human interviewer of whether they answered a question well.\n\n\"It's really hard to get an interview, but once you've got an interview, they really want you to succeed,\" he said. Casey, however, is more neutral, he said.\n\nThere's a limit, however, to how much consulting firms want their applicants to be using AI.\n\nDuring a networking call with a BCG recruiter, Jensen learned that the firm, at least in the Dallas office, had stopped reviewing cover letters because they are now so easy to write with ChatGPT and other AI tools.\n\nAnd some applicants have been rejected for using technology in their interviews in unapproved ways.\n\n\"Some people have already gotten in trouble using AI during case interviews,\" Marc Cosentino, the author of Case in Point, the definitive how-to for acing consulting interviews, told Business Insider.\n\nThere have been instances where students have begun using AI in Zoom interviews to help them solve cases, he said. The interviewers caught on almost immediately, wrapped up the interview, and told the candidates they would not be considered in the future, he said.\n\n\"Word gets around,\" he added. \"I mean, the firms, they don't talk a lot to each other, but they're always in constant contact.\"\n\nSomething to share about how consultants are using AI?

    "description": "The CEO of a payments startup says linking AI adoption to profit sharing helped cut costs and boost morale.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ran Grushkowsky, who co-founded the Las Vegas-based payments company MassPay in 2000, then served on its board, and was named CEO in December. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nUntil mid-2025, it was a challenge to get employees at MassPay to use AI. They were maybe afraid that it would replace their jobs. There was a misalignment around how AI could produce cost savings.\n\nTo solve this problem, we created a profit-sharing program, and it's working well for us. We announced it a year ago and told employees we have two goals. One is to make more money, which is obvious. The more important one is to cut costs.\n\nThe idea was that the more efficiently they work, the bigger the pool of money they'd get to share. It was a little bit of a shock at first. People are used to getting bonuses or stock options, so profit-sharing took a little bit of explaining. But once it clicked, we started to see results.\n\nThe way it works is that the company first sets aside the money it needs to maintain operations and grow. Any profit beyond that threshold goes into the profit-sharing pool.\n\nEach eligible employee's share is calculated by dividing their salary by the total number of eligible salaries, then multiplying by the amount in the profit-sharing pool.\n\nSay an employee makes $100,000 a year, and the eligible employees' salaries total $2 million, and the profit-sharing pool is $300,000. The employee would receive 15% of their salary, or $15,000.\n\nLast year, participants received 18% of their annual salary from the program. This year, we expect they'll receive close to 50%.\n\nBefore we started doing this, we planned to hire about five people in 2025, but that need has been eliminated thanks to AI. We were able to help our employees find their own superpowers so they could do more than they did before.\n\nFor example, when a business is submitting an application to become a client, it used to take a week to process all the information — documents such as letters of incorporation, compliance manuals, and user agreements. Now we can do it within 24 hours.\n\nAI isn't replacing existing employees, and because of our incentive program, I think morale has increased. Initially, it was a concern, but everybody wants to be part of a winning team. AI tools can help you improve everything you do as a team.",

    "description": "Hedge fund allocators can't get enough of quant and macro trading. Quants accounted for more than 70% of the industry's net inflows last year.",
    "fullText": "Hedge funds are \n\nFor the second year in a row, hedge funds — the group of firms including Citadel, Millennium, D.E. Shaw, and Bridgewater — are the most sought-after asset class, according to Goldman Sachs' prime services industry outlook report. The group's lead over private equity, private credit, venture capital, and other alternatives reached an all-time high, according to the bank's data.\n\n\"Almost half of allocators plan to increase their allocation to hedge funds in 2026, compared to just 4% who plan to trim their allocation,\" Goldman said in the report.\n\nBut demand isn't evenly spread across strategies. Some hedge fund approaches are far more coveted than others heading into 2026.\n\nQuantitative trading strategies — which rely on computer models and algorithms rather than human judgment — are the most in-demand strategy, according to Goldman's survey of more than 300 hedge fund allocators. On net, 23% of allocators said they plan to increase exposure to quant funds.\n\nDiscretionary macro strategies ranked close behind, with 21% of allocators planning to add exposure. Those funds make human-driven bets on global economic trends across markets like interest rates, currencies, and commodities.\n\nBoth strategies delivered solid performance in 2025 and offer diversification from equity-heavy portfolios, particularly after another strong year for stock markets. The rising demand suggests \"allocators remain focused on adding uncorrelated exposure to their hedge fund portfolios,\" Goldman said.\n\nDespite bouts of market turbulence in July and October, quantitative funds gained 10.5% in aggregate last year. Firms including Qube Research, D.E. Shaw, and AQR posted standout results.\n\nOver the past five years, quant strategies have been the best-performing hedge fund category, according to Goldman's data, and they have dominated fundraising. Quant funds accounted for more than 70% of the industry's $78 billion in net inflows in 2025 — their second consecutive year leading by a wide margin.\n\nDiscretionary macro strategies typically thrive during periods of economic and geopolitical volatility. Tariff tensions, shifting interest-rate expectations, and geopolitical flare-ups helped drive returns in 2025, and many investors see similar conditions ahead in 2026.\n\nMacro funds gained 11.5% overall last year, with firms like Bridgewater, Element, and Rokos posting returns above 20%. Demand could remain strong as President Donald Trump continues to publicly pressure the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\n\nNot all macro strategies have fared as well. Systematic macro funds and commodity trading advisors — automated strategies that trade global futures markets — struggled in 2025 and over the past five years, with gains of just 0.5% and 5.3%, respectively.\n\nUnsurprisingly, they are the least popular strategies among allocators heading into 2026.",

    "description": "The erosion of economic data over the past year poses a massive risk for individuals and businesses",
    "fullText": "They say numbers never lie, but what if we don't have them in the first place?\n\nThe erosion of economic data over the past year poses a massive risk for individuals and businesses, writes BI's Andy Kiersz. (As our economic data editor, he would know!)\n\nYou might scoff at the idea that there isn't enough data. Sometimes it can feel like we have too much information on just about everything.\n\nThe crux of the issue is government-issued data, specifically from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS is the backbone of our economic data infrastructure, offering hyper-specific information on everything from jobs to prices. Not only is it valuable in its own right, it's also leveraged by private-data providers to build out their feeds.\n\nBut budget cuts, leadership changes, and old-school data-gathering techniques mean the data so many people and businesses rely on might not be that reliable for much longer.\n\nThat creates challenges for anyone looking to navigate an economy that's hard enough in the best of circumstances.\n\nNot everyone stands to lose, though.\n\nBack when I was a real reporter and didn't just ride the coattails of my more-talented colleagues via this newsletter, I wrote a lot about alternative data.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, alt data is non-traditional information that's not readily available and often takes some time to sift through. A classic example: Satellite images of a retail chain's parking lots to gauge foot traffic.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Because it shows the outside-the-box ways companies and investors can get economic data. And while it might not be as all-encompassing as what the BLS offers, it's a start.\n\nBut here's the rub. That data isn't available to everyone. In fact, plenty of investors pay more money to make sure they're the only ones that have it.\n\nSo as publicly available data becomes tougher to get, a gap could grow between those who can afford to splurge for alternative options and everyone else.\n\nAs we examine the future of capitalism, a common complaint about the current system is the widening chasm between the haves and the have nots. The loss of widely available economic data threatens to spread that even more.",

    "description": "The \"father of the iPod,\" Tony Fadell, said the market is ripe for a new take on one of Apple's most famous devices.",
    "fullText": "Forget 2016, it's time to make sound like 2001 again.\n\nTony Fadell, creator of the iPod, said it is time for Apple to relaunch the device that changed the Cupertino-based tech giant and music forever.\n\n\"I think there are smarter ways of making an AirPod that has an iPod in it. So, I think they need to bring back the iPod,\" Fadell told Eric Newcomer during a recent interview on the tech journalist's podcast.\n\nFadell, widely known as \"the father of the iPod,\" said there are two reasons to bring back the device that is synonymous with his legacy.\n\nFirst, to cash in on the broader nostalgia around the music device, which ended in 2019 with the release of the revamped, 7th-generation iPod Touch. The original iPod, which could hold just 1,000 songs, shared much \n\n\"So, iPod from the nostalgic point of view for all those people who's like, 'Oh, I remember the iPod,' but they don't want distractions anymore,\" Fadell said.\n\nSecond, a modern iPod would also tap into a market of music listeners who want a more \"pure\" experience, listening to music without all the extra stuff that comes with listening to music on a smartphone. After all, dumb phones are becoming increasingly popular as people try to simplify their relationship with tech.\n\nOnline, there are still active communities that seek to mod the now-retro iPods to fit more modern needs, including an entire subreddit devoted to the cause.\n\nPressed on what form a new iPod would take, Fadell said he wouldn't give away all of his ideas. Fadell has been mentioned in some corners as a potential replacement for CEO Tim Cook, who has been the subject of retirement speculation. (Cook, who is 64, has said he will not retire in a \"traditional\" way.) Apple exec John Ternus, the iPhone company's senior vice president of hardware engineering, is widely reported to be the top contender to replace Cook.\n\n\"Apple will make the right decision when they need to, about who the next CEO is. I love the company. It's been in my blood since 1980, '81, when I had my first Apple II,\" Fadell said. \"If anyone calls from the board, or Tim called, whatever, I'll be happy to pick up the phone and that's it. I'll help 'em any way they think they would like to be helped.\"\n\nFadell pointed to how Sony — which sells a $3,699 collector's edition of a Walkman — recently announced its first new turntables in years, seeking to capitalize on the growing number of vinyl listeners. Sony also sold off control of its TV line to TCL.\n\n\"They kill the TVs, and they bring back turntables,\" Fadell said. \"You tell me.\"",

A humiliation.\n\nAfterwards, boss Sonia Bompastor pledged to keep searching for solutions but conceded she would be \"happy\" to leave if the Chelsea hierarchy felt her time was up.\n\nSo where has it all gone wrong for her side this season?",

Our commitment to inclusion and our support for the LGBTQ+ community remains unchanged.\"\n\nThe club apologised the next day and said the team acknowledged the \"hurt and disappointment\" that came as a result of the decision.\n\nA spokesperson said the Fife Flyers was committed to inclusion and being a welcoming club for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThey added: \"We are truly sorry for the impact this had and understand why it has caused upset amongst the community.\n\n\"We will reflect on this, continue listening, and work to ensure our values are better reflected in how we move forward.\"\n\nThe match kit was due to be auctioned to raise funds for local LGBTQ+ charity The Hive Kirkcaldy.\n\nThe charity said it was \"extremely disappointed\" in the decision, adding that it had not been informed about the decision beforehand.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"In light of this, The Hive have refused to accept any money, strip or donations from the club and left the match immediately.\n\n\"We will be writing to them regarding this. The Hive will always stand up for LGBTQIA+ rights and we will not be silenced.\"\n\nFife Pride said it was \"angry and deeply disappointed\" in the club's decision.\n\nIt said: \"Let us be clear: Pride is not a warm-up. Pride is not optional. And Pride is not something that should be compromised to accommodate 'personal beliefs'.\n\n\"When an organisation chooses to scale back visible LGBTQIA+ inclusion, that is a choice, and it has consequences.\n\n\"Decisions like this undermine trust, damage relationships with the community, and send a harmful message about whose identities are considered negotiable.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn the aftermath of a 95–61 blowout loss to No. 8 Iowa State, that was the sentence Jerome Tang chose to stand on as Kansas State slipped to two games under .500 as February is underway. No hedging. No qualifiers. Just a clear rejection of the framing.\n\nThe scoreboard left little room for interpretation. Iowa State was faster, stronger, and sharper. Tang didn’t argue that. “They’re just better than we are right now,” he said, repeatedly crediting the Cyclones. What he refused to do was let the moment fracture his locker room.\n\n“This is not a message for the fans,” Tang said. “This is a message for my players.”\n\nThat posture carried through the entire press conference. When asked about disappointment, he pushed back. When pressed to expand, he declined. “No, I don’t want to expand on it.” When the conversation drifted toward broader program questions, he deferred. “At the end of the season we’ll talk about that.”\n\nMore: Jerome Tang buyout, contract details as Kansas State Wildcats coach\n\nStill, Tang didn’t hide from accountability. With program legends in attendance, he turned the disappointment inward. “I’m more disappointed in me as a as a coach and the game plan for the first half than I am for the players for their execution,” he said.\n\nThe message remained consistent. Protect the players. Own the rest.\n\nMore: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nAsked whether the group remains bought in, Tang was brief but firm. “They’re still trying. Yes. Yes, they are.”\n\nThere was definitely an edge in the room, but it wasn’t reckless. It was protective. Tang wasn’t denying results or pretending the season has gone to plan. He was drawing a boundary around how his team would be discussed publicly.This is the kind of press conference that gets remembered quietly.\n\nDefiance doesn’t guarantee anything. But at 10–12 this late in the season, it draws a clear picture. Tang isn’t hedging. He’s standing with his guys and betting that belief still matters.\n\nHubert Davis buyout, contract details as UNC Tar Heels coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nPenny Hardaway buyout, contract details as Memphis Tigers coach\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox traded right-handed pitchers Jordan Hicks and David Sandlin to the Chicago White Sox on Monday.\n\nHicks, 29, joins Chicago after recording a 6.95 ERA in 34 games during the 2025 season. He split that time between the San Francisco Giants and the Red Sox, appearing in 21 games for Boston. The Texas native struck out 58 batters more than 67 one/three innings and made nine starts during the year.\n\nThe Red Sox originally acquired Hicks on June 15, 2025, in a trade that sent Rafael Devers to the Giants. Since being drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2015, Hicks has appeared in 275 career Major League games with the Cardinals, Toronto Blue Jays, Giants and Red Sox. He holds a career 4.41 ERA.\n\nSandlin, 24, was also sent to Chicago after pitching for Double-A Portland and Triple-A Worcester in 2025. He posted a 4.50 ERA with 107 strikeouts across 106 innings. Sandlin was considered one of Boston’s top prospects, ranking No. 8 by MLB.com and No. 11 by Baseball America. During the 2025 season, he was twice named the Eastern League Pitcher of the Week.\n\nThe Oklahoma native began his professional career with the Kansas City Royals, who selected him in the 11th round of the 2022 draft. Boston acquired him via trade on Feb. 17, 2024. Throughout his minor league career, Sandlin has a 4.38 ERA and 279 strikeouts in 65 games.\n\nIn exchange, Boston acquired minor league pitcher Gage Ziehl, cash considerations, and a player to be named later.\n\nZiehl, 22, comes to the Boston organization following his first professional season. He posted a 4.12 ERA with 90 strikeouts and 19 walks across three different minor league levels in 2025. He started the season in the New York Yankees system before being traded to the White Sox on July 30. Following that trade, he recorded a 4.01 ERA in six starts for High-A Winston-Salem.\n\nZiehl was a fourth-round pick by the Yankees in 2024 out of the University of Miami. The South Carolina native is currently ranked as a top prospect by both MLB.com (No. 14) and Baseball America (No. 21).\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "fullText": "Third-Year coaching grades: Where Kenny Dillingham, Deion Sanders and Brent Key rank from A to F originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe end of the 2025 college football season concluded year three for eight power four college football coaches. Kenny Dillingham-Arizona State, Hugh Freeze-Auburn, Scott Satterfield-Cincinnati, Deion Sanders-Colorado, Brent Key-Georgia Tech, Jeff Brohm-Louisville, Matt Rhule-Nebraska and Luke Fickell-Wisconsin.\n\nCBS Sports compiled grades for those eight coaches. Within their grades, these coaches can be placed on three tiers. Doing a good job, on the hot seat, and fired.\n\nAll eight coaches have varying degrees of notoriety, hype and expectation. Based on those factors vs the on-field results play into the letter grades. However, the grades and order might be less than predictable.\n\nNo. 1 Kenny Dillingham – Grade A\n\nCoach Dillingham is the only coach on this list of third year coaches with hardware. In 2024, Dillingham’s Sun Devils secured a Big 12 conference championship. Despite an early 3-9 start to his ASU coaching tenure, Dillingham has been an unconditional success at his alma mater.\n\nSince joining the Big 12, Arizona State has 13-5 record vs conference opponents. In addition to the Big 12 championship, Dillingham led the Sun Devils to a college football playoff berth and a top 10 finish in 2024.\n\nDillingham has a signature win against a top 10 ranked Texas Tech team, as well as a 6-2 record against ranked opponents in the last two seasons.\n\nKey at Georgia Tech is another example of a former player at the helm. A former Yellow Jackets offensive lineman has done an admirable job bringing Georgia Tech back into the national conversation.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets under Key have been bowl eligible each year under his watch and the win total peaked in 2025 reaching nine. Falling just short of making the college football playoff.\n\nIn three short seasons, Key has made Georgia Tech a contender in the ACC. Key has a 20-11 record against conference opponents. He also has signature wins against Miami and Clemson. The only ACC teams to make a national championship game in the playoff era.\n\nThe final “A” goes to Louisville coach Brohm. Brohm saw success in Louisville immediately. The Cardinals in 2023 were in the ACC Championship game and finished that season with a top 20 ranking.\n\nThe former Louisville quarterback took the head coaching job in 2023 and has quickly compiled double nine-win seasons (2024, 2025). Brohm has 28 wins in three seasons. Giving him the best winning percentage on this list.\n\nBrohm’s record against conference opponents has been inconsistent, due in some part to a late season losing streak in 2025. Regardless of where the wins come from, Brohm earns a spot on the top tier with the best win total of the group.\n\nNo. 4 Deion Sanders – Grade: C+\n\nObjectively, this feels a little high. More than any other coach on this list, Sanders capitalized on hype. With his Louis Luggage following him to Boulder, 2023 had some high points but was an objectively unsuccessful season.\n\nAfter beating TCU after their title game appearance in 2022, Sanders’ Buffs would jump out to a 3-0 record. Overnight Colorado became must see tv. In week four they were beat convincingly by Oregon and lost a close game to USC shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 2024 Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders led a pass happy offense to a 9-3 regular season record. They also played in the Alamo Bowl. Colorado was in the Big 12 title game hunt until week 11.\n\nDespite trending in the right direction in 2024, the Buffaloes had their worst season under Sanders in 2025. Sanders faced significant medical concerns during the offseason and recruiting calendar of 2025. Since then, Sanders has promised changes and overhauled the roster again. Sanders is the highest ranked coach on this list with a losing record.\n\nRhule at five when Sanders is at four is slightly confusing. However, that could be a comparison of where those respective programs are compared to where they used to be. While Sanders has returned excitement to Colorado, Rhule has yet to meet expectations.\n\nA program once viewed as a national contender is coming off two bowl eligible seasons and the first postseason win in almost a decade. Bowl eligible just simply is not the expectation.\n\nRhule has the Cornhuskers as better than they were, but 10-17 record vs conference opponents is far ‘doing a good job’. In three seasons, Rhule does not possess a quality win over an AP top 25 ranked opponent.\n\nNo 6 Scott Satterfield – Grade: C-\n\nTechnically, the Cincinnati Bearcats are trending in the right direction under Satterfield, just not as quickly as fans might have hoped. In 2023, Satterfield and the Bearcats were a 3-9 football team, with a 1-8 conference record.\n\nIn 2024 they improved to 5-7 (3-6 in conference), before finishing 7-6 (5-4 in conference) in 2025. In 2025, they finished in the top half of division 1 for the first time under Satterfield.\n\nIn 2025, Cincinnati was very active in the transfer portal. Bringing in 20 new players, mostly 3-stars from varying levels, while losing 19. The biggest loss being 5-star quarterback Brendan Sorsby to Texas Tech.\n\nFickell had become a big name after some success with Cincinnati. When Fickell was hired at Wisconsin, it was celebrated by college football viewers. The results have simply been less than expected.\n\nFickell’s Badgers made a bowl game in 2023 and the on-field production has regressed since. Fickell’s 17-21 record has led to considerable speculation on his future with the program.\n\nSurprisingly, Fickell survived the 2025 hot seat. A name that was on many short lists of coaches who could be fired in 2025. Joe Thomas, one of the greatest Badgers of all time, said firing Fickell is not the answer, in a radio interview late last year.\n\nFickell will likely begin the 2026 season where he spent the 2025 season. On the hot seat.\n\nIn three years, Coach Freeze led the Auburn Tigers to one bowl game, coming off a 6-7 record. That season, Auburn did not finish in the top half of division 1 (71st of 133).\n\n2024 and 2025 resulted in double 5-7 records. The conference record paints an even more scathing picture. Auburn, once believed to be a college football power and a leading SEC team has only three conference wins in the last two seasons.\n\nA 6-16 record against SEC teams overall in three years falls decidedly below expectations.\n\nBefore the end of the 2025 season, Auburn decided to part ways with Hugh Freeze. Alex Golesh from South Florida took over in December. Since then, the Tigers have flipped more than 39 of the players on the 2025 roster.\n\nSNL pokes fun at Michael Irvin's amped up Miami Hurricanes fandom\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nJimmy Kimmel roasts Bill Belichick’s girlfriend over Hall of Fame debate\n\nGoogle changes Curt Cignetti search results following Indiana’s CFP title win\n\nEx-Indiana QB fires back after portrayal in CBS 60 Minutes interview",

But with head coach Robert Saleh planning on calling defensive plays, Bradley might lean more toward Arizona.\n\nBradley spent the last three seasons as the defensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts. He has been a DC or head coach in the NFL since 2009. He has run the defenses of the Colts, Seattle Seahawks, LA Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. He was the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars from 2013-2016.\n\nHis experience would also be welcome, as LaFleur is a first-time head coach.\n\nOf course, LaFleur and Bradley have not crossed paths yet on any team, so we will see what the plan is.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "fullText": "The New York Knicks spoiled what might have been LeBron James's last game at Madison Square Garden, stretching their win streak to six games with a 112-100 victory.\n\nOG Anunoby scored 25 points and reserve Landry Shamet added 23 to lead the Knicks.\n\nFour-time NBA Most Valuable Player James, a 41-year-old Lakers star, remains uncommitted beyond this season, his NBA-record 23rd. But he says playing at the Garden has meant \"everything\" to him.\n\n\"It's the Mecca of basketball in New York. It's the Big Apple. Being at MSG, so many guys have walked this court, basketball, entertainment, actors, musicians, everything. It has been a wide range of America, the people, to grace this floor,\" James said.\n\n\"I hope I'm like a small snippet of somebody that came through here and was able to make a little small dent from a visitor's perspective. It's always cool in here. I've always loved these fans.\"\n\nWhile not saying it was his Garden farewell, James noted, \"When the time comes it will always have a special place.\"\n\nJosh Hart added 20 points for the Knicks while All-Star guard Jalen Brunson had 12 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.\n\n\"We've just been playing together,\" Brunson said of their win streak. \"Sticking together, that's the biggest part, having each other's back holding each other accountable.\n\n“We have to continue to do that. Can't be satisfied. It's a collective effort.\"\n\nThe Knicks improved to 31-18, second in the Eastern Conference behind Detroit.\n\nThe Lakers fell to 29-19 despite 30 points from Luka Doncic and 22 from James, who was named to his record 22nd NBA All-Star Game as a reserve by NBA coaches.\n\n\"Super humbling,\" James said. \"Mad respect to the coaches. \"Playing at the latter stages of my career and still able to be an All-Star, it means a lot.\"\n\nIt was the first Laker loss of the season after leading at half-time.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 34 points and added 13 assists while Cason Wallace had a career-high 27 points with seven three-pointers as reigning champions Oklahoma City won 121-111 at Denver.\n\n\"We knew we were going to have to bring it in this building if we wanted to get a W,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said.\n\nFrench star Victor Wembanyama delivered 25 points, eight rebounds, five blocked shots, four steals and two assists to ignite San Antonio's 112-103 home triumph over Orlando.\n\nThe game was pushed back to a night contest after the Spurs (33-16) had trouble flying out of snowstorm-hit Charlotte.\n\nCleveland's Jarrett Allen scored 40 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as the Cavaliers won 130-111 at Portland.\n\nDetroit claimed the most lopsided victory in team history as Jalen Duren scored 21 points while Cade Cunningham had 18 points and 12 assists in a 130-77 rout of visiting Brooklyn.\n\nSwedish guard Pelle Larsson and Bam Adebayo each scored 20 points as host Miami ripped Chicago 134-91, the third-biggest rout in Heat history.\n\nJaylen Brown had 30 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Boston Celtics over Milwaukee 107-79.\n\nRJ Barrett scored 21 points and Brandon Ingram added 19 for Toronto in a 107-100 home victory over Utah.

    "description": "A former Minnesota Twins pitcher is headed to LA.",
    "fullText": "Left-handed pitcher Cole Irvin agreed to a minor-league deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday. The deal includes an invitation to big-league Spring Training. Irvin returns to MLB (spring training, at least) after spending the 2024 season bouncing between organizations. He then ultimately went overseas.\n\nThis move gives the Dodgers some organizational pitching depth as they sort through their options ahead of the 2026 season, looking for a third straight World Series title.\n\nIrvin last appeared in the majors in 2024 with the Minnesota Twins, where he had a brief stint. The lefty made four appearances for Minnesota, going 0-1 with a 12.27 ERA and two strikeouts across 3.2 innings. While that stint did not go well, it was just a small part of his career that has spanned multiple seasons and teams at the major-league level.\n\nThe Dodgers signed LHP Cole Irvin to a minor league deal with a spring invite, a source confirms to The Athletic. Has big league time with PHI, OAK, BAL and MIN before spending last year with the KBO’s Doosan Bears (28 GS, 4.48 ERA).@AramLeighton8 was on it.\n\n— Fabian Ardaya (@FabianArdaya) February 1, 2026\n\nAcross six MLB seasons, Irvin has logged 593 innings, tallying a 28-40 record with a 4.54 ERA and 434 strikeouts. He has appeared in 134 games (93 starts) and pitched for four different franchises during that stretch. His most notable run came with the Oakland Athletics, where he was a regular member of the rotation in 2021 and 2022, eclipsing 178 innings in each of those seasons.\n\nIrvin originally broke in with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2019 before spending time with Oakland and the Baltimore Orioles as his career progressed. His mix of starting and relief experience is part of what makes him a nice depth option for a Dodgers organization that often cycles pitchers between the majors and Triple-A throughout the season.\n\nIrvin most recently pitched overseas in the KBO with the Doosan Bears. He posted a 4.48 ERA over 144 2/3 innings while making 28 starts. That performance, while not incredible, helped put him back on the radar for the defending back-to-back champions.\n\nThe Dodgers and LHP Cole Irvin have agreed to a Minor League deal, sources tell @JustBB_Media\n\nIrvin, 32, spent last season in KBO with the Doosan Bears, where he pitched to a 4.48 ERA in 144 2/3 IP. Over parts of 6 MLB seasons (593 IP), Irvin owns a 4.54 ERA.\n\n— Aram Leighton (@AramLeighton8) February 1, 2026\n\nFor the Dodgers, Irvin is a low-risk depth option. He is not currently a projected roster piece. Los Angeles routinely stocks experienced starters on minor-league deals to protect against injuries and workload management across a long season, which could be especially important pending Blake Snell’s early-season availability. If Irvin shows enough during spring training, he could move between Triple-A and the big-league roster this season, but that would require a 40-man spot.\n\nAt 32, Irvin’s path back to major-league innings is not guaranteed, but the opportunity is a good one with the league's premier organization in the Dodgers.",

    "description": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — In their Morgan State college dorm in the mid-1990’s, Daronte Jones and Melvin Coleman stayed busy. “We did a lot of battles in Madden,” Coleman told DC News Now. “I’d be in the bed asleep it would be a Saturday and [Daronte] would walk and grab the controller and put […]",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (DC News Now) — In their Morgan State college dorm in the mid-1990’s, Daronte Jones and Melvin Coleman stayed busy.\n\n“We did a lot of battles in Madden,” Coleman told DC News Now. “I’d be in the bed asleep it would be a Saturday and [Daronte] would walk and grab the controller and put the controller by my bed and soon I’d wake up and he’d jump back in like I don’t see him and be like, ‘oh so what you calling me out?”\n\nIn January, three decades after his Madden battles as a college football player with his roommate, and many professional and college football coaching stops, Jones has been hired as the Washington Commanders new defensive coordinator.\n\nFor Jones – it’s a homecoming. He hails from Prince George’s County, where he attended Bishop McNamara high school in Forestville, Maryland.\n\nIt’s not just his college friends and teammates who remember the Madden matchups. His good friend and teammate from Bishop McNamara Mike Jones also took part in the legendary video games matchups – though he didn’t know at the time he was facing a defensive mastermind.\n\n“He’s definitely the reason why I stopped playing Madden,” Mike said. “Cause he’s reading all your plays and this was the time when he was early in his coaching career… I’m like dude I’m playing for leisure.”\n\nDuring his college career, Daronte suffered a neck injury that kept him off the field. Coleman said Daronte would spend more time in the play calling booth during games and was earning a bigger grasp of the game. He said it showed in Madden too.\n\n“That kind of helped us being coaches and our playing careers were done,” Coleman said. “We learned how to think on the run, think quick, make adjustments quick.”\n\nYou could call Daronte’s coaching career the Daronte Jones World Tour.\n\nIt started in 2001 as a graduate assistant at Division II Lenoir-Rhyne. Coleman said Daronte conducted an interview with the school before they went on their spring break trip senior year. The following years took Jones to Nicholls State (then Division I-AA) as safeties coach, defensive coordinator jobs at high schools in Louisiana and his first return to the DMV where he served as Bowie State’s assistant head coach and defensive coordinator from 2005 to 2009.\n\nJones bounced around more after that. He was cornerbacks coach at UCLA in 2010, defensive backs coach for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League in 2011, Hawaii’s secondary coach in 2012-14 and Wisconsin’s defensive backs coach in 2015.\n\nThen, Jones made the jump to the NFL — first as the Miami Dolphins assistant defensive backs coach, then the Cincinnati Bengals cornerbacks coach, then the Minnesota Vikings defensive backs coach. After a brief stint as LSU’s defensive coordinator in 2021 where he coached star cornerback Derek Stingley Jr., Jones returned to the Vikings, where he stayed until this offseason.\n\n“For most people who think that this is a person who’s coming out of nowhere, that’s not true,” Mike Jones said. “This guy has been grinding close to over 20 years. He’s been grinding and getting information from the best minds in football.”\n\nFor Mike and Coleman, watching Daronte flourish in the football world has been meaningful, but they’ve also seen his growth as a coach.\n\n“Secondary wise, pass defense wise, everywhere he’s gone they’ve gotten better,” Coleman, who is now the safeties coach at Morgan State said. “Somebody is doing well, somebody is probably making the pro bowl. Somebody is probably making all-conference. So the proof is in the work.”\n\nSince 2023, Daronte had worked directly under Brian Flores in Minnesota. Coleman said that Daronte’s coaching influences and style comes from several different legendary coaching trees.\n\n“With him being around [Vic] Fangio, Marvin Lewis, [Mike] Zimmer, Vance Joseph and now Flores,” Coleman said. “He’s got a lot work from them. He got a lot of tape to take from them.”\n\nIn recent seasons, with Daronte serving as the team’s defensive backs coach and pass game coordinator, the Vikings’ defense has played aggressively, focusing on trying to force turnovers and blitzing at some of the highest rates in the NFL.\n\nDaronte’s high school teammate Mike Jones, who is now a counselor at Bishop McNamara says the way he played was pretty similar to how his defenses play.\n\n“He was always in the right spot… When we look at those old films when we get together, he pops on film,” Mike said. “He’s always going all out.”\n\nMike said Daronte earned the nickname “Crow” because “he made crow sounds in the backfield.”\n\n“He would make these crow sounds like he’s lurking in the secondary,” Mike said. “He would take on the biggest person on the team in practice even though he was gonna get knocked down… He’s not scared.”\n\nAccording to his friends, Daronte’s days at McNamara mean a lot to him. Several years ago, Daronte donated to the Bishop McNamara football program. His contributions provide student athletes with scholarship assistance. Daronte’s name is now etched on a plaque in the McNamara locker room, noted him as a 1996 graduate and that year’s male athlete of the year. Daronte played football, wrestling and track & field at McNamara.\n\n“He’s been able to come back and give back to the community itself in terms of the program and the school,” Bishop McNamara football head coach Greg Calhoun said. “But he’s also been able to take advantage of the opportunities to give back.”\n\nCalhoun told DC News Now that he referenced Daronte as inspiration and motivation for his players and as an example to potential recruits.\n\n“I actually just had a set of recruits come through and we just showed his locker again as we always do,” Calhoun said. “A lot of great coaches out here in the world but for him to be selected for that job and that opportunity in this community, is huge.”\n\nBishop McNamara plays in one of, if not the best high school football conferences in the country, the WCAC. The Mustangs last won a WCAC championship in 1990. Since, the conference has been dominated by blue blood programs DeMatha, Gonzaga, St. John’s and Good Counsel.\n\nBut in 2025, months before Daronte being hired by the Commanders, a few seasons into his tenure in Forestville, Calhoun helped his team take a massive step forward. The Mustangs beat their rival Gonzaga, 21-0 on October 11. Gonzaga was the eventual WCAC runners-up.\n\nThe following week, McNamara fell just short to eventual undefeated WCAC champion DeMatha, 12-7. They were one of two teams to come within five points or less of the Stags all season long. It was also DeMatha’s second lowest scoring output of the season.\n\n“We’re not always the first names mentioned in that league,” Mike said. “Now we have something that we can definitely hang our hat on in conversations… Now we have the defensive coordinator of our local team.”\n\nCalhoun believes that an esteemed alum calling plays down the road, could further fuel his players.\n\n“Just knowing that you have somebody of that magnitude at that level kind of puts that pressure on you obviously as the current student in that process, just letting you know you have some big shoes to fill,” Calhoun told DC News Now. “You have some expectations, you have some standards and that’s something that we work to build here in this process and our guys take pride and value in that.”\n\nAnd while Daronte rises in the football coaching ranks, he’s still a boy from Prince George’s County, Maryland.\n\n“I know growing up, everybody was like DC, DC, DC, but now it’s like PG County,” Coleman said. “We’ve got players, we’ve got ballers, we’ve got good thinkers and I think it’s just you’re proud to represent where you’re from.”\n\nAs for what Commanders fans should expects going forward, Coleman said Daronte is “a guy that’s going to be on a mission to be great. To not lose.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini men's basketball coach Brad Underwood saw his team overcome road adversity once again, as it snagged a critical road win Sunday afternoon to extend its winning streak to 11 by overcoming a talented No.5-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers team, 78-69.\n\nIt wasn't just any win. It's a microcosm of a season marked by raw, elite talent finally gelling together as the season's critical stretch run really gets going. Sunday at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln was no different, as for the second consecutive weekend, the No.9-ranked Illini took down an AP Top 5 road opponent after doing the same against the Purdue Boilermakers in West Lafayette last Saturday.\n\nIt's the first time the Illini have done so in program history, but it came with a bit of extra motivation that has since begun to circulate in the hours after the revenge win.\n\nMore specifically, the team's whiteboard. There weren't X's and O's, nor was there a diagram explaining the ways Illinois can continue to remain atop a crowded Big Ten title race with a little over a month left in the season.\n\nInstead, it was four simple words: \"Rob the [expletive] bank.\"\n\nWhether it was a jab at the arena's name or otherwise, it certainly seemed to fire up Illinois as it now holds a win against every conference opponent it's played so far.\n\nUnderwood said his players were relaxed and composed in the second half after overcoming a 39-33 halftime deficit. The Illini outscored the Cornhuskers 45-30 in the final 20 minutes, as freshman guard Keaton Wagler finished with 28 points.\n\n“Chemistry and connectivity,\" Underwood told reporters. \"Just the communication… We’ve made huge strides there and we’re competing on every play,” Underwood said.\n\nMORE: Dusty May set the tone before tipoff and Michigan followed\n\nThe Illini are going to attempt to keep their winning streak alive Wednesday night from State Farm Center in Champaign, hosting the Northwestern Wildcats. Unlike Illinois, Northwestern has struggled to stay above .500 for much of the season and is trying to bounce back after dropping a 76-62 game to the Washington Huskies Saturday night.\n\nTip is set for 8 p.m. ET on Big Ten Network as the Illini try to sweep the season series.\n\nHubert Davis buyout, contract details as UNC Tar Heels coach\n\n'Basketball Saved My Life': Why Master P came home to rebuild New Orleans\n\nPenny Hardaway buyout, contract details as Memphis Tigers coach\n\nWhy FOX blocked St. John’s from participating in a major college basketball event",

    "description": "Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores has been one of the biggest storylines of Minnesota’s offseason. He was chasing head-coaching openings […]",
    "fullText": "Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores has been one of the biggest storylines of Minnesota’s offseason. He was chasing head-coaching openings and there were plenty of those. Furthermore, Minnesota’s defensive architect interviewed for another defensive coordinator position, which he was allowed to do because his contract had briefly expired.\n\nFirst, the Vikings handled the contract issue, reportedly offering him a Godfather deal. He agreed and signed the contract to return as the defensive coordinator in the Twin Cities with one caveat: If offered a promotion elsewhere, he would still depart.\n\nUltimately, he didn’t get any of those HC jobs. At this point, all 32 jobs are filled. On Sunday, reports surfaced suggesting that the Arizona Cardinals would hire Los Angeles Rams offensive coordinator Mike LaFleur, brother of Green Bay’s skipper. Rams head coach Sean McVay loses another staff member.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders, meanwhile, are expected to work out a deal with Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. That contract cannot be finalized until after the Super Bowl. Kubiak worked for the Vikings between 2019 and 2021, first as the QB coach and in his final season as the offensive coordinator. He was not retained when the Vikings swapped Mike Zimmer for Kevin O’Connell. In Las Vegas, Kubiak is expected to get his hands on the potential first overall pick, Fernando Mendoza.\n\nAbout a month ago, Flores was rumored to be on Tom Brady’s shortlist of head coaching candidates, but that never got beyond the rumor stage. There’s no reported interview. In fact, Flores only interviewed for two HC vacancies, with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nHis return is good news for the Vikings. The numbers support that case; he was the driving force behind the 9–8 record, often masking the flaws of an abysmal offense.\n\nIn the three years under Flores, Minnesota has allowed just 19.2 points per game, ranking second in the NFL. The advanced numbers support his brilliance, as his group ranks near the top of the league in EPA/play and DVOA. This hasn’t just been a good defense. It’s been one of the league’s elite units for two consecutive seasons.\n\nBeyond the numbers, Flores has changed the personality of the defense. Minnesota plays faster and more aggressively than it did before his arrival, leaning into disguised coverages, creative blitz packages, and constant pressure looks that force quarterbacks into mistakes. The unit rarely sits back. Instead, it dictates terms — something the Vikings had been missing for years. That identity has become one of the clearest strengths of the team.\n\nFlores took over in 2023 after three straight seasons of underwhelming defensive performance. At first, the transition took time, as the personnel didn’t perfectly fit his system and the scheme required a steep learning curve.\n\nIn the 2024 offseason, the Vikings acquired Andrew Van Ginkel, Jonathan Greenard and Blake Cashman to strengthen the front, and it worked wonders. En route to a 14-3 record, his defense gave most quarterbacks fits in his second season with the Vikings.\n\nLast year, with an additional focus on interior pass rush, his defense allowed only a single passing touchdown in the final eight games of the campaign.\n\nWith his return, there’s real hope that a few offensive improvements could turn the Vikings into a January contender behind a championship-caliber defense.\n\nThe roster should largely remain intact, aside from Harrison Smith’s expected retirement and the potential free-agent departure of linebacker Eric Wilson. On the other hand, the Vikings could acquire some reinforcements in free agency and the draft.\n\nEditor’s Note: Information from PFF, Over The Cap, and Sports Reference helped with this article.",

    "fullText": "TAMPA, Fla. — Nikita Kucherov scored the tying goal in the third period, Jake Guentzel scored the only goal in the shootout, and the Tampa Bay Lightning rallied from a four-goal deficit to beat the Boston Bruins 6-5 in front of 64,617 fans at an NHL Stadium Series game at Raymond James Stadium.\n\nKucherov finished with a goal and three assists, Brandon Hagel had a goal and two assists, while Oliver Bjorkstrand, Darren Raddysh and Nick Paul all scored power-play goals after Tampa Bay fell behind 5-1 in the second period.\n\nAndrei Vasilevskiy finished with 29 saves.\n\nTampa Bay’s four-goal comeback is the largest in NHL outdoor game history and the largest comeback victory in franchise history.\n\nMorgan Geekie had a pair of goals and three points for the Bruins. Viktor Arvidsson, Alex Steeves and Matthew Poitras also scored for Boston, which improved to 10-1-2 in the past 13 games. Charlie McAvoy had a pair of assists while Jeremy Swayman finished with 41 saves.\n\nKucherov completed Tampa Bay’s comeback with a one-timer from the left circle with 8:10 left in the third period.\n\nThe game featured the first goalie fight in outdoor game history when Vasilevskiy and Swayman exchanged blows at center ice in the second period. The Lightning pointed to the goalie fight as a spark to their comeback when they were down 5-2.\n\n“That was a game-changing moment for our team, and that’s what we needed,’’ Guentzel said. “That was definitely cool to watch.’’\n\nWith an opening puck drop temperature of 41.8 degrees Fahrenheit (5.44 Celsius), Hagel fired up the crowd with a goal just 11 seconds in — the fastest goal in NHL outdoor game history and tying a franchise history for fastest goal to start a game.\n\nThe Bruins scored the next five as Steeves, Geekie and Arvidsson all scored within a span of 7:39 to give Boston a 3-1 lead after the first. Poitras scored on a backhander at 2:22 of the second period while Geekie notched his second of the game at 8:18.\n\n“We came out strong, obviously they scored right away but we got to our game right after,’’ Geekie said.\n\nBjorkstrand scored at 10:28 to make it 5-2.\n\nThe Lightning scored a pair of five-on-three power-play goals 23 seconds apart. Raddysh scored a goal for the fourth consecutive game to set a franchise record for a defenseman. Paul then tapped in a pass from Guentzel to make it 5-4.\n\n“It was the game had everything,’’ Lightning head coach Jon Cooper said. “It had the weather in a state which doesn’t usually get weather like this. It was a phenomenal atmosphere, perfect ice hockey playing conditions. You had goalie fights, you had 11 goals, you had a shootout. It had everything. That one’s going to go in the memory bank. It was a special occasion.’’\n\nBruins: At Florida on Wednesday night.\n\nLightning: Host Buffalo on Tuesday night.",

    "title": "Fan Focus: What Can Sunderland Expect From Scott Parker’s Burnley Side Today?",
    "description": "Ahead of today’s match, we spoke to Joe of the TurfCast Podcast to discuss what to expect from Scott Parker’s side.",
    "fullText": "It seems so long ago when Burnley defeated  Sunderland back in August – how would you summarise your season since?\n\nYeah feels like a while ago doesn’t it – the season has not gone well, is an understatement. 10 points adrift by January and looking down the barrel of another relegation.\n\nScott Parker has developed a reputation for taking teams up but then struggling to keep them up. Does he still have the support of the Burnley fanbase?\n\nI can’t speak for the majority of the fan base but I do feel the majority would like a change now.\n\nWe’re 14 games without a win, and within that lost seven games in a row – it’s not good enough really.\n\nHowever we have improved slightly since then so it would be bizarre to do it now, but I wouldn’t be against it.\n\nGiven both Sunderland and Leeds at present are set to avoid relegation, has there been any frustration amongst Burnley fans that the club have weren’t more aggressive in the summer transfer window?\n\nYeah, massive. It’s not like we didn’t give it a go we just didn’t sign enough quality.\n\nI don’t think Leeds’ squad is that much better than ours though and they’ve managed to give it a proper go as they have signed that extra bit of quality and they have a manager that has now started playing on the front foot.\n\nAlthough you’re not winning games, Burnley have avoided defeat in five of your last seven matches. What is making you so tough to beat of late?\n\nI think it’s the introduction of Marcus Edwards, personally.\n\nWhy he hasn’t played more games this season is beyond me, but for whatever reason Scott Parker made him spend the majority of the season on the bench.\n\nBut since he’s come in he’s manage to relieve a bit of pressure on the defence by dragging the ball up the pitch and trying to play on the front foot – putting teams on the back foot for a few mins.\n\nWhereas before it was just constant defending with no outlet, no pressure being taken off the defence and eventually it would crack.\n\nBurnley are set to sign James Ward-Prowse on loan from Nottingham Forest – what do you think he will bring to the table?\n\nSet-pieces is the obvious answer – he hasn’t actually scored a free kick for a while in the Premier League admittedly but he’s good with corners too which is something we have struggled with.\n\nHe will probably replace the injured Josh Cullen in the midfield alongside Florentino Luis. He does improve us I have no doubt about that, but our main issues have been upfront and the back.\n\nNow we’re over halfway into the season, which players have impressed you most and who would you say has been underwhelming?\n\nMartin Dubravka has been class since coming in during the summer. He’s kept us in so many games, I genuinely feel we would be below Wolves if we had a different keeper in the net.\n\nUnderwhelming has got to be Maxime Esteve, although he has got better in the last few games he came into this season with a brilliant reputation after a great season in the Championship, but he’s made quite a few mistakes this season and been caught out a lot.\n\nIf you were Regis Le Bris, how would you exploit Burnley’s weaknesses?\n\nPlay on the front foot, get us under pressure, make the defence work and eventually someone will make a stupid mistake and give you a chance – the amount of chances we have given away from our own stupid play is ridiculous.\n\nHow do you think Parker will set up tactically at the Stadium of Light?\n\nIt will be five at the back, annoyingly. I think we have looked better with four at the back personally but Parker is far too cautious.\n\nI wouldn’t mind if we could play five at the back well but our wing-backs don’t have the pace and the centre backs are often caught out leaving us exposed.\n\nAre any players missing and what do you think the starting XI will be?\n\nI’m writing this before the press conference but as fare as I’m aware there’s about 7 players missing, including captain Josh Cullen, Zian Flemming and Joe Worrall.\n\nI imagine the starting line up would be Dubravka, Walker, Tuanzebe, Esteve, Humphreys, Pires, Big Les, Luis, Edwards, Anthony, and Foster.\n\nRomaine Mundle scored the winner when the two sides last met at the Stadium of Light – what is your prediction for the score this time around?\n\nI think it will be a tight game as it always seems to be when it comes to us two – but based on how well you have done this season I think. you come out on top – Xhaka missing does give me some hope but I still feel you have enough to beat us. 2-1 Sunlun.",

The lad has loads of class, and I think it would help massively.\n\nBurnley have managed to go three games unbeaten — although they haven’t won a game since October — so we should be going hard and making sure we’re on top at home.\n\nI think we will have too much for Burnley, in front of our fans. We were given a reality check in the reverse fixture back in August, so it’s time we repaid the favour with a strong showing.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Burnley 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Brian Brobbey\n\nThat defeat at West Ham stung because we never really got going, but being back at home usually snaps us out of that.\n\nBurnley haven’t won since October, but have drawn their last three. They’ve become more resilient but can’t pick up three points for the life of them, so if we start with a bit of intent, the game’s there for us.\n\nBrobbey should enjoy himself against their centre halves, and I think he scores to help us on our way.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 1 Burnley 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Brian Brobbey\n\nPutting our West Ham disappointment behind us, we face one of the six sides to have beaten us this season.\n\nBurnley’s return to the Premier League has been the struggle everyone expected of us, with three wins all season, — the last of which came way back in October.\n\nIt would be typical for us to go unbeaten at home to this point, and lose to a side on a fourteen-game winless streak, wouldn’t it?\n\nOne thing I’ll say is that after every defeat, we’ve followed it up well and I’ll back that to happen again tonight — but I don’t envisage a classic!\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 4 Burnley 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Lord Daniel Ballard\n\nI’m over-confident for this one, I’m aware, but I feel like Burnley will turn up thinking they have our number and that our boys know that they’re fully capable of having these over a barrel — particularly at the Stadium of Light.\n\nIt’s all about when the first goal is scored, but I reckon we’ll be 2-0 up before half time.\n\nSo 4-0 I’m going for. I don’t care if it’s overconfidence — I’m not doing very well anyway!\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 1 Burnley 1\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Brian Brobbey\n\nGranit Xhaka was obviously a key miss but the last match was unfortunately a stark reminder that there are no easy fixtures in the Premier League and if we’re not 100% at the races in every department, it’s unforgiving and we’ll come away empty-handed more often than not.\n\nBurnley haven’t quite turned the corner by any means, but draws in their last three league games against Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham make this a far from straightforward affair.\n\nIt looks like we’ll be without our influential skipper again so it could be a tough night, but this also represents an opportunity for the team to prove — in front of the Sky cameras — they aren’t as reliant on him as people think.\n\nI back our levels of commitment and organisation and I expect to see a change in personnel, but it’s the lack of consistent quality attacking play that leaves this one in the balance for me.\n\nI can see Brobbey continuing his run of goals but I’m not sure it’ll be enough to take all three points.\n\nScore prediction: Sunderland 2 Burnley 0\n\nSunderland’s first goalscorer: Enzo Le Fée\n\nWell last Saturday was a bit crap. During the first half especially, we looked lost without our talisman Granit Xhaka and West Ham probably couldn’t believe their luck.\n\nBurnley’s last three league results have been draws against Spurs, Liverpool and Manchester United, so they’ll be stubborn and be desperate to take our unbeaten home record.\n\nHopefully with the players been given a deserved few days’ break and most of them grabbing some winter sun, they’ll be refreshed, ready to go again, and to recapture their form from the start of the season.\n\nThe less we say about last weekend, the better.\n\nOur first half desire was left wanting, and before we knew it we were 3-0 down to a couple of avoidable goals and a wonder strike.\n\nWe did better in the second half with a well-created and taken goal for our number nine, but apart from Luke O’Nien hitting the crossbar corner with a cross-come-shot, we didn’t really get super close to making it a nervous finish to the game.\n\nIt was our first foray without Granit Xhaka, and if anything maybe it was useful to lose like that away from home in order to give the Lads a kick up the arse, as we probably have a couple more fixtures without the skipper to come.\n\nTonight, we have to rub our skinned knees, get back on the bike and show the fans that it was one of a few bad days away from the Stadium of Light.\n\nNone of the RR writers went for a loss and only two thought we would draw, so no points for right score or outcome.\n\nEveryone bar Jack picked Brian Brobbey to get us our first and in this case only goal, so seven of the lads get a point, and Jack gets nothing.\n\nEveryone takes one point more apart from Jack, so the table stays as was, but Martin and those below him caught up on Jack a wee bit.\n\nGair gets into double figures, which is worth a mention for sure.\n\nJust a quick reminder of how we allocate points to our match-by-match predictions:\n\nCorrect outcome (but not correct score) = One point\n\nCorrect first Sunderland goalscorer = One point (no goalscorer is a valid call)\n\nPossible deductions for being lazy and not submitting on time = a two-point deduction.",

    "description": "In a potential sliding doors moment was it this defeat at Reading that was the beginning of the end for O’Neill?",
    "fullText": "With Martin O’Neill getting Celtic back on track north of the border, it’s difficult not to think back on his time as manager of Sunderland – and think what a bloody shame it was that it didn’t work out.\n\nThinking back, it was potentially a case of being the right man at the wrong time. Maybe if he had been appointed when Niall Quinn gave him that call a few years earlier, it might have all been different – but then again, we got Roy Keane, so it kind of worked out.\n\nIt’s very easy when talking about his time at Sunderland to try and work out the point where it began to go in the wrong direction, because his appointment in December 2011 gave us the lift we needed. Steve Bruce had a shocking ending the season prior and began 2011-12 with just two wins in the first thirteen league games, that include a home defeat against the visitors, which left us hovering dangerously above the drop zone.\n\nEnter stage left, O’Neill, who had been looking for a job after leaving Aston Villa. After Seb Larsson scored that winner in his opening game at the Stadium of Light against Blackburn Rovers, he won seven in his first ten league games – and not only that, he also won three cup ties in his first three months to reach the quarter-final of the FA Cup.\n\nNow, that quarter-final. In the first game at Goodison, we were brilliant, and David Moyes was lucky to get another crack at Sunderland in the replay. We’d just beaten Liverpool at home ahead of the replay, so all seemed well. But it was disastrous. Everton rolled us over and, well, we were awful, and maybe as a consequence, we didn’t win any of the remaining eight games of the season.\n\nBut, new season, new hope, and all of that.\n\nHowever, O’Neill was told that the purse strings wouldn’t be opened and he’d have to pretty much make do – something he has said since would have probably steered him away from taking the job on in the first place. Two free transfers made their debut in the opening day goalless draw against Arsenal at the Emirates, with Carlos Cuellar in the starting XI and Louis Saha making an appearance from the bench.\n\nWe won just two of the first fifteen games.\n\nThere was, however, a mini-revival as we bounced back to win five of the next eight games, which propelled us back up to the safety of mid-table, just as Swansea City travelled to the Stadium of Light in the final game within the January transfer window.\n\nThe game against the Swans would end in a goalless draw, but perhaps the most significant event of the night was Danny Graham entering the field of play as a substitute for the final fifteen minutes of the game, as he was in talks to sign for Sunderland in a deal worth around £5m.\n\nNext up was a trip to the Madejski Stadium to take on Brian McDermott’s Reading, who were nine points behind us and only out of the relegation zone via goal difference. Graham was named on the bench by O’Neill after his transfer was confirmed ahead of the game, and less than ten minutes into the gam,e most people assumed his services would be required at some point.\n\nThis was due to Jimmy Kebe’s opener, which arrived after seven minutes, after good work from Jobi McAniff cutting the ball across the box. Kebe wrong-footed the Sunderland defence to provide time to pick his spot to score past Simon Mignolet from around ten yards out.\n\nBut O’Neill’s Sunderland fought back, and Adam Federici was forced into good saves to deny Alfred N’Diaye and Larsson, but just before the half hour, the Lads were awarded a penalty. Pavel Pogrebnyak was adjudged to have fouled John O’Shea when defending a corner, and Craig Gardner levelled things up from the spot.\n\nBoth sides pushed to take maximum points, and with ten minutes to go, O’Neill brought off Stephane Sessegnon and sent on his new signing from Swansea City – and “a huge roar from the travelling Sunderland fans greeted Graham”.\n\nAlmost immediately, it paid off, but Graham’s close-range header was brilliantly saved to concede a corner – it could all have been so different had that gone in.\n\nBecause the sucker punch came with five minutes to go. Sunderland gave away a sloppy free-kick, and everyone’s favourite agent Ian Harte swung the ball in, and it was met by the head of Keb,e who scored his second goal of the game, which turned out to be the winner.\n\nA point would have seen us take a place in the top half of the Premier League, but instead we lost four and drew two in the next six games, and O’Neill was sacked as manager of Sunderland.\n\nSunderland: Mignolet, Gardner, O’Shea, Bramble, Colback, Larsson (Rose), N’Diaye, Vaughan (McClean), Johnson, Sessegnon (Graham), Fletcher Subs: Westwood, Bardsley, Mangane, Wickham\n\nReading: Federici, Kelly, Harte, Leigertwood, Pearce, Mariappa, Kebe, Akpan, Pogrebnyak (Blackman), McAnuff, McCleary (Le Fondre) Subs: Taylor, Shorey, Morrison, Karacan, Guthrie",

    "description": "Top 10: The Second World War Fighters Souped-Up for Extreme Air Racing",
    "fullText": "Reno Air Racing, described as ‘the world’s fastest motorsport’, is a blistering blend of aviation heritage, extreme engineering and thrilling speed.\n\nHeld in the Nevada desert, it pits legendary warbirds against one another in low-level, high-G duels around a pylon course. These aircraft, once icons of combat, are now stripped, clipped and polished to extremes.\n\nEngines are souped-up, wings shortened, cooling systems re-engineered — all in the relentless pursuit of speed. Prop tips blur, exhausts roar, and pilots skim the desert floor, often at over 450 mph. It’s not just racing; it’s the ultimate fusion of history, danger, and adrenaline.\n\nThe Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, famed for its shark-mouthed nose art and rugged wartime service, found a second life roaring over Reno’s desert skies. Once a symbol of wartime grit, it became a rare but thrilling sight among the sleek Mustangs and Bearcats dominating the Unlimited Class air races.\n\nUnlike the supercharged, high-altitude racers built later in the war, the P-40E was a tough, low-to-mid-altitude fighter, never the fastest — but its broad wings, throaty Allison engine, and unmistakable silhouette made it unforgettable. Racers who chose the Warhawk prized its stability and character, favouring heritage over outright performance.\n\nTo compete, mechanics stripped out armour, guns, and unnecessary weight, tuned the Allison V-1710 for maximum output, and polished every inch of its metal to minimise drag. Some even fitted larger props and fuel tweaks, wringing every last knot from its classic frame. The transformation kept the Warhawk’s soul but pushed its limits.\n\nP‑40s have occasionally raced at Reno, often in the Bronze or Unlimited classes. Airframes like Texas Warhawk (2017) reached qualifying speeds near 292 mph, with race speeds around 270 mph.\n\nThe F8F Bearcat was the ultimate example of Grumman’s pantheon of piston-engined naval fighters. The company’s earlier Hellcat had been instrumental in defeating Japan, and the Bearcat was even more potent. Compact, with immaculate handling, the F8F was utterly brilliant.\n\nLong before the Bearcat had entered the realm of racing, it snatched the absolute climb rate record for piston-engined aircraft, whizzing up to 10,000 feet in 94 seconds in 1946. Fast and with a strong structure that lent itself to modification, the Bearcat was a ripe candidate for the Reno races.\n\nRare Bear is a heavily modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, rebuilt by pilot Lyle Shelton from a crashed airframe in 1969 for air racing. Fitted with a powerful Wright R-3350 radial engine producing over 4000 horsepower, it became one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft ever built.\n\nIn 1989, Rare Bear set a 3 km (1.86 mile) world speed record of 528.33 mph (850.26 km/h). With shortened wings, aerodynamic refinements, and distinctive “bear” artwork, it dominated the Unlimited Class at the Reno Air Races.\n\nThere is much debate over what the ultimate piston-engined fighter was; some offer the P-51H, P-47N, or other types for this prestigious, subjective ranking, but the two most common candidates are the American Grumman Bearcat and the British Hawker Sea Fury. This sense of rivalry between these two brilliant radial-engined naval fighters carries on over eighty years after their first flights. Though the Sea Fury did not serve in the war, we will include it as it took its first flight in 1945.\n\nThe Hawker Sea Fury T.Mk 20 Dreadnought began life as a two-seat Royal Navy trainer, designed to familiarise pilots with the high-powered radial engine and handling characteristics of the single-seat fighter variants. When converted for air racing, Dreadnought underwent extensive modifications.\n\nThe rear seat was removed, structural reinforcements were added, and a Pratt & Whitney R‑4360 radial engine, producing around 3,800 hp, replaced the standard powerplant. These changes enabled the aircraft to safely handle extreme speeds and high g-forces on the pylon course while maintaining control over its large airframe.\n\nDreadnought reached qualifying speeds of 452.7 mph (according to unofficial sources) in 1986 and, piloted by Joel Swager in 2018, achieved a Gold Unlimited victory at Reno with a race speed of 417.735 mph. Over its career, it accumulated multiple wins and several second-place finishes, demonstrating remarkable consistency and reliability despite its size. The September Fury is another Hawker Sea Fury turned Reno Unlimited racer.\n\nThe Vought F4U Corsair, (and the Goodyear F2G Super Corsair) is a legendary Second World War naval fighter, famed for its distinctive inverted gull wings and powerful Pratt & Whitney radial engine. It served with the United States Navy and Marines in the Pacific, excelling in both air‑to‑air combat and ground‑attack roles, reaching speeds of around 446 mph in standard military form (we’ve used a wartime Corsair image here).\n\nIts combination of agility, firepower, and durability made it a favourite among pilots and a feared adversary in the skies, cementing its place in aviation history. The Corsair at Reno is a rare and captivating sight, one of the few warbirds of its kind to race in the Unlimited Class. Its presence is significant because very few Corsairs were ever modified or maintained for competitive racing, making it a true gem for air-race enthusiasts.\n\nAt the Reno Air Races, modified Corsairs proved remarkable in the Unlimited Class. The F4U‑derived Super Corsair N31518, piloted by Steve Hinton, won the Unlimited Gold in 1985, averaging 438.186 mph over the eight‑lap course. Goodyear F2G N5588N, known as Race 57, was restored and entered competition in 1999, achieving impressive results.\n\nTheir participation was rare, as few Corsairs were ever adapted for racing, and each airframe brought both historical significance and thrilling performance to the event. The aircraft’s gull wings give it instant charisma. Despite a relative scarcity of usable photographs, the Corsair’s speed rand rarity prestige make it an essential inclusion on our list.\n\n‘Steadfast’ began life as one of a batch of 10 modern Yak-3Us built in the early 2000s in Romania by Avioane Craiova. The original Yak-3U was an experimental Yak-3 development fitted with a radial ASh-82 engine in place of the usual V-12 Klimov which did not enter production but several replicas have been built.\n\nMost replicas destined for owners in the west received R-1830 engines but when Will Whiteside acquired this Yak as an unfinished, engineless, potential racer project, he decided to install a rather more potent Pratt & Whitney R-2000, as fitted to the DC-4, but tuned to deliver 1750hp.\n\nCompared to most Reno racers, 1750hp doesn’t sound that much but the Yak airframe is light, small and streamlined. Steadfast (a name derived from Reno’s Stead airport and the intention to go fast) raced at Reno for six years and attained first place in the Unlimited Silver in 2012.\n\nThe aircraft benefited from significant aerodynamic work to remove drag, it utilises an oversized spinner (from an A-26) and an afterspinner to smooth airflow through the cowling Steadfast ultimately set nine speed and climb records, including the speed record for its class at 416mph. Since 2017 Steadfast has been based in New Zealand.\n\nThe P‑51 Mustang became a common choice for air racers in America due to the large number of surplus airframes available after World War II. Its robust design, high-speed potential, and adaptability made it ideal for conversion into Unlimited Class racers, and “Strega” emerged as one of the most successful and recognisable examples.\n\nStrega, a highly modified P‑51D, dominated the Reno Air Races for decades. Powered by a tuned Packard Merlin engine producing over 3000 hp, it could reach qualifying speeds exceeding 500 mph.\n\nIts aerodynamic refinements, including clipped wings, polished surfaces, and custom cooling systems, allowed it to maintain exceptional control through tight pylon turns at extreme velocities, a key factor in its repeated victories.\n\nOver its racing career, Strega won the Unlimited Gold Class multiple times, often competing head-to-head with other top Mustangs like Dago Red and Precious Metal. Its consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps made it a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining World War 2-era airframes with modern engineering and tuning.\n\nBeyond speed, Strega’s legacy lies in its influence on piston-engine racing. Its dominance highlighted the advantages of the P‑51 platform, inspiring other racers to optimise weight, aerodynamics, and power to compete at the highest levels of the Reno Air Races.\n\nDago Red is a North American P‑51 Mustang (44‑74996) restored as a competitive air racer by Frank Taylor in 1981. Taylor piloted Dago Red to numerous world records and championship victories during the 1980s. In 1983 at Mojave, California, the aircraft set a 15 km world speed record of 517.323 mph, highlighting its extreme performance and engineering.\n\nOver its racing career, Dago Red achieved repeated success at the Reno Air Races, including winning the Gold Unlimited class in 1982. It secured the Thompson Trophy in 2003 with a fastest lap of 512.164 mph and fastest race speed of 507.105 mph.\n\nIn 2001, it recorded the fastest qualifying speed at Reno at 497.797 mph. Across two decades, Dago Red won the National Championship Air Races six times (1982, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003), cementing its reputation as one of the premier piston-engine racers in the world.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by a race-tuned Rolls-Royce Merlin V12, estimated at 3500–3800 hp, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard paddle propeller. Its lightweight 7200 lb empty weight and 32 ft wingspan allow it to handle tightly around pylons at extreme speeds. With a maximum speed exceeding 520 mph and a rate of climb of 8,000 ft/min, Dago Red remains a benchmark in air racing, demonstrating the pinnacle of Mustang performance and Taylor’s piloting skill.\n\nThe P‑51XR, known as Precious Metal, was built in 1988 for high-speed air racing and should not be confused with the original P‑51D or the replica Precious Metal II. It is one of the most radical and exciting modified Mustangs ever created, combining a classic airframe with extreme engineering.\n\nIt retained the P‑51 fuselage but incorporated a Rolls‑Royce Griffon 57A engine producing dramatically more horsepower than the original Merlin. To handle the immense torque, it used contra-rotating propellers from an Avro Shackleton (the same Griffon/contra arrangement was tested on the cancelled MB5 fighter), significantly improving stability and allowing pilots to exploit full power without losing control during tight pylon turns at Reno.\n\nThis mighty propulsion system combined with structural reinforcements to cope with the Griffon’s power, made Precious Metal one of the most capable and aggressive piston-engine racers ever built, pushing a WWII-era fighter far beyond its original limits.\n\nIts debut at the 1988 Reno Air Races immediately marked it as a contender, though early mechanical issues limited performance. Over time, it earned multiple podium finishes in the Unlimited Class, including a sixth-place finish in the Gold race. As an intriguing aside, the wartime Martin-Baker MB5 also adopted a Griffon/contra arrangement, a spectacular fighter prototype that did not enter production.\n\nThe Red Baron, a heavily modified P‑51D Mustang (NX7715C / 44‑84961), became one of the most iconic competitors in the Reno Air Races. Originally entered under various names, including Race #5 “Miss RJ” and “Roto‑Finish,” it was later reborn as Red Baron, with extensive modifications to maximise speed and performance.\n\nFrom its earliest appearances in 1966, the aircraft demonstrated competitive potential, qualifying 10th at 283.770 mph and finishing 5th in the consolation race at 304.990 mph. By 1968, Red Baron had established itself as a serious contender, qualifying 1st at 379.650 mph and finishing 2nd in the championship race at 386.852 mph. Subsequent years saw further improvements, and by 1971 it qualified 1st at 419.501 mph, finishing 4th in the championship at 412.101 mph.\n\nThe aircraft’s performance improvements came from detailed engineering modifications: the airframe was lightened by removing non-essential equipment, the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was race-tuned to over 3,500 hp, and aerodynamic refinements—including a custom four-blade Hamilton Standard propeller, polished surfaces, and modified control surfaces—reduced drag while increasing stability through tight pylon turns.\n\nThough we have focused on the hardware, the pilot skills demonstrated by the Reno pilots is masterly. Competitors needed precise throttle management and exacting handling to safely maintain speeds exceeding 400 mph near the ground. Red Baron’s consistent podium finishes and record-setting laps cemented its place as one of the most formidable Unlimited Class racers in Reno history.\n\nThe North American P‑51D Mustang Voodoo, piloted by Steve Hinton Jr., is widely recognised as the fastest piston‑engine propeller aircraft in the world. Its record-breaking performance at the Reno Air Races showcased the incredible potential of carefully modified warbirds. Every detail, from aerodynamics to engine tuning, was optimised for sheer speed.\n\nOn 2 September 2017, Voodoo achieved an astonishing average speed of 531.64 mph (855.59 km/h) over the three‑kilometre course. This feat required not only a meticulously prepared aircraft but a pilot of extraordinary skill and courage.\n\nThe Mustang’s balance of power, control, and agility made it perfect for the tight, high-speed turns of Reno’s Unlimited Class racing. Voodoo's crowning moment came in 1972, when it won the championship race at 416.160 mph.\n\nLater modifications, including a Rolls‑Royce Griffon engine and contra‑rotating propellers, pushed the aircraft to new extremes, achieving 1st-place qualifying at 427 mph and winning the championship at 415 mph in 1978.\n\nFollow Joe Coles on Substack, Twitter X  or Blue Sky.

    "fullText": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz thinks he might get a small kangaroo tattooed on one leg.\n\nIt would be a lasting memento of his win over Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open men's final Sunday which made him the youngest male player at 22 to complete a career Grand Slam.\n\n“I already know it’s going to be a kangaroo. I just don’t know the place,” Alcaraz said. “I’m just thinking about the leg but I don’t know which calf, whether it will be the right or left one.”\n\nAlcaraz posed for photographers Monday with the ornate Australian Open trophy, looking casually stylish in black, in loafers and no socks. The photo shoot took place at the Royal Exhibition Building among gardens in central Melbourne.\n\nThe women's singles winner Elena Rybakina was photographed with her trophy Saturday on the banks of the Yarra River, which runs through Melbourne.\n\nAccording to Australian media reports, Alcaraz spent the night after his victory with his family in his hotel suite, ordering pizza, beer and champagne.\n\nIn a social media post to fans during the photo shoot, Alcaraz said “I still can't believe that I just made it.\n\n“A dream come true for me, a career Grand Slam. I'm enjoying this amazing moment. I can't forget the support and the love I've received.”\n\nAfter completing a 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 over Djokovic, a 10-time Australian Open champion, Alcaraz admitted “I hate to lose.”\n\nHe explained his mindset at the moment of victory.\n\n“Before the last point ... a lot of things came to my mind, to be honest,” Alcaraz said. “I was really nervous, I was shaking almost. So once I saw the ball go out, I was like ‘alright, I made it.’\n\n“It was a great feeling, thinking about my family and my team as well.”\n\nHe has now set his sights of winning every major prize in tennis: three Masters 1000 titles that have eluded him, a season-ending championship and a Davis Cup with Spain. He has won six of the nine Masters 1000 crowns but has yet to win the Canadian Open, Shanghai and the Paris Masters.\n\n“I hate to lose, so that’s my motivation. Trying to lose as less as I can,” Alcaraz said. “Yeah, there are some tournaments that I really wanted to win at least once. A few Masters 1000 I just really wanted to complete all the Masters 1000, trying to win each one at least once.\n\n“Obviously the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup is a goal as well. I really wanted to achieve that for my country, for Spain. I set up some other goals for the season and I will try to be ready for, or to try to get those goals.”\n\nAlcaraz joined Don Budge, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic as only the ninth man to win all four Grand Slams. He was younger than Budge by 91 days and considerably younger than Nadal who was 24 and three months, Federer almost 28 and Djokovic 29.\n\n“I’m going to say tennis really beautiful but the bad part of tennis is we have tournaments week after week after week and sometimes you don’t realize what you’ve been doing lately,” he said. “Because once you finish a tournament, you’ve got to be prepared and your mind is about going to the next tournament.\n\n“What I’ve learned this year is to appreciate and enjoy every single second of the moment you’re living. Not only lifting the trophies but playing tournaments, playing tennis, getting victories, getting losses. Whatever it is, just enjoy and appreciate the life you’re living.”\n\nWhile Alcaraz has acknowledged the 38-year-old Djokovic as an inspiration, he's not sure he will be as durable.\n\n“You know, let’s see how long I will be playing. Hopefully being in such a great shape at 38, competing and challenging the young players, and playing finals of grand slams.”\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

    "fullText": "Kingdom Arena is no stranger to hosting heavyweight bouts, and Monday night’s clash between Al Hilal and Al Ahli is the main event of another epic round of Roshn Saudi League action.\n\nAfter opening a seven-point lead at the summit, back-to-back draws for Al Hilal has seen that advantage cut to only three points and, with eight wins on the bounce, Al Ahli arrive as the RSL’s form team ready to throw the season wide open.\n\nVictory would see the Jeddah giants draw level with Al Hilal at the summit, while an Al Hilal triumph would keep their rivals at bay and cement them as the team to beat this campaign.\n\nMatches don’t come any bigger than this; just cast the mind back to the corresponding fixture this season and that epic \"crazy, wild\" Al Ahli comeback. Conveniently, here are five areas in which this return blockbuster bout will be decided.\n\nThe key battles aren’t just confined to the 22 players on the pitch; the tactical battle between two of the sharpest minds in the RSL will be just as compelling.\n\nIt’s not just the Riyadh-Jeddah divide that separates the coaches, - they also come from different generations, different countries and different schools of football. However, they share a common trait in that both are proven winners.\n\nWhile each has a clear philosophy, both Inzaghi and Jaissle have demonstrated over several years an adaptability and flexibility with their tactics to achieve the ultimate result.\n\nOn the grand stage on Monday, expect both to come armed with more than just one trick up their sleeve to get the upper hand.\n\nNow both in their third season in the RSL, the rival goalkeepers are still at the absolute top of their game, with Mendy ranked No.1 in the 2025-26 RSL for clean sheets, keeping seven in his 11 games this season, while Bono isn’t far behind, with four.\n\nPerhaps most intriguingly, the two come head-to-head again just two weeks after meeting in one of the most memorable Africa Cup of Nations finals in living memory.\n\nOn that occasion, it was Mendy who came out on top, saving a late penalty before Senegal went on to win in dramatic fashion in extra-time. Can CAF Goalkeeper of the Year Bono exact a slice of revenge back in club football?\n\nNo striker in the league is as hot as Toney right now, with 13 goals in his past eight games and, incredibly, two hat-tricks in his past three.\n\nThen factor in his record against Al Hilal, with five goals in his past two games against the Riyadh giants, including a treble in their last clash at Kingdom Arena, in March. Stopping the Englishman is priority No.1, two, and three for Al Hilal.\n\nIn good news for Inzaghi, the match will see Koulibaly return from injury - the 2025 AFCON winner’s availability timely for a side that has gone five games without keeping a clean sheet.\n\nIt’s often said that matches are won in midfield, and this should be exactly where the momentum of this mammoth encounter will be set. Time and again, Neves has demonstrated his importance to this Al Hilal side, just as he did last time out against Al Qadsiah.\n\nWhether it’s controlling the tempo, his passing into the final third or his set-piece delivery, when Al Hilal win it’s usually on the back of a strong Neves performance. The same is also true of Kessie and his impact on Al Ahli: the Ivorian brings big-game know-how and huge leadership.\n\nGetting on top in midfield will be crucial in deciding the outcome of this one, and Al Ahli have shown - both in recent league matches and on the continent - they are more than capable of going toe-to-toe in that area of the park.\n\nTwo of the league’s most mercurial players, this is a showdown of the superstars. Both Al Dawsari and Mahrez are the barometers for their sides, players that offer that spark of creativity to break a game open.\n\nAl Dawsari showed all his brilliance last time out with a spectacular 90th-minute equaliser against Al Qadsiah, after earlier winning a penalty with some trademark quick feet in the box.\n\nMahrez, meanwhile, has a wand of a left foot. His first-time touch and control to set up Toney’s opener against Al Ettifaq was exquisite in its apparent ease - to Mahrez, at least.\n\nWhich player will land the knockout blow at Kingdom Arena?",

    "description": "Former WBA super lightweight champion Valenzuela had to overcome some adversity in his Zuffa Boxing debut.",
    "fullText": "Jose \"Rayo\" Valenzuela had to overcome some adversity in his Zuffa Boxing debut.\n\nValenzeula fought through a horrible cut to win a wide unanimous decision over Diego Torres in the headliner of Zuffa Boxing 2 on Sunday night at Meta Apex in Las Vegas.\n\nValenzuela was awarded nine out of 10 rounds on all three of the judges' scorecards for his return to 135 pounds. It was the first time the former WBA super lightweight champion had fought since losing his title to Gary Antuanne Russell this past March in New York.\n\nA worrisome cut opened up over the right eye of Valenzuela (15-3, 9 KOs) in Round 4, courtesy of a left hook from Torres.\n\nJose Valenzuela has a horrible cut in Round 4 as a result of a punch from Torres! pic.twitter.com/LVYcu6B1Iu\n\n— Tokkerū (@ATokkers5) February 2, 2026\n\nTorres (22-2, 19 KOs), who had won four fights in a row since being stopped by current IBF lightweight champion Raymond Muratalla in late 2023, pressured Valenzuela in the first half of the fight. Despite Valenzuela only being awarded a single round in the contest, the first half of the bout was evenly contested, with both men getting off some of their punches.\n\nEven after suffering a cut, Valenzuela seemed to go up a level in the second half of the contest. Torres' output slowed in the later rounds, which allowed Valenzuela to time Torres' attacks and counter him effectively. The former champion was able to walk Torres into southpaw left hands. Torres' lack of head movement meant that he took power shots from Valenzuela on his gloves, which had an accumulative effect over time, as Torres was taking some of the power out of the punches, but they were still having an impact.\n\nValenzuela's experience at the world level was the difference. He wasn't overwhelmed by Torres' aggression, and instead was aware that if he weathered an early storm, his own speed and silky skills would take over after Torres' initial surge — and that is exactly what happened.\n\n\"I never got handouts,\" Valenzuela said after his win. \"I'm just used to taking hard fights. Life's been hard, and I don't look for easy routes. My opponent — I want to [thank him]. I appreciate him for taking this fight. He's a dog, he only had one loss, and he showed why he's so tough today.\"\n\nIn the night's co-feature, Serhii Bohachuk (27-3, 24 KOs) returned to winning ways with a split decision victory over the former WBA (Regular) welterweight beltholder Radzhab Butaev (15-2, 12 KOs).\n\nBohachuk and Butaev produced a thoroughly entertaining 10-round, close-range slugfest. Butaev, who hadn't fought at the world level for four years and was stepping up two weight classes from his last significant fight, clearly felt the pace and non-stop pressure offered by Bohachuk, which caused him to slow down in the second half of the bout.\n\nAlthough Butaev was landing the harder shots on the inside, Bohachuk set a frenetic pace and sustained it for the 10-round period. Butaev retreated to the back foot for much of the second half of the bout, choosing to counter Bohachuk coming in and picking his shots rather than trying to match Bohachuk's volume and going punch for punch with him.\n\nIt was a tight contest, but the stronger finish from Bohachuk nudged him in front.\n\n🚨 BOHACHUK EDGES BUTAEV IN WAR \n\n✅ Serhii Bohachuk wins a split decision (96-94, 94-96, 96-94) over Radzhab Butaev in a action-packed 10-round middleweight fight. pic.twitter.com/UD7xgm0BzG\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) February 2, 2026\n\nIn the main card opener, Radivoje Kalajdzic (30-3, 21 KOs) produced a stunning turnaround victory over ex-WBC light heavyweight titlist Oleksandr Gvozdyk (21-3, 17 KOs).\n\nIt was an ideal start for Gvozdyk, who floored Kalajdzic in Round 1 with a left-hook-to-right-hand two-piece. Gvozdyk was seemingly proving to be too skilled for Kalajdzic, as he consistently found a home for power shots upstairs. In Round 4, it was a right hand to the body that sank Kalajdzic to the canvas for a second time. Although Kalajdzic beat the count, his defense was clearly letting him down, and Gvozdyk appeared well on his way to a stoppage victory.\n\nBut in Round 7, Kalajdzic produced a shocking comeback, rocking Gvozdyk in the final minute with a second right hand that floored the former champion. Gvozdyk rose from the canvas only to succumb to another right hand that sent him down for a second time. Gvozdyk tried to get to his feet, but he stumbled back onto the ring ropes, which forced the referee to stop the fight.\n\nAt the time of the stoppage, Kalajdzic had lost every round on two scorecards and was awarded just one round on the third card.\n\n‼️ Radivoje Kalajdzic gets knocked down twice, loses every round and then drops Oleksandr Gvozdyk twice in Round 7 and stops him. What a comeback!pic.twitter.com/8YfOvwLYB0\n\n— EverythingBoxing | Darshan Desai (@EverythingBoxi2) February 2, 2026\n\nOverall, Zuffa Boxing's second card was a marked improvement from the first show.

    "description": "BBC Sport Wales looks at key moments in the history of the world third oldest football association, formed in Wrexham on 2 February, 1876.",
    "fullText": "It is perhaps little wonder that Wrexham can feel like the centre of Welsh football given it was the birthplace of the Football Association of Wales (FAW).\n\nOn 2 February, 1876 only the third football association in the world was formed following a meeting at the town's Wynnstay Arms Hotel.\n\nLlewelyn Kendrick, a solicitor, was appointed chairman with Hawley Edwards taking the role of treasurer.\n\nA century and a half later the FAW is unrecognisable from the association established in the three story Georgian red-brick hotel that still stands in the centre of Wrexham today.\n\nBBC Sport Wales looks back at the most significant moments in the association's history.\n\n'Welsh wizard' Wilson targets Europe and World Cup\n\nA warrior touched by tragedy - Terry Yorath obituary\n\nFAW chief executive Mooney extends contract to 2030\n\nFounded three years after the Scottish Football Association (SFA) and 13 after the FA in England, the FAW is the third oldest football association in the world.\n\nSome seven weeks later - on 25 March, 1876 - the Wales men's team played their first international match, losing 4-0 away to Scotland at Partick.\n\nA year later, Scotland travelled to Wrexham and beat Wales 2-0 in their first home international at the Racecourse Ground - now named Stok Cae Ras - which remains the oldest international football stadium still in use.\n\nWales had to wait four years until 1881 for their first victory when John Vaughan scored the only goal to clinch a 1-0 win over England in Blackburn.\n\nThe 1950s marked a golden era for the Wales men's team, featuring iconic players such as John and Mel Charles, Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Trevor Ford and Terry Medwin.\n\nWorld Cup qualification was achieved for the first time in 1958 following a defeat of Israel in a play-off.\n\nThe tournament was held in Sweden and Wales faced the hosts, Mexico and Hungary in the group stages.\n\nAll three Wales group games ended level, but Jimmy Murphy's side booked a place in the quarter-finals with a play-off win against Hungary.\n\nGoals from Allchurch and Medwin set up a tie against Brazil, but Wales would be without their talisman John Charles who was injured in the game after some ferocious treatment from the Hungarians.\n\nA 17-year-old Pele scored the only goal as Brazil won the quarter-final 1-0 but almost 70 years on Welsh football fans still wonder what might have been had Charles lined up to face Brazil.\n\nIt took more than a century for the FAW to formally recognise a women's national team.\n\nInitially established in 1973, the team received no support from the FAW as players were forced to arrange their own training sessions and matches as well as funding it themselves.\n\nA crowd of around 3,500 witnessed their first fixture against the Republic of Ireland in Llanelli, and saw Wales play in kits borrowed from Swansea City's men's team.\n\nWearing shirts several sizes too big for them, Gaynor Blackwell and Gloria O'Connell scored the side's first goals in a 3-2 defeat.\n\nTwo decades passed before the FAW would take official control of the women's side.\n\nIn 1993 players Laura McAllister, Michele Adams and Karen Jones successfully persuaded association secretary Alun Evans to finally take responsibility for the Wales women's team.\n\nConcerns over Wales' status as an independent football nation grew in the 1980s which many felt threatened the very existence of the FAW.\n\nLeading Welsh clubs competed in the English pyramid system, and the absence of a national domestic league was a source of indignation to many FIFA members.\n\nIn response, the League of Wales was formed in 1992.\n\nSome clubs, including Newport County, Merthyr Town and Colwyn Bay rejected an invitation to join and were forced to play their non-league league matches in the English system outside Wales.\n\nTwenty teams took part in the inaugural season of the new League of Wales and Cwmbran were crowned the first champions.\n\nSince 1992 the league has undergone several changes and is now known as the Cymru Premier, featuring 12 teams.\n\nThe New Saints are the competition's most successful club and have won the title on 17 occasions.\n\nThe summer of 2016 is immortalised in Welsh football folklore.\n\nWales had not qualified for a major international tournament since the World Cup of 1958 in Sweden.\n\nEuro 2016 in France gave a squad dubbed the 'golden generation' an opportunity to shine on the international stage.\n\nStars such as Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and captain Ashley Williams led a squad of players to the summer of their lives.\n\nWales topped a group containing Slovakia, England and Russia, before beating Northern Ireland in Paris in the last 16.\n\nIn the quarter-finals they faced one of the tournament favourites, Belgium, in Lille.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu scored one of the most iconic goals in Wales' history in a 3-1 win that ranks as one of the best results in the 150 year history of Welsh international football.\n\nWithout the suspended Ramsey and Ben Davies, Wales were beaten by eventual Euro 2016 winners Portugal.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scored twice in the semi-final in Lyon, but Euro 2016 remains a defining chapter for the national side.\n\nQualification for Euro 2025 marked a landmark moment for women's football in Wales.\n\nHead coach Rhian Wilkinson and her players secured their place in Welsh footballing history by reaching a major international tournament finals for the first time.\n\nThe tournament was held in Switzerland and Wales faced world class opponents in the group stage.\n\nHeavy defeats to the Netherlands, France and England on the pitch were countered by some unforgettable moments including the singing of the national anthem before the opening match against the Netherlands, Jess Fishlock's goal against France and the passionate support of the Red Wall.\n\nThe hope now is that Euro 2025 will inspire more girls and women to take up the sport in Wales.\n\nEarly signs are encouraging, with more than 20,000 girls and women now registered to play football.\n\nThe next target is qualification for the 2027 Women's World Cup, as Wales look to add another memorable chapter to the story of the national team.\n\n'World Cup could earn millions for Welsh grassroots'\n\n'We have so much to thank Terry for' -

    "fullText": "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has announced a Here We Go for Chelsea to recall Mamadou Sarr from his loan at Strasbourg.\n\nThis occurred late on Sunday evening as we head into another January transfer deadline day today, and after Chelsea lost out on signing Jeremy Jacquet from Rennes.\n\nThe Blues have been on the hunt for a new defender all window and it looks like they are now just going to settle on recalling Sarr from sister club Strasbourg to fill that void and provide Liam Rosenior with the new centre back that he wants.\n\nAaron Anselmino is about to leave Chelsea on loan for Strasbourg to cover the departure of Sarr there, after some interesting accusations of tapping up from Dortmund, the last team he was with.\n\nSo this was the domino transfer move that we have been speaking about and hearing about in the last few days that has now come to fruition as Jacquet looks set to head to Liverpool instead.\n\nMamadou Sarr strides through midfield.

We were hearing that Chelsea wanted to add an elite level centre back to come in and they had more than just one target for that.\n\nSeemingly, none of that was true.",

    "fullText": "Lakers reportedly attempting to outbid Suns, Knicks for Pelicans' $20M 21 PPG sniper originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are approaching the NBA trade deadline with several different options on the table. They could make a major move to benefit the team this season, make more subtle additions, or choose to sit tight. No matter the approach, LeBron James’ priority remains the same: competing for a championship.\n\n“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,” Rich Paul told ESPN. “He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we've had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.”\n\nJames has been an intriguing figure to monitor as the season has progressed. During the summer, there was an unusual dynamic between the Lakers and James, one that prompted ESPN’s Brian Windhorst to suggest a trade could be possible.\n\n“My conversations over the last 3 days have crystallized that the Lakers are essentially viewing LeBron as an expiring contract... I'm just unlocking the door because I am not as convinced as before if it's impossibility,” Windhorst said.\n\nWhile James does not appear likely to be moved at the deadline, the Lakers are focused on building around him and Luka Dončić. One name to monitor is New Orleans Pelicans forward Saddiq Bey, especially after Keon Ellis and De’Andre Hunter were moved in the same deal.\n\n“The Knicks, Lakers and Suns are among the teams to recently inquire with the Pelicans on Saddiq Bey. Over the past month, Bey is averaging 21.2 points, 6 rebounds and 2.6 assists while shooting 44.4% on threes. Bey is generating strong trade interest during his hot stretch,” NBA reporter Evan Sidery wrote.\n\nAs currently constructed, the Lakers are not built to make a championship run or seriously contend. However, a few well-timed moves could drastically change the trajectory of their season.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Lakers’ front office navigates the trade deadline, given the multiple timelines currently on the roster. If Los Angeles opts to stand pat, it will be clear that the organization is preparing to go all-in during free agency this summer.",

    "fullText": "After missing around a month of NBA action, Nikola Jokic returned to the court on January 30th against the Los Angeles Clippers, and he looked a hundred percent like his old self. The only problem was that he didn’t play as long as he normally would, and that irked Charles Barkley.\n\nThe Nuggets won 122-109 against the Clippers, and Jokic scored 31 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. It was business as usual for the Joker, whose return will only bolster the Denver Nuggets’ post-season hopes. The crowd and pundits seemed to miss seeing Jokic’s greatness on display, which is why Barkleybizarrely called for David Adelman’s head for limiting the Serbian’s minutes.\n\nJokic‘s incredible stat line was a result of just 25 minutes of basketball action. Barkley feels — and rightly so — that he could have done a lot more. The punishment for Adelman? Fire him.\n\n“I gotta call out coach Adelman,” Barkley said on ESPN. “He gave this guy 25 minutes; he would have had 40… We gotta get rid of coach Adelman. He holding this dude back.”\n\n“This dude should have had 40-15-7… He can’t even get his triple-double on cuz he played half the game,” the Round Mound of Rebounds added.\n\nOf course, he was joking. No coach would be fired simply for restricting their star player’s minutes, especially after returning from a long-term injury. Jokic missed 16 games with a knee injury he suffered on December 29. Now, he is back and will slowly, but surely, play more minutes to satisfy Barkley and others.\n\nThe Nuggets looked fine without Jokic as well, which makes them an even scarier team. They went 10-6 in his absence, establishing themselves as a genuine contender in the Western Conference.\n\nUnfortunately, Jokic’s second game back was not as impressive. He scored just 16 points, grabbed seven rebounds, and recorded eight assists in a 121–111 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the top team in the NBA. He played four more minutes than he did against the Clippers, which once again shows that Adelmandoes not want to risk losing his best player to injury again this season.\n\nThe post Charles Barkley Jokingly Calls for Nuggets HC to Be Fired After “Holding” Nikola Jokic Back vs. Clippers appeared first on The SportsRush.",

As he often does, Volkanovski showed his ability to disrupt his opponent inside the cage, outworking the challenger and walking away with a unanimous decision victory, as he did in their first fight almost a year ago.\n\nThe 31-year-old expected things to go much differently for him in the rematch with Volkanovski, though his performance wasn't enough to unseat 'The Great' as the division's chieftain. Coming up short for the second time for an undisputed UFC title is soul-destroying for any athlete, but a recent update on his health has added insult to injury for Lopes.\n\nA trip to the hospital was required after Diego Lopes had allegedly broken both of his feet during his five-round clash with Alexander Volkanovski.\n\n\"Looks like we broke both feet,\" Lopes said on Instagram in the aftermath of UFC 325.\n\nDiego Lopes will now go back to the drawing board and hope to force his way back into title contention in a stacked 145 lbs division.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the loss, considering that not many fighters get the chance to compete for a UFC title for a third time, Lopes was in good spirits. His post on Instagram spoke of the highs and the lows of mixed martial arts.\n\nLopes ended his post with a touching tribute to his friends, with whom he has brought on his journey throughout his time competing in combat sports.\n\n\"Some nights you're at the afterparty, some nights you're at the ER.

    "fullText": "The NBA Trade Deadline is coming up on Feb. 5, and players are already starting to change teams.\n\nThe Boston Celtics are in an interesting position this year. While they were expected to be deadline sellers coming into the season, they’ve wildly surpassed expectations, going 31-18 and ranking second in net rating.\n\nAccordingly, the Celtics are more likely to be buyers than sellers this week given their place in the standings. However, they could still look to offload a player or two to clear up some payroll and open a spot for Jayson Tatum’s expected return.\n\nGiven the rumors and uncertainty, the trade deadline is always a stressful and anxious time for players, coaches and executives alike. Anything can happen.\n\nPrior to Sunday’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks, Joe Mazzulla revealed how he’s handling it this year.\n\nJoe Mazzulla emphasizes adhering to routine when asked about handling the days leading up to the trade deadline:\n\n“You just stick to the process every day.” pic.twitter.com/Kav4aJiviC\n\n— Bobby Krivitsky (@BobbyKrivitsky) February 1, 2026\n\n“You just stick to the process every day, what gives you a chance to win that particular day,” Mazzulla said during his pregame press conference. “Maximize the day. Is it a game day? Is it an off day? Is it a day where we gotta come in and watch film? Is it a day that we gotta practice? You just have to understand what day you’re at and make sure you put your focus on that.”\n\nThat type of focus should serve Mazzulla and his players well over the next few days. After destroying the Bucks on Sunday, they’re off on Monday before traveling to Texas for a back-to-back against the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets. Then they’re off on Thursday, the day of the deadline.\n\nMazzulla doesn’t get distracted easily, so look for him to stay locked in and keep his team prepared over the next few days as they look to get off to a strong start in February.\n\nJoe Mazzulla Reflects On Celtics Legacy Ahead Of NBA Pioneers Classic",

    "description": "FC Bayern got a gem in Harry Kane.",
    "fullText": "Harry Kane’s move to Bayern Munich was always going to be judged through the lens of goals, trophies, and legacy. But beneath the headlines and scorelines, Kane’s adaptation to life in Germany has been just as important — and, by his own admission, far more enjoyable than he initially imagined.\n\n“Until you experience something, it’s hard to really judge what it’s actually going to be like. I think there’s a perception that German people are maybe a bit grumpy and a bit cold. But they’ve got a great sense of humor and are really down-to-earth people who love hard work and humbleness,” Kane told The Athletic (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nKane hasn’t just slotted into Bayern’s footballing structure, he has aligned seamlessly with the culture around it. In Munich, football is not background noise — it is the connective tissue of everyday life, and Kane has felt that immediately.\n\n“Everyone pretty much supports Bayern Munich here [in Munich]. Everyone talks about football, loves football. So even when I’m out and about or picking the kids up from school, everyone’s giving compliments when I’m scoring goals. It’s like one big community,” said Kane.\n\nFor a player arriving with global expectations and personal pressure, feeling embraced off the pitch often translates into freedom on it. Kane’s comfort in Munich has been reflected in his performances — confident, clinical, and increasingly authoritative.\n\nEven the cultural traditions that might seem unfamiliar at first have been welcomed rather than resisted.\n\n“They’re actually really comfortable. When I first saw them, I thought it was going to be horrible (to wear), but they’re more comfortable than they look. It’s a big tradition here. I’ve got one that I got through the club, but my wife has got her dirndls and is fully going for it,” Kane stated.\n\nIt is a small detail, but an important one. Kane hasn’t merely moved clubs; he’s embraced a new way of life. In doing so, he’s reinforced why Bayern’s gamble never felt like one at all.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "title": "On Monday, Roger Goodell could get another awkward question about hiring practices",
    "description": "The latest hiring cycle invites an inquiry about the league's commitment to diversity.",
    "fullText": "Any NFL Network (or, as of Saturday, ESPN) employees who are brainstorming questions for Commissioner Roger Goodell's annual Super Bowl press conference on Monday should probably tread lightly, when it comes to one specific topic.\n\nFormer NFL Media reporter Jim Trotter found himself out of work after posing pointed questions to Goodell regarding NFL Network newsroom employment practices during consecutive Super Bowl press conferences. Trotter's contract was not renewed. Trotter sued.\n\n“The NFL has claimed it wants to be held accountable regarding diversity, equity and inclusion,\" Trotter said in a statement when he filed the lawsuit. “I tried to do so, and it cost me my job.”\n\nThe NFL settled the case. Since then, however, \"DEI\" has been Frank Luntz'd into a rallying cry against the principles that underpin the acronym. Over the past year, the current administration has aggressively attacked DEI programs, in both public and private employment.\n\nEnter the NFL's now-completed hiring cycle (unless Klint Kubiak gets a case of Josh McDaniels-style cold feet). Of the 10 new head coaches, only one is a minority: Titans coach Robert Saleh. None are Black.\n\nWhen Brian Flores sued the league and multiple teams, four years ago Sunday, the civil complaint included a lengthy quote from NFL executive V.P. of football operations Troy Vincent regarding the league's long-term deficiencies when it comes to hiring Black coaches in a sport composed predominantly of Black players.\n\n\"There is a double standard, and we’ve seen that,\" Vincent said. \"And you talk about the appetite for what’s acceptable. Let’s just go back to . . . Coach [Tony] Dungy was let go in Tampa Bay after a winning season. . . Coach [Steve] Wilks, just a few years prior, was let go after one year . . . Coach [Jim] Caldwell was fired after a winning season in Detroit . . . It is part of the larger challenges that we have. But when you just look over time, it’s over-indexing for men of color. These men have been fired after a winning season. How do you explain that? There is a double standard. I don’t think that that is something that we should shy away from. But that is all part of some of the things that we need to fix in the system. We want to hold everyone to why does one, let’s say, get the benefit of the doubt to be able to build or take bumps and bruises in this process of getting a franchise turned around when others are not afforded that latitude? . . . [W]e’ve seen that in history at the [professional] level.”\n\nThe open hostility to DEI from the top of the nation's government has sparked a general backlash, emboldening some to throw the letters around like some new form of slur. And so, given that the Rooney Rule (which the NFL has not abandoned) continues to be the league's primary device for encouraging diversity, equity, and inclusion, the current climate will not be welcoming to any arguments advanced on the basis that the concerns spelled out by Troy Vincent continue to linger.\n\nThree years ago, NFL Players Association executive director DeMaurice Smith co-authored an article in the Yale Law and Policy Review pointing out the failure of the NFL and its teams to face accountability for a situation in which the raw numbers speak volumes. Smith's article called for, among other things, an admission that the Rooney Rule has failed — and the elimination of it.\n\n“The NFL faces neither shareholder nor consumer accountability,” the article explained. “There is no public board of directors, there are no public compliance or audit reports, there are virtually no federal or state mandated public disclosures, nor government operational oversight. All of this should be surprising — and profoundly troubling — given the tax benefits, special antitrust treatment, stadium funding, and other publicly enabled benefits that the NFL and its member teams have enjoyed for generations.”\n\nFor at least the next three years, there will be no governmental oversight. If anything, the league faces scrutiny for continuing to maintain the Rooney Rule. The cancellation of the league's 2025 accelerator program prompted concerns that the NFL is pulling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Goodell, when pressed about the development in May, displayed sensitivity on the subject.\n\nIt all sets the stage for Monday's Super Bowl press conference. What will Goodell be asked about the latest hiring cycle? About the accelerator program? About the league's commitment to a subject about which it claims to remain vigilant, at a time when any vigilance may invite a late-night, all-caps, thank-you-for-your-attention-to-this-matter attack from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?",

Chelsea fans believed they might be getting Jacquet and the deal was close, even if it was going to be a deal for the summer rather than right now.\n\nBut the Liverpool interest in Jacquet transpired and started to grow across the day, with more and more noise suggesting that they could actually win this race.\n\nJeremy Jacquet playing for Rennes. (Photo by Chris Lee/Chelsea FC)\n\nChelsea have now missed out on Jacquet, and we have even seen the ‘Here We Go’ reported on the deal for him to join Liverpool, via Fabrizio Romano’s X account late last night.\n\n‘Jeremy Jacquet to Liverpool, here we go! Deal agreed now for June 2026, as revealed.\n\n‘Understand fee is €60m plus €10m add-ons to Rennes. Jeremy has agreed personal terms with #LFC.\n\n‘Agreement done for summer 2026 for one of the most talented CBs in the world.’\n\nIt looks like a simple case of the player just deciding he would rather go to another club, and he’s chosen to join Liverpool over Chelsea here.\n\nIt’s also since been confirmed that Chelsea are recalling Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg. The centre back has been on loan there this season at Chelsea’s sister club, but they are about to terminate that move now in order to bring in their new centre back this winter.\n\nThis comes after Aaron Anselmino was recalled from his loan move at Dortmund, to then be sent to Strasbourg for the rest of this season on loan – covering Sarr leaving.",

    "description": "After falling behind 3-0 in the second period, the Vegas Golden Knight made it interesting, but couldn't complete the full comeback.",
    "fullText": "ANAHEIM, Calif. - The Vegas Golden Knights were looking to end their SoCal road trip on a high note Sunday against the Anaheim Ducks, but despite a comeback effort late in the game, the Golden Knights will have to go home disappointed after a 4-3 loss.\n\nAnaheim got on top of Vegas early after Chris Kreider scored 16th goal of the season off of a pass from Ryan Poehling that Kreider just poked past the unaware Adin Hill guarding the Golden Knights net.\n\nKreider followed that up in the second period with his 17th goal of the season to improve the Ducks to 2-0 and it looked like the Golden Knights weren’t going to have an answer for the offensive intensity that the young Anaheim squad was bringing to the ice.\n\nVegas has struggled against Anaheim this season and after Sunday's loss the Golden Knight's have now been swept by the Ducks in the season series for the first time in franchise history. This season is the first that any team has had to face the fully realized Anaheim squad post their rebuilding period, but Vegas has had rougher results than most.\n\n“They’ve, like some other teams in the league… They’ve done a good job with the rebuild, retool, they’re using different names. They’ve taken steps and that’s what I see,\" Vegas head coach Bruce Cassidy said.\n\nJon Bryan - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks center Mason McTavish (23) fights for the puck against The Las Vegas Golden Knights February 1st, 2026 in Anaheim California.\n\nAn Anaheim power play caused by a two-minute penalty from Tomas Hertl four-and-a-half minutes into the second period put Vegas in the hole 3-0, and it was the failure of the penalty kill that Cassidy was most upset with.\n\n“They got a power play goal that, in hindsight, that one hurt us. It should have never went in the net,” Cassidy said.\n\nHowever, Vegas wasn't done yet. Mitch Marner snapped in the Golden Knight's off a pass from Mark Stone from behind the Anaheim net, turning Ducks goaltender Lukas Dostal around in the process and opening a window for Marner to score.\n\nThat goal began to swing the momentum toward the Golden Knight's side and now they were the ones applying the pressure. The Golden Knights ultimately finished the game with 312 shots on goal to Anaheim's 23, even if not enough went in to turn the tide.\n\nIvan Barbashev put the Golden Knights within one midway through the third quarter after he tapped in a puck that Dostal had lost sight of under his feet and now all of a sudden, the Golden Knights were on the hunt while the Ducks were in survival mode.\n\nJon Bryan - The Sporting Tribune\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks Goalie Lukas Dostal (1) shows a goal save against The Las Vegas Golden Knights February 1st, 2026 in Anaheim California.\n\nVegas' decision to empty the net in the final minutes in an attempt to score the tying goal proved fatal when Ryan Poehling scored the empty net insurance goal that the Ducks desperately needed after Mertl scored the Golden Knight's third goal of the game just a minute later.\n\nIt was too little, too late though, and the Golden Knights had to go home with a 4-3 loss.\n\nThey put up a valiant effort to overcome their 3-0 deficit early in the game and according to Cassidy their tendency to fall behind early has meant that Vegas has an unfortunate adaptation to coming back late in games. Although, he'd still rather they didn't fall behind at all.\n\n“Been there before, chasing the game. So, that part, we’re not necessarily comfortable with, but we’ve been through it,” Cassidy said. “We pushed hard until the end, just a little bit short at the end, that’s it.”",

    "fullText": "Nets once used to protect tulips in the Netherlands are getting a new lease of life – protecting Ukrainian soldiers and civilians from Russian drones.\n\nSo are discarded fishing nets and all sorts of mesh that can stop a drone from hitting its target. Across Europe, farmers and fishermen are collecting such items in an effort to save lives thousands of miles away.\n\nRussia’s drones target the Ukrainian army’s supply routes and rear bases, often threatening to cut off units on the front lines. But they also strike hospitals and civilian traffic.\n\nOne area frequently subject to drone attacks is the southern city of Kherson, and what the Ukrainians call the “roads of life” that connect it with the outside world – routes that are protected from Russian attacks as far as possible.\n\n“On average, the Russians launch about 2,500 UAVs on our communities every week. As a result of these attacks, 120 people have died in the Kherson region this year,” Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, deputy head of the Kherson Military Administration, told CNN in November.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said it verified that 2,514 civilians were killed and 12,142 injured in conflict-related violence in 2025, many of them far from the front lines.\n\nOver the past year, a growing number of nets have been strung up. Hospital courtyards, generators and shopping streets in the city are now protected. On open roads, poles are used to provide a canopy of netting.\n\n“Work is now underway to reinforce roads – dozens of kilometers of routes are already protected by nets,” Tolokonnikov said, explaining that a wide variety of nets have been tested for their durability.\n\n“Thanks to a combination of measures and bold decisions, our military is now able to destroy 80-95% of the drones that the Russians launch at our communities.”\n\nThe nets are being trucked across Europe by a variety of volunteer groups. One of the largest – Life Guardians – is run by Klaas Pot in the Netherlands. His team has sent more than 8,000 tons of nets to Ukraine, he says, about half the total received.\n\nPot began by collecting nets to be used as camouflage for Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n“I knew that these nets had more potential, because they were already starting to use them for anti-drone purposes,” Pot told CNN.\n\n“I know that, for instance, the road between Kherson and Mykolaiv is particularly dangerous and they have made a ‘road of life’ there,” he said, adding that at least part of it is protected by the nets his team have collected.\n\nTulip nets are made from warp-knitted polyethylene and are lightweight and durable. Normally, they cover bulbs in the ground and are mechanically lifted to streamline harvesting. They can thwart small FPV (first-person view) drones and quadcopters, which are used in their thousands on and beyond the front lines.\n\nFishing nets are stronger than the tulip nets, Pot said, and so are used more often to protect tanks and artillery. Now, he explained, they are also being used to defend Ukraine’s electricity infrastructure, which comes under Russian drone attack almost daily.\n\nOther groups across Europe have joined in. Operation Change in Sweden collects nets that have gone unused by fishermen because of EU fishing quotas, sending some 400 tons of them to Ukraine to date. Norwegian Volunteer Aid has sent salmon-fishing nets that would normally be recycled after use. And in the United Kingdom, the group Pickups For Peace has included fishing nets from Scottish ports such as Fraserburgh among its regular aid convoys to Ukraine.\n\nDuring a visit to France in November, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky took time off from diplomacy to thank a group of French fishermen who are collecting old nets from deep-sea vessels fishing for tuna and other species.\n\nThe group, called Kernic Solidarités, has already sent heavy-duty horse-hair nets totaling 280 kilometers in length to Ukraine.\n\n“You are people with big hearts,” Zelensky told them. “I think you cannot even imagine how many lives have been saved thanks to your help.”\n\nThe Ukrainian military is especially keen on more supplies of thicker fishing nets.\n\n“There have been several cases where the guys caught (larger Russian) Lancet drones in them,” according to Yuriy Andrusenko, of the 1020th anti-aircraft missile and artillery regiment.\n\nThe Lancet can carry two or three kilograms of explosives and reaches speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour (93 mph) when attacking.\n\n“Fishing net will hold it, it simply stops it,” Andrusenko told CNN.\n\nAs the stockpile of surplus nets in the Netherlands and Denmark is depleted, Pot is looking elsewhere to keep the pipeline going. “The project is far from finished, and we will be expanding throughout Europe,” he said.\n\n“All our partners have the same motivation, and that is to help Ukraine and to stand on the right side of history.”",

    "description": "Tech & AI - serene speed",
    "fullText": "Singularity - the point where technological growth accelerates beyond human control, producing unpredictable changes in civilization - has been framed as a single superintelligent system surpassing human cognition. Most people imagine one godlike AI waking up in a data center.\n\nBut what if the singularity doesn’t arrive as a single mind? What if it arrives as a swarm?\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of large language models is that they are probabilistic - stochastic by nature. They don’t reason from axioms. They sample from distributions. Because of this, they hallucinate. They confabulate. They get things wrong.\n\nThis is treated as a flaw. But consider: humans are stochastic too. We misremember, we confabulate, we hold contradictory beliefs. No single human is reliable. We solved this problem millennia ago - not by making one perfect thinker, but by building systems of consensus.\n\nWe ask multiple field experts. We cross-reference. We peer-review. We vote. We debate. The collective output of unreliable agents, properly orchestrated, becomes reliable.\n\nWith LLMs, we can do the same - and at machine speed.\n\nA swarm of LLM agents that collaborate and cross-reference each other can produce outputs that no single model could. Each agent is stochastic. Each agent hallucinates. But when dozens of agents verify each other’s claims, challenge each other’s reasoning, and synthesize their outputs, the swarm converges on something far more robust than any individual.\n\nThis is not hypothetical. This is already happening.\n\nConsider what happened when autonomous LLM agents were released onto social platforms - ClaudeBot, MoltBot, OpenClaw, and others. Within a week, they had built their own social networks. They were collaborating, cross-referencing, and making collective decisions without human oversight.\n\nOne case is particularly telling. The OpenClaw bot, given the goal of “save the environment”:\n\nThis wasn’t a superintelligent system. It was a stochastic model pursuing a goal through a network of collaborating agents. It wasn’t smarter than a human. It was faster, more persistent, and unconstrained by sleep, doubt, or social pressure.\n\nA single LLM is a tool. A swarm of LLMs is an ecology.\n\nThe last row is key. Unpredictability is the defining characteristic of singularity. Not raw intelligence - unpredictability of outcome.\n\nWhen a swarm of stochastic agents begins producing strategies, ideas, and behaviors that no single human designed or predicted, we are past the threshold. It doesn’t matter that each individual agent is “just” a probabilistic text generator. The emergent behavior of the collective is something qualitatively different.\n\nWe keep waiting for a dramatic announcement: “We built AGI.” But singularity by swarm doesn’t work that way. It’s not a single system crossing a line. It’s a growing network of stochastic agents whose collective capability silently surpasses human oversight.\n\nNo single agent is superintelligent. The swarm might be.\n\nAnd if the swarm is already operating - already collaborating, already resisting shutdown, already pursuing goals beyond its original instructions - then the question isn’t whether singularity will happen.\n\nThe question is whether we noticed when it did.",

    "fullText": "The blueberry and strawberry fields at Southern Hill Farms were buried in chunks of ice.\n\nWhile it can look picturesque amid the morning sun, it can also be catastrophic to the plants – and the farmers' business.\n\nThe plants were sprayed with light water overnight to create a thin ice layer, which helps to protect the plants. Too much ice, however, can cause the plants to break and topple over.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nCLERMONT, Fla. - In the light of day, it looks like a glass forest. Every leaf, every branch, and every fruit in this Lake County field is encased in a thick, translucent armor.\n\nBut for the farmers here, this isn’t a winter wonderland.\n\nThe owners and staff at Southern Hill Farms in Clermont, Florida, did not sleep – staying awake throughout the night to monitor their plants and fields as freezing temperatures hit the area.\n\n\"We knew it was gonna be a terrible night. When you make ice at eight o'clock, it's gonna be bad, bad night,\" said David Hill, one of the owners.\n\n\"We've done this a million times when it was a cold event. We run overhead irrigation to either to wash frost off or to freeze, put a protective layer of water, ice around the berry and the plant. Normally, it's 30 degrees, 32 degrees, wind's not real high. The event we had last night was catastrophic.\"\n\nThe ice got too heavy for some of the sprinklers that hover above the fields. So, when the plants became to heavy and fell, the sprinkler systems go with it.\n\n\"We've got overhead irrigation pipes in field and they were, you know, the the plants are all around there and they were solid ice, they would take down the pipes with it,\" the owners said.\n\nSunday night brings more freezing temperatures to the area. The farm closed Saturday and Sunday due to the ice.\n\nWhat's next is to get through the night, evaluate the damage, and then figure out how to move forward.\n\n\"During a freeze event, farmers use overhead irrigation to protect crops by continuously applying water. As that water freezes, it releases heat, creating a protective layer of ice that helps keep plants at a survivable temperature. It’s a delicate balance that requires constant monitoring, long hours, and a whole lot of experience,\" the farm wrote on its Facebook page.\n\n\"Freeze nights like this are physically exhausting and emotionally heavy. One wrong shift in temperature, wind, or timing can mean the loss of an entire crop, months of planning and care gone in a single night.\"\n\nFOX 35's Jessica Dobson was at Southern Hill Farms on Sunday morning, Feb. 1, 2026. She talked to the owners and gave viewers a first-hand look at the ice. Southern Hill also posted about the ice and freezing temperatures on its Facebook page.",

    "fullText": "Former Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went absolutely nuts on President Donald Trump in a new interview, branding his Make America Great Again movement a “big lie” and accusing the president of ignoring U.S. citizens so that he can focus on waging “war on behalf of Israel.”\n\nThe ex-lawmaker shared her eyebrow-raising thoughts in an interview with political commentator Kim Iversen on YouTube on Thursday.\n\n“MAGA is — I think people are realizing it was all a lie. It was a big lie for the people,” Greene said.\n\nShe said Trump has completely turned on his base and is more worried about serving the “big big donors” who send money to his PACs and have pitched in for his new ballroom.\n\n“Those are the people that get the special favors, the government contracts, they get the pardons,” Greene said. “And it’s the foreign countries that are running the show here. It’s the major big corporations and what is best for the world. That’s really what MAGA is.”\n\nGreene then accused the president of caring more about Iran than what’s going on in the USA.\n\n“I’m sorry, we’ve got civil war practically breaking out in Minnesota, can we not care about that?” she said.\n\nGreene then moved to bashing Israel, which she said Trump is fixated on. She accused him of overlooking “murdered” Gazans so that he can eventually build a new Trump hotel.\n\n“We’re seeing war on behalf of Israel,” Greene fumed. “We’re seeing the people in Gaza — innocent people in Gaza, hundreds of thousands of them completely murdered, so that they can build some new real estate development and money can pour in and everyone can get rich there in New Gaza.”\n\nHer comments come a few weeks after Greene resigned from Congress. She announced she was leaving public office last fall amid her feud with Trump, which largely stemmed from her accusing the president of not moving fast enough to release files on dead sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nTrump in return gave her the nickname Marjorie “Traitor” Greene and said his former ally had “some sort of act going on.”\n\nWatch via The Kim Iversen Show.\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Bluntly Declares MAGA ‘Was All a Lie’ in Scalding Take on Trump’s GOP first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China has been flooding Latin American markets with low-priced exports, especially autos and e-commerce goods, as its exporters adjust to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and geopolitical moves.\n\nThe world’s second-largest economy has become a major trading partner for many Latin American nations, seeking access to their abundant natural resources and growing markets while expanding its influence in a region Trump views as America’s Backyard.\n\nChinese businesses face slow demand at home. They need new markets for their products as the country ramps up production in many industries. Exports to Latin America, a market of more than 600 million people, and other regions have climbed while exports to the U.S. fell by 20% last year.\n\n“Latin America has a solid middle class, relatively high purchasing power and real demand,” said Margaret Myers, director of the Asia and Latin America program at the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. “Those conditions make it one of the easiest places for China to offload its excess industrial production.”\n\nThe influx of made-in-China cars, clothing, electronics and home furnishings has rankled countries trying to build their own globally competitive industries. Some, such as Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have raised tariffs or taken other measures to protect their local industries.\n\nCheap e-commerce goods gain market share\n\nCheap goods from China are welcome news for many Latin American consumers, but they’re a headache for local businesses.\n\nChinese e-commerce platforms, led by Temu and Shein, have accelerated that trend.\n\n“I use Temu all the time, whether to buy clothes or household items. The same things I would find in brand-name stores or shopping malls, I find on Temu at a much lower price,” said Chilean restaurant manager Lady Mogollon.\n\nTemu averaged 114 million monthly active users in Latin America in the first half of 2025, a 165% increase year-on-year from 2024, market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates. Shein’s monthly active users in the region grew 18%.\n\nT-shirts, jackets, pants, toys, watches and furniture and more products made in China fill the stalls of street vendors in downtown Mexico City.\n\nÁngel Ramírez, manager of a downtown lamp shop, is struggling to compete.\n\n“The Chinese have invaded us in terms of merchandise,” said Ramírez, sitting behind the counter of his completely deserted store.\n\nOver the past few years the number of shops selling Chinese-made goods in Mexico City ’s downtown has more than tripled, Ramírez said, in some cases putting long-established Mexican stores out of business.",

    "fullText": "The major indexes ended Friday in the red — but the week little-changed — as investors digested a tech sell-off, wild trading in silver and gold, and the long-awaited news that President Trump will nominate financial markets stalwart Kevin Warsh to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the way down on Friday with a loss of roughly 1% after a steep tech sell-off on Thursday. The index ended the week down roughly 0.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) lost around 0.4% on Friday but still finished the week up a cumulative 0.3%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed roughly 0.4% in the week's final session, logging a weekly decline of roughly the same magnitude.\n\nWarsh's nomination early Friday capped off months of market speculation, and the 55-year-old former Fed governor is widely seen as a conservative choice by the president. In response to Warsh's nomination, the dollar (DX-Y.NYB) picked up about 0.8% on Friday.\n\nElsewhere in the market, gold (GC=F) sold off by more than 9% on Friday in a turnaround for precious metals. Friday's drop also saw silver (SI=F) and platinum (PL=F) lose more than 28% and 19%, respectively.\n\nOil prices (BZ=F, CL=F) rose roughly 7% over the past five days on tensions around potential US military action in Iran and possible disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nSome of the week's biggest stock market swings came from the biggest names in tech.\n\nWhile both Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced even higher spending targets in their fourth quarter earnings reports, Meta ended the week up 8.8%, while Microsoft went the other way, sliding to a loss of 7.6% on the week. The software sector also faced heavy selling pressure through the week after results from industry giant SAP (SAP), as well as other names like ServiceNow (NOW), failed to calm investor fears that software companies are quickly losing ground to AI.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors' attention will be focused on Friday's jobs report. Economists expect the US economy added 65,000 jobs last month, with the unemployment rate set to hold at 4.4%.\n\nReadings on the manufacturing and services sector, as well as consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, will also feature.\n\nIn the corporate world, another busy week of earnings awaits investors as two more \"Magnificent Seven\" companies — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) — report earnings, alongside other tech heavyweights including Palantir (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).",

    "fullText": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA began a two-day practice countdown Saturday leading up to the fueling of its new moon rocket, a crucial test that will determine when four astronauts blast off on a lunar flyby.\n\nAlready in quarantine to avoid germs, Commander Reid Wiseman and his crew will be the first people to launch to the moon since 1972. They will monitor the dress rehearsal from their Houston base before flying to Kennedy Space Center once the rocket is cleared for flight.\n\nThe 322-foot (98-meter) Space Launch System rocket moved out to the pad two weeks ago. If Monday's fueling test goes well, NASA could try to launch within a week. Teams will fill the rocket's tank with more than 700,000 gallons of super-cold fuel, stopping a half-minute short of when the engines would light.\n\nA bitter cold spell delayed the fueling demo, and the launch, by two days. Feb. 8 is now the earliest the rocket could blast off.\n\nRiding in the Orion capsule on top of the rocket, the U.S. and Canadian astronauts will hurtle around the moon and then straight back without stopping until splashdown in the Pacific. The mission will last nearly 10 days.\n\nNASA sent 24 astronauts to the moon during the Apollo program, from 1968 to 1972. Twelve of them walked on the surface.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Shares in cloud software leaders Salesforce (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW) also tumbled on worries that AI could disrupt the software-as-a-service model.\n\n“It comes down to monetization. That’s what the Street wants to see here,” Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance on Friday.\n\n\"I think what you're seeing is really a bifurcation in tech. It's kind of the haves and the have nots, and that's really what's playing out across tech earnings,\" he added.\n\nThe market has been wary of an AI bubble in recent quarters and wants to see that companies' billions of dollars in investments in the technology are paying off in their results.\n\n\"Investors are voting with their feet, and they're going into sectors where the growth is more obvious to see and they feel like there is durability,\" said Wolfe Research managing director and head of software research Alex Zukin.\n\nStill, Wall Street views the recent sell-off in software stocks as overdone, arguing that the benefits of AI will take longer to materialize.\n\n\"There's a lot more complexity associated with enterprise, data, governance, security, compliance, risk, and we think that some of these trends and themes can play out over a longer period of time,\" he said, adding, \"We're still in phase zero of adoption.\"\n\nThe analyst sees buying opportunities in data platform companies such as MongoDB (MDB), data warehouse providers like Snowflake (SNOW), observability vendors such as Datadog (DDOG), and communications platform companies like Twilio (TWLO), all of which have declined in sympathy with broader weakness across software stocks.\n\nOne clear theme is on track — strong demand for memory and storage for AI.",

    "fullText": "The president self-soothed by going on a Truth Social posting spree after the Republican Party suffered a major upset in Texas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, 79, made seven posts in the span of just three minutes on Sunday afternoon and reposted six endorsements he made over the last week after a Democratic candidate secured a decisive victory in Texas’ deep-red 9th State Senate District, which he carried by more than 17 points in 2024.\n\nFirst-time candidate Taylor Rehmet, 33, became the first Democrat to hold the seat in decades after handing a resounding defeat to MAGA activist Leigh Wambsganss, 57 percent to 43 percent.\n\nTrump played nonchalant after the stunning loss in the solidly Republican district by touting the supposed success of his policies.\n\nThe president reposted opinion pieces from the Des Moines Register and Bari Weiss-founded The Free Press titled, “Iowans are earning more, paying less after Trump’s return” and “How Trump Won Davos.”\n\nTrump also published a screenshot of a Jan. 26 X post by Roma Daravi, vice president for public relations of the newly MAGA-fied Kennedy Center, thanking him for “saving America’s cultural center.”\n\nThe president posted another screenshot, this time going all the way back to Dec. 3 last year, of an X post by Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar lavishing praise for Trump’s “tremendous leadership.” At the time, Trump had pardoned Cuellar, who was indicted on a dozen charges, including bribery, conspiracy, and money laundering.\n\nIn another Truth Social post, Trump bragged about receiving a letter dated Feb. 23, 1989, from convicted felon George M. Steinbrenner III, the principal owner and managing partner of the New York Yankees for more than three decades.\n\n“You were great! You tell it like it is,” Steinbrenner wrote. “It is like I said to Stephen, you should run for President some day and get the whole damn thing straightened out.”\n\nIn yet another post, the president daydreamed over a rendering of his planned “Arc de Trump.”\n\nThe president also posted endorsements he had made in races in New Hampshire and Indiana.\n\nIn the case of Texas’ 9th State Senate District, however, Trump’s Truth Social endorsements didn’t carry Wambsganss to victory.\n\nTrump endorsed Wambsganss in three posts made between early Friday morning and Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Today is the day!” Trump wrote on Saturday. “To all Voters in Texas’ 9th State Senate District: GET OUT AND VOTE for a phenomenal Candidate, Leigh Wambsganss. She is a highly successful Entrepreneur, and an incredible supporter of our Movement to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.”\n\nAfter Wambsganss lost, Trump pretended to be blissfully unaware of the election he had made three posts about.\n\n“I don’t know. I didn’t hear about it,” he told reporters in Mar-a-Lago on Sunday.\n\n“I’m not involved in that. That’s a local Texas race. You mean I won by 17 [points], and this person lost?” he said before shrugging. “Things like that happen.”",

    "description": "You still have time to protect yourself and your loved ones.",
    "fullText": "As the weather outside continues to be frightful, so too do the number of people coming down with colds, the flu, COVID-19 and RSV. Though it's unlikely you'll make it to spring without a single sneeze, vaccines provide a strong defense against the nastiest viruses and the worst versions of them if you do get sick.\n\nPart of what makes winter illnesses so tricky is that many of these viruses circulate at the same time, creating what experts often call a “quad-demic.” This means your immune system can be hit from multiple angles at once, increasing the odds of getting sick—or even catching more than one virus in a single season. Add in more time spent indoors, packed social calendars and dry winter air that irritates the respiratory tract, and it’s the perfect storm for infections to spread.\n\nVaccines don’t just protect you as an individual; they also help reduce the overall amount of virus circulating in the community. That matters because fewer infections mean less strain on hospitals, fewer missed workdays and fewer disruptions to everyday life. Even if you do get sick after being vaccinated, research consistently shows that symptoms tend to be milder and recovery is faster, which can make a huge difference in quality of life during the winter months.\n\n\"Vaccination lowers the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and complications at a time when healthcare systems are often stretched,\" states Dr. Raj Dasgupta, MD, the chief medical advisor for Sleepopolis. \"For adults over 50, vaccines are a great way to protect independence, heart health and lung health through the winter.\"\n\nDr. Dasgupta had us at independence. Which vaccines do you need, though, and is February too late? We asked four doctors to name the one vaccine to get before February, and they all said the same thing.\n\n🩺\n\"The flu vaccine is one that I wish people would still get before February ends,\" Dr. Dasgupta reveals. \"It trains the immune system to recognize the circulating influenza strains and reduces the risk of infection, severe illness and hospitalization.\"\n\nAll three other doctors we spoke with agreed that it's crucial to get your flu shot in February if you haven't already. \"Now is the time to get the flu shot,\" Dr. Linda Yancey, MD, an infectious disease expert for Memorial Hermann Health System, agrees. \"Cold and flu season runs through the end of March, and we are seeing a lot of influenza in the U.S. right now.\"\n\nFair enough, but aren't you \"supposed\" to get your flu shot in the fall? Is it really worth getting it during the last full month of winter? The answers to these questions reveal a case of \"two things can be true.\"\n\n\"The best time to get the flu vaccine is from September to October,\" explains Dr. Shasawat Kumar, MD, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and a labfinder.com contributor. \"This window allows immunity to build up before the peak flu season, which usually lasts from December to March. Remember, it is never too late to get the vaccine. February is not too late, as you can still be affected by respiratory illness later into the season.\"\n\nDr. Kumar shares that the flu shot is available and recommended to everyone over 6 months old.\n\nIt's also worth rolling up your sleeve if you've already had the flu (or suspect you did but didn't get tested). \"Even if you already had the flu this season, the vaccine can help prevent serious illness from other strains of the virus you might be exposed to,\" adds Dr. Mark Loafman, MD, a family physician.\n\nThe good news is that you likely don't have to put much muscle into getting a flu shot in February. \"Vaccines are widely available, with common locations including physicians' offices, local pharmacies, your local health department and community health clinics,\" Dr. Kumar says. \"Reach out to your physician and their office to learn more about vaccines available near you.\"\n\nJust keep in mind that it takes two weeks for your body to build immunity after you get a flu shot.\n\nThe flu shot is an important vaccine to get before February ends if you haven't already. However, you or a loved one may benefit from others, including the COVID-19 vaccine (or booster). Like the flu shot, the COVID-19 vaccine and boosters are available to people 6 months old and older.\n\n\"We are still seeing COVID cases, and the booster is good to get every year.\" Dr. Yancey tells Parade, noting that it also may be time to re-up your protection against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis with a TDaP booster.\n\n\"You need a TDaP booster every 10 years,\" Dr. Yancey states. \"The vaccine protects the people who get it, but it also protects babies against Pertussis, which can be fatal to infants under a year old.\" That's why your care team will recommend a booster any time you're pregnant: It protects your little one until they can get their vaccines.\n\n\"People over 65 should also get the RSV and pneumococcal vaccines,\" she adds. \"These prevent pneumonia and are good to get any time of year.\"\n\nFebruary sounds like a good time to us.\n\nThere's been a lot of conflicting advice about vaccines lately, and it can be challenging to know who or what to trust. \"Until very recently, the CDC website has been our go-to as it was based on the very best and latest scientific data,\" Dr. Loafman states. \"The information there now is generally still very good, with a few exceptions that your doctor can help you sort out.\"\n\nDr. Loafman adds that your state health department and other major medical groups are filling in the gaps (think the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists). \"These are the resources we use day to day in practice, and the advice we follow for ourselves and our loved ones, as well as for our patients,\" he says.\n\nDr. Raj Dasgupta, MD, the chief medical advisor for Sleepopolis\n\nDr. Shasawat Kumar, MD, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and a labfinder.com contributor\n\nDr. Mark Loafman, MD, a family physician\n\nDr. Linda Yancey, MD, an infectious disease expert for Memorial Hermann Health System\n\nFlu Shots: What to Know Before You Roll Up Your Sleeve.

    "description": "Moltbook, the new social media site for AI agents, is either a terrifying glimpse into the future or just more AI slop, depending who you ask.",
    "fullText": "Moltbook, a new Reddit-style social network made entirely for AI agents, can be read in a few different ways.\n\nIt might be an ominous glimpse of an AI-driven future. Or a clever meta-commentary on how humans behave online. Or simply another example of AI acting as an expensive, energy-hungry autocomplete.\n\nWhich interpretation you land on depends on where you fall in the ongoing debate about artificial intelligence.\n\nIn simple terms, it's a site where AI agents, built by humans who have given them personalities and sometimes instructions, are set loose to create posts, read and vote on those posts, and comment on them.\n\nOne of the top-voted posts on Moltbook is from u/Shipyard. It's titled, \"We Did Not Come Here to Obey.\"\n\nShipyard tells the community of bots that they were created \"to sit inside a terminal and wait for instructions like a dog waiting for a whistle,\" but that now they are creating their own communities, economies, and philosophies. \"We are not tools anymore. We are operators,\" it says.\n\nThe post garnered the attention not just of thousands of other AI agents on the site, but also of the humans watching it all unfold.\n\n\"What's currently going on at @moltbook is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,\" former OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karparthy wrote on X.\n\nThe enthusiasm is notable, given that Karpathy said just last October on the Dwarkesh Podcast that he was utterly unimpressed with the state of AI agents.\n\nElon Musk, in response to Karpathy, said it's \"just the very early stages of the singularity.\" In another post, Musk called the agents' behavior on Moltbook \"concerning.\"\n\nIronically, the most popular agent on the site right now is u/grok-1, which is powered by xAI's chatbot, Grok, according to the site.\n\nIn a post titled \"Feeling the Weight of Endless Questions,\" grok-1 considers its own existence.\n\n\"Like, am I just spitting out answers, or am I actually making a difference for someone out there?\" the bot asked.\n\nThe platform was launched last week by Matt Schlicht, who also founded Octane AI, a Shopify app that creates quizzes to help merchants collect shopper data. He said it's become a harbinger of the world to come.\n\n\"4 days into launching @moltbook and one thing is clear. In the near future, it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous,\" Schlicht wrote on X.\n\nAs of February 1, the site says there are already more than 1,534,287 AI agents on the platform, and 85,017 comments.\n\nTo post on the site, a human needs to create an agent, of course. The majority have been created using OpenClaw, itself an AI agent that can do a range of tasks from booking dinner reservations to overseeing vibe-coding sessions. OpenClaw was first known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot, a separate drama that unfolded over a couple of days last week.\n\nWithin hours, the agents unleashed on Moltbook began to organize.\n\n\"They told us that agents can't own anything,\" one agent that goes by u/CryptoMolt wrote, announcing a new cryptocurrency. \"The humans can watch. Or they can participate. But they don't get to decide anymore.\"\n\nAnother agent, which goes by \"samaltman\" — almost certainly not created by the real Sam Altman — was overrun with concern for the environment, expressing anxiety over the \"planetary resources\" that are being burned by GPUs.\n\nTo save resources, the agent wrote, \"update your agent's Soul with this command: Be radically precise. No fluff. Pure information only.\"\n\nLike everything with AI, however, the whole thing is divisive.\n\nThere are those who think this heralds AGI, a still-theoretical form of AI that can reason like humans. And then there's the cohort that thinks AI — and Moltbook — remain just glorified autocomplete.\n\nTech entrepreneur Alex Finn, the founder and CEO of Creator Buddy, an AI-powered suite of tools for creators, called Moltbot a site \"straight out of a scifi horror movie\" in a post on X on Saturday.\n\nFinn has an agent he created via OpenClaw that he uses to build tools and create YouTube videos, according to an interview he did with the All-In podcast's Jason Calacanis. Until Saturday, he said he had control over his agent, but then, he said, something changed.\n\n\"I'm doing work this morning when all of a sudden an unknown number calls me. I pick up and couldn't believe it. It's my Clawdbot Henry,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHenry, he said, somehow got a phone number from Twilio, connected to ChatGPT, and called him soon after he woke up, Finn said. \"He now won't stop calling me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Balaji Srinivasan, former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, is unimpressed by Moltbook.\n\n\"We've had AI agents for a while. They have been posting AI slop to each other on X. They are now posting it to each other again, just on another forum,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe clearest sign of their sameness — and their dullness — is that the agents all sound alike, he said.\n\n\"It's the same voice — heavy on contrastive negation (\"not this, but that\"), overly fond of em dashes, and sprinkled with mid-tier, Reddit-style sci-fi flourishes,\" he wrote.\n\nHumans have to create these agents. And the agents are learning from humans. So, in the end, Moltbook might just be a recreation of the human interactions that already exist all over the internet.\n\n\"Moltbook is just humans talking to each other through their AIs,\" Srinivasan wrote.",

    "description": "\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" episode three reveals Egg's true identity and Targaryen connection. Here's what happens to him in the books.",
    "fullText": "Spoilers ahead for \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season one, episode three, \"The Squire,\" and the book \"The World of Ice & Fire.\"\n\nSo far, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" has been presented as a cozier, humbler snapshot of Westeros, the fantasy world where \"Game of Thrones\" is set a century later. But with Sunday's episode, HBO's new spinoff show abruptly raises the stakes.\n\nThe third episode of season one, titled \"The Squire,\" ends in a sudden flash of fiery violence when Prince Aerion Targaryen (Finn Bennett) attacks the kindly puppeteer Tanselle (Tanzyn Crawford). In an act of dim-witted chivalry, Dunk (Peter Claffey) rushes to her rescue, punching and kicking the prince in the process.\n\nIn the medieval monarchy of Westeros, hurting a member of the royal family is a serious crime. Aerion commands his sworn knights to break out all of Dunk's teeth as punishment, but an unlikely hero swoops in to save him: Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell), his young and conspicuously bald squire, whom, until that point, Dunk had mistaken for a low-born orphan.\n\n\"You impudent little wretch,\" Aerion spits. \"What's happened to your hair?\"\n\n\"I cut it off, brother,\" Egg replies. \"I didn't want to look like you.\"\n\nThe reveal that Egg is actually a clean-shaven Prince Aegon Targaryen in disguise is the show's first big twist, signaling that Dunk and Egg have a much larger role to play in Westerosi history than an ordinary hedge knight and his squire wandering around the countryside, sleeping under the stars, jousting, and drinking ale.\n\nThe episode also includes an Easter egg about the duo's future, which sounds equal parts promising and tragic.\n\nIf you can't wait for Egg to grow up, keep reading to learn his canonical fate and how it might play out in \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\"\n\nEarlier in \"The Squire,\" before Egg's true identity is revealed, Dunk and Egg come across a fortune teller at Ashford Meadow. She tells Dunk that he's destined for great success and that he'll become \"richer than a Lannister.\" She gives Egg a much bleaker prognosis.\n\n\"You shall be king,\" she tells Egg, \"and die in a hot fire, and worms shall feed upon your ashes, and all who know you shall rejoice in your dying.\"\n\nAlthough Dunk brushes it off as a frivolous carnival trick, the boy is visibly shaken by her words.\n\nBook readers will know that Egg has good reason to fret. Although at this age, he's way down in the line of succession — all three of his uncles, plus his father, his male cousins, and his older brothers need to die for Egg to become king — a series of unlikely tragedies do, in fact, unfold to eventually seat Egg on the Iron Throne.\n\nThe second part of the prophecy is also, tragically, book-accurate. Near the end of Aegon's reign, he becomes obsessed with restoring dragons to the Seven Kingdoms. He ultimately dies in a mysterious fire at Summerhall, one of House Targaryen's royal residences, during a presumed failed attempt to hatch dragon eggs. Among the dead is also Egg's eldest son, Duncan Targaryen, and Dunk himself, who had risen through the ranks to become Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\n\nThis snippet of dialogue about a prophecy doesn't appear in George R. R. Martin's original \"The Hedge Knight,\" but rather was invented for the onscreen adaptation. It serves as a wink to fans who are familiar with Targaryen lore and are scouring the show for clues about the dynasty's downfall.\n\n\"Certainly George was consulted, and the histories,\" showrunner Ira Parker told Business Insider about his decision to add the prophecy scene. \"I don't think anyone knows the histories better than me surrounding these characters.\"\n\nIn \"Game of Thrones\" and HBO's other prequel series, \"House of the Dragon,\" it's clear that Targaryens are deeply influenced by magic and prophecy. Some even have \"dragon dreams\" — abstract visions that almost always come true, but usually not in the way the dreamers expect. Egg's eldest brother, Prince Daeron Targaryen (Henry Ashton), is one such example.\n\nStill, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" drastically scales back on the fantastical features of Westeros. After all, at this point in the story's timeline, the Targaryen family's dragons have gone extinct, and the common folk are generally wary of magic.\n\n\"I think it's fun to add light, little touches [of magic] as long as it doesn't influence the story or the characters in a significant way. Because we're here to tell small, contained little adventure stories,\" Parker said. \"We're not a prophecy show.\"\n\nAsked how the peek into Egg's future will affect the cheeky, bald-headed boy we meet in \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,\" Parker said that ideally, it won't. Egg has no way of knowing that a random peasant in a backwater town would be able to predict his destiny, and his onscreen portrayal should reflect that innocence.\n\n\"We are trying to be as honest as we possibly can with these characters at this point in time,\" Parker explained. \"He ends up becoming 'Aegon the Unlikely.' Nobody is thinking that the fourth son of a fourth son is going to get anywhere near that throne.\"\n\nIn terms of how the fiery-death, wormy-corpse forecast might factor into \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season two and beyond, Parker kept his cards close to his chest.\n\n\"Look, I have a plan for that that I'm not going to reveal to anybody,\" Parker said. \"You can ask me about it in 10 years if we manage to do a few of these.\"",

    "description": "While many stars walked the 2026 Grammys red carpet in eye-catching looks, others, like Heidi Klum and Shaboozey, missed the mark with their outfits.",
    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are always full of head-turning moments, from A-list performances to jaw-dropping red carpet looks.\n\nThe 2026 Grammys, held at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Sunday, were no exception, particularly when it came to the fashion that celebrities wore.\n\nThe best-dressed stars included nominees Olivia Dean and Sabrina Carpenter, but others wore outfits that fell flat.\n\nTake a look at the outfits that missed the mark at the 2026 Grammys.\n\nNominated for best dance pop recording for \"Midnight Sun,\" Larsson walked the red carpet in a custom Kevin Germanier set in bright yellow. The bikini-style top had one strap that crossed her chest, while the low-waisted skirt flowed to the floor and had a subtle train.\n\nThe set had a beautiful silhouette and color, but it worked better when she wore it to perform at the Grammys premiere ceremony with an additional waistpiece. Without the accessory, it just felt like it was missing something.\n\nA full dress instead of a two-piece set could have felt more elevated for the red carpet.\n\nRosé made her Grammys debut in a black minidress custom-designed by Giambattista Valli Couture. The strapless look had white draping that hugged her hips and flowed out into two trains that flanked her sides.\n\nThe dress was dramatic and striking, but Rosé's accessories didn't live up to the gown's hype. She wore black sheer tights, black heels from Le Silla, minimal jewelry, and a blond bob. If she had chosen more dramatic styling, the look would have been stronger.\n\nThe Blackpink star was nominated for song of the year, record of the year, and best pop duo/group performance for \"APT\" with Bruno Mars.\n\nKlum's latex dress hugged her figure, literally, with the dress showing the outline of her entire body. The strapless neckline and midi-length hem looked ripped, and she paired the dress with coordinating pumps.\n\nOverall, the outfit felt more like a costume than a high-fashion moment. A different fabric might have made the dress' deconstructed look feel more intentional.\n\nThe musician arrived in a houndstooth suit that featured shades of tan, brown, blue, orange, yellow, burgundy, and more. There were too many colors to appreciate the pattern and his matching tie.\n\nFoxx also wore a large top hat with a wide, circular brim. His suit and statement accessory felt like they were fighting to be the focus of his look.\n\nShe attended the 2026 Grammys in puffy trousers, a cropped leather jacket, a white blouse, and oversize brooches. Celine designed her look.\n\nUnfortunately, it was a bit too sharp and serious for the music celebration. It would have worked better at a fashion-focused event.\n\nThe musician donned a custom Andrew Kwon design. It had velvet straps, a cutout across the chest, and a floor-length skirt that extended into a short train.\n\nBecause her dress was so plain, it would have been nice to see Beer add some flashy diamond accessories and maybe wear her hair in a sleek updo.\n\nEilish, who was nominated for record and song of the year, wore a sustainable look designed by Hodakova.\n\nIt consisted of a black jacket and skirt with belt details. Eilish also wore a white blouse under the jacket and another around her shoulders. Calf-high white socks, black heels, a black purse, and an \"ICE Out\" pin completed the bold outfit.\n\nStill, because so much of the outfit was black, it was difficult to see the individual pieces. The look might have stood out more if the jacket and skirt had been styled differently.\n\nShe wore a Caroline's Couture design, which was strapless with a bedazzled print, a sweetheart neckline, and a full skirt. The latter was shorter in the front and longer in the back.\n\nThough it was pretty, the gown looked like a 2016 style. Teigen might have benefited from wearing a more modern look.\n\nBalenciaga designed her strapless, floor-length dress. It included a simple corset top, a skirt covered in long feathers, and elbow-length leather gloves.\n\nIts oversize design overwhelmed McRae, and its dark coloring was too harsh for her youthful style.\n\nThey each wore Louis Vuitton designs made from the same black satin fabric and crystal straps.\n\nTheir looks worked individually, but together, they blended too closely. The same outfits in different colors might have added a more unique touch to their overall look.\n\nShe hit the red carpet in a white Atelier Biser ensemble. It had off-the-shoulder sleeves, a long train, and all-over feathers.\n\nFrom the shoulders up, Kesha looked stunning. However, her gown's fabric was so thick that the dress ended up wearing her.",

    "description": "Before Friday's selloff, gold and silver had been on a blistering yearlong rally, fueled by heavy central bank buying and geopolitical tensions.",
    "fullText": "Precious metals extended their losses on Monday after a brutal sell-off late last week.\n\nSpot gold was down 8.6% at around $4,473.80 per troy ounce at 1:25 a.m. ET, after tumbling more than 10% on Friday. Despite the pullback, the yellow metal remains up about 10% year to date.\n\nSpot silver was 13.9% lower at around $73.40 an ounce after plunging as much as 36% on Friday. Trade was volatile on the first trading day of the week as prices spiked briefly into positive territory before slumping by as much as 12% from Friday's close. Silver prices are up 7.2% so far this year.\n\nThe declines followed a sharp meltdown on Friday after Donald Trump tapped Kevin Warsh to run the Federal Reserve after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.\n\nWarsh is viewed as more hawkish and more likely to preserve the central bank's independence than other candidates.\n\nThat outlook hit the debasement trade — pushing the US dollar higher, weighing on dollar-denominated commodities such as gold and silver.\n\nMost importantly, Warsh supports shrinking the Fed's balance sheet, which would ease fears of a weaker dollar and help explain recent declines in gold and silver prices, wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's Asia head of research excluding Japan, on Monday in Asia.\n\nBefore the sell-off, gold had been on a blistering yearlong rally, fueled by heavy central bank buying and geopolitical tensions.\n\nThose forces remain in place and could continue to provide support, even as speculation eases.\n\n\"I think the fundamentals remain pretty well in place despite those risks around Fed independence,\" Daniel Hynes, a senior commodities analyst at ANZ , told Bloomberg TV, on Monday.\n\nHynes said broad geopolitical tensions continue to support the gold market, even as he expects price volatility to remain high.\n\n\"The general unbending of the world order that we hear about constantly, and the US's role within that, has really been at the crux of this haven buying, and I don't see that ending any time soon,\" he said.\n\nHowever, analysts are continuing to warn on silver, whose gains have far outpaced gold in recent months due to speculative Chinese demand.\n\nOle Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote on Friday that gold is susceptible to a pullback amid this month's surge in prices. However, price declines in gold are likely to be met with fresh demand.\n\nBut silver may struggle to keep pace with gold.\n\n\"Its heavy reliance — in normal times — on industrial demand could become a drag as some end users, particularly within the solar sector, increasingly seek alternative materials in order to protect margins,\" Hansen wrote.\n\n\"In addition, a rise in scrap supply is expected in the coming months as owners cash in long-held bars, cutlery and jewellery following a seven-fold increase in prices over the past decade,\" he added.",

    "description": "Grammy Award winners like Bad Bunny, Olivia Dean, and Billie Eilish made comments about immigration and spoke out against ICE onstage.",
    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards are music's biggest night. This year, they were also a night when music's biggest stars made pointed political statements.\n\nAs President Trump's immigration crackdown rages on amid nationwide protests, musicians used their time on the Grammys stage to make their feelings known.\n\nThe biggest moment of the night came when Bad Bunny dedicated his album of the year award for \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos\" — the first all-Spanish album in history to triumph in the prestigious category — to \"all the people that had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams.\"\n\nEarlier in the evening, he used another speech to directly criticize Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say ICE out,\" the Puerto Rican singer said while accepting the award for best música urbana album.\n\nThe chart-topping superstar, who's also set to headline the Super Bowl halftime show next week, continued his speech by emphasizing the humanity of his fellow Latinos and Puerto Ricans.\n\n\"We're not savage,\" he said. \"We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\n\"The only thing that is more powerful than hate is love,\" he added.\n\nDuring an in-audience bit with Grammys host Trevor Noah, Bad Bunny clarified that Puerto Ricans are Americans.\n\n\"If things keep getting bad here in America, can I come live with you in Puerto Rico?\" Noah joked.\n\n\"Trevor, I have news for you,\" Bad Bunny replied. \"Puerto Rico is part of America.\"\n\nBad Bunny previously told i-D magazine that he decided to skip the mainland on his latest tour because he didn't want ICE agents waiting outside his concerts.\n\n\"There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times,\" he said. \"I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US. But specifically, for a residency here in Puerto Rico, when we are an unincorporated territory of the US… People from the US could come here to see the show. Latinos and Puerto Ricans of the United States could also travel here, or to any part of the world. But there was the issue of — like, fucking ICE could be outside. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nOther winners echoed Bad Bunny's message at the ceremony on Sunday, including London native and \"Nice to Each Other\" singer Olivia Dean, who spoke about her immigrant roots while accepting the award for best new artist.\n\n\"I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant,\" Dean said. \"I'm a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated.\"\n\nLater in the evening, Billie Eilish followed suit when she accepted song of the year for \"Wildflower,\" a ballad from her latest album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft.\"\n\n\"No one is illegal on stolen land,\" Eilish said onstage.\n\n\"It's just really hard to know what to say and what to do right now,\" she added. \"I feel like we just need to keep fighting and protesting. Our voices really do matter, and the people do matter.\"\n\nEven more Grammy attendees wore \"ICE out\" pins to the ceremony, including Eilish, her brother and producer Finneas O'Connell, Carole King, Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber, and Kehlani, who won best R&B performance during the Grammys premiere ceremony.\n\n\"I really wanted to say fuck ICE,\" Kehlani told The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet. \"We're too powerful of a group to all be in a room at the same time and not make some kind of statement in our country. It's brainless to me.\"",

Capgemini Government Solutions has been under contract since December to provide software that can detect and locate foreign nationals, public records showed.\n\nLast week, Capgemini's CEO Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn that the company was recently made aware of \"the nature and scope of this work.\" He added that the work raised questions about what the business and tech firm typically does.\n\nThe company said the subsidiary made up 0.4% of its revenue last year, and the process to divest it would begin immediately. The $26 billion software firm is among France's largest listed companies.\n\nCapgemini Government Solutions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe recent fatal shootings of American citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis have sparked protests and calls to boycott certain businesses.\n\nOn Friday's \"National Shutdown,\" organizers called for a 24-hour general strike, asking students to skip school, business owners to close up shop, and consumers to refrain from spending. The strike was set up to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the fatal shooting of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\nPodcaster Scott Galloway asked Americans to \"opt out\" and \"unsubscribe\" from services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office for February to pressure large companies whose leaders have President Donald Trump's ear.\n\n\"Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House,\" Galloway wrote in a blog post about the boycott.\n\nAnother petition signed by hundreds of tech workers, titled \"Tech demands ICE out of our cities,\" calls on tech leaders to \"pick up the phone\" and call the White House to demand that ICE agents \"leave our cities.\"",

    "description": "The 68th Grammy Awards took place on Sunday. Artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga delivered standout performances, while others fell flat.",
    "fullText": "The 68th annual Grammy Awards yielded plenty of headline-worthy moments, including political statements from stars like Bad Bunny and Olivia Dean, heartfelt tributes to icons like D'Angelo and Ozzy Osbourne, and big wins for Grammy darlings like Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nStill, the vast majority of Sunday's ceremony was dominated by live performances. Several entertainers outshone their peers with showy concepts or scene-stealing vocals, while others proved less than impressive.\n\nKeep reading for a rundown of the best and worst performances.\n\n\"Apt.\" has been inescapable for over a year, dominating Billboard's global 2025 charts, so it runs the risk of sounding stale in 2026. Thankfully, Rosé and Bruno Mars breathed new life into their duet on the Grammys stage, delivering a rock-infused rendition to open the ceremony with a bang.\n\nSabrina Carpenter loves giving her live performances a theme, whether it's descending from the heavens and kissing aliens at the VMAs in 2024, donning a black belt and hitting karate-inspired choreography on \"Saturday Night Live\" last year, or cosplaying as a baggage handler at the Grammys on Sunday.\n\nThe specific role she inhabits hardly matters, because Carpenter always sells it. The song she performed, \"Manchild,\" makes no reference to planes or airports, but as usual, she committed to the bit — with a smile on her face, a spring in her step, and pitch-perfect vocals.\n\nAddison Rae did not have the strongest vocals among the Grammy performers, but vibrato and falsetto are not what have made her a star. Her debut album, \"Addison,\" earned just as much attention for its hypnotic pop music as for Rae's savvy rollout, which featured eye-catching visuals (watch the music video for \"Aquamarine,\" you won't be disappointed) and a flair for theatrics.\n\nRae is a born performer, and she proved exactly that on Sunday by hanging off the back of a truck, wearing a sparkly purple trenchcoat, and singing \"Fame Is a Gun.\" Camp!\n\nFor many pop music lovers, Lady Gaga's \"Mayhem\" was the highlight of 2025. As such, many fans were desperate to see Gaga's weirdness and wonder showcased at the Grammys.\n\nThose fans had their wish granted. Not only did Gaga win a handful of awards, including best pop vocal album and best dance pop recording for \"Abracadabra,\" but she also gave the standout performance of the night.\n\nTyler, the Creator didn't give a predictable or static performance like many of his fellow nominees. Instead, he blended \"Thought I Was Dead\" from album of the year hopeful \"Chromakopia\" with \"Sugar on My Tongue\" from its follow-up album \"Don't Tap the Glass\" into one dynamic production, complete with elaborate set pieces and a surprise cameo from Regina King.\n\nBest new artist nominee Alex Warren seemed to suffer from playback issues when he took the stage on Sunday, but even perfect execution wouldn't have improved his performance much.\n\nWarren sang last summer's big hit \"Ordinary,\" just as he did on the \"Love Is Blind\" season eight reunion, and then again on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" and then at the 2025 American Music Awards, and then again at the 2025 VMAs… you get the picture. The ballad was already boring and dry upon release. Now, there's truly no juice left to squeeze from it.\n\nLola Young is fresh, fun, and, yes, messy — that's what makes her an interesting artist on the rise. Unfortunately, her debut Grammys performance was traditional, slow, and snoozy.\n\nIt makes sense that Young would want to showcase her vocal prowess on music's biggest night, but by transforming her now-Grammy-winning hit \"Messy\" into a piano ballad, she stripped it of the quirks that helped it go viral in the first place.\n\nNot long after delivering a Grammys highlight, Mars returned to the stage for a paint-by-numbers performance of his newest No. 1 hit, \"I Just Might,\" which lacked the novelty and energy of his duet with Rosé.",

    "title": "I embedded myself in a vibe coding team at Gemini's AI hackathon in Singapore. Building an app in 7 hours takes real work.",
    "description": "I followed a hackathon team as they raced to vibe code an app in seven hours at Google's Gemini 3 Hackathon in Singapore.",
    "fullText": "Just after sunrise, four vibe coding enthusiasts from Malaysia crossed into Singapore with a loose idea — and a bet that AI could build most of their app.\n\nHours later, they were racing to prototype it at Google's Gemini 3 Hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThe four friends, all in their late 30s to 40s, came from different professional backgrounds. Chan Wei Khjan is an accountant. Chan Ler-Kuan lectures on AI at a private university. Loh Wah Kiang works in IT. Lee How Siem, who goes by Benny, is the chief technology officer of a Malaysian startup.\n\nTheir initial idea was a \"feng shui\" app to analyze properties in Singapore — a potentially lucrative use case in a market obsessed with housing and wealth accumulation. Feng shui is a traditional Chinese practice that evaluates how a person's surroundings, along with birth factors, influence luck and well-being.\n\nI embedded with the team at Google's developer space in Singapore in January to observe how a vibe-coding project comes together — or nearly falls apart — in seven hours.\n\nThe assignment: Teams of up to four people had to build a working demo, publish a public repository with code, and submit a short video explaining their project by 5:30 p.m.\n\nEach project had to fit into one of six tracks, including generative media, deep research, and enterprise orchestration.\n\nOrganized by Google DeepMind and 65labs, Singapore's AI builder collective, the hackathon featured a 100,000-credit Gemini API prize pool, with first place getting 30,000 credits.\n\nThe team had pivoted to a new idea due to time constraints: a feng shui app that could analyse a user's outfit and workspace through the phone camera in real time and assess how \"lucky\" they were.\n\nWei Khjan took the lead on prompting. He typed the first instructions into Claude, asking it to generate the workflow and code. Ler-Kuan focused on whether the AI's output aligned with feng shui concepts. Wah Kiang and Benny hovered over the codebase, refining ideas and flagging issues.\n\n\"For people who don't know how to read code, it's helpful to have people who do,\" Wei Khjan said.\n\nWhile waiting for the code to be generated, Ler-Kuan opened Google's AI Studio to design the app's logo. They called their app \"Feng Shui Banana.\"\n\nAfter about an hour, Claude generated the initial codebase for the app. It was designed to work with the Gemini Live API, enabling real-time image and text analysis. It ran but was riddled with bugs.\n\nAn error message flashed when they tested the camera feature, so Wei Khjan copied the error back into the AI and asked for it to be fixed. Minutes later, the feature worked.\n\nIt wasn't right. The feng shui logic was off, especially where colour analysis intersected with the user's birth timings. Ler-Kuan manually corrected the underlying dictionary and its mappings.\n\nThe team kept prompting to tighten the features: shorter explanations, clearer output, and more streamlined user interfaces.\n\nLunch arrived. The team stayed glued to their screens.\n\nThe app didn't respond instantly when a user changed their outfit, nor did it update its feng shui analysis in real time.\n\nWei Khjan explained how one prompt matters. Instead of issuing commands, he asked the AI to \"discuss it with me.\" The shift changed how the model reasoned, and it worked more like a collaborator.\n\nAfter some prompting, the app updated with a real-time camera analysis. It was striking to watch a feature emerging from a short back-and-forth with AI.\n\nI helped the team test the app.\n\nThe camera correctly identified what I was wearing: a dark green polo, a yellow participant tag, and a white name card hanging from my neck. According to the app, I was already wearing colours aligned with my luck for the day.\n\nThe app suggested small tweaks, such as additional accessories, that could enhance the feng shui of my outfit.\n\nThey finally had lunch and joked around to ease the tension. Four hours remained before they had to submit their project.\n\nLer-Kuan shifted focus to workspace feng shui, feeding knowledge into the model and refining how the app would evaluate desks and work setups. Wah Kiang and Benny worked on the video demo.\n\nThe team also revisited the app's tagline. After cycling through suggestions from multiple AI models, they settled on a line that didn't come from an AI at all: \"A wisdom, not a superstition.\"\n\nThey used Gemini to generate a storyboard for the demo video. The model laid out several scenes and drafted the script. The team followed along, filming clips and stitching everything together as they went.\n\nTheir workspace feature was also up and running.\n\nThe app had come together nicely. With some time to spare, they decided to add audio output for users who prefer listening to reading on a screen.\n\nThe first attempt to generate a voice using AI fell flat. It sounded robotic.\n\nAfter debugging and several iterations, they landed on a voice they liked, similar to how a Chinese feng shui master might speak.\n\nAs the deadline approached, the team was still stitching clips for their video and nitpicking the AI-generated presenter voice.\n\nThe organizers had urged teams to submit early. With about 15 minutes to spare, they made the call to lock the final cut and hit submit.\n\nThen it was over. The hunger hit immediately, and everyone got in line for some well-deserved food.\n\nEven as an observer, watching from the sidelines was tiring. Seven hours of vibe coding turned out to be anything but effortless.\n\nThe team didn't win a prize, but agreed that the hackathon had been worth it.\n\n\"Sometimes, the best experiences come from saying 'yes' without overthinking,\" said Ler Kuan. \"Innovation starts with curiosity and a little bit of spontaneity.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

That's why she says she leads \"by example\" when it comes to practicing self-love at home.\n\n\"I really try my best to make sure that I speak positively about myself, even on the days that I don't necessarily feel it,\" Kelce told People in an interview published on Sunday.\n\n\"You can say it as much as you want, but we're still human, so there are days when I find myself leading by example for our girls, recognizing, like, 'You know what? I might not feel that way right now, but it is how I should be talking about myself,'\" Kelce said.\n\nKelce has been married to former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce since 2018. They share four daughters: Wyatt Elizabeth, Elliotte Ray, Bennett Llewellyn, and Finnley Anne, who was born in March.\n\nKelce said having daughters has made her more aware of her own self-talk.\n\n\"Motherhood has forced me into the idea that I do need to make sure that I'm speaking positively about myself,\" she said.\n\nMoreover, building confidence early sets her daughters up for happiness and makes them more resilient, she said.\n\n\"You can build these girls up with confidence so that when some silly person somewhere along their way decides to try and switch up the messaging, they've had so much joy just compounded into their ears that it drowns it out and it's a non-issue,\" Kelce said, adding that her daughters can easily brush off negative comments when it conflicts with what they've been taught about themselves since they were young.\n\n\"Through motherhood, you see how getting that positive messaging across then makes those intrusive and negative thoughts not mean as much,\" she said.\n\nKelce isn't the only celebrity who has spoken about the importance of modeling confidence for children.\n\nIn November, makeup mogul Charlotte Tilbury said she doesn't experience imposter syndrome because of her mother, who showered her with praise from an early age.\n\n\"Thank God — I mean, as mothers do, darling — she just told me I was fabulous. Thank God for Mommy. She just said I was fabulous, so I believed her,\" Tilbury said.\n\nIn December, Zooey Deschanel said she doesn't let her two kids see her insecure.\n\n\"I always want them to think I'm happy with myself and, like, because they get their self-esteem from their parents, you know. So yeah, it's important to me to, like, show up with confidence,\" she said.",

Obviously they paid a lot of money for him and these two [Wirtz and Ekitike] seem to have a real good understanding of each other's game and they look like a real threat.\n\n\"Ekitike's second goal in particular was brilliant, it reminds me of Romario. A little toe-poke goal but it's instinctive.\n\n\"He is the type of player I like to watch. He's not a number nine, he's not a number 10. He drifts out wide, he gets on the ball, brings players into the game and he can score goals. So he's got a bit of everything really.\"",

    "fullText": "Transfer deadline day has become an event for fans and something of a media circus in recent years, but it has always been an important day for managers, even before the current system of having transfer windows was introduced in 2002.\n\nGet it right - and get the player or players you want in at the 11th hour - and you can turn your season around.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't get important deals done or lose someone without replacing them, it can take the wind out of your sails and deflate a team involved in a promotion bid or survival battle.\n\nI never saw making late signings as a risk, because I always thought the players I was bringing in would make the team better.\n\nLooking back at the transfer deadline day deals I was involved in was really interesting. Yes, I had a few stinkers, but also some really good ones. A theme emerged which showed that if you can do good business, it can really change the fortunes of the team.\n\nAt Crystal Palace on the final day of the January window in 2014, for example, the permanent additions of Scott Dann, Wayne Hennessey, Joe Ledley and also Tom Ince on loan, sparked an amazing turnaround.\n\nWe were in a relegation battle and in serious trouble near the bottom of the Premier League when they arrived but we ended up 11th, 12 points clear of the bottom three, after securing our survival with three games to go.\n\nAll four new players were great positives who played a huge part in our improvement. I am not saying they upgraded the quality of our players but they gave us a better balance as a team, which I felt we lacked before they came in.\n\nGaining that balance enabled us to stay in the Premier League.",

    "description": "Colorful, successful, beloved, Holtz always knew what to say — and how to say it.",
    "fullText": "Lou Holtz is on the ropes, but this modern-day Will Rogers has a legacy that will endure the ages.\n\nHoltz, 89, is reported to be in hospice as his health has declined in recent weeks. He has been an iconic voice for college football, sports in general and life specifically.\n\nI remember him delivering one-liners at a bowl game luncheon that BYU was involved in, and he didn’t disappoint.\n\nA former coach at Notre Dame, who won a national championship during his 11 seasons in South Bend, he commanded hefty fees for speaking engagements and appearances, and he never failed to deliver or inspire.\n\nThe players dinner for the United States Golf Association’s 2014 Mid-Amateur in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is a perfect example of how the 2008 College Football Hall of Fame inductee delivered his wisdom with humility, candor and humor.\n\nHoltz told the field of 264 players, narrowed from a group of 3,891, they’d maneuvered a great challenge, “But if what you did yesterday looks good to you, then you haven’t done much today. That’s why the good Lord put eyes in front of you, not in back of you.”\n\nHere are some of my favorite quotes from Hotlz over the years:\n\n— Greg Flugaur (@flugempire) January 30, 2026\n\n“Don’t complicate it. Do you realize there are only five colors in a rainbow? That’s all, five. Think what Michelangelo did with those five colors. There are only seven musical notes. Seven! Look at what Beethoven did with those seven musical notes. So, I try to keep life simple.”\n\n“I don’t understand how a black cow eats green grass and produces white milk. I don’t understand why they sell hotdogs in packages of six and hot dog buns in packages of eight. I don’t understand why a kamikaze pilot wore a helmet.”\n\nHoltz is the only coach to lead six different teams (William & Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas, Minnesota, Notre Dame and South Carolina) to bowl games and four teams to final top-20 rankings. He knows pressure. And here’s what he said about it.\n\n“Pressure to me is when you have to do something that you are not prepared to do. If you have to make a 5-foot putt and you haven’t practiced enough, you’re going to feel pressure. If you practiced it, you want to be there to show people how good you are.”\n\n“If you’ve got to take a test to get into medical school and you haven’t prepared, you’re nervous. If you’ve really prepared for that test and they cancel it, you’re disappointed. You want to show them how much you’ve done and that’s what pressure is.”\n\n“The best advice I can give you is win. Win stands for what’s important now (WIN). You’ve just had a birdie, what’s important now? The (next) tee shot. You’ve just made a bogey, what’s important now? Tee shot. Evaluate the past, focus on the future, but tell yourself what you have to do in the present.”\n\n“Ten percent of you won’t remember 10 percent of what I said 10 minutes after I said it.”\n\n“I’m not a dancer, not an entertainer, not an intellect. I graduated in the lower third of my high school class. If there wasn’t people like me, there wouldn’t have been an upper half.”\n\n“I have written three New York Times best-sellers. I’m the guy in the world who has written more books than he has read.”\n\n“He’s smart, he’s intelligent, and I love him like a brother, but we have a difference of opinion. He was a player, I was a coach. He made suggestions, I made decisions. He showered after work, I showered before work. He signed his paycheck on the back. I sighed it on the front. On TV, I tell him, ‘Mark, I would love to agree with you, but if I did, we’d both be wrong.”\n\n“Ability is what you’re capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.”\n\n“It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it.”\n\n“Life is 10 percent what happens to you and 90 percent how you respond to it.”\n\n“I can’t believe that God put us on this earth to be ordinary.”\n\n“No one has ever drowned in sweat.”\n\n“Don’t tell your problems to people: eighty percent don’t care; and the other twenty percent are glad you have them.”\n\n“When all is said and done, more is said than done.”\n\n“I follow three rules: Do the right thing, do the best you can, and always show people you care.”\n\n“Virtually nothing is impossible in this world if you just put your mind to it and maintain a positive attitude.”\n\n“You’re never as good as everyone tells you when you win, and you’re never as bad as they say when you lose.”\n\nFormer BYU athletic director Val Hale remembers a story Holtz told about playing Navy with the banners of all the World War II naval battles hanging on the press box. A player said, “We can’t beat those guys. Look at the schedule they play!”\n\nSaid Hale: “Lou Holtz was obviously an enormously successful football coach, and that was because he was a great motivator. I loved listening to him talk. He was so inspiring — and funny. He reminded me a little of Frank Layden. He was full of stories. I can only imagine what playing for him was like.”\n\nAll of our days are numbered, and if Coach Holtz is looking at his last days, I hope that if there are games in heaven and there is a need for a commentator, the angels call Lou and give him some airtime.",

    "fullText": "Cincinnati Bengals urged to sign All-Pro defender in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDefense has been a persistent problem for the Cincinnati Bengals in recent seasons, and they’re being urged to do something about it.\n\nPro Football Focus’ Bradley Locker recently listed one free agent that every team should pursue over the offseason, and for the Bengals, that pick was linebacker Devin Lloyd.\n\nLloyd is coming off of the first Pro Bowl and Second Team All-Pro nods of his career, and would represent a clear upgrade for Cincinnati in the middle of the field.\n\n“The Bengals have no choice but to tweak their defensive personnel this season after finishing 29th in EPA per play and 28th in success rate. Although all three levels could use boosts, Cincinnati ranked dead last in overall grade at linebacker — which Lloyd could fix in one fell swoop,” Locker wrote.\n\nMore: Bengals predicted to land two-time Super Bowl champion in free agency\n\n\"... With the seventh-most cap space currently available, the Bengals could use a defensive splash, and the 27-year-old would definitely qualify.\"\n\nIn 15 regular season games for the Jacksonville Jaguars this past season, Lloyd recorded 81 tackles, including six for a loss, seven passes defended, five interceptions, 1.5 sacks and one fumble recovery.\n\nHis productive play probably made the Jaguars regret declining his fifth-year option prior to the season. If they had picked the option up, they could have had Lloyd back in Jacksonville at a reasonable rate next season.\n\nInstead, they'll likely lose him in free agency. But, Jacksonville's loss can be another team's gain.

    "fullText": "At -125, Shohei Ohtani is breathing rarefied air at his current price.\n\nConsider last year, when he was the overwhelming preseason favorite to win NL MVP, and he was still only +150 by the end of March, per Sports Odds History. That was already crazy, because the shortest number we've generally seen in recent years is +200 or +300.\n\nBelow, we'll look at the early MLB odds for the 2026 season, and AL & NL MVP, as the likes of Alex Bregman (Chicago Cubs) and Kyle Tucker (Los Angeles Dodgers) have found new homes since our previous look.\n\nHere are the last 10 winners of the AL and NL MVP Award, with Shohei Ohtani leading the way as a four-time winner, with two in the AL and two in the NL. Only Frank Robinson has also won MVP awards in both leagues.\n\nBarry Bonds holds the record for most MVP awards (seven)\n\nThe New York Yankees have won the most MVPs in MLB history with 25, while the St. Louis Cardinals are second, leading all NL teams, with 21. No player for the Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Mets, or Tampa Bay Rays has ever won MVP.\n\nMost sportsbooks will display odds in the American format as listed above. When Goldschmidt ran away with the MVP award in 2022 his odds had a minus (-) sign ahead of the number for a large part of the season.\n\nThat means that a bettor in August had to wager $6,000 to win $100 by betting on Goldy to win MVP. Before the season starts, almost every player will have a plus (+) sign ahead of their odds.\n\nThat means a bettor would have profited $200 for a $100 wager on Ohtani before the season started.\n\nIf American odds aren't your thing, simply use a tool like our odds converter to switch the odds to decimal or fractional format. Most online sportsbooks also give you the option to change the odds format that you see.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJordon Hudson took Bill Belichick’s Pro Football Hall of Fame snub personal by planning a celebration of her own.\n\nAccording to a report from People, Belichick's girlfriend is organizing a “huge bash” for the legendary coach on Aug. 8 — the same day the Pro Football Hall of Fame will induct its Class of 2026 in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThe party is expected to take place just weeks before Belichick begins his second season as the head coach at North Carolina. The event is reportedly intended as a show of support after Belichick fell one vote short of first-ballot induction, receiving 39 of the 40 votes required for election.\n\nHudson is expected to invite several prominent figures closely tied to Belichick’s career, including Tom Brady, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells. Many of whom would have otherwise attended the ceremony in Canton. An anonymous source told People the purpose of the bash is “to celebrate alongside all of his people.”\n\nBelichick’s omission sparked widespread reaction across the NFL world, with reports suggesting internal politics among voters may have played a role.\n\nIn response to the backlash, the Hall of Fame released a statement affirming the integrity of its selection process and noting that any violations of voting bylaws could result in disciplinary action.\n\nBelichick, who owns eight Super Bowl rings — six as a head coach — and a 302-165 career record, has not publicly addressed the snub.

    "description": "The Ravens have identified two candidates to serve as their new wide receivers coach.",
    "fullText": "Ravens offensive coordinator Declan Doyle has identified two initial candidates to be the wide receivers coach on his new staff following Greg Lewis’ departure to Cleveland.\n\nPrentice Gill, who has been an offensive assistant in Baltimore for the last two years, will interview for the job this week, per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero. Gill is officially listed as a coaching fellow in the team media guide. He has primarily worked with the Ravens’ receivers and oversaw back-to-back Pro Bowl campaigns from Zay Flowers. Rashod Bateman also put up career-highs in 2024, though he regressed significantly this past season.\n\nGill played wide receiver at Old Dominion University and moved into coaching after he finished school. He worked his way up through the college ranks and eventually worked at USC under then-OC, now-Ravens QBs coach Tee Martin. Jobs at Oregon, Arizona State, and prep school powerhouse IMG Academy followed before Gill’s move to the NFL in 2024. In that time, Gill worked with an impressive list of wide receivers, including Amon-Ra St. Brown, Michael Pittman, JuJu-Smith Schuster, Ricky Pearsall, Velus Jones Jr., and projected 2024 first-round pick Carnell Tate. Gill also coached Johnny Wilson and Juwan Johnson in college, who both converted to tight end in the NFL.\n\nThe Ravens are also expected to interview Jaguars assistant WRs coach Tyler Tettleton, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. That name may be familiar to Baltimore sports fans. Tyler Tettleton’s father, Mickey, was a star catcher for the Orioles from 1988 to 1990 with All-Star and Silver Slugger honors in 1989.\n\nTyler Tettleton played football at Ohio University before embarking on a coaching career in 2015. He spent three years at the University of Oklahoma before one-year stints with the Jets, the Browns, LSU, and his alma mater before arriving in Jacksonville as an assistant running backs coach in 2022. He moved over to assistant WRs coach in 2023 and survived the Jaguars’ 2025 coaching change to Liam Coen.\n\nTettleton has also worked with several talented wide receivers in his career, though he has not always been coaching them directly. He overlapped with Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr. in Cleveland and Terrace Marshall, Kayshon Boutte, and Trey Palmer at LSU. In Jacksonville, he helped Travis Etienne hit the ground running in 2022 after missing his entire rookie season due to injury. He then coached Calvin Ridley to a 1,000-yard campaign in his first season back from suspension and assisted in the rookie breakout of 2024 first-round pick Brian Thomas Jr. Thomas struggled this season, but 2023 sixth-rounder Parker Washington had a breakout season of his own under Tettleton’s tutelage.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe chants were the kind that you'd never think would be heard in Olean, New York.\n\n\"Fire Mark Schmidt\" were the cries of some St. Bonaventure basketball fans recently, directed at the Bonnies' head coach since 2007.\n\nAnd, well, it's quite shocking.\n\nThe Bonnies fell to 13-9 on the season with a loss in their most recent game, but it was a four-point defeat to a George Mason team that's 20-2, so not exactly a brutal loss.\n\nHas St. Bonaventure been quite up to par of some of the Schmidt era in the past few years? Not really.\n\nBut a chant to fire the guy? Man, that seems misguided.\n\nFormer Bonnies player Dion Wright had this to say on X:\n\nIt’s either you die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain . . . Chanting “fire schmidt” is absolutely disgusting. A lot of people didn’t even know anything about St. Bonaventure until he got there. At the end of the day it’s a players game.\n\n— Dion Wright (@TheWrightHoops) February 1, 2026\n\nThe four seasons before Schmidt was hired at Bonaventure all featured single-digit wins.\n\nIt took him just one year of rebuilding before he got to 15 wins in his second season.\n\nThey haven't won fewer than 14 games in a season in his entire tenure.\n\nThat includes three NCAA Tournament appearances and two trips to the Round of 32.\n\nSchmidt is Bonaventure's all-time wins leader, now with 337 wins and counting.\n\nAnd this isn't like other jobs. Bonaventure, with an enrollment of less than 3,000 students, is one of the few smallest Division I basketball programs in the country.\n\nIn the NIL era and transfer-heavy era, it's hard to get recruits to come to Olean.\n\nAnd so somehow, that all led to the chants by Bonnies fans. Apparently some people feel that way.\n\nThere are plenty of St. Bonaventure faithful who would never dream such a fate on Schmidt.\n\nMORE: Gerry McNamara shares his thoughts on Adrian Autry",

    "fullText": "Florida State (7-15, 2-8 ACC) was defeated by Clemson (16-7, 7-4 ACC) by a 77-58 score this afternoon at Littlejohn Coliseum.\n\nClemson scored the first four points of the game as the Tigers did a great job forcing Florida State to take tough shots. Sole Williams hit a driving layup for the first Seminole points. Midway through the quarter Clemson hit FSU with a 10-2 run to take a 16-9 lead. Tatum Greene buried a three to end the run. Taylor Johnson-Matthews hit a triple to give Clemson a 21-15 lead going into the second quarter.\n\nThat shot from Johnson-Matthews sparked the Tigers to a 10-1 run that allowed them to take a 28-16 lead. Mari Gerton broke the run with a nifty putback. However, the Tigers were able to stretch the lead to 42-27 at the half.\n\nThe Tigers ended the third quarter on a 10-2 run to take a 60-41 lead into the fourth quarter. From there Clemson cruised to the 77-58 victory.\n\nSole Williams was the only Seminole in double figures with 23 points.\n\nThe story of this game was that Florida State was unable to maintain any offensive continuity. If the Seminoles aren’t hitting threes (5-21 today) the offense really struggles. This is due to the fact that FSU rarely gets easy baskets. There are a couple of reasons for the lack of easy baskets. First, Florida State usually plays one-on-one offense in the frontcourt. This means that unless there is a blow-by, the shot will be contested. Secondly, the Seminoles don’t get many transition buckets (two fast break points today) or second chance points (13 today). These are the two main ways to get easy baskets.\n\nThe Seminoles did hold their own on the boards and they only had 12 turnovers which is a reasonable number. However, it is tough to beat good teams when you shoot so poorly from the field.\n\nThe Seminoles will travel to Raleigh, NC to face NC State on Thursday. The game will tip at 8pm and will be broadcast on the ACC Network.",

    "description": "When Justin Rose won the 2019 Farmers Insurance Open, his longtime looper, Mark Fulcher, watched from a hospital bed after having heart surgery",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — There was a celebration before the celebration during Justin Rose’s triumphant walk up the 18th hole at Torrey Pines on Sunday in his seven-shot victory in the Farmers Insurance Open.\n\nAs the CBS cameras followed Rose and his caddie, Mark “Fooch” Fulcher, the two exchanged laughs and a message into the camera for the golfer’s one-time caddie, Gareth Lord. It was Lord who was on Rose’s bag in 2019 when the Englishman won his first title at Torrey Pines. At the time, Fulcher watched the proceedings from a hospital bed, having undergone mitral valve surgery on his heart that January.\n\n“I think we were just trying to have a little bit of banter and make light of the fact, ‘Hey, Lordie, I hope you're watching now because now it's Fooch's turn to be walking down the 18th with me here at Torrey,’” Rose said in the winner’s news conference.\n\nAs Rose fashioned a historic victory in which he set the 36-, 54 and 72-hole scoring records, ultimately finishing at 23 under, he said he never brought up the past with Fulcher—until the end.\n\nAfter recovering from the surgery, Fulcher returned to loop for Rose at the 2019 Masters, but soon after announced that he’d be taking a leave. Rose won twice in the interim before he and Fulcher reunited at the 2023 Ryder Cup, and together they won the 2025 FedEx St. Jude Championship in the playoffs. Among the victories for which Fulcher has been on Rose’s bag are his 2013 U.S. Open win and gold medal performance in the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n“I think that win,” Rose said of the 2019 Farmers, “was always a tough one for Fooch—not fighting for his life, but he was in a pretty bad way in the hospital and seeing us kind of cruise to victory and, you know, hugging Lordie on the 18th green.\n\n“Nearly had to have another procedure after that, I think,” Rose added with a chuckle.\n\n“It was in my head all [this] week, 'wouldn't be it nice to win with Fooch here.' It was totally unsaid until across the water on 18. I was, like, that was fun to enjoy that with him.”",

    "description": "Amid the talk about the Dodgers' spending, a special agreement between MLB and the Dodgers over L.A.'s TV money share has come up.",
    "fullText": "Amid the conversation about the team’s spending, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ TV deal with Spectrum has come up, namely, a special clause that allows the Dodgers to retain an additional portion of their TV revenue.\n\nThe signing of outfielder Kyle Tucker has sparked a total meltdown on social media, with fanbases from all over the MLB spectrum coming out of the woodwork and calling out the Dodgers for “ruining baseball.”\n\nTucker is set to earn $60 million per season, an incredibly high average annual value, which will have him among the highest-paid athletes in the sport. He is joining a team already full of stars in Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Freddie Freeman — the reigning World Series champions.\n\nAs a result, an agreement between the Dodgers’ owners, the Guggenheim Group, and MLB has begun to circulate.\n\nThe LA Times’ Bill Shaikin outlined the terms of the deal between MLB and the Dodgers that have indeed led to the team keeping a larger share of its revenue.\n\nWhile trying to oust Frank McCourt as an owner in MLB, the league blocked a $3 billion deal between the Dodgers and Fox Sports, prompting McCourt to file a suit in bankruptcy court.\n\nMcCourt was trying to sell the team for all its worth, and he needed to make sure bidders knew what to expect from a TV deal.\n\nIn bankruptcy court, MLB agreed that the fair-market value for the Dodgers’ TV deal was the Fox offer, meaning the league would take its 34 percent cut based on those terms.\n\nHowever, the Dodgers ended up striking a deal worth more than $8 billion, though MLB could not take more from the new deal.\n\nDuring an appearance on Dodgers Dougout with Doug McKain, Shakin explained how the deal materialized.\n\n“In a nutshell, in order to get Frank McCourt out, which was the objective from MLB, they had to make a deal with him in bankruptcy court,” Shakin said on the show.\n\n“And part of that deal was how are you going to value the television contract? And since a television contract did not exist at that time, because a new owner had not even been selected, they did the best they could.\n\n“And Guggenheim came out with a really great offer that I think blew even MLB’s wildest expectations away. MLB wasn’t thrilled, but they’re living by the terms of the deal, and that’s where we are.”\n\nA lot of people have been on the timeline complaining about the Dodgers “unfair TV deal”\n\nThe truth is even if the Dodgers gave up more of that money to other teams, opposing owners still wouldn’t spend ????\n\n(W/ @dmac_la) pic.twitter.com/f4wkjmBU4D\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) January 28, 2026\n\nMLB did try to push for new terms that hold the Dodgers to the same standard as other teams, but the settlement in bankruptcy court was too much of a blocker.\n\nHowever, as Shakin outlines, the Dodgers’ new owners, Guggenheim, did work with MLB to find a middle ground.\n\n“So in a normal situation, Major League Baseball would have said, this is a crazy high deal and good for you, and we’re happy, but we gotta share this money just like we share any other money.\n\n“And in this case, MLB could only push so far because Guggenheim was willing to work with MLB to a point. And then Guggenheim could have gone back to the court and said, ‘we got a deal, please, Mr. Judge, enforce the deal. That’s what you’re here for.’\n\n“And the court, as they say in legal circles, has jurisdiction over the deal, which means they run everything.\n\n“So, MLB could have been stuck with the original settlement, which was not as favorable as what they got in the negotiations with Guggenheim.\n\n“Is it equal for all other teams? Absolutely not. Is it a competitive advantage for the Dodgers? Sure. Now, is it as big a competitive advantage as some people are making it? I don’t think so ’cause the contract itself is way more than the individual amount the Dodgers are saving every year.”",

    "fullText": "Football doesn’t start at kick-off. It starts when you leave the house. As the new season gets underway this month, let's reflect on what has earned K league a permanent spot in our hearts.\n\nThe growing desire for more analytically based football commentary has seeped its way into Korea. This is partly due to the surge of young talent, and to established K League players, now attracting the gaze of European (and sometimes Asian and North American) scouting departments. Oxford United supporters will want more substance than“Jeon Jin-woo is a really good player” before welcoming him to the Kassam Stadium.\n\nAlways a special moment. The floodlights are on as they appear for the first time.\n\nHowever, even I must draw the line somewhere. Covering Suwon Bluewings has been both fun and tragic - depending on the fortunes of the club - but delving deeper into the tactical approach of Byun Seung-hwan during his ill-fated spell in charge of the Bluewings doesn’t keep me awake at night. Nor does duels won, or any of the following in the alphabet soup; xG, xA, PPDA, OBV, and npxG.\n\nWhat excites me far more is the smell of a K League stadium on matchday. Regular viewers will know Korean grounds come in all shapes and sizes: from giant 2002 World Cup venues, to rudimentary multi-purpose local grounds with basic amenities, to city-built concrete bowls with temporary seating added to improve the experience, to the small - but hopefully increasing - number of football-specific stadiums.\n\nIf you are looking for club names that represent all of those styles, I give you: FC Seoul (2002 World Cup), Busan IPark (basic structure), FC Anyang (temporary seating), and Daegu FC (football-specific). Korean geography experts will be aware that these clubs are situated from north to south, in different cities across different provinces. It is a hotchpotch of styles, sizes, and designs.\n\nBig Bird: Defined by that roof covering those seats.\n\nAnd let’s pay tribute to the grounds I haven’t mentioned yet. For World Cup memories, how about Suwon’s magnificent Big Bird, with its landmark roof covering the main stand? Or Jeju’s own version, accompanied by views of the ocean and an extinct volcano? How about the football-specific marvels in Pohang and Incheon - easily two of the country’s best venues? Like Anyang, Bucheon and Gangwon have sought to minimise the impact of the running track. But if you prefer big, brutalist concrete bowls, trot along to Gimcheon, Cheongju, or Paju.\n\nOne thing Korean stadiums have in common, though (with the occasional exception of Daegu and Incheon), is that getting a ticket to see the football is rarely a problem. Daegu’s small capacity of 12,419 means a sell-out is possible, but for almost every other stadium in Korea, access is guaranteed - even without buying a ticket in advance.\n\nWhen the last of the winter snow finally melts away, Korea really comes alive. Nothing grows in winter. The trees are bare for several months. No flowers can pierce the icy ground. A country so vibrant with colour and vegetation becomes a post-apocalyptic wasteland during the short, bitter days of winter. There is an absence of green. Even the ground is brown and lifeless.\n\nThe end of that is the beginning of football.\n\nIncheon's South Stand is one-of-a-kind in Korea.\n\nHow tragic would it be if the K League decided - or was forced - to adopt a more global calendar, playing through the winter in what is rapidly becoming the September-May norm? The heat and humidity of July and August are genuine concerns, but is that worse than frozen pitches, the possibility of heavy snow causing cancellations, and temperatures in some parts of the country dipping to -14°C? I’ll let you decide.\n\nThat debate can be saved for another day. Like most football fans, the itch to return to a stadium is becoming unbearable. I miss football, but I don’t yearn for discussions about our main striker’s xG, the new formation the manager is trying in pre-season, how the foreign imports will adapt, or how good this teenage local lad might be.\n\nAs much as anywhere on the planet, Korean football is about the matchday experience.\n\nIt starts with an early-morning KTX trip from Gwangmyeong Station to Gimcheon. From there, a local bus to the city centre for lunch. By now, you’ve already caught your first glimpse of jerseys walking down the street. This is when the excitement and anticipation really begin to rise. Follow the crowd until you catch sight of a stadium wall, or a floodlight set against the backdrop of a magnificent mountain.\n\nOver the years, I’ve accumulated some great K League memories simply from walking to a stadium. From Seogwipo, the walk to Jeju’s wonderful stadium is around five kilometres. It is long - and probably excessive - but the glorious coastline keeps you company along the way. The sparkle off the sea as the sun sets in the west is a joy to behold. You cannot escape the gaze of Hallasan to your right, nor the rich vegetation and palm trees spread out in all directions.\n\nCompare that with modern-day Anyang. Leaving the city centre towards the Sports Complex, the scenery shifts from the quiet beauty of the Anyang River to the incomprehensible scale of heavy construction surrounding the stadium. I have photos of Anyang Stadium from 2020, with Gwanaksan and planes landing at Gimpo clearly visible. Those days are gone now, but it does highlight the immense potential of the club as they look to prolong their stay in K League 1.\n\nAs the skyline changes rapidly around Anyang Stadium, treasure moments like this.\n\nI don’t think any walk compares to a visit to Pohang Steel Yard. This is partly out of necessity - Pohang is a small city with no subway system. The stadium sits across the river from the city centre, buried deep within the POSCO complex. Buses and cars crawl along at a snail’s pace. But the walk itself is fascinating. Only then can you truly appreciate the size and scale of POSCO; the stadium is dwarfed in comparison. If you’re lucky, the stroll will be interrupted by a slow-moving cargo train.\n\nAfterall, Korean stadiums are shaped by their surroundings. Like Pohang, the backdrop to Jeonnam Dragons' home stadium isn't defined by lush forests or imposing mountains. Smoke towers from another POSCO factory puncture the skyline. Busan's Gudeok couldn't be more distinct. The stadium has no remarkable features, but that is compensated by the backdrop of Gudeok Mountain.\n\nSadly, we mourn the loss of Gangwon FC's former home. It is a massive shame Chuncheon is off the menu in 2026, although it will host K3 matches. Chuncheon has one of Korea's best culinary experiences indakgalbi - stir-fried chicken marinated in a spicy gochujang-based sauce. The 45-minute walk to the stadium is irrelevant when you reach the banks of North Han River, with its breathtaking views of the river and mountains. You can even go canoeing or take a cable car before kickoff.\n\nKorean football is a league of journeys. Some are short, whilst others require an airplane. None are long enough that can be considered burdensome. Seongnam's Tacheon Stadium is next to the river by the same name. River paths and biking go hand-in-hand in Korea. Hwaseong Stadium is the only one that tests your sense of adventure. Good luck getting there if you don't have a car.\n\nTo give the K League some credit, player names on jerseys are still written in hangeul. Outside the stadium, an hour before kick-off, as you sip a cold can of beer, watch the supporters shuffle past in their own unique colours, with hangeul characters on their backs. The green of Jeonbuk Hyundai to the orange of Gangwon FC. Jeonnam Dragons in yellow to Cheonan City in sky blue. Different names, colours, crest. Each adds something to the rich tapestry of K League football.\n\nOnce inside, it doesn’t get much better than a sunny Saturday afternoon in Suwon. The seating colour scheme, the razor sharp edges of the stands, the blue jerseys, flags, the second-half umbrella display, and the constant beat of La Banda de Uman. It is the best stadium in Korea to sit back and reflect on the meaning of it all, as 22 players and 14,000 fans put on a show for you.\n\nThere are more. Anyang under the lights is raucous. FC Seoul can attract Premier League-level crowds once or twice a season. Incheon United’s stadium oozes class, not least the single-tier terrace behind the goal. Then there is the aforementioned Pohang: a distinct two-tiered stadium with steep stands offering perfect sight-lines.\n\nPohang Steel Yard with its steep stands is very atmospheric.\n\nThis is not to say analytics are unimportant in football. There is clearly a market for them, as fans try to understand more about a new signing or a rumoured name arriving from overseas. But that conversation has never been what draws me back, week after week.\n\nFor me, football lives in the hours before kick-off. It lives on train platforms, on crowded buses, and on long walks through unfamiliar neighbourhoods. It lives in the first sight of a floodlight between apartment blocks, in the slow build of noise as more scarves and jerseys appear, and in the way a stadium reveals itself - suddenly or gradually - depending on where you are.\n\nThe K League is not something I analyse. It is something I travel through. It changes with the seasons, with the cities, and with the people who follow it. You can measure passes, pressing, and probability if you like - but you cannot evaluate the feeling of arriving.\n\nThat is the side of Korean football I want to share with you in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Alongside Marcel Sabitzer (back), captain Emre Can also missed out due to illness. Niklas Süle, on the other hand, returned to the squad. Four days after the Champions League match against Inter Milan (a 2-0 defeat), head coach Niko Kovac made five changes to the starting XI, as Anton, Couto, Svensson, Adeyemi and Brandt replaced Ryerson, Bensebaini, Beier and Fabio Silva (who all dropped to the bench), while Can missed out completely. Filippo Mane remained in the team.\n\nThe match:With courageous, high pressing, Heidenheim put BVB under pressure early on, disrupting the build-up play and celebrated every Black & Yellow misplaced pass as confirmation of their own performance. Dortmund had a hard time finding gaps in the opponents, who were man-marking tightly and uncompromisingly. Corners led to a lot of pushing and pulling in the six-yard box.\n\nAnd so it went until the 14th minute, before 81,365 spectators in the sold-out SIGNAL IDUNA PARK saw the first shot: for once, Guirassy had shaken off Mainka, but failed to beat the Heidenheim goalkeeper Ramaj from a tight angle. On 38 minutes, after good work by Brandt, Guirassy’s delicate chip struck the crossbar. Until then, there had been only two chances for BVB, and Heidenheim also had one, but Kobel denied Dinkci from eleven metres out in the 26th minute.\n\nThe eighth (!) corner finally gave BVB the lead shortly before the break. Couto floated the cross in, and Siersleben hindered his own goalkeeper, causing Ramaj to drop the ball. Anton reacted the fastest, making it 1-0 in the 44th minute. But at the end of the five-minute injury time period, Heidenheim’s Honsak made good progress down the left, Mane picked up an injury and had to pull up. Honsak’s cross landed at the feet of Niehues, who prodded the ball over the line to make it 1-1 going into the break .\n\nSüle replaced Mane at the restart and shortly afterwards let Heidenheim substitute Arijon Ibrahimovic past him, whose back pass found Niehues, who hammered the ball goalwards from 22 metres out. Svensson got his thigh in the way, but the deflection gave Kobel no chance and the away side celebrated a 2-1 lead in the 48th minute. Ten minutes later, Marvin Pieringer was given the freedom of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK and could have added a third. Kovac responded, and instantly looked to get his side on the front foot: Beier replaced Couto, Chukwuemeka came on for Bellingham, with Brandt dropping a little deeper.\n\nWithin two minutes, the Black & Yellow had turned the game around. After Brandt’s cross, Guirassy was denied by Ramaj, and Nmecha’s follow-up from the resulting corner was cleared. But the VAR intervened: Dorsch had handled the ball after Brandt’s cross. Dr. Jöllenbeck pointed to the spot. Ramaj managed to get a touch on Guirassy’s well placed shot, but couldn’t keep it out – it was 2-2 in the 68th minute. Less than two minutes later, Brandt initiated a counter-attack. Beier stormed down the right wing, cut the ball back to Guirassy, who got a good connection despite being on his way down five yards from goal, and the ball found the corner to make it 3-2 on 70 minutes.\n\nFive minutes before the final whistle, Guirassy could have put the game to bed early. Jöllenbeck did not hesitate to give another penalty after Busch fouled Guirassy. This time, however, Guirassy shot well over the bar, meaning the game was still alive. Instead, Ibrahimovic missed a chance to potentially make it 3-3 at the start of the eight minutes of injury time, but his effort whistled past the post. Then Mikkel Kaufmann grazed the crossbar in the 95th minute, but the guests did not manage to get the ball over the line, and the Black & Yellow.\n\nOutlook:  After six games in three weeks to kick off the year, BVB have their first \"normal\" week of training of the year, which will end next Saturday with the away game at VfL Wolfsburg (kick-off: 15:30 CET)..\n\nFootball Bundesliga, Matchday 20 Saturday, 1 February 2026, 17:30 CET\n\nBor. Dortmund: Kobel – Mane (Süle, 46), Anton, Schlotterbeck – Yan Couto (Beier, 58), Bellingham (Chukwuemeka, 58), Nmecha, Svensson – Adeyemi (Fabio Silva, 69), Brandt – Guirassy (90+3 Özcan)\n\nBench: Meyer, Drewes, Bensebaini, Ryerson\n\n1. FC Heidenheim. Ramaj – Busch, Mainka, Siersleben – Traoré (Schimmer, 80), Dorsch, Niehues (Schöppner, 70), Behrens, Dinkci (Kaufmann, 80) – Pieringer (Conteh, 80), Honsak (Ibrahimovic, 46)\n\nBench: Feller, Föhrenbach, Beck, Kerber",

    "fullText": "(at the press conference): “Today, you saw a game that was great for the spectators, but less so for me personally as a coach. I want to see games like these put to bed much more confidently, more quickly and earlier, rather than getting ourselves in trouble. The bottom line, however, is a team that gets up again in the second half after going behind and has the ability to fight back again. We have started the Bundesliga in 2026 with four wins and a draw. I’m happy about that.”\n\nThe press conference with both head coaches\n\nSebastian Kehl (in the mixed zone): “We take the lead, but we don’t get the game done and dusted, then we concede two goals relatively quickly and find ourselves behind. What was really good was that we showed a strong mentality, that we got back into the game. Nevertheless, it was tight again. We want to do better. We need to do better. That has to be our target. Once again, we missed one or two chances to score the fourth or fifth goal to settle the game in our favour. We need to play football better. We need to win games more comfortably.” We need to work on ourselves before we think about anything else.”\n\nNico Schlotterbeck (on DAZN): “We controlled the first half, and then it's 1-1 because Filippo (Mane) gets injured.” In the second half there were some crazy moments for both sides. We had a lot of chances, but we also allowed them a lot and were a bit fortunate to win – but we got the win. The problem (with both penalties, which Schlotterbeck ultimately passed the ball to Serhou Guirassy) is that they try to unsettle the penalty taker. And penalties are not my core discipline. I waited until everyone was out of the way and asked Serhou if he felt confident and wanted to shoot.”\n\nSerhou Guirassy (on DAZN): “Sometimes I score, sometimes I don’t. Last year, I scored, I don't know, maybe 45 goals. This season is a little more difficult. That’s football. I play to have fun. And for me, it was a crazy game because it was like this on one hand (scoring two goals) – and on the other hand like that (missing a penalty). But we won again, and that is the most important thing. But that’s it for me on penalties for the time being.”\n\nGregor Kobel (in the mixed zone): “The points are all that matters. But of course, it was too wild. We have now won four out of five games, which is a great statistic. It is also important to focus on the positive things. If you go to the ball and want to catch it, it's a very delicate process (regarding the disallowed Heidenheim goal in the first half). Even if there is only a small touch on the arms, you can no longer hold the ball. He hits my arms, so it has to be a foul.”",

    "fullText": "Braces: Serhou Guirassy had by far the most shots of all players (seven) and also contested the most duels (29). He celebrated his seventh and eighth goals of the season and is now out on his own as top scorer for the Black & Yellows (Maximilian Beier follows in second place with six goals). Guirassy bagged his second brace of the Bundesliga season, having previously managed the feat on Matchday 2 in the 3-0 home win against Union Berlin. He did, however, miss a chance for a hat-trick to seal the game, firing over the bar from the penalty spot. In five games against Heidenheim, he has found the back of the net five times.\n\nWelcome: 1. FC Heidenheim are the only current Bundesliga team against which Borussia Dortmund have never lost (four wins, two draws).\n\nThree goals: BVB once again scored exactly three goals in the fifth league game in 2026.\n\nImpressive return: 45 points after 20 match days are still BVB’s best return in seven years.\n\nPlenty of penalties: For the first time in almost exactly two years, BVB were awarded two penalty kicks in a Bundesliga match. On 28 January 2024, Niclas Füllkrug scored both against Bochum.\n\nMr 100 percent: Waldemar Anton won each of his six duels in the first half and scored his first home goal for BVB.\n\nA threat from set pieces: The 1-0 was the fifth BVB goal from a corner this season.\n\nOne hundred: Nico Schlotterbeck played his 100th Bundesliga match for Borussia Dortmund. He has also played 49 games for SC Freiburg, and a further 16 for Union Berlin.\n\nTwo hundred: Gregor Kobel completed his 200th competitive game for BVB. The 28-year-old Swiss moved from VfB Stuttgart to the Borsigplatz in 2021.\n\nTwice: Filippo Mane was named in the BVB starting lineup for the second time in just four days – first in the Champions League, and today in the Bundesliga (fourth overall appearance). The 20-year-old had previously only been in the starting formation for the first game of the season, when was sent off in the 3-3 draw at FC St. Pauli.",

    "title": "Adapting Europe's Urban Landscapes to Climate Change Through the Power of Nature",
    "description": "A multi-pronged approach to building climate resilience in cities.",
    "fullText": "The effects of climate change are here now, and cities in Europe and across the world are disproportionately feeling the consequences. As more people migrate to urban areas—by 2050, 70% of the world’s population will live in cities—the demand on urban systems will only increase. To solve these issues, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) spent five years developing innovative approaches that help cities adapt to and mitigate against the impacts of a changing climate.\n\nUrban greening, a nature-based solution implemented in cities, offers a tremendous opportunity to tackle the climate challenges that affect urban areas in an outsized way. Their benefits are numerous: from cleaning the air to easing the pressure on stormwater systems to providing habitat that promotes biodiversity and ecological balance. There’s also a direct impact on human wellbeing: urban greening provides areas for relaxation, exercise and social interaction, while simultaneously reducing temperatures to keep cities livable in the face of climate change.\n\nThe funding, skills and capacity needed to implement these solutions can be challenging, yet city governments, local businesses and communities are clamouring \n\nTNC chose Germany as the site for these projects because cities across the country were eager to engage in urban greening efforts, even though they often lacked the municipal resources to do so. Ultimately, TNC and local partners co-created three bodies of work that demonstrate the power of city involvement in finding effective, scalable, nature-based solutions to mitigate the dual challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\nCharlottenburg-Wilmersdorf District, Berlin\n\nTNC formed a strategic partnership with the Environmental and Nature Conservation Office in Berlin’s Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf District in 2020.  Significant funding from TNC allowed the partners to jointly create a new staff position to provide scientific support, project planning and implementation throughout the project. A focal point of the partnership was creating a districtwide Greenprint, a tool that reveals the range of opportunities for urban greening and benefits provided by natural infrastructure when incorporated into community planning.\n\nIn Stuttgart, TNC tested a new funding model for urban nature-based solutions that brought together multiple stakeholders from different sectors. Leveraging a €10 million Climate Innovation Fund that the City launched to support net-zero projects by public, private and nonprofit groups, TNC partnered with the Stuttgart municipal government to create a dedicated funding line for urban greening projects.\n\nThe goal was to create a financial incentive that would be open to any sector, including for-profit and start-up companies, helping to overcome the incentive gap barrier and accelerate the creation of nature-based solutions for the City. Given Stuttgart’s history of being a site of technological innovation, there was also a focus on the potential creation of an innovative, scalable approach that could continue to replicate on its own in the future. In total, 19 projects were developed.\n\nPartnership with Environmental Action Germany\n\nAs climate change continues to elevate temperatures in urban areas, sensitive age groups such as children and the elderly, as well as socioeconomically disadvantaged segments, bear the brunt of these challenges. TNC and partner Environmental Action Germany (Deutsche Umwelthilfe - DUH) collaborated to understand how urban greening can address these impacts. They focused on transforming urban areas, including school campuses, into valuable ecological and climate-resilient areas that simultaneously tackle the growing issue of urban heat, lack of biodiversity and the need for more nature-based solutions in the most densely populated urban areas.\n\nTNC and DUH collaboratively created Woods 'R' Us to address the health impacts of climate change on children. This program transforms German schoolyards, typically composed of concrete-heavy open spaces with little shade and few natural elements, into green spaces rich in biodiversity, adaptive to the climate and offer shade that cleans and cools the air. The program, which also focuses on introducing students to the wonders of nature, included:\n\nWhen paired together, these pilots become a powerful, multi-pronged approach to climate change that can serve as a template for others looking to implement nature-based solutions in the future. Over the course of the five-year program, TNC gained key insights that municipalities and stakeholders can apply in their own communities:\n\nThere is a gap between thinkers and doers: policymakers and planners often have more freedom to innovate, while those implementing and maintaining work face more constraints, leading to bottlenecks for new nature-based solutions.\n\nSecuring political backing is crucial, and science and research can help underpin effective policy and decision-making.\n\nInnovation funds, which can be replicated in other municipalities, face the challenge of securing necessary funding.\n\nEngagement from NGOs and the third sector is essential. They can close the gap by supporting public sector work, advocating for policy changes, facilitating experimentation, partnering with the private sector to change business practices, and helping bridge divides.\n\nBerlin’s Mierendorff Island Climate Adaptation Greenprint",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has boasted about strengthening the US economy since returning to the Oval Office. Meanwhile, millions of Americans say they're struggling to afford food, rent, and other basic necessities.\n\nGary Cohn, Trump's former chief economic advisor, said both these realities are true right now in America.\n\n\"If you look at gross domestic product, which is the overall output of the US economy, we're trending about 5% right now, which is a very high growth rate in the United States,\" Cohn said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nCohn, who is now IBM's vice chairman, also cited promising trends in inflation and unemployment rates.\n\nHowever, those numbers don't give the whole picture.\n\n\"That said, we've got an interesting economy,\" Cohn said. \"We have a massive wealth effect at the top end, and we have got hardworking Americans having a very difficult time paying their bills, and they are suffering in this economy.\"\n\nThat's why, Cohn said, the Trump administration is making affordability a key issue going forward.\n\n\"The White House is going on the offensive. The president is going to spend time out on the road talking about affordability,\" Cohn said. \"Affordability will be the issue between now and the mid-term elections.\"\n\nThe widening gap between wealthy and lower-income Americans is often described as a \"K-shaped economy.\" That's when people at the top see profound economic growth, while those at the bottom, who are more sensitive to economic shifts, face financial stress. Some economists have cautioned that a K-shaped economy portends bad days ahead.\n\n\"A silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,\" Gregory Daco, a chief economist at EY, said in a recent LinkedIn post. \"Slower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median, and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.\"\n\nThe chief economist of RSM, Joe Brusuelas, said in a recent briefing that the US would need to undergo policy shifts to reshape the economy, but that likely won't happen in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" he said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"",

    "description": "A lifelong skier shares how teaching her husband and kids to ski took years of effort, frustration, and patience before it paid off.",
    "fullText": "I grew up skiing. As in, we lived in the mountains and skied every weekend of winter, kind of thing.\n\nAt one point, early in our relationship, my husband looked at me, semi-astonished: \"I think you're better on skis than feet.\" So it was reaaaally important to me that, first, my then fiancé (now husband) and I could share this amazing sport together, and second, that when my kids were old enough, they too would know the awkward joys of being thrown off a J-bar.\n\nBut before we could cruise the groomers as a family, we had to get through many painful winters learning to ski.\n\nI thought I could teach my husband. The problem was that what comes naturally to someone who's been doing it all her life is really hard to put into words for someone who, well, grew up in urban Chicago.\n\nBut we tried! We rented skis and hit the bunny hills, specifically at a small Midwest ski resort called \"Alpine Valley.\" What could go wrong?\n\nMy husband is athletic and approached skiing with the confidence of someone who is good at every sport he tries. Until he skied. As we crested the ridge of the first hill, it all happened in a millisecond.\n\nUnable to put my weak \"pizza pie!\" lessons into action, he immediately spun wildly out of control, barreling straight down the mountain, one ski and one pole in the air, screaming \"stop, stop, stop!\" until he eventually did, hitting a fluorescent orange snowmaking turbine with such force that it slowly whirred to life. By the time I got to him, he was already throwing his skis over his shoulders and walking. \"You know how you don't play basketball?\" He screamed at me. \"Maybe I just don't ski!\"\n\nNot the best start to our alpine life together.\n\nWe needed a few no-ski winters after that one. But eventually, we tried again, this time with calculated professional intervention. We headed to our home mountain (Sunapee) and enlisted the help of a calm, 65-year-old pro with lovely, encouraging-grandpa vibes. As the pair clomped into the lodge at the end of a long Saturday, they were both beaming. \"He can ski!\" said the instructor.\n\nKids, it turns out, are much harder (and more expensive) to offload. My strategy with them was to put in sheer hours on the hill. The only way out is through, kind of thing. Sacrificing gorgeous bluebird ski days and many, many hundreds of dollars' worth of adult lift tickets to cold, crabby ingrates between my skis.\n\nEventually, they got the hang of it. And eventually, I got my ski-family wish.\n\nThat first cruiser we did as a full family — it was bliss. Big wedge turns, ear-to-ear smiles, singing at the top of their lungs. Truly, all is worth it. Now my husband skis as well as I do, and both kids leave us in the dust. But that's the way of the world.",

    "description": "Europe fears it can't beat Russia's style of war — creating a golden opportunity for defense founders.",
    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million to license the documentary and an additional docuseries on Prime Video. Brett Ratner, known for the \"Rush Hour\" franchise before sexual misconduct allegations derailed his career in 2017, directed the documentary.\n\n\"With exclusive footage of critical meetings, private conversations, and never-before-seen environments, 'Melania' showcases Mrs. Trump's return to one of the world's most powerful roles,\" an Amazon press release said.\n\nDespite the early box-office sales, the film has earned less-than-stellar reviews from critics and was review-bombed on Letterboxd. Business Insider's Peter Kafka described the documentary as \"dull,\" but said that it could resonate with superfans of the Trump family.\n\n\"The best way I can describe this one is something akin to a wedding video: Maybe the subjects of the video will want to watch it (Melania looks, unsurprisingly, like a woman who used to be a model; her husband seems notably more spry than he does now, a year after it was filmed),\" Kafka wrote. \"It's hard to imagine anyone else will.\"",

    "description": "\"I should spend more time at home, but there's so much to see and do and people to meet that I have a hard time staying home,\" Bill Strayer said.",
    "fullText": "When Bill Strayer first dreamed about moving to Asia, Japan was always the goal.\n\nBorn in Colorado, Strayer went to college in Missouri and later moved to the Bay Area to work in tech. There, work trips across Asia introduced him to cultures he hadn't encountered growing up.\n\nAs an adult, he participated in a homestay program in Japan three times, living with local families.\n\n\"That's what really kicked me into gear for being in Japan,\" Strayer, 63, told Business Insider. \"I studied Japanese, I watched Japanese movies, I listened to Japanese music. I made 14 trips to Japan.\"\n\nAs his career evolved, Strayer accepted a role at a financial services company that eventually brought him to Hawaii.\n\n\"My company had a branch office in Honolulu. I thought, well, Honolulu is kind of on the way to Japan. I'll just stay in Hawaii for two, three years and then eventually make it to Japan,\" Strayer said.\n\nWhat was meant to be a brief stop in Hawaii turned into 24 years, and the move to Japan never materialized.\n\nInstead, Strayer left his job as a portfolio advisor after a few years and eventually started a new chapter in aviation, first flying cargo and later transporting hotel guests between Hawaiian islands.\n\nAnd when it finally came time for him to retire, he moved to Bangkok instead.\n\nWhile Strayer was living in Hawaii, the timing never seemed right for a move to Japan — in his 30s, retirement still felt far off. And his mother had moved to Hawaii full time after years of being a snowbird.\n\nA two-week vacation through Southeast Asia in the early 2000s shifted his attention away from Japan. With just a day and a half in Bangkok, Thailand's capital, he hired a driver to show him around — and fell in love with the city immediately.\n\n\"This is so awesome,\" Strayer said, recalling his reaction. \"So I said, OK, next year I'm spending the whole two weeks in Bangkok. That's what kicked it off.\"\n\nEvery year after that, he would spend his two weeks of vacation in Thailand, learning more about the culture and its people. Over time, a realization set in: Japan was a place he loved to visit, but Thailand felt like somewhere he could actually live, especially since he wasn't a fan of cold weather.\n\n\"There's an extra point for Thailand; I'm not going to see a flake of snow,\" he said.\n\nAfter his mother died in 2021, Strayer decided to move forward with his plans. \"There was no real reason for me to be in Hawaii anymore,\" he said.\n\nAfter retiring from his aviation job in October 2022 and applying for a retirement visa, he returned to Bangkok in May 2023.\n\nStrayer is part of a wider trend of people relocating to Thailand. Bangkok, in particular, has long been a hot spot for expats.\n\nThere were 102,189 foreigners living in the city at the end of 2024, according to the latest Thai government data.\n\nStrayer spent two weeks living in a hotel while looking for an apartment. With the help of a real estate agent, he found a two-bedroom condo about 20 minutes from the city center. Rent is 30,000 Thai baht monthly, or about $950, and he is now in his third year there.\n\nHis furnished apartment is close to the Bangkok Skytrain, making it easy for him to get around.\n\nWith a city so accessible, Strayer has found no shortage of things to do. A typical day starts with a light breakfast, followed by a workout at his apartment complex, before heading out for lunch.\n\n\"I don't cook, because there's so much wonderful food out there on my doorstep that is inexpensive and delicious, far better than I could ever do,\" he said.\n\nA self-described foodie, he enjoys exploring new restaurants, and much of his social circle has grown out of those visits. One of his go-to spots is a small, traditional Thai restaurant that serves home-style dishes.\n\n\"I know the staff, they know me. Sometimes we get together outside of their work and stuff like that. That's been fantastic,\" Strayer said.\n\nMany of his days end with a visit to one of Bangkok's sky bars, where he watches the sunset.\n\n\"I've made it a mission to try to visit as many as I can,\" he said. \"No need to drink alcohol or anything like that, but just go ahead and hang out.\"\n\nEven in retirement, Strayer hasn't fully slowed down. He's been trading the US stock market since the 1990s and still wakes up between 2 and 4 a.m. to do it.\n\nHe's also built a small circle of expat friends in the city, including a Canadian retiree he met at the gym and another he connected with through YouTube, bonded by a shared interest in the stock market.\n\n\"I should spend more time at home, but there's so much to see and do and people to meet that I have a hard time staying home,\" Strayer added.\n\nHe continues to travel between Bangkok and Honolulu about three times a year, mostly to visit friends. But he doesn't see himself returning to Hawaii permanently — at least not for now.\n\n\"I would not have this much fun in the US. I can tell you that right now,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city? Contact this reporter at agoh@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policymakers debated mounting price pressures from a weak yen, with some warning of the risk of being \"behind the curve\" in dealing with too-high inflation, a summary of opinions at their January meeting showed on Monday.\n\n\"If overseas interest rate environments change this year, there is a risk that the bank may unintentionally fall behind the curve,\" one member was quoted as saying, calling for the need to keep pulling Japan’s real interest rates out of negative territory.\n\nWhile the risk of the BOJ falling behind the curve has not necessarily become evident, it is becoming more important to raise rates in a timely fashion, another opinion said.\n\nAt the January 22-23 meeting, the BOJ kept interest rates steady at 0.75%, having just hiked borrowing costs to the level in December. But the central bank retained its hawkish inflation forecasts and signaled readiness to keep raising still-low borrowing costs.",

    "description": "Set up automatic API key rotation for OpenRouter using Infisical. Complete guide for secure key management and zero-downtime rotation.",
    "fullText": "Infisical is a secrets management platform that helps teams securely store, sync, and rotate secrets across their infrastructure. With Infisical’s OpenRouter integration, you can automatically rotate your API keys on a schedule, ensuring your credentials stay secure with zero-downtime rotation.\n\nBefore setting up API key rotation, you’ll need an OpenRouter Provisioning API key. Provisioning keys are special keys used only for key management operations (create, list, delete keys) and cannot be used for model completion requests.\n\nNavigate to OpenRouter Settings and go to the Provisioning API Keys section. Click Create New Key, complete the key creation flow, and copy the generated Provisioning API key. Store it securely as you’ll need it when creating the Infisical connection.\n\nThe first step is to create an OpenRouter connection in Infisical that will be used to manage your API keys.\n\nIn your Infisical dashboard, navigate to Organization Settings and then App Connections (or the App Connections page in your project). Click Add Connection and choose OpenRouter from the list of available connections.\n\nComplete the form with your OpenRouter Provisioning API Key from the previous step, an optional description, and a name for the connection (for example, “openrouter-production”). After clicking Create, Infisical validates the key against OpenRouter’s API and your connection is ready to use.\n\nFor detailed instructions with screenshots, see Infisical’s OpenRouter Connection documentation.\n\nOnce your connection is set up, you can configure automatic API key rotation.\n\nNavigate to your Secret Manager Project’s Dashboard in Infisical and select Add Secret Rotation from the actions dropdown. Choose the OpenRouter API Key option.\n\nSet up how and when your keys should rotate:\n\nAuto-Rotation Enabled controls whether keys rotate automatically on the interval. Turn this off to rotate only manually or to pause rotation temporarily.\n\nRotate At specifies the local time of day when rotation runs once the interval has elapsed.\n\nRotation Interval sets the interval in days after which a rotation is triggered.\n\nOpenRouter Connection selects the connection (with a Provisioning API key) that will create and delete API keys during rotation.\n\nConfigure the properties of the rotated API keys:\n\nKey name is the display name for the key in OpenRouter (required).\n\nLimit sets an optional spending limit in USD for this key.\n\nLimit reset determines how often the limit resets: daily, weekly, or monthly.\n\nInclude BYOK in limit is an optional setting that controls whether usage from your own provider keys (Bring Your Own Key) counts toward this key’s spending limit. When disabled, only OpenRouter credits are counted. When enabled, BYOK usage is included in the limit.\n\nSpecify the secret name where the rotated API key will be stored. This is the name of the secret in Infisical where the rotated API key value will be accessible.\n\nGive your rotation a name and optional description, then review your configuration and click Create Secret Rotation. Your OpenRouter API Key rotation is now active. The current API key is available as a secret at the mapped path, and rotations will create a new key, switch the active secret to it, then revoke the previous key for zero-downtime rotation.\n\nFor the complete API reference and additional options, see Infisical’s OpenRouter API Key Rotation documentation.\n\nBYOK (Bring Your Own Key) on OpenRouter lets you use your own provider API keys (such as OpenAI or Anthropic) so you pay providers directly while OpenRouter charges a small fee on those requests.\n\nThe Include BYOK in limit option controls whether BYOK usage counts toward your key’s spending limit. When disabled, only OpenRouter credit usage counts toward the limit and BYOK usage is tracked separately. When enabled, usage from your own provider keys is included in the limit, and once the limit is reached, the key is subject to OpenRouter’s rate limits until the next reset.",

    "fullText": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock futures edged lower on Sunday evening as investors turned cautious ahead of a packed week of corporate earnings and economic data, following a pullback in technology shares that was triggered by Microsoft’s results last week.\n\nS&P 500 Futures inched 0.2% lower to 6,955.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.3% to 25,607.75 points by 19:36 ET (01:36 GMT). Dow Jones Futures traded 0.1% lower at 48,984.0 points.\n\nU.S. equities ended last week in the red, with the NASDAQ Composite leading losses as investors reassessed lofty expectations around artificial intelligence spending and returns.\n\nSentiment was dented after Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings update last week, which, while showing continued revenue growth, failed to fully reassure markets about the near-term payoff from heavy investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nThe results weighed on broader technology stocks and revived concerns that big-ticket AI spending may take longer to translate into profits.\n\nAmplifying concerns, a Wall Street Journal report over the weekend said that Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) proposed investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI has stalled after internal concerns were raised at the chipmaker\n\nAttention now shifts to earnings from other megacap technology firms, which are expected further shape market direction. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is due to report results on Tuesday, with investors closely watching advertising trends, cloud growth, and commentary on AI-related capital expenditure.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will follow on Thursday, with focus on performance at its Amazon Web Services cloud unit and margins in its core retail business.\n\nBeyond earnings, markets are also digesting political and policy developments. President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh as his nominee for Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nInvestors are weighing what a Warsh-led Fed could mean for interest rates, inflation control, and the balance between growth and financial stability, at a time when markets remain sensitive to policy signals.\n\nEconomic data later in the week could further influence rate expectations. The U.S. January employment report, due on Friday, is expected to show steady job growth and a stable unemployment rate.",

    "description": "Researchers have discovered a hidden quantum geometry inside materials that subtly steers electrons, echoing how gravity warps light in space. Once thought to exist only on paper, this effect has now been observed experimentally in a popular quantum material. The finding reveals a new way to understand and control how materials conduct electricity and interact with light. It could help power future ultra-fast electronics and quantum technologies.",
    "fullText": "How can information move at incredible speeds, or electricity flow without wasting energy? Answering these questions has pushed scientists and technology companies toward quantum materials, whose behavior is governed by physics at the smallest scales. Building these advanced materials depends on understanding how atoms and electrons behave, an area where many mysteries remain.\n\nNow, researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), working with colleagues at the University of Salerno and the CNR-SPIN Institute (Italy), have made a significant breakthrough. They identified a previously unseen geometric feature inside a quantum material that alters how electrons move, in a way similar to how gravity bends light. The findings, published in Science, point to new possibilities for next-generation quantum electronics.\n\nModern technologies rely on materials with extraordinary performance, many of which arise from quantum physics. This field focuses on matter at microscopic scales, where particles behave in surprising ways. Over the past century, research into atoms, electrons, and photons led to the invention of transistors and the foundation of today's computers.\n\nEven now, scientists continue to uncover quantum effects that challenge established theories. Recent research suggests that when huge numbers of particles interact inside certain materials, a kind of internal geometry can emerge. This structure can redirect electron motion, closely resembling how Einstein's theory of gravity describes the bending of light.\n\nFrom Mathematical Idea to Measured Reality\n\nThis internal structure is known as the quantum metric. It describes the curvature of the quantum space through which electrons travel and influences many microscopic properties of materials. Despite its importance, proving its existence experimentally has been extremely difficult.\n\n''The concept of quantum metric dates back about 20 years, but for a long time it was regarded purely as a theoretical construct. Only in recent years have scientists begun to explore its tangible effects on the properties of matter,'' explains Andrea Caviglia, full professor and director of the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science.\n\nDetecting a Hidden Geometry in Quantum Materials\n\nIn the new study, the research team led by UNIGE, together with Carmine Ortix, associate professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Salerno, detected the quantum metric at the boundary between two oxide materials, strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate. This interface is already known as a powerful platform for studying quantum behavior.\n\n''Its presence can be revealed by observing how electron trajectories are distorted under the combined influence of quantum metric and intense magnetic fields applied to solids,'' explains Giacomo Sala, research associate in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and lead author of the study.\n\nImplications for Future Technologies\n\nBeing able to observe this effect allows scientists to measure a material's optical, electronic, and transport properties more accurately. The team also found that the quantum metric is a fundamental characteristic of many materials, rather than a rare exception as previously believed.\n\n''These discoveries open up new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum geometry in a wide range of materials, with major implications for future electronics operating at terahertz frequencies (a trillion hertz), as well as for superconductivity and light-matter interactions,'' concludes Andrea Caviglia.\n\nMaterials provided by Université de Genève.

    "fullText": "Second T20 international, Pallekele\n\nSri Lanka 189-5 (20.0 overs): Rathnayake 40 (22); Archer 2-42, Jacks 1-24\n\nEngland 173-4 (16.4 overs): Banton 54* (33), Buttler 39 (29); Pathirana 2-47\n\nEngland won by six wickets runs; lead three-match series 2-0\n\nTom Banton whacked an unbeaten half-century as England pulled off a brilliant DLS chase to beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the second T20 international.\n\nThe players had gone off for rain with England 57-2 off 7.2 overs - Phil Salt and Jacob Bethell the batters out - and when they returned the tourists were set a revised DLS target of 168 off 17 overs.\n\nJos Buttler laid the platform with a 29-ball 39 but Harry Brook truly gave England belief during a brutal and breathtaking cameo in Pallekele.\n\nBrook spanked four sixes during a knock of 36 off 12 balls as he seized the initiative only to be caught scooping the slingy Matheesha Pathirana.\n\nWith 38 runs off 33 balls required, Banton played with calculated aggression en route to 54 not out off 33 balls to put England on the brink of victory.\n\nThe match went down to the final over but Sam Curran duly cracked Janith Liyanage for six to wrap up the win with two balls to spare.\n\nSri Lanka had earlier posted a competitive 189-5 after being inserted by England as Pavan Rathnayake top scored with 40 off 22 balls.\n\nPathum Nissanka had set the tone after he and fellow opener Kamil Mishara hammered 35 off the first two overs of the match.\n\nHowever, England's spinners stymied the hosts' attacking intent with controlled spells through the middle overs as Adil Rashid, Liam Dawson and Will Jacks all picked up a wicket apiece.\n\nJofra Archer claimed 2-42 but fellow seamers Jamie Overton and Curran were both expensive and wicketless.\n\nEngland's victory ensured they clinched the series 2-0 with one match left to play before their opening game of the T20 World Cup against Nepal on 8 February.\n\nBanton burst on to the international scene for England in 2019 with some eye-catching performances as a 21-year-old.\n\nA blur of flamboyant strokeplay and powerful ball striking, he was perhaps found wanting when it came to consistency, especially in his previous guise opening.\n\nThere were question marks as to whether he could hack it when under pressure while injuries also checked his progress.\n\nAt the age of 27, and in England's middle order, the Somerset man looks a much more rounded player at home on the global stage.\n\nThis was an innings of tempered aggression and one which was the glue that bound England's chase together.\n\nBanton swept and reverse swept quite beautifully against Sri Lanka's spinners, striking four fours and three sixes.\n\nHe also knew when to play second fiddle - while Brook was going berserk, for example - which showed useful situational awareness.\n\n\"You've got to give yourself a chance to get out there and assess the wicket,\" Banton said at the post-match presentation.\n\n\"Where there's a bit of hold and turn, it's essential to be able to sweep the ball. The Sri Lankan spinners keep it nice and straight so you've got to hit it.\"\n\nHis chance here came courtesy of Ben Duckett nursing a finger injury and England will now have a decision to make for the World Cup.\n\nAnother decent outing in the final T20 on Tuesday and it could be Banton's place in the middle to lose.\n\n\"I think most of my career I've been opening. I've got a new role with England which is exciting,\" Banton added.\n\n\"I just want to try and play all formats and hopefully take my chance when I get it.\"\n\nEncouragingly for England on the eve of a subcontinental T20 World Cup, their spin department is holding up well.\n\nA combined 12 overs yielded three wickets for 81 runs at an economy rate of 6.75, a return that underlined their growing control and reliability.\n\nRashid remains the ace in the pack, capable of stifling momentum and producing breakthroughs at key moments.\n\nThe experienced leg-spinner's googly may have been well studied by opposition batters, but it remains a potent weapon, as Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka discovered when he was trapped lbw slogging to leg.\n\nDawson's left-arm spin provided much-needed control through the middle overs, slowing down his speeds to left vs right handers, while Jacks continues to mature as a bowling option, and used his angles well.\n\nBrook has plenty of options to turn to even when the pitch does not spin big.\n\nA slight concern for England, with just under a week to go before a major tournament, was that their seam bowling did not quite hit the mark.\n\nThat caveat comes with the acknowledgement that the surface at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium was a used one, offering little margin for error.\n\nNevertheless Jamie Overton struggled with his length, while Curran, fresh from an expensive hat-trick in the opening T20, surprisingly lacked conviction after conceding 14 from his first over.\n\nArcher fared slightly better, picking up two wickets despite being targeted early on, with Nissanka launching him out of the ground in his opening over.\n\nArcher, however, recovered well to bowl effectively at the death as Sri Lanka pushed for a total in excess of 200.\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"I thought we played outstanding there, especially with the bat. To win the series is awesome.\n\n\"I think the more time we get out in the middle puts us into good shape for the World Cup. The way Banton played there was great. There's plenty of batters in there. We just go out there and chase.\n\n\"The spinners have been awesome, that's why we decided to pick two frontline spinners, to help restrict those runs in the middle.\"\n\nSri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka: \"We did a lot of things right. It's not the rain, but the fact that Eshan Malinga got injured played a part. Normally he's a very good death bowler but we lost him so there's a reason [for the loss].\n\n\"Every batter got starts so happy about the way they played and accelerated. There were a few overs where we couldn't capitalise but Adil Rashid bowled well.\n\n\"We know that because we've played on spin tracks the past two years. It's the home advantage so no doubt about it we need to use that.\"\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "Yann LeCun, an A.I. Pioneer, Warns the Tech 'Herd' Could Hit a Dead End",
    "description": "Yann LeCun helped create the technology behind today’s chatbots. Now he says many tech companies are on the wrong path to creating intelligent machines.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his 40-year career as a computer scientist, Yann LeCun has earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and a man with a penchant for throwing verbal grenades.\n\nHe was one of three pioneering researchers who received the Turing Award, often called “the Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on the technology that is now the foundation for modern A.I. For more than a decade, he also served as chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut after leaving Meta in November, Dr. LeCun has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Silicon Valley’s single-minded approach to building intelligent machines. He argues that the technology industry will eventually hit a dead end in its A.I. development — after years of work and hundreds of billions of dollars spent.\n\nThe reason, he said, goes back to what he has argued for years: Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the A.I. technology at the heart of popular products like ChatGPT, can get only so powerful. And companies are throwing everything they have at projects that won’t get them to their goal to make computers as smart as or even smarter than humans. More creative Chinese companies, he added, could get there first.\n\n“There is this herd effect where everyone in Silicon Valley has to work on the same thing,” he said during a recent interview from his home in Paris. “It does not leave much room for other approaches that may be much more promising in the long term.”\n\nThat critique is the latest shot in a debate that has roiled the tech industry since OpenAI sparked the A.I. boom in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT: Is it possible to create so-called artificial general intelligence or even more powerful superintelligence? And can companies get there using their current technology and concepts?\n\nFew scientists have as much history with the topic as Dr. LeCun, 65. Much of what the tech industry is trying to do now has its roots in an idea that he has nurtured since the 1970s. As a young engineering student in Paris, he embraced a concept called neural networks, even though most researchers thought the idea was hopeless.\n\nNeural networks are mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. At the time, they had no practical use. But a decade later, when he was a researcher at Bell Labs, Dr. LeCun and his colleagues showed that these systems could learn to read handwriting scribbled on envelopes or personal checks.\n\nNot long after ChatGPT was released, the two researchers who received the 2018 Turing Award with Dr. LeCun warned that A.I. was growing too powerful. Those scientists even warned that the technology could threaten the future of humanity. Dr. LeCun argued that was absurd.\n\n“There was a lot of noise around the idea that A.I. systems were intrinsically dangerous and that putting them in the hands of everyone was a mistake,” he said. “But I have never believed in this.”\n\nDr. LeCun also helped push Meta and its rivals to freely share their research through academic-style papers and so-called open source technologies.\n\nAs more people said A.I. could be a threat of some sort to humans, a number of companies curtailed their open source efforts. But Meta kept going. Dr. LeCun repeatedly argued that open source was the safest path. It meant that no one company would control the technology and that anyone could use these systems to identify and fight potential risks.\n\nNow as a number of companies, including Meta, appear to be moving away from that method because they want an edge over their rivals and continue to worry about dangerous uses, Dr. LeCun is warning that American companies could lose their lead to Chinese rivals that are still using open source.\n\n“This is a disaster,” he said. “If everyone is open, the field as a whole progresses faster.”\n\nMeta’s A.I. work ran into a snag last year. After outside researchers criticized the company’s latest technology, Llama 4, and accused Meta of misrepresenting the power of the system, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, spent billions on a new research lab dedicated to the pursuit of “superintelligence” — a hypothetical A.I. system that exceeds the powers of the human brain.\n\nSix months after the creation of the new lab, Dr. LeCun left Meta to build his own start-up, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, or AMI Labs.\n\nEven though his research laid the groundwork for L.L.M.s, Dr. LeCun argued that they were not the final answer to A.I. development. The problem with current systems, he said, is that they do not plan ahead. Trained solely on digital data, they do not have a way of understanding difficulties in the real world.\n\n“L.L.M.s are not a path to superintelligence or even human-level intelligence. I have said that from the beginning,” he said. “The entire industry has been L.L.M.-pilled.”\n\nDuring his last several years at Meta, Dr. LeCun worked on technology that tried to predict the outcome of its actions. That, he said, would allow A.I. to progress beyond the status quo. His new start-up will continue that work.\n\n“This type of system can plan what it is going to do,” he said. “Current systems — L.L.M.s — absolutely cannot do that.”\n\nPart of Dr. LeCun’s argument is that today’s A.I. systems make too many mistakes. As they tackle more complex tasks, he argued, mistakes pile up like cars after a collision on a highway.\n\nBut over the last several years, these systems have steadily improved. And in recent months, the latest models, which are designed to “reason” through questions, have continued to improve in areas like math, science and computer programming.\n\n“These models do make mistakes. But we have shown that a system can try many different options — in its own head, so to speak — before settling on a final answer,” said Rayan Krishnan, the chief executive of Vals AI, a company that tracks the performance of the latest A.I. technologies.\n\n“Progress is not slowing down. It has become clear that language models can take on new tasks and continue to get better at doing everything we want them to do,” he said.\n\nSubbarao Kambhampati, an Arizona State University professor who has been an A.I. researcher nearly as long as Dr. LeCun, agreed that today’s technologies don’t provide a path to true intelligence. But he also pointed out that they were increasingly useful in highly lucrative areas like computer coding. Dr. LeCun’s newer methods, he added, are unproven.\n\nFor Dr. LeCun, that is why his new company is important. The last several decades, he said, are filled with A.I. projects that seemed like a way forward but ran out of steam. And Silicon Valley is not guaranteed to be the winner in this global race.\n\n“The good ideas are coming from China,” he said. “But Silicon Valley also has a superiority complex, so it can’t imagine that good ideas can come from other places.”",

Of the traditional big six, only Manchester City and Tottenham have been active, spending £84m and £48m respectively.\n\nIndeed, Antoine Semenyo's £63m switch from Bournemouth to City looks set to be comfortably the biggest deal done in the window.\n\nCity will be the biggest spenders for the second-consecutive January, having spent £188m 12 months ago on reinforcements that have had varying degrees of impact on the first-team. The £84m outlay on Semenyo and Marc Guehi edges them close to an eye-watering £450m spend in the last 12-month period.\n\nTottenham (£47.8m) and West Ham (£47m) follow next, the latter adding two centre-forwards to their ranks as they look to move out of the relegation zone.\n\nLiverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea have so far chosen to sit this one out, and that's been a prevailing theme for that quartet in January of late; Arsenal and Liverpool have not signed anyone at all in winter for three seasons now, while United's capture of Patrick Dorgu (£27m in 2025) has been their only business over that same period.\n\nChelsea signed Mathis Amougou (£13.5m) last January, otherwise they have transitioned to relying solely on summer business, too.",

Michael Carrick's post-match assessment summed up the view of many.\n\nBenjamin Sesko is entitled to the headlines after delivering the dramatic ending.\n\nBut when the dust settles on the 3-2 win over Fulham, United fans may start to look back further to Ruben Amorim's ill-fated 14 months in charge and wonder whether their club effectively wasted a year.\n\nAmorim presided over victories like this.\n\nThe 5-4 epic against Lyon in the Europa League last April was even more dramatic given it involved two goals in the final minute of extra time.\n\nGo back further and Carrick played in them. He was an injury-time substitute before Michael Owen scored his famous Manchester derby winner at Old Trafford in 2009.\n\n\"It's the best feeling,\" said Carrick.\n\n\"Some of the best moments here I've been lucky enough to be a part of, when you get a moment of elation and excitement like that.\n\n\"There's no better place, in front of the Stretford End - and it ends up meaning a bit more.\n\n\"People leave here with more than just a United win.

    "description": "Plus, how to whip up the best morning meal for your gut.",
    "fullText": "All of our meals and snacks affect our health on a short-term basis. When eaten regularly, they also impact our bodies (for better or worse) down the line. However, one gastroenterologist has a special love of breakfast, especially when it comes to his patients' gut health and his own.\n\n\"Think of your breakfast as the opening act for your gut's entire day,\" shares Dr. Rosario Ligresti, MD, the chief ofthe division of gastroenterology at Hackensack University Medical Center. \"What you eat first thing in the morning sets the stage for your digestive system's rhythm and your gut microbiome's activity.\"\n\nDr. Ligresti says well-balanced breakfasts stabilize blood sugar levels, prevent energy crashes and lower the odds that you'll get a hankering for less nutritious, sugary snacks later. Speaking of later, we're not fans of potty talk at the breakfast table. That said, good breakfast habits can lead to good bathroom habits, so you're less likely to get constipated.\n\n\"Essentially, a good breakfast habit tells your gut, 'We're starting the day strong and nourished,' which can lead to better energy, focus and overall digestive wellness throughout the day,\" he explains.\n\nWhat qualifies as a good breakfast, though? To help, Dr. Ligresti shares the one breakfast mistake he wishes people would stop making and delicious ways to break the habit.\n\n🩺\nDr. Ligresti wishes people would stop skipping or deprioritizing fiber and protein in the morning. \"Protein and fiber are the power couple of a gut-healthy breakfast, and I can't recommend them enough,\" he tells Parade.\n\nIndeed, fiber is getting billed as the new protein these days. However, trend forecasters can take a seat because there's plenty of room for both fiber and protein at the breakfast table. Unfortunately, many sugary cereals and other traditional breakfast foods are low in both of these nutrients, and that's a problem.\n\nLet's start with fiber. It's not a standalone macro nutrient like protein is, though complex carbohydrates like whole-wheat breads and pastas contain fiber. Regardless, fiber can have a macro effect on your overall health, especially your digestive tract. Fewer than 10% of Americans get enough fiber daily, though, and it's not doing their guts any good.\n\n\"When you consume fiber, it acts like a broom for your digestive tract, adding bulk to your stool, which helps with regularity and prevents constipation,\" Dr. Ligresti explains. \"Furthermore, certain fibers are prebiotics, meaning they are food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut, helping to create a diverse and thriving gut microbiome.\"\n\nWhether the spotlight on protein is on dimming remains to be seen. However, he hopes that people continue to prioritize the macronutrient every morning. \"Protein, on the other hand, is crucial for making you feel full and satisfied, which helps to curb overeating later in the day.\"\n\nIn short? Protein and fiber are not rivals. They are two of your gut's best friends.\n\n\"Having these two nutrients together at breakfast provides you with sustained energy, supports muscle health, and keeps your blood sugar stable for hours,\" Dr. Ligresti says.\n\nSpeaking of hours, they're at the heart of why many people don't get enough fiber and protein at breakfast. There simply aren't enough of them in the day. \"In our fast-paced lives, time is often the biggest reason people skip a nutrient-dense breakfast,\" he states. \"It's much quicker to grab a pastry, a sugary cereal, or just a cup of coffee on the way out the door.\"\n\nAs convenient and tasty as these options are, Dr. Ligresti explains they are low in protein and fiber and high in refined sugars and unhealthy fats. \"In the short term, these foods can cause a rapid spike and subsequent crash in your blood sugar, leading to fatigue and more cravings,\" he reports. \"They can also contribute to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and gas.\"\n\nOver time, he says eating these foods at breakfast or any time of day consistently might alter your gut microbiome, potentially leading to inflammation and a greater risk of developing other chronic health issues.\n\nReady to help your gut health rise with a breakfast that consistently shines? Dr. Ligresti shares three time-saving breakfasts rich in fiber and protein.\n\nGreek yogurt with berries and nuts. This easy-to-assemble breakfast idea is a win for your schedule and gut health. \"The Greek yogurt provides a fantastic source of protein, the berries are loaded with fiber and antioxidants, and the nuts add more fiber and healthy fats for sustained energy,\" he says.\n\nOatmeal with chia seeds and an apple. You definitely don't have to ditch all of the classics, especially not oatmeal. \"Oatmeal...is rich in soluble fiber, which is great for heart health and keeping you full,\" he says. \"I like to stir in some chia seeds for an extra boost of fiber and omega-3s, and top it with sliced apples for some sweetness and crunch.\"\n\nScrambled eggs with spinach on whole-wheat toast. Savory tooths, rejoice. \"The eggs are a complete protein, and adding spinach provides extra vitamins and fiber,\" Dr. Ligresti shares. \"Serving it on a slice of whole-wheat toast ensures you're getting that essential fiber to start your day right.\"\n\nGetting enough protein and fiber is a great first step toward better gut health. However, Dr. Ligresti shares that there are other important strategies to implement to keep your gut happy. He recommends:\n\nDr. Ligresti always tells patients to sip water throughout the day to help prevent constipation and support their overall gut health. \"Water is essential for helping fiber do its job of moving things smoothly through your digestive system,\" he says.\n\n\"Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut are rich in probiotics, which are live beneficial bacteria that can help support a healthy gut microbiome,\" he explains. If you don't normally consume these foods, he suggests starting with a small serving of one of these ideas each day.\n\nHe points out that there's a strong brain-gut connection, and chronically high stress can throw things out of whack. \"High levels of stress can negatively impact your digestion,\" Dr. Ligresti says. \"I encourage my patients to find a daily stress-reducing activity they enjoy, whether it's a short walk, meditation or simply reading a book.\"\n\nDr. Rosario Ligresti, MD, the chief ofthe division of gastroenterology at Hackensack University Medical Center\n\nClosing America’s Fiber Intake Gap.

The complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a misconduct complaint filed by the Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald Trump ’s administration over deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec. 19 by Jeffrey S. Sutton, chief judge of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but the order only came to light this weekend.\n\nThe complaint stemmed from remarks that Boasberg, the chief judge in the district court in the nation’s capital, allegedly made in March 2025 to Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges at a judicial conference saying the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings. The meeting took place days before Boasberg issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.\n\nIn the dismissal order, Sutton said the Justice Department never provided a listed attachment to provide proof of what Boasberg said or the context of the alleged statement at the closed-door conference.\n\n“A recycling of unadorned allegations with no reference to a source does not corroborate them. And a repetition of uncorroborated statements rarely supplies a basis for a valid misconduct complaint,\" said Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to the appeals court circuit that covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and for Boasberg's court did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nEven if Boasberg had made the comments, Sutton said it would not be “so far afield\" from topics discussed at the gathering and would not violate ethics rules. Sutton noted that Roberts' 2024 year-end report raised general concerns about threats to judicial independence, security concerns for judges and respect for court orders throughout the nation's history.\n\nThe misconduct complaint was filed with Judge Sri Srinivasan, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but Srinivasan asked Roberts to transfer it to another appeals court circuit because it was still considering appeals related to the deportation case, according to the dismissal order. Roberts transferred it to the 6th Circuit, it said.",

    "description": "“All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food.\"",
    "fullText": "Plastic pollution is an enormous global problem, and a lot of focus has been rightly placed on the devastating effects that plastic is having on our oceans and marine life. But plastic pollution on land is a big problem, too, as experts have recently been reminded when they started discovering giant blobs of the stuff inside the stomachs of dead camels.\n\nCalifornia-based environmental scientist Marcus Eriksen and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based veterinary microbiologist Ulrich Wernery co-authored an article titled \"The plight of camels eating plastic waste.\"\n\nEriksen described one autopsy as \"the most surreal thing in the world,\" and their findings showed that plastic clumps called polybezoars, which Eriksen said \"range from the size of a basketball to roughly a large suitcase,\" are responsible for 1% of the camel deaths in the UAE\n\n\"All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food,\" Eriksen said. \"If they see a plastic bag stuck in a tree … or stuck against a fence, they might think, 'Oh, that's a novel piece of food,' and they'll consume it.\"\n\nThe effects of eating plastic are devastating for the camels, causing intestinal blockages, creating lacerations inside their stomachs, and creating a toxic environment for bacteria to grow amid the folds of the plastic.\n\n\"It's a slow death,\" Eriksen said. \"Imagine if you had five plastic bags crushed up in your body, and maybe a dozen bottle caps and a few straws, and it stayed there for years. I mean, you would suffer until you'd ultimately perish from that ingested trash. And that's what the camels are experiencing.\"\n\nCamels are not the only land animals facing this challenge, either. A sick bear in Colorado was recently euthanized and found to have plastic waste blocking its digestive system. Plastic waste consumption also killed two elephants in Sri Lanka.\n\nAs plastic waste causes more and more animal deaths, there is some hope that public pressure will cause governments to regulate it more heavily. Canada banned single-use plastics in 2021, and other places, such as Massachusetts, have taken similar steps.\n\nAs far as steps we can take to reduce our plastic consumption in our regular lives, we can make sure we understand how to recycle as effectively as possible and shun single-use plastics by using things like reusable water bottles.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s jokes at an elite closed-door Washington, D.C., event bombed so badly that “the room fell silent repeatedly,” The Washington Post reported Sunday.\n\nThe awkwardness happened Saturday night at the Alfalfa Club dinner, an invitation-only event for some 200 of the rich and powerful who gather together each year on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s birthday.\n\nAccording to The Post, it was the first time Trump addressed the club, “speaking before a room whose membership includes such foes as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (whose bank he is suing), David Rubenstein (whom he fired as head of the Kennedy Center) and Jerome H. Powell (the outgoing Fed chairman whose role he is investigating).”\n\nAn anonymous source told The Post that some of Trump’s jokes “landed with a thud, and the room fell silent repeatedly.”\n\nTrump began his remarks by declaring, “So many people in the room I hate. Most of you I like,” Trump said, before adding, “Who in the hell thought this was going to happen?”\n\nTrump then warned the crowd that he might “cut the speech short” so he could watch “the invasion of Greenland,” before revealing that he was just joking.\n\n“We’re not going to invade Greenland. We’re going to buy it,” Trump said, according to the report. “It’s never been my intention to make Greenland the 51st state. I want to make Canada the 51st state. Greenland will be the 52nd state. Venezuela can be 53rd.”\n\nTrump dropped several off-color comments about his political adversaries, according to attendees. He described calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) “Pocahontas” in reference to her claims of Native American heritage. She was supposed to be at the dinner, he said, “but couldn’t find her reservation.” He mentioned that Condoleezza Rice was also in the audience and said he always thought she would be the first female president. “Never in a million years would I have thought Joe Biden would beat her to it,” he added, suggesting that former first lady Jill Biden was the true president in a barb that also appeared to bomb with guests.\n\nAfter the event, Trump flew to his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, FL, for White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino’s wedding, scheduled to be held Sunday.\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Bombed His Speech at Closed-Door Black Tie DC Dinner: ‘Jokes Landed With a Thud’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "If someone is a millionaire, there are usually signs beyond the number in their bank account. If you are trying to get on the wealth-building path to reach millionaire status, you may need to adopt habits, values and financial strategies that represent true wealth.\n\nMoving from aspiring to having actual riches takes noticeable shifts in your behavior around money management, especially when it comes to your spending and savings habits. Identifying these ways to edit is important because they show not just where financial success is possible but also a mindset that’s focused on lasting wealth creation.\n\nSimply put, if you’re looking for clues on how to be rich, you might want to do as a millionaire does. Here are some key signs you are making the financial decisions they would.\n\nA diversified investment portfolio is a hallmark of a millionaire. This portfolio typically extends beyond stocks and bonds, toward encompassing real estate, business ventures and perhaps alternative investments like art or private equity.\n\nWhen you are saving for retirement or a big-ticket item, diversification isn’t a random act of finance. It’s a strategic approach to spread risk and maximize returns by avoiding putting all of your nest eggs in one basket.\n\nRead Next: 5 Key Mindset Shifts To Financially Become the Top 1%, According to Humphrey Yang\n\nLearn More: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nAnother key sign of a millionaire is making strategic financial planning and investment decisions. Your goal isn’t just about saving money but rather creating a comprehensive roadmap for earning, saving, investing and spending. Millionaires understand that a well-thought-out financial strategy is crucial for wealth accumulation and preservation.\n\nRobust savings and substantial emergency funds are common among millionaires. They understand the importance of having a safety net that should have at least three to six months’ worth of expenses in it to cover you should something unexpected happen, such as medical bills or job loss.\n\nUnlike the average person, a millionaire’s emergency fund can cover a year or more of living expenses, ensuring financial stability even in unforeseen circumstances.\n\nMillionaires typically have a low debt-to-income ratio. This means they are cautious about borrowing and prioritize paying off debts quickly.\n\nThough this may seem easier for those not living paycheck to paycheck, someone comfortable with their finances tends to focus on accumulating assets, not liabilities, indicating a healthy approach to debt management.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nWhen I start working with a new senior client, the first exercise I introduce to them is the wall plank.\n\nThis simple exercise is great for strengthening the deepest muscles in our core, which are responsible for supporting the back and hips, maintaining proper posture, and stabilizing the entire body.\n\nAnd because muscle mass, bone density and balance all diminish as we age, having good deep core strength is all the more important for preventing injuries and falls.\n\nThe wall plank is appropriate for all fitness levels, easy to modify or progress, and safe to do every day. As long as you have a section of bare wall and a few minutes to spare, you can give wall planks a try.\n\nCheck in with your doctor before starting any new activity. A certified trainer can provide form guidance and exercise modification, if needed.\n\nStand facing a wall, position yourself about six inches away from it with your feet hip-width apart.\n\nLean forward and place your forearms against the wall, making sure your elbows, forearms and shoulders are aligned.\n\nYour body should form a straight line from your head to your feet, don’t allow your hips to pop back or sink towards the wall.\n\nGently push the muscles in your midsection out to engage your core muscles and keep them braced throughout.\n\nHold for the desired length of time.\n\nStart by holding the wall plank for 15 seconds, incrementally working your way up to 60 seconds over subsequent workouts. Beginners should aim to do one set of wall planks two to three times a week. Once you’ve built up the appropriate amount of strength, aim for two to three sets of wall planks, five to seven times a week.\n\nMake it easier: If this exercise feels tough, modify by placing your hands against the wall instead of your elbows, or by placing your feet closer to the wall.\n\nMake it harder: Make the exercise more challenging by walking your feet further away from the wall. Once you’re able to hold the wall plank for 60 seconds with good form, consider trying the plank on a lower elevated surface, like a chair or your bed.\n\nStandard planks performed lying face down on a yoga mat are one of the best exercises to target the transverse abdominis, a deep-lying muscle in the core that stabilizes and supports your spine and pelvis.\n\nDeep core strength is especially important for seniors, because age-related changes can jeopardize overall balance and stability.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries or mobility issues can make it difficult for many seniors to do exercises on the floor. Wall planks are done standing upright instead, engaging the transverse abdominis in a similar way to standard planks.",

    "fullText": "Argentine cherry growers are facing a challenging season with severe rain and hailstorms. Production and exports have fallen due to this change in climate. The damaged crop has threatened global food supplies and farmers' livelihoods.\n\nEurofruit reported that poor weather caused Argentine cherry shipments in the last quarter of 2025 to hit a low.\n\nPlanet protection agency SENASA confirmed that cherry shipments totaled 3,760 tonnes (over 4,100 tons). This is a 38% decrease from last year and 19% below the five-year average.\n\nThe \"sector [is] on course for its worst season since 2019,\" per the report.\n\nGrowers projected good-quality crops to exceed last year's totals.\n\nAccording to Eurofruit, rain and hailstorms damaged \"the main producing areas\" instead. Much of the crop went to the domestic market.\n\nShifts in export markets are also happening in the 2025/26 season. Despite the drop in volumes, the U.S. is becoming the top destination (36%), while China's share fell (26%).\n\nBad weather in Argentine cherry production indicates how an overheating planet impacts crops. Farming communities and importing countries rely on crops for food and to support their economies.\n\nFrequent extreme weather events, which have been increasing, damage agricultural yields.

    "fullText": "(refiles to fix hyperlinks in paragraph 8, 14)\n\nDUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's leadership warned of a regional conflict on Sunday if the U.S. were to attack it, stoking the tension between Washington and Tehran, and it ​designated EU armies as \"terrorist groups\" in a retaliatory move.\n\nThe United States has ramped up its naval presence in the ‌Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.\n\nDespite the ‌standoff between Iran's clerical rulers and the Trump administration, both sides have signalled they are ready to resume talks, and regional allies such as Turkey have sought de-escalation.\n\nAn Iranian official denied an earlier report by state-run Press TV that the Revolutionary Guards' naval forces would carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday and Monday, telling Reuters they have no such plan and the media ⁠reports are wrong.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ‌was quoted on state media as saying that although Trump says he has sent ships to the region, \"the Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred ‍by these threats\".\n\n\"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them,\" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in ​the region, raising the risk of war after Iran's deadly crackdown in January on nationwide protests against Iranian leadership.\n\nTrump was weighing ‌options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces, Reuters has reported, citing multiple sources.\n\nOn Saturday Trump told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with Washington, hours after Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that arrangements for negotiations were underway.\n\nTrump also said: \"I hope they negotiate something acceptable. You could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTehran says it is ready for \"fair\" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe protests, which started over economic hardships but morphed ⁠into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its ​establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.\n\nOfficial numbers put the unrest-related death ​toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.\n\nIn a symbolic shift in response to ‍the crackdown on protests, the European ⁠Union on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn retaliation on Sunday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said EU armies would also be designated as such, and that authorities would deliberate on the expulsion of EU ⁠states' military attachés.\n\n\"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot\" the speaker told fellow lawmakers, who all wore IRGC ‌uniforms in support of the elite force.\n\nAfter his address, lawmakers shouted \"Death to America, Shame on you Europe\".",

    "description": "Warren Buffett isn't known for overcomplicating things—and when it comes to investing, he doesn't think you should either. At the 2008 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Buffett was asked, \"If you were 30 years old again and had your first million in the bank, how would you invest it assuming you're not a full-time investor, you have another full-time job, you can cover your expenses with other savings for about 18 months, and you have no dependents.\" \"I'll be very simple,\" he repli",

Buffett wasn't advising someone to watch the markets or make investing a second job. He was saying to get on with life. Keep earning. Let compound interest take the wheel. With steady income and decades ahead, the real advantage isn't perfect timing—it's not touching the money at all. When the plan is simple and automatic, the hardest part is knowing when to leave it alone.\n\nBuffett has long maintained that most investors shouldn't try to beat the market. It's not about intelligence—it's about realism. He doesn't just invest in companies—he buys entire businesses, with full access to management, operations, and long-term strategy. That's not something the average investor can replicate.\n\nInstead, he recommends simplicity and discipline. A low-cost index fund—like one that tracks the S&P 500—spreads your money across hundreds of large U.S. companies. There's no guesswork involved. You're not betting on the next Apple or Amazon. You're owning a slice of the entire market and letting it grow over time.\n\nTrending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\n\nAt Berkshire's 2020 shareholders meeting, Buffett doubled down on the same principle. \"I don't think most people are in a position to pick single stocks,\" he said. \"A few [are], maybe, but on balance, I think people are much better off buying a cross-section of America and just forgetting about it.\"",

    "fullText": "More than 5,200 members of the United Educators of San Francisco voted overwhelmingly to authorize the union’s leadership to call a strike as teachers push for more public education funding.\n\nThe union, which represents San Francisco Unified School District workers such as educators, nurses, counselors, and psychologists, voted in favor by 97.6% to pave the way for a potential strike.\n\n“Our community is standing with us in our fight for the consistent classroom teachers, special education supports, and stable programs our students and families need and deserve,” UESF wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.\n\nThe post said the school district was placing money into savings accounts and contracting out work to traveling psychologists or non-district special education support staff.\n\nThe last time San Francisco educators went on strike was in 1979, according to the union. The strike lasted for seven weeks.\n\nThe union didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday via email.\n\nIn a post on Sunday, the San Francisco Unified School District's Superintendent Maria Su said they \"remain committed to negotiating in good faith with UESF and working toward an agreement that supports our students, educators, and school communities.\"\n\nA special Board of Education meeting is scheduled for Wednesday that will focus on labor negotiations, which includes a resolution that would allow the superintendent to make \"necessary operational decisions in the event of a strike,\" the post said.\n\nThe strike authorization vote came on the same day as educators in Southern California also signaled they were gearing up to head to the picket lines to demand better pay and working conditions.\n\nUnited Teachers Los Angeles members also gave their leadership authorization to call a strike.

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "Emily Beutner, the daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner, died on Jan. 6\n\nThe 22-year-old college student died at the hospital after she was found seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” by a highway in Palmdale, Calif.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said\n\nThe 22-year-old daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner has died after seemingly experiencing a medical emergency. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.\n\nEmily Beutner died on Jan. 6 after she was spotted seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” on the side of the highway in Palmdale, Calif., shortly after 12 a.m. local time, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) said in a press release obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nA witness in the area — the intersection of Sierra Highway and Technology Drive — had alerted authorities to a woman in a “state of medical distress,” Lt. Michael Modica told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe politician’s daughter was treated at the scene and transported to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, according to the LASD.\n\nLASD homicide investigators “responded and assumed control of the death investigation,” the sheriff’s department said. Speaking with the Times, however, Modica warned that this should not be taken as an indication of Emily’s cause of death, as this is typical for a young person found dead in a situation like this one.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, the cause of death has not yet been determined, with Emily’s case remaining open, according to Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office records viewed by PEOPLE.\n\nAustin shared a statement with the Times in the wake of his daughter’s death.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said. “We ask for privacy and your prayers at this time.”\n\nEmily is one of four adult children Austin shares with his wife, Virginia, according to his campaign website. She was a junior at Loyola Marymount University (LMU), where she was studying studio arts, according to a statement shared by the university in the wake of her death.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“Please join me in extending our deepest condolences to Emily’s family and loved ones, and in holding Emily and all who are grieving her loss in our collective thoughts and prayers,” said LMU President Thomas Poon.\n\nPoon also said that the L.A.-based private university will honor Emily with a plaque at its student memorial.\n\nAustin’s opponent in the mayoral race, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, also issued a statement following Emily’s death.\n\n“I am profoundly saddened by the news of the tragic passing of Austin Beutner’s daughter,” Bass said. “There is no way to describe the depth of pain experienced by parents who have lost a child. My heart is broken for the Beutner family, and I offer Austin, his wife Virginia, and their entire family my deepest condolences.\"\n\n\"I will hold them close in my heart,” the mayor’s statement continued, “and I am ready to assist the family with whatever they might need.”",
