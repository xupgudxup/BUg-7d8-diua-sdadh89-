    "description": "Colorful, successful, beloved, Holtz always knew what to say — and how to say it.",
    "fullText": "Lou Holtz is on the ropes, but this modern-day Will Rogers has a legacy that will endure the ages.\n\nHoltz, 89, is reported to be in hospice as his health has declined in recent weeks. He has been an iconic voice for college football, sports in general and life specifically.\n\nI remember him delivering one-liners at a bowl game luncheon that BYU was involved in, and he didn’t disappoint.\n\nA former coach at Notre Dame, who won a national championship during his 11 seasons in South Bend, he commanded hefty fees for speaking engagements and appearances, and he never failed to deliver or inspire.\n\nThe players dinner for the United States Golf Association’s 2014 Mid-Amateur in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is a perfect example of how the 2008 College Football Hall of Fame inductee delivered his wisdom with humility, candor and humor.\n\nHoltz told the field of 264 players, narrowed from a group of 3,891, they’d maneuvered a great challenge, “But if what you did yesterday looks good to you, then you haven’t done much today. That’s why the good Lord put eyes in front of you, not in back of you.”\n\nHere are some of my favorite quotes from Hotlz over the years:\n\n— Greg Flugaur (@flugempire) January 30, 2026\n\n“Don’t complicate it. Do you realize there are only five colors in a rainbow? That’s all, five. Think what Michelangelo did with those five colors. There are only seven musical notes. Seven! Look at what Beethoven did with those seven musical notes. So, I try to keep life simple.”\n\n“I don’t understand how a black cow eats green grass and produces white milk. I don’t understand why they sell hotdogs in packages of six and hot dog buns in packages of eight. I don’t understand why a kamikaze pilot wore a helmet.”\n\nHoltz is the only coach to lead six different teams (William & Mary, North Carolina State, Arkansas, Minnesota, Notre Dame and South Carolina) to bowl games and four teams to final top-20 rankings. He knows pressure. And here’s what he said about it.\n\n“Pressure to me is when you have to do something that you are not prepared to do. If you have to make a 5-foot putt and you haven’t practiced enough, you’re going to feel pressure. If you practiced it, you want to be there to show people how good you are.”\n\n“If you’ve got to take a test to get into medical school and you haven’t prepared, you’re nervous. If you’ve really prepared for that test and they cancel it, you’re disappointed. You want to show them how much you’ve done and that’s what pressure is.”\n\n“The best advice I can give you is win. Win stands for what’s important now (WIN). You’ve just had a birdie, what’s important now? The (next) tee shot. You’ve just made a bogey, what’s important now? Tee shot. Evaluate the past, focus on the future, but tell yourself what you have to do in the present.”\n\n“Ten percent of you won’t remember 10 percent of what I said 10 minutes after I said it.”\n\n“I’m not a dancer, not an entertainer, not an intellect. I graduated in the lower third of my high school class. If there wasn’t people like me, there wouldn’t have been an upper half.”\n\n“I have written three New York Times best-sellers. I’m the guy in the world who has written more books than he has read.”\n\n“He’s smart, he’s intelligent, and I love him like a brother, but we have a difference of opinion. He was a player, I was a coach. He made suggestions, I made decisions. He showered after work, I showered before work. He signed his paycheck on the back. I sighed it on the front. On TV, I tell him, ‘Mark, I would love to agree with you, but if I did, we’d both be wrong.”\n\n“Ability is what you’re capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.”\n\n“It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it.”\n\n“Life is 10 percent what happens to you and 90 percent how you respond to it.”\n\n“I can’t believe that God put us on this earth to be ordinary.”\n\n“No one has ever drowned in sweat.”\n\n“Don’t tell your problems to people: eighty percent don’t care; and the other twenty percent are glad you have them.”\n\n“When all is said and done, more is said than done.”\n\n“I follow three rules: Do the right thing, do the best you can, and always show people you care.”\n\n“Virtually nothing is impossible in this world if you just put your mind to it and maintain a positive attitude.”\n\n“You’re never as good as everyone tells you when you win, and you’re never as bad as they say when you lose.”\n\nFormer BYU athletic director Val Hale remembers a story Holtz told about playing Navy with the banners of all the World War II naval battles hanging on the press box. A player said, “We can’t beat those guys. Look at the schedule they play!”\n\nSaid Hale: “Lou Holtz was obviously an enormously successful football coach, and that was because he was a great motivator. I loved listening to him talk. He was so inspiring — and funny. He reminded me a little of Frank Layden. He was full of stories. I can only imagine what playing for him was like.”\n\nAll of our days are numbered, and if Coach Holtz is looking at his last days, I hope that if there are games in heaven and there is a need for a commentator, the angels call Lou and give him some airtime.",

    "fullText": "Cincinnati Bengals urged to sign All-Pro defender in free agency originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDefense has been a persistent problem for the Cincinnati Bengals in recent seasons, and they’re being urged to do something about it.\n\nPro Football Focus’ Bradley Locker recently listed one free agent that every team should pursue over the offseason, and for the Bengals, that pick was linebacker Devin Lloyd.\n\nLloyd is coming off of the first Pro Bowl and Second Team All-Pro nods of his career, and would represent a clear upgrade for Cincinnati in the middle of the field.\n\n“The Bengals have no choice but to tweak their defensive personnel this season after finishing 29th in EPA per play and 28th in success rate. Although all three levels could use boosts, Cincinnati ranked dead last in overall grade at linebacker — which Lloyd could fix in one fell swoop,” Locker wrote.\n\nMore: Bengals predicted to land two-time Super Bowl champion in free agency\n\n\"... With the seventh-most cap space currently available, the Bengals could use a defensive splash, and the 27-year-old would definitely qualify.\"\n\nIn 15 regular season games for the Jacksonville Jaguars this past season, Lloyd recorded 81 tackles, including six for a loss, seven passes defended, five interceptions, 1.5 sacks and one fumble recovery.\n\nHis productive play probably made the Jaguars regret declining his fifth-year option prior to the season. If they had picked the option up, they could have had Lloyd back in Jacksonville at a reasonable rate next season.\n\nInstead, they'll likely lose him in free agency. But, Jacksonville's loss can be another team's gain.

    "fullText": "At -125, Shohei Ohtani is breathing rarefied air at his current price.\n\nConsider last year, when he was the overwhelming preseason favorite to win NL MVP, and he was still only +150 by the end of March, per Sports Odds History. That was already crazy, because the shortest number we've generally seen in recent years is +200 or +300.\n\nBelow, we'll look at the early MLB odds for the 2026 season, and AL & NL MVP, as the likes of Alex Bregman (Chicago Cubs) and Kyle Tucker (Los Angeles Dodgers) have found new homes since our previous look.\n\nHere are the last 10 winners of the AL and NL MVP Award, with Shohei Ohtani leading the way as a four-time winner, with two in the AL and two in the NL. Only Frank Robinson has also won MVP awards in both leagues.\n\nBarry Bonds holds the record for most MVP awards (seven)\n\nThe New York Yankees have won the most MVPs in MLB history with 25, while the St. Louis Cardinals are second, leading all NL teams, with 21. No player for the Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Mets, or Tampa Bay Rays has ever won MVP.\n\nMost sportsbooks will display odds in the American format as listed above. When Goldschmidt ran away with the MVP award in 2022 his odds had a minus (-) sign ahead of the number for a large part of the season.\n\nThat means that a bettor in August had to wager $6,000 to win $100 by betting on Goldy to win MVP. Before the season starts, almost every player will have a plus (+) sign ahead of their odds.\n\nThat means a bettor would have profited $200 for a $100 wager on Ohtani before the season started.\n\nIf American odds aren't your thing, simply use a tool like our odds converter to switch the odds to decimal or fractional format. Most online sportsbooks also give you the option to change the odds format that you see.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJordon Hudson took Bill Belichick’s Pro Football Hall of Fame snub personal by planning a celebration of her own.\n\nAccording to a report from People, Belichick's girlfriend is organizing a “huge bash” for the legendary coach on Aug. 8 — the same day the Pro Football Hall of Fame will induct its Class of 2026 in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThe party is expected to take place just weeks before Belichick begins his second season as the head coach at North Carolina. The event is reportedly intended as a show of support after Belichick fell one vote short of first-ballot induction, receiving 39 of the 40 votes required for election.\n\nHudson is expected to invite several prominent figures closely tied to Belichick’s career, including Tom Brady, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells. Many of whom would have otherwise attended the ceremony in Canton. An anonymous source told People the purpose of the bash is “to celebrate alongside all of his people.”\n\nBelichick’s omission sparked widespread reaction across the NFL world, with reports suggesting internal politics among voters may have played a role.\n\nIn response to the backlash, the Hall of Fame released a statement affirming the integrity of its selection process and noting that any violations of voting bylaws could result in disciplinary action.\n\nBelichick, who owns eight Super Bowl rings — six as a head coach — and a 302-165 career record, has not publicly addressed the snub.

    "description": "The Ravens have identified two candidates to serve as their new wide receivers coach.",
    "fullText": "Ravens offensive coordinator Declan Doyle has identified two initial candidates to be the wide receivers coach on his new staff following Greg Lewis’ departure to Cleveland.\n\nPrentice Gill, who has been an offensive assistant in Baltimore for the last two years, will interview for the job this week, per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero. Gill is officially listed as a coaching fellow in the team media guide. He has primarily worked with the Ravens’ receivers and oversaw back-to-back Pro Bowl campaigns from Zay Flowers. Rashod Bateman also put up career-highs in 2024, though he regressed significantly this past season.\n\nGill played wide receiver at Old Dominion University and moved into coaching after he finished school. He worked his way up through the college ranks and eventually worked at USC under then-OC, now-Ravens QBs coach Tee Martin. Jobs at Oregon, Arizona State, and prep school powerhouse IMG Academy followed before Gill’s move to the NFL in 2024. In that time, Gill worked with an impressive list of wide receivers, including Amon-Ra St. Brown, Michael Pittman, JuJu-Smith Schuster, Ricky Pearsall, Velus Jones Jr., and projected 2024 first-round pick Carnell Tate. Gill also coached Johnny Wilson and Juwan Johnson in college, who both converted to tight end in the NFL.\n\nThe Ravens are also expected to interview Jaguars assistant WRs coach Tyler Tettleton, according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. That name may be familiar to Baltimore sports fans. Tyler Tettleton’s father, Mickey, was a star catcher for the Orioles from 1988 to 1990 with All-Star and Silver Slugger honors in 1989.\n\nTyler Tettleton played football at Ohio University before embarking on a coaching career in 2015. He spent three years at the University of Oklahoma before one-year stints with the Jets, the Browns, LSU, and his alma mater before arriving in Jacksonville as an assistant running backs coach in 2022. He moved over to assistant WRs coach in 2023 and survived the Jaguars’ 2025 coaching change to Liam Coen.\n\nTettleton has also worked with several talented wide receivers in his career, though he has not always been coaching them directly. He overlapped with Jarvis Landry and Odell Beckham Jr. in Cleveland and Terrace Marshall, Kayshon Boutte, and Trey Palmer at LSU. In Jacksonville, he helped Travis Etienne hit the ground running in 2022 after missing his entire rookie season due to injury. He then coached Calvin Ridley to a 1,000-yard campaign in his first season back from suspension and assisted in the rookie breakout of 2024 first-round pick Brian Thomas Jr. Thomas struggled this season, but 2023 sixth-rounder Parker Washington had a breakout season of his own under Tettleton’s tutelage.",

Not really.\n\nBut a chant to fire the guy? Man, that seems misguided.\n\nFormer Bonnies player Dion Wright had this to say on X:\n\nIt’s either you die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain . . . Chanting “fire schmidt” is absolutely disgusting. A lot of people didn’t even know anything about St. Bonaventure until he got there. At the end of the day it’s a players game.\n\n— Dion Wright (@TheWrightHoops) February 1, 2026\n\nThe four seasons before Schmidt was hired at Bonaventure all featured single-digit wins.\n\nIt took him just one year of rebuilding before he got to 15 wins in his second season.\n\nThey haven't won fewer than 14 games in a season in his entire tenure.\n\nThat includes three NCAA Tournament appearances and two trips to the Round of 32.\n\nSchmidt is Bonaventure's all-time wins leader, now with 337 wins and counting.\n\nAnd this isn't like other jobs. Bonaventure, with an enrollment of less than 3,000 students, is one of the few smallest Division I basketball programs in the country.\n\nIn the NIL era and transfer-heavy era, it's hard to get recruits to come to Olean.\n\nAnd so somehow, that all led to the chants by Bonnies fans. Apparently some people feel that way.\n\nThere are plenty of St. Bonaventure faithful who would never dream such a fate on Schmidt.\n\nMORE: Gerry McNamara shares his thoughts on Adrian Autry",

    "fullText": "Florida State (7-15, 2-8 ACC) was defeated by Clemson (16-7, 7-4 ACC) by a 77-58 score this afternoon at Littlejohn Coliseum.\n\nClemson scored the first four points of the game as the Tigers did a great job forcing Florida State to take tough shots. Sole Williams hit a driving layup for the first Seminole points. Midway through the quarter Clemson hit FSU with a 10-2 run to take a 16-9 lead. Tatum Greene buried a three to end the run. Taylor Johnson-Matthews hit a triple to give Clemson a 21-15 lead going into the second quarter.\n\nThat shot from Johnson-Matthews sparked the Tigers to a 10-1 run that allowed them to take a 28-16 lead. Mari Gerton broke the run with a nifty putback. However, the Tigers were able to stretch the lead to 42-27 at the half.\n\nThe Tigers ended the third quarter on a 10-2 run to take a 60-41 lead into the fourth quarter. From there Clemson cruised to the 77-58 victory.\n\nSole Williams was the only Seminole in double figures with 23 points.\n\nThe story of this game was that Florida State was unable to maintain any offensive continuity. If the Seminoles aren’t hitting threes (5-21 today) the offense really struggles. This is due to the fact that FSU rarely gets easy baskets. There are a couple of reasons for the lack of easy baskets. First, Florida State usually plays one-on-one offense in the frontcourt. This means that unless there is a blow-by, the shot will be contested. Secondly, the Seminoles don’t get many transition buckets (two fast break points today) or second chance points (13 today). These are the two main ways to get easy baskets.\n\nThe Seminoles did hold their own on the boards and they only had 12 turnovers which is a reasonable number. However, it is tough to beat good teams when you shoot so poorly from the field.\n\nThe Seminoles will travel to Raleigh, NC to face NC State on Thursday. The game will tip at 8pm and will be broadcast on the ACC Network.",

    "description": "When Justin Rose won the 2019 Farmers Insurance Open, his longtime looper, Mark Fulcher, watched from a hospital bed after having heart surgery",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — There was a celebration before the celebration during Justin Rose’s triumphant walk up the 18th hole at Torrey Pines on Sunday in his seven-shot victory in the Farmers Insurance Open.\n\nAs the CBS cameras followed Rose and his caddie, Mark “Fooch” Fulcher, the two exchanged laughs and a message into the camera for the golfer’s one-time caddie, Gareth Lord. It was Lord who was on Rose’s bag in 2019 when the Englishman won his first title at Torrey Pines. At the time, Fulcher watched the proceedings from a hospital bed, having undergone mitral valve surgery on his heart that January.\n\n“I think we were just trying to have a little bit of banter and make light of the fact, ‘Hey, Lordie, I hope you're watching now because now it's Fooch's turn to be walking down the 18th with me here at Torrey,’” Rose said in the winner’s news conference.\n\nAs Rose fashioned a historic victory in which he set the 36-, 54 and 72-hole scoring records, ultimately finishing at 23 under, he said he never brought up the past with Fulcher—until the end.\n\nAfter recovering from the surgery, Fulcher returned to loop for Rose at the 2019 Masters, but soon after announced that he’d be taking a leave. Rose won twice in the interim before he and Fulcher reunited at the 2023 Ryder Cup, and together they won the 2025 FedEx St. Jude Championship in the playoffs. Among the victories for which Fulcher has been on Rose’s bag are his 2013 U.S. Open win and gold medal performance in the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n“I think that win,” Rose said of the 2019 Farmers, “was always a tough one for Fooch—not fighting for his life, but he was in a pretty bad way in the hospital and seeing us kind of cruise to victory and, you know, hugging Lordie on the 18th green.\n\n“Nearly had to have another procedure after that, I think,” Rose added with a chuckle.\n\n“It was in my head all [this] week, 'wouldn't be it nice to win with Fooch here.' It was totally unsaid until across the water on 18. I was, like, that was fun to enjoy that with him.”",

    "description": "Amid the talk about the Dodgers' spending, a special agreement between MLB and the Dodgers over L.A.'s TV money share has come up.",
    "fullText": "Amid the conversation about the team’s spending, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ TV deal with Spectrum has come up, namely, a special clause that allows the Dodgers to retain an additional portion of their TV revenue.\n\nThe signing of outfielder Kyle Tucker has sparked a total meltdown on social media, with fanbases from all over the MLB spectrum coming out of the woodwork and calling out the Dodgers for “ruining baseball.”\n\nTucker is set to earn $60 million per season, an incredibly high average annual value, which will have him among the highest-paid athletes in the sport. He is joining a team already full of stars in Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Freddie Freeman — the reigning World Series champions.\n\nAs a result, an agreement between the Dodgers’ owners, the Guggenheim Group, and MLB has begun to circulate.\n\nThe LA Times’ Bill Shaikin outlined the terms of the deal between MLB and the Dodgers that have indeed led to the team keeping a larger share of its revenue.\n\nWhile trying to oust Frank McCourt as an owner in MLB, the league blocked a $3 billion deal between the Dodgers and Fox Sports, prompting McCourt to file a suit in bankruptcy court.\n\nMcCourt was trying to sell the team for all its worth, and he needed to make sure bidders knew what to expect from a TV deal.\n\nIn bankruptcy court, MLB agreed that the fair-market value for the Dodgers’ TV deal was the Fox offer, meaning the league would take its 34 percent cut based on those terms.\n\nHowever, the Dodgers ended up striking a deal worth more than $8 billion, though MLB could not take more from the new deal.\n\nDuring an appearance on Dodgers Dougout with Doug McKain, Shakin explained how the deal materialized.\n\n“In a nutshell, in order to get Frank McCourt out, which was the objective from MLB, they had to make a deal with him in bankruptcy court,” Shakin said on the show.\n\n“And part of that deal was how are you going to value the television contract? And since a television contract did not exist at that time, because a new owner had not even been selected, they did the best they could.\n\n“And Guggenheim came out with a really great offer that I think blew even MLB’s wildest expectations away. MLB wasn’t thrilled, but they’re living by the terms of the deal, and that’s where we are.”\n\nA lot of people have been on the timeline complaining about the Dodgers “unfair TV deal”\n\nThe truth is even if the Dodgers gave up more of that money to other teams, opposing owners still wouldn’t spend ????\n\n(W/ @dmac_la) pic.twitter.com/f4wkjmBU4D\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) January 28, 2026\n\nMLB did try to push for new terms that hold the Dodgers to the same standard as other teams, but the settlement in bankruptcy court was too much of a blocker.\n\nHowever, as Shakin outlines, the Dodgers’ new owners, Guggenheim, did work with MLB to find a middle ground.\n\n“So in a normal situation, Major League Baseball would have said, this is a crazy high deal and good for you, and we’re happy, but we gotta share this money just like we share any other money.\n\n“And in this case, MLB could only push so far because Guggenheim was willing to work with MLB to a point. And then Guggenheim could have gone back to the court and said, ‘we got a deal, please, Mr. Judge, enforce the deal. That’s what you’re here for.’\n\n“And the court, as they say in legal circles, has jurisdiction over the deal, which means they run everything.\n\n“So, MLB could have been stuck with the original settlement, which was not as favorable as what they got in the negotiations with Guggenheim.\n\n“Is it equal for all other teams? Absolutely not. Is it a competitive advantage for the Dodgers? Sure. Now, is it as big a competitive advantage as some people are making it? I don’t think so ’cause the contract itself is way more than the individual amount the Dodgers are saving every year.”",

    "fullText": "Football doesn’t start at kick-off. It starts when you leave the house. As the new season gets underway this month, let's reflect on what has earned K league a permanent spot in our hearts.\n\nThe growing desire for more analytically based football commentary has seeped its way into Korea. This is partly due to the surge of young talent, and to established K League players, now attracting the gaze of European (and sometimes Asian and North American) scouting departments. Oxford United supporters will want more substance than“Jeon Jin-woo is a really good player” before welcoming him to the Kassam Stadium.\n\nAlways a special moment. The floodlights are on as they appear for the first time.\n\nHowever, even I must draw the line somewhere. Covering Suwon Bluewings has been both fun and tragic - depending on the fortunes of the club - but delving deeper into the tactical approach of Byun Seung-hwan during his ill-fated spell in charge of the Bluewings doesn’t keep me awake at night. Nor does duels won, or any of the following in the alphabet soup; xG, xA, PPDA, OBV, and npxG.\n\nWhat excites me far more is the smell of a K League stadium on matchday. Regular viewers will know Korean grounds come in all shapes and sizes: from giant 2002 World Cup venues, to rudimentary multi-purpose local grounds with basic amenities, to city-built concrete bowls with temporary seating added to improve the experience, to the small - but hopefully increasing - number of football-specific stadiums.\n\nIf you are looking for club names that represent all of those styles, I give you: FC Seoul (2002 World Cup), Busan IPark (basic structure), FC Anyang (temporary seating), and Daegu FC (football-specific). Korean geography experts will be aware that these clubs are situated from north to south, in different cities across different provinces. It is a hotchpotch of styles, sizes, and designs.\n\nBig Bird: Defined by that roof covering those seats.\n\nAnd let’s pay tribute to the grounds I haven’t mentioned yet. For World Cup memories, how about Suwon’s magnificent Big Bird, with its landmark roof covering the main stand? Or Jeju’s own version, accompanied by views of the ocean and an extinct volcano? How about the football-specific marvels in Pohang and Incheon - easily two of the country’s best venues? Like Anyang, Bucheon and Gangwon have sought to minimise the impact of the running track. But if you prefer big, brutalist concrete bowls, trot along to Gimcheon, Cheongju, or Paju.\n\nOne thing Korean stadiums have in common, though (with the occasional exception of Daegu and Incheon), is that getting a ticket to see the football is rarely a problem. Daegu’s small capacity of 12,419 means a sell-out is possible, but for almost every other stadium in Korea, access is guaranteed - even without buying a ticket in advance.\n\nWhen the last of the winter snow finally melts away, Korea really comes alive. Nothing grows in winter. The trees are bare for several months. No flowers can pierce the icy ground. A country so vibrant with colour and vegetation becomes a post-apocalyptic wasteland during the short, bitter days of winter. There is an absence of green. Even the ground is brown and lifeless.\n\nThe end of that is the beginning of football.\n\nIncheon's South Stand is one-of-a-kind in Korea.\n\nHow tragic would it be if the K League decided - or was forced - to adopt a more global calendar, playing through the winter in what is rapidly becoming the September-May norm? The heat and humidity of July and August are genuine concerns, but is that worse than frozen pitches, the possibility of heavy snow causing cancellations, and temperatures in some parts of the country dipping to -14°C? I’ll let you decide.\n\nThat debate can be saved for another day. Like most football fans, the itch to return to a stadium is becoming unbearable. I miss football, but I don’t yearn for discussions about our main striker’s xG, the new formation the manager is trying in pre-season, how the foreign imports will adapt, or how good this teenage local lad might be.\n\nAs much as anywhere on the planet, Korean football is about the matchday experience.\n\nIt starts with an early-morning KTX trip from Gwangmyeong Station to Gimcheon. From there, a local bus to the city centre for lunch. By now, you’ve already caught your first glimpse of jerseys walking down the street. This is when the excitement and anticipation really begin to rise. Follow the crowd until you catch sight of a stadium wall, or a floodlight set against the backdrop of a magnificent mountain.\n\nOver the years, I’ve accumulated some great K League memories simply from walking to a stadium. From Seogwipo, the walk to Jeju’s wonderful stadium is around five kilometres. It is long - and probably excessive - but the glorious coastline keeps you company along the way. The sparkle off the sea as the sun sets in the west is a joy to behold. You cannot escape the gaze of Hallasan to your right, nor the rich vegetation and palm trees spread out in all directions.\n\nCompare that with modern-day Anyang. Leaving the city centre towards the Sports Complex, the scenery shifts from the quiet beauty of the Anyang River to the incomprehensible scale of heavy construction surrounding the stadium. I have photos of Anyang Stadium from 2020, with Gwanaksan and planes landing at Gimpo clearly visible. Those days are gone now, but it does highlight the immense potential of the club as they look to prolong their stay in K League 1.\n\nAs the skyline changes rapidly around Anyang Stadium, treasure moments like this.\n\nI don’t think any walk compares to a visit to Pohang Steel Yard. This is partly out of necessity - Pohang is a small city with no subway system. The stadium sits across the river from the city centre, buried deep within the POSCO complex. Buses and cars crawl along at a snail’s pace. But the walk itself is fascinating. Only then can you truly appreciate the size and scale of POSCO; the stadium is dwarfed in comparison. If you’re lucky, the stroll will be interrupted by a slow-moving cargo train.\n\nAfterall, Korean stadiums are shaped by their surroundings. Like Pohang, the backdrop to Jeonnam Dragons' home stadium isn't defined by lush forests or imposing mountains. Smoke towers from another POSCO factory puncture the skyline. Busan's Gudeok couldn't be more distinct. The stadium has no remarkable features, but that is compensated by the backdrop of Gudeok Mountain.\n\nSadly, we mourn the loss of Gangwon FC's former home. It is a massive shame Chuncheon is off the menu in 2026, although it will host K3 matches. Chuncheon has one of Korea's best culinary experiences indakgalbi - stir-fried chicken marinated in a spicy gochujang-based sauce. The 45-minute walk to the stadium is irrelevant when you reach the banks of North Han River, with its breathtaking views of the river and mountains. You can even go canoeing or take a cable car before kickoff.\n\nKorean football is a league of journeys. Some are short, whilst others require an airplane. None are long enough that can be considered burdensome. Seongnam's Tacheon Stadium is next to the river by the same name. River paths and biking go hand-in-hand in Korea. Hwaseong Stadium is the only one that tests your sense of adventure. Good luck getting there if you don't have a car.\n\nTo give the K League some credit, player names on jerseys are still written in hangeul. Outside the stadium, an hour before kick-off, as you sip a cold can of beer, watch the supporters shuffle past in their own unique colours, with hangeul characters on their backs. The green of Jeonbuk Hyundai to the orange of Gangwon FC. Jeonnam Dragons in yellow to Cheonan City in sky blue. Different names, colours, crest. Each adds something to the rich tapestry of K League football.\n\nOnce inside, it doesn’t get much better than a sunny Saturday afternoon in Suwon. The seating colour scheme, the razor sharp edges of the stands, the blue jerseys, flags, the second-half umbrella display, and the constant beat of La Banda de Uman. It is the best stadium in Korea to sit back and reflect on the meaning of it all, as 22 players and 14,000 fans put on a show for you.\n\nThere are more. Anyang under the lights is raucous. FC Seoul can attract Premier League-level crowds once or twice a season. Incheon United’s stadium oozes class, not least the single-tier terrace behind the goal. Then there is the aforementioned Pohang: a distinct two-tiered stadium with steep stands offering perfect sight-lines.\n\nPohang Steel Yard with its steep stands is very atmospheric.\n\nThis is not to say analytics are unimportant in football. There is clearly a market for them, as fans try to understand more about a new signing or a rumoured name arriving from overseas. But that conversation has never been what draws me back, week after week.\n\nFor me, football lives in the hours before kick-off. It lives on train platforms, on crowded buses, and on long walks through unfamiliar neighbourhoods. It lives in the first sight of a floodlight between apartment blocks, in the slow build of noise as more scarves and jerseys appear, and in the way a stadium reveals itself - suddenly or gradually - depending on where you are.\n\nThe K League is not something I analyse. It is something I travel through. It changes with the seasons, with the cities, and with the people who follow it. You can measure passes, pressing, and probability if you like - but you cannot evaluate the feeling of arriving.\n\nThat is the side of Korean football I want to share with you in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Alongside Marcel Sabitzer (back), captain Emre Can also missed out due to illness. Niklas Süle, on the other hand, returned to the squad. Four days after the Champions League match against Inter Milan (a 2-0 defeat), head coach Niko Kovac made five changes to the starting XI, as Anton, Couto, Svensson, Adeyemi and Brandt replaced Ryerson, Bensebaini, Beier and Fabio Silva (who all dropped to the bench), while Can missed out completely. Filippo Mane remained in the team.\n\nThe match:With courageous, high pressing, Heidenheim put BVB under pressure early on, disrupting the build-up play and celebrated every Black & Yellow misplaced pass as confirmation of their own performance. Dortmund had a hard time finding gaps in the opponents, who were man-marking tightly and uncompromisingly. Corners led to a lot of pushing and pulling in the six-yard box.\n\nAnd so it went until the 14th minute, before 81,365 spectators in the sold-out SIGNAL IDUNA PARK saw the first shot: for once, Guirassy had shaken off Mainka, but failed to beat the Heidenheim goalkeeper Ramaj from a tight angle. On 38 minutes, after good work by Brandt, Guirassy’s delicate chip struck the crossbar. Until then, there had been only two chances for BVB, and Heidenheim also had one, but Kobel denied Dinkci from eleven metres out in the 26th minute.\n\nThe eighth (!) corner finally gave BVB the lead shortly before the break. Couto floated the cross in, and Siersleben hindered his own goalkeeper, causing Ramaj to drop the ball. Anton reacted the fastest, making it 1-0 in the 44th minute. But at the end of the five-minute injury time period, Heidenheim’s Honsak made good progress down the left, Mane picked up an injury and had to pull up. Honsak’s cross landed at the feet of Niehues, who prodded the ball over the line to make it 1-1 going into the break .\n\nSüle replaced Mane at the restart and shortly afterwards let Heidenheim substitute Arijon Ibrahimovic past him, whose back pass found Niehues, who hammered the ball goalwards from 22 metres out. Svensson got his thigh in the way, but the deflection gave Kobel no chance and the away side celebrated a 2-1 lead in the 48th minute. Ten minutes later, Marvin Pieringer was given the freedom of SIGNAL IDUNA PARK and could have added a third. Kovac responded, and instantly looked to get his side on the front foot: Beier replaced Couto, Chukwuemeka came on for Bellingham, with Brandt dropping a little deeper.\n\nWithin two minutes, the Black & Yellow had turned the game around. After Brandt’s cross, Guirassy was denied by Ramaj, and Nmecha’s follow-up from the resulting corner was cleared. But the VAR intervened: Dorsch had handled the ball after Brandt’s cross. Dr. Jöllenbeck pointed to the spot. Ramaj managed to get a touch on Guirassy’s well placed shot, but couldn’t keep it out – it was 2-2 in the 68th minute. Less than two minutes later, Brandt initiated a counter-attack. Beier stormed down the right wing, cut the ball back to Guirassy, who got a good connection despite being on his way down five yards from goal, and the ball found the corner to make it 3-2 on 70 minutes.\n\nFive minutes before the final whistle, Guirassy could have put the game to bed early. Jöllenbeck did not hesitate to give another penalty after Busch fouled Guirassy. This time, however, Guirassy shot well over the bar, meaning the game was still alive. Instead, Ibrahimovic missed a chance to potentially make it 3-3 at the start of the eight minutes of injury time, but his effort whistled past the post. Then Mikkel Kaufmann grazed the crossbar in the 95th minute, but the guests did not manage to get the ball over the line, and the Black & Yellow.\n\nOutlook:  After six games in three weeks to kick off the year, BVB have their first \"normal\" week of training of the year, which will end next Saturday with the away game at VfL Wolfsburg (kick-off: 15:30 CET)..\n\nFootball Bundesliga, Matchday 20 Saturday, 1 February 2026, 17:30 CET\n\nBor. Dortmund: Kobel – Mane (Süle, 46), Anton, Schlotterbeck – Yan Couto (Beier, 58), Bellingham (Chukwuemeka, 58), Nmecha, Svensson – Adeyemi (Fabio Silva, 69), Brandt – Guirassy (90+3 Özcan)\n\nBench: Meyer, Drewes, Bensebaini, Ryerson\n\n1.

    "fullText": "(at the press conference): “Today, you saw a game that was great for the spectators, but less so for me personally as a coach. I want to see games like these put to bed much more confidently, more quickly and earlier, rather than getting ourselves in trouble. The bottom line, however, is a team that gets up again in the second half after going behind and has the ability to fight back again. We have started the Bundesliga in 2026 with four wins and a draw. I’m happy about that.”\n\nThe press conference with both head coaches\n\nSebastian Kehl (in the mixed zone): “We take the lead, but we don’t get the game done and dusted, then we concede two goals relatively quickly and find ourselves behind. What was really good was that we showed a strong mentality, that we got back into the game. Nevertheless, it was tight again. We want to do better. We need to do better. That has to be our target. Once again, we missed one or two chances to score the fourth or fifth goal to settle the game in our favour. We need to play football better. We need to win games more comfortably.” We need to work on ourselves before we think about anything else.”\n\nNico Schlotterbeck (on DAZN): “We controlled the first half, and then it's 1-1 because Filippo (Mane) gets injured.” In the second half there were some crazy moments for both sides. We had a lot of chances, but we also allowed them a lot and were a bit fortunate to win – but we got the win. The problem (with both penalties, which Schlotterbeck ultimately passed the ball to Serhou Guirassy) is that they try to unsettle the penalty taker. And penalties are not my core discipline. I waited until everyone was out of the way and asked Serhou if he felt confident and wanted to shoot.”\n\nSerhou Guirassy (on DAZN): “Sometimes I score, sometimes I don’t. Last year, I scored, I don't know, maybe 45 goals. This season is a little more difficult. That’s football. I play to have fun. And for me, it was a crazy game because it was like this on one hand (scoring two goals) – and on the other hand like that (missing a penalty). But we won again, and that is the most important thing. But that’s it for me on penalties for the time being.”\n\nGregor Kobel (in the mixed zone): “The points are all that matters. But of course, it was too wild. We have now won four out of five games, which is a great statistic. It is also important to focus on the positive things. If you go to the ball and want to catch it, it's a very delicate process (regarding the disallowed Heidenheim goal in the first half). Even if there is only a small touch on the arms, you can no longer hold the ball. He hits my arms, so it has to be a foul.”",

    "fullText": "Braces: Serhou Guirassy had by far the most shots of all players (seven) and also contested the most duels (29). He celebrated his seventh and eighth goals of the season and is now out on his own as top scorer for the Black & Yellows (Maximilian Beier follows in second place with six goals). Guirassy bagged his second brace of the Bundesliga season, having previously managed the feat on Matchday 2 in the 3-0 home win against Union Berlin. He did, however, miss a chance for a hat-trick to seal the game, firing over the bar from the penalty spot. In five games against Heidenheim, he has found the back of the net five times.\n\nWelcome: 1. FC Heidenheim are the only current Bundesliga team against which Borussia Dortmund have never lost (four wins, two draws).\n\nThree goals: BVB once again scored exactly three goals in the fifth league game in 2026.\n\nImpressive return: 45 points after 20 match days are still BVB’s best return in seven years.\n\nPlenty of penalties: For the first time in almost exactly two years, BVB were awarded two penalty kicks in a Bundesliga match. On 28 January 2024, Niclas Füllkrug scored both against Bochum.\n\nMr 100 percent: Waldemar Anton won each of his six duels in the first half and scored his first home goal for BVB.\n\nA threat from set pieces: The 1-0 was the fifth BVB goal from a corner this season.\n\nOne hundred: Nico Schlotterbeck played his 100th Bundesliga match for Borussia Dortmund. He has also played 49 games for SC Freiburg, and a further 16 for Union Berlin.\n\nTwo hundred: Gregor Kobel completed his 200th competitive game for BVB. The 28-year-old Swiss moved from VfB Stuttgart to the Borsigplatz in 2021.\n\nTwice: Filippo Mane was named in the BVB starting lineup for the second time in just four days – first in the Champions League, and today in the Bundesliga (fourth overall appearance). The 20-year-old had previously only been in the starting formation for the first game of the season, when was sent off in the 3-3 draw at FC St. Pauli.",

    "title": "Adapting Europe's Urban Landscapes to Climate Change Through the Power of Nature",
    "description": "A multi-pronged approach to building climate resilience in cities.",
    "fullText": "The effects of climate change are here now, and cities in Europe and across the world are disproportionately feeling the consequences. As more people migrate to urban areas—by 2050, 70% of the world’s population will live in cities—the demand on urban systems will only increase. To solve these issues, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) spent five years developing innovative approaches that help cities adapt to and mitigate against the impacts of a changing climate.\n\nUrban greening, a nature-based solution implemented in cities, offers a tremendous opportunity to tackle the climate challenges that affect urban areas in an outsized way. Their benefits are numerous: from cleaning the air to easing the pressure on stormwater systems to providing habitat that promotes biodiversity and ecological balance. There’s also a direct impact on human wellbeing: urban greening provides areas for relaxation, exercise and social interaction, while simultaneously reducing temperatures to keep cities livable in the face of climate change.\n\nThe funding, skills and capacity needed to implement these solutions can be challenging, yet city governments, local businesses and communities are clamouring \n\nTNC chose Germany as the site for these projects because cities across the country were eager to engage in urban greening efforts, even though they often lacked the municipal resources to do so. Ultimately, TNC and local partners co-created three bodies of work that demonstrate the power of city involvement in finding effective, scalable, nature-based solutions to mitigate the dual challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\nCharlottenburg-Wilmersdorf District, Berlin\n\nTNC formed a strategic partnership with the Environmental and Nature Conservation Office in Berlin’s Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf District in 2020.  Significant funding from TNC allowed the partners to jointly create a new staff position to provide scientific support, project planning and implementation throughout the project. A focal point of the partnership was creating a districtwide Greenprint, a tool that reveals the range of opportunities for urban greening and benefits provided by natural infrastructure when incorporated into community planning.\n\nIn Stuttgart, TNC tested a new funding model for urban nature-based solutions that brought together multiple stakeholders from different sectors. Leveraging a €10 million Climate Innovation Fund that the City launched to support net-zero projects by public, private and nonprofit groups, TNC partnered with the Stuttgart municipal government to create a dedicated funding line for urban greening projects.\n\nThe goal was to create a financial incentive that would be open to any sector, including for-profit and start-up companies, helping to overcome the incentive gap barrier and accelerate the creation of nature-based solutions for the City. Given Stuttgart’s history of being a site of technological innovation, there was also a focus on the potential creation of an innovative, scalable approach that could continue to replicate on its own in the future. In total, 19 projects were developed.\n\nPartnership with Environmental Action Germany\n\nAs climate change continues to elevate temperatures in urban areas, sensitive age groups such as children and the elderly, as well as socioeconomically disadvantaged segments, bear the brunt of these challenges. TNC and partner Environmental Action Germany (Deutsche Umwelthilfe - DUH) collaborated to understand how urban greening can address these impacts. They focused on transforming urban areas, including school campuses, into valuable ecological and climate-resilient areas that simultaneously tackle the growing issue of urban heat, lack of biodiversity and the need for more nature-based solutions in the most densely populated urban areas.\n\nTNC and DUH collaboratively created Woods 'R' Us to address the health impacts of climate change on children. This program transforms German schoolyards, typically composed of concrete-heavy open spaces with little shade and few natural elements, into green spaces rich in biodiversity, adaptive to the climate and offer shade that cleans and cools the air. The program, which also focuses on introducing students to the wonders of nature, included:\n\nWhen paired together, these pilots become a powerful, multi-pronged approach to climate change that can serve as a template for others looking to implement nature-based solutions in the future. Over the course of the five-year program, TNC gained key insights that municipalities and stakeholders can apply in their own communities:\n\nThere is a gap between thinkers and doers: policymakers and planners often have more freedom to innovate, while those implementing and maintaining work face more constraints, leading to bottlenecks for new nature-based solutions.\n\nSecuring political backing is crucial, and science and research can help underpin effective policy and decision-making.\n\nInnovation funds, which can be replicated in other municipalities, face the challenge of securing necessary funding.\n\nEngagement from NGOs and the third sector is essential. They can close the gap by supporting public sector work, advocating for policy changes, facilitating experimentation, partnering with the private sector to change business practices, and helping bridge divides.\n\nBerlin’s Mierendorff Island Climate Adaptation Greenprint",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has boasted about strengthening the US economy since returning to the Oval Office. Meanwhile, millions of Americans say they're struggling to afford food, rent, and other basic necessities.\n\nGary Cohn, Trump's former chief economic advisor, said both these realities are true right now in America.\n\n\"If you look at gross domestic product, which is the overall output of the US economy, we're trending about 5% right now, which is a very high growth rate in the United States,\" Cohn said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nCohn, who is now IBM's vice chairman, also cited promising trends in inflation and unemployment rates.\n\nHowever, those numbers don't give the whole picture.\n\n\"That said, we've got an interesting economy,\" Cohn said. \"We have a massive wealth effect at the top end, and we have got hardworking Americans having a very difficult time paying their bills, and they are suffering in this economy.\"\n\nThat's why, Cohn said, the Trump administration is making affordability a key issue going forward.\n\n\"The White House is going on the offensive. The president is going to spend time out on the road talking about affordability,\" Cohn said. \"Affordability will be the issue between now and the mid-term elections.\"\n\nThe widening gap between wealthy and lower-income Americans is often described as a \"K-shaped economy.\" That's when people at the top see profound economic growth, while those at the bottom, who are more sensitive to economic shifts, face financial stress. Some economists have cautioned that a K-shaped economy portends bad days ahead.\n\n\"A silent majority of consumers is increasingly strained by a two-year affordability crisis and elevated borrowing costs,\" Gregory Daco, a chief economist at EY, said in a recent LinkedIn post. \"Slower income growth is pushing many upper-median, median, and lower-income families to draw down savings and rely more heavily on credit to sustain their habits.\"\n\nThe chief economist of RSM, Joe Brusuelas, said in a recent briefing that the US would need to undergo policy shifts to reshape the economy, but that likely won't happen in 2026.\n\n\"When I take a look at the policy landscape, it's all tilted toward the upper spur of the K,\" he said. \"So I'm expecting a further widening of that fundamental inequality in coming years.\"",

    "description": "A lifelong skier shares how teaching her husband and kids to ski took years of effort, frustration, and patience before it paid off.",
    "fullText": "I grew up skiing. As in, we lived in the mountains and skied every weekend of winter, kind of thing.\n\nAt one point, early in our relationship, my husband looked at me, semi-astonished: \"I think you're better on skis than feet.\" So it was reaaaally important to me that, first, my then fiancé (now husband) and I could share this amazing sport together, and second, that when my kids were old enough, they too would know the awkward joys of being thrown off a J-bar.\n\nBut before we could cruise the groomers as a family, we had to get through many painful winters learning to ski.\n\nI thought I could teach my husband. The problem was that what comes naturally to someone who's been doing it all her life is really hard to put into words for someone who, well, grew up in urban Chicago.\n\nBut we tried! We rented skis and hit the bunny hills, specifically at a small Midwest ski resort called \"Alpine Valley.\" What could go wrong?\n\nMy husband is athletic and approached skiing with the confidence of someone who is good at every sport he tries. Until he skied. As we crested the ridge of the first hill, it all happened in a millisecond.\n\nUnable to put my weak \"pizza pie!\" lessons into action, he immediately spun wildly out of control, barreling straight down the mountain, one ski and one pole in the air, screaming \"stop, stop, stop!\" until he eventually did, hitting a fluorescent orange snowmaking turbine with such force that it slowly whirred to life. By the time I got to him, he was already throwing his skis over his shoulders and walking. \"You know how you don't play basketball?\" He screamed at me. \"Maybe I just don't ski!\"\n\nNot the best start to our alpine life together.\n\nWe needed a few no-ski winters after that one. But eventually, we tried again, this time with calculated professional intervention. We headed to our home mountain (Sunapee) and enlisted the help of a calm, 65-year-old pro with lovely, encouraging-grandpa vibes. As the pair clomped into the lodge at the end of a long Saturday, they were both beaming. \"He can ski!\" said the instructor.\n\nKids, it turns out, are much harder (and more expensive) to offload. My strategy with them was to put in sheer hours on the hill. The only way out is through, kind of thing. Sacrificing gorgeous bluebird ski days and many, many hundreds of dollars' worth of adult lift tickets to cold, crabby ingrates between my skis.\n\nEventually, they got the hang of it. And eventually, I got my ski-family wish.\n\nThat first cruiser we did as a full family — it was bliss. Big wedge turns, ear-to-ear smiles, singing at the top of their lungs. Truly, all is worth it. Now my husband skis as well as I do, and both kids leave us in the dust. But that's the way of the world.",

    "description": "Europe fears it can't beat Russia's style of war — creating a golden opportunity for defense founders.",
    "fullText": "Kelluu began, as startups often do, in an old shed.\n\nThe small Finnish company makes airships — think van-sized blimps — originally designed to watch over power lines with cameras.\n\nWhen I met the firm's CEO, Janne Hietala, last fall, he arrived at our restaurant in Joensuu with news. Kelluu, a seven-year-old company, had just become a defense contractor.\n\nA NATO member had agreed to buy airships for surveillance under an alliance program pushing Western militaries to adopt new tech. The buyer hasn't been named, but it plans to integrate the airships into its military within two years.\n\nKelluu's ascent was just as rapid. The company's first showcase to NATO, Hietala said, was in November 2024.\n\nKelluu is trying to make it big in a market that hasn't been kind to small firms. Traditionally, Western nations have depended on giant contractors that meticulously take decades to create and fine-tune systems. These firms, often referred to as the \"primes,\" had all of the contacts and, by extension, all the business.\n\nBut now, the door is opening for founders from the commercial world.\n\nEvents in the last few years — the invasion of Ukraine, the second Trump administration, and the rise of drone warfare — have jolted NATO militaries, who now fear an overreliance on the primes. European generals and politicians alike agree: To convince Russia that it would lose a war, the continent needs a steady stream of ammo and equipment that can be quickly designed, tweaked, and produced in large quantities.\n\n\"It's no longer possible to just adhere to the old pace of months and years of planning, months or years of procurement, months or years of development,\" a spokesperson for Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or DIANA, the NATO agency that connected Kelluu with alliance members, told me.\n\nNATO conceptualized DIANA before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as a program for emerging firms to present their tech to allied militaries and potentially sign contracts. Following the outbreak of the war, the agency was established in 2023.\n\nThe agency said it received 4,000 applications for its next cohort, up from 2,400 last year and 1,200 in its inaugural batch in 2023. At least half of these firms and founders are from Europe.\n\nInvestors who once viewed the defense sector as taboo are scouring the industry. According to the NATO Innovation Fund in February, venture capital investments in European defense tech reached $1 billion in 2024, up by four times since 2020.\n\nI traveled in the fall of 2025 to northern Europe, where concerns about war with Russia run high, to speak with defense startups finding their corner of a market that was closed to them five years ago. To make it in the old defense world, small firms typically needed to be bought by a prime.\n\nWith that barrier fading, the founders I spoke to have set their ambitions high. The European Union has a new goal of allocating $920 billion more to defense by 2030, and NATO members are raising their commitment to spending 5% of GDP on their militaries.\n\n\"No wonder that even the US investors are now looking at the European landscape, which wasn't a thing a year ago,\" Hietala said.\n\nRead this collection to get to know some of the startups seeking a slice of Europe's expanding war chest:",

    "fullText": "A glimpse into Melania Trump's often-obscured personal life has drawn at least some fans to the box office, earning over $7 million during the opening weekend.\n\nData from The Numbers, a movie financial analysis website, shows that \"Melania: Twenty Days to History\" is far and away the highest-grossing documentary of 2026 so far.\n\nOne of the highest-grossing documentaries of 2025 was \"Becoming Led Zeppelin,\" which earned about $10.4 million at the domestic box office.\n\n\"It proves that an original idea which is executed with deliberate beauty is embraced by fans and moviegoers, regardless of political affiliation,\" Marc Beckman, Melania's senior advisor and agent, told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nThe documentary, which premiered on January 30, offers a behind-the-scenes look at the days leading up to President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration from the first lady's perspective. Amazon MGM Studios paid $40 million to license the documentary and an additional docuseries on Prime Video. Brett Ratner, known for the \"Rush Hour\" franchise before sexual misconduct allegations derailed his career in 2017, directed the documentary.\n\n\"With exclusive footage of critical meetings, private conversations, and never-before-seen environments, 'Melania' showcases Mrs. Trump's return to one of the world's most powerful roles,\" an Amazon press release said.\n\nDespite the early box-office sales, the film has earned less-than-stellar reviews from critics and was review-bombed on Letterboxd. Business Insider's Peter Kafka described the documentary as \"dull,\" but said that it could resonate with superfans of the Trump family.\n\n\"The best way I can describe this one is something akin to a wedding video: Maybe the subjects of the video will want to watch it (Melania looks, unsurprisingly, like a woman who used to be a model; her husband seems notably more spry than he does now, a year after it was filmed),\" Kafka wrote. \"It's hard to imagine anyone else will.\"",

    "description": "\"I should spend more time at home, but there's so much to see and do and people to meet that I have a hard time staying home,\" Bill Strayer said.",
    "fullText": "When Bill Strayer first dreamed about moving to Asia, Japan was always the goal.\n\nBorn in Colorado, Strayer went to college in Missouri and later moved to the Bay Area to work in tech. There, work trips across Asia introduced him to cultures he hadn't encountered growing up.\n\nAs an adult, he participated in a homestay program in Japan three times, living with local families.\n\n\"That's what really kicked me into gear for being in Japan,\" Strayer, 63, told Business Insider. \"I studied Japanese, I watched Japanese movies, I listened to Japanese music. I made 14 trips to Japan.\"\n\nAs his career evolved, Strayer accepted a role at a financial services company that eventually brought him to Hawaii.\n\n\"My company had a branch office in Honolulu. I thought, well, Honolulu is kind of on the way to Japan. I'll just stay in Hawaii for two, three years and then eventually make it to Japan,\" Strayer said.\n\nWhat was meant to be a brief stop in Hawaii turned into 24 years, and the move to Japan never materialized.\n\nInstead, Strayer left his job as a portfolio advisor after a few years and eventually started a new chapter in aviation, first flying cargo and later transporting hotel guests between Hawaiian islands.\n\nAnd when it finally came time for him to retire, he moved to Bangkok instead.\n\nWhile Strayer was living in Hawaii, the timing never seemed right for a move to Japan — in his 30s, retirement still felt far off. And his mother had moved to Hawaii full time after years of being a snowbird.\n\nA two-week vacation through Southeast Asia in the early 2000s shifted his attention away from Japan. With just a day and a half in Bangkok, Thailand's capital, he hired a driver to show him around — and fell in love with the city immediately.\n\n\"This is so awesome,\" Strayer said, recalling his reaction. \"So I said, OK, next year I'm spending the whole two weeks in Bangkok. That's what kicked it off.\"\n\nEvery year after that, he would spend his two weeks of vacation in Thailand, learning more about the culture and its people. Over time, a realization set in: Japan was a place he loved to visit, but Thailand felt like somewhere he could actually live, especially since he wasn't a fan of cold weather.\n\n\"There's an extra point for Thailand; I'm not going to see a flake of snow,\" he said.\n\nAfter his mother died in 2021, Strayer decided to move forward with his plans. \"There was no real reason for me to be in Hawaii anymore,\" he said.\n\nAfter retiring from his aviation job in October 2022 and applying for a retirement visa, he returned to Bangkok in May 2023.\n\nStrayer is part of a wider trend of people relocating to Thailand. Bangkok, in particular, has long been a hot spot for expats.\n\nThere were 102,189 foreigners living in the city at the end of 2024, according to the latest Thai government data.\n\nStrayer spent two weeks living in a hotel while looking for an apartment. With the help of a real estate agent, he found a two-bedroom condo about 20 minutes from the city center. Rent is 30,000 Thai baht monthly, or about $950, and he is now in his third year there.\n\nHis furnished apartment is close to the Bangkok Skytrain, making it easy for him to get around.\n\nWith a city so accessible, Strayer has found no shortage of things to do. A typical day starts with a light breakfast, followed by a workout at his apartment complex, before heading out for lunch.\n\n\"I don't cook, because there's so much wonderful food out there on my doorstep that is inexpensive and delicious, far better than I could ever do,\" he said.\n\nA self-described foodie, he enjoys exploring new restaurants, and much of his social circle has grown out of those visits. One of his go-to spots is a small, traditional Thai restaurant that serves home-style dishes.\n\n\"I know the staff, they know me. Sometimes we get together outside of their work and stuff like that. That's been fantastic,\" Strayer said.\n\nMany of his days end with a visit to one of Bangkok's sky bars, where he watches the sunset.\n\n\"I've made it a mission to try to visit as many as I can,\" he said. \"No need to drink alcohol or anything like that, but just go ahead and hang out.\"\n\nEven in retirement, Strayer hasn't fully slowed down. He's been trading the US stock market since the 1990s and still wakes up between 2 and 4 a.m. to do it.\n\nHe's also built a small circle of expat friends in the city, including a Canadian retiree he met at the gym and another he connected with through YouTube, bonded by a shared interest in the stock market.\n\n\"I should spend more time at home, but there's so much to see and do and people to meet that I have a hard time staying home,\" Strayer added.\n\nHe continues to travel between Bangkok and Honolulu about three times a year, mostly to visit friends. But he doesn't see himself returning to Hawaii permanently — at least not for now.\n\n\"I would not have this much fun in the US. I can tell you that right now,\" he said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city? Contact this reporter at agoh@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Set up automatic API key rotation for OpenRouter using Infisical. Complete guide for secure key management and zero-downtime rotation.",
    "fullText": "Infisical is a secrets management platform that helps teams securely store, sync, and rotate secrets across their infrastructure. With Infisical’s OpenRouter integration, you can automatically rotate your API keys on a schedule, ensuring your credentials stay secure with zero-downtime rotation.\n\nBefore setting up API key rotation, you’ll need an OpenRouter Provisioning API key. Provisioning keys are special keys used only for key management operations (create, list, delete keys) and cannot be used for model completion requests.\n\nNavigate to OpenRouter Settings and go to the Provisioning API Keys section. Click Create New Key, complete the key creation flow, and copy the generated Provisioning API key. Store it securely as you’ll need it when creating the Infisical connection.\n\nThe first step is to create an OpenRouter connection in Infisical that will be used to manage your API keys.\n\nIn your Infisical dashboard, navigate to Organization Settings and then App Connections (or the App Connections page in your project). Click Add Connection and choose OpenRouter from the list of available connections.\n\nComplete the form with your OpenRouter Provisioning API Key from the previous step, an optional description, and a name for the connection (for example, “openrouter-production”). After clicking Create, Infisical validates the key against OpenRouter’s API and your connection is ready to use.\n\nFor detailed instructions with screenshots, see Infisical’s OpenRouter Connection documentation.\n\nOnce your connection is set up, you can configure automatic API key rotation.\n\nNavigate to your Secret Manager Project’s Dashboard in Infisical and select Add Secret Rotation from the actions dropdown. Choose the OpenRouter API Key option.\n\nSet up how and when your keys should rotate:\n\nAuto-Rotation Enabled controls whether keys rotate automatically on the interval. Turn this off to rotate only manually or to pause rotation temporarily.\n\nRotate At specifies the local time of day when rotation runs once the interval has elapsed.\n\nRotation Interval sets the interval in days after which a rotation is triggered.\n\nOpenRouter Connection selects the connection (with a Provisioning API key) that will create and delete API keys during rotation.\n\nConfigure the properties of the rotated API keys:\n\nKey name is the display name for the key in OpenRouter (required).\n\nLimit sets an optional spending limit in USD for this key.\n\nLimit reset determines how often the limit resets: daily, weekly, or monthly.\n\nInclude BYOK in limit is an optional setting that controls whether usage from your own provider keys (Bring Your Own Key) counts toward this key’s spending limit. When disabled, only OpenRouter credits are counted. When enabled, BYOK usage is included in the limit.\n\nSpecify the secret name where the rotated API key will be stored. This is the name of the secret in Infisical where the rotated API key value will be accessible.\n\nGive your rotation a name and optional description, then review your configuration and click Create Secret Rotation. Your OpenRouter API Key rotation is now active. The current API key is available as a secret at the mapped path, and rotations will create a new key, switch the active secret to it, then revoke the previous key for zero-downtime rotation.\n\nFor the complete API reference and additional options, see Infisical’s OpenRouter API Key Rotation documentation.\n\nBYOK (Bring Your Own Key) on OpenRouter lets you use your own provider API keys (such as OpenAI or Anthropic) so you pay providers directly while OpenRouter charges a small fee on those requests.\n\nThe Include BYOK in limit option controls whether BYOK usage counts toward your key’s spending limit. When disabled, only OpenRouter credit usage counts toward the limit and BYOK usage is tracked separately. When enabled, usage from your own provider keys is included in the limit, and once the limit is reached, the key is subject to OpenRouter’s rate limits until the next reset.",

    "fullText": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock futures edged lower on Sunday evening as investors turned cautious ahead of a packed week of corporate earnings and economic data, following a pullback in technology shares that was triggered by Microsoft’s results last week.\n\nS&P 500 Futures inched 0.2% lower to 6,955.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.3% to 25,607.75 points by 19:36 ET (01:36 GMT). Dow Jones Futures traded 0.1% lower at 48,984.0 points.\n\nU.S. equities ended last week in the red, with the NASDAQ Composite leading losses as investors reassessed lofty expectations around artificial intelligence spending and returns.\n\nSentiment was dented after Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings update last week, which, while showing continued revenue growth, failed to fully reassure markets about the near-term payoff from heavy investment in AI infrastructure.\n\nThe results weighed on broader technology stocks and revived concerns that big-ticket AI spending may take longer to translate into profits.\n\nAmplifying concerns, a Wall Street Journal report over the weekend said that Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) proposed investment of up to $100 billion in OpenAI has stalled after internal concerns were raised at the chipmaker\n\nAttention now shifts to earnings from other megacap technology firms, which are expected further shape market direction. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is due to report results on Tuesday, with investors closely watching advertising trends, cloud growth, and commentary on AI-related capital expenditure.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will follow on Thursday, with focus on performance at its Amazon Web Services cloud unit and margins in its core retail business.\n\nBeyond earnings, markets are also digesting political and policy developments. President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh as his nominee for Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nInvestors are weighing what a Warsh-led Fed could mean for interest rates, inflation control, and the balance between growth and financial stability, at a time when markets remain sensitive to policy signals.\n\nEconomic data later in the week could further influence rate expectations. The U.S. January employment report, due on Friday, is expected to show steady job growth and a stable unemployment rate.",

    "fullText": "When Vinicius Junior scored the opening goal in Real Madrid's 2–1 win over Rayo Vallecano, the significance of his celebration was impossible to miss.\n\nHe ran towards the crowd, repeatedly kissing the Real badge on his shirt, before raising his arms and urging the supporters to lift the noise inside the stadium.\n\nThroughout the match he continued to engage with the stands, directing his calls for support towards the ultras, who set the tone inside the Bernabeu.\n\nIt felt like an intentional celebration - a chance for him to reaffirm his loyalty to a fan base that has not always returned it.\n\nOver the past few months Vinicius has unquestionably become the player most frequently singled out by sections of the Bernabeu crowd with boos, and he was again subject to hostile whistles on Sunday.\n\nSo why, despite scoring another vital goal, does he continue to divide the Real fanbase?",

    "title": "Scientists discover hidden geometry that bends electrons like gravity",
    "description": "Researchers have discovered a hidden quantum geometry inside materials that subtly steers electrons, echoing how gravity warps light in space. Once thought to exist only on paper, this effect has now been observed experimentally in a popular quantum material. The finding reveals a new way to understand and control how materials conduct electricity and interact with light. It could help power future ultra-fast electronics and quantum technologies.",
    "fullText": "How can information move at incredible speeds, or electricity flow without wasting energy? Answering these questions has pushed scientists and technology companies toward quantum materials, whose behavior is governed by physics at the smallest scales. Building these advanced materials depends on understanding how atoms and electrons behave, an area where many mysteries remain.\n\nNow, researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), working with colleagues at the University of Salerno and the CNR-SPIN Institute (Italy), have made a significant breakthrough. They identified a previously unseen geometric feature inside a quantum material that alters how electrons move, in a way similar to how gravity bends light. The findings, published in Science, point to new possibilities for next-generation quantum electronics.\n\nModern technologies rely on materials with extraordinary performance, many of which arise from quantum physics. This field focuses on matter at microscopic scales, where particles behave in surprising ways. Over the past century, research into atoms, electrons, and photons led to the invention of transistors and the foundation of today's computers.\n\nEven now, scientists continue to uncover quantum effects that challenge established theories. Recent research suggests that when huge numbers of particles interact inside certain materials, a kind of internal geometry can emerge. This structure can redirect electron motion, closely resembling how Einstein's theory of gravity describes the bending of light.\n\nFrom Mathematical Idea to Measured Reality\n\nThis internal structure is known as the quantum metric. It describes the curvature of the quantum space through which electrons travel and influences many microscopic properties of materials. Despite its importance, proving its existence experimentally has been extremely difficult.\n\n''The concept of quantum metric dates back about 20 years, but for a long time it was regarded purely as a theoretical construct. Only in recent years have scientists begun to explore its tangible effects on the properties of matter,'' explains Andrea Caviglia, full professor and director of the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science.\n\nDetecting a Hidden Geometry in Quantum Materials\n\nIn the new study, the research team led by UNIGE, together with Carmine Ortix, associate professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Salerno, detected the quantum metric at the boundary between two oxide materials, strontium titanate and lanthanum aluminate. This interface is already known as a powerful platform for studying quantum behavior.\n\n''Its presence can be revealed by observing how electron trajectories are distorted under the combined influence of quantum metric and intense magnetic fields applied to solids,'' explains Giacomo Sala, research associate in the Department of Quantum Matter Physics at the UNIGE Faculty of Science and lead author of the study.\n\nImplications for Future Technologies\n\nBeing able to observe this effect allows scientists to measure a material's optical, electronic, and transport properties more accurately. The team also found that the quantum metric is a fundamental characteristic of many materials, rather than a rare exception as previously believed.\n\n''These discoveries open up new avenues for exploring and harnessing quantum geometry in a wide range of materials, with major implications for future electronics operating at terahertz frequencies (a trillion hertz), as well as for superconductivity and light-matter interactions,'' concludes Andrea Caviglia.\n\nMaterials provided by Université de Genève.

As has been the case on too many occasions.\n\nAfter Sunday's incidents, many will agree with Murphy.",

    "fullText": "Second T20 international, Pallekele\n\nSri Lanka 189-5 (20.0 overs): Rathnayake 40 (22); Archer 2-42, Jacks 1-24\n\nEngland 173-4 (16.4 overs): Banton 54* (33), Buttler 39 (29); Pathirana 2-47\n\nEngland won by six wickets runs; lead three-match series 2-0\n\nTom Banton whacked an unbeaten half-century as England pulled off a brilliant DLS chase to beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the second T20 international.\n\nThe players had gone off for rain with England 57-2 off 7.2 overs - Phil Salt and Jacob Bethell the batters out - and when they returned the tourists were set a revised DLS target of 168 off 17 overs.\n\nJos Buttler laid the platform with a 29-ball 39 but Harry Brook truly gave England belief during a brutal and breathtaking cameo in Pallekele.\n\nBrook spanked four sixes during a knock of 36 off 12 balls as he seized the initiative only to be caught scooping the slingy Matheesha Pathirana.\n\nWith 38 runs off 33 balls required, Banton played with calculated aggression en route to 54 not out off 33 balls to put England on the brink of victory.\n\nThe match went down to the final over but Sam Curran duly cracked Janith Liyanage for six to wrap up the win with two balls to spare.\n\nSri Lanka had earlier posted a competitive 189-5 after being inserted by England as Pavan Rathnayake top scored with 40 off 22 balls.\n\nPathum Nissanka had set the tone after he and fellow opener Kamil Mishara hammered 35 off the first two overs of the match.\n\nHowever, England's spinners stymied the hosts' attacking intent with controlled spells through the middle overs as Adil Rashid, Liam Dawson and Will Jacks all picked up a wicket apiece.\n\nJofra Archer claimed 2-42 but fellow seamers Jamie Overton and Curran were both expensive and wicketless.\n\nEngland's victory ensured they clinched the series 2-0 with one match left to play before their opening game of the T20 World Cup against Nepal on 8 February.\n\nBanton burst on to the international scene for England in 2019 with some eye-catching performances as a 21-year-old.\n\nA blur of flamboyant strokeplay and powerful ball striking, he was perhaps found wanting when it came to consistency, especially in his previous guise opening.\n\nThere were question marks as to whether he could hack it when under pressure while injuries also checked his progress.\n\nAt the age of 27, and in England's middle order, the Somerset man looks a much more rounded player at home on the global stage.\n\nThis was an innings of tempered aggression and one which was the glue that bound England's chase together.\n\nBanton swept and reverse swept quite beautifully against Sri Lanka's spinners, striking four fours and three sixes.\n\nHe also knew when to play second fiddle - while Brook was going berserk, for example - which showed useful situational awareness.\n\n\"You've got to give yourself a chance to get out there and assess the wicket,\" Banton said at the post-match presentation.\n\n\"Where there's a bit of hold and turn, it's essential to be able to sweep the ball. The Sri Lankan spinners keep it nice and straight so you've got to hit it.\"\n\nHis chance here came courtesy of Ben Duckett nursing a finger injury and England will now have a decision to make for the World Cup.\n\nAnother decent outing in the final T20 on Tuesday and it could be Banton's place in the middle to lose.\n\n\"I think most of my career I've been opening. I've got a new role with England which is exciting,\" Banton added.\n\n\"I just want to try and play all formats and hopefully take my chance when I get it.\"\n\nEncouragingly for England on the eve of a subcontinental T20 World Cup, their spin department is holding up well.\n\nA combined 12 overs yielded three wickets for 81 runs at an economy rate of 6.75, a return that underlined their growing control and reliability.\n\nRashid remains the ace in the pack, capable of stifling momentum and producing breakthroughs at key moments.\n\nThe experienced leg-spinner's googly may have been well studied by opposition batters, but it remains a potent weapon, as Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka discovered when he was trapped lbw slogging to leg.\n\nDawson's left-arm spin provided much-needed control through the middle overs, slowing down his speeds to left vs right handers, while Jacks continues to mature as a bowling option, and used his angles well.\n\nBrook has plenty of options to turn to even when the pitch does not spin big.\n\nA slight concern for England, with just under a week to go before a major tournament, was that their seam bowling did not quite hit the mark.\n\nThat caveat comes with the acknowledgement that the surface at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium was a used one, offering little margin for error.\n\nNevertheless Jamie Overton struggled with his length, while Curran, fresh from an expensive hat-trick in the opening T20, surprisingly lacked conviction after conceding 14 from his first over.\n\nArcher fared slightly better, picking up two wickets despite being targeted early on, with Nissanka launching him out of the ground in his opening over.\n\nArcher, however, recovered well to bowl effectively at the death as Sri Lanka pushed for a total in excess of 200.\n\nEngland captain Harry Brook: \"I thought we played outstanding there, especially with the bat. To win the series is awesome.\n\n\"I think the more time we get out in the middle puts us into good shape for the World Cup. The way Banton played there was great. There's plenty of batters in there. We just go out there and chase.\n\n\"The spinners have been awesome, that's why we decided to pick two frontline spinners, to help restrict those runs in the middle.\"\n\nSri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka: \"We did a lot of things right. It's not the rain, but the fact that Eshan Malinga got injured played a part. Normally he's a very good death bowler but we lost him so there's a reason [for the loss].\n\n\"Every batter got starts so happy about the way they played and accelerated. There were a few overs where we couldn't capitalise but Adil Rashid bowled well.\n\n\"We know that because we've played on spin tracks the past two years. It's the home advantage so no doubt about it we need to use that.\"\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "Yann LeCun, an A.I. Pioneer, Warns the Tech 'Herd' Could Hit a Dead End",
    "description": "Yann LeCun helped create the technology behind today’s chatbots. Now he says many tech companies are on the wrong path to creating intelligent machines.",
    "fullText": "Throughout his 40-year career as a computer scientist, Yann LeCun has earned a reputation as one of the world’s leading experts on artificial intelligence and a man with a penchant for throwing verbal grenades.\n\nHe was one of three pioneering researchers who received the Turing Award, often called “the Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on the technology that is now the foundation for modern A.I. For more than a decade, he also served as chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nBut after leaving Meta in November, Dr. LeCun has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of Silicon Valley’s single-minded approach to building intelligent machines. He argues that the technology industry will eventually hit a dead end in its A.I. development — after years of work and hundreds of billions of dollars spent.\n\nThe reason, he said, goes back to what he has argued for years: Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the A.I. technology at the heart of popular products like ChatGPT, can get only so powerful. And companies are throwing everything they have at projects that won’t get them to their goal to make computers as smart as or even smarter than humans. More creative Chinese companies, he added, could get there first.\n\n“There is this herd effect where everyone in Silicon Valley has to work on the same thing,” he said during a recent interview from his home in Paris. “It does not leave much room for other approaches that may be much more promising in the long term.”\n\nThat critique is the latest shot in a debate that has roiled the tech industry since OpenAI sparked the A.I. boom in 2022 with the release of ChatGPT: Is it possible to create so-called artificial general intelligence or even more powerful superintelligence? And can companies get there using their current technology and concepts?\n\nFew scientists have as much history with the topic as Dr. LeCun, 65. Much of what the tech industry is trying to do now has its roots in an idea that he has nurtured since the 1970s. As a young engineering student in Paris, he embraced a concept called neural networks, even though most researchers thought the idea was hopeless.\n\nNeural networks are mathematical systems that learn skills by analyzing data. At the time, they had no practical use. But a decade later, when he was a researcher at Bell Labs, Dr. LeCun and his colleagues showed that these systems could learn to read handwriting scribbled on envelopes or personal checks.\n\nNot long after ChatGPT was released, the two researchers who received the 2018 Turing Award with Dr. LeCun warned that A.I. was growing too powerful. Those scientists even warned that the technology could threaten the future of humanity. Dr. LeCun argued that was absurd.\n\n“There was a lot of noise around the idea that A.I. systems were intrinsically dangerous and that putting them in the hands of everyone was a mistake,” he said. “But I have never believed in this.”\n\nDr. LeCun also helped push Meta and its rivals to freely share their research through academic-style papers and so-called open source technologies.\n\nAs more people said A.I. could be a threat of some sort to humans, a number of companies curtailed their open source efforts. But Meta kept going. Dr. LeCun repeatedly argued that open source was the safest path. It meant that no one company would control the technology and that anyone could use these systems to identify and fight potential risks.\n\nNow as a number of companies, including Meta, appear to be moving away from that method because they want an edge over their rivals and continue to worry about dangerous uses, Dr. LeCun is warning that American companies could lose their lead to Chinese rivals that are still using open source.\n\n“This is a disaster,” he said. “If everyone is open, the field as a whole progresses faster.”\n\nMeta’s A.I. work ran into a snag last year. After outside researchers criticized the company’s latest technology, Llama 4, and accused Meta of misrepresenting the power of the system, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, spent billions on a new research lab dedicated to the pursuit of “superintelligence” — a hypothetical A.I. system that exceeds the powers of the human brain.\n\nSix months after the creation of the new lab, Dr. LeCun left Meta to build his own start-up, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, or AMI Labs.\n\nEven though his research laid the groundwork for L.L.M.s, Dr. LeCun argued that they were not the final answer to A.I. development. The problem with current systems, he said, is that they do not plan ahead. Trained solely on digital data, they do not have a way of understanding difficulties in the real world.\n\n“L.L.M.s are not a path to superintelligence or even human-level intelligence. I have said that from the beginning,” he said. “The entire industry has been L.L.M.-pilled.”\n\nDuring his last several years at Meta, Dr. LeCun worked on technology that tried to predict the outcome of its actions. That, he said, would allow A.I. to progress beyond the status quo. His new start-up will continue that work.\n\n“This type of system can plan what it is going to do,” he said. “Current systems — L.L.M.s — absolutely cannot do that.”\n\nPart of Dr. LeCun’s argument is that today’s A.I. systems make too many mistakes. As they tackle more complex tasks, he argued, mistakes pile up like cars after a collision on a highway.\n\nBut over the last several years, these systems have steadily improved. And in recent months, the latest models, which are designed to “reason” through questions, have continued to improve in areas like math, science and computer programming.\n\n“These models do make mistakes. But we have shown that a system can try many different options — in its own head, so to speak — before settling on a final answer,” said Rayan Krishnan, the chief executive of Vals AI, a company that tracks the performance of the latest A.I. technologies.\n\n“Progress is not slowing down. It has become clear that language models can take on new tasks and continue to get better at doing everything we want them to do,” he said.\n\nSubbarao Kambhampati, an Arizona State University professor who has been an A.I. researcher nearly as long as Dr. LeCun, agreed that today’s technologies don’t provide a path to true intelligence. But he also pointed out that they were increasingly useful in highly lucrative areas like computer coding. Dr. LeCun’s newer methods, he added, are unproven.\n\nFor Dr. LeCun, that is why his new company is important. The last several decades, he said, are filled with A.I. projects that seemed like a way forward but ran out of steam. And Silicon Valley is not guaranteed to be the winner in this global race.\n\n“The good ideas are coming from China,” he said. “But Silicon Valley also has a superiority complex, so it can’t imagine that good ideas can come from other places.”",

    "fullText": "With transfer deadline day approaching, how does the January window compare to previous years and what could still happen before Monday's 19:00 GMT deadline?\n\nThe current Premier League spending sits at £325m, down from £421m in 2025 - but there's a good chance we might reach a similar final total with a busy deadline day expected.\n\nJanuary 2026 has seen a somewhat middling window. Of the traditional big six, only Manchester City and Tottenham have been active, spending £84m and £48m respectively.\n\nIndeed, Antoine Semenyo's £63m switch from Bournemouth to City looks set to be comfortably the biggest deal done in the window.\n\nCity will be the biggest spenders for the second-consecutive January, having spent £188m 12 months ago on reinforcements that have had varying degrees of impact on the first-team. The £84m outlay on Semenyo and Marc Guehi edges them close to an eye-watering £450m spend in the last 12-month period.\n\nTottenham (£47.8m) and West Ham (£47m) follow next, the latter adding two centre-forwards to their ranks as they look to move out of the relegation zone.\n\nLiverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea have so far chosen to sit this one out, and that's been a prevailing theme for that quartet in January of late; Arsenal and Liverpool have not signed anyone at all in winter for three seasons now, while United's capture of Patrick Dorgu (£27m in 2025) has been their only business over that same period.\n\nChelsea signed Mathis Amougou (£13.5m) last January, otherwise they have transitioned to relying solely on summer business, too.",

Shoot themselves in the foot in a manner that suggested if \"the fun boat\" hit some choppy waters ahead, it would still sail triumphantly into port at the end of the season.\n\nAnd weekends as good as this one will make Arsenal's passage to a first Premier League title since 2004 even smoother.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City's second-half performances are becoming a concern for them, and might just end up costing them in the Premier League title race.\n\nAfter Sunday's collapse from 2-0 up to draw 2-2 against Tottenham, City have now failed to see out three of the past four league games where they have been ahead at half-time.\n\nThe other times they have been pegged back for draws since the turn of the year, at home to Chelsea and Brighton, did not see the same dramatic drop-off in performance as in the second half against Spurs.\n\nHowever, in all three matches they will look back and think they had chances to make the points safe.\n\nThe turnaround at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was down to what both teams were like after the break - a re-energised and fired-up Spurs, with some new personnel and a different system, against what I think was a complacent City side.\n\nTactics do matter here, of course, and Tottenham stopped City playing through them the way they had in the first half - but what made more of a difference for Spurs in their fightback was the way their attitude and desire was much greater than City's.\n\nIn any game, I always believe that if the team with the better players matches the energy, desire and running power of the team with less quality, and wins the important duels, then they will win the game or maintain their lead.\n\nI do not think City lost their way because Spurs suddenly had more quality than them - it was more that Tottenham just wanted it \n\nThat is a concern for Pep Guardiola, especially because his team are trying to put pressure on leaders Arsenal.",

Michael Carrick's post-match assessment summed up the view of many.\n\nBenjamin Sesko is entitled to the headlines after delivering the dramatic ending.\n\nBut when the dust settles on the 3-2 win over Fulham, United fans may start to look back further to Ruben Amorim's ill-fated 14 months in charge and wonder whether their club effectively wasted a year.\n\nAmorim presided over victories like this.\n\nThe 5-4 epic against Lyon in the Europa League last April was even more dramatic given it involved two goals in the final minute of extra time.\n\nGo back further and Carrick played in them. He was an injury-time substitute before Michael Owen scored his famous Manchester derby winner at Old Trafford in 2009.\n\n\"It's the best feeling,\" said Carrick.\n\n\"Some of the best moments here I've been lucky enough to be a part of, when you get a moment of elation and excitement like that.\n\n\"There's no better place, in front of the Stretford End - and it ends up meaning a bit more.\n\n\"People leave here with more than just a United win. It puts layers on top of that through the connection and the emotion. It's why we all love it so much.\n\n\"That excitement is part of this club. It's not always the easiest way.

    "description": "Plus, how to whip up the best morning meal for your gut.",
    "fullText": "All of our meals and snacks affect our health on a short-term basis. When eaten regularly, they also impact our bodies (for better or worse) down the line. However, one gastroenterologist has a special love of breakfast, especially when it comes to his patients' gut health and his own.\n\n\"Think of your breakfast as the opening act for your gut's entire day,\" shares Dr. Rosario Ligresti, MD, the chief ofthe division of gastroenterology at Hackensack University Medical Center. \"What you eat first thing in the morning sets the stage for your digestive system's rhythm and your gut microbiome's activity.\"\n\nDr. Ligresti says well-balanced breakfasts stabilize blood sugar levels, prevent energy crashes and lower the odds that you'll get a hankering for less nutritious, sugary snacks later. Speaking of later, we're not fans of potty talk at the breakfast table. That said, good breakfast habits can lead to good bathroom habits, so you're less likely to get constipated.\n\n\"Essentially, a good breakfast habit tells your gut, 'We're starting the day strong and nourished,' which can lead to better energy, focus and overall digestive wellness throughout the day,\" he explains.\n\nWhat qualifies as a good breakfast, though? To help, Dr. Ligresti shares the one breakfast mistake he wishes people would stop making and delicious ways to break the habit.\n\n🩺\nDr. Ligresti wishes people would stop skipping or deprioritizing fiber and protein in the morning. \"Protein and fiber are the power couple of a gut-healthy breakfast, and I can't recommend them enough,\" he tells Parade.\n\nIndeed, fiber is getting billed as the new protein these days. However, trend forecasters can take a seat because there's plenty of room for both fiber and protein at the breakfast table. Unfortunately, many sugary cereals and other traditional breakfast foods are low in both of these nutrients, and that's a problem.\n\nLet's start with fiber. It's not a standalone macro nutrient like protein is, though complex carbohydrates like whole-wheat breads and pastas contain fiber. Regardless, fiber can have a macro effect on your overall health, especially your digestive tract. Fewer than 10% of Americans get enough fiber daily, though, and it's not doing their guts any good.\n\n\"When you consume fiber, it acts like a broom for your digestive tract, adding bulk to your stool, which helps with regularity and prevents constipation,\" Dr. Ligresti explains. \"Furthermore, certain fibers are prebiotics, meaning they are food for the beneficial bacteria in your gut, helping to create a diverse and thriving gut microbiome.\"\n\nWhether the spotlight on protein is on dimming remains to be seen. However, he hopes that people continue to prioritize the macronutrient every morning. \"Protein, on the other hand, is crucial for making you feel full and satisfied, which helps to curb overeating later in the day.\"\n\nIn short? Protein and fiber are not rivals. They are two of your gut's best friends.\n\n\"Having these two nutrients together at breakfast provides you with sustained energy, supports muscle health, and keeps your blood sugar stable for hours,\" Dr. Ligresti says.\n\nSpeaking of hours, they're at the heart of why many people don't get enough fiber and protein at breakfast. There simply aren't enough of them in the day. \"In our fast-paced lives, time is often the biggest reason people skip a nutrient-dense breakfast,\" he states. \"It's much quicker to grab a pastry, a sugary cereal, or just a cup of coffee on the way out the door.\"\n\nAs convenient and tasty as these options are, Dr. Ligresti explains they are low in protein and fiber and high in refined sugars and unhealthy fats. \"In the short term, these foods can cause a rapid spike and subsequent crash in your blood sugar, leading to fatigue and more cravings,\" he reports. \"They can also contribute to uncomfortable symptoms like bloating and gas.\"\n\nOver time, he says eating these foods at breakfast or any time of day consistently might alter your gut microbiome, potentially leading to inflammation and a greater risk of developing other chronic health issues.\n\nReady to help your gut health rise with a breakfast that consistently shines? Dr. Ligresti shares three time-saving breakfasts rich in fiber and protein.\n\nGreek yogurt with berries and nuts. This easy-to-assemble breakfast idea is a win for your schedule and gut health. \"The Greek yogurt provides a fantastic source of protein, the berries are loaded with fiber and antioxidants, and the nuts add more fiber and healthy fats for sustained energy,\" he says.\n\nOatmeal with chia seeds and an apple. You definitely don't have to ditch all of the classics, especially not oatmeal. \"Oatmeal...is rich in soluble fiber, which is great for heart health and keeping you full,\" he says. \"I like to stir in some chia seeds for an extra boost of fiber and omega-3s, and top it with sliced apples for some sweetness and crunch.\"\n\nScrambled eggs with spinach on whole-wheat toast. Savory tooths, rejoice. \"The eggs are a complete protein, and adding spinach provides extra vitamins and fiber,\" Dr. Ligresti shares. \"Serving it on a slice of whole-wheat toast ensures you're getting that essential fiber to start your day right.\"\n\nGetting enough protein and fiber is a great first step toward better gut health. However, Dr. Ligresti shares that there are other important strategies to implement to keep your gut happy. He recommends:\n\nDr. Ligresti always tells patients to sip water throughout the day to help prevent constipation and support their overall gut health. \"Water is essential for helping fiber do its job of moving things smoothly through your digestive system,\" he says.\n\n\"Fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi and sauerkraut are rich in probiotics, which are live beneficial bacteria that can help support a healthy gut microbiome,\" he explains. If you don't normally consume these foods, he suggests starting with a small serving of one of these ideas each day.\n\nHe points out that there's a strong brain-gut connection, and chronically high stress can throw things out of whack. \"High levels of stress can negatively impact your digestion,\" Dr. Ligresti says. \"I encourage my patients to find a daily stress-reducing activity they enjoy, whether it's a short walk, meditation or simply reading a book.\"\n\nDr. Rosario Ligresti, MD, the chief ofthe division of gastroenterology at Hackensack University Medical Center\n\nClosing America’s Fiber Intake Gap.

The complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a misconduct complaint filed by the Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald Trump ’s administration over deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe complaint against U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg was dismissed on Dec. 19 by Jeffrey S. Sutton, chief judge of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals but the order only came to light this weekend.\n\nThe complaint stemmed from remarks that Boasberg, the chief judge in the district court in the nation’s capital, allegedly made in March 2025 to Chief Justice John Roberts and other federal judges at a judicial conference saying the administration would trigger a constitutional crisis by disregarding federal court rulings. The meeting took place days before Boasberg issued an order blocking deportation flights that Trump was carrying out by invoking wartime authorities from an 18th century law.\n\nIn the dismissal order, Sutton said the Justice Department never provided a listed attachment to provide proof of what Boasberg said or the context of the alleged statement at the closed-door conference.\n\n“A recycling of unadorned allegations with no reference to a source does not corroborate them. And a repetition of uncorroborated statements rarely supplies a basis for a valid misconduct complaint,\" said Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to the appeals court circuit that covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.\n\nSpokespeople for the Justice Department and for Boasberg's court did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nEven if Boasberg had made the comments, Sutton said it would not be “so far afield\" from topics discussed at the gathering and would not violate ethics rules. Sutton noted that Roberts' 2024 year-end report raised general concerns about threats to judicial independence, security concerns for judges and respect for court orders throughout the nation's history.\n\nThe misconduct complaint was filed with Judge Sri Srinivasan, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but Srinivasan asked Roberts to transfer it to another appeals court circuit because it was still considering appeals related to the deportation case, according to the dismissal order. Roberts transferred it to the 6th Circuit, it said.",

    "description": "“All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food.\"",
    "fullText": "Plastic pollution is an enormous global problem, and a lot of focus has been rightly placed on the devastating effects that plastic is having on our oceans and marine life. But plastic pollution on land is a big problem, too, as experts have recently been reminded when they started discovering giant blobs of the stuff inside the stomachs of dead camels.\n\nCalifornia-based environmental scientist Marcus Eriksen and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based veterinary microbiologist Ulrich Wernery co-authored an article titled \"The plight of camels eating plastic waste.\"\n\nEriksen described one autopsy as \"the most surreal thing in the world,\" and their findings showed that plastic clumps called polybezoars, which Eriksen said \"range from the size of a basketball to roughly a large suitcase,\" are responsible for 1% of the camel deaths in the UAE\n\n\"All [camels] know in the desert [is] if it's not sand, it's food,\" Eriksen said. \"If they see a plastic bag stuck in a tree … or stuck against a fence, they might think, 'Oh, that's a novel piece of food,' and they'll consume it.\"\n\nThe effects of eating plastic are devastating for the camels, causing intestinal blockages, creating lacerations inside their stomachs, and creating a toxic environment for bacteria to grow amid the folds of the plastic.\n\n\"It's a slow death,\" Eriksen said. \"Imagine if you had five plastic bags crushed up in your body, and maybe a dozen bottle caps and a few straws, and it stayed there for years. I mean, you would suffer until you'd ultimately perish from that ingested trash. And that's what the camels are experiencing.\"\n\nCamels are not the only land animals facing this challenge, either. A sick bear in Colorado was recently euthanized and found to have plastic waste blocking its digestive system. Plastic waste consumption also killed two elephants in Sri Lanka.\n\nAs plastic waste causes more and more animal deaths, there is some hope that public pressure will cause governments to regulate it more heavily. Canada banned single-use plastics in 2021, and other places, such as Massachusetts, have taken similar steps.\n\nAs far as steps we can take to reduce our plastic consumption in our regular lives, we can make sure we understand how to recycle as effectively as possible and shun single-use plastics by using things like reusable water bottles.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the coolest innovations improving our lives and saving our planet.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s jokes at an elite closed-door Washington, D.C., event bombed so badly that “the room fell silent repeatedly,” The Washington Post reported Sunday.\n\nThe awkwardness happened Saturday night at the Alfalfa Club dinner, an invitation-only event for some 200 of the rich and powerful who gather together each year on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee’s birthday.\n\nAccording to The Post, it was the first time Trump addressed the club, “speaking before a room whose membership includes such foes as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon (whose bank he is suing), David Rubenstein (whom he fired as head of the Kennedy Center) and Jerome H. Powell (the outgoing Fed chairman whose role he is investigating).”\n\nAn anonymous source told The Post that some of Trump’s jokes “landed with a thud, and the room fell silent repeatedly.”\n\nTrump began his remarks by declaring, “So many people in the room I hate. Most of you I like,” Trump said, before adding, “Who in the hell thought this was going to happen?”\n\nTrump then warned the crowd that he might “cut the speech short” so he could watch “the invasion of Greenland,” before revealing that he was just joking.\n\n“We’re not going to invade Greenland. We’re going to buy it,” Trump said, according to the report. “It’s never been my intention to make Greenland the 51st state. I want to make Canada the 51st state. Greenland will be the 52nd state. Venezuela can be 53rd.”\n\nTrump dropped several off-color comments about his political adversaries, according to attendees. He described calling Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) “Pocahontas” in reference to her claims of Native American heritage. She was supposed to be at the dinner, he said, “but couldn’t find her reservation.” He mentioned that Condoleezza Rice was also in the audience and said he always thought she would be the first female president. “Never in a million years would I have thought Joe Biden would beat her to it,” he added, suggesting that former first lady Jill Biden was the true president in a barb that also appeared to bomb with guests.\n\nAfter the event, Trump flew to his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, FL, for White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino’s wedding, scheduled to be held Sunday.\n\nThe post Trump Reportedly Bombed His Speech at Closed-Door Black Tie DC Dinner: ‘Jokes Landed With a Thud’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "If someone is a millionaire, there are usually signs beyond the number in their bank account. If you are trying to get on the wealth-building path to reach millionaire status, you may need to adopt habits, values and financial strategies that represent true wealth.\n\nMoving from aspiring to having actual riches takes noticeable shifts in your behavior around money management, especially when it comes to your spending and savings habits. Identifying these ways to edit is important because they show not just where financial success is possible but also a mindset that’s focused on lasting wealth creation.\n\nSimply put, if you’re looking for clues on how to be rich, you might want to do as a millionaire does. Here are some key signs you are making the financial decisions they would.\n\nA diversified investment portfolio is a hallmark of a millionaire. This portfolio typically extends beyond stocks and bonds, toward encompassing real estate, business ventures and perhaps alternative investments like art or private equity.\n\nWhen you are saving for retirement or a big-ticket item, diversification isn’t a random act of finance. It’s a strategic approach to spread risk and maximize returns by avoiding putting all of your nest eggs in one basket.\n\nRead Next: 5 Key Mindset Shifts To Financially Become the Top 1%, According to Humphrey Yang\n\nLearn More: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n\nAnother key sign of a millionaire is making strategic financial planning and investment decisions. Your goal isn’t just about saving money but rather creating a comprehensive roadmap for earning, saving, investing and spending. Millionaires understand that a well-thought-out financial strategy is crucial for wealth accumulation and preservation.\n\nRobust savings and substantial emergency funds are common among millionaires. They understand the importance of having a safety net that should have at least three to six months’ worth of expenses in it to cover you should something unexpected happen, such as medical bills or job loss.\n\nUnlike the average person, a millionaire’s emergency fund can cover a year or more of living expenses, ensuring financial stability even in unforeseen circumstances.\n\nMillionaires typically have a low debt-to-income ratio. This means they are cautious about borrowing and prioritize paying off debts quickly.\n\nThough this may seem easier for those not living paycheck to paycheck, someone comfortable with their finances tends to focus on accumulating assets, not liabilities, indicating a healthy approach to debt management.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nWhen I start working with a new senior client, the first exercise I introduce to them is the wall plank.\n\nThis simple exercise is great for strengthening the deepest muscles in our core, which are responsible for supporting the back and hips, maintaining proper posture, and stabilizing the entire body.\n\nAnd because muscle mass, bone density and balance all diminish as we age, having good deep core strength is all the more important for preventing injuries and falls.\n\nThe wall plank is appropriate for all fitness levels, easy to modify or progress, and safe to do every day. As long as you have a section of bare wall and a few minutes to spare, you can give wall planks a try.\n\nCheck in with your doctor before starting any new activity. A certified trainer can provide form guidance and exercise modification, if needed.\n\nStand facing a wall, position yourself about six inches away from it with your feet hip-width apart.\n\nLean forward and place your forearms against the wall, making sure your elbows, forearms and shoulders are aligned.\n\nYour body should form a straight line from your head to your feet, don’t allow your hips to pop back or sink towards the wall.\n\nGently push the muscles in your midsection out to engage your core muscles and keep them braced throughout.\n\nHold for the desired length of time.\n\nStart by holding the wall plank for 15 seconds, incrementally working your way up to 60 seconds over subsequent workouts. Beginners should aim to do one set of wall planks two to three times a week. Once you’ve built up the appropriate amount of strength, aim for two to three sets of wall planks, five to seven times a week.\n\nMake it easier: If this exercise feels tough, modify by placing your hands against the wall instead of your elbows, or by placing your feet closer to the wall.\n\nMake it harder: Make the exercise more challenging by walking your feet further away from the wall. Once you’re able to hold the wall plank for 60 seconds with good form, consider trying the plank on a lower elevated surface, like a chair or your bed.\n\nStandard planks performed lying face down on a yoga mat are one of the best exercises to target the transverse abdominis, a deep-lying muscle in the core that stabilizes and supports your spine and pelvis.\n\nDeep core strength is especially important for seniors, because age-related changes can jeopardize overall balance and stability.\n\nUnfortunately, injuries or mobility issues can make it difficult for many seniors to do exercises on the floor. Wall planks are done standing upright instead, engaging the transverse abdominis in a similar way to standard planks.",

    "fullText": "Argentine cherry growers are facing a challenging season with severe rain and hailstorms. Production and exports have fallen due to this change in climate. The damaged crop has threatened global food supplies and farmers' livelihoods.\n\nEurofruit reported that poor weather caused Argentine cherry shipments in the last quarter of 2025 to hit a low.\n\nPlanet protection agency SENASA confirmed that cherry shipments totaled 3,760 tonnes (over 4,100 tons). This is a 38% decrease from last year and 19% below the five-year average.\n\nThe \"sector [is] on course for its worst season since 2019,\" per the report.\n\nGrowers projected good-quality crops to exceed last year's totals.\n\nAccording to Eurofruit, rain and hailstorms damaged \"the main producing areas\" instead. Much of the crop went to the domestic market.\n\nShifts in export markets are also happening in the 2025/26 season. Despite the drop in volumes, the U.S. is becoming the top destination (36%), while China's share fell (26%).\n\nBad weather in Argentine cherry production indicates how an overheating planet impacts crops. Farming communities and importing countries rely on crops for food and to support their economies.\n\nFrequent extreme weather events, which have been increasing, damage agricultural yields.

You could make a negotiated deal that would be satisfactory with no nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTehran says it is ready for \"fair\" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.\n\nThe protests, which started over economic hardships but morphed ⁠into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its ​establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.\n\nOfficial numbers put the unrest-related death ​toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.\n\nIn a symbolic shift in response to ‍the crackdown on protests, the European ⁠Union on Thursday designated the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn retaliation on Sunday, Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said EU armies would also be designated as such, and that authorities would deliberate on the expulsion of EU ⁠states' military attachés.\n\n\"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot\" the speaker told fellow lawmakers, who all wore IRGC ‌uniforms in support of the elite force.\n\nAfter his address, lawmakers shouted \"Death to America, Shame on you Europe\".",

At the 2008 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Buffett was asked, \"If you were 30 years old again and had your first million in the bank, how would you invest it assuming you're not a full-time investor, you have another full-time job, you can cover your expenses with other savings for about 18 months, and you have no dependents.\" \"I'll be very simple,\" he repli",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett isn't known for overcomplicating things—and when it comes to investing, he doesn't think you should either.\n\nAt the 2008 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Buffett was asked, \"If you were 30 years old again and had your first million in the bank, how would you invest it assuming you're not a full-time investor, you have another full-time job, you can cover your expenses with other savings for about 18 months, and you have no dependents.\"\n\n\"I'll be very simple,\" he replied. \"Under the conditions you name, I'd probably have it all in a very low-cost index fund… somebody I knew was reliable, somebody where the cost was low.\" Then came the part many people overlook: \"I'd forget it and go back to work.\"\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nThat part isn't just practical—it's the whole philosophy. Buffett wasn't advising someone to watch the markets or make investing a second job. He was saying to get on with life. Keep earning. Let compound interest take the wheel. With steady income and decades ahead, the real advantage isn't perfect timing—it's not touching the money at all. When the plan is simple and automatic, the hardest part is knowing when to leave it alone.\n\nBuffett has long maintained that most investors shouldn't try to beat the market. It's not about intelligence—it's about realism. He doesn't just invest in companies—he buys entire businesses, with full access to management, operations, and long-term strategy. That's not something the average investor can replicate.\n\nInstead, he recommends simplicity and discipline. A low-cost index fund—like one that tracks the S&P 500—spreads your money across hundreds of large U.S. companies. There's no guesswork involved. You're not betting on the next Apple or Amazon. You're owning a slice of the entire market and letting it grow over time.\n\nTrending: This ETF issuer isn't chasing the index — it's building tools for income, leverage, and conviction\n\nAt Berkshire's 2020 shareholders meeting, Buffett doubled down on the same principle. \"I don't think most people are in a position to pick single stocks,\" he said. \"A few [are], maybe, but on balance, I think people are much better off buying a cross-section of America and just forgetting about it.\"",

    "fullText": "More than 5,200 members of the United Educators of San Francisco voted overwhelmingly to authorize the union’s leadership to call a strike as teachers push for more public education funding.\n\nThe union, which represents San Francisco Unified School District workers such as educators, nurses, counselors, and psychologists, voted in favor by 97.6% to pave the way for a potential strike.\n\n“Our community is standing with us in our fight for the consistent classroom teachers, special education supports, and stable programs our students and families need and deserve,” UESF wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.\n\nThe post said the school district was placing money into savings accounts and contracting out work to traveling psychologists or non-district special education support staff.\n\nThe last time San Francisco educators went on strike was in 1979, according to the union. The strike lasted for seven weeks.\n\nThe union didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday via email.\n\nIn a post on Sunday, the San Francisco Unified School District's Superintendent Maria Su said they \"remain committed to negotiating in good faith with UESF and working toward an agreement that supports our students, educators, and school communities.\"\n\nA special Board of Education meeting is scheduled for Wednesday that will focus on labor negotiations, which includes a resolution that would allow the superintendent to make \"necessary operational decisions in the event of a strike,\" the post said.\n\nThe strike authorization vote came on the same day as educators in Southern California also signaled they were gearing up to head to the picket lines to demand better pay and working conditions.\n\nUnited Teachers Los Angeles members also gave their leadership authorization to call a strike. Another union — Local 99 of Service Employees International Union — that represents educators in Southern California is also scheduled to vote on whether to authorize a strike starting on Monday.\n\nA.

    "fullText": "HONG KONG/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit to China is the latest win Beijing can tout in its rivalry with Washington, but the deals he brings back to London also show the limits of the balancing act that middle powers may try to play.\n\nHe follows Canadian counterpart Mark ​Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with ‌allies.\n\nEuropean leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.\n\n\"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done ‌by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States,\" said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.\n\nFrom the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nBut these are \"superficial gestures amid stalled global growth,\" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.\n\n\"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China,\" she said. \"They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries.\"\n\nAnd they ⁠benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China ‌as the world's \"reliable partner\", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.\n\n\"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world,\" Quelch added.\n\nSTARMER SCORES WINS ON VISAS, WHISKY\n\nThe deals clinched by Western powers on such ‍visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.\n\nOn his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.\n\nHe got nothing beyond \"frank dialogue\" on tension arising from China's ​increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.\n\nBritish and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations ‌of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.\n\nSimilarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.\n\nAnd even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing, after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.\n\nCHINA'S EXPORT-DRIVEN GROWTH POSES RISKS FOR WEST\n\nChina's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.\n\nIts trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.\n\nSuch a ⁠pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and ​the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.\n\nIts exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% ​more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.\n\n\"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China,\" said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\"China hardly provides a safe harbour for ‍countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects ⁠of U.S. tariffs,\" added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.\n\nStill, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.\n\nResetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.\n\nThe Asian ⁠giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.\n\nThe visits by Starmer and Carney are \"a propaganda coup for Beijing,\" said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, \"This is not a ‌pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing.\"\n\nHe added, \"No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Liangping Gao ‌and Kevin Yao in Beijing and David Kirton in Shenzhen; Writing by Marius Zaharia; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",

    "fullText": "Emily Beutner, the daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner, died on Jan. 6\n\nThe 22-year-old college student died at the hospital after she was found seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” by a highway in Palmdale, Calif.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said\n\nThe 22-year-old daughter of Los Angeles mayoral candidate Austin Beutner has died after seemingly experiencing a medical emergency. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.\n\nEmily Beutner died on Jan. 6 after she was spotted seemingly “suffering a medical emergency” on the side of the highway in Palmdale, Calif., shortly after 12 a.m. local time, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) said in a press release obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nA witness in the area — the intersection of Sierra Highway and Technology Drive — had alerted authorities to a woman in a “state of medical distress,” Lt. Michael Modica told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe politician’s daughter was treated at the scene and transported to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, according to the LASD.\n\nLASD homicide investigators “responded and assumed control of the death investigation,” the sheriff’s department said. Speaking with the Times, however, Modica warned that this should not be taken as an indication of Emily’s cause of death, as this is typical for a young person found dead in a situation like this one.\n\nAs of Feb. 1, the cause of death has not yet been determined, with Emily’s case remaining open, according to Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office records viewed by PEOPLE.\n\nAustin shared a statement with the Times in the wake of his daughter’s death.\n\n“My family has experienced the unimaginable loss of our beloved daughter,” the mayoral candidate said. “We ask for privacy and your prayers at this time.”\n\nEmily is one of four adult children Austin shares with his wife, Virginia, according to his campaign website. She was a junior at Loyola Marymount University (LMU), where she was studying studio arts, according to a statement shared by the university in the wake of her death.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“Please join me in extending our deepest condolences to Emily’s family and loved ones, and in holding Emily and all who are grieving her loss in our collective thoughts and prayers,” said LMU President Thomas Poon.\n\nPoon also said that the L.A.-based private university will honor Emily with a plaque at its student memorial.\n\nAustin’s opponent in the mayoral race, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, also issued a statement following Emily’s death.\n\n“I am profoundly saddened by the news of the tragic passing of Austin Beutner’s daughter,” Bass said. “There is no way to describe the depth of pain experienced by parents who have lost a child. My heart is broken for the Beutner family, and I offer Austin, his wife Virginia, and their entire family my deepest condolences.\"\n\n\"I will hold them close in my heart,” the mayor’s statement continued, “and I am ready to assist the family with whatever they might need.”",
