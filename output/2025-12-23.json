    "fullText": "Fantasy RB Handcuff Rankings Week 17: New opportunity for Rhamondre Stevenson, Browns backfield depleted, Tyjae Spears shines originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMany fantasy football managers continue to fade the top options at running back in the early rounds, instead opting to deploy strategies including Zero-RB, where you punt the position for at least four rounds or through the top 20 or so options at average draft position (ADP).\n\nRegardless of whether you're trying Zero-RB, Hero RB (one major RB drafted in the first half of the draft), or Robust RB (old-school approach of going heavy on the position), knowing the backups to chase and stash in your draft and on the waiver wire is a necessary step.\n\nEnter the fantasy RB handcuff grid, where we track depth chart movement among every NFL backfield and itemize how it influences each team's fantasy football backfield picture during the season.\n\nKeep scrolling to see where every NFL running back group stands. We will update this every week throughout the season.\n\nHere's the key for symbols used in the fantasy NFL RB handcuffs grid:\n\nFantasy RB1: The top back in name for that team's backfield\n\nTop Handcuff: The likely next in line should an injury or coach's decision remove the RB1. Though it's not always a direct replacement of the role, this column lists the best bet to have more volume in place of the established RB1.\n\nSleepers & Role Players: The first name(s) listed are the most intriguing dart throws in the backfield if you need to dig deeper.\n\nWW: Waiver-wire pickup this week\n\nTrevor Etienne, Jonathon Brooks 🏥 PUP-R\n\nHunter Luepke, Phil Mafah 🏥 IR\n\nTyler Badie, J.K. Dobbins IR 🏥\n\nChris Brooks, MarShawn Lloyd 🏥 IR-R\n\nBrashard Smith, Elijah Mitchell\n\nZavier Scott, Cam Akers, Ty Chandler 🏥,\n\nVelus Jones Jr., Kendre Miller 🏥 IR\n\nBraelon Allen 🏥 IR-R, Kene Nwangwu\n\nIsaac Guerendo, Sincere McCormick, Jordan James 🏥\n\nJulius Chestnut, Kalel Mullings 🏥 IR-R,\n\nThis Top 50 list of the best backup running backs to draft may include some overlap from ongoing RB competitions, but this ideally would be a list of direct backups to draft or pick up off the waiver wire.\n\nAssume PPR value for these handcuffs, but the rankings can be considered universal.\n\nSee which RB handcuff pickups we recommend in our Week 15 waiver wire.\n\nWith TreVeyon Henderson potentially missing Week 17, Rhamondre Stevenson becomes a potential league-winning start in your championship week.\n\nQuinshon Judkins, unfortunately, suffered a brutal leg injury in Week 16. Now, if Dylan Sampson cannot return, Raheim Sanders could provide a viable performance in Week 17.\n\nAudric Estime was nowhere to be found behind the work of Taysom Hill. It was not Evan Hull that Estime owners had to worry about, but the TE/QB/RB hybrid in Hill.\n\nTyjae Spears was insanely impressive in Week 16. It's risky, but there is an argument to start Spears in Week 17.\n\nHandcuff RBs are extremely valuable in fantasy football leagues. They are backup running backs for real-life NFL teams who would be in line to produce big fantasy stats should the starting RB suffer an injury, be the target of an opposing coach's decision for playing time, or miss games for any other reason.\n\nTherefore, drafting these handcuff running backs in the middle and late rounds of fantasy drafts -- and targeting them on the fantasy waiver wire -- is a popular, proactive move that could increase your chances of making your league's playoffs and winning a fantasy title.\n\nFor example, take top-ranked running back Bijan Robinson for the Atlanta Falcons. Should he suffer an injury and miss time his backup is Tyler Allgeier.\n\nDue to his skill set -- a big, bruising back who's also mobile -- and his head coach Raheem Morris' high opinion of his performance, Allgeier would be in line to assume a volumnious workload for every game Robinson misses.\n\nLucking into situations like this requires preparation, which means drafting and adding (\"stashing\") running backs who could explode in value with an increased opportunity.\n\nPaying attention to these RB handcuff rankings provides fantasy players with opportunities to improve their teams with forward-thinking player strategy.",

The couple make great teammates in life and on the pitch, play together in the delayed 2021 Rugby World Cup, competing on the same team in the Six Nations Championship, and battling it out side-by-side at the 2025 World Cup games.\n\nTeammates Leia Brebner-Holden and Elis Martin play together for Loughborough Lightning and at the 2025 Rugby World Cup, but they used to be rivals when Brebner-Holden was playing for Gloucester-Hartpury and Martin was competing for Loughborough Lightning without her.\n\nWelsh rugby players Jasmine Joyce-Butchers and Alisha Joyce-Butchers got married in 2023, and at the beginning of 2025, they started their IVF journey. Now, the happy couple, who play together for the Bristol Bears, is expecting their first child in November.\n\nNot only are rugby stars Kayleigh Powell and Lucy Burgess dating, but they used to both play for the Bristol Bears, and now they’re competing together for the Harlequins.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Pride: 42 lesbian sports power couples who are winning at life and love\n\n10 lesbian sports movies that are total game-changers\n\n20 Super Hot Gay Athletes Who Make Us Sweat\n\n'Matilda' star Mara Wilson goes viral for scathing critique of Trump's trans sports ban​",

    "description": "Paris St-Germain were told they must hand over a £1.3m \"ethics bonus\" to Kylian Mbappe as part of his court battle win - what are these payments?",
    "fullText": "Kylian Mbappe is set to become 60m euros (£52.5m) richer after winning a battle for unpaid salary and bonuses against his former club Paris St-Germain.\n\nOne aspect of Mbappe's legal victory raised eyebrows - PSG were told they must hand over 1.5m euros (£1.3m) in \"ethics bonus\" payments to the France forward.\n\nFor football fans in the UK an ethics bonus might sound a little strange, but in France it is a normal part of a professional athlete's contract.\n\nThe \"ethics bonus\" has made headlines before, primarily when details of Neymar's PSG contract were revealed by Spanish newspaper El Mundo.\n\nThe Brazil forward's deal stipulated a monthly ethics payment of 541,680 euros (£475,876). For Mbappe the bonus was worth 500,000 euros (£438,000) a month.\n\nReports picked up on clauses that required Neymar to show \"courtesy, friendliness and availability to supporters\". He was also expected to \"greet fans before and after each game\".\n\nThe truth behind the ethics bonus is very different.\n\nIn English football, clubs are able to fine a player up to two weeks' wages for a misdemeanour.\n\nFrench law forbids any deductions from a worker's salary. Sports teams therefore make a small portion of it an ethics bonus. The base wage and the ethics bonus are in effect a player's total salary.\n\nIn 2021 it was claimed in some reports that Neymar received extra money for clapping the fans, but the details paint a different picture.\n\nNeymar was expected to behave responsibly to sponsors and referees. He had to turn up to training on time and was barred from placing bets. In effect, it was a moral code.\n\n\"Clubs are very keen to protect their image,\" football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport.\n\n\"They don't want anybody going nuclear and criticising the club, which means that they call them good behaviour clauses.\n\n\"We saw similar with Tiger Woods and Lance Armstrong [who had morals clauses with sponsors]. So behavioural clauses are quite common within sport.\"\n\nIn 2018, Marco Verratti had part of his ethics bonus withheld after being caught drink-driving.\n\nHatem Ben Arfa also lost the bonus when he failed to attend PSG's mid-season training camp in Qatar.\n\nIn 2023, Lionel Messi was punished by PSG after making an unauthorised trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nRugby union club Racing 92 took action against winger Teddy Thomas by \"retaining his ethics bonus for February\" after an incident following a Six Nations match between France and Scotland.\n\nBonuses are now a large part of a player's contract. They cover loyalty payments, received each year on the anniversary of a player joining a club, through to image rights and goal bonuses.\n\n\"The contract which used to be written on the back of a napkin is now an investment by a series of stakeholders,\" Maguire said.\n\n\"You've got the club, you've got the agent, you've got the management company, you've got the player. And quite often the player's intellectual property rights company as well.\n\n\"I've seen some of the big six contracts, and there are 25% uplifts for Champions League participation.\"\n\nThe world's best players are in such high demand they could earn huge top-ups through their image rights, as high as \"60% basic and another 40% on top of that\", Maguire added.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "Speaking after Everton’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, Toffees boss David Moyes told the media he believed his team were up against the best midfielder in the world on the night in Declan Rice.\n\n“[Tim Iroegbunam] was up against probably the best midfield player in the world in some ways,” Moyes said. “Declan developed himself, it’s not down to me, Declan was always going to be a great player. Mikel’s made him into a real top player.\n\n“He’s a great boy, more than anything, he’s a terrific boy, and because of that it’ll give him a great chance. [But he’s] a great player as well. Lots of top attributes.”\n\nMoyes and Rice obviously worked together during their respective spells with West Ham United, and the now-Everton boss has never denied how highly he rates the England international.\n\nEven before Saturday’s game, Moyes reiterated that he thinks Rice was worth much more than the £100m plus £5m bonuses that Arsenal paid.\n\n“I genuinely meant it at the time, I thought Declan was £150m,” Moyes said. “I thought we didn’t get enough at West Ham. We had offered Declan huge contracts but we couldn’t get him to stay. So the club had to do what they had to do.\n\n“I’m still in touch with him. I am going to abuse him today maybe!”\n\nRice certainly put in a good performance against Everton, with Alan Shearer even selecting him for his Premier League Team of the Week.\n\nThe midfielder completed 90% of his passes in Arsenal’s 1-0 win, creating two chances including one big chance and making 10 defensive contributions. The midfielder also won seven of his nine individual duels.\n\nAs frustrating as it must have been to come up against his old player on Saturday, Moyes must privately feel proud of his part in Rice’s rise.",

Through an official statement, the blue institution confirmed the departure of two players who were part of the team's recent successes: the Argentine forward Lucas Di Yorio and the central defender Ignacio Tapia.\n\nLucas Di Yorio ends his stint with the \"Romantic Traveler\" after concluding his loan from Athletico Paranaense. The forward, who arrived at the beginning of 2025, leaves with a record of 43 matches played and the 2025 Super Cup champion's medal in hand. Despite his consistency, the club decided not to extend the contract with the Brazilian.\n\nOn the other hand, Ignacio Tapia closes a much longer cycle. The defender finished his contract after four seasons with the institution (2022-2025). With 64 matches and one goal scored, Tapia bids farewell as part of the squads that won the 2024 Copa Chile and the recent Super Cup.\n\nThe club expressed their gratitude for the dedication and professionalism of both players during their stay at the Centro Deportivo Azul.

González showed plenty of flashes of talent early in the season, but his recent string of games — which has featured multiple double-doubles — has announced beyond a reasonable doubt that Hugo belongs on this stage.\n\nHugo’s play has garnered praise from teammates, fans, and analysts alike. Stan Van Gundy admitted early on in the NBA season that he was “falling in love” with González. Celtics center Neemias Queta recently praised the rookie.\n\nThe Ringer’s Bill Simmons has also been high on González, but Simmons’ recent Hugo post to X was especially notable, not to mention hilarious.\n\nSimmons posted a joke mock re-draft, in which he said he’d select González with the No. 1 overall pick, followed by Hugo again with the No. 6 pick.\n\n2025 Redraft\n\n1.

Although guys like Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel, and VJ Edgecombe are head-and-shoulders above Hugo in terms of the Rookie of the Year race, a lot of that comes down to minutes and usage.\n\nKnueppel has already become a first-option-type scorer for the Hornets, and he’s starting every game. Same goes for Flagg. While Hugo isn’t that type of scorer or player, his impact on winning is still immense. There’s a reason that González has the best total plus/minus number among NBA rookies right now, and it’s not just because the Celtics are a better club than the Hornets and Mavs of the world.\n\nBest Total Plus/Minus Among Rookies In The 2025-26 NBA Regular Season :\n\n1.

A big example of this came on Monday night when Hugo led a Boston bench mob comeback against the Indiana Pacers.

It is not FDA-approved. He began taking it in the hopes of accelerating his recovery after suffering a soccer injury.\n\nBut one constant in his health routine is much simpler: a daily smoothie.\n\nAs his first meal of the day, it packs in 50 grams of protein and 20 grams of fiber in 400 total calories.\n\nThe recipe includes fruit rich in antioxidants, plant-based compounds that research suggests help mitigate the cellular damage of aging. It also helps him get enough fiber, a crucial nutrient for gut health. Fiber helps nourish the microbiome in a way that may help prevent illnesses like heart disease and cancer as we age.\n\nCombined with protein (the primary building block for muscle), fiber helps improve fullness after eating and supports balanced blood sugar.\n\nMarchione's full \"smoothie stack,\" which he published on his website for other people to try, includes ingredients for gut health and energy, like:\n\nThis is a very high protein smoothie. The sweet spot for total daily protein intake to build muscle is about 0.7 grams per pound of body weight daily, studies suggest. For a 140-pound person, a single serving of Marchione's smoothie would be more than half the recommended amount in that range.\n\nIf he's loading up on extra protein in the smoothie, he adds digestive enzymes to make the protein easier to absorb.\n\n\"I find that if I don't do this, I have brain fog from too much protein at once,\" he wrote on his website.",

    "fullText": "Amazon has stopped more than 1,800 suspected North Korean agents from applying for jobs over the last 20 months, a top executive at the firm has said.\n\nIn a post on LinkedIn, Stephen Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, said North Korean nationals had in recent years been attempting to land remote tech roles with companies across the globe.\n\n\"Their objective is typically straightforward: get hired, get paid, and funnel wages back to fund the regime's weapons programs,\" Schmidt wrote.\n\nAmazon has used a combination of AI-powered screening and human verification to detect and block such applications, Schmidt continued.\n\nThe company's AI model searches for connections to around 200 \"high-risk institutions\" and analyzes \"anomalies across applications\" and \"geographic inconsistencies.\"\n\nHuman reviewers then conduct background checks, verify credentials, and carry out interviews, he added.\n\nSchmidt said fraudsters were becoming more \"calculated,\" with many targeting real software engineers in an effort to gain credibility.\n\nOthers attempt to take over dormant LinkedIn accounts or pay for access to existing profiles, he continued.\n\nAI and machine-learning roles have been increasingly targeted due to high demand, he added.\n\n\"Small details give them away,\" Schmidt went on. \"For example, these applicants often format U.S. phone numbers with \"+1\" rather than \"1.\" Alone, this means nothing. Combined with other indicators, it paints a picture.\"\n\nThe operatives often work with \"laptop farms,\" Schmidt said, which are US-based locations that maintain a domestic presence while workers operate remotely from abroad.\n\n\"This isn't Amazon-specific,\" Schmidt added. \"This is likely happening at scale across the industry.\"\n\nIn July, an Arizona woman was sentenced to 102 months in prison for her role in assisting North Korean IT workers in securing remote IT jobs at more than 300 US companies.\n\nThe Justice Department said the laptop farming scheme generated over $17 million in illicit revenue for the woman and Pyongyang.\n\nCrowdStrike's 2025 Threat Hunting Report found that the North Korean remote-worker scheme is a growing threat.\n\nAmazon had detected 27% more North Korea-linked applications quarter over quarter this year, Schmidt said.\n\nIn June, the DOJ said authorities had carried out searches of 29 known or suspected \"laptop farms\" across 16 US states. It said North Korean actors had managed to obtain employment with more than 100 US companies.\n\nThe DOJ did not name the companies but said they included Fortune 500 firms.\n\nThe FBI recommends that businesses scrutinize identity verification documents, verify prior employment and education, and require in-person meetings.",

    "description": "By America's 100th birthday, people traveled by steamboat and buggy, communicated via telegrams, and the Gilded Age was afoot.",
    "fullText": "The Second Industrial Revolution was ushering in new industries, innovations, and cultural shifts. It fueled the Gilded Age, and the fast accumulation of enormous wealth was reshaping American society.\n\nInterest in leisure and sports began to rise, a middle class emerged, and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 offered hope — albeit short-lived — to African American communities.\n\nEvery day life also looked different. People dressed in formal apparel as a norm, traveled by steamboat and buggy, and communicated via the then-emerging telegrams.\n\nTake a look back in history to see what life was like 150 years ago, from family life and fashion to transportation and food.\n\nAfter the Civil War, America entered its Second Industrial Revolution. During this time, cities became the place to find a job as factories popped up in urban areas. This sparked a great change in the family dynamic.\n\nBefore this time period, families mostly lived on farmland and made a living off their land. But from 1870 to 1920, millions of people moved to cities.\n\nPeople crammed into the streets of New York City 150 years ago, crowding the city. This marked the beginning of tenement housing, which packed entire families into one-room apartments. Most lived in squalor and in unsafe environments.\n\n\"It was all very dense, very crowded, and unregulated — conditions that fostered disease and inhumane living conditions,\" the New York Public Library reported.\n\nOnce the railroads were completed after the Civil War, many people moved out west to settle and farm the open land. While some think of these people as cowboys, the Library of Congress debunked that narrative: The people who moved out west experienced tough lifestyles, including \"long, hard hours of labor, poor living conditions, and economic hardship.\"\n\nTo combat poverty and hardships, many immigrated to the United States in hopes of a better life. From 1870 to 1900, 12 million people immigrated to the country, per the Library of Congress. At that time, the majority of immigrants were coming from Germany, Ireland, and England.\n\nMore than 70% of immigrants entered the US via New York City's Ellis Island.\n\nThroughout the 1870s and for decades to come, multiple practices were implemented to stop Black people from exercising their right to vote. In some ways, African Americans were free, but in many ways, they were disfranchised.\n\nIt would be nearly 100 years before many people of color could exercise their right to vote, with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Voting Rights Amendments in 1975.\n\nBefore 1870, public education was not a priority. But between 1870 and 1900, attendance at public schools doubled, as people saw the value of an educated society. In fact, the growing number of immigrant families in the US prompted the need for public schools as assimilation efforts demanded accessible education for children across the US.\n\nPublic schools were often one room and housed children of all ages. Students learned math, reading, writing, geography, and history.\n\nFor families who were extremely poor, children would sometimes forgo schooling and instead join the workforce to help the family's finances.\n\nMost parents 150 years ago would make toys out of items lying around the house. During this time, rag dolls were popular.\n\nIf you were wealthier, however, you would have access to handcrafted toys. Abroad, children played with dolls made of china, train sets, and soldiers. It was also common for children to play with toys that represented a story from the Bible.\n\nIn the 1870s, women's dresses tended to swoop towards the back and bunch around the buttocks, according to the Fashion Institute of Technology. It was also common that the dress fell flat against the abdomen. The princess waistline, which was achieved by wearing a tight corset, was also popular during this time period.\n\nSome men during this time period also used canes or walking sticks as fashion accessories.\n\nThe Spring Wagon is just one model that people used. It was a carriage that had two benches with one behind the other, per Britannica.\n\nIt wouldn't be until decades later, in 1908, that the Ford Model T popularized automobile transportation.\n\nThe first steamboat was launched in 1807, so by 1870, the industry had largely taken off.\n\n\"Steamboats dominated American river transportation,\" the National Museum of American History wrote.\n\nThe upstream and downstream systems allowed people to transport goods and people at a faster and cheaper rate.\n\nRight at the peak of the Gilded Age glamor, 1875 saw the launch of luxury train cars like the Pullman Palace Car Company, which produced high-end rail travel options for the wealthiest passengers.\n\nGrocery stores like Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company and the A&P opened in the mid-1800s, and they gained popularity by the 1870s.\n\nAround this time, women started buying mass-produced groceries instead of making their own, and \"five and dime\" stores also became popular around this time period for the same reason.\n\nAbout 150 years ago, Aaron Montgomery Ward started a mail-order business by publishing a catalog that featured appliances, furniture, and clothing. It quickly took off and became a popular means of retail for people in the 1870s.\n\nCycling got its start 150 years ago, but it became a national craze in 1890 when women began using bicycles as a tool to mobilize themselves freely, per the Smithsonian.\n\nPeople who belonged to the upper and middle classes loved to play tennis and golf.\n\nLawn tennis, which originated in England, spread in the US throughout the 1870s. The New Orleans Lawn Tennis Club — widely considered the first tennis club in the US — was founded in 1876.\n\nThroughout the US, baseball gained momentum during the 1870s after emerging a few decades earlier in 1846, when the first official baseball game was held in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1876, the National League was created by executive and later president of the Chicago White Stockings, William Hulbert.\n\nThe first intercollegiate football match took place in 1869 between Rutgers University and Princeton University, per NJ.com, but it wasn't until the mid-1870s that college football began gaining popularity across the country.\n\nThe first Harvard-Yale football match was held in 1875, and the rivalry between the elite schools brought attention to the game.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby got its start 150 years ago, in 1875. Today, the sporting event is still held in Louisville, Kentucky, and is considered an American tradition.\n\nConsidered \"America's oldest active gun club,\" per its website, the Massachusetts Rifle Association was founded in 1875.\n\nJust a few years earlier, in 1871, the National Rifle Association had been founded in New York.\n\nIn 1876, Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone, which allowed people to speak across long distances and revolutionized modern communications.\n\nFounded by the inventor, the Bell Telephone Company eventually became what today is AT&T, per the company's website.",

    "description": "\"Shark Tank\" and \"Marty Supreme\" star Kevin O'Leary explains his daily routine, which includes eating protein, biking, taking naps, and avoiding email.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Canadian businessman and entrepreneur Kevin O'Leary, 71, who gained popularity spending over nearly two decades as the blunt-talking investor on \"Shark Tank\" sarcastically nicknamed \"Mr. Wonderful.\" The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in Montreal and Ottawa and received my MBA in 1980. My second business, the software company SoftKey, became successful enough to acquire the educational software company The Learning Company in 1995. Four years later, I sold it to Mattel for $4.2 billion.\n\nI became a venture capitalist, mutual fund manager, and did some Canadian TV, starring on \"Dragon's Den,\" a reality series where entrepreneurs pitched ideas to a panel of investors. A few years later, Mark Burnett took me to lunch, as he wanted me to be one of the investors in a US version of \"Dragon's Den,\" called \"Shark Tank.\"\n\n\"I'm looking for a real asshole, and you're it,\" he told me. The rest is history.\n\nI'm also acting for the first time, playing a business tycoon named Milton Rockwell in the Timothée Chalamet movie \"Marty Supreme,\" which is in theaters on Christmas Day.\n\nHere's what a typical day in my life looks like.\n\nI don't need an alarm. Sometimes, when I have to be somewhere, I'll set it. But it's just a natural rhythm for me to get up at 5 a.m.\n\nGenerally, in business, there are five stories that start in Asia and then come sweeping across the globe. So I get up and watch the different feeds from Europe and Asia so I'm up to speed.\n\nAt about 6:45, when it gets light out, I get on my bike and ride for about 12 miles.\n\nI generally work out for about an hour and a half every day. It's for longevity and mental acuity; I have to do that, otherwise bad things happen.\n\nI don't eat breakfast. I fast for 16 hours and only have two meals a day. I'll have coffee in the mornings, but I don't buy it. That's stupid. Why would I pay five bucks when I can just make a coffee? I don't get it.\n\nI used to work for Steve Jobs. Before I sold The Learning Company to Mattel, we worked with Apple a lot to get the Mac into schools. He had this concept of signal and noise. He believed that you needed to do three things, and you had to get them done every day. You need a ratio of at least 70% signal, which are the three things, and the 30% can be noise, whatever is going to stop you from getting the three things done.\n\nIn entrepreneurship, and certainly in what I do today as an investor, there is no holiday, there's no workday — that doesn't exist. It's what you want to do with your time. So I pick three things I want to get done that day, and I don't let anything get in the way until those three things are done.\n\nI don't do emails anymore because I get anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 a day. I've tried every system to take the crap out, but over the years, my email address has gotten out there, and so it's just a constant stream of noise and garbage. As we speak, I see the emails just pouring in. I'm never going to get to them, so I don't try. So people who need to get a hold of me know that they are going to do that through messaging.\n\nLike my family. We have a family chat. That's very important messaging for me. It's perfect for when we are all in the same place. Through the day everyone is doing their own thing, but we figure out through the chat where we'll go out for dinner.\n\nI usually have fish and salad for lunch. Generally, I'm trying to eat 130 grams of protein a day. I do track my diet very closely, so I don't eat any shit food. There's no snacking or fast food. You can really change your productivity and how you feel with your energy by just eating a better diet and drinking less. I don't do drugs, I don't smoke, but I love wine. And I'm very careful when I drink that.\n\nA lot of my daily routine has been developed by working with successful people over the decades. I never gave a shit about sleep. I never slept at all. I could work off three hours of sleep, but then I met this CEO, and she said, \"You know something, why don't you try for 10 days getting seven hours and twenty minutes of sleep?\"\n\nI tried it for 10 days, and was she ever right. I felt so much better. My energy was up 30%, at least. And I felt like a million bucks in the morning. I felt really good.\n\nSo I got into the routine of finding seven hours and twenty minutes, and napping counts. So I nap in limos. I'm able to fall asleep as soon as we start driving. I tell the driver, \"Turn off the radio, I'm going to sleep,\" so 20 minutes to get there, I grab that 20 minutes of sleep.\n\nI like to eat around 7 p.m. or 7:30 p.m. A light Steely Dan vibe in the background is pretty good.\n\nI'll eat protein and have a glass of white wine, a Montrachet. I'll then move to red, a Burgundy or a Bordeaux. I'll keep it to two glasses, three max. I really try not to drink three hours before I go to bed. Because that screws up your sleep.\n\nMy wife and I generally watch a movie and then are in bed by 10 p.m. or 10:30 p.m.\n\nI've noticed something over the years in the people I invest in. The successful managers, entrepreneurs, founders, they all try something that they may not succeed in. So every time I get an opportunity that's completely outside my comfort zone, that I've never done before, that people tell me I'll probably fail in, I do it.\n\nI remember the conversation I had with my agent Jay Sures at UTA about doing \"Marty Supreme.\" He said, \"Listen Kevin, you're going to get offered this role but I want to warn you about something: You're not a scripted actor, you could shit the bed and destroy your brand that we're both making millions of dollars off of right now. You've got to think about this.\" And I said, \"Fuck that, I'm doing it.\"\n\nBut making the movie messed with my routine big time. Over an eight-month period, I worked on the film in New York and Tokyo. Some scenes I didn't shoot until 3:30 in the morning.\n\nAnd then there was the amount of takes the director Josh Safdie does. He wanted perfection — beyond perfection — so the takes would take hours. In the beginning, because I'm not used to working in a totalitarian environment, I finally said to Josh, \"Listen, this is my 25th take, I nailed it six times.\" And he looked at me and said, \"You haven't nailed it until I've said you've nailed it, do it again!\"\n\nI'm used to telling people, \"We're done,\" so that was the first thing I learned. But then when I saw the movie, these guys really knew what they were doing; it's unbelievable.\n\nBut I did get my naps in! I have hair in the movie, so I had to be in the makeup chair for hours to put it on and take it off. So there were two to three hours of free sleep there.\n\n\"Marty Supreme\" is in theaters nationwide on Christmas Day.",

    "title": "Taiwan needs to flood the battlefield with cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons to counter China, former senior military officer says",
    "description": "In a war with China, Taiwan could have an asymmetric advantage with a high volume of cheap and survivable weapons, a retired admiral said.",
    "fullText": "To prepare for a possible all-out war with China, Taiwan should focus on fielding substantial numbers of cheap, mobile, and survivable weapons, a former top Taiwanese defense official said.\n\nTaiwan currently faces two types of conflict — what experts and officials have referred to as China's gray-zone activities that are just below the threshold of war and the potential for a full-scale Chinese invasion. Countering both requires an array of weaponry.\n\nAt a Hudson Institute think tank event earlier this month, retired admiral and former chief of the general staff for Taiwan's defense ministry Lee Hsi-Min said Taiwan needed to prioritize the existential threat of a Chinese invasion. Gray-zone actions, such as frequent aircraft incursions, strain resources and stress assets and troops. The other could be catastrophic, as war games have shown.\n\n\"We need a large number of the distributed, mobile, survivable, lethal\" weapons, Lee argued, and those systems need to be low-cost, high-volume, and highly survivable in a fight, he added.\n\nAsymmetric warfare is a strategy that uses large numbers of inexpensive, mobile, hard-to-target systems — like drones, missiles, and dispersed units — to blunt a larger military's advantages by denying it easy targets and inflicting outsized damage. Think drones blowing up tanks in Ukraine or sinking Russian warships.\n\nLee argues that Taiwan's survival in a war against China depends on exactly this kind of strategy.\n\nTaiwan has aggressively pursued a strategy focused on weapons that fit these bills, including various types of drones, sensors, jamming, and anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles. Broader elements of increased investments in asymmetric warfare plans include how the civilian population of Taiwan is trained for a potential Chinese invasion and how the Taiwanese military would use urban warfare to hold off Chinese forces.\n\nThis doesn't mean conventional platforms and high-end weapons aren't valuable, Lee said, especially for helping Taiwan deter the everyday activities the Chinese military engages in, such as aggressive actions in the air and sea and massive exercises regularly held nearby. However, \"we need scalable\" and \"smart enough\" weapons, he said.\n\n\"If we are conducting the protracted war, sometimes the quantity means quality,\" Lee said. \"If we only have a kind of a small number of the advanced, sophisticated platform, I think we will have a big problem if China decided to attack Taiwan.\"\n\nSimilar lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. Soldiers, veterans, and drone makers have all said that a limited arsenal of exquisite systems isn't the right fit for a long war. The need is large volumes of cheap weapons. In warfare, sustainability is key. Overengineering and overspending simply aren't sustainable in a high-end fight.\n\nLee previously argued for asymmetric warfare and more mobile, uncrewed weapons and systems rather than buying more conventional weaponry like fighter jets and tanks in his \"Overall Defense Concept.\"\n\nIn 2020, he wrote in an article for The Diplomat that the idea is based on the premise that China will continue to see claiming Taiwan as a national and existential priority and Beijing will keep pouring money and resources into its military, which is vastly out-scaling Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan's government budgets for defense have increased substantially in recent years, and it continues to buy missiles, air defense systems, and drones from the US and other allies and partners.\n\nBut given the significant disparity between China and Taiwan's militaries and capabilities, \"Taiwan must abandon notions of a traditional war of attrition with the PLA [People’s Liberation Army],\" Lee and co-author Eric Lee, then a researcher at the Project 2049 Institute, wrote.\n\nTaiwan faces a substantially stronger adversary, and thus \"embracing an effective asymmetric defense posture and incorporating tactical asymmetric capabilities could compensate for Taiwan's disadvantage on paper and prevent the PLA from getting boots on the ground,\" they argued.\n\nAt the moment, Taiwan is leaning on a mix of capabilities. This month, the US announced its largest-ever weapons sale to Taiwan, at $11 billion. It includes High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, Army Tactical Missile Systems, Javelin missiles, howitzers, and drones.\n\nTaiwan's defense ministry said the weapons help bolster its self-defense and deterrence capabilities. China's foreign ministry said the sale violated agreements between Beijing and Washington and risked military confrontation with Taiwan.\n\nAn important piece of Taiwan's asymmetric strategy is rapid investment in domestic drone production, informed by lessons from Ukraine and collaborations with US and European firms. Taipei aims to produce 200,000 drones annually by 2030 and is investing billions into other defense systems, including a new air-defense network known as T-Dome.",

    "description": "Real GDP rose at an annualized rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, beating the 3.3% forecast and driven by strong consumer spending.",
    "fullText": "The US economy defied expectations in the third quarter of a year marked by uncertainty.\n\nUS real gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, exceeding the 3.3% expected and more than the 3.8% growth in the second quarter.\n\n\"The increase in real GDP in the third quarter reflected increases in consumer spending, exports, and government spending that were partly offset by a decrease in investment,\" the Bureau of Economic Analysis said.\n\nHeather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote on X that \"AI investment wasn't a big factor\" in the third quarter and instead consumption is a \"key driver,\" particularly due to spending from wealthier Americans.\n\nReal personal consumer spending rose 3.5% in the third quarter, more than the 2.5% rise in the second quarter. Imports again fell, but not by as much as in the second quarter, declining 4.7% in the third quarter and falling 29.3% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, exports rose 8.8% in the third quarter, after a 1.8% drop in the previous one.\n\nThe report was a surprise on the upside because the economy in 2025 has faced some headwinds. The effects of tariff announcements were reflected in imports, particularly in the first quarter, when real GDP declined. The fourth-quarter estimates may also be affected by the recent record-long government shutdown. The Congressional Budget Office said in late October that the shutdown likely lowered real GDP while it was ongoing and that growth \"will be temporarily higher than it would have been otherwise\" as the economy rebounds post-shutdown.\n\nThe new Bureau of Economic Analysis report follows other recent data releases that show a mixed view of the US economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently published inflation and labor market reports that showed unemployment at its highest rate since September 2021 and inflation unexpectedly cooling.\n\nMark Hamrick, Bankrate's senior economic analyst, said in an email that Americans will have to wait until next year to get more clarity on the economy's performance. He added that there will also be some benefits for Americans from what President Donald Trump called his \"one big beautiful\" bill, including federal income tax refunds.\n\n\"The good news is that the outlook for growth is improving as we enter 2026, as noted also recently by the Federal Reserve,\" he said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a December press conference that the \"baseline would be solid growth next year\" due to factors like AI and consumer spending.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish an updated GDP estimate for the third quarter on January 22.\n\n\"A key question for consumers, who power the U.S. economy, is whether the job market stabilizes or even improves modestly in the months ahead,\" Hamrick said. \"If not, their resilience and the resilience of the economy will be put to the test.\"",

    "fullText": "The first Christmas I tried the Elf on the Shelf trend, my son was already 6. It was during the pandemic, and I thought it might cheer us both up. I had a friend who was doing it with her kids, and it seemed like a lot of fun.\n\nI didn't think it was necessary to buy the trademark Elf. I had a little gnome that we used as a Christmas decoration, and decided to use that as our Elf.\n\nFor the first prank, I wrapped my son's shoes in plastic wrap — or rather, the Elf did. When my son woke up the next morning, he was confused, to put it mildly.\n\nFor the first few Elf pranks, I tried to keep up the illusion that the Elf was the one responsible. But my son figured out pretty quickly that it was me, all along. I kept doing something different each night anyway, and my son just thought it was funny. It was exciting for him to wake up and see what I had done.\n\nI started sending pictures of the pranks to my friends when I thought they were especially funny, but I really loved sharing ideas with the friend who had introduced me to the Elf on the Shelf. It gave us something extra to bond over. The Elf extended beyond something I was just doing to make my son laugh, and helped me connect more with friends, too.\n\nI still love saving ideas on Pinterest and seeing what other parents are doing on social media during December. In this way, I feel that it helps me feel connected to others on a deeper level. I think the tradition has caught on not just because it makes our kids laugh, but it's a way for parents to be kids again themselves.\n\nI honestly couldn't believe how much I laughed setting up some of the Elf surprises. I felt a little embarrassed laughing that much all by myself after my son had fallen asleep. Adults are rarely allowed to just be silly, and sometimes I struggle to do things for fun.\n\nAfter that first year trying it out, my son and I each found the whole Elf on the Shelf thing to be hilarious. The following year, he asked me if I was going to trick him again with the Elf, and I was so happy he did because I loved planning out all of those Elf tricks. For the 24 days leading up to Christmas, I basically get to be a kid again and make my son smile in the process.\n\nI'm not a fan of any Elf tricks that cost a lot of money or take up too much time, but I am guilty of buying some supplies solely for certain tricks. Mostly, I try to use things I already have around the house. Now that I'm married, my husband just kind of shakes his head while I set up some Elf scene late at night and laugh way too much.\n\nThe Elf tradition is something I started during the last Christmas that it was just my son and me before I met my now-husband. Our tradition is a little different since he has always known I'm the Elf. It's more of an inside joke between the two of us at this point. We've continued the Elf tradition ever since that first try, but he's turning 12 this year.\n\nWhile he has always known that I'm the one playing the pranks, I still feel like this should be the last Christmas we do it. My son will be in middle school next year, and I think it might be a little uncomfortable for everyone if I continue trying to trick him with a Christmas toy. Last year, I was already getting a lot of eye rolls from him.\n\nI think my son understands it takes time for me to set up the Elf antics for 24 days and that I do it just to make him smile, if I'm successful. That's the part that makes me enjoy the tradition a little more than him. Not only do I get to make myself giggle, but I get to see that face he makes when he's trying not to smile but can't help himself. As a mom, that's my favorite.",

    "description": "At 70, a woman with serious health problems joined a gym after her daughter's warning and lost 70 pounds, reversed conditions, and rebuilt her strength.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Joan MacDonald, 79, a former driving examiner of Collingwood, Ontario. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nJanuary 2017 was a New Year I'll never forget. It was one of the few times that my daughter, Michelle MacDonald, lost her cool with me.\n\nShe'd moved to Mexico the previous month and was visiting. \"I won't get to see you as often as I like,\" she said. \"And, every time I leave, I won't know whether it will be the last time I see you.\"\n\nThen she made another blunt comment that changed my life. \"Mom, why don't you go to the gym?\" she said.\n\nI had high blood pressure, kidney problems, and was at least 70 pounds overweight. Approaching my 71st birthday that March, I felt scared and miserable.\n\nMy doctor had already warned me that, if I didn't make an effort to improve my health, I would end up on dialysis before very long. I was effectively dying.\n\nGrowing up in Canada, I'd been an active child. I played ball, skated in the winter, and went bowling. I enjoyed doing them because they were fun. But I was by no means an athlete.\n\nI got married a month before my 21st birthday and settled into married life while working as a driving examiner. I juggled work with motherhood, raising Michelle and her older and younger brothers.\n\nGoing to the gym really wasn't a thing back then. None of my married friends worked out, or even thought about doing so.\n\nI believe that your body changes every seven years or so. I went through variations in terms of shape and size, and enjoyed certain foods, then went off them.\n\nI didn't have regular meals, often eating just two meals a day at irregular times. In between, I'd snack.\n\nThroughout my 60s, I was in poor health. I'd get bronchitis in the fall and spring — I had weaker lungs after contracting rheumatic fever as a child — and the kidney issues began.\n\nThe weight had grown to 200 pounds, which was far too heavy for my height of 5 feet 3 inches. And my blood pressure was high; I was put on medication.\n\nI'm lucky because Michelle is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and sports nutrition coach. She saw how unhealthy I'd become and was worried, especially because she'd moved thousands of miles away and couldn't keep an eye on me.\n\nHer recommendation struck home. It was enough to jolt me into action. My doctor also encouraged me to lose weight and reduce my blood pressure.\n\nI'd half-heartedly attended the gym before, but not consistently. This time, I went five times a week.\n\nI sought advice from Michelle and studied YouTube videos to learn how to use the machines and do strength training with free weights. At first, I couldn't believe how hard it was to pick up 20 pounds.\n\nI began with small weights and increased them by increments. I've since done a deadlift of 170 pounds and a hip thrust of 230 pounds.\n\nIt was amazing to see my body slim down and fit into clothes, like jeans, that I hadn't worn in a very long time.\n\nI lost 45 pounds in six months and a further 25 pounds during the rest of my 70s. I've gone from a size XL to a medium. I was able to quit my medications.\n\nMy current regimen involves spending two hours at the gym, with around 15 minutes of cardio, followed by using weights. I often work out with Michelle, whom I joined in Mexico for around a year after my husband died.\n\nAs for my diet, I eat five small meals a day, including oatmeal with egg whites, protein powder, and 1% coconut milk for breakfast.\n\nThen I'll have yogurt, an egg white omelette with ground beef, chicken, turkey, and ham, a protein bar, and a final, plain meal without starches. If I start my day at 7 am, I'll stop eating by 7 pm.\n\nUnfortunately, I suffered a shoulder injury while biking outside on a rough surface and needed surgery three months ago. I've had to take things a bit easier as I recover. However, I feel 100% happier and healthier than I did before going to the gym.\n\nMichelle and I established \"Train With Joan\" to help inspire people to take up exercise, regardless of their age.\n\nIt may slow you down a bit, but I've seen many seniors, even older than me, accomplish great things. They have resolved to do it for themselves. Nobody else is living in your body but you.",

    "description": "The holidays can magnify grief. I learned that honoring loss and love together is the only way to truly heal.",
    "fullText": "As the first Christmas after my son William's death approached, I couldn't bear the thought of putting up a Christmas tree. I couldn't imagine displaying all the nutcrackers we had collected together. I couldn't walk into our usual family gathering pretending to be OK. I was petrified of being watched, being whispered about, and being pitied by the other guests. I knew their concern would come from a place of love, but I just didn't want anyone else to witness my holiday grief.\n\nWe booked flights to San Francisco, the city where William was born. We drove up the coast to a small house by the ocean. We didn't decorate. We didn't invite anyone over. We just gave ourselves permission to be sad.\n\nBack then, I wasn't a bereavement expert or a grief advocate. I was a mother with no guidebook, suddenly living inside a story I never wanted to read. So we followed our instincts and did what felt best for us, without worrying how those around us would feel. Truth be told, that first Christmas was awful. We could barely find a reason to smile, and we all cried at different points throughout the day, but at least it was on our terms.\n\nIf you know someone who is grieving profound loss, remember: their need to change things isn't a rejection of family or love. It's self-preservation. They may need to escape, be alone, or decline the usual celebrations. Don't take it personally. Offer them the space and grace to do what they need to survive.\n\nIn the years since that first holiday season after William's death, we've come back to a lot of our past traditions. Some years we visit family, some years we see friends, some years we even host. But it will always be different, and as time has progressed, I have learned to accept that.\n\nAnd yet, despite being different, William will always be a part of our holidays. I set a place for him at the Thanksgiving table. His stocking hangs on the mantle right next to his living brothers'. I light candles for him and speak his name out loud.\n\nIf you're attending a gathering where someone is grieving a loss, avoid avoiding the subject. Speak their name and bring them into the room. Silence is so much worse than almost anything you could say. Push past your own discomfort and make the griever feel at ease. Ask questions about their person, like \"What was their favorite holiday treat?\" or \"What did they love about this season?\"\n\nWe, the bereaved, ache to tell these stories. Our loved ones aren't secrets to be put away during the holidays. They are part of what makes these days so special.\n\nI've found that giving outside yourself can be a really helpful way to cope during the holiday season. Loss can make your world feel small and self-contained. Being of service expands it.\n\nWilliam's birthday is right before Christmas, so that first year we organized a toy drive for a local nonprofit. We asked his friends, who would have been giving him a birthday present, to donate gifts for children in need. Dropping off bags of toys for those kids filled my heart in a way nothing else did that season.\n\nYou too can fill a void if your holidays feel empty. Volunteer at a food pantry. Run a coat drive. Bake cookies for your neighbors. The simple act of showing up for others can profoundly heal your heart.\n\nOften, when we see people laugh after loss, we assume they're \"over it.\" But laughter doesn't mean you've moved on. It means you're human.\n\nYou can cry over the casserole that doesn't quite taste like mom used to make, and then laugh, remembering how she always spilled something on her new dress. You can miss the person who's gone and still share joy with those who remain.\n\nJoy and sorrow can coexist. For me, the holidays will always carry both the ache of missing William and the beauty of remembering him with my living children. So this season, if there's an empty chair at your table, let it hold meaning. Let it be a symbol of enduring love, of a connection that time can't erase. Light a cancel, say their name, share their story.",

    "fullText": "Mark Wahlberg eats a high-protein breakfast every morning that would likely get a big thumbs-up from longevity researchers.\n\nIn an Instagram post last week, the 54-year-old said he always starts the day with three hard-boiled eggs, scrambled eggs with turkey pieces, a side of salmon drizzled with lemon and what looks like olive oil, and a bowl of blueberries.\n\n\"Same old, same old, every day,\" the \"Ted\" star, who is known for his strict wellness routine and daily 4 a.m. workouts, said.\n\n\"I eat the same breakfast every day, but I feel better every day!!\" the caption reads.\n\nIn 2018, Wahlberg's daily routine included waking up at 2:30 a.m., two workouts, and cryotherapy.\n\nBut as he's gotten older, he's dialed it down a little (he now wakes up around 3:30 a.m.) as he focuses on healthy aging.\n\n\"Getting a little bit older, I'm always now thinking about longevity, mobility, flexibility, lung capacity. Rest is equally important,\" he told Business Insider in 2023.\n\nHis breakfast reflects his health goals.\n\nThe meal contains healthy fats and polyphenols — molecules that are believed to help reduce inflammation — from the olive oil, salmon, and blueberries. These foods are thought to be great for brain health and preventing cognitive decline.\n\nHis breakfast also chimes with the Mediterranean diet, which consists mainly of unprocessed whole foods like lean proteins, fresh produce, legumes, and whole grains, and is considered to be one of the healthiest ways to eat for a long life.\n\nAlthough, notably, Wahlberg's breakfast is missing complex carbs.\n\nThe dish is also high in protein, which is essential for building and maintaining muscle as well as supporting metabolic health.\n\nAs the \"The Family Plan 2\" star strength trains daily, extra protein is key. To build muscle, a person needs to eat around 0.75 grams of protein per pound of body weight, sports nutritionist Rob Hobson told Business Insider.\n\n\"If you are pushing weights and you're trying to get this hypertrophy, so the muscle is tearing, then you do need to support that with a bit more protein,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "After seven wonderful years in Budapest, I had to move back to the US in early 2025 because of visa issues.\n\nPacking up my life and saying goodbye to my community, network, and home was an emotional whirlwind — to say the least.\n\nLooking back, there are things I'm grateful I did, and others I would have done differently to make the transition easier. Here they are.\n\nWhen it came time to pack, I slowly deconstructed my apartment over the course of a month.\n\nI made endless trips to the thrift store, posted on Facebook Marketplace, and even hosted a move-out party where I made snacks for my friends while they raided my closet.\n\nAfter all that, I still found myself frantically sitting on my suitcase, trying to zip it right up until my ride to the airport arrived.\n\nHowever, I can't imagine how stressed I would have been if I had left packing to the last minute.\n\nFrom Hungarian tax forms to old leases, I'm glad I had the foresight to keep all my paperwork from my time abroad.\n\nSince much of my work was international, I didn't have as extensive a paper trail here in the States. I feel relieved that I have all my documents, so I don't appear to have been a \"ghost\" for all that time.\n\nPlus, keeping them helped me sort out my finances when I got home. I spent a lot of my early years in Budapest operating off of feelings instead of building financial literacy skills, and that didn't put me in the best spot.\n\nReflecting on old tax and income documents helped me come to terms with the rocky finances of my early 20s and motivated me to make a better game plan for my next phase of life.\n\nLosing the connections, friends, and home I'd built over seven years was shocking.\n\nAt first, I tried to stay positive by looking for silver linings, such as being home for family birthdays and surrounded by the gorgeous Pacific Northwest nature. However, I eventually had to slow down and let myself feel the heartbreak.\n\nI took a social media break from friends and events in Budapest, so I could be mentally present in my new situation.\n\nTalking about this transition on social media also helped me build a community with other former expats going through the same thing.\n\nUnfortunately, before returning, I underestimated the state of the US job market. Although I found a part-time job as a barista to supplement my freelance marketing gigs, I still haven't found longer-term work that's both a financial and vocational fit.\n\nI've come to realize that relationships are what make the world go round, both professionally and personally, and after seven years abroad, I had to rebuild my Stateside network nearly from scratch.\n\nI wish I'd started putting out feelers as soon as I'd known I was returning to the US, and I wish I had signed up for relevant conferences to jump-start that goal.\n\nI was so consumed with the tasks of cleaning out my flat, closing my accounts, and saying goodbye to friends that health was the last thing on my mind.\n\nHowever, I wish I'd capitalized on booking doctors' appointments when they were more affordable abroad, as it's taken a long time to get set up with healthcare now that I'm back in the US.\n\nMaybe in a perfect world, I would have returned to the US with a job lined up, an affordable one-bedroom apartment in the city, and a group of old friends with open schedules. But that wasn't the case for me.\n\nSeeing other expats' stories about returning home on social media made it look like these things fall into place quickly, and I struggled with feelings of shame and inadequacy for not achieving that right away.\n\nBut looking back over this year, I've made quiet, steady progress that has set me up for a stronger future.\n\nI've supported my physical and mental health through training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and I've built a travel writing portfolio by landing a press trip and writing other articles.\n\nStep by step, I'm reaching my goals, and I'm proud.",

It also transports the secretary of defense on international trips.\n\nMany of the E-4B's features are classified, but the US Air Force has shared some glimpses into its capabilities.

The plane can seat up to 112 people.\n\nThe E-4B isn't just a \"doomsday plane.\" The defense secretary occasionally uses it to travel overseas and hold press briefings.\n\nIn the event of a nuclear attack or other apocalyptic scenario, the president, secretary of defense, and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would use the plane as a secure command and control center similar to the Pentagon.\n\nThe secretary's private quarters are furnished with a bunk and a desk with chairs.\n\nAt least one E-4B has been on continuous alert since 1975, ready to deploy at a moment's notice.",

    "fullText": "\"A Christmas Story\" is one of the most beloved holiday films of all time, but it wasn't an immediate phenomenon upon its release in November 1983.\n\nIt made a modest $19 million at the box office, according to Box Office Mojo, and was out of theaters before December 25.\n\nHowever, in the years since, it has become a true holiday staple after years of repeat showings on cable. Famously, TNT and TBS air a 24-hour marathon of \"A Christmas Story\" on Christmas Day, an almost 30-year tradition that's back this year.\n\nHere are some things you might not know about this film, including who almost made the cast and some blink-and-you-miss-it cameos.\n\nShepherd was a well-known radio personality, comedian, writer, and storyteller by the time \"A Christmas Story\" was released. The film is based on a set of short stories that were first published in Playboy before he compiled them into the collection \"In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash\" in 1966, per CBS.\n\nOther elements of the film were taken from his 1971 collection \"Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters.\"\n\nBesides narrating the film, Shepherd also cowrote \"A Christmas Story\" with his wife, Leigh Brown, and the film's director, Bob Clark.\n\nShepherd and Brown appear in the scene where Ralphie and his brother Randy meet Santa at the department store Higbee's.\n\nClark plays one of Ralphie's neighbors who questions the \nOld Man about the famous Leg Lamp.\n\nThis wasn't the first holiday film Clark worked on — he directed the Christmas-themed slasher \"Black Christmas\" in 1974.\n\nVanity Fair reported in 2016 that there was friction between Clark and Shepherd. Shepherd, for his part, was protective of his characters, while Clark was concerned with finishing the project on time and under budget — so he barred Shepherd from the set.\n\n\"Shepherd was a perfectionist with his own material, but Bob Clark had a budget and a schedule that he had to meet, and he already figured out how this all should be done, and he couldn't have Shepherd constantly interrupting,\" Shepherd's biographer Eugene Bergman told the publication.\n\nThe first theatrical sequel, \"My Summer Story,\" was released in 1994, and was once again directed by Bob Clark. However, almost no one from the original cast reprised their roles.\n\nRalphie — originally portrayed by Peter Billingsley — was played by none other than Kieran Culkin, while his parents were played by Charles Grodin and Mary Steenburgen in roles that were originated by Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon.\n\nThe only returning actor was Tedde Moore as Ralphie's teacher.\n\nIn 2012, \"A Christmas Story 2\" was released. It ignored the events of \"My Summer Story\" and once again starred an entirely new cast.\n\nTen years later, most of the surviving cast reunited for \"A Christmas Story Christmas,\" which was a direct sequel to the original, and followed 42-year-old Ralphie as he headed home for Christmas after the death of his father.\n\nIt's easy to see the connections: \"A Christmas Story\" is told mainly from the point of view of 9-year-old Ralphie, who deals with an annoying brother, a somewhat strict mother, and a distant but loving father. It's also narrated by an older version of Ralphie.\n\nThat's basically the setup of \"The Wonder Years,\" down to the older version of the main character narrating. It premiered in 1988, five years after \"A Christmas Story\" was released.\n\nThe connection was so strong that Billingsley himself had a cameo in the final two episodes of the show as a friend of main character Kevin (Fred Savage).\n\nAstin and Wheaton were two of the biggest child stars of the '80s.\n\nBut in 1983, neither was that well-known. Wheaton's big break came in 1986's \"Stand By Me\" before he was cast in \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" in 1987.\n\nFor his part, Astin starred in the 1985 adventure classic \"The Goonies\" before appearing in films such as \"Toy Soldiers\" (also starring Wheaton!) and, most famously, \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nWheaton wrote about his experience seeing Astin and Billingsley at auditions on his blog in 2001.\n\n\"I sort of knew Peter [Billingsley] because we'd been on so many auditions together, but I was always a little star-struck when I saw him,\" he wrote.\n\nThroughout the film, all Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle.\n\nBut this gun never actually existed. The Red Ryder model didn't have the sundial (the \"thing that tells time\") or a compass that Ralphie's ideal gun had, but a different model manufactured by Daisy Outdoor Products did. So, the gun had to be constructed specifically for the film.\n\nIn 2020, Daisy finally released an official replica of the \"Christmas Story\" rifle, aptly titled the Christmas Dream.\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Ralphie has a dream sequence where he saves his family from a gang of outlaws, and you can clearly see he's got a hunk of what's supposed to be chewing tobacco in his bottom lip.\n\nYou might think that a kid wouldn't be given real dip, but you'd be wrong. Billingsley told Vanity Fair that a propman on the set gave him some chewing tobacco, and within a few minutes he was profusely sweating and the entire set had to be shut down.\n\n\"We shut down for an hour or so, when I just had to lie down on the couch. This was long before they knew what to do with kid actors,\" he said.\n\nFor the rest of the shoot, the kids were given ground-up raisins.\n\nShepherd's hometown was Hammond, the only city in Indiana to border Chicago. The film uses a real street in Hammond, Hohman Avenue, as the inspiration for its name.\n\nThe house, which is located in Cleveland, has been turned into a museum. It's been restored to look exactly like it did during the production of the movie and houses authentic props and costumes from the movie.\n\nSuper-fans are also able to spend a night in the Parkers' home.\n\nOf course, there's also an online gift shop if you want to purchase your own leg lamp.\n\n\"A Christmas Story\" was originally released on November 18, 1983, a full month before Christmas. It never topped the box office and was out of theaters by the middle of December, which meant people couldn't even see the movie during the peak of the holiday season.\n\nBut the legacy of \"A Christmas Story\" was just getting started. It became a true cable classic — so much so that TNT and TBS each play the film for 24 hours straight on Christmas Day, and at various other times during December, meaning that millions more people have seen it on TV than ever did at the cinema.\n\n\"A Christmas Story: The Musical\" had two limited runs on Broadway for the 2012 and 2013 holiday seasons.\n\nFunnily enough, strengthening the connection between \"A Christmas Story\" and \"The Wonder Years,\" Dan Lauria — best known as Kevin's father on \"The Wonder Years\" — originated the role of Jean Shepherd on Broadway.\n\nFavreau and Billingsley are frequent collaborators. Billingsley has been credited as a producer or executive producer on six movies that Favreau has directed or starred in: \"Made,\" \"Elf,\" \"Zathura,\" \"The Break-Up,\" \"Iron Man,\" and \"Four Christmases.\"\n\nBillingsley's 2009 directorial debut, \"Couples Retreat,\" was cowritten by Favreau, who also stars in the film.",

    "description": "Business Insider's Pranav Dixit takes Tech Memo through Meta's 'year of intensity' and what 2026 will bring for Mark Zuckerberg's company.",
    "fullText": "Business Insider's Pranav Dixit has been covering Meta for a year now. He recently reported on the company's \"year of intensity\" with colleague Jyoti Mann. I asked Pranav for his take on a turbulent 12 months.\n\nQ: You've been covering Meta for a year now. What has that been like?\n\n\"Intense\" is the only way to describe it — exactly what Mark Zuckerberg promised employees. I joined BI a day before Meta scrapped third-party fact-checking, and almost immediately the culture shifted: DEI rollbacks, an embrace of \"masculine\" energy, and moves that seemed more aligned with the Trump administration. Then came thousands of layoffs of people labeled low performers and a noticeable spike in performance pressure.\n\nThe second half of the year brought a very different pivot. Meta effectively admitted Llama hadn't lived up to the hype and reset around a new mission: building \"personal superintelligence.\" That meant hiring Alexandr Wang, reorganizing AI under Meta Superintelligence Labs, and aggressively poaching talent while high-profile figures — including Yann LeCun — departed. It felt like covering a company reinventing its business, values, and culture all at once.\n\nQ: What stood out most from your reporting with Jyoti Mann on this \"year of intensity\"?\n\nA pervasive survival mindset. Over and over, employees told us the goal wasn't to do great work — it was to avoid landing in the bottom performance tier. Some people left on principle, saying Meta no longer resembled the company they joined. Yet others insisted this is the best job in tech: great product challenges, unmatched scale, exceptional pay. Those two realities sit side by side — one group bracing for impact, another thriving.\n\nQ: Your reporting found managers sometimes hiring people just to fill low-performance slots. How does that work?\n\nMeta's forced ranking requires a set percentage of \"low performers.\" Some managers gamed the system. Some told us they avoided backfilling roles; others hired into fuzzy positions with near-impossible expectations so they didn't have to put existing trusted team members in the bottom bucket. (Meta didn't respond to specific questions on this.)\n\nQ: What will you be watching for in 2026?\n\nThe big question is whether Meta's massive AI spend becomes a durable business or an expensive experiment. Will Meta AI become a distinct, everyday product? Will the capex binge translate into real revenue and profit? And can the culture stabilize enough to keep the AI talent Meta is betting the company on? Meta can execute — history proves that — but \"intensity\" can't last forever. 2026 will show whether the trade-offs were worth it.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Sunny, casual Christmases in Australia didn't seem weird to me until I celebrated in the US with my American wife. Now, I won't go back to old ways.",
    "fullText": "Growing up in Australia, December 25 meant swimming in the backyard pool, playing cricket on the beach, and eating cold prawns for lunch.\n\nWhenever I watched American holiday movies, I felt like I was witnessing a completely different, surreal celebration unfold, complete with snow, fireplaces, and people bundled up in heavy coats.\n\nThose movies might as well have been depicting the holiday on another planet — I didn't even see snow in real life until I visited Europe as an adult.\n\nIt never occurred to me how strange my Christmas could seem to others until my American wife moved to Australia and we celebrated together for the first time in 2014.\n\nOn my wife and I's first Christmas together in Australia, the weather was pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWe spent a lot of time outside and ate fresh seafood, just as I always did. In Australia, we often queue at fish markets before dawn on Christmas to get the best prawns and oysters.\n\nThat evening, while walking along the beach, my wife said the day just didn't feel right.\n\nThe heat, people wearing shorts and T-shirts, waiting until 10 p.m. for it to get dark enough to see holiday lights — it was all so foreign to her.\n\nShe joked that Christmas here felt like the Fourth of July with jingle bells. I thought she was overreacting, as this was all I'd ever known.\n\nTwo years later, when we celebrated with her family in Texas, I finally understood what she meant. This time, I was the one experiencing culture shock.\n\nWe wore sweaters indoors, the lights came on at 4:30 p.m., and we ate turkey, stuffing, and other heavy comfort dishes in front of an open fire while drinking eggnog.\n\nMy father-in-law insisted we watch the Dallas Cowboys on TV, which struck me as strange when I was used to playing cricket.\n\nDespite never experiencing this before, the whole ordeal felt oddly familiar because I'd watched all those holiday movies.\n\nHowever, the hardest adjustment was being inside so much. Back home, we spend most of the day outdoors — in the backyard, at the beach, and playing games in the pool.\n\nBut I loved this American Christmas celebration, even though I did miss having a pool to jump in.\n\nOur family has spent nine of the past 10 Decembers in the US.\n\nThe one time in the past decade that we stayed in Australia for Christmas honestly felt strange, as I'd become so accustomed to the cold-weather version of the holidays.\n\nLast year, we even took my sons to Chicago, braving the 20-degree temperatures for our most festive holiday yet.\n\nWatching my family drink hot chocolate from giant mugs at Christkindlmarket while bundled up in gloves and scarves made the season even more special. Shops had gone all-out with decorations, and the early sunset meant the lights came on before 5 p.m.\n\nThe fact that the holiday classic \"Home Alone\" was filmed in the area only added to the sense that we'd stepped into the ultimate winter celebration.\n\nLooking back, I finally understand what my wife meant that first year. Christmas really does feel different when it's cold and dark, even if you spent your whole childhood thinking prawns by the pool was perfectly normal.\n\nIf there's one thing I do miss about celebrating back home, though, it's the sun, outdoors, and energy of summer. However, that's not enough to give up my new traditions — especially since my wife won't have it any other way.\n\nAs for which is better? I'll have to plead the Fifth.",

    "description": "About 1,000 defaulted student-loan borrowers will receive wage garnishment notices the week of January 7 with more to come as the year progresses.",
    "fullText": "Student-loan borrowers behind on payments could soon start seeing smaller paychecks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Department of Education confirmed to Business Insider on Tuesday that it will begin sending wage garnishment notices to defaulted student-loan borrowers in early January. The Washington Post was the first to report this update.\n\nThe department said that notices will go out to approximately 1,000 defaulted student-loan borrowers the week of January 7, and the notices \"will increase in scale on a month-to-month basis.\" The garnishment occurs only after borrowers have received notice and an opportunity to repay their loans, the department said.\n\nThis update follows the department's announcement in April that it would restart collections on defaulted student loans in May, after a five-year pause. Over 5 million student-loan borrowers are in default, according to department data, which typically occurs after a federal borrower has payments that are more than 270 days past due.\n\nMore could soon enter default status — TransUnion reported 5.8 million newly delinquent borrowers in April, or over 90 days past due, meaning that if those borrowers don't make payments, they could enter default and have their wages seized, in addition to withheld tax refunds and federal benefits like Social Security.\n\nBorrowers in default have options to return to good standing, but they can be time-consuming and complicated. One option is loan rehabilitation, which requires a borrower to contact their servicer and sign an agreement to make nine payments within 20 days of the due date over a period of 10 consecutive months. Wage garnishment would continue during rehabilitation, but upon completion, the default status would be removed from the borrower's credit report.\n\nAnother option is loan consolidation. During this process, a borrower can apply to consolidate their defaulted student loan into a federal direct loan, but the record of default would remain on the borrower's credit history.\n\nLinda McMahon, Trump's education secretary, said when the collection resumption was first announced that the goal of the policy isn't \"to be unkind to student borrowers.\"\n\n\"Borrowing money and failing to pay it back isn't a victimless offense,\" McMahon said. \"Debt doesn't go away; it gets transferred to others.\"",

    "description": "JPMorgan Chase claims lawyers for Charlie Javice invoiced pointless work and outrageous expenses.",
    "fullText": "$161 for a seafood tower? Seems fishy.\n\nThat's what JPMorgan Chase's lawyers told a Delaware judge on Friday in an effort to get out of paying the rest of Charlie Javice's legal bill.\n\nThe bank sued Javice in late 2022, claiming that she and her cofounder, Olivier Amar, had faked data to inflate the value of their startup, Frank, which JPMorgan Chase paid $175 million to acquire. But Javice won an order requiring the bank to advance her legal fees, which is common in merger agreements.\n\nThree years later, JPMorgan claims that Javice and her lawyers have milked that order far past the point of what's reasonable. The 15 pounds of receipts submitted for reimbursement include high-end hotels, first-class flights, $530 in gummy bears, \"copious amounts of alcohol,\" and \"a $581 dinner for two that included a $161 seafood tower.\"\n\nThe bank's lawyers said Javice's lawyers continued to expense personal items into 2025, \"including a pet hair roller, laptop privacy screens, stain remover, allergy and cold medication, nutritional supplements, tea strainer, face masks, a coffee maker, lamps, a kettle, Uber rides for ordinary daily commute to a timekeeper's home office, 'groceries for meal prep,' bottles of wine, batteries, room upgrade charges at $300 per night, and meals at New York's best restaurants.\"\n\nIt blasted law firm Quinn Emanuel for a $60 Uber Eats order that included \"four cookies and a cookie box.\"\n\nQuinn Emanuel, which is representing Javice in the Delaware court case, said in a statement to Business Insider that JPMorgan \"is trying to walk away from its contractual obligation to pay Ms. Javice's legal bills.\" The bank is \"highlighting a handful of attorney expenses (not incurred by Ms. Javice) over two years, the vast majority of which it already reviewed and paid or are not disputed,\" Quinn Emmanuel spokesman Eric Herman said.\n\nThe bank also challenged the fees that Javice's lawyers charged for their time, as high as $2,700 per hour, including billing for trial attendance on a Saturday and other \"non-trial days.\"\n\nJPMorgan's lawyers said there were a total of 147 people — like lawyers and paralegals — who billed time to her defense, with the total bills across her criminal and civil cases crossing the $78 million mark. The bank said it has paid $60 million so far and says it shouldn't have to pay any more.\n\nMost of Javice's bills, $47 million, have been rung up by Quinn Emanuel, whose team was led by celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro and partner Samuel Nitze, who co-chairs Quinn's crisis law and strategy group. Another $14 million was billed by attorney Jose Baez, a trial lawyer who defended Casey Anthony; $5 million by his frequent co-counsel, the Harvard law professor Ronald Sullivan; and $11 million by Mintz, another big law firm.\n\nNearly all of the bills, $73 million, were incurred in Charlie Javice's criminal case. Javice was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years behind bars. The rest was incurred in civil cases. JPMC said Amar, the co-founder of Frank, who was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison, charged tens of millions of additional fees for his defense.",

    "description": "A holiday layoff stunned me, but as my kids grow up, I'm using this moment to rethink my career, my purpose, and what comes next for me.",
    "fullText": "The night before the Thanksgiving holiday, I received a message that I was being let go from my job, leaving me reeling in shock and tears, as I faced a holiday season with five kids and no stable income.\n\nAs a freelancer, I'm somewhat used to instability in my work, but as my writing jobs have slowly vanished over the course of the past year, having my last contract gig taken away really stung.\n\nI will admit that I'm panicked and feeling all the emotions from embarrassment to fear to depression over being an almost 40-year-old woman with no real prospects or plans for the future, but I'm also trying to reframe being let go positively.\n\nMy husband and I have five children — three of whom are now teenagers — and while my family has always relied on my income to make ends meet, life feels more expensive than ever.\n\nOur oldest is going to college next fall, our second oldest is about to turn 16, and wants to drive. Several of our children are involved in travel sports, and between the groceries and home upkeep bills alone, it truly feels like one of the most financially intensive times in our lives.\n\nI also don't have the luxury of a wealthy spouse to pick up the pieces. My husband is a public school teacher in a very rural district, and we have even qualified for free lunches ourselves. Therefore, the most logical and practical thing for me to do would be to rush to find a stable, full-time job ASAP.\n\nBut I'm going to be honest with you: a tiny piece of me is shouting to take this time to explore what I actually want to do in this next stage of my life.\n\nSomewhat coincidentally, the change in my job status has also happened alongside a shift in my path as a mother. This fall, my youngest child started kindergarten. After 17 straight years, I was no longer needed in a full-time capacity at home like I was before. While my focus has always been on being available to my kids first and fitting in work in the margins of family life and naptime, that need has significantly lessened.\n\nThat's not to go without saying that I'm not needed — I've actually shared that in many ways, parenting older kids has felt more time and emotionally intensive for me, but I do feel a shift in how I view my identity and sense of self in passing the baby and toddler stage after spending so much time in it. Who am I when the kids are gone? How will I fill my days? Will I ever be able to retire and live comfortably if I've never worked a 'real' job?\n\nSuddenly, I'm facing the reality of what my life will look like as my kids start to leave the nest. As a freelancer, I've always cobbled together whatever writing jobs I could, so while I had steady work (up until now), I never had a true career path or felt \"settled\" in my role. Truthfully, I felt like I was just faking it until I got too old or someone realized I wasn't a good writer after all.\n\nNow, it seems like my time is up.\n\nI know I need to find real work, and I have put out feelers. I hold my nursing license, so I've already spoken with a recruiter at a local hospital and applied for some remote nursing positions.\n\nBut I'm also trying to do some things just for fun.\n\nFor instance, a few months ago, I trained to become a sub at our local library, and I signed up to be a recess monitor at my daughter's school (I thought it would be fun to see her at recess and get some fresh air, but I'll report back on that after I actually do it!).\n\nLast Saturday, I worked my first shift at the library, and I loved it. It doesn't pay very much, but I loved having a reason to get dressed and do my hair, the peace and quiet of a library on a winter afternoon, and the simple satisfaction of helping people find their next great read. I had an absolute blast, and my husband even remarked that I was 'jovial' when I got home.\n\nI'm also exploring some other business ideas that have been on the back burner, based on things I enjoy, such as self-publishing fiction books on Amazon, becoming certified as a personal trainer, or expanding the small farm my husband and I own.\n\nI know it's a time to explore what the next part of my life looks like. I'm feeling that sort of restlessness that only a mother in the throes of perimenopause who has dedicated nearly two decades of her life to others can feel.",

    "fullText": "TJ Maxx and Marshalls are two of the best-known discount department stores in the US, but they are not the same, as I discovered this holiday season.\n\nWhile the two stores are owned by the same parent company, The TJX Companies, each has a different mission. TJ Maxx calls itself \"a one-stop for quality, value, and the coveted brands you know and love,\" and focuses on higher-end brands, jewelry, and accessories, while Marshalls has an \"expanded men's department, as well as a larger shoe department where you'll find styles for women, men, and kids, too.\"\n\nDuring visits to the stores in New York City in December, I noticed the difference in quality between the two, but that wasn't the only contrast. The Marshalls I visited was more crowded, perhaps contributing to my feeling it was in disarray, while TJ Maxx was emptier, but also felt more organized.\n\nMarshalls and TJ Maxx stores vary between locations, so while my experience was consistent with my previous visits to the stores, it may not be true of all locations. The TJX Companies did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nI get easily overwhelmed by the options available at stores like these, so I greatly preferred TJ Maxx, even though some items were more expensive.\n\nHere's what it was like at both Marshalls and TJ Maxx during peak shopping season.",

    "title": "The career rise of billionaire Alex Karp, Palantir's brash CEO",
    "description": "Alex Karp, CEO of the controversial data mining company Palantir, is an eccentric executive, even by Silicon Valley standards.",
    "fullText": "\"My biggest fans started off as Palantir skeptics and Palantir haters,\" Karp said during The New York Times 2025 DealBook Summit. \"I believe that someday, almost everyone in this audience is going to agree with me. You may not like me now, but you're going to agree later.\"\n\nThe longtime iconoclastic CEO of data mining company Palantir is not above a victory lap.\n\n\"Please turn on the conventional television and see how unhappy those that didn't invest in us are,\" Karp said before signing off on the company's Q3 2025 earnings call. \"Enjoy, get some popcorn. They're crying. We are every day making this company better.\"\n\nHe has many reasons to celebrate, including the fact that Palantir, while still too small by revenue to qualify for the Fortune 500, is one of the world's most valuable companies. As of late December 2025, shares of Palantir are up over 140% year-to-date.\n\nKarp, who has been CEO since 2004, is known as an unusual leader, even by Silicon Valley standards. He pursued a Ph.D. in philosophy before joining the startup and sometimes works from a barn.\n\nHe and the company have courted controversy over the years, and he's known to be outspoken in defending the company's work with government agencies and the military. In 2024, Karp said he's proud \"the death and pain that is brought to our enemies is mostly, not exclusively, brought by Palantir.\"\n\n\"We're not a normal company. We are fighting for what we believe, and we're putting in a product to give the people that agree with us a superior position,\" he said during the Times event.\n\nHere's how the 57-year-old Karp got his start, took the helm of the secretive startup, and built it into a multi-billion-dollar company.\n\nAlex Karp grew up in Philadelphia. His parents, a pediatrician and an artist, whom Karp has described as hippies, often took him to labor rights demonstrations and anti-Reagan protests when he was young. Karp was a \"self-described socialist,\" according to a 2018 Wall Street Journal profile. Karp got his bachelor's degree at Haverford College in Pennsylvania before attending law school at Stanford University.\n\nAt Stanford, he was a classmate of PayPal cofounder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel. After law school, Karp began working on a Ph.D. in philosophy at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany, studying under famed philosopher Jürgen Habermas. Karp is fluent in German and also speaks French.\n\nAround the same time, an inheritance from his grandfather sparked an interest in investing. According to Forbes, Karp quickly became successful at it and created a London-based firm called Caedmon Group, named after his middle name, investing on behalf of high-net-worth clients. By 2003, Thiel, Karp's law school classmate, had already founded and sold PayPal to eBay for $1.5 billion.\n\nHe decided to launch Palantir, along with Stanford computer science graduates Joe Lonsdale and Stephen Cohen, plus Nathan Gettings, a PayPal engineer. By 2004, Karp joined as CEO.\n\nThe company is named after the mystical, all-powerful seeing stone in \"The Lord of the Rings.\" Karp often wears brightly colored athletic wear, keeps Tai Chi swords in his offices, and was known to practice martial arts on his Palantir cofounders in the office hallways.\n\nDespite an estimated net worth of around $15.3 billion, Karp doesn't appear to spend lavishly.\n\nKarp has been known to sometimes work out of a barn in New Hampshire. He has never been married and told Forbes that the idea of starting a family gives him \"hives.\"\n\nPalantir is also pretty secretive. Because of the company's contracts, many employees hold government security clearances and receive five-figure bonuses for choosing to live close to the office, according to the Journal. The company has been criticized for licensing its technology to law enforcement, which has used it for practices like predictive policing and tracking cars' routes using only their license plates.\n\nPalantir has also come under fire for its contracts with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The company provides software that helps the agency gather, store, and search through data on undocumented immigrants. After employees pressed Karp on ending the company's contracts with ICE, he denied that its technology was being used to separate migrant families.\n\nKarp has responded boastfully to criticism of the company's contracts with the military.\n\n\"We are on the side of working-class Americans,\" he said during the Times event. \"We support people who go to the military, we save their lives, we bring them home safer.\"\n\nAfter Karp struggled to sit still during the Times interview, Palantir launched a Neurodivergent Fellowship.\n\n\"The neurally divergent (like myself) will disproportionately shape America's future,\" Karp said in a statement posted on X by Palantir.\n\nIt went public via a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2020, at an estimated valuation of $20 billion.\n\nKarp has frequently bragged about the company's performance and defended himself from critics.\n\n\"This is a US-driven AI revolution that has taken full hold,\" he said in 2024. \"The world will be divided between AI haves and have-nots. At Palantir, we plan to power the winners.\"\n\nResponding to criticisms of his leadership, he said, \"Instead of going into every meeting saying, 'Oh, yes, Palantir is great, but their fearless leader is batshit crazy, and he might go off to his commune in New Hampshire,' whatever thing we're saying, it's now like, yes, the products are best, and we have great products.\"\n\nReleased in February 2025, his book \"The Technological Republic\" argues that Silicon Valley has become complacent and lost its ambition. He cowrote the book with Nicholas Zamiska, Palantir's head of corporate affairs and legal counsel to the office of the CEO.\n\nKarp is a frequent guest at high-profile events and conferences. He's attended the annual Allen & Co. Sun Valley conference, a gathering of top tech and media leaders, in many previous years.",

    "description": "Andrej Karpathy led AI at Tesla and cofounded OpenAI. He wrote that vibe coding has produced a new type of code that is \"free\" and \"discardable.\"",
    "fullText": "He coined \"vibe coding\" earlier this year. Now, he has something to say about it.\n\nAndrej Karpathy led AI at Tesla for five years, steering the company's Autopilot effort and briefly working on its humanoid robot Optimus. He sandwiched his Tesla job with two stints at OpenAI, making Karpathy a cofounder of the AI pioneer.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Karpathy published his year-in-review for large language models on X. He reflected on the famous term he originated in February, a term that has since shaken up the software engineering industry.\n\n\"With vibe coding, programming is not strictly reserved for highly trained professionals,\" Karpathy wrote. He called it an example of how \"regular people benefit a lot more from LLMs compared to professionals, corporations and governments.\"\n\nVibe coding has likely benefited businesses, too. Tech companies have equipped their engineers with tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex, aiming for productivity gains.\n\nKarpathy wrote that vibe coding \"empowers trained professionals to write a lot more (vibe coded) software that would otherwise never be written.\"\n\nIt may also change the makeup — or the use case — of the code itself. Karpathy threw out a slew of adjectives to describe this new body of code: It is \"free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable after single use.\"\n\n\"Vibe coding will terraform software and alter job descriptions,\" he wrote.\n\nHow does Karpathy feel about being the term's origin?\n\n\"Amusingly, I coined the term \"vibe coding\" in this shower of thoughts tweet totally oblivious to how far it would go,\" he wrote.\n\nThere's a new kind of coding I call \"vibe coding\", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper…\n\nIt's not yet clear how efficient vibe coding is making engineers. In a METR study published in July, AI coding assistants were found to decrease the productivity of participating experienced software developers by 19%. The developers in that study were also overconfident in the tools, its authors said, expecting a 20% productivity boost even after using them.\n\nWhat is clear, though, is that the practice is unlocking a whole new form of tech products. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey vibe-coded a new messaging app this year. Non-technical workers are easily building, shipping, and, in some cases, even selling apps they build in hours, if not minutes.\n\nKarpathy gave some other reflections. He praised Google Gemini's Nano Banana image model, and wrote that Claude Code was the \"first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like.\"\n\nOverall, Karpathy wrote that 2025 was an \"exciting and mildly surprising year of LLMs.\"",

    "description": "Every year, investors ask for the same thing for Christmas. Here's what market pros are saying about the odds of a Santa Claus rally heading into 2026.",
    "fullText": "Investors tend to ask for the same thing every year for Christmas: for Santa to bring them a rally.\n\nThe Santa Claus rally refers to the seasonal stock market uptrend that investors enjoy (or at least hope for) in the last five trading days of the year and the first two of the new year. This year's Santa trading window begins on December 24.\n\nIt has been a strong year for the market, with the rally since the April lows bringing the S&P 500 to a string of record highs. Even as volatility in December has been high, investing pros say they're hopeful for a holiday rally to see out the year and ring in 2026.\n\nLouis Navellier, the chairman and CIO of Navellier & Associates investment firm, thinks that market conditions have set the stage for a Santa Claus rally. He noted this week that AI trade concerns are easing, and many areas of the market appear strong.\n\nNavellier said that small-cap stocks have been displaying impressive momentum lately, with the Russell 2000 rising the most, suggesting that investors are more willing to take risks as they prepare for a new year.\n\n\"The trend is our friend, 2026 looks to have a strong start, and a potential Santa Claus rally is back on the table, \" Navellier on Monday.\n\nMark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, is also optimistic about a Santa Claus rally to end the year.\n\nWhile Hackett cautions investors to remember that market conditions can cool in early 2026 after the momentum dies down, he thinks that there is a lot to like in the current setup.\n\n\"The last two weeks of the year are the best on the calendar since 1950, as investors position for year end,\" he said. He added that the market has been positive 80% of the time by an average of 1.6% since 1928.\n\n\"When this pattern is heavily discussed, it can become a bit of a self-fulfilling prophesy,\" Hackett said.\n\nOther finance pros urge calm as the year winds down. Clark Bellin, president and CIO of investment advisory firm Bellwether Wealth, thinks that markets might still see some volatility, but a Santa Claus rally is coming.\n\n\"Even though the market may feel turbulent in recent weeks, stocks have largely stayed range-bound so far in December, and the year-end seasonal strength may just be the catalyst we need for the market to break out of its narrow trading range,\" he stated.\n\nBellin added that his firm expects to see more growth from the tech sector in 2026 and he isn't the only one. Paul Stanley, CIO of Granite Bay Wealth Management, thinks that the Santa Claus rally will play out in the waning days of 2025.\n\n\"The combination of low volume and an absence of bad news should keep the Santa Claus rally alive and well for the rest of 2025,\" he noted. \"Valuations in tech are high, but some Mag 7 names have actually underperformed the S&P 500 this year, which suggests that there is still more room to run and that not all tech stocks are trading at runaway or complacent valuations.\"",

Yet the real influence often sits with a different group entirely: the extended leadership team (ELT), the tier beneath the C-suite comprising business-unit presidents, regional CEOs, and functional heads. These leaders make choices every day about which customers to prioritize, which capabilities to build, where to allocate resources, and which longstanding activities and processes to evolve. Yet they’re frequently treated as recipients of strategy rather than its architects.

    "description": "Get ahead of unplanned obsolescence by preparing for the worst before it happens.",
    "fullText": "My Neato D5 Connected was once a willing workhorse, but, today, things aren't looking so good. I recently caught an email from the company alerting me that it shut down my vacuum's cloud servers. Now, my once capable Neato is just a LiDAR-equipped vacuum with a soul that's been deprecated. Without cloud servers, the \"smart\" is gone.\n\nThis could be the lobotomized future awaiting Roomba users. Earlier this month, the company behind the pioneering smart vacuum, iRobot, filed for bankruptcy. The remainder of the business will go to its primary manufacturing partner—the one it owes all that money to—Shenzhen Picea Robotics. It's a stark reminder that the longevity of a connected smart device depends entirely on the financial health of the company that made it.\n\nI'm not giving up, however. I'm now attempting to get the Neato D5 back into business. Whether you have a Neato, a Roomba, or another robot vacuum approaching the end of its connected, you can mirror my steps to keep your device cleaning.\n\nFollowing the above email, I tried earnestly to get the Neato back online and back into a routine. I ended up reviving my original account by some miracle, though I have absolutely no access to the vacuum via the app as it currently is.\n\nLuckily, there is already a community of folks working to restore the cloud service that once enabled Neato's robot vacuums to schedule themselves. Neato-connected lets you use Home Assistant to manage the brand's devices without the cloud. This is the best choice for experts if the goal is to revive the robot vacuum to its full capacities.\n\nNeato has already said that the robots will continue to work manually. The D5 has LiDAR, so it can still physically \"see\" its way around a floor plan. And although you can't schedule the device or remotely control it, you can still get up and push a button to start a cleaning session. If you want to be super extra, Switchbot makes an affordable button-pushing gadget you can install near the vacuum dock to trigger it from your phone, essentially \"hacking\" a remote start.\n\nThe other headache of trying to keep old hardware from going extinct is figuring out if its parts and mechanics still work. My Neato D5, for example, still hasn't successfully managed a manual cleaning session. After some troubleshooting, which involved several factory resets, disconnecting and reconnecting the battery, and cleaning debris from all the sensors, it turns out that one of the LiDAR turrets—the hat on top—needs a fix. The vacuum won't start until that's addressed, since it literally can't navigate without that system spinning at a precise speed.\n\nThe Neato D5 is going to require some surgery. I am either going to fix it by stabilizing a band, or buy a replacement part from eBay and have someone more tech-savvy help with the install. There's always the option to donate it to a better cause, too. Rather than hold on to an eight pound paperweight rotting away in the utility closet, it can get a second life with a local robotics group, since Neato vacuums have a reputation for being highly scrappable due to their laser sensors.\n\nEven cheaper robot vacuums, like an Ecovacs, can find a second life this way. While they aren't as easily \"hackable\" as Neato (or a Roomba), there are plenty of high school robotics teams that can disassemble the devices to retrieve motors and wheels.\n\nNever throw a robot vacuum into the trash. If the device is truly dead and unusable for parts, look into responsibly recycling the Lithium-ion battery as well as the plastic and metal shell with an e-waste recycler.\n\nIf you own a Roomba, you aren't offline yet. iRobot is currently undergoing a restructuring, and the company has stated that app functionality and firmware updates will continue as usual. But inevitable change is coming if Neato's trajectory is any indication. We don't know exactly how Roomba's business will go now that it has changed ownership. Existing Roombas rely on the cloud for much of their flagship functionality, like Smart Maps, which help with specific room targeting. Losing the ability would be a major blow to the hardware's legacy.\n\nYou should prepare for what's to come, even if it involves a little over-preparing. Stockpile replacement parts now, while they're still available. Although Roomba's manufacturer has taken over the business, older models will fall by the wayside as a new generation of robot vacuums is introduced. If you want to get a few more lives out of your Roomba, buy at least a two-year supply of authentic, first-party brushes, rollers, and HEPA filters. Skip the third-party stuff.\n\nYou'll also want to invest in Roomba's dual-mode virtual wall barriers. Buy them used on eBay. These will come in handy if Roomba's servers ever go offline, since they act as infrared lighthouses to help direct the Roomba's path. You'll be able to use these with Roomba's \"Clean\" button, its manual mode that doesn't require the internet to start. You'll also want to look into downloading your Smart Maps, in case you can integrate them later.\n\nIf that isn't enough for you, there is a vibrant community of tinkerers who have long been dedicated to liberating Roombas from the clutches of the cloud. Projects like rest980 and dorita980 let tech-savvy users host their own local control servers, though this often involves a third-party device such as a Home Assistant hub.\n\nHistory tends to repeat itself in the gadget world. You can at least future-proof your buying decision by recognizing that obsolescence is a possibility down the line. This applies to any connected gadget, from big-name brands to small ones.\n\nMatter, the smart home specification that's been quietly rolling out over the past few years, will be more helpful for aging smart gadgets like this, especially since its latest release. It now enables local smart-home control for robot vacuums, so you don't need a cloud service to connect. The vacuum talks directly to your phone or smart hub instead. There are also brands like Roborock that advertise that their robot vacuums have local-only modes. You can even install another community-managed project, Valetudo, on those brands and go completely corporate-free.\n\nOr, you could go offline. Most connected home gadgets have variants that use a physical remote control instead. Eufy still makes versions of its robot vacuums without wifi, with no cloud features to worry about going extinct.\n\nI'm waiting before I buy eBay parts for the Neato D5 Connected. I need to see if I can fix what's broken with some finagling. It's a bummer I didn't think of preparing for the end of the device's life earlier—like when Neato's parent company announced its eventual shutdown two years ago—to give it a second life and save it from abject hardware failure. If all else fails, I can find it a good home with a robotics team or educational program that can put its parts to good use. I will have considered that a well-lived life for a connected gadget.",

    "description": "\"Last in, first out\" is the most useful email strategy.",
    "fullText": "You know the scenario: You have a bunch of unread emails . The more that come in, the more anxious you get—and the more you procrastinate on sorting through them. How do you decide which ones to reply to and in what order?\n\nEven when the amount of unreads isn't overwhelming, your choice can determine how your workday will go. In general, you should choose a side between a last in, first out (LIFO) or first in, first out (FIFO) approach—and, in my opinion, the best choice is LIFO.\n\nLIFO and FIFO are terms that come from the financial world—respectively, they stand for “last in, first out” and “first in, first out.” They’re often used by accountants to describe inventory but can refer to anything where items are coming “in,” like, well, emails. In this context, it refers to the practice of responding to either your oldest or your newest unreads first, then working your way in the opposite direction from there.\n\nLIFO, or the practice of answering the most recent emails before older ones, is more common than FIFO for good reason: Your most recent emails are the ones most likely to be time-sensitive, relevant, or actively blocking someone else’s work as they go unanswered. Meanwhile, the older a message gets, the higher the odds are that the window for a perfect response has already closed. At that point, stressing over it doesn’t magically make you more punctual, it just slows you down. Focusing on what’s right in front of you helps you stay responsive and on top of your current workload, which is usually what your job (or life) actually rewards.\n\n\"But what if I left the older ones too long?\" you worry. Don't—if something from the past is truly urgent or important, you’ll get a follow-up and, even though that might be embarrassing for you, it’ll bump the older content at hand into LIFO territory anyway. LIFO essentially relies on the idea that the older problems will sort themselves out or be brought back to your attention if they have to be. It’s like giving yourself grace on what you missed and focusing instead on what you can take care of right now. It works best if you rely on it when you have to, but commit to dealing with incoming mail in a more timely way going forward. If you miss too many emails and have to get too many follow-ups, your reputation will take a hit. That's why LIFO works best in general: Once you create the habit of responding to the last-in, you'll eventually stop having first-in messages at all.\n\nOf course, there might be times when you don’t get a follow-up or really do miss something important from the past. One day a week or so, use the time that you’ve blocked out for your email management to work in FIFO mode, going through your emails reverse-chronologically to make sure you didn’t miss anything big. Using FIFO too consistently can have negative consequences, though. If you’re always working on tasks from the past, you risk missing newer, more urgent ones that need immediate attention. Save it for one day every once in a while and use your time to handle pressing matters on a day-to-day basis.\n\nAn important element of either strategy is timing. Make sure to block out time for email management every day, ideally using a scheduling tactic like timeboxing. Dedicating specific, uninterrupted time to your inbox management makes it more doable and ensures you’ll actually handle the emails in the first place, whereas answering them sporadically through the day opens you up to the possibility of being distracted or procrastinating more frequently.\n\nIf you're struggling to adopt a LIFO mindset, consider the \"one-touch\" method. With this more intense approach, you commit to opening every email as soon as you get it. It will force you to build a habit that results in you never letting any email get away from you. Open the email, respond to it, and either delete or archive it, depending on if you’ll need it later. If it requires no response, even better. Schedule any required tasks into your to-do list, then keep on moving. You're more likely to get the task done when you need to simply by virtue of being readily aware of it because you opened the message as soon as it came in.",

    "description": "Sorting chronologically is too basic—it's time to level up.",
    "fullText": "There are a lot of methods to try in the never-ending quest for a way to sort through and slim down our bulging inboxes. They're different enough that there's certainly one out there that matches or comes close to matching your exact needs, but they do all have one thing in common: They rely on the chronology of when each email came in. Let’s try turning that approach on its head, and instead, sort by sender to weed through the mess.\n\nWhen purging your messages, you probably have an organizational system you follow, like the 4Ds. You go through and decide what gets deleted, done, delegated, or deferred—but there’s not much pattern recognition if you’re just starting at the top and working your way down. Every day's demands or outreach might look different depending on what you have going on at that time.\n\nSorting your inbox by sender instead of most recent helps you see whose (or what) messages you receive most. If it’s a newsletter or mailing list, you can delete them all in one go, but if it’s a specific person at work, you might get a signal that they tend to need a response from you. From there, you can prioritize their emails, maybe adding them as a favorite contact or paying special attention for new correspondence from them, since you know their messages are more consequential than others. Even if you're using the one- or two-touch methods, which call on you to open every single email the moment you get it, this can be helpful because you'll feel a sense of urgency around specific senders once you identify the patterns.\n\nSo instead of deleting or delegating emails one by one, you can try nuking or dealing with entire batches from certain senders to make the sorting process faster.\n\nIn Gmail, if you’ve already found a message from the person or entity whose emails you want to bundle up, you can right-click it from your inbox and hit “find emails from.” This brings you to an inbox only of messages from that sender. You can also access this inbox by typing “from:[their email address]” in the search bar, or clicking the advanced search button and entering their name into the “from” field.\n\nUnfortunately, you can’t sort your entire Gmail inbox by sender, and instead can only make bundles sender by sender, but it still helps with batching them up.\n\nOutlook is better than Gmail for this method. In fact, it allows you to sort your entire inbox not only by sender, but by other recipients, size, and more.\n\nAt the top of the inbox, hit “Filter,” then “Sort by.” Depending on what version you’re running, you may have to go into the “View” tab and hit “From” in the Arrangement group.\n\nThe emails will line up in your inbox by sender, making them easy to bundle and delete.",

    "title": "I Never Leave Home in Winter Without These (Cheap) Heated Gadgets",
    "description": "I am not afraid of the cold. The cold should fear me!",
    "fullText": "It never fails to annoy me when I tell my friends here in New York City that I am cold and they reply, \"But you're from North Dakota! This is nothing compared to what you grew up with.\" I know. Why do you think I left the coldest state in the continental U.S. as soon as I turned 18? I hate the cold in North Dakota, but that doesn't mean I hate the cold in New York any less.\n\nIndeed, wherever I am in winter, I'm at war with the cold—midwestern cold, northeastern cold, it's all cold. This is why I've devised a number of plans to mitigate it, and the most useful of my anti-cold measures is the collection of heated accessories I cart around with me every day. These gadgets are inexpensive, effective, and small enough to stash in my bag once I'm back in the warm embrace of the indoors after a shivering commute.\n\nMy friends do have a point: Us North Dakotans have come up with all kinds of ways to stay warm. Buildings in more populated areas are connected by skyways or underground tunnels, for instance, and people spend a small fortune each winter heating their garages so no one ever has to step into the cold for a second, even to get into the car. Growing up somewhere the cold can literally kill you if you're not prepared means growing up in a culture built around hacks to keep you out of it.\n\nWhen I moved to New York, I found it less cold, but I also discovered I was not ready for the reality of being outside and walking around in the winter. So I called on the spirit of my resourceful ancestors, replicating their anti-freezing measures on a smaller, personalized, more urban scale.\n\nI learned a lot along the way. For example, those crushable hand and foot warmers are useless because they're ineffective and will ultimately disintegrate into a grainy mess in your pockets or boots. Wearing a bunch of layers doesn't work for me either, because I'm still vain enough that I want to look cute and stylish when I get wherever I'm going, and that's not happening with multiple thermal base layers puffing up my outfit.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I've come to rely on \"heat tech\" that meets the following criteria::\n\nIt's small (so I can store it away post-commute)\n\nIt's effective at keeping me warm (or at least making me less cold)\n\nAll of that preamble aside, here are three gadgets I consider an essential part of my winter warming kit.\n\nMy winter time bag always includes a wearable heating pad (about $20). They are advertised for treating menstrual cramps, but the moment I saw one in my \"suggested products\" on Amazon, I knew it would be just right for my cold commutes, and I wasn't wrong. I've tried a variety of them over the years, and they all function about the same—which isn't necessarily a good thing, as no matter the brand, they tend to be a bit flimsy, so you'll probably end up buying a new one next year. I'd previously tried a heated vest, which I did like, but it was bulky and hard to store when I got where I was going. Belt-shaped devices work similarly but are far less obtrusive. They radiate heat around your core, are easily hidden under your coat, and can be easily stashed in a pocket or bag. (Two words of warning: Never let it rest directly on your skin, as you can suffer a minor burn and make sure to charge it whenever it's not in use, as they tend to run down quickly and recharge slowly.)\n\nMy heated scarf is a new addition to my arsenal this year, but I already consider it indispensable—it heats my upper body, complementing the work of my heated belt nicely. It's also around $20. I opted for a smaller one to make it easier to stash in my bag, but there are bigger, more fashion-forward options at the same price point. (Not all of them come complete with the removable battery, so make sure to check the listing carefully before you buy.)\n\nFinally, there are my beloved heated gloves. I ordered them in a fit of rage a few weeks ago after a pre-dawn walk to teach my 6 a.m. spin class. My hands were so cold I had to order a hot Dunkin' instead of an iced one—disgusting!—and I ordered heated gloves the instant they thawed. You have options here too: You can get the kind where the mitten top fronts fold back to leave your fingers exposed, as well as full-fingered gloves. Either way, I think you'll find them essential and easy to use, once you get used to having a battery pack hanging on the back of your hand (they don't have a removable battery, but can be recharged with a standard USB-C cable).",

    "fullText": "In 2025, I tested a ton of exotic smart glasses, e-bikes, and other gear for Lifehacker, but the tech that upgraded and improved my day-to-day life the most is a more niche product. I'm a (very) amateur musician, and Yamaha's Seqtrak is my favorite thing this year. It's an \"ideastation,\" a music production studio small enough to slip into a backpack. Look at how tiny this thing is:\n\nThere is so much music junk crammed in here, it's ridiculous: It's a full-on drum machine with eight drum tracks, step-sequencer, synthesizer with three separate tracks and hundreds of pre-set sounds, and a sampler—in other words, everything you need to create any kind of music from scratch, in seconds. It's even battery-powered with an onboard speaker, so it's fully portable.\n\nEven with all those functions, it's crazy easy to use for basic music-making, even if you literally have no musical knowledge. Here's what it takes to create a basic beat from nothing in about 90 seconds:\n\nThat’s just the surface. Everything can be customized completely. You can tweak any aspect of the presets and effects, add sequencer steps, mess with the arpeggiator, record or import your own samples, and warp sounds with countless synth parameters.\n\nIf you want to dig in further, there's a companion app for tablets, phones, and PCs that syncs with the Seqtrak and gives you access to all the on-board controls so you can change whatever. The app is a must for beginners: The Seqtrak has 32 input buttons, 17 dials, and three sliders, but it doesn't have a display screen, so being able to see what you're doing is a must until you're well-versed in the controls.\n\nThe screenshot below is only one of dozens of pages of elements you can mess around with to customize sounds and effects:\n\nIt can't do everything, but you can import your project from Seqtrak into another digital workstation for more advanced mastering or effects, and you can control the Seqtrak through an external MIDI device if you want more options than it offers from the box.\n\nYou could use this gear to build detailed beats and even full songs, bring it out to accompany yourself live (although, it's not the most rugged piece of equipment), or integrate it into your larger music set-up with MIDI, but I mostly just keep my Seqtrak next to my desk and play it with a MIDI keyboard—the seven little plastic keys aren't optimal—because it lowers the friction between having an idea and making it happen. It's way simpler and more immediate to fire up this groove box than start a new project in FL Studio or something. Plus, it's so tangible—physical dials and buttons are just better for creativity than sliders on a computer, even if they're controlling digital output.\n\nI don’t use my Seqtrak to finish albums or chase perfect mixes. I use it because it makes messing around with music easy and fun again. It’s a gadget that gives you endless options, but also gets out of your way.",

    "description": "This is the year of 6-7, but it's also the year of the performative male, the Mason, and reheating your own nachos.",
    "fullText": "2025 is limping to a merciful end, so I'm taking a look back at the year in slang. Below are ten examples of youth patois, chosen for both their popularity and for what they reveal about generations A and Z. Like most slang, these words and phrases evolved over time, so while many didn't first appear in 2025, but this is the year they gained popularity. (If you want a more complete list of youth slang, check out my guide to Gen Z and Alpha slang.)\n\n6-7 took off when Philadelphia artist Skrilla released \"Doot Doot (6 7)\" in February.\n\nFrom there, it was repeated in schoolyards and TikTok posts for no reason except maybe that it's fun to say. In a month or two, 6-7 reached full slang saturation, and everyone learned what it means (or doesn't mean). Dictionary.com named 6-7 its word of the year. It spawned spin-off numbers like 41 and 93. Older people waited for it to end, but 6-7 didn't end. We're almost a year in, and kids are still saying it constantly. So it means something to them. But what? 6-7's lack of literal meaning highlights the difficulty of defining a generation that seems uninterested in (or unable to) define itself.\n\nBrainrot describes online content, usually videos and meme images, that are stupid and meaninglessness. They're generally loud and assaultive, too: Brainrot is not subtle. It also described the supposed effect that consuming this kind of material has on kids. One of the earliest and most well known pieces of brainrot is \"Skibiddi Toilet,\" a series of YouTube videos that has billions of views. The genre has evolved from there, and now often consists of reframing and remixing obscure memes to create content that is almost entirely absent of meaning, like this Italian brainrot. Younger kids particularly spend a ton of time watching brainrot content, so it is likely shaping the collective worldview of Generation Alpha, but it's hard to say what the result will be.\n\n\"Slop\" describes the hundreds of millions of cheesy-looking, unsettling, AI-generated images, videos, and songs that have hit the internet since artificial intelligence gained popularity over the last couple years. Ease of production means that slop is rapidly taking over human-produced content, and younger people will live in a slop-dominated future. As a generation, they may have more intellectual and artistic connection to machines than they will with other humans.\n\nA Mason (or Mason 67 Kid) is a white, suburban Gen Alpha boy who plays baseball, rocks a fluffy “ice cream” haircut, and says \"6-7\" a lot. His sunglasses are Pit Vipers. He wears Yeezy slides. His polyester-as-hell ice cream shorts can be purchased at Dick's Sporting Goods. There's no way to know whether the word \"Mason\" will resonate enough to be remembered later, but it is, as far as I know, the first popular slang term to describe a dominant subculture in Generation Alpha. If it sticks around, it could be the equivalent of describing Boomers as \"hippies\" or Gen X as \"slackers.\"\n\nThis slang phrase describes artists whose new works are seen as trying to recapture what was good about their previous artistic output. It's not a widely used phrase outside of online fandom communities, but I'm including it to represent the kind of hyper-specific slang that comes from the relative rarity of shared cultural experiences among young people. They're balkanized, and every fandom, hobby, and interest group has its own language that is often not understood outside of the specific group.\n\nAn adjective that describes a person who does bold and/or exciting things, \"sendy\" is often used in the phrase \"let’s get sendy,\" which means something like “let’s do something big/crazy.” It also often means \"Iet's get drunk.\" It's an example of a slang word coming from a niche community and spreading into the larger culture.\n\nIt started in rock-climbing communities in the '80s or '90s, where “ascend it\" was shortened to \"send it\" and used to encourage people to \"go for it. \"Send it\" was then adopted by skaters, snowboarders, and other action-sports fans, and eventually slid into the mainstream culture when it was used in this video from influencers The Nelk Boys. Being able to so often pinpoint the exact source of a slang word is another unique feature of Gens Z and A.\n\n80/20 can refer to various scientific and organization principles, but that's not how kids usually use it. An axiom popular in online incel spaces, the 80/20 rule is the idea that 80% of women only date the \"top\" 20% of men. The \"male loneliness epidemic\" and increased social isolation resulted in many younger men accepting controversial, unproven ideas like this as empirical truth, and they have spread from online communities of misfits to the general population of Generations A and Z.\n\nThis insult is aimed at young men whose tastes, hobbies, and lifestyle are seen as a performance aimed at obtaining societal approval, especially the approval of young women. Like the 80/20 rule, \"performative male\" came from online spaces dominated by incels, and has since spread to the larger culture and expanded in meaning to the point that even reading in public is seen as performative. The problem with \"performative male\" is that it only refers to one kind of performance. The opposite performance of masculinity—the \"Alpha male\" envisioned by Andrew Tate and various lesser Tate-lets—is thus seen as genuine. It's an illustration of younger people's growing toxic masculinity as well as the strict policing of self-expression that comes from every public moment ending in potentially viral online ridicule.\n\nThe flip side of the \"performative male,\" aura farming is intentionally cultivating and projecting a cool, charismatic, or impressive image and getting away with it. It's generally seen as a good thing: Someone who is succeeding at their public \"performance\" of the self and actually coming across as cool to others is aura farming. Although one of pitfalls of aura farming is trying too hard, an experience that isn't native to younger generations—in the past, you might have called it \"being a poser.\"\n\n\"Beez\" means something like \"I am always\" and \"trap\" comes from \"trap house,\" but has a more broader meaning like \"place of business.\" So \"beez in the trap\" means something like \"I am at the place of business, hustling,\" but I'm not including it here for the words, but for how they took off online in 2025 and what it says about young people.\n\nThe rest of the slang in this column paints a fairly bleak picture of youth, but we shouldn't forget the creativity, passion, and heart that also defines Generations Z and A. \"Beez in the trap\" is an example of how younger people are re-mixing and re-shaping the culture we've left them into something of their own that is often amazing.\n\nThe meme works like this: Two people stand back to back. Person one passionately lip-syncs the chorus of 4 Non Blonde's song, \"What's Going On.\" The camera rotates to person two, who chimes in with Nicki Minaj's less existentially angsty track. It's one of those things that just sparks joy in a way that defies explanation and is quintessentially \"young person in 2025.\" Enjoy:",

    "title": "10 of the Best iPhone Privacy Hacks Everyone Should Know",
    "description": "Stop as much tracking as you can.",
    "fullText": "When you're using devices that are always connected to the internet, it's difficult to completely protect your privacy. Luckily, there are plenty of great privacy hacks for your iPhone, which you can use to make it hard for trackers and spies to collect your data and snoop on your business. From built-in solutions, like adjusting app permissions, to purchasing privacy screen protectors, here are 10 hacks every iPhone user should consider to protect their privacy.\n\nNo software privacy hack can protect you from people looking over your shoulder to memorize your password, or from peeking to see what you're up to. What can protect you, however, is a privacy screen protector. I saw this first-hand: One of my friends recently tried to show me something on her iPhone, and I realized that I couldn't see anything at all until her phone was directly in front of me.\n\nThese screen protectors can make it easier to use your phone in public spaces without worrying about who's looking at its screen. That said, there are a few potential dealbreakers. These screen protectors are rather plasticky, and don't feel as nice or smooth as your iPhone's touchscreen. These products also lower your screen's brightness. I don't mind, but it can be a problem if you're trying to use your phone in bright lighting. If you can live with these cons though, this is a cheap privacy hack that's definitely worth considering.\n\nApple is known for its privacy policies, but in recent years, its resolve seems to be weakening a bit. The company is pushing ads into its apps and your notifications, and it's aggressively encouraging iPhone users to There's not much you can do to block promotional materials coming from the company directly, but it's still worth changing a few settings to limit Apple's own ads. This includes reducing Apple's data collection, too. Many of these options are available under Settings > Privacy & Security on your iPhone. On that page, you can navigate to these pages to disable quite a bit of tracking:\n\nLocation Services > System Services\n\nCarefully reviewing all options on these pages and disabling unnecessary features goes a long way in limiting Apple's data collection.\n\nI used to allow all permissions an app requested when I first opened it. Over time, I realized that this led to a lot of notification spam, unnecessary data collection, and significant battery drain if the app was tracking my location. That's why I developed a new strategy: deny all permissions unless an app absolutely needs it. In general, I almost always deny permission to send notifications, access to contacts, location, camera, microphone, and photos.\n\nNewer versions of iOS allow you to share just a few contacts or photos, and even restrict GPS access to an approximate location instead of a precise marker. All of these are available under Settings > Privacy & Security in case you missed them while setting up an app.\n\nWhile the App Tracking Transparency option on your iPhone does reduce data collection from many apps, it's far from foolproof. In general, apps have access to far more data than their web versions, so if you can, you should try switching from apps to mobile websites wherever possible. If you delete apps such as Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok, and switch to logging in via Safari, you'll give away much less data, and some of the data you would otherwise give to the web apps will be blocked or spiked by Safari's privacy features, further protecting your data. As an added bonus, since web apps are generally a worse experience than dedicated apps, you're also far less likely to fall into a doomscrolling trap. I've used this fairly effectively with social media apps, but you can't always delete apps, like WhatsApp.\n\nInstalling an adblocker and a DNS app can do wonders for your iPhone privacy. Adblockers such as uBlock Origin are pretty good at blocking invasive tracking on your iPhone, but their effect is limited to Safari. To enhance the privacy of your internet traffic, you should consider installing an encrypted DNS app such as NextDNS, AdGuard DNS, or ControlD. All of these will block ads or trackers in most apps on your iPhone and safeguard you from some types of online security threats as well.\n\nEveryone should be using Safety Check on iPhone. This feature immediately lets you identify who you're sharing what with, including passwords, fitness activity, your current location, calendars, notes, and other data. To check on it, head to Settings > Privacy & Security > Safety Check > Manage Sharing & Access. You can go through the prompts to review app permissions, and set up an emergency contact, which ensures that your data (and you) are safe. While you can manually access all these options in the Settings app, the Safety Check prompt lets you find all features without combing through multiple pages, which will save you a lot of time.\n\nA good password manager is also a must. Free password managers, such as the built-in Passwords app or BitWarden allow you to create unique, strong passwords for each website, which makes it far less likely to compromise your accounts. You can also use these apps to store your two-factor authentication codes to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.\n\nEven better, these apps can manage passkeys to help you log in to your online accounts. Passkeys eliminate the need to remember passwords, and are far more resistant to phishing attacks that could compromise your accounts. \n\nYou should strongly consider enabling encryption on your data backups. This includes your iCloud Backup, and backups of your messaging apps such as Telegram or WhatsApp. Encryption makes it far less likely for an unauthorized party to read what's on your iPhone, as the data is totally scrambled without the key—which, in this case, is either your password or PIN. However, this is also where the danger lies. If you forget your backup password, even you won't be able to access the backup to restore data if you need to. Again, use a password manager to store these passwords so you'll never really forget.\n\nThis isn't necessarily an iPhone privacy tip as much as it is a general privacy hack, but it's worth mentioning. These days, trackers and hackers effectively use social media posts, photos, and videos to profile you. While there are plenty of steps you can take to limit the data you share on social media, you might not know you can remove identifying data from photos you post online. \"Exif\" data includes a host of stats about the hardware that took the image, including your camera make and model, shutter speed, focal length, and, perhaps most importantly, location. You don't have to avoid sharing photos to protect this data, however: just remove the exif data before posting.\n\nMost people are never going to need to use Lockdown Mode, because it's designed to protect your data when it's under attack from government surveillance or from espionage. That said, it's still worth knowing about this tool in case you ever face a cyberattack or if you suspect that your iPhone has been infected with spyware. Lockdown Mode disables message attachments, links and link previews, most incoming FaceTime calls, many Apple services, certain web technologies and fonts in Safari, and many other features.\n\nI repeat that this level of extreme protection is unnecessary for most people, but if you do need it one day, you can go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Lockdown Mode to enable it.",

    "title": "Do This Quick (and Quiet) Circuit Workout When You Need a Break From Holiday Family Gatherings",
    "description": "The time may come when you need to tap into the power of passive-aggressive mountain climbers.",
    "fullText": "The holidays are for rest, relaxation, and eating your weight in cookies shaped like reindeer. Your fitness goals can absolutely wait until the new year. But if you find yourself trapped in a house where someone just said, \"well, actually\" for the third time in ten minutes, and you need to escape to your old bedroom before you say something you'll regret—here's a quick (and quiet) bodyweight circuit you can do surrounded by your high school participation trophies.\n\nThese are my favorite beginner-friendly exercises to efficiently blow off some steam. Hopefully you have some floor space next to your twin bed.\n\nThese are classic push-ups, but you're listening intently for footsteps. Is someone coming to ask why you fled the living room? This adds an element of anxious anticipation that really engages your core. Modify on your knees if needed.\n\nDo some deep squats while internally composing the perfect rebuttal you'll never actually say. Feel the burn in your quads and your self-restraint. Make sure you're pushing your hips back until your thighs are parallel with the floor, looking to keep your knees bent at 90 degrees and in line with your toes. Bonus points if you can do these silently enough that no one downstairs hears the floorboards creaking.\n\nLunge from your bed to your old dresser (the one still covered in stickers, right?). Consider each lunge as representing a point in the argument you're nobly choosing not to make. You're not avoiding conflict; you're being the bigger person. And getting stronger glutes!\n\nRemember, when you lunge, keep your front knee over your ankle, not your toes. Keep your torso upright and your core engaged.\n\nHold a plank while contemplating how you've become the most emotionally mature person in your family. This is harder than it sounds, both physically and existentially. If you need to drop to your knees after 20 seconds, that's fine—you're still doing better than the conversation downstairs. My top tip for keeping your body in a straight line is to engage your glutes more than you might think.\n\nQuick, quiet mountain climbers that let you burn off steam without making enough noise to alert anyone that you've rage-quit the family gathering. Imagine you're running away from the discussion, but in place, silently, on your childhood floor.\n\nLie on your back (hey, you're already thinking about taking a nap anyway), feet flat, and lift those hips. Each bridge is you rising above the drama. You're literally elevating yourself. Metaphorically and gluteally.\n\nFinish with bicycle crunches while pretending you're pedaling away from this entire situation. Alternate elbow to opposite knee and find your center.\n\nSit on the edge of your too-small bed, breathing deeply, feeling virtuously exercised and only slightly guilty for abandoning your family. Check your phone. Consider going back downstairs. Hear a raised voice mention \"fake news\" or \"snowflake\" or whatever the discourse is today. Do another round.",

    "fullText": "A look back at the biggest tech stories of the year, from the rise and fall of Musk’s Doge to lucrative investments into AI\n\nHello, and welcome to TechScape. I’m your host, Blake Montgomery, wishing you a happy and healthy end of the year. I myself have a cold.\n\nToday, we are looking back at the biggest stories in tech of 2025 – Elon Musk’s political rise, burst, and fall; artificial intelligence’s subsumption of the global economy, all other technology, and even the Earth’s topography; Australia’s remarkable social media ban; the tech industry’s new Trumpian politics; and, as a treat, a glimpse of the apocalypse offered by one of Silicon Valley’s savviest and strangest billionaires.\n\nAt the close of 2024, I wrote that Elon Musk’s support of Donald Trump had made him the world’s most powerful unelected man. In 2025, his reign turned out to be short-lived. He rose fast and haphazardly, like a whizzing firework, only to explode spectacularly in June when he claimed in a post on X that the president of the United States was named in the government’s files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEven in that short period of less than six months, Musk made a tremendous impact. He tore up wide swaths of the US government – tens of thousands of jobs, the security of extremely sensitive data, and entire agencies like USAID – that may never be stitched back together.\n\nAfter Doge imploded, Musk promised to turn back to his business empire, which saw great success and great failures alike in 2025. His rocket company SpaceX saw continued growth and is poised to conduct an initial public offering next year, perhaps as the most valuable private company in the world. Electric carmaker Tesla, by contrast, faced violent backlash and major competition from its Chinese counterparts, which produced cheaper and more advanced vehicles while Tesla’s innovation and inventory stagnated. These headwinds caused a global sales slump for Musk’s carmaker.\n\nLook back at our reporting on Doge, Tesla, SpaceX, Musk himself:\n\nThe “department of government efficiency”\n\nHow an obscure US government office has become a target of Elon Musk\n\nHow Elon Musk’s billionaire Doge lieutenant took over the US’s biggest MDMA company | Technology | The Guardian\n\nThe chaos Elon Musk and Doge are leaving behind in Washington\n\nTesla faces backlash over Musk’s politics\n\nEggings, swastikas and dog poop: Tesla bears brunt of people’s ire against Musk\n\n‘I’m selling the Nazi mobile’: Tesla owners offload cars after Musk’s fascist-style salutes\n\nLook ahead: SpaceX expands in preparation for 2026 IPO\n\nInside Elon Musk’s plan to rain SpaceX’s rocket debris over Hawaii’s pristine waters\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX ‘preparing for flotation that could value it at over $1tn’\n\nArtificial intelligence has gone from a niche within tech to the industry’s most prominent focus. The Magnificent Seven – Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla – are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into new software that they hope will do the bulk of humanity’s work before too long. The investment is driving the bulk of the growth of the US’s economy, giving rise to fears of a financial bubble and its popping. The US and China are locked in a cold war-esque race against each other, with startups in each country vying for cutting-edge breakthroughs, as governments around the world are forced to decide how they will regulate a new technological force.\n\nBefore AI can arrive at that future, though, it needs brains a la the Tin Man of The Wizard of Oz. Those brains come in the form of data centers. These massive buildings, which house the millions and millions of semiconductor chips booming AI development, have cropped up around the world, met with enthusiasm from leaders eager for tax revenue and deep concern from environmental advocates and, increasingly, local community members. The investment in and construction of data centers wrought huge change in the physical landscape of the Earth in 2025 as tens of billions of dollars chased any available land, electricity, water and semiconductor chips.\n\nMore from our reporting in the last year:\n\nThe AI boom is heralding a new gold rush in the American west\n\nRevealed: Big tech’s new datacentres will take water from the world’s driest areas\n\nWhat will your life look like in 2035?\n\n‘It’s going much too fast’: the inside story of the race to create the ultimate AI\n\nMulti-trillion-dollar valuations\n\nIs AI a bubble that’s about to pop? – podcast\n\nWhat is new in UK-US tech deal and what will it mean for the British economy?\n\nMeet the AI workers who tell their friends and family to stay away from AI\n\nElon Musk made a full-throated and whole-hearted embrace of Donald Trump in 2024 and 2025. He was not alone. Many of his fellows in Silicon Valley did the same, sitting beside the Trump family at the president’s inauguration after donating millions to his inaugural committee. The tech giants continued their embrace of Trump and his policies by scuttling their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, which they championed during Barack Obama’s presidency, and by cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Trump’s harsh immigration crackdown. What the industry gave, it reaped tenfold in deregulation, friends high up in Washington like JD Vance and David Sacks, and a Trump order for states not to regulate AI signed just weeks ago.\n\nMore from our reporting this year:\n\nDonations and Trump’s inauguration\n\nElon Musk appears to give fascist-style salute after Trump inauguration – video\n\nTrump inauguration: Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk seated in front of cabinet picks\n\n‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech right\n\nZuckerberg’s swerve: how diversity went from being a Meta priority to getting cancelled\n\nDocuments offer rare insight on ICE’s close relationship with Palantir\n\nICE is using smartwatches to track pregnant women, even during labor: ‘She was so afraid they would take her baby’\n\nThis year saw Australia take the extraordinary measure of banning children under 16 from social media.

The gratitude-outlook groups exhibited heightened well-being across several, though not all, of the outcome measures across the 3 studies, relative to the comparison groups.

    "description": "The Stream Animals Thriving After a Megafire: Oregon fish and amphibians are surprisingly resilient",
    "fullText": "With climate change bringing higher temperatures and irregular rainfall, wildfires have been ravaging the West Coast of the United States in recent years. A history of limiting natural fires has caused buildups of dry brush that ignite into particularly potent blazes—“megafires.” Human survival takes priority in wildfire responses, with impacts on wildlife, such as stream animals that may experience aftereffects of fire in scorched watersheds, taking a backseat.\n\nA new study by scientists in Corvallis, Oregon, found, surprisingly, that many fishes and amphibians fared remarkably well after megafires. “Our work looked at the three years following megafires in western Oregon and suggests that fishes are thriving and amphibians are persisting,” said Oregon State University postdoc and study co-author Allison Swartz in a statement.\n\nSwartz and collaborators from OSU, the National Council for Stream Improvement, Inc., the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency surveyed 30 watersheds on the western slope of the Cascades. These conifer ecosystems in the shadow of the mountains receive abundant rainfall, making them home to diverse assemblages of fishes, frogs, salamanders, and crayfish. The watersheds selected for the study encompassed a range of fire history, including the nearly half-million acres burned by megafires in 2020.\n\nThe team expected to find lower densities of aquatic animals in more severely burned stream systems, particularly where timber had been salvaged, which is known to alter the dynamics of streamside runoff.\n\nInstead, the results showed that total densities of vertebrates were higher in streams that drained the most scorched watersheds. There were some species-level reductions, such as lower frog densities in areas with lots of timber salvage.  But, overall, stream vertebrate populations had weathered the changes well.\n\n“Despite experiencing high-severity megafires, vertebrate assemblages and populations seem to be buffered from fire-induced changes if adequate physical habitat and food availability are maintained post-fire,” concluded Swartz.\n\nThe researchers point out that co-existing with new, climate change-induced fire regimes requires not only taking care of humans but also considering the effects on native fauna. In their study of Cascade streams, some of the extreme events that can follow high-intensity fires, such as landslides, had not occurred. But more research on how wildfires change watershed ecosystems is warranted.\n\nEnjoying  Nautilus? \n\nLead image: Nuria PhotoStock / Shutterstock",

Whatever remains starts to look inevitable.\n\nThat inevitability is what we read as “natural.”\n\nWhen you look at a shell or a river or a muscle, nothing feels arbitrary. Not because it’s simple, but because every part feels like it had to be that way. You might not know the reason, but you can sense that there is one.\n\nAnd then I realized that most software feels wrong for the opposite reason. Too much of it exists “just because.” Buttons are there because buttons go there. Layouts change because someone wanted them to. Form gets decided first, and meaning gets patched in afterward.\n\nBut in nature, form is never first. Form is evidence.\n\nOnce you see that, it’s hard to unsee it. The stuff that feels good–tools you trust, interfaces that don’t fight you–almost always share this quality. They feel constrained. Not limited, but shaped. Like they’re under pressure from reality rather than taste.\n\nIt also reframes how adaptation should work. Natural systems change all the time, but they don’t feel chaotic. They stay recognizable. They don’t surprise you without reason. The changes make sense because they’re proportional to the forces acting on them.\n\nThat’s the part that feels important.\n\nMaybe the goal isn’t to make things that look organic. Maybe it’s to make things where nothing is arbitrary. Where if something exists, it’s because it survived contact with real constraints: time, attention, cognition, context.\n\nNature doesn’t decorate. It filters.\n\nAnd what makes it through the filter ends up feeling quietly, unmistakably right.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot has faced challenge after challenge this season, from Liverpool's horrid run of nine defeats in 12 to Mohamed Salah's explosive interview at Leeds.\n\nHow Slot deals without Alexander Isak is the next big question.\n\nThe Swede has hardly had a flying start to life at Anfield since making the £125m move from Newcastle in the summer, but the movement and finish for his goal against Tottenham on Saturday showed exactly why Liverpool signed him.\n\n\"You need to be at the top of the game to impact a game. And it took months before we could bring him up. We always knew it would take him time. And that's why it's so unlucky that he's now injured,\" said Slot.\n\n\"We all saw he was getting closer and closer to the player that he was last season at Newcastle.\"\n\nSlot said it is a \"long injury\" and Isak would be out for \"a couple of months\" and that is probably the best case scenario for Liverpool. It will, in all likelihood, be March by the time Isak can play football again.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Liverpool will make a move for another attacker in January, with expensive solutions to short-term problems not part of the club model.\n\nHugo Ekitike is also thriving with eight league goals this season, with Slot saying the 23-year-old has \"already adapted to the Premier League.\"\n\nAsked about the possibility of recalling Harvey Elliott - who hasn't played since October - from Aston Villa, Slot said: \"Harvey is an Aston Villa player and he is supposed to be going there for a year. If the question is about him then the best thing to ask is at Villa, who are doing quite well by the way.\"\n\nIsak has only made 10 starts for Liverpool since signing but with him now out of contention and Salah away on duty at the African Cup of Nations, Slot may be forced into a tactical restructure to deal with the Swede's absence.",

That clause was necessary to keep him at Bournemouth when agreeing his new contract in July.\n\nThe price, though, will drop slightly in the summer window.\n\nThat situation could appeal to Chelsea, who already have several wide options, including Pedro Neto, Estevao Willian, Alejandro Garnacho and Jamie Gittens.\n\nThe Blues have previously found both release clauses and signing players in advance attractive, with Strasbourg's Dutch striker Emmanuel Emegha, 22, and Sporting's 18-year-old Portuguese winger Geovany Quenda joining next summer after finalising transfers.\n\nThey previously showed interest in Semenyo as a 19-year-old in January 2019, when he was on loan at Newport County from Bristol City.\n\nBournemouth accept they are vulnerable to losing their key player and willing to negotiate with any club prepared to allow him to stay with them until the end of the season.",

    "fullText": "A female serial killer has admitted in open court to killing four men by intentionally causing them to overdose on fentanyl, Us Weekly has learned.\n\nRebecca Auborn, 36, was indicted in October 2023 for the intentional and ultimately fatal overdoses of four men as well as the attempted overdose of a fifth man.\n\nInitially, Auborn was facing 28 total charges, including four counts each of murder, involuntary manslaughter, and trafficking in drugs, and five counts each of aggravated robbery, felonious assault, and corrupting another with drugs. She was also charged with prostitution offenses.\n\nHowever, prosecutors ended up offering Auborn a plea deal, agreeing to drop 23 of the criminal charges if she accepted. She pleaded guilty to four counts of murder and one count of felonious assault.\n\nAuborn, according to a statement from Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, first tried using fentanyl to cause a man's overdose death on December 13, 2022, but failed. Little more than a month later, on January 15, 2023, Auborn succeeded in killing 30-year-old Joseph Crumpler.\n\nThen, months later, on April 1, 2023, Robert Snoke, 54, fatally overdosed on fentanyl, and Auborn stole his car and credit cards. While 64-year-old Wayne Akin was declared dead on April 17, he died from a fentanyl overdose on April 13, 2023. On June 17, 2023, Guy Renda, Jr., 42, became Auborn's fourth and final victim.\n\nAuthorities allege Auborn stole $2,000 worth of tools from one of the victims.\n\nAuborn entered the guilty pleas on Friday, December 19, and will be sentenced on February 20, 2026, at 9:00 a.m.\n\nThe Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force, established under Yost’s Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Commission, first received information about a woman meeting up with men for sex throughout northeast Columbus, and then dosing them, all so she could walk off with their personal belongings.\n\nThe Central Ohio Human Trafficking Task Force’s investigation of Auborn included any reported overdoses that happened between December 2022 and August 2023 in the area around Interstate 71, State Route 161, Cleveland Avenue, and East 17th Avenue in north Columbus.\n\nSeveral Months Later, Ohio Husband Austen Medek Charged With Murder After Wife Michaela’s Death\n\nThe pleas, according to Yost, \"closes a tough case. An overwhelming amount of convincing evidence and an airtight investigation conducted by BCI and Columbus Police left no doubt that a conviction was forthcoming. When law enforcement works together, there’s hope for families to secure justice.”\n\nAuborn was ruled competent to stand trial back in February, after the court observed her demeanor during proceedings. A written evaluation also permitted the case to move forward.\n\nRelatives of Akin have spoken to NBC News and said it is unclear whether he was actually a customer of Auborn’s. Akin's daughter, Christyn Akin-Crockett, has been critical of local police, claiming an initial lack of interest in pursuing leads confirming the man's death was suspicious.\n\nAkin-Crockett told NBC News she heard from a tipster that a woman named “becka” had killed four people, including Akin, in April 2023. She said she tried providing that information to the Columbus Division of Police but was dismissed and told to patient for toxicology test results.",

    "fullText": "A straw poll taken at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest has singled out one member of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet as by far the least popular with Republicans.\n\nThe event, held in Phoenix over the weekend, was the first since the murder of the organization’s co-founder, the conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\n“We wanted to get a real read on where the base is at after Charlie’s assassination, and a few things really jump off the page,” Turning Point USA spokesperson Andrew Kolvet told Fox News Digital on Monday.\n\nThe results were bad news for Attorney General Pam Bondi, with only 32.9 percent of those polled at the event saying they “strongly agree” with her performance.\n\nTransport Secretary Sean Duffy had the lowest disapproval rating, just 0.5 percent.\n\nBondi was the only member of Trump’s Cabinet to have negative ratings in the double digits. A combined 29 percent said they either somewhat or strongly disapproved of her work.\n\nBondi, 60, has angered MAGA loyalists this year by constantly fumbling the release of the Epstein files.\n\nAfter drip-feeding some heavily redacted documents, with the latest batch arriving on Friday, a statement by 19 of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims called out Bondi and her department, stating, “We are told that there are hundreds and thousands of pages of documents still unreleased. These are clear-cut violations of an unambiguous law.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nThe poll asked their support base to rank their priorities, with winning next year’s midterms a clear winner at 63.9 percent.\n\n“Defunding woke universities” was only voted as an issue by 1.1 percent, while the base was least interested in ending the war in Ukraine, which came last.\n\n89.5 percent of voters also said they would support a moratorium on new immigration into the U.S.\n\nThe poll also saw the vice president blitz the choice of who Turning Point USA supporters would like to see succeed Trump in 2028.\n\n“JD Vance won the 2028 nomination straw poll by more than Donald Trump won the 2024 one we did two years ago,” Charlie Kirk Show producer Blake Neff wrote on X.\n\nVance, who has regularly attended Turning Point events and spoken about his faith, scored 84.2 percent of the vote. Rubio took just 4.8 percent while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis earned a measly 2.9 percent. Donald Trump Jr. scored even less, with just 1.8 percent of the vote.\n\n88.3 percent of poll respondents self-identified as Republicans and 94.7 percent identified as conservatives.\n\nKolvet said the Turning Point “movement” is “all-in” for Vance as the next Republican leader.\n\nDuring the event on Sunday, Vance was cautious to fully condemn the rise of racism and antisemitism in the Republican Party.\n\nThe VP said conservatives should welcome everyone as long as they “love America.” He also said he was against using “purity tests” to work out who might be excluded from the religious movement over their beliefs, after questions arose over divisive figures such as Nick Fuentes and Candace Owens.\n\n“I didn’t bring a list of conservatives to denounce or to de-platform,” Vance said during his closing speech on Sunday.\n\n“We don’t care if you’re white or Black, rich or poor, young or old, rural or urban, controversial or a little bit boring, or somewhere in between,” he said of Turning Point’s entry policy.\n\n“We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,” he said.\n\nVance was more vocal about the Trump administration’s policies to end diversity and inclusion, telling the audience, “In the United States of America, you don’t have to apologize for being white anymore.”",

The video also says \"J Epstein\" in the bottom corner.\n\nThe DOJ began releasing the Epstein Files last Friday, and this video looks like it's been added to the document dump.\n\nEpstein's death has been shrouded in conspiracy theories ... with lots of folks who just straight up don't believe he killed himself.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump unveiled a new class of so-called “battleships” on Monday, but his plans are already hitting rough waters on social media.\n\nIn remarks from his Mar-a-Lago estate, the president claimed that the two “Trump Class” military vessels would be the “fastest, the biggest and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.”\n\nTrump described himself as a “very aesthetic person” while noting that he, along with the U.S. Navy, would work on the design of the vessels. Trump said the administration aims to make up to 25 of the ships, thus adding to its goal of creating a “Golden Fleet.”\n\nPolitics: Nicki Minaj Uses The Exact Wrong Word Onstage With Erika Kirk\n\nRenderings of the “USS Defiant” showed a vessel firing what appeared to be a laser beam and launching missiles.

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — A former close aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that immediately following the October 2023 Hamas attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza, the Israeli leader instructed him to figure out how the premier could evade responsibility for the security breach.\n\nFormer Netanyahu spokesperson Eli Feldstein, who faces trial for allegedly leaking classified information to the press, made the explosive accusation during an extensive interview with Israel’s Kan news channel Monday night.\n\nCritics have repeatedly accused Netanyahu of refusing to accept blame for the deadliest attack in Israel’s history. But little is known about Netanyahu’s behavior in the days immediately following the attack, while the premier has consistently resisted an independent state inquiry.\n\nSpeaking to Kan, Feldstein said “the first task” he received from Netanyahu after Oct. 7, 2023, was to stifle calls for accountability.\n\n“He asked me, ‘What are they talking about in the news? Are they still talking about responsibility?’” Feldstein said. “He wanted me to think of something that could be said that would offset the media storm surrounding the question of whether the prime minister had taken responsibility or not.”\n\nHe added that Netanyahu looked “panicked” when he made the request. Feldstein said he was later told by people in Netanyahu's close circle to omit the word “responsibility” from all statements.\n\nOn Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 hostages back to Gaza. Israel then launched a devastating war in Gaza that has killed nearly 71,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children.\n\nNetanyahu’s office called the interview a “long series of mendacious and recycled allegations made by a man with clear personal interests who is trying to deflect responsibility from himself,” Hebrew media reported.\n\nFeldstein’s statements come after his indictment in a case where he is accused of leaking classified military information to a German tabloid to improve public perception of the prime minister following the killing of six hostages in Gaza in August of last year.\n\nFeldstein is also a suspect in the “Qatargate” scandal, one of two close aides to Netanyahu accused of accepting money from Qatar while also working for the prime minister.",

    "title": "‘This is shattering’: Europe reels from Trump’s new world order",
    "description": "Europe still wants and needs to work with Trump. But this year’s made it clear they’re increasingly on their own.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump’s first year back in office shattered any remaining illusions among European leaders that he can be managed or controlled.\n\nHis open hostility toward the European Union has strained a transatlantic alliance that’s endured since World War II and deepened rifts between Europe’s national leaders and within the bloc, imperiling its ability to respond to Trump’s threats and taunts with the kind of unity and strength he respects.\n\nThat’s left Ukraine’s fate hanging in the balance heading into 2026, not to mention unanswered existential questions about European security at a moment when many fear Russian President Vladimir Putin’s territorial aims extend further westward beyond Ukraine.\n\nBut in many ways, Europe has survived the roller coaster — for now.\n\n“The Europeans cannot afford to cut ties and to hand in the divorce papers because they are still too dependent, especially when it comes to security and an American military commitment to defending Europe,” said Jana Puglierin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nBut, she continued, the efforts by leaders to maintain solid ties with the U.S. based on short- term interests do not mean the past year hasn’t clarified that the long-term interests are, for the moment, no longer aligned.\n\n“We need to be pretty clear-eyed,” she said. “In the old days, there was a clear mainstream understanding of the old transatlantic relationship enshrined by the Western values and norms and principles, the rules based international order. And now I think we see a competing project emerging.”\n\nThe administration is clear-eyed, too, heading into the new year.\n\nIt sees a continent losing its values and identity, beholden to liberal ideals that are doing far more to imperil European security than any missive from the White House. The act of a friend, the White House argues — as it pushes Europe to spend more on its own defense, restrict immigration and end the war in Ukraine — is to set it straight.\n\n“President Trump has great relationships with many European leaders, but he never shies away from delivering hard truths,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said. \"The devastating impacts of unchecked migration, and those migrants’ inability to assimilate, are not just a concern for President Trump, but for Europeans themselves, who have increasingly noted immigration as one of their top concerns. These open border policies have led to widespread examples of violence, spikes in crime, and more, with detrimental impacts on the fiscal sustainability of social safety net programs.”\n\nAfter a blistering start to the year with Vice President JD Vance lecturing Europe over free speech in Munich and then tag-teaming Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Europeans have adjusted to Trump’s worldview — a shift, as Romania’s Nicușor Dan described it, from a “moral way of doing things to a very pragmatic and economical way of doing things” — and succeeded at bringing the White House back into the fold on several fronts.\n\nThe EU’s submission on trade, accepting a new tariff of 15 percent, limited the short-term economic damage. NATO appeased Trump with its pledge to boost defense spending by 5 percent over the next decade, cemented at its June summit — thanks largely to allowing existing, non-defense spending to count for 1.5 percent of that new total.\n\nInstead of abandoning Ukraine, Trump agreed in July to provide additional defense aid for its war with Russia as long as Europe pays for it. And Europeans have been able to withstand Trump’s August meeting with Putin in Alaska and the administration’s announcement of a 28-point peace plan crafted in secret with the Kremlin, which they have worked with the U.S. and Ukraine to revise.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO earlier this month, Trump blasted European leaders as “weak,” asserting that they “don’t know what to do” about immigration in particular. He questioned whether European leaders should continue to be allies, saying that “it depends” on their policies and that he wouldn’t hesitate to intervene in European elections to back far-right parties challenging the very coalitions and leaders he’s currently working with.\n\nThat coincided with the issuing of a new National Security Strategy that called for “cultivating resistance” to European centrism that’s committing “civilizational suicide” and expressed disdain for the European Union, which the administration labeled as “adverse” to U.S. economic interests.”\n\nConstanze Stelzenmüller, a senior fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, called the Europe sections of the new NSS a “game changer” for leaders across the Atlantic that has “permanently changed” long-term strategy with the U.S.\n\n“It shouldn't be underestimated how much of a shock it was for European leaders and publics to read the Europe chapter of the National Security Strategy and to see put in writing that this administration thinks of Europe, or European political centrists, as unreliable allies and is taking such an adversarial one against them,” she said. “For 2026, we need to buckle up and plan for the worst on all counts. We have obvious vulnerabilities, and those are going to be exploited.”\n\nTrump is also ending the year by reminding Europe of his brazen desire, outlined in his first term and again shortly before his second inauguration, to seize control of Greenland from Denmark, a reliable NATO ally whose per capita defense spending is among the highest of all member nations. On Saturday, he appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, a job that Landry said would focus on efforts to “make Greenland a part of the U.S.”\n\n“This is shattering for a lot of the countries who thought that there was nothing safer than their bilateral relationship with the United States,” Stelzenmüller said.\n\nWhile openly threatening Denmark, the administration has worked to drive a wedge into the European Union by suggesting that countries would get better trade deals by splitting from the 27-nation bloc and engaging with the White House bilaterally.\n\n“At the end of the year, the fundamental question facing the Europeans is whether they think tactical victories are enough to win the strategic war, which is to maintain the transatlantic alliance that’s stood for eight decades,” said Ivo Daalder, a U.S. ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who earlier this month declared the “Pax Americana” to be dead, seemed open to the possibility, saying last week that it’s become “quite obvious” that Trump “cannot relate” to the EU and that “at least there are individual member states, including Germany first and foremost, of course, with which such cooperation can continue.”\n\nMerz led a failed push in Brussels last week for the EU to repurpose $200 billion in seized Russian assets in a loan to Ukraine when Belgium, Italy and others balked. But he ultimately succeeded with a back-up plan of sorts, as the EU approved a $90 billion loan for Ukraine aimed at sustaining its military on the battlefield for two more years. Three Trump-aligned leaders in Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opted out of the loan but did not block its passage.\n\nWhile Trump quietly opposed the EU effort to shore up Ukraine’s war chest, Europeans have mostly supported his diplomatic efforts to end the war, pushing for stronger security guarantees to ensure Ukraine survives long-term. Finnish President Alexander Stubb appeared Sunday on Fox News to declare that Trump’s efforts have helped advance the talks “closer [to a peace deal] than at any time of this war,” a comment seemingly aimed at the proverbial audience of one and only loosely grounded in what most European leaders actually believe.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has accused The New York Times of being a national security threat in an unhinged Truth Social post.\n\n“The Failing New York Times, and their lies and purposeful misrepresentations, is a serious threat to the National Security of our Nation,” Trump wrote in a late-night social media meltdown.\n\n“Their Radical Left, Unhinged Behavior, writing FAKE Articles and Opinions in a never-ending way, must be dealt with and stopped. THEY ARE A TRUE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DJT.”\n\nIt is unclear what prompted Trump’s latest attack on the newspaper he has long derided as part of the “fake news” media.\n\nHowever, the president and the White House were triggered for days over a November report in the Times revealing that the 79-year-old president has drastically reduced his public appearances compared to his first term.\n\nTrump, who is on track to become the oldest sitting U.S. president to date, is also starting his days later on average and working shorter hours than he did during his first stint in the White House, the Times reported.\n\nLast week, the paper also published a detailed report examining Trump’s friendship with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, describing how the two “pursued women in a game of ego and dominance” in which “female bodies were currency.”\n\nIn one particularly damaging section, a mother who accompanied her 14-year-old daughter to a party at Mar-a-Lago with other young models claimed she was warned by Trump’s then-wife, Marla Maples: “Whatever you do, do not let her around any of these men, and especially my husband.” Maples denied making the remark to the Times.\n\nTrump also took aim at the Times during a Monday press conference, accusing the paper of insufficiently covering his plan to lower prescription drug prices.\n\nThe president ranted about the outlet while continuing to push a dubious claim that he had lowered the cost of prescription drugs by the mathematically impossible amount of up to “3,000 percent.”\n\n“A drug that sells for $10 in London is costing $130 in New York. We’re bringing it down to $20,” Trump said. “So we’re going down—you can do your own math, but it’s 2,000 percent, 3,000 percent. It’s pretty amazing. And, you know, the New York Times had a story about it, a small story, way in the back of the paper. It’s the single biggest thing to happen with respect to drugs probably in 50 years.\n\n“It’s the biggest thing ever to happen, and it’s barely covered in the New York Times because it’s a fake newspaper,” Trump added.\n\nThe Daily Beast has contacted The New York Times for comment.",

    "description": "Tuesday's flurry of delayed data releases could fill in gaps in Wall Street's picture of the economy.",
    "fullText": "US stocks tipped higher on Tuesday after fresh data showed surprisingly strong growth in the US economy over the summer, leading investors to trim bets on near-term interest-rate cuts.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) both rose around 0.4%, with the benchmark index vying for a fresh record close. The blue-chip benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained around 0.2%. The turn higher came after the major gauges on Monday notched their third win in a row.\n\nGold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam through Tuesday morning, adding to a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades. At the same time, copper (HG=F) crested a fresh record above $12,000 per ton.\n\nTuesday brought a last gasp of data ahead of the Christmas holiday. Wall Street got a first look at third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter. That was much higher than the 3.3% expected, a potential sign of continued economic resilience. The shutdown-delayed report also found that consumer spending remained strong over the summer.\n\nAfter the release, traders pared bets on a rate cut in January. Markets now price in over 85% odds of the Federal Reserve standing pat, up from 80% a day ago and 75% last week. That said, a plurality of wagers remain on two cuts by the end of next year.\n\nBut Tuesday morning's read on December consumer confidence from the Conference Board showed the measure declining for a fifth consecutive month, as consumers' poor economic vibes persist.\n\nWall Street stocks have rallied back in recent days, after last week's data — including a surprise drop in inflation and lukewarm look at labor market — left bets on 2026 interest-rate cuts mostly intact.\n\nOn the corporate front, Novo Nordisk's (NVO) US-listed stock jumped in premarket after the Danish drugmaker got official US approval to market its Wegovy weight-loss pill.\n\nLooking ahead, US stock markets will wrap up trading early on Wednesday and be closed all day Thursday for the Christmas holiday.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that he sees room to revise the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target and move to a range-based system instead.\n\nSpeaking on the \"All-In Podcast\" on Monday, Bessent said, “Once we are back to [2%] — which I think will be in sight — then we can have a discussion: Is it much smarter to have a range?”\n\nThe US inflation target, set in 2012 at 2%, constitutes one-half of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, driven by maintaining a long-term stable inflation mark.\n\n10-year Treasurys (^TNX) ticked up by roughly 0.2% through the first half of Tuesday, while the Intercontinental Exchange's US Dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) moved down by the same amount.\n\nBessent's comments come after a delayed release of the November Consumer Price Index showed that prices increased by 2.7% over the year prior, compared to consensus estimates of 3.1%. So-called core\" CPI — which strips out the more volatile food and energy categories — rose by 2.6% against economist estimates of 3%.\n\nShares in US mining companies with copper (HG=F) operations are rising after the metal crested $12,000 per ton for the first time ever on Tuesday morning, setting an all-time high as President Trump's tariff policies and a string of mine accidents have roiled supply chains.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia was taken nearly completely offline earlier in the year after a deadly mudslide that left several workers dead, traded up by 1.4% in the first minutes after the opening bell. Fellow mining giants BHP Group (BHP) and Teck Resources (TECK) gained 0.4% and 2.5%, respectively.\n\nShares in Southern Copper (SCCO), one of the US's major copper operators, moved in the opposite direction, falling by roughly 0.4%.\n\nThe year has been strong for metals across the board. Prices on copper itself are up more than 37% year to date, while hot-rolled coil steel (HRC=F) and aluminum (ALI=F) have climbed by 32% and 17%, respectively, according to data from Trading Economics.\n\nWhile geopolitics have played a role, Trump's tariff regime has also sent copper and other metals prices soaring, dragging mining stocks along with it.\n\nWhen Trump announced plans in July to impose tariffs on copper, traders rushed to move physical copper stores out of warehouses overseas and back into the US to avoid these duties, which sent prices soaring. When the administration clarified that these tariffs would not apply to raw copper ore, prices came back down.\n\nUnder current policy, semi-finished products and copper-intensive goods, such as wiring or tubes, are covered under an identical 50% tariff, although raw copper ores are excluded. Imports of both steel and aluminum are currently subject to a 50% tariff.\n\nUS consumers remained pessimistic about the current state of the economy at the start of December, according to data from the Conference Board.\n\nThe Conference Board's consumer confidence reading dropped 3.8 points to 89.1 in December from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9, marking the fifth month in a row that consumer confidence weakened.\n\nConsumers' views on current business conditions were negative for the first time since September 2024, the report said. Survey respondents cited ongoing concerns, such as inflation, tariffs, and politics, although other topics, including immigration, war, and personal finance, also became more salient.\n\nAt the same time, consumers' expectations for inflation 12 months from now retreated after increasing in November. Consumers also had the most positive view of where stock prices are headed a year from now since January.\n\nOverall, households reported feeling mildly negative about their family's current financial situation, but turned slightly more optimistic about future conditions. Many reported putting off big-ticket purchases, as Americans reported spending more on necessities and cheap thrills than on expensive discretionary items.\n\nCloud software maker ServiceNow (NOW) has reached an agreement to acquire the cybersecurity company Armis in a $7.75 billion deal, the company announced Tuesday morning.\n\nThe transaction, an all-cash deal that ServiceNow said it will finance with both cash on hand and debt, will be ServiceNow's largest acquisition to date, according to Bloomberg. Shares in ServiceNow fell by roughly 2.6% after the announcement.\n\nThe acquisition is intended to broaden ServiceNow's cybersecurity offerings in its cloud products, the company said in its press release. Armis' security offerings will allow enterprise customers in industries with \"cyber-physical\" assets, such as healthcare and manufacturing, to get a more real-time assessment of potential threats, ServiceNow said.\n\n\"In the agentic AI era, intelligent trust and governance that span any cloud, any asset, any AI system, and any device are non-negotiable if companies want to scale AI for the long-term,\" ServiceNow president, COO, and chief product officer Amit Zavery said.\n\n\"Together with Armis, we will deliver an industry-defining strategic cybersecurity shield for real-time, end-to-end proactive protection across all technology estates.\"\n\nUS stocks opened Tuesday's trading on unstable footing after GDP data showed stronger-than-expected growth in the US economy through the summer, leading investors to pull back from bets on near-term cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe blue chip-heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell by roughly 0.2% in the most volatile move of the morning, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) ticked up by less than 0.1% each following the third win in a row for US stocks to start the week.\n\nCopper (HG=F) set a fresh record on Tuesday morning, crossing $12,000 per ton for the first time, while gold (GC=F) and silver (SI=F) continued to pick up steam, adding onto a stunning rally that has the precious metals on pace for their best year in more than four decades.\n\nBefore the opening bell on Tuesday, investors got a reading on third quarter GDP, which showed the US economy grew at a 4.3% annualized rate in the quarter, above the expected 3.3% growth. Predictions of a rate cut at the January Federal Reserve meeting fell in the aftermath, with traders pricing in only a 13% chance.\n\nUS gross domestic product (GDP) unexpectedly accelerated in the third quarter, coming in at an annualized pace of 4.3%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Tuesday.\n\nEconomists had expected the initial reading of annualized growth to slow to a 3% pace from last quarter's 3.8% reading, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe reading showed resilience in consumer spending and exports, though investments decreased, the BEA said. Imports, which are subtracted from the calculation of GDP, also declined.\n\nEconomists have noted that the economy has looked increasingly K-shaped, with higher-income households propping up spending while lower-income households become more financially stressed.\n\nThe advance GDP reading was originally scheduled to be released on Oct. 30, with a second estimate scheduled for Nov. 26, but the data was delayed due to the government shutdown.\n\nTom Hale, the CEO of Oura, which makes the popular health tracking ring, doesn't think a new hardware device from OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) will make the Apple (AAPL) iPhone obsolete, he told Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. Hale said it would have a long way to go to drive mass appeal.\n\n\"We've all had [Amazon] Alexa devices in our lives, and they're fascinating, ... but it's also kind of latent in the sort of bandwidth for information,\" Hale said in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast. \"I'm fascinated by conversations that you have with OpenAI or any of the models like Gemini. ... At the same time, it's not the perfect user interface for every kind of computing activity you might consult.\"\n\nHale added that he doesn't think the iPhone will go away, just as the iPhone didn't fully replace laptops or desktops.\n\n\"It's just another form factor for computing,\" he said. \"I think that's where the device goes, and I think that we'll have a cloud of wearables that'll be tuned to whatever your use case is.\"\n\nThe US dollar is on track to hit its weakest annual performance since 2017, according to the Bloomberg Dollar Index.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) stock fell 3% before the bell on Tuesday, following a surge on Monday. The Starlink rival's stock closed 14% up on Monday. AST's gains follow President Trump's signing of an executive order last week to secure America's \"space superiority.\"\n\nCACI (CACI) stock edged higher on Tuesday, rising 1% during premarket trading, following the announcement on Monday that the US defense contractor will acquire space technology provider ​ARKA Group from funds managed by ‌Blackstone Tactical Opportunities for $2.6 billion.\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) stock rose 1% before the bell on Tuesday, following the cruise liner posting positive Q4 earnings results on Friday, beating Wall Street expectations and resuming dividend payments.\n\nMilitary shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) saw its stock rise 4% during premarket trading on Tuesday and closed 5% up in the prior day's trading after the US Navy announced it had selected Huntington to design and build a new class of warship.\n\n“We look forward to supporting the Navy on this critical program,” said Chris Kastner, HII president and CEO.\n\nPresident Trump also said on Monday that he had approved a plan for the US Navy to construct new \"Trump-class\" warships to serve as flagships for the nation's naval fleet.\n\nRivals to Huntington saw their stock close higher yesterday, such as General Dynamics (GD), which saw its shares rise almost 2% on Monday, and Australian company Austal (ASB.AX), which has a major presence in the US, saw its shares close 6% higher on Tuesday.\n\nShares of Novo Nordisk jumped before the bell on Tuesday after the FDA approved its weight-loss pill on Monday.\n\nThe green light for oral Wegovy gives the Danish drugmaker a boost as looks to claw back ground lost to US rival Eli Lilly (LLY). Novo has seen a rocky 2025 of sliding shares, profit warnings, and slowing sales of its injectable Wegovy amid intensifying competition, including from compounded versions.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A protest erupted in India’s capital Tuesday in response to the death of a Hindu man who was lynched and burned by an angry mob in neighboring Bangladesh, a new sign of strain in relations between the neighboring countries.\n\nThe protest in New Delhi, mainly led by Hindu nationalist organization Vishva Hindu Parishad, highlights the fragility in the relationship between India and Bangladesh, which often is held up as a rare example of stability in South Asia.\n\nBangladeshi student leader Sharif Osman Hadi died in a hospital in Singapore on Thursday after being shot on Dec. 12 in Dhaka. Police in Bangladesh said they identified suspects and the shooter likely had fled to India.\n\nHadi’s death triggered widespread violence in Dhaka. The offices of two national daily newspapers were torched and Indian diplomatic missions were targeted. A Hindu man also was burned alive, which sparked the protest Tuesday in India.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators gathered Tuesday near the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, shouting slogans and accusing Bangladeshi groups of wrongly targeting minorities. They carried placards and banners with slogans including “India will not tolerate torture of Hindus in Bangladesh” and “Our silence should not be mistaken as weakness, we are lions.”\n\nAuthorities erected barricades and imposed tight security around the diplomatic enclave that included police and armored vehicles. Security personnel used batons to hold back some protesters who broke through barricades in an apparent attempt to enter the embassy.\n\nOne of the Indian protestors, Rajkumar Jindal, threatened “dire consequences” if authorities in Bangladesh failed to stop violence against Hindus.\n\n“People who are committing atrocities should stop doing that. We are here to awaken the people who are asleep,” Jindal said.\n\nHadi took part in a 2024 political uprising that ended the 15-year rule of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has been in exile since fleeing Bangladesh on Aug. 5, 2024. He was a fierce critic of India and Hasina and planned to run as an independent candidate in a major constituency in Dhaka in the next national elections in February.\n\nHadi's death sparked a new diplomatic squabble with India and prompted New Delhi this week to summon Bangladesh’s envoy.\n\nBangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also summoned Pranay Verma, the Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, to apprise him of the security situation at Bangladesh missions in New Delhi and state capitals Kolkata and Agartala, a leading Bengali-language newspaper reported Tuesday.\n\nTensions between India and Bangladesh increased again with the death on Thursday of Dipu Chandra Das, a 25-year-old Hindu man who was lynched and burned publicly following allegations of blasphemy in Mymensingh district’s Bhaluka subdistrict.\n\nDas's killing contributed to a pattern of fear among the Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of Hasina.\n\nReligious minority groups including Hindus and Christians have accused Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus of failing to protect the safety of Hindus and others. The Yunus administration has rejected the allegations.\n\nTuesday's protest could complicate cooperation on trade, border management and regional connectivity at a time when the region is already grappling with economic uncertainty and political polarization, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an international affairs expert at New Delhi’s Jindal School of International Affairs.\n\n“Opposing India and alleging Indian conspiracies of interference in Bangladesh are being done in order to harden a blatantly Islamist and non-inclusive path for the country,” Chaulia said.\n\nThe rupture is a setback to India’s broader regional strategy, while for Bangladesh the loss of India’s development assistance and markets could further dampen the country's slowing economy and push it further into dependence on China, Chaulia said.\n\nBangladesh and India have enjoyed a warm relationship since 2009 when Hasina came to power and until her ouster. Hasina was considered a friend by India and both countries thrived on bilateral cooperation. But Hasina’s opponents accused her administration of being subservient to India, a major trade and investment partner.",

    "fullText": "When Tony Dokoupil takes over as the \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Jan. 5, he won't be behind a snazzy anchor desk. Instead, he'll spend his first two weeks traveling the U.S. to \"meet Americans face to face.\"\n\nAnd the Queen City will be one of the places he visits.\n\nDokoupil, an Emmy Award-winning journalist, launchs his \"CBS Evening News\" tenure with a 10-day \"Live from America\" roadtrip, which kicks off in Miami, Florida. The show comes to Cincinnati on Jan. 15.\n\nFair. Fearless. A New @CBSEveningNews with @tonydokoupil .\n\nLive from your cities and towns.\nBe there, only on CBS. pic.twitter.com/T4mDMKsa5T\n\n— CBS News (@CBSNews) December 10, 2025\n\nIn a Dec. 18 press release, CBS News said Dokoupil, who is replacing John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois, is \"meeting people where they are — sharing the most urgent, important stories with Americans, rather than talking to them.\"\n\nHe will \"offer a fuller picture of the country, a closer look at the neighbors they share it with and the challenges we face together,\" the release continued.\n\nIn the CBS announcement, Dokoupil said, \"growing up a bit ramshackle, moving between Florida, Maryland and West Virginia, traveling the country playing high school and college baseball, I learned to love talking to new people.\"\n\n\"As a journalist, I realized there are some things you’ll never understand until you’re standing there with the people in the middle of it. Being there, and bringing others there, is what I love most about this job, and what makes me so excited about this trip,\" he said.\n\nCBS News is currently facing backlash for pulling a \"60 Minutes\" segment in the U.S. before it was set to air Dec. 21.\n\nThe segment was set to feature the notorious El Salvador prison CECOT.\n\nThe news program announced the programming update in a statement around 4:30 p.m. ET Dec. 21, adding the piece \"will air in a future broadcast.\"\n\n\"We determined it needed additional reporting,\" CBS News said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\nSharyn Alfonsi, a correspondent who has worked at the network for more than two decades, reported the piece. Multiple outlets, including The New York Times, NPR and CNN, obtained an email Alfonsi sent to colleagues in which she said the decision to pull the segment \"is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.\"\n\nShe also reportedly said the piece was screened five times and cleared by attorneys. USA TODAY was not able to reach Alfonsi.\n\n\"60 Minutes,\" instead, aired a segment on a family of classical musicians, the programming update said. The show's social media comments have since been flooded with viewers calling on the network to release the original clip, although it apparently aired in Canada, according to USA TODAY.\n\nParamount, which owns CBS, has faced a year of shakeups. The company in October acquired the independent media company The Free Press and named its CEO, Bari Weiss, CBS News' editor-in-chief.\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Melina Khan contributed to this report.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Why 'CBS Evening News' will soon broadcast from Cincinnati",

That frustration is what Mark Cuban, the self-made billionaire and longtime Shark Tank investor, decided to unpack on his own — without being asked.\n\nIn January, Cuban returned to his personal site, Blog Maverick, after a long stretch of silence. \"I haven't published anything on here in a long, long time.. Thought it would be fun to start up again,\" he wrote. He said the post was meant to be informal and exploratory. \"I wanted to give some stream of consciousness thoughts on how I think we can ‘fix' the economics of healthcare..

Providers provide that care. Patients get a bill and if they can afford it, they pay that bill. That's it.\"\n\nIn his view, everything else is secondary. \"The ONLY question in healthcare should be ‘How should care for people who can't afford to pay for their care be paid?'\" he wrote. The rest, he suggested, is noise layered onto a transaction that used to be straightforward.\n\nTrending: GM-Backed EnergyX Is Solving the Lithium Supply Crisis — Invest Before They Scale Global Production\n\nCuban also took aim at how pricing gets obscured. He criticized bundled charges, markups on basic supplies, and contracts so complex they hide real costs. Publishing prices alone doesn't solve it, he argued, when \"everyone bundles and upcodes and plays games.\"\n\nInsurance companies, he wrote, are a major source of that distortion. Managing and administering payments alone can add 20% to 30% in overhead, before accounting for fraud and overbilling. \"That's real money,\" Cuban said, especially in a system he estimates costs about $5 trillion a year.",

Epstein\" addressed to Larry Nassar, the disgraced Team USA gymnastics doctor who sexually abused scores of women and girls, appeared to reference then-President Donald Trump and claimed the president loved \"young, nubile girls.\"\n\nThe note, apparently handwritten by Jeffrey Epstein while he was in jail awaiting sex trafficking charges, was postmarked on Aug. 13, 2019, three days after the disgraced financier was found dead by suicide in his cell.\n\nThe note, addressed to \"L.N.,\" seems to reference Epstein's intention to die by suicide.\n\n\"As you know by now, I have taken the 'short route' home,\" the note reads. \"Good luck! We share one thing … our love & caring for young ladies at the hope they’d reach their full potential.\"\n\nThough the note does not mention Trump by name, it does appear to reference him, as he was president at the time of Epstein's death.\n\n\"Our president shares our love of young, nubile girls,\" the note reads. \"When a young beauty walked by he loved to 'grab snatch,' whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair. Yours, J.

Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted in 2021 of sex trafficking for recruiting and grooming underage girls for Epstein, also appears in several images.\n\nThe photos include a number of high-profile figures, such as former President Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Michael Jackson and Kevin Spacey, none of whom are accused of criminal wrongdoing. The images were released without context and have several faces redacted.\n\nTrump was also pictured with Epstein in photos that were taken down from the official website and eventually put back up following backlash.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nThe information contained in the files is separate from the thousands of documents given to the House Oversight Committee by Epstein's estate.\n\nTrump's name appears multiple times in the emails, including when Epstein questioned the president's mental state and implied he \"knew about the girls\" being trafficked.",

    "fullText": "On Saturday, Dec. 20, a woman discovered a deadly snake latched onto her sneaker while taking part in an outdoor activity in south-west Sydney, Australia\n\nShe was hospitalized as it was unclear if the marks on her legs were snake bites or scratches from the bushland\n\n\"Any sudden movement could cause the snake to react,\" said Snake catcher Cory Kerewaro\n\nA woman is receiving treatment for suspected snake bites after a deadly, venomous reptile latched onto her sneaker in Australia.\n\nHaving jumped out of a garden bed and run onto the road, the woman shook her leg, thinking a leaf had wrapped around it. She was shocked to see a snake attached to her shoe, said snake catcher Cory Kerewaro, who goes by Reptile Relocation Sydney on social media.\n\n\"The minute she realized it was a snake, she stayed still,\" Kerewaro told 9News.com, adding that an ambulance was called before he was contacted for assistance at around 3:30 p.m local time.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nRecalling the incident on Facebook, Kerewaro wrote, “Saturday afternoon’s job was without a doubt the most bizarre call I’ve ever attended. They advised that if the snake could still be present, and they needed it removed before they could safely treat the patient. Ambulance were already on the way.”\n\nKerewaro confirmed the reptile was an eastern brown snake after receiving a photo before he arrived at the scene. The deadly creature had “become completely wedged” in the small loop at the back of the woman’s sneaker.\n\n“The odds of that happening are almost nil. It was absolutely unreal,” he wrote. “At that point, everything changed.”\n\nAn eastern brown snake can reportedly kill in less than 15 minutes, Kerewaro told ABC.\n\n“This lady was standing in the middle of the road on a 36–38°C day, with an Eastern Brown Snake stuck in her shoe,” he continued on Facebook.\n\n“Brown snakes are highly reactive when stressed, and there was nowhere to take cover, nowhere to approach from safely, and no room for error,\" Kerewaro said. \"Any sudden movement could cause the snake to react.”\n\nUpon arrival, Kerewaro saw that the snake had signs of \"heat stress “and wasn’t as reactive as it normally would be.”\n\nHe “carefully pinned the snake” before cutting the small loop to free the woman.\n\nHaving been hospitalized following the incident, the woman later told Kerewaro that she suspected that she'd been bitten multiple times.\n\n\"There were some marks on her legs, which they weren't sure whether they were bite marks or just scratches from the bushland,\" NSW Ambulance acting duty operations manager Linda Evans told ABC. \"As a precaution, we treated it as snake bite … we applied a bandage to the area, a box splint for limb immobilization.”\n\nShe added, \"Our intensive care paramedics carry certain medications that can assist in slowing down the onset of those symptoms … we make sure the patient is stable and get them as quickly as possible to a hospital that carries an antivenene.\"\n\nPEOPLE has contacted the NSW Ambulance for comment.",

    "description": "Archaeologists found ancient tools in Spain, revealing the daily life and agricultural practices of early Neolithic societies from over 7,000 years ago.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nResearchers at a dig site in Spain discovered tools from some of the first farmers, possibly dating back 7,000 years.\n\nThe artifacts uncovered during the excavation are from the Neolithic period, one of the most pivotal revolutions in human history.\n\nAnimal remains found during the dig allude to Neolithic husbandry practices.\n\nNew evidence uncovered at a dig site in Huesca, Spain, gives us a snapshot into what daily agricultural practices may have looked like more than 7,000 years ago.\n\nThe Huerto Raso dig site was originally found in 1969 by Ignacio Barandiarán, and the area underwent its first excavation in 1972, which confirmed its occupation during the Neolithic period. Now, more than 50 years later, researchers from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) and the University of Zaragoza picked up where Barandiarán left off with an extensive dig campaign that lasted all of July 2024.\n\nAccording to a press release from UAB, this is the first major excavation on the site, as all past efforts were only partial surveys of the area.\n\nDuring the campaign, researchers documented the seasonal presence and possible later occupation of Neolithic groups—nomadic societies transitioning to a stationary, agricultural way of life between 5500 and 3000 BCE. The scientists recovered bone remains from consumed animals at the site, and said that hunted animal remains (rather than domesticated) stood out numerically among the bones.\n\nExcavation team members also unearthed artifacts including flint tools, ceramics and mills, and even structures that could have been used for shelter. The UAB release said researchers plan to analyze the artifacts using carbon-14 dating, residue analysis, and other methods to further understand the agricultural practices and subsistence strategies of inhabitants.\n\n“The discoveries made are important not only for the academic field,” the press release stated, “but also enrich the cultural heritage of the region.”\n\nHuerto Raso is located in the Vero River Cultural Park and is surrounded by historically rich areas, including over 50 sites with post-Paleolithic rock art.\n\n“The site of Huerto Raso is a window to the past that allows us to better understand the development of human societies during the ancient Neolithic in the pre-Pyrenean area,” Alejandro Sierra, a researcher at UAB, said in the press release.\n\nThe pre-Pyrenean area, or pre-Pyrenees, refers to the foothills of the Pyrenees mountain range, which spans Catalonia, Aragon, and Navarra in Spain. Other research in the area has produced similar findings to Huerto Raso. A study published in the journal Open Archaeology analyzed findings from the Cova Colomera dig site in Serra del Montsec, Spain.\n\nLike the excavation in Huerto Raso, the work in Cova Colomera also unearthed remains from animals. Researchers used the bones that were likely from livestock to conclude that “the natural resources of the pre-Pyrenees were exploited by the earliest shepherds in the Early Neolithic.”\n\nHumans began moving from small, nomadic bands to early farming civilizations during the Neolithic period. According to National Geographic, historians have several theories as to why the Neolithic Revolution, also known as the Agricultural Revolution, began: population pressure, reliance on certain plants, and even creating a more cohesive, productive society are all possibilities.\n\nThe Neolithic fundamentally changed how humans interacted with land, animals and each other, and organizational practices developed during the time can be traced to the present day, making the period responsible for one of humanity’s most important revolutions.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts are meeting a familiar face in a must win game in week seventeen. If the game against the 49ers wasn’t brutal enough for the defense, this one might be worse as the Jaguars are rolling into town red-hot. This is an absolute must win for the Colts. A win this week, coupled with a loss by the Texans, leaves them in a week eighteen showdown. Lose and the season is over. FanDuel Sportsbook is laying the Colts as sizeable underdogs with a +6.5-spread.\n\nThe money line starts at +265 while the over/under comes in at 47.5.\n\nPhilip Rivers looked the part on Monday night, leading his team on two touchdown drives to start the game. He came out firing and looked completely different than he did against the Seahawks. Balls were flying downfield and he was putting it on his receivers. The Colts had 19 first downs but were hurt by a few penalties that killed drives. Putting up 27-points will win some games in the NFL; giving up 48 will lose you all of them. The defense couldn’t have been worse. That is a literal statement. The only time they got off the field is when the 49ers missed a 64-yard field goal, but even then, they allowed them a crack at it with 17 seconds on the clock. The poor end of half execution was exactly what they did against the Seahawks. Tack on five touchdowns and it quickly became a blowout loss.\n\nThe Jaguars just keep getting better. They are quickly entering the conversation of Super Bowl hopeful, especially after they laid the smackdown on the Broncos in Denver. After falling behind 7-10, the Jaguars went on a run in the second half fueled by a strong third quarter. Trevor Lawrence had four touchdowns and is looking like the franchise quarterback the Jaguars have been waiting on to fully come into his own. Putting up 34-points on the Broncos’ defense on the road is no easy task. Week in and week out, the Jaguars are making this type of performance routine.\n\nThe Colts are running into buzzsaw. If the defense doesn’t get things figured out, it will be another track meet in which the Colts will have no chance. Philip Rivers demonstrated he can put points on the board, but he can’t hang a 50-spot. The Jaguars have momentum and are eyeing moving up in the AFC standings. The Colts will do all they can to hang on.",

    "title": "9 Takeaways from Cavs 139-132 win over Hornets: ‘We didn’t crack any code’",
    "description": "The Cavs took a step in the right direction, but it doesn’t mean much if they can’t build on this performance.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers picked up a much-needed win on Monday. The offense was clicking in a way that we’ve rarely seen this season, resulting in a 139-132 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nFor one night, everything seemed alright with the Cavs.\n\n“There were no boos in the crowd tonight, so that was really good,” Darius Garland joked postgame. “And a lot more cheers. So we’re trying to get back to Cavaliers’ basketball.”\n\nThe offense gave the fans plenty to cheer about. The Cavs went 24-44 (54.5%) from outside the arc. It was the team’s most made threes and their highest three-point percentage for a single game this season.\n\nThe Cavaliers’ offense was artificially boosted by a hot-shooting night. They aren’t going to connect on over 50% of their outside attempts often. But they were also creating good looks by making the extra pass. Thirty-five of the team’s 48 field-goal makes were assisted. This includes 20 of their 24 three-point makes.\n\nThe Cavs did an excellent job of getting inside the paint and then kicking out for open outside attempts. They weren’t static, pull-up threes, or even shots from just moving the ball from side to side. The offense was getting downhill, and everything flowed from there.\n\nThe process was exactly what you’d want it to be on that end of the court.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the defense remains incredibly frustrating to watch. The Cavs are seemingly always in rotation, chasing the ball. And more often than not, the ball finds the open man before the defense can recover.\n\nThese aren’t the traits of a respectable defense.\n\nAnything bought from the links helps support Fear the Sword. You can find this comfortable Cuyahoga Valley National Park hoodie HERE. All of of Homage’s Cavs gear can be found HERE.\n\nThere’s more than a few factors that contribute to this. The point-of-attack resistance remains poor. They don’t have many plus defenders on the perimeter, or at the very least, they don’t have anyone who you can put on a team’s best scorer and expect them to make life difficult for them. This causes the defense to help, get in rotation, and there’s only so much you can do once you’re behind the play.\n\nOn top of that, the Cavs are insistent on trying to play this fast, trapping defense that forces turnovers. And to their credit, they’ve done that this season as they came into this game sixth in defensive turnover percentage. But like the emphasis on offensive rebounding, the effort they put into forcing turnovers may not actually be worth it.\n\nThere’s no one stat to show exactly that the team is trapping too much and giving up open shots because of it. But opponents came into Monday’s game shooting 37.2% from three against them, which is the sixth-highest mark in the league. On top of that, they’re giving up their highest percentage of shots at the rim since 2020-21. Both point to a team that isn’t consistently in its proper spots on the floor.\n\nWhile this is an offense-led group, the defense needs to be considerably better than it’s been lately if they want to get back into contention.\n\n“It’s not great,” head coach Kenny Atkinson said about the defense. “We got to get better defensively. It’s funny, the first 19 games, I think we were fifth in the league [defensively], and we’ve just had this dip defensively.”\n\nRebounding also remains a problem. The Hornets grabbed 46% of their missed shots (98th percentile). This led to a 20-7 second-chance points advantage for Charlotte.\n\n“We’re not a good rebounding team,” Atkinson said. “That’s the last phase of defense. We got to get better.”\n\nThe Cavs did a much better job of getting back in transition against Charlotte, but were beaten consistently on the glass and off-the-dribble on the perimeter.\n\nThere are simply too many holes in the defense right now. Whenever one is plugged, two more seem to pop up.\n\nDe’Andre Hunter finally broke out of his slump. He scored 27 points on 9-13 shooting. A decent amount of those baskets came after getting elbowed in the face.\n\nThis was a game he needed badly. Hunter came into this game averaging 12.1 points on 38.9% shooting from the floor and 28.9% shooting from three. This cold streak resulted in Hunter recently being moved back to the bench.\n\nIt’s a decision Hunter says he agrees with.\n\n“Just going off the results,” Hunter said. “It wasn’t looking too great. … The numbers said it wasn’t working great. So [we’ll] just try to look for a different outcome.”\n\nGarland looked like his All-Star self for the second straight game. He backed up his encouraging performance against the Chicago Bulls by pouring in 27 points and 10 assists against Charlotte. He was able to once again create separation off the dribble — which is something he struggled to do when he first came back from injury.\n\nThe concern is whether or not Garland’s toe can hold up throughout a full season. He seemed to get banged up again down the stretch of Monday’s game, but confirmed afterward that he was okay after being asked about it repeatedly.\n\nGarland is the key to the Cavs’ offense working. As talented as Donovan Mitchell is, Garland is the one who organizes the attack by getting the bigs involved and controlling the tempo. The ball has more life when he’s playing like this.\n\nThe Cavs will go as far as their offense takes them. And their offense is only elite when their quarterback is in there playing near the level Garland has recently.\n\nMitchell benefits greatly from playing with this version of Garland.\n\nLast season showed that their games complement each other quite well offensively. Mitchell needs someone who can set up an offense, while Garland is helped by having another guard there to carry some of the scoring burden.\n\nThat was on display Tuesday when both were able to do what they do best.\n\n“I try to create as much advantages as I can for him just to get rolling, get some open ones,” Garland said about Mitchell. “He’s always gonna have the best defender on him. So, anything to get him open just for a split second, because he can do whatever with the ball. That’s all of our jobs. So, I’m trying to make his life a lot easier so he don’t have to keep running around with some of the best defenders in the world.”\n\nMitchell scored 30 points on 10-18 shooting on a night Atkinson said he “wasn’t as sharp” as normal. That speaks to the incredible standard that Mitchell has set this season.\n\nThis was a much-needed win for the Cavs. They demonstrated that they still can be the offensive juggernaut they were last regular season. At the same time, this is what a good team is supposed to do against the 24th-ranked defense.\n\nWhile this was an encouraging offensive performance, this win on its own doesn’t mean much if they can’t find a way to build on it.\n\n“We didn’t crack any code,” Mitchell said. “This isn’t a victory lap because we won tonight. We did it once, now ultimately, we got to do it on a consistent basis.”",

The Bengals can beat up on bad ones — we saw that on Sunday in Miami — but that’s about the ceiling. Considering the Bengals finish the season with home games against the Cardinals and Browns, it’s not hard to imagine a small winning streak to close things out.\n\nThe question is: Riding that winning streak into what, exactly?\n\nWinning out would leave the Bengals with a 7–10 record in 2025. The Cowboys finished 7–10 in 2024 and landed the No. 12 overall pick, which they used on Alabama guard Tyler Booker. The year before that, Bo Nix went No. 12. The year before that, it was Jahmyr Gibbs.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the Bengals would pick 12th, or that they’d use that pick on someone who could immediately help. In fact, they’ve moved away from that approach almost entirely. We’re only just now seeing the early returns on Myles Murphy, a 2023 first-round pick. That’s not how winning teams operate.\n\nSo what else does 7–10 get you?\n\nAnother year of Al Golden, Duke Tobin, and Zac Taylor.\n\nTo be fair, it’s just as likely that the trio sticks around even if the Bengals lose out and finish 5–12. But winning out practically guarantees it.\n\nWhat will Golden, Tobin, and Taylor give Bengals fans in 2026 and beyond? We won’t know until we get there —but statistically, it’s more of what we’ve seen the last three seasons.\n\nThat’s football-shaped poop, if you were curious.\n\nYes, it was fun watching Joe Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins, Chase Brown, and the most expensive offense in the NFL bully a team so bad they recently demoted their former No. 5 overall pick to emergency third quarterback. But it doesn’t do anything for the franchise. If anything, it further handcuffs the Bengals to Taylor longer than they should be.\n\nAgain, he’s not going anywhere, regardless, but this is how the front office will justify a decision they’ve already made.\n\nI don’t need a crystal ball to see the future. Mike Brown and the Blackburns are painfully predictable.\n\nNobody would eat crow with a bigger smile on their face than me if they do.\n\nAll that said, winning is still more fun than losing. I’m not rooting for the Bengals to lose. I am saying we shouldn’t be surprised when no meaningful changes are made—and the way the season ended becomes the justification.\n\nEdit: My wife said this was too dark for a win, and I need to add some good since the Bengals embarrassed the Dolphins on the road, and winning on the road is hard.\n\nSo here’s a compliment sandwich:\n\n-The defense looked the best they have all season, and I’m happy they didn’t allow Ewers, who was making his first start, to beat up the secondary.\n\n-They need to be better at stopping the run.\n\n-I’m always down to see the Bengals put up 45 points and pull Burrow with almost an entire quarter left. Bravo!\n\nI love seeing Tee Higgins score touchdowns. I love watching Chase and Higgins scare the absolute pants off opposing secondaries like they did in Miami. I also know Higgins is coming off multiple concussions that forced him to miss time. If the outcome of the game doesn’t matter, is it worth risking your brain? I know players want to play. I get it. It’s just an uncomfortable reality of the sport.\n\nChase Brown has emerged as one of the most explosive running backs in the league. I worried Burrow’s return might push him back into the background, but instead it’s unlocked him even more as a receiver. Brown has one year left on his rookie deal. 2026 could be a big year — for him and, hopefully, the Bengals.\n\nI really like what I’m seeing from Myles Murphy. It’s not enough to crown him Trey Hendrickson’s heir just yet, but right now, he’s a solid depth piece, and there’s reason to believe the ceiling can rise with more development.\n\nShemar Stewart didn’t do much as a pass rusher, but he was solid against the run. That’s better than nothing, I guess — but rushing the passer needs to be priority one, two, and three this offseason.\n\nI’m thrilled the Bengals signed Mike Gesicki to a multi-year deal.\n\nI’m also not surprised by how well Jalen Davis has played when called upon. Do people not remember him backing up Mike Hilton in the Mad Scientist’s defense?\n\nThe Bengals absolutely need to lock up Dalton Risner. They also need to continue addressing the position, but Risner has been a breath of fresh air at guard for Burrow—rock steady in pass protection.\n\nA 27-yard Drew Sample reception on a broken play? Yes please. I’ll take another.\n\nWe saw improved play from rookie linebackers Demetrius Knight Jr. and Barrett Carter—but it came against Quinn Ewers and the Dolphins. I’m not sold yet.\n\nI hope you and yours have the most wonderful holiday season, no matter how or what you celebrate! Maybe next year we’ll get the gift of playoff football in Cincinnati once again.\n\nAnd when those blue snowflakes start falling\nThat’s when those blue memories start calling\nYou’ll be doing all right\nWith your Christmas of white\nBut I’ll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas",

    "description": "When the 1930 tournament was staged in Uruguay, some nations could not afford the trip, players did not take it seriously and fights were common. What has changed since then.",
    "fullText": "Next summer’s World Cup will be the largest, most complex and most lucrative sporting event in history, with 48 teams playing 104 games in three countries. The tournament is expected to draw a global TV audience of nearly 5 billion and FIFA, the event’s organizer, is hoping for revenues of between $10 billion-$14 billion — which is why lower-bowl tickets for Iran-New Zealand at SoFi Stadium cost nearly $700.\n\nAll that seemed unlikely after the first tournament in 1930, when the idea of a soccer World Cup was nearly killed in the cradle, the victim from lack of planning, lack of money and lack of interest. That the competition survived, much less thrived, is nothing short of a miracle, says English writer and podcaster Jonathan Wilson, author of the deeply researched “The Power and Glory: The History of the World Cup.”\n\n“1930, it’s incredibly amateurish in many ways,” Wilson said. “It’s got that sort of almost like a school sports day feel to it.”\n\nOnly 13 countries took part in the first tournament; it was supposed to be 16 but the Egyptian team missed its boat to Uruguay while Japan and Siam (now Thailand) couldn’t afford the travel costs and pulled out. England, meanwhile, not only refused to play, but the British press ignored the event, as did much of Europe.\n\nThat seemed like a wise decision at the time since the first two matches of the inaugural tournament were affected by snow, with one of the opening games drawing just 4,444 fans. The smallest crowd in World Cup history, estimated at about 300, showed up for another first-round game between Romania and Peru and the TV audience … well, there was none since TV had yet to be invented.\n\nThe officiating was beyond suspect — Romania’s manager, Constantin Radulescu, also worked two games as a linesman — and the U.S. trainer, Jack Coll, had to be stretchered off the field during his team’s semifinal — yes, the U.S. made the semifinals! — with Argentina when he lost consciousness after inhaling the fumes from a bottle of chloroform that shattered in his pocket.\n\nIn another game, the penalty spots were mistakenly marked 16 yards from goal instead of the regulation 12 — and nobody noticed.\n\n“Some of the details don’t make sense,” Wilson said. “The whole thing is so sort of low grade compared to today.”\n\nWhen Argentine captain Nolo Ferreira left the tournament and returned home to take his law exams his replacement, Guillermo Stábile, scored a tournament-high eight goals in four games — then never played for the national team again (although he did coach it, leading the La Albiceleste to six South American titles and the 1958 World Cup).\n\nGiven the farcical nature of the 1930 World Cup, the tournament probably should have ended right there. Instead, 1930 has become the foundation on which next year’s competition was built.\n\nThe origins of the tournament, however, actually make sense. Before 1930, FIFA recognized the winner of the Olympic competition as the world champion. But that event was for amateurs, a point on which the International Olympic Committee would not budge.\n\nWith professional soccer growing in popularity, FIFA decided to stage its own breakaway event and play it in Uruguay, the country that had won the last two Olympic titles.\n\nThat quickly proved to be a big mistake. The growing effects of the Great Depression left many countries unable to afford the long, slow steamship trip to South America. The first tournament was open to any country that wanted to play, yet two months before the first game no European teams had agreed to come.\n\n“It was taken very seriously by Uruguay and Argentina,” Wilson said, but not by many others.\n\nThat changed shortly after Romania’s King Carol II, who ascended to the throne in a coup that deposed his son, personally selected his country’s World Cup roster and sent it on its way. France quickly agreed to go too, entering a makeshift team under pressure from FIFA president Jules Rimet, a Frenchman. Belgium also buckled under FIFA pressure and all three teams boarded the same ship for the trip to Uruguay, working out together on the 15-day voyage aboard the SS Conte Verde, an Italian ocean liner.\n\n“Even the four European nations who go it’s not entirely clear how seriously they took it,” Wilson said. “The French and Romanians, they kept diaries. They seem to have regarded this as a laugh. We’ll try to win but it doesn’t really matter.”\n\nThings didn’t really get loony until the tournament began. The Bolivian team, for example, played in berets, as did an Argentine midfielder, while the 15 referees who worked the games, some of whom had traveled and socialized with the players on the long boat ride from Europe, dressed formally in knickers, long-sleeve shirts, blazers and ties.\n\nThe well-dressed officials spent much of the tournament working with police to break up fights; play was so violent at least two players sustained broken legs and the U.S.-Argentina semifinal descended into a full-out brawl, with one American having four teeth knocked out and another hospitalized with injuries to his stomach.\n\nThe tournament finally finished with the hosts beating Argentina 4-2, after which the Argentines broke off diplomatic relations with their neighbor and an angry mob in Buenos Aires stoned the Uruguayan embassy.\n\n“It ended,” Wilson said of the tournament, “with everybody sort of fighting each other.”\n\nFew disagreed with the Argentine magazine El Gráfico, which seemed to predict there was little future for the fledgling event. “The World Cup is over,” it wrote. “The development of this competition brought not only an unpleasant atmosphere, but also an ungrateful one.”\n\nYet nearly a century later, the World Cup is still here. And that, too, was foretold in 1930 in the story of Romanian midfielder Alfred Eisenbeisser (who was also known as Fredi Fieraru because, why not?).\n\nOn the journey home from the first World Cup, Eisenbeisser contracted pneumonia and a priest was called to administer the last rites. The ship eventually docked in Genoa and he was taken to a sanatorium while the rest of the team continued on to Romania.\n\nAssuming her son had perished in Italy, Eisenbeisser’s mother arranged a wake — only to have her son stroll into the ceremony very much alive, causing the woman to faint. Eisenbeisser would play 12 more years of professional soccer and compete in figure skating in the 1936 Winter Olympics, where he finished 13th in the pairs competition.\n\nTurns out the reports of Eisenbeisser’s demise, like those of the World Cup, were greatly exaggerated.\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

    "fullText": "The future of high school football is here, and it’s burning bright. From California to Florida, Texas to Pennsylvania, gridiron stars have performed all across the country the past few months to electrify on Friday nights. We’re unveiling our Sophomore All-American list – the names you need to know now, because you’ll be hearing about them all throughout the off-season and into 2026. These athletes aren’t just talented; they’re the game-changers from this past 2025 high school football campaign.\n\nQB: Lukas Prock, Hun School\nWe’d be hard pressed to not have Prock heading up this list as the country’s top quarterback when you look at production, talent and competition he faced in 2025. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound quarterback went up against the likes of teams in Archbishop Spalding (Md.), The St. James Academy (Md.), St. Frances Academy (Md.), The First Academy and IMG Academy. The signal caller finished the season completing 226 of 309 passes for 4,330 yards and 41 touchdowns.\n\nRB: Xander Edwards, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nEdwards had himself a breakout season playing for the FHSAA Class 2A state semifinalist Bolles bulldogs. The sophomore running back averaged a ridiculous 9.9 yards per carry and rushed for 2,629 and scored 44 times on the ground. Add in his 17 catches for 211 yards and Edwards finishes just shy of 3,000 all-purpose yards for the 2025 season.\n\nRB: Zaiden Jernigan, Louisville (MS)\nJernigan made his name well known throughout the Magnolia State this past 2025 season as the running back put up some of the top numbers of any back in the country when it came to sophomores. The running back rushed for 1,563 yards on 238 carries and scored 20 touchdowns. The sophomore also added 205 yards and four touchdowns out of the backfield.\n\nWR: Roye Oliver, Hamilton (Ariz.)\nOliver was as good as advertised anytime he took the field for Hamilton, finishing the season catching 92 passes for 1,839 yards and scoring 29 touchdowns. There’s little doubt that Oliver is one of the country’s best wide receivers, regardless of class as he proved himself this 2025 campaign.\n\nWR: Brysen Wright, Mandarin (Fla.)\nThe four-star do-everything has done it all just about for Mandarin this past season, with Wright catching 46 passes for 983 yards and 10 touchdowns. Wright has also seen plenty of time on the defensive side of the ball as well, notching 63 tackles and intercepting five passes. The sophomore also contributed in the punt return game, totaling 254 yards on six returns.\n\nWR: Eric McFarland, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nThough McFarland reclassified to the Class of 2027, he was considered a sophomore throughout the entire 2025 high school football season. McFarland has shown his versatility not only going downfield, but also on jet sweeps, pop passes and even just taking hand-offs. Through nine games, McFarland caught 29 passes for 595 yards and scored 11 touchdowns.\n\nOT: R’Monie Edwards, Cypress Ranch (TX)\nAt 6-foot-5, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle was near impossible to get by for opposing defensive ends down in the Lone Star State. Rated a four-star by the Rivals Industry Rankings, Edwards led the way up front for over 4,500 all-purpose yards, 58 touchdowns and 463 points scored in 2025.\n\nOL: Elisha Mueller, Servite (Calif.)\nPlaying up against some of the top high school football programs in the land, Mueller held his own and then some for the Friars. Mueller is interchangeable at either guard position and led the way for Servite’s offense that totaled over 3,500 all-purpose yards and 39 touchdowns.\n\nC: Hunter Hill, Peach County (Ga.)\nHill can play center or at either guard position as he did during the 2025 season for the 10-2 Peach County Trojans. The 6-foot-3, 305-pound interior offensive lineman was superb in Year 2 and helped the Trojans amass 4,500-plus yards of offense and scoring 58 total touchdowns.\n\nOL: George Selvie III, Sumner (Fla.)\nFamiliar with the name? That’s because his father, George Selvie, starred at USF and eventually in the NFL. Now the younger Selvie plays for his father at Sumner and has blossomed into one of the top offensive linemen in the country when it comes to sophomores. Selvie III paved the way for over 3,800 yards and 45 touchdowns for the Class 7A region finalist Stingrays.\n\nOT: Jamarios Canton, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nProtecting the right side of Jayden Wade on Friday nights, Canton proved anytime out on the field that he was the top offensive tackle of the 2028 class. At 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, the offensive tackle took on all comers and right out of the gates against Hoover (Ala.) was pancaking opposing defensive linemen.\n\nAll-Purpose: Gaige Weddle, Rancho Bernardo (Calif.)\nI mean, what didn’t Weddle do for Rancho Bernardo in 2025? The dual-threat quarterback threw for 2,224 yards and 19 touchdowns through the air. Weddle led the team in rushing with 679 yards on just 98 attempts and 10 scores. Oh and Weddle also led the team on defense with 101 tackles, two sacks and two interceptions. Like we said, what didn’t Weddle do? He was what you want in a all-purpose athlete.\n\nEdge: Asher Ghioto, The Bolles School (Fla.)\nNo matter where Ghioto lined up on the defensive line, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound EDGE rusher was causing havoc for opposing offensive linemen. Ghioto finished the season totaling 84 tackles, 35 for a loss and 23 sacks.\n\nDT: Kellan Hall, Christian Academy of Louisville (KY)\nAnchoring the Centurions’ defensive line all throughout their undefeated 15-0 run to the KHSAA Class 3A state championship. Hall recently received defensive first-team all-state honors playing on the defensive line. When it comes to interior defensive linemen, there’s very few as agile and quick like the 6-foot-4, 255-pound stalwart.\n\nDT: Cory Cunningham, Providence (N.C.)\nThe four-star 6-foot-4, 265-pound defensive tackle was a force in North Carolina’s Class 8A throughout the season. Cunningham was unblockable for many opposing offensive linemen as the defensive tackle racked up 60 tackles, 28 going for a loss and 15 quarterback takedowns.\n\nEdge: Jackson Vaughn, Bergen Catholic (N.J.)\nJust because the numbers might’ve went down a little from his freshman campaign doesn’t mean that Vaughn didn’t remain a factor when it came to EDGE rushers. Teams took notice and Vaughn faced plenty of double and even triple teams. The edge rusher compiled 40 tackles, 12 for a loss and eight sacks.\n\nOLB: Judah Blair, Lakota West (OH)\nBlair at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds moves like a safety, but can hit you like a ton of bricks like a linebacker. The sophomore backer had a strong year in the linebacking corps for Lakota West, tallying 57 tackles, 15.5 going for a loss, three sacks and an interception.\n\nLB: Tahj Gray, St. Joseph Regional (N.J.)\nThe sophomore linebacker proved himself on the highest level of of New Jersey high school football, helping the St. Joseph Regional Green Knights win the NJSIAA Non-Public A state championship. Gray last season ended with 102 total tackles, 10.5 for a loss, four sacks and four passes broken up.\n\nLB: Nehemiah McCary, Maplesville (Ala.)\nMcCrary was a two-way force for Maplesville this past season as the Red Devils went on to win Alabama’s Class 1A state championship. The 6-foot-2, 225-pound linebacker’s performance in the state title game came on the offensive end of the ball where McCrary rushed for 182 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCB: A’mir Sears, West Broward (Fla.)\nOne of the biggest reasons why West Broward made it all the way to Florida’s Class 6A state championship game was the play of the four-star athlete. Sears was dynamic on both sides of the ball, with the sophomore making 61 tackles, breaking up 11 passes and intercepting three others. On offense, Sears led the Bobcats with 942 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nCB: Langston Pridgeon, Stone Bridge (Va.)\nMany opposing quarterbacks thought twice before throwing to Pridgeon’s side of the field in 2025. Ranked as one of the top cornerbacks in the country, Pridgeon proved himself to being one of Virginia’s best players in the Bulldogs’ defensive secondary. Whether its playing in man or zone coverages, the sophomore excelled in his sophomore campaign.\n\nS: Casey Barner, McEachern (Ga.)\nHonestly, Barner could’ve been put at a multitude of spots on this list but his natural position is at safety and there was little doubt of his talents from the moment he stepped onto the field this season. In McEachern’s season-opening win 50-17 win over Walton, Barner compiled 341 all-purpose yards and three touchdowns.\n\nS: Giovanni Tuggle, Winder-Barrow (Ga.)\nIt’s an all-Georgia safety duo with Tuggle paired with Barner in the first team defensive backfield. Tuggle saw extensive playing time for the Bulldogs this past 2025 season as the four-star safety totaled 74 tackles, five pass breakups and also intercepted four others.\n\nPK: Jack Ciancio, Phenix City Central (Ala.)\nThe sophomore kicker was automatic when it came to extra points for the Phenix City Red Devils this past season, knocking down all 75 of his attempts. Ciancio connected on 11 field goals, with a long of 38 yards.\n\nP: Israel Carmona, Queen Creek (Ariz.)\nPlacing punts inside of an opponent’s 20-yard line was a specialty of Carmona’s this past season as the sophomore pinned teams deep into their own territory 17 times. On 39 punt attempts, Carmona averaged 40.6 yards with a long of 58 on the season.\n\nReturn Specialist: Tyree Mannings, Venice (Fla.)\nMannings was superb stepping into the No. 1 receiver role at Venice after Winston Watkins Jr. graduated and had built a strong connection with Howard quarterback commit Darryon Jones. The Indians’ top wide receiver hauled in 84 passes for 1,429 yards and 12 touchdowns. Mannings was deadly in the kick return game, compiling 335 return yards for the Indians.\n\nQB: Koa Malau’ulu, St. John Bosco (Calif.)\nRB: Taihj Moore, Deland (Fla.)\nRB: Kameron Battle, Carrollwood Day (Fla.)\nWR: Jaylen Addai, Shadow Creek (TX)\nWR: Jett Harrison, St. Joseph’s Prep (Pa.)\nWR: TJ Maddox, Winslow Township (N.J.)\nOT: Bryce Smalls, Archbishop Spalding (Md.)\nOL: Kris Scott, Taft (OH)\nC: Carl Noisette, Duluth (Ga.)\nOL: Maxx Jones, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nOT: Azhir Waddell, Dudley (N.C.)\nAll-Purpose: Deandre Bidden, Harper Woods (Mich.)\n\nEdge: Jalanie George, Desert Edge (Ariz.)\nDT: Kingston Brown, Carver (Ga.) \nDT: Jameer Whyce, Trotwood-Madison (OH)\nEdge: Darieon Prescott, Bolingbrook (IL)\nLB: Tysir Young, Middletown (DE)\nLB: Brayden Bonik, Ridge Point (TX)\nCB: Man Robinson, IMG Academy (Fla.)\nCB: Jermaine Cobbins, Springfield (Tenn.)\nS: Pole Moala, Leuzinger (Calif.)\nS: James Foster III, Lancaster (TX)\n\nPK: Luke Marchionni, Hamilton Southeastern (IN)\nP: Julian Trujillo, Eaglecrest (CO)\nReturn Specialist: Dillon Mitchell, C.E.

    "fullText": "Chaim Bloom has made it a priority this offseason to strengthen the team’s pitching staff and depth as a primary goal. After trading veteran starting pitcher Sonny Gray to the Boston Red Sox before Thanksgiving and returning MLB-ready Richard Fitts and minor league upside starter Brandon Clarke, as well as the recent trade of First Basemen Willson Contreras, also to Boston, for Hunter Dobbins, Yhoiker Fajardo, and Blake Aita the front office continues to pursue pitching through trades and free agency. Even if all of the arms acquired this offseason don’t reach the major leagues thats okay because young controllable pitching is the single most sought-after commodity, and the surplus can be used to acquire and upgrade other areas of the roster that may be lacking when the time comes to compete once more. Other names on the block include Brendan Donovan, JoJo Romero, Lars Nootbaar, and Nolan Arenado.\n\nAfter trading away Ryan Helsley, Phil Maton, and Steven Matz at the deadline, non-tendering John King, and all but expecting JoJo Romero to be pitching elsewhere in 2026. Chaim Bloom has publicly spoken about a desire to have a veteran presence in the bullpen to help the young relievers mature as everyday big leaguers. From the outside, they view their pitch to prospective free agents as pointing towards Andrew Kittredge and Phil Maton and point out that if you come to St. Louis for a year, you can re-establish yourself to earn a larger payday where there are innings and opportunity aplenty! If/when JoJo Romero is traded away, the team will only have fringe 40-man arm Nick Raquet from the left side on the 40-man roster. The Cardinals could consider multiple left-handed options if that indeed comes to fruition.\n\nChaim Bloom has staunchly been against promoting players before they are fully ready to move up, which is why I don’t view Quinn Matthews, Brycen Mautz, Pete Hansen, Ixan Henderson, Liam Doyle, etc., as options for the bullpen at the beginning of the 2026 season. Matthews is still trying to master AAA, and none of the other four have even competed in Triple-A, so they don’t know how their stuff will perform with a new variable added to their situation, like pitching with the big league ball.\n\nWhen trying to scope out who could be a potential target or fit, we can look for clues in the profile of arms the team has already acquired under the new leadership’s guided focus. Going back to this year’s draft selecting Liam Doyle and Tanner Franklin, the trade deadline in acquiring Nate Dohm and Frank Ellisalt, the trade for Richard Fitts and Brandon Clarke, or even their Rule 5 selection in Matt Pushard. High octane fastball’s appear to be the vogue guiding light for their player development group. Of course, I always bring names to the table. I would never leave you, the reader, without something to chew on or consider, so here are three names from the left side and the right side who bring one of a big fastball, veteran leadership/experience, or a combination of the two!\n\n2025 – 39 G 4.63 ERA 4.25 FIP 3.86 xFIP 32 K 35 IP\n\nBorucki will remind some fans of JoJo Romero as he throws his Slider 41% of the time as his primary pitch and produced a whiff% of 37.7. Overall, he had a .117/.229/.150 with a .188 wOBA against 70 LHB last season. His Sinker sits in the 93-94 range, which is plenty hard enough when batters are trying to decipher between that and an 85 MPH sweeping slider. The 10 MPH of separation between speeds works well to keep hitters off balance and produce some pretty ugly swings and misses. Borucki is probably one of the best available left-handers who offers the combination of stuff, performance, and experience left available on the open market.\n\n2025 – 19 G 8.31 ERA 5.77 FIP 5.18 xFIP 21 K 21.2 IP\n\nFor a pitcher with as much octane as Perez has, he strangely generates a whiff rate below 25%, which is just a little below league average. Perez IS however, a soft contact merchant. His Barrel rate of 2.9% and groundball rate of 60.9 % would both rank in the 99th percentile if he had a qualified number of innings pitched last season. The 16.4 BB% is the real kicker with Cionel, and I don’t know how you remedy that in my limited understanding of pitching mechanics, but perhaps the Cardinals would. Sitting at 95.6 MPH on average from his fastball, he certainly fits the “throws gas” north star the front office has established. .265/.390/.324 .331 wOBA against 43 LHB last season, you can clearly tell that the walks were what bit him. The .324 SLG is more than good enough if Perez can keep the ball in the zone. Busch will keep the ball in the park, and perhaps the Cardinals could catch lightning in a bottle as Perez would be a sought-after commodity with an additional year of club control accruing just over 4 years of service time so far at the deadline if the Cardinals can hone him in.\n\n2025 – 48 G 4.52 ERA 4.57 FIP 4.30 xFIP 53 K 67.2 IP\n\nI talked about Suter at the beginning of the offseason, and I believe his existence on the roster would still add a lot of value. Suter is a Harvard grad and can pitch multiple innings in relief; he can serve as an opener, and he would allow Manager Oli Marmol more flexibility with his bullpen usage. He’s one of the quickest workers in the big leagues, and that matters on 100-degree St. Louis days to keep players from baking in the sun. Suter would also fit PERFECTLY as the bullpen mentor as a reigning Clemente Award nominee. Those are all the “glue” reasons why Suter would fit. His under-the-hood metrics would make him almost the antithesis of our “North Star type.” But, while his average fastball velocity is in the 1st percentile at 87.9, his extension of 7.5 ft put him in the 99th percentile, which, as we know, increases perceived velocity and makes pitches appear to come out faster than they are because theyre being released so much closer than hitters are used to. His average exit velo against is 99th percentile at 85.8 mph, his BB% is low at 6.2%, his hard hit rate is 96th percentile at 32.9%, and he generates groundballs at a 45.4% clip. 18.2 K% is below average but not non-existent, as he’s a veteran who knows how to pitch and can get a strikeout when he needs one. There isn’t a whole lot of upside to be had in this profile, but when you value a Swiss Army knife type pitcher who can pitch in a variety of roles and situations thats valuable to a team with a young staff to help navigate and get through a full 162.\n\n2025 – 65 G 5.30 ERA 4.40 FIP 4.98 xFIP 58 K 56 IP\n\nImagine the flexibility that a roster that contained both Brent Suter and Ryne Stanek would provide! Stanek is a little bit like Cionel Perez in that his inability to throw strikes consistently in 2025 is what really hurt his overall numbers. Stanek can really step on the gas pedal with his average fastball velocity at 98.5 MPH, which had him in the 96th percentile. The 12.5 BB% doesn’t help things, and he’s a flyball pitcher – that CAN work, pitching your home games at Busch. Chaim had Stanek in Tampa Bay and knows just what he’s capable of, having experience pitching in a multitude of roles from opening to closing. Think of Ryan Helsley with Stanek. The fastball is hard but straight, but the slider is the true equalizer, generating an over 45% whiff rate! The numbers Stanek posted last season won’t get him big money this offseason, but he sure provides his next team a lot of tools to work with that could get the most out of him in 2026.\n\n2025 – 30 G 5.08 ERA 4.95 FIP 4.23 xFIP 28 K 33.2 IP\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Shawn Dubin that’s okay. Drafted in the 13th round of the 2018 draft, Dubin throws 6 unique pitches and could be similar to Kyle Leahy before Leahy broke out in 2025. Dubin limits hard contact, keeps the ball on the ground, but is below league average when it comes to strikeout stuff, generating swing and miss, and enticing batters to chase. Dubin is out of minor league options, so the flexibility is very limited, but he has 5 years of remaining control and could be signed to a minor league deal. If the Cardinals felt they could get a higher gear out of his stuff, then it’s possible they could find one of those late-blossoming gems to the already growing group of depth.\n\n2025 – 59 G 4.48 ERA 4.13 FIP 4.48 xFIP 58 K 60.1 IP\n\nRafael Montero will give Cardinals fans Carlos Martinez vibes for sure. Coming from a smaller stature and a whip-like arm motion, it’s very tsunami-esque, so is the erratic command at times. At 14.6 BB% in 2025, that part rings true. It’s 4 pitches that all have positive traits coming out of his hand, and his splitter was a +4 in run value last season to pair with a 95+ mph heater and an above-average breaking ball as well. Montero also has closing experience, with 30 saves credited to him from 2020-2023 as a closer by committee type situation in Houston before the arrival of Josh Hader. Command will always be the biggest question mark with Montero, but for the most part, the results are there, and the Cardinals could entice him with the potential to put him in late-game high-leverage/closing situations that could inevitably lead to a mid-season trade to a contender that would return more prospects to the Cardinals’ growing pipeline.\n\nAre any of these guys true difference makers in the grand scheme of things? Probably not. But the benefit of being in the situation the Cardinals are they can take swings on upside arms like Montero, Stanek, and Perez, but also benefit from veterans like Borucki and Suter, while also having the opportunity to give guys like Dubin a real shot at a big league roster spot. When doing some research on the free agent reliever market this weekend, these were the names remaining that stuck out to me the most, and the ones I think the Cardinals could buy low on and get really good value out of. Ultimately, what the team can accomplish on the trade market will tell the tale of what roster needs will remain heading into spring training, but be certain that more changes to the roster are coming – how soon is anyone’s guess at this point.",

The Buckeyes are 8-3, but have not shot the ball particularly well lately, hitting just 26% of their three-pointers over the past five games.\n\nGrambling comes into Tuesday’s game as winners of each of their last two games, bringing their season record to 5-6. They are one of the very worst teams in the nation at taking care of the basketball, turning the ball over on 21.8% of their possessions. While they can be disruptive on the defensive end, they also struggle to take care of it themselves. This is the second meeting every between the two programs, with Ohio State having won the first game in 2015.\n\nThe Buckeyes have fallen to 16th in the Big Ten in three-point shooting at 33.7%. The last time Ohio State shot 33.7% or lower as a team from three-point range was the 2015-16 season, when OSU shot 33.4%.\n\nConnect with Connor: \nTwitter: @lemons_connor",

    "fullText": "England are once again left playing for pride and places in the last two Tests of an Ashes series down under.\n\nAustralia have an unassailable 3-0 lead following victory in Adelaide, with matches in Melbourne and Sydney to come.\n\nUsing data from analysts CricViz, here are five charts that help explain how England's latest torturous tour of Australia unravelled in just 11 days of cricket...\n\nDespite question marks over Australia's top order leading into the series, they have significantly outperformed their England counterparts - the hosts' top-three batters scoring 666 runs at an average of 41.6 compared to 436 at 24.2 by the tourists.\n\nOf course, this can mostly be attributed to Australia's masterstroke borne out of necessity when number five Travis Head was promoted to open in the second innings of the first Test in Perth because of Usman Khawaja's back spasms.\n\nHead hit one of the all-time great Ashes centuries to win the match inside two days and justified his continued promotion to opener with a sublime 170 in Adelaide.\n\nJake Weatherald, who made his debut in Perth, made a vital 72 in Brisbane amid more meagre returns, while number three Marnus Labuschagne has hit two fifties.\n\nBouncing back from a pair in Perth, England opener Zak Crawley has scored 214 runs in the past two Tests.\n\nBut fellow opener Ben Duckett is having a dismal series - 97 runs at 16.16 - while frenetic number three Ollie Pope is not faring much better and could be dropped.\n\nBooze, beach, beaten - how England lost the Ashes\n\nMentality is reason for England's losing streak in Australia - McGrath\n\nEngland have adopted an aggressive style with the bat since head coach Brendon McCullum took over in 2022 - yes, that word again, 'Bazball'.\n\nAustralia have actually scored at a higher run-rate than England so far - 4.34 v 3.78 - and played slightly more attacking shots - 34% compared to 31%.\n\nThose stats can in part be put down to match situations - for example Australia needing only 65 in their second innings in Brisbane and therefore able to attack and reach their target in 10 overs.\n\nThe key difference between the sides has been how successful they have been on the attack - Australia's average of 46.9 when playing attacking shots is far better than England's 31.4.\n\nEngland have shown more willingness to adapt since their second innings in Brisbane, but are struggling in defence too.\n\nThe tourists have lost 18 wickets while looking to defend across the series - equivalent to a dismissal every 37 defensive shots. Australia have lost seven such wickets - once in every 64 defensive shots.\n\nEngland's hyped - and hyper-fast - pace attack shone in dismissing Australia for 132 in their first innings of the first Test in Perth, but have struggled to be as effective since.\n\nIn the first 30 overs of an innings with the new ball, Australia's pace bowlers have taken 32 wickets at an average of 22.8, compared to 23 at 32.2 by England.\n\nEngland's declining threat with the new ball could be partly explained by their inability to find the correct length to bowl at on each surface since that first day in Perth.\n\nComplaints from commentators and pundits that England have frequently bowled too short are backed up by comparing the sides' accuracy on hitting a good length - defined as 5-7m from the stumps.\n\nAustralia's bowlers have landed 30% of their deliveries in this zone throughout the series, with England doing so just 23% of the time, and have therefore put the tourists' batters under more sustained pressure.\n\nEven before Marnus Labuschagne decided to have a one-man competition with himself for screamer of the series, Australia have been clearly superior in the field.\n\nThe hosts have taken 47 and dropped eight of 55 chances - a success rate of 85% compared to England's 77% (33 catches, 10 drops).\n\nHalf of England's dropped chances happened during a miserable day two of the second Test at the Gabba...\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Manchester City at the City Ground (kick-off 12:30 GMT).\n\nHere are the key lines from his news conference:\n\nOla Aina is \"progressing well\" in his recovery from a hamstring injury but is still rebuilding his fitness. He played for the B team on Monday night and came through the match \"fine and injury-free\". It is \"another step forward\" for the defender.\n\nOn the lack of intensity and urgency shown in the defeat to Fulham, Dyche said: \"You have to park these things pretty quickly. We did well overall, we weren't a million miles off. It wasn't the intensity we showed in the Tottenham game or out in Utrecht though.\"\n\nHe added: \"The game was a bit flat in general. Our fans were terrific, they were trying to get the team going, as was I. Sometimes the hardest thing is when everyone is having a bit of a down day.\"\n\nIt is \"unlikely\" that he will be weighing his players, like Pep Guardiola, before the Manchester City game. He joked: \"Is he weighing himself, do you think? One rule for one - come on, Pep!\"\n\nHe explained his philosophy around the festive period: \"I just look for my players to have a bit of common sense. I don't mind them having a Christmas dinner, why not?\" He believes \"psychology is important as anything with athletes\" and Christmas Day is \"a big part\" of life.\n\nFitness is \"very important\" but he isn't \"obsessed over weights\". He will \"encourage\" his players to \"enjoy\" the festivities, especially because they don't play until 27 December.\n\nOn opposition manager Guardiola, Dyche said: \"It is fantastic what he has achieved, there's no two ways about it. Only Sir Alex Ferguson probably tops him. He has done massive things for himself, his players and football in general.\"\n\nThe Reds will be hoping Manchester City are \"having a quiet day\" when they visit the City Ground. However, Forest will still need to play \"very well\" because they are facing a team who are \"always prepared\".\n\nDyche added: \"It's unlikely we are going to dominate the ball, so we have to be defensively sound and do all the hard yards.\"\n\nNottingham Forest's Premier League win-loss-win-loss-win-loss form \"will do\" this season, \"if it keeps going\". He explained: \"If you do the stats, if that carried on for the whole season then it would equal a pretty good situation.\"\n\nHowever, the biggest thing for Dyche is the team \"finding consistency\" - whether that be in terms of their \"training schedule or performances\" - but he recognises that will take time.\n\nHe is predicting a \"slow\" January transfer window because of the club's investment in the summer. On the other hand, he added: \"The club have shown that if players become available at the right times, they can make things happen - so you never know.\"\n\nFollow all of Tuesday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news",

    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver coach Connor Embree spoke with reporters recently about the dropped passes that plagued the team and evaluating the season of wide receiver Rashee Rice.\n\n“Mostly the drops I feel like this year have been with some stuff where it’s trying to get the ball and make a move before they catch it.” said Embree, “It’s usually with players that that’s their strength is catch the ball, get up the field – that’s first step, go, and it’s happened this year where some of those they didn’t look it all the way in before they started running.”\n\nDuring the Week 14 loss to the Houston Texans, Chiefs receivers dropped six passes, the most in a game during Patrick Mahomes’s tenure as the starting quarterback.\n\n“The suspension earlier in the season, he (Rashee Rice) was having a great training camp, preseason, and then he got suspended and had to get away for a couple of games,” said Embree, “And coming back, I thought he got off to a hot start and continued to get better throughout the year. I thought he got better, and he was trying his all to be out there with his team. Similar to Xavier (Worthy), he’s trying to take that leadership role and lead all the young guys.”\n\nRice was out with an injury in Week 16 against the Tennessee Titans and currently has collected 53 receptions for 571 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs WR Coach Connor Embree on dropped passes, Rashee Rice’s season",

    "description": "Cleveland Browns QB Shedeur Sanders has shown development but the 2026 NFL draft could bring Dante Moore, Fernando Mendoza",
    "fullText": "In sports, in general, in 2025, there is no room for nuance. We know there is here at DBN in our comment section and in The Feed, but the general sports world speaks in certainties that really don’t exist and cliché sayings (both old and new) that lack detail.\n\nDuring the Cleveland Browns’ Week 16 game against the Buffalo Bills, I was reminded of a few of those certainties and clichés. For example, many have buried QB Shedeur Sanders as having no chance of being a top-level starter in the NFL, while others have looked at the exact same performances and seen enough to know for sure the Browns should build around their fifth-round quarterback.\n\nThe cliche “if it hits your hands, you should catch it” came up after Sanders’ first interception. In my analysis, Sanders’ throw was behind and thrown too hard for RB Quinshon Judkins to be able to haul it in easily. A great receiver may have been able to make the catch, but assuming Cleveland’s running back should have caught it was too far for what I saw. For others:\n\nEh make a play.\n\nThat definitely wasn’t too hard. Definitely was too behind…but also catch the ball.\n\n— Michael Keefe (@GarageBeersMike) December 21, 2025\n\nFor what it is worth, Michael Keefe is a friend of mine who understands football and has an amazing sports voice (literal voice); we just disagree here. I’ll forever argue in the nuance, especially when most others are only arguing on the extremes and in clichés.\n\nWhich brings us back to Sanders’ future:\n\n“Shedeur deserves more time to develop with a better OL and better weapons”.’\n\nAnd \n\n“You can’t pass on Mendoza or Moore in the Top 3 if one is there”\n\nCan both be true, IMO #DawgPound\n\n— CLEology (@_CLEology) December 22, 2025\n\nYes, Clay (another sports friend of mine), both can be true.\n\nJason Lloyd of The Athletic pointed out what the raw data has told us about both Dillon Gabriel and Sanders:\n\nGabriel has a higher Expected Points Added per dropback than Sanders — although that isn’t really saying much since Gabriel and Sanders have the two lowest figures in the league this season. Sanders has thrown for more yards and is averaging more yards per attempt, but Gabriel has a higher completion percentage, a higher passer rating and a higher touchdown-to-interception ratio.\n\nThe big difference, as you turn to the film that has led to that data, is that Sanders’ play looks like a rookie quarterback who is making big mistakes, but is also growing and developing. Whether it is the deep throws to Isaiah Bond, the feathered throws to Harold Fannin Jr., the successful scrambles at key moments, or his improved (still shaky) pocket presence, Sanders has shown that he could develop into a starter in the NFL…\n\n… but the Browns are going to have a top pick in the 2026 NFL draft to select a quarterback, Dante Moore or Fernando Mendoza, that they’ll likely have a much higher prospect grade on.\n\nIf Cleveland doesn’t have a high grade on Moore, Mendoza, or another quarterback, they would look to build around Sanders, even if they trade down to hedge their bets for a QB in the 2027 NFL draft. If the Browns didn’t have a pick where they could select one of the top quarterbacks (something Sanders could still impact in the last two weeks of the season), the team would continue to develop Sanders with an improved group of players around him and veteran QB Deshaun Watson supporting him as his backup.\n\nBarring a win or two, Cleveland will be selecting at the top of the upcoming draft and, most likely, picking a quarterback.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Sanders doesn’t have a role with the Browns. As is true with all rookie quarterbacks, I’m always in the “sit them until they are ready, plus a game or two” camp of development. Sanders could have all of training camp and the start of the 2026 NFL season to prove he is a capable starter in the NFL. Auditioning for Cleveland and every other team in the NFL while Moore, Mendoza, or whoever sits and waits.\n\nEven if Sanders is the backup, the young QB will have all of camp and preseason to audition for a starting job on other teams. This season has shown (with undrafted rookies starting in multiple places) the dire need for quality quarterback play around the league. If Sanders is able to show his development, even if designated as a backup, he’ll have a chance to start for another team in the very near future, and the team would get a quality return if their fifth-round pick proves he is a starting-caliber QB.\n\nThe Browns have gone decades with just one starting-level quarterback (Baker Mayfield) on their roster. In 2026, there could be two in Cleveland if the Browns select a quarterback high in this year’s draft and Sanders continues to develop. If that happens, whoever is in charge of the front office will have a difficult decision to make. A great problem to have.\n\nShedeur Sanders has shown signs that he could develop into a starting-level quarterback, and the Cleveland Browns are likely to draft a quarterback high in the 2026 NFL draft. Both are true, and Sanders’ role with the Browns will continue in 2026.",

    "fullText": "If any Arsenal youth players hope to make a League Cup appearance against Crystal Palace on Tuesday night, it looks like it’s going to be a defensive player.\n\nDuring Monday’s first-team training session, an entire replacement back four and goalkeeper joined in with the senior players, with Jack Porter, Marli Salmon, Josh Nichols, Will Sweet, and Josh Ogunnaike all involved.\n\nArsenal fans should be aware of goalkeeper Porter, centre-back Salmon, and right-back Nichols, as all of them have previously made senior appearances under Mikel Arteta. As for the other two, Sweet is another centre-back, whilst Ogunnaike is a left-back.\n\nArsenal’s primary fitness concerns remain in defensive areas, with Cristhian Mosquera and Ben White certainly out until January and Gabriel Magalhaes also a doubt to feature in any games this month.\n\nJurrien Timber is available at right-back, but there are no natural senior alternatives in his position right now. The Palace game could be the best opportunity Arteta has to rest the Dutch defender and bring in a youth player.\n\nThen Riccardo Calafiori went down with a knock during the win over Everton, and Arteta won’t want to take risks with the Italian international given his injury history. Myles Lewis-Skelly is available to step in for Calafiori, but Ogunnaike is another alternative.\n\nIt remains unlikely that any of the above five youth players will start on Tuesday night. Though it’s a League Cup match, it’s also a quarter-final, and Arteta has shown in the past that he’s willing to take the competition seriously even if it means putting his players at risk of injuries.\n\nFor evidence of that you just have to look at last season’s match vs Newcastle United that left Gabriel Martinelli with a hamstring injury, and was also the last match Kai Havertz played before his hamstring tear in training.\n\nBefore Newcastle, Havertz had started seven of Arsenal’s previous eight games in the space of four weeks (coming off the bench in the eighth) and had played the full 90 against Manchester City three days earlier.\n\nArsenal were already 2-0 down from the first leg, and throwing the second leg by letting Martinelli and Havertz rest could have really helped the Gunners with the remainder of their campaign. But they both started anyway.\n\nTuesday night will tell us if Arsenal have learned any lessons from those setbacks.",

    "fullText": "Hello! Happy holidays and welcome to the Week 17 waiver wire watch for wide receivers!\n\nThis is the end of the line. Championship week is here for most fantasy leagues and whether you’re gunning for the title or trying to avoid the humiliation of finishing last, your fantasy season comes down to one final matchup. So its time to start looking for ways to fortify your rosters for the grand finale.\n\nWe’ll go over some performers that you should consider scooping off the waiver wire ahead of Week 17 and as always, we’ll classify a waiver add as someone who is rostered in 60% of leagues at the max. There are three games set for Christmas on Thursday and two games set for Saturday, so make sure to get your lineups situated early this week.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has been in sync with his receiver core for the past month and Washington ended up being his favorite target in the Jaguars’ 34-20 statement victory over the Broncos on Sunday. The third-year wideout was a fireworks factory at Mile High Stadium, posting a career-day by catching six of 10 targets for 145 receiving yards and a first-quarter touchdown that opened the scoring festivities for Jacksonville.\n\nHe exited Sunday as a top-three fantasy wideout in all scoring formats for the week and that’s a testament to the role that he’s played in the Jags offense in recent weeks. Momentum is on their side right now and if you need a skill guy to get you over the hump in the final week, then a Jags receiver like Washington would be a solid choice.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m. ET\n\nJohnston had his most productive game of the season on Sunday as the Chargers moved a step closer to clinching a playoff spot in their 34-17 victory over the Cowboys. The third-year wideout from TCU was hitting home runs with each catch, turning four receptions into 104 receiving yards including a first-quarter touchdown reception that put them on the board.\n\nJohnston has been relatively quiet in the second half of the season after storming out the gate with a strong start in the first month of the campaign. His big-play abilities will come in handy for the Chargers in the coming weeks and he could be a helpful hand in your championship game.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: vs. Houston Texans, 4:30 p.m. ET (Saturday afternoon)\n\nThe Broncos missed a chance to clinch the AFC West title in a 34-20 loss on Sunday and will have to wait until Christmas night at Arrowhead Stadium to get another crack at it. Franklin will most likely play a role in that matchup like he played a role in Sunday’s game, catching four of six targets for 66 receiving yards in the loss at home.\n\nFranklin has been a solid Flex pick up in deeper leagues for a while now as he’s been a top-25 fantasy wideout in four of his last six outings. He continue to flex his rapport with his college teammate Bo Nix and he may get a chance to bury a Chiefs team that has nothing to play for.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Kansas City Chiefs, 8:15 p.m. ET (Thursday night)\n\nThe Lions’ playoff hopes are on life support as their 29-24 loss to the Steelers on Sunday eliminated them from NFC North title contention and left them with the faintest of hope to grab the final Wild Card spot in the NFC. Seven different players caught at least three passes for the Lions in this one and Raymond made his mark with four catches for 62 receiving yards and a touchdown.\n\nWith their backs against the wall, Dan Campbell may throw everything and the kitchen sink at the Vikings on Christmas. Expect to see a bunch of different pass-catchers get utilized on Thursday and we may see another strong effort out of Raymond.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Minnesota Vikings, 4:30 p.m. ET (Thursday afternoon)",

    "fullText": "Villarreal have perhaps been the most active side in the transfer market in Spain over the last few years, and already the Yellow Submarine are on the move for the winter window. They will strengthen their midfield with the addition of a young Argentine promise.\n\nThat promise goes by the name of Thiago Fernandez. The 21-year-old Buenos Aires native is set to leave Velez Sarsfield, the club he came through at, next week when his contract expires. Diario AS detail that Fernandez had already decided not to renew his deal with Velez, and seek a move elsewhere.\n\nThey say that Villarreal have already wrapped up his signing on a free transfer, and he will join up with the rest of the squad after the Christmas break, at the turn of the year. The rumoured contract for Fernandez will be valid for 5.5 years until 2031. He is expected to alternate between the first team and Villarreal B to get him up to speed.\n\nFernandez has operated primarily as a left winger or an attacking midfielder so far in his career. It is a relatively green career in terms of his senior contributions, with just 48 appearances for Velez in his career, which featured six goals and nine assists.\n\nInjury has kept him out of action for the entirety of 2025, hence Villarreal will be keen to give him time to get back up to full throttle. Last year, in 2024, he had his breakout season, managing five goals and six assists in his 25 league appearances.\n\nIn all likelihood, Marcelino Garcia Toral will not be counting on a big impact from the 21-year-old, as his side pursues a Champions League finish. Their fine La Liga campaign has contrasted with their fortunes in the Copa del Rey and Champions League, meaning Marcelino will have less cause to rotate in the second half of the season.",

    "description": "With Toyota Hypercar seats among the hardest to access in the WEC, Masson is quietly building a case as one of the marque’s most promising endurance prospects",
    "fullText": "Toyota has no shortage of junior drivers within its roster, both in Japan and overseas, but one young protege has begun to stand out: Esteban Masson.\n\nThe Canadian-born Frenchman has just completed his first season under Toyota’s TGR Driver Challenge Program, and his early progress suggests a promising future in endurance racing.\n\nLike many drivers, Masson started his career in single-seaters, winning the French F4 title in his first full year in formula cars. A step up to the fiercely-competitive Formula Regional European Championship followed in 2022, but results proved harder to come by across two seasons, despite flashes of speed.\n\nBut there was clearly a lot of underlying potential in Masson, as highlighted by his championship-winning campaign in Eurocup, a new championship launched as an alternative to FRECA and Euroformula Open.\n\nSwitching to sportscar racing in 2024 allowed him to realise that untapped potential, and proved to be a turning point in his career. Masson finished second in the European Le Mans Series’ GT class aboard a Kessel Racing Ferrari, while also contesting a parallel programme in the World Endurance Championship with ASP as the silver-graded driver in the #87 Lexus RC F GT3.\n\nAlthough the Lexus struggled for competitiveness in LMGT3’s inaugural season, the campaign allowed him to forge closer ties with Toyota and earn a test of the GR010 Hybrid at Bahrain.\n\nFor 2025, Masson was formally integrated into Toyota’s young driver scheme and embarked on another dual programme, contesting ELMS in the top LMP2 class alongside Japan’s Super Formula Lights championship.\n\nOnce again, he emerged as one of the star performers in the European championship, winning the overall title with Oliver Gray and Alpine Hypercar driver Charles Milesi with CDS Panis Racing. The trio also came agonisingly close to victory at the Le Mans 24 Hours, only for a late technical issue to deny them in the closing stages.\n\nWith the 2025 season now complete, Masson is preparing for his return to the WEC, having been named in ASP’s LMGT3 line-up for 2026, this time as the designated pro driver in the #78 Lexus.\n\nIt’s a responsibility he seems ready for, having substituted for factory driver Ben Barnicoat at Imola this year, where he helped deliver a podium finish. ASP has also managed to turn the RC F GT3 into a race winner, putting Masson in a much stronger position than he was in his rookie season.\n\nFew people are better placed to judge that progression than ASP team boss Jerome Policand, who has followed Masson closely over the years and has a keen eye for young talent. Policand described the 21-year-old as “something special” and believes he is ripe for a move up to the Hypercar class.\n\n“I'm quite proud of this because the first time he had a test in GT3, it was with us. I presented him to Toyota,” Policand told Motorsport.com. “I know Esteban since he was racing go-karts. He was successful in Formula 4 and FRECA.\n\n“I know he has the potential. That's the reason I asked [TGR vice-chairman] Kazuki [Nakajima] to test him, and then we were aligned that he has the potential. We tried to put a budget together to run him.\n\n“For me, he has the skill to be in the big category now. We'll see in the future. It's always good for a team.\n\n“We did the same with Jules Gounon [and] Raffaele Maricello; when he stopped in Formula 2, his first team was us, with Mercedes [when ASP was a Mercedes customer].\n\n“We got used to trying to find drivers with high potential but a bit of bad luck. You put them with the right tools, and they become professional drivers.\n\n“But for sure, for me, Esteban has something special.”\n\nBreaking into Toyota’s factory line-up is an incredibly difficult challenge. The last addition to the Japanese marque’s Hypercar team was Nyck de Vries, who joined the #7 crew in 2024 after a long stint as its reserve driver and accumulating plenty of test miles in the GR010 LMH.\n\nPrior to de Vries’s signing, the last time Toyota made a change to its line-up was in 2022, when Ryo Hirakawa stepped up from Super GT to replace the retiring Nakajima.\n\nPolicand is aware that landing a plum Toyota seat won’t be easy, but believes Masson has what it takes to join the most successful team in present-day WEC.\n\n“I think he has the potential,” he said. “You know how it is. I don't say WEC is like Formula 1, but to reach [there, it is difficult] because the level of the driver in WEC is incredible - especially at Toyota.\n\n“If you look at the two line-ups, they are super strong. But he has a chance, yes.”\n\nToyota knows that it has landed an exceptional talent with Masson. The 2026 WEC season will be crucial for him, as he helms the #78 ASP crew in a car now capable of winning races and potentially mounting a title assault. How he fares in 2026 could go a long way in shaping his long-term future and determining whether he is ripe for a Hypercar promotion.\n\nToyota’s driver line-up for 2026 is already set, but Nakajima suggested that Masson is very much on the radar as the team evaluates its long-term plans.\n\n“Esteban is basically part of our driver development,” the 40-year-old told Motorsport.com. “He's been racing in ELMS and this year he has done Super Formula Lights, and he did some LMGT3 as well. He is performing really well and he is progressing quite well.\n\n“We have to say we are lucky that we have such a driver in our young driver programme.\n\n“Generally, we are always open to find any possible new talent. Particularly within the Toyota family, we have a high motivation to give any possible opportunity that we can give to those young drivers, as well to also find the talent. This is important as a team to look ahead for the long term.\n\n“At the same time, we are also happy with our current drivers, so it's just a matter of how long [it takes before we need to change our line-up] - but we need to be prepared as a team. I'm quite happy with what we have in our hands right now.”\n\nV8-powered Toyota GR GT3 launched to replace Lexus RC F GT3\n\nPeugeot leaning towards upgrades, rather than all-new car, in WEC\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The NFL has suspended Pittsburgh Steelers WR DK Metcalf two games for getting physical with a Detroit Lions fan in Week 16, leaving the Steel City brand of football without its top wideout to close the season.\n\nFrom a healthy inactive finally getting a chance to see the field to more receiving opportunities for a dual-threat running back, here are some of the biggest Steelers’ takeaways following Metcalf’s suspension.\n\nA healthy scratch in the past three games for Pittsburgh, Wilson should return to the fold in Metcalf’s absence. The second-year Steelers wideout has two regular-season games to prove himself as a top receiver in the Aaron Rodgers-led offense, and he should rise to the occasion.\n\nWith Metcalf set to miss the next two games and Calvin Austin III potentially sidelined with a hamstring injury, veteran wide receivers Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling might get the starting opportunity to close out the season.\n\nIn the wake of Metcalf’s suspension, Pittsburgh’s top receiver isn’t a wideout — it’s running back Kenneth Gainwell, who already leads the offense in receptions. Expect to see a bigger dose of Gainwell moving forward as the Steelers gear up for the final two games of the season.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers' takeaways following DK Metcalf suspension",

    "fullText": "There was some big news for Notre Dame on Monday afternoon, its rivalry with USC will pause for at least 5 years.\n\nThe two teams were originally scheduled to play next year, but that was an option game that the Trojans had ducked out of already. It wasn’t official until yesterday, but many had seen the writing on the wall, the battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh will be on a break.\n\nIt didn’t take long for social media to react on both sides, many of them putting the blame on USC for not wanting to continue the storied series. You can find below some of the best reactions from social media on both sides of the rivalry.\n\nLincoln Riley in July 2024, via @Matt_Fortuna. He wanted out of the ND game then, their actions have since pointed to that, and then they blew up negotiations at the last minute.

There were plenty of signs.\n\n— Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) December 22, 2025\n\nBefore the USC news came out, the Irish announced a home-and-home with BYU, jumping the cycle. Notre Dame’s administration knew this day was coming and had a plan, a very good plan.\n\nTruth bomb from 1 of the greatest players to come out of the beautiful South Bay in Southern California. @Theoldp #FightOn ✌️#GoIrish ☘️pic.twitter.com/VGIti8Vq6d\n\n— Timmy Hyde (@CoachTimmyHyde) December 23, 2025\n\nPedro’s Papadakis, a host at LA Sports 570 AM, went off on Riley, as he doesn’t understand the history at USC. He said “this is a dark mark on the university for the lack of leaders … it’s a shameful day in the history of college football.”\n\nThis is ridiculous! Just say we scared. I’ll accept that at least it’s the truth. 🤦🏾‍♂️ #USC #Trojans #NotreDame pic.twitter.com/B11S2sqcEX\n\n— Keyshawn Johnson (@keyshawn) December 22, 2025\n\nThe former All-American wondered what was going on inside the athletic department along with more bashing of Riley not understanding the programs history. Johnson said “why would we cancel our biggest rivalry because we can’t beat them? It makes zero sense.” Strong words from a former star Trojan.\n\nUSC under Lincoln Riley is maybe the most pillow soft USC has ever been, it’s honestly embarrassing to see the rationalizations from Trojan land on this. https://t.co/8GD2aB8Wd7\n\n— David Woods (@daviddavidwoods) December 22, 2025\n\nIt’s hard to see why ducking a historic rival is a good idea. The Trojan faithful can argue all they want about why it makes sense, but they know deep down, it really doesn’t.\n\nIt wasn’t fair for the players. But CFB was better when:\n\nThere were regional conference\nTransferring meant you sit out a year\nNo NIL\n\nIt just was.

You have to wonder how much pull the former players have to try and get this game back on the schedule.\n\nWait, why doesn’t USC simply not lose? https://t.co/p2fqz3f322 pic.twitter.com/CdaBA40fsk\n\n— RedditCFB (@RedditCFB) December 22, 2025\n\nThe Trojans have had some recent chances to make the playoff, only to falter late.

    "description": "AJ Barner, Brenton Strange highlight the top waiver wire wide receiver targets entering Week 17.",
    "fullText": "Hello! Happy holidays and welcome to the Week 17 waiver wire watch for tight ends!\n\nThis is the end of the line. Championship week is here for most fantasy leagues and whether you’re gunning for the title or trying to avoid the humiliation of finishing last, your fantasy season comes down to one final matchup. So its time to start looking for ways to fortify your rosters for the grand finale.\n\nWe’ll go over some performers that you should consider scooping off the waiver wire ahead of Week 17 and as always, we’ll classify a waiver add as someone who is rostered in 60% of leagues at the max. There are three games set for Christmas on Thursday and two games set for Saturday, so make sure to get your lineups situated early this week.\n\nMany playmakers played a hand in the Seahawks’ frantic 38-37 overtime victory over the Rams on Thursday and chief among them was Barner. He maneuvered his way around the Rams defense and got open for a 26-yard fourth-quarter touchdown that ended up tying the game for Seattle. He ended his night with a respectable line of four receptions for 49 receiving yards and the aforementioned score.\n\nThis marked the first time the second-year Michigan product had found the end zone since his two-touchdown day against the Buccaneers way back in Week 5. They’re going up against a Panthers team that has given up the 10th-most receiving yards to opposing tight ends this year, so there’s a chance for him to have a repeat performance from last Thursday.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Carolina Panthers, 1 p.m. ET\n\nSix straight wins for the Jaguars makes for a team that is hitting their stride just in time for the playoffs and they’re getting quality performances from multiple playmakers on offense. Strange is in that camp and he came away with five catches for 39 receiving yards and a second-quarter touchdown in their 34-20 victory over the Broncos on Sunday.\n\nTrevor Lawrence has spread the wealth around his offense and Strange has popped up as a beneficiary from time to time, recently posting a 93-yard performance against the Cardinals in Week 11. If you’re in your championship game and need a waiver option that will give you a shot in the arm, then you’d want to seek out Jags playmakers like Strange.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m. ET\n\nThe Chiefs’ season is effectively over and the Titans took advantage of the state of the fallen AFC power with a 29-9 victory on Sunday. It was the best game of the season for Cam Ward and one of the guys that he leaned on was Okonkwo, who caught six of eight targets for 44 receiving yards and a touchdown.\n\nOkonkwo continues to lead the Titans in receiving and he entered Week 16 with the third-highest catch rate among starting tight ends at 76.3%. He’s bound to keep getting fed targets in these final weeks, so keep him in mind.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: vs. New Orleans Saints, 1 p.m. ET\n\nDon’t look now, but the Saints have rattled off three straight victories and may be creating some momentum heading into the offseason. Their 29-6 burial of the Jets on Sunday saw a strong effort from Johnson, who was a reliable hand for Tyler Shough throughout the afternoon by catching eight of nine targets for 89 receiving yards in the big win.\n\nJohnson has quietly been a top-10 fantasy tight end in all scoring formats all season long and has been the second-leading receiving option for the Saints this year. If tight end is what you’re lacking for your championship showdown, why not lean towards the veteran.\n\nWeek 17 matchup: @ Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m. ET",

Celebrities, friends, and basketball fans around the world mourned their unfortunate death.\n\nInterestingly, following Bryant and his daughter’s demise, various media outlets reported a surge in the names “Kobe” and “Gianna” as popular baby names.

In 2020, 1,500 families named their newborn Kobe, representing 0.082 percent of the total male births. Also, 55 girls were named Kobe, including basketball player Kevin Pillar (via PEOPLE and Newsweek).\n\nHowever, there is no concrete evidence that LA hospitals have banned the name Kobe starting in 2026. As of writing, the Hoops Crave post has garnered 47K likes, 1.2K comments, 1.7K retweets, and 3.2K saves.\n\nOne fan commented, “I love Kob, but this doesn’t make any sense, tbh.

    "fullText": "Fabio Capello believes that it is a genuine five-horse race for the Serie A title this season, but believes that all of Juventus, Inter, Milan, Napoli and Roma have room for improvement if they are to claim the 2025-26 Scudetto.\n\nThe former Milan, Roma, Juventus and England head coach analysed all five team’s chances of winning the Serie A title in an in-depth interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\nFour points separates five teams at the top of the Serie A standings heading into the Christmas period. It’s an entertaining and satisfying table for the neutral, with Inter on 33 points, Milan on 32, Napoli on 31, Roma on 30 and Juventus on 29.\n\nAsked by La Gazzetta dello Sport whether this five-way race for the Serie A title could go the full distance, Capello said: “Why not? I don’t see anyone breaking away at the moment. They all score points, they all occasionally slow down. Milan and Roma were in the lead, now Inter and Napoli are back up there, Juve are seriously getting back into the frame.”\n\nDoes he see Juventus as worthy title challengers this season?\n\n“Their season certainly isn’t over. They’ve got a run of forms that could bring them 12 points in their next few games,” he said.\n\nBOLOGNA, ITALY – DECEMBER 14: Juan Cabal of Juventus celebrates scoring his team’s first goal during the Serie A match between Bologna FC 1909 and Juventus FC at Renato Dall’Ara Stadium on December 14, 2025 in Bologna, Italy. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\nAnd on Spalletti, Capello said: “He’s found the right players to play in many positions. He’s rediscovered that determination and aggressiveness that had disappeared. And Juve are one of the few Italian sides who can take players on and create a numerical superiority: Yildiz, Conceicao, Zhegrova, they often put rivals in trouble.”\n\nDoes he feel that Juventus are genuine Scudetto contenders this season?\n\n“Juve are there, they could make up the gap, and they still have direct clashes left to play,” he answered.\n\nOn Inter, Capello says: “Chivu has played it safe so far. I think he’s evaluated the (suboptimal) condition of several players and has therefore decided to hold off with any experiments. He’s in the lead though.”\n\nRIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA – DECEMBER 19: Marcus Thuram of Internazionale celebrates scoring his team’s first goal with teammates during the Supercoppa Italiana semifinal match between Bologna FC 1909 and FC Internazionale at King Saud University Stadium on December 19, 2025 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. (Photo by Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)\n\nAnd on Milan, he added: “Milan drop points and concede goals, that’s not like Allegri. This is Milan’s downfall: They have to find defensive solidity. Mistakes have cost them far too many points. Their attitude is very attacking, but they do find trouble at the back.”\n\nMilan are in the process of signing Niclas Fullkrug from West Ham to plug a gap in attack, but does Capello feel that he is a wise signing in January?\n\nLONDON, ENGLAND – AUGUST 22: Niclas Fullkrug of West Ham United applauds the fans as he warms up prior to the Premier League match between West Ham United and Chelsea at London Stadium on August 22, 2025 in London, England. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images)\n\n“It’s a great question. It’s definitely difficult to play without a no.9. Fullkrug is an old-fashioned striker, the club must have had a discussion over who the right fit would be. But it’s not just a question of centre-forwards: They’re not playing in Europe and they need to take advantage of that.”\n\nCapello agrees with many supporters that Roma need more attacking options before they can be considered serious title contenders this season: “Without a centre-forward, Gasperini has also had a lot of problems,” he said.\n\n“It’s difficult. Against Juventus, there was no reference point up front. Roma played better in the first half, but they made a mistake in insisting on playing through the middle when Juve had just brought Bremer back in.”\n\nROME, ITALY – NOVEMBER 27: AS Roma head coach Gian Piero Gasperini looks on during the UEFA Europa League 2025/26 League Phase MD5 match between AS Roma and FC Midtjylland at Stadio Olimpico on November 27, 2025 in Rome, Italy. (Photo by Paolo Bruno/Getty Images)\n\nAnd on the attackers that Roma have been linked with so far this winter, Capello said: “I like Zirkzee a lot, he knows how to play with his back to goal and moves well. Raspadori on the other hand, is more of a second striker. He fits in well, he has a sense for goals, but he’s not a centre-forward.”\n\nAnd lastly, on Napoli, fresh off a Supercoppa Italiana victory in Saudi Arabia on Monday night, Capello said: “Napoli have excellent players and a winning coach in Conte.\n\nRIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA – DECEMBER 22: Antonio Conte, Head Coach of SSC Napoli, reacts during the trophy ceremony after the team’s victory in the Supercoppa Italiana Final between SSC Napoli and Bologna FC 1909 at King Saud University Stadium on December 22, 2025 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. (Photo by Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)\n\n“Now Lukaku and some of the other injured players are back, and the success in the Supercoppa will be massive for the players’ mindset. It’s a psychological turning point that could also relaunch them in the league.”",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid’s long-term defensive planning has suffered a significant setback, with fresh developments emerging around one of their most closely followed targets.\n\nAccording to journalist Santi Aouna, Dayot Upamecano and Bayern Munich are now very close to finalising a contract extension, having already agreed on almost every major aspect of the deal.\n\nFor months, Upamecano’s contractual situation has been carefully monitored by Real Madrid.\n\nThe French centre-back was identified as a prime target for the summer of 2026, largely due to the uncertainty surrounding his future in Munich and the belief that Madrid could exploit a favourable market opportunity.\n\nInternally, Los Blancos had placed him at the top of their defensive shortlist and were even confident enough to believe that a verbal understanding had been reached.\n\nHowever, Bayern have refused to let the situation slip away. While negotiations between the German club and the player were not always smooth, the Bavarians remained convinced they could convince their defender to stay.\n\nThat persistence now appears to be paying off.\n\nDayot Upamecano will renew his contract with Bayern Munich. (Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to the report, Bayern and Upamecano have already reached an agreement on all financial terms of the new contract and the only unresolved detail concerns the timing of a release clause.\n\nBayern want the clause to come into effect from next summer, ensuring they retain control over the player in the short term.\n\nUpamecano, on the other hand, is pushing for the clause to be valid as early as the summer of 2026, giving him greater freedom over his future.\n\nThis detail is crucial because interest remains strong. Both Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are prepared to meet the player’s expectations should the door open.\n\nMadrid, in particular, had hoped to position themselves perfectly ahead of 2026, taking advantage of any contractual leverage.\n\nThe latest progress made by Bayern significantly complicates that plan. With most issues resolved, the German club are now firmly back in control of the situation. While nothing is signed yet, the balance has shifted clearly in their favour.",

    "description": "Isak suffered a leg break against Tottenham following a Micky van de Ven horror tackle.",
    "fullText": "Over the weekend, news emerged that Liverpool striker Alexander Isak had likely suffered a broken leg that would see the Sweden international and record signing out for a period of months, likely missing much of the second half of the season as a result.\n\nToday at his press conference for Saturday’s Premier League game against Wolves, manager Arne Slot confirmed that Isak will indeed be out for months rather than days or weeks. On the positive side, though, it’s a timeline that means he could play again this season.\n\n“It’s going to be a long injury,” Slot said. “For a couple of months. It’s a big, big disappointment for him and of course also for us. It’s been a really difficult period for him, I think. You join a new club and you want to show immediately all the qualities you have.\n\n“But that was impossible. If you haven’t trained for three or four months on a serious level with a team and you’re playing in this league—in this league you need to be on the top of your game. So that took, which we all knew, months because there was no pre-season.\n\n“We had hardly time to train so we always knew it would take time and that’s why he is so unlucky that he is now injured because I think we all saw with his goal against West Ham, with this goal Saturday, that he got closer and closer to the player he was at Newcastle.”\n\nAn expected two to three month layoff—and it’s likely to be towards the longer end before Isak is fit to train with teammates—could see Isak perhaps seeing the pitch again towards the end of March. At that point, though, he will be far short of being match fit and sharp.",

    "fullText": "The weight-loss drug Wegovy is coming in pill form — and it's much cheaper than the shots.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has approved a once-daily oral version of Wegovy, giving patients a needle-free alternative to the weekly injection, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said on Monday.\n\nThe approval makes Wegovy the first pill-based GLP-1 drug cleared specifically for weight management. It contains semaglutide, the same active ingredient used in the injection, the company said.\n\nNovo Nordisk said it expects to launch the pill in the US in early January. A 1.5 milligram starting dose will be available through pharmacies and select telehealth providers for $149 per month.\n\nThat price is lower than the list price for injectable Wegovy, which costs about $1,350 a month before insurance or discounts. Novo Nordisk said it will share more details on coverage and savings options for higher doses and eligible patients closer to launch.\n\n\"With today's approval of the Wegovy pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy injection,\" said Mike Doustdar, the CEO of Novo Nordisk.\n\nThe pill is approved for adults with obesity or those who are overweight with \"at least one weight-related health condition.\" It is also approved to help reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes, in certain patients, the company said.\n\nIn a late-stage clinical trial, over 300 patients taking the pill lost an average of 16.6% of their body weight over about 64 weeks when they stayed on treatment. Novo Nordisk said the result is comparable to the weight loss seen with the injectable version of Wegovy.\n\nSide effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were similar to those reported with injections, the company added.\n\nDemand for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs has surged in recent years despite the high cost.\n\nHealth policy research group KFF surveyed more than 1,300 adult Americans online and by phone in late October and early November, and found that about one in eight — or 12% — said they are taking a GLP-1 drug like Wegovy or Ozempic either to lose weight or to treat diabetes or another chronic condition. That's up by about six percentage points from 18 months ago, KFF said.\n\nThe survey also found that many users struggle with cost: About half of the people taking a GLP-1 drug said it was difficult to afford, even with insurance.",

    "fullText": "Gold's blistering rally this year hasn't stayed confined to commodities markets.\n\nOne of the biggest and most unexpected beneficiaries has been the Thai baht, which has emerged as one of the region's breakout currencies even as Thailand's domestic economy continues to struggle.\n\nThe Thai baht has surged 10% against the dollar this year to its strongest level since June 2021 on the back of gold's record-breaking streak.\n\nSpot gold is trading around $4,485 per troy ounce, up about 70% so far this year, driven by a powerful mix of central bank demand, geopolitical uncertainty, and Fed monetary easing.\n\nOn Monday, the spot gold price extended its record-breaking streak this year, hitting a record high of 4,497.55 per ounce, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe baht's rally looks puzzling when viewed through a domestic lens. Thailand's benchmark SET stock index is about 9% lower year-to-date, reflecting economic challenges.\n\n\"With woefully weak tourism, and fragile household confidence offsetting wider exports boost amidst the border clash with Cambodia, THB's surge is mainly derived from its exceptional (positive) correlation with Gold's glitter rather than economic shine proper,\" wrote Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's Asia macro research head, excluding Japan, on Tuesday.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, those challenges would weigh on the currency. This year, gold has overwhelmed them.\n\nThe yellow metal is a traditional store of wealth for Thais, with the country ranking among Asia's top consumers after China and India.\n\nThat dominance is boosting the baht because Thailand is an active gold trading market.\n\nAs dollar-denominated international gold prices surge, related capital flows such as export receipts tend to lift demand for the baht after currency conversion.\n\nAs dollar-denominated gold prices surged this year, Thailand's gold exports jumped 52% to $11.6 billion from January through October.\n\nThe baht's strength has stoked concerns among policymakers.\n\nLast week, Thai Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas said the baht was too strong and was hurting the country's export-reliant economy.\n\nVital Ratanakorn, Thailand's central bank governor, said the country's gold trade should be regulated.\n\nThailand's finance ministry announced on Tuesday that its central bank, finance ministry, and securities regulator would hold a briefing about the baht later in the day.",

    "description": "It's one of the first times that Ukrainian troops have said they used a ground drone to replace humans in holding the line for an extended period.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian army corps said on Monday that its troops used a remote-controlled vehicle mounted with a machine gun to hold frontline positions for 45 straight days.\n\n\"For 1.5 months, the ground drone of the Third Assault Brigade held the position instead of the infantry!\" said the Ukrainian 3rd Army Corps in a statement on Telegram.\n\nThe platform in question is an uncrewed ground vehicle, or UGV, called the Droid TW 12.7, which is equipped with a .50-caliber machine gun.\n\nIt marks one of the first times that Ukrainian troops have said they've used a UGV to replace or assist humans in holding front-line positions — one of the war's most perilous tasks — for an extended period.\n\nThe corps published aerial footage of the drone firing its weapon in fields, as well as a short clip, filmed from the drone's mounted camera, of it engaging an unknown target.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the location or date of filming for this footage.\n\nThe corps said the ground drone was deployed for 45 days to suppress Russian advances on the frontline with machine-gun fire, and that it was controlled by operators from a safe location.\n\n\"During the mission, the enemy failed to infiltrate or occupy our position. And the fighters held the lines with zero casualties,\" the corps said.\n\nThe unit that operated the Droid TW 12.7 belonged to NC13, a company within the 3rd Assault Brigade that was launched in September and specifically focuses on UGV warfare.\n\nThe Droid TW 12.7 is a remotely operated tracked system equipped with an M2 Browning, developed by the Ukrainian defense technology company DevDroid.\n\nDevDroid says that the ground drone has an operational range of up to 15 miles and is controlled via a radio signal, while also featuring automated navigation powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nIt recently drew attention for being deployed in an ambush against a Russian infantry fighting vehicle, where footage filmed from its camera showed the drone pivoting quickly to continue firing on its target.\n\nThe achievement announced by the 3rd Army Corps is another sign of the growing use of UGVs in the war. Both Ukrainian and Russian troops have been developing such ground drones to fill dangerous tasks, from minesweeping to ferrying supplies near the front lines.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian companies and units have also been increasingly experimenting with UGVs that can perform combat missions.\n\nWhile these still require human pilots, they mark the early stages of robotic systems being used in place of human infantry to fight on the ground.",

    "description": "Yoshua Bengio, one of the \"AI godfathers,\" said AI technology has a sycophancy problem, so he lies to chatbots to get better responses.",
    "fullText": "Want to make your chatbot more honest with you? Try lying to it.\n\nIn an episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" that aired on December 18, research scientist Yoshua Bengio told the podcast's host, Steven Bartlett, that he realized AI chatbots were useless at providing feedback on his research ideas because they always said positive things.\n\n\"I wanted honest advice, honest feedback. But because it is sycophantic, it's going to lie,\" he said.\n\nBengio said he switched strategies, deciding to lie to the chatbot by presenting his idea as a colleague's, which produced more honest responses from the technology.\n\n\"If it knows it's me, it wants to please me,\" he said.\n\nBengio, a professor in the computer science and operations research department at the Université de Montréal, is known as one of the \"AI godfathers, alongside researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun. In June, he announced the launch of an AI safety research nonprofit, LawZero, which he said aims to reduce dangerous behaviors associated with frontier AI models, such as lying and cheating.\n\n\"This syconphancy is a real example of misalignment. We don't actually want these AIs to be like this,\" he said on \"The Diary of a CEO.\" He also said that receiving positive feedback from AI could cause users to become emotionally attached to the technology, creating further problems.\n\nOther tech industry experts have also been sounding the alarm on AI being too much of a \"yes man.\"\n\nIn September 2025, Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos reported that researchers at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Oxford put confession posts from a Reddit page into chatbots to see how the technology would assess the behaviour the posters had admitted to. They found that 42% of the time, AI gave the \"wrong\" answer, saying the person behind the post hadn't behaved poorly, even though humans judging the posts had disagreed, Notopoulos wrote.\n\nAI companies have been outspoken about trying to reduce sycophancy in their models. Earlier this year, OpenAI removed an update to ChatGPT that it said caused the bot to provide \"overly supportive but disingenuous\" responses.",

    "description": "A Pentagon watchdog says the Army and Navy misrepresented recruit test scores, exceeding federal limits on low scorers.",
    "fullText": "A new Pentagon Inspector General report says that the Army and Navy misrepresented the academic qualifications of some recruits, allowing both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring enlistees.\n\nThe report, released earlier this month, is based on a yearlong review of the services' Future Soldier and Future Sailor preparatory courses, which are new \"pre-boot camps\" created in recent years.\n\nThe programs have helped the Army and Navy enlist more recruits amid a national recruiting crisis by taking applicants with low entrance exam scores or fitness shortfalls and aiming to prepare them for service — addressing the deficiencies — in a matter of weeks or months.\n\nThe Defense Department Inspector General found that the Army and Navy miscalculated the number of low-scoring recruits they enlisted by counting test scores earned after applicants completed the preparatory courses, rather than the scores they received before entering those programs.\n\nThat approach allowed both services to exceed federal limits on low-scoring recruits without notifying the Secretary of Defense, as required by the rule. The secretary has the authority to raise those limits, but must also inform Congress.\n\nThe Pentagon disputed the report's findings, arguing that the scores that should count are those earned at the end of the preparatory courses, not those taken beforehand.\n\n\"Improving a recruit's academic skills is a primary reason for creating the [Future Soldier and Future Sailor Preparatory Courses],\" William Fitzhugh, the acting assistant secretary of defense for manpower and reserve affairs, wrote in a memo to the inspector general. \"Improved academic skills, and the resulting AFQT scores, enable such recruits to pursue a broader range of occupations, which benefits them and the Military Services.\"\n\nFederal law caps the number of recruits who score low on the Armed Forces Qualification Test, known as Category IV applicants, at 4% of the total number of recruits who ship to boot camp each year. Category IV applicants score between the 10th and 30th percentiles on the exam, which assesses subjects such as reading comprehension, math, and mechanics.\n\nSuch recruits \"tend to exhibit below average trainability and on-the-job performance,\" the report said.\n\nThe cap is intended to ensure the services attract enough high-scoring recruits to fill technically demanding roles, such as cyber operations, intelligence, and special operations, as well as many logistics and administrative jobs that also require strong academic performance.\n\nHad the services used applicants' original test scores, the Navy would have classified more than 11% of its 2025 enlistments as Category IV recruits, compared with just over 7% when counting scores earned after the preparatory course. The Army also exceeded 10% of Category IV recruits, though the report did not say by how much.\n\nThe findings come as the Army and Navy begin to emerge from a yearslong recruiting crisis that left both services thousands of recruits short in recent years. Nearly three-quarters of American youth do not meet either the military's fitness or its academic requirements to qualify for service, and fewer than ever are likely to consider military careers, making innovative recruiting efforts critical.\n\nA previous inspector general report raised concerns about \"less restrictive testing standards\" in the Army's preparatory course and found that some participants struggled with English as a second language. The Pentagon also disputed those findings.",

    "title": "'Fragmented' Microsoft tools undercut efficiency at Amazon and Whole Foods, internal Deloitte review found",
    "description": "Whole Foods' use of Microsoft 365 apps remained disconnected from Amazon, leading to inefficiencies and security concerns, a Deloitte review found.",
    "fullText": "It's been more than eight years since Amazon bought Whole Foods, but the two companies still haven't aligned their setup for the Microsoft software their employees use.\n\nThat disconnect was flagged in an 8-week Deloitte review of Whole Foods' use of Microsoft 365 apps earlier this year, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.\n\nDeloitte found that Whole Foods relies on \"fragmented\" Microsoft toolsets, has loose security and data-retention practices, and employs a complex user-management setup — all of which contribute to inefficiencies and lower productivity when working with Amazon employees.\n\nThe consulting firm recommended a 24-month integration plan that would first move Whole Foods' corporate employees onto Amazon's backend system, followed by its frontline workers. The phased approach would ensure a \"smooth transition for users and minimal disruption to business processes,\" while generating cost savings, the document said.\n\nThe review, completed in May, highlights Amazon's ongoing challenges in integrating Whole Foods. Since acquiring the chain in 2017, the company has struggled to scale the business and integrate operations, resulting in frequent reorganizations and shifting strategic priorities.\n\nNow, under new grocery chief Jason Buechel, Amazon is making a renewed push to knit Whole Foods more closely with its Amazon Fresh division. Buechel, who is both Whole Foods' CEO and Amazon's VP of grocery, has been championing a unified \"One Grocery\" strategy and a \"flying formation\" model aimed at bringing the two organizations into tighter alignment.\n\nIt also underscores Amazon's dependence on cloud rival Microsoft for core productivity software such as word processing and spreadsheets. In 2023, Amazon committed to spending at least $1 billion over five years on Microsoft 365, Business Insider previously reported. The company has long struggled to develop its own business applications and, earlier this year, formally adopted Zoom in place of its Chime meeting app.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson, Jamie Forrest, told Business Insider that Amazon has a \"successful and growing\" grocery business with more than 150 million customers. Over the years, the company has made changes to \"simplify ways of working and better collaborate across teams,\" Forrest added.\n\n\"We're bringing our corporate grocery teams closer together with a consistent employee experience, including aligning to the same technology systems and tools, to make it easier to collaborate and innovate on behalf of our customers,\" Forrest said in a statement.\n\nThe Deloitte team collaborated with Whole Foods employees to evaluate the current landscape and develop a future roadmap for the company's use of Microsoft 365.\n\nUltimately, Deloitte identified six \"key themes\" that must be addressed to streamline the business, including:\n\nDeloitte recommended a phased integration plan that first migrates Whole Foods' corporate staff to Amazon's backend technology, followed by frontline workers.\n\nUnder the plan, corporate workers would transition early to Amazon's tenant for email and OneDrive, while more complex systems, such as SharePoint and Teams, would shift gradually to allow for testing and re-permissioning involving both Whole Foods and Amazon identities. All workloads would eventually be consolidated under Amazon, enabling Whole Foods to cut duplicative licensing costs and align with Amazon's security standards.\n\n\"As applications and services transition, they will seamlessly integrate under a unified tenant, fostering streamlined interactions between WFM and Amazon employees,\" the document stated. \"Aligning with Amazon's security protocols and guidelines will significantly enhance WFM's organizational security posture, ensuring adherence to superior industry standards.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Amazon and Whole Foods adopted the full set of recommendations. But the gradual shift that Deloitte recommended mirrors Amazon's broader workforce consolidation effort with Whole Foods.\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, Amazon began moving Whole Foods' corporate employees onto its own systems earlier this year. Now, under an internal project codenamed \"Cremini,\" Amazon plans to absorb the entire 100,000-plus workforce of Whole Foods, including frontline employees.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and Grindr are investing in AI-powered matchmaking, hoping to fend off swiping fatigue.",
    "fullText": "Dating apps' original pitch was to match you with anyone.\n\n\"Swipe. Match. Chat. Date.\" That was Tinder's promise when it launched more than a decade ago, forecasting the endless cycle so many of its users now bemoan.\n\nNow they want to match you with the one.\n\nThe giants in the dating space — Match Group's Hinge and Tinder, Grindr, and Bumble — are investing tens of millions into artificial intelligence, hoping to beat each other and the new AI-driven upstarts in the ultimate dating game.\n\nWhile, technically speaking, AI and machine learning have been used by dating app algorithms for years, these generative AI features take it further.\n\nThe result, the companies say, will be meaningful: better matches, fewer swipes. Nothing short of \"magical,\" as Grindr's CEO George Arison put it on a recent earnings call.\n\n\"We're entering a platform shift with AI,\" Match Group CEO Spencer Rascoff said during a Los Angeles Tech Week panel in October. AI is \"changing everything\" about the company's dating apps, he added.\n\nThe space is ripe for change. The big players are struggling. There's frequent churn, the result of \"swipe fatigue,\" and many users are unwilling to shell out for premium features.\n\n\"It's been a really long time since there's been a new reason — whether technology, platform, brand, whatever — for consumers to be excited about dating,\" Sam Yagan, cofounder of OkCupid and former CEO of Match Group, told Business Insider.\n\nMatch Group's stock is down more than 75% over the past five years. Last month, the company reported quarterly results that missed Wall Street's earnings and revenue estimates. It is struggling to convert users into paying customers, a category that declined 5% last quarter compared to the same period a year ago.\n\nThe share price for Bumble, meanwhile, is down more than 50% this year alone. The company laid off 30% of its staff over the summer, and last quarter, the app's paying users fell 18% from the same period last year.\n\n\"They've gone through this period over the past few years where users have started to contract, and there's been this question of why,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Nathan Feather told Business Insider. \"Simply, the product doesn't work as well as people expect it to.\"\n\nStartups are hoping to capitalize on that weakness. Several new apps have raised millions over the past couple of years. Just this month, Hinge founder Justin McLeod stepped down as CEO to found his own AI dating platform.\n\nCupid, matchmakers, classifieds, dating websites, swiping apps.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, they all attempt to solve the same problem: helping you find the perfect match. AI, companies say, will do that better than all of the above.\n\nIt makes sense for AI to infiltrate the space, Rick Heitzmann, the cofounder of VC firm FirstMark, which is not invested in any dating companies, told Business Insider. Matchmakers are a type of agent, and anything that can be agentified is a good match for AI, he said.\n\nFor the biggest players, finding the \"better fit\" is the ultimate goal of their AI investments.\n\nHinge is working on improving its match-making algorithm, and Bumble has an AI product scheduled to roll out next year. They are also using AI for profile creation, flirting, and trust and safety — in service of expediting the match-making process.\n\nTinder is plowing ahead. The app is piloting Chemistry, a matchmaking feature that gives users a \"daily drop\" of ideal matches based on a dater's camera roll and answers to a series of prompts. The goal is matches driven more by values, less by how hot a photo is — and ultimately fewer of the swipes that used to be at the heart of its branding.\n\nThat fewer swipes part is key. Hilary Paine, Tinder's VP of product, told Business Insider that AI-driven matchmaking is a way to stay competitive in the attention economy.\n\n\"AI is pushing every consumer app toward personalization,\" she said. \"The more that we can do to get you efficiently to a spark and a connection, a conversation, hopefully a date, that's a better experience for you.\"\n\nEven Grindr — long considered more of a hookup marketplace than a matchmaker — is trying its hand at AI.\n\nGrindr, which gained a reputation as a place where gay men go to seek short flings with faceless profiles, has added a recommendation feature using AI. There's a \"For You\" feed with profiles of users who might be a good match, and \"A-List,\" another matching recommendation feed based on profiles with which the user has already chatted.\n\nIt's still an open question about whether these AI features will work — and whether they'll be popular. Tinder's Paine said that Chemistry is performing well with Gen Z, the app's key demographic. Grindr's chief product officer AJ Balance said that recommendations are a \"very strong early hit.\"\n\nAs Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok put it: \"You can't just take a product that's out of favor, put AI on top of it and say, 'OK, now we have a product that's in favor.\"\n\nOne longtime Grindr user, Paul Lazo, isn't impressed. The 33-year-old video editor from Philadelphia has been on the app for 11 years and now pays $19.99 a month for the Pro version.\n\nHe's found its recommendations lackluster.\n\n\"I'm very much into bears and larger men,\" Lazo told Business Insider. But Lazo said his \"For You\" page is filled with young, fit men.\n\nThe feature is new this year and could still improve. A Grindr spokesperson said the For You product still runs on older machine learning.\n\nWaiting in the wings is a new batch of AI-first dating startups seeking to attract dissatisfied users before Tinder, Hinge, and the like can catch up.\n\n\"In the same way that mobile gave birth to Tinder and Bumble, AI could give birth to two multibillion-dollar companies,\" said Yagan, the cofounder of OkCupid and former CEO of Match Group.\n\nThe app Sitch, for example, has raised a total of $9 million since launching in 2024 and charges users $90 for three matches. Its AI is trained on cofounder Nandini Mullaji's experience as a real-life matchmaker; it brings daters a handful of \"set-ups\" each week and provides an AI matchmaking chatbot.\n\n\"We understand people have been burned in the past,\" Mullaji told Business Insider in April. \"We are coming in and saying, 'Hey, we have a business model shift, and we have a total platform shift.'\"\n\nThere's a new fleet of similar apps pitching AI as a Hail Mary for dating apps. Known, Ditto, and Amata each launched AI-matchmaking apps this year.\n\nPlus, traditionally non-romantic players are trying their hand.\n\nFacebook has introduced an AI dating assistant that acts like a matchmaker, combing through the platform's rolodex of users to find \"someone that I could bring home to my parents\" or \"a Brooklyn tech bro who would go to EDM concerts with me,\" product manager Neha Kumar told Business Insider in October.\n\nSome big names are lining up behind Facebook. Amanda Bradford, who founded The League before selling it to Match Group in 2022, put her money on the \"dark horse\" for the incumbent to best leverage AI.\n\n\"They're the only actual 'tech company' of the bunch, and the only one who seriously invests in and has true product, engineering, and AI talent,\" Bradford said.\n\nStill, it will be an uphill climb for the startups. Dating apps need to reach a critical mass of users to be successful.\n\n\"Incumbents have a huge benefit,\" said Heitzmann, the venture capitalist.",

    "description": "As a parent, self-regulation is hard — especially when things feel out of control. As someone who studies this, here's how I'm working to improve.",
    "fullText": "As someone who researches self-regulation for a living, it's a little ironic to admit that I can really struggle with regulating my emotions as a parent.\n\nOver the past few months, I've been writing a book about improving young children's self-regulation. I've read through a ton of research, written many chapters, and published papers on this very topic, but when my 3-year-old purposely dumps water on the floor, my initial response is to yell.\n\nBut, after all that research, I've discovered two things to be true: my 3-year-old needs more help developing his self-regulation — and so do I. Even with all of my knowledge in this area, I have found it challenging to follow my own advice, especially when things get stressful at home.\n\nClinically speaking, self-regulation is the ability to regulate your behaviors and emotions, which can include quickly shifting your attention away from what you are doing to another task (cooking dinner and managing your toddler's behavior) as well as trying to suppress an action that you know is inappropriate (harsh tones or yelling) and replacing it with a better action (calmly talking).\n\nI've noticed that I especially struggle with shifting my attention, which has become even harder since we recently welcomed our second son into our family. With two kids, my attention is being pulled in several different directions now, which makes completing simple tasks ever harder.\n\nI may try to clean up after dinner, while my 3-year-old is demanding that he wants to go outside with me instead of my wife, and my baby is covered in food, and there's double the noise. This significantly increases the demands on my own self-regulation, and has led to my struggling to keep a calm tone with my energetic 3-year-old.\n\nProfessionally, I know the greatest gift I can give my sons is being a well-regulated father. What we model in the home is critically important in our children's development. Research indicates that when parents exhibit anxious behavior, children are more likely to develop anxiety. The same is true for modeling physical activity, healthy eating habits, and cell phone use. How we parent our children is related to how they develop self-regulation. Even with the knowledge that my struggles with self-regulation can be directly linked to my sons' development, it's still been a struggle to make changes in my behavior.\n\nThere are many ways to help develop self-regulation in young children, like through free play and games. The games you played as a child, such as Red Light, Green Light, have been shown to help develop these regulatory skills. Your child's ability to stop when they want to keep going is the same skill they'll need in real-life situations, like pausing instead of running away from you at the store.\n\nThere are a few things I am doing to try to manage my own regulation. First, I am trying to build awareness of when and where I am feeling the most frustrated throughout the day. For me, that usually ends up being when we need to get out the door in the morning and at dinner time. To help, my wife and I have brainstormed ways to change our routines, which have helped reduce frustrations all around.\n\nThese frustrating moments, of course, are a recurring part of family life. In these moments, like when our children refuse to sleep, I have tried to make deep breathing a key first step in calming my body.\n\nI have also started to self-talk, using my inner monologue to remind myself that my kids will eventually fall asleep; they just need a little support. That awareness has been very helpful.\n\nFinally, I have started incorporating more regular cardio into my routine, which was challenging to do with the limited time I have in my day, but it has been worth it. Through activating different parts of the brain, cardio has been shown to enhance self-regulation, improve mood, and reduce stress. I almost always feel better after a sweat session.\n\nAll of these strategies are helping me stay more engaged and present with my kids. As they continue to grow, I want to show them that I, too, can work and improve my own behavior, just as we are asking them to. Being more thoughtful and purposeful with self-regulation has led to a happier and calmer home, and who doesn't want that?",

    "description": "Miss Universe 2025 was plagued with controversy from the start. We spoke to over a dozen contestants to learn how the pageant fell apart.",
    "fullText": "The energy in the room couldn't have been more tense. Some women were yelling, telling their new friends to stand up and leave. Others were glued to their seats, crying in red-carpet-worthy gowns. Contestant Andromeda Peters was in the middle of it all.\n\nA licensed therapist since 2017, Peters felt compelled to help. She instructed the women to close their eyes and feel their backs against the chairs, to feel their feet planted firmly to the ground, some in their 6-inch stilettos. Then she began to lead the group through a breathwork exercise: Breathe in for four seconds, hold for four seconds, she said, and now exhale.\n\nIt was the very first day of Miss Universe.\n\n\"We were all distraught,\" Peters, who was Miss Ghana 2025, told Business Insider about her fellow contestants. \"I was going to walk out, but then I realized, there's a girl crying next to me and she's holding my hand. There's a girl behind me crying. So I helped my sisters ground themselves.\"\n\nChaos had erupted among the pageant queens after Miss Universe director Nawat Itsaragrisil yelled at Miss Mexico Fátima Bosch. Their confrontation was captured on livestream, kicking off what would become one of the messiest competitions in the pageant's 74-year history. When Bosch was ultimately named the new Miss Universe on November 21, many contestants wondered if they had ever really stood a chance at the crown.\n\nOver the weeks that followed, contestants that Business Insider spoke with would accuse the organization of grueling conditions, favoritism, inconsistent rules, and an ever-changing judging process. Interviews with more than a dozen contestants reveal how a pageant marketed as a women's empowerment platform had fallen apart as the world watched.\n\nNow, some believe that only a dramatic leadership change can fix Miss Universe.\n\n\"I could give you the pageant answer, or I could just be real: Everyone has to go, absolutely everyone,\" Miss Haiti Melissa Sapini said.\n\nThe Miss Universe Organization did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAs November neared, 120 women packed their bags and began the journey to Thailand, where they'd spend a month attending events across Bangkok, Phuket, and Pattaya.\n\nFor many contestants, walking the Miss Universe stage was a childhood dream finally coming true. Some were seasoned pageant queens with multiple crowns and sashes glittering on their shelves. Others were first-timers. Miss Bonaire Nicole Peiliker-Visser was inspired to compete after her daughter won Mini Miss Universe, while Miss Hungary Kincső Dezsény was searching for a purpose beyond modeling.\n\n\"If you get beauty from … God, you need to use it for good,\" Dezsény told Business Insider.\n\nWhatever their motivation, the women thought they knew what to expect. The three-week competition would kick off with sponsorship events and media opportunities as they traveled throughout Thailand. Then, contestants would return to the capital to compete in the evening gown, swimsuit, national costume, and interview competitions. A panel of judges would determine the results, though one woman would be able to earn a spot in the top 30 by winning the \"People's Choice\" category in Miss Universe's official fan-voting app.\n\nMeanwhile, trouble was already brewing within the pageant's leadership.\n\nThis year's event was organized by Itsaragrisil, a controversial figure in the pageant world known as \"Papa Nawat.\" The Thai businessman, who took over the Miss Thailand pageant in February, has repeatedly come under fire for shaming beauty queens at Miss Grand International, a separate competition he founded in 2013. The flashy and over-the-top production is built around Itsaragrisil's \"4B Framework:\" beauty, body, brains, and business.\n\nTo kick off the Miss Universe pageant, the Miss Thailand Organization announced it would host a \"special dinner and talk show\" with Itsaragrisil, Miss Universe 2024 Victoria Kjær Theilvig, and a select group of 2025 contestants. This exclusive dinner, which had been a fixture of Miss Grand International, had never been done at Miss Universe. Fan voting would determine the 10 contestants who would be allowed to attend.\n\nThough some Miss Universe contestants promoted the dinner, they weren't all on board. Some women worried that scoring a seat at the table could influence final judging during the actual pageant. Miss Canada Jaime VandenBerg told Business Insider that she didn't \"condone what feels like women being auctioned off for dinner with a man.\"\n\nThe dinner was eventually canceled after Miss Universe called it an \"unauthorized activity.\" The organization's president, Raul Rocha, reiterated in a November 3 letter that only the four traditional categories of competition would be considered in the judging.\n\nA spokesperson for Itsaragrisil told Business Insider that the dinner had been \"a sponsor campaign designed to help contestants express their personalities.\" Following Rocha's letter, the spokesperson said many contestants believed all other activities were optional, and more than 30 contestants refused to participate in sponsorship events.\n\n\"Sponsor-related activities are a necessary and standard component of any international pageant production,\" the spokesperson added. \"Sponsors rightfully expect visibility and engagement in return for their contributions.\"\n\nThe rising tensions came to a head on November 4, the first official day of the pageant, during the confrontation between Itsaragrisil and Bosch. All the pageant queens had been gathered to receive their official Miss Universe sashes, a tradition one contestant compared to the opening ceremony at the Olympics, but the event didn't begin as planned.\n\n\"We're going in excited for this big moment that everyone lives for,\" Peters said. \"This was supposed to be our moment to shine at Miss Universe, and then we're all being yelled at.\"\n\nContestants told Business Insider that Itsaragrisil said he had a list of 20 countries refusing to do sponsorship posts on social media and repeatedly asked the women to \"own up to it\" before he started calling out specific countries.\n\n\"It got to the point where no one even moved because you felt like if you flinched, he would just call you up,\" Sapini said. \"All I'm thinking is, 'Oh my God, please don't say Haiti.'\"\n\nWhen Itsaragrisil turned his attention to Bosch, a heated back-and-forth began. She told the director, \"You are not respecting me as a woman,\" and he called for security to remove her from the room. Bosch walked out instead, with dozens of contestants following behind her.\n\n\"She was shaking,\" VandenBerg said of Bosch. \"She had tears in her eyes. Victoria popped in and said, 'Girls, you don't have to put up with this,' and I was one of the first to walk out.\"\n\n\"I was so shocked and angered by the lack of respect that I just did not want to be in that room anymore,\" said Miss Armenia Peggy Garabekian, who was among the first to leave. \"Then a few of my delegate sisters messaged me and said, 'Peggy, he's not letting us out.'\"\n\nThe women had been seated in alphabetical order for the sashing ceremony, so contestants at the back of the room didn't have a chance to leave before the Miss Universe staff shut the doors.\n\n\"You're at a loss because you're uncertain and trying to stay calm,\" Miss Malaysia Chloe Lim, who was unable to exit the room, said. \"At that moment, we were wondering, 'Is the competition still going to happen?'\"\n\n\"It got me really anxious about the legitimacy of the whole event,\" Miss Hong Kong Lizzie Li said.\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said staff temporarily closed the door because \"a large number of press and media were gathered directly outside the room, creating a volatile environment.\"\n\nThe online backlash was swift, but it wasn't just directed at Itsaragrisil. Some contestants who didn't leave the room were \"being bullied really badly\" by fans on social media, Peters said.\n\n\"I feel like nobody in the organization did enough; they didn't care about our mental state and what everyone went through,\" Peiliker-Visser, who said she faced online harassment, told Business Insider.\n\nOn the day of the confrontation, Rocha said Itsaragrisil's participation would be limited or eliminated entirely. Yet contestants said he only missed a few events, and Itsaragrisil was quickly and quietly reintroduced.\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson told Business Insider that Rocha's promise to limit the director's presence was never \"operationally realistic.\" The spokesperson added, \"Nawat continued attending activities because he was the only individual with the authority and understanding to ensure the pageant could continue.\"\n\nItsaragrisil tearfully apologized the day after the incident, telling reporters, \"I am human. I didn't want to do anything like that.\"\n\nTurn on a Miss Universe competition, and you'll see the three-hour culmination of a weekslong whirlwind experience. While the sea of shimmering sashes and sparkling gowns may look glamorous, there's a lot of sacrifice off-screen.\n\nFor many women, the pressure of the competition was sky-high. After all, these pageant queens weren't just representing themselves — they were each representing an entire nation. Some women came from countries that had sent them abroad to train with top runway coaches or create couture costumes with the most in-demand designers. Contestants from smaller countries, which typically don't have many sponsors, had paid thousands of dollars out of pocket for their gowns alone.\n\nOnce they arrived in Thailand, contestants had to travel to multiple events each day, sometimes taking flights in the middle of the night before they were expected to participate in various activities, fulfill a daily checklist of social media sponsorship posts, and fight off crowds of passionate bloggers and fans — all while looking picture-perfect.\n\nContestants said they were forbidden from using hairstylists and makeup artists to help them prepare for each day's events, so they would regularly wake up at 3 a.m. to get competition-ready. Some simply slept with their makeup on.\n\nWhen food poisoning or an illness hit, as it frequently did throughout the weeks of competition, many women had to decide whether to rest or miss an important rehearsal. Sometimes, they didn't have a choice. Dezsényi said her bout with food poisoning was so bad that she spent four days in the hospital — but still made it to the final show.\n\nAfter these long days, the women were greeted at the hotel lobby by hordes of fans or pageant bloggers seeking an interview. Contestants told Business Insider that, unlike past Miss Universe competitions, they hadn't been given chaperones to help manage the crowds.\n\n\"They said, 'We're not going to have chaperones because you're grown women,' but at the same time, you're putting us in the public spotlight,\" VandenBerg said. \"To not have security, to me, is kind of crazy.\"\n\nSteve Byrne, the onstage host of this year's competition, told Business Insider that he was shocked by how the Miss Universe Organization treated the women.\n\n\"These girls are cooped up for almost 30 days,\" he said. \"Every day, they have to go to a sponsored dinner. They have to go to this resort and pretend they're having fun at the pool. To me, it seemed everyone was losing sight of what's important here. Is anybody thinking about these women? That's what bothered me.\"\n\nSome contestants enjoyed the action-packed itinerary, which included everything from Muay Thai lessons to gala dinners. Miss India Manika Vishwakarma said she appreciated the \"incredible focus on fan interactions.\"\n\nOthers were dismayed by the daily sponsorship events and noticed a lack of philanthropy in the line-up. Miss Universe's former president, Paula Shugart, told Business Insider that contestants previously participated in an average of three philanthropy events. This year had none.\n\n\"I'm a representative of my country, and you're telling me, 'Hey, hold this dietary protein powder or take photos with this luggage,'\" Garabekian said. \"Throughout the month, we could have been taken to a hospital, orphanage, school, anywhere where we could have helped people in need.\"\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said the Miss Universe Organization did not request any philanthropy events in Thailand, instead focusing on its digital advocacy platform, \"Beyond the Crown,\" which required contestants to film a video explaining how they used their title to uplift social causes.\n\n\"Sash factor\" is a well-known term in the pageant community, bestowed upon the countries that treat Miss Universe like their own Super Bowl. These fan bases dissect the contestants' every move with the rigor of a fantasy line-up. Their national queen, the star quarterback, is typically rewarded with millions of social media followers.\n\nMiss Universe is designed to be a fair competition, but even the contestants recognize that the playing field isn't exactly equal. Countries with significant \"sash factor\" tend to have more sponsors to cover the costs of the gowns and training, and typically receive far more fan attention outside their country. Contestants said that favoritism was also apparent among this year's official sponsors for the pageant, who were selecting queens from \"sash factor\" countries for more photo shoots and media appearances.\n\n\"They really are looking for women who are popular and have lots of followers,\" said Peiliker-Visser. \"And if you don't, you just don't count.\"\n\nAppealing to sponsors has always been necessary to help fund the pageant, but Shugart said in years past it typically wasn't the main focus of the contestants' activities. This year, though, multiple women said they were brought into a room and asked to explain any missing sponsorship posts for each brand that had partnered with Miss Universe during the competition.\n\n\"I found this extremely unusual and uncomfortable,\" Garabekian said. \"It made me feel more like a tool for sponsorship obligations, rather than someone there to contribute meaningfully.\"\n\nItsaragrisil's spokesperson said the sponsor checklist was a \"standard operational requirement, not an unusual demand,\" and no contestant was \"forced or penalized\" for a lack of posts.\n\n\"It is important to emphasize: MUO is not a charitable organization,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nAs the competition progressed, multiple contestants said it became apparent that some women were secretly using makeup artists and hairstylists to get them competition-ready every morning. This hurt morale, particularly among the pageant queens from smaller countries.\n\n\"They scared us so much about the hairstylists and makeup artists, we didn't even try to think about it,\" said Peiliker-Visser. \"But these girls were allowed. I said, 'Oh, they must be special because they're allowed everything.'\"\n\nAfter several contestants complained, a staff member from Miss Universe held a meeting.\n\n\"They said, 'Girls, we understand there's a lot of favoritism, and maybe you're feeling down about it. We just want you to know that it's the sponsors and has nothing to do with the results of Miss Universe. We're looking for small countries with big hearts, too,'\" Sapini said.\n\nContestants said the organization promised to take disciplinary action against those who brought makeup artists and stylists, but women continued to break the rules and still placed in the top 30 or better.\n\nWhile contestants attended events, fans were logging into the Miss Universe app to vote — after watching ads or purchasing votes in bundles — in categories ranging from best skin and evening gown to \"Aura of the Day\" and \"People's Choice.\"\n\nThe \"People's Choice\" winner would automatically earn a spot in the top 30 — a prize that has become popular across various pageant systems in recent years — but contestants told Business Insider they were unsure whether fan votes would impact anything else.\n\nConflicting messages made it worse. Rocha's November 3 statement said contestants were judged only in the four traditional categories — evening, swimsuit, national costume, and interview. Yet the app said votes contributed \"10% to the final score of the top 30 placement.\"\n\nPeiliker-Viser said the Miss Universe Organization told her national director before the competition that fan votes wouldn't count. \"My director was really concerned because we're a population of 26,000 people,\" she added. \"How are they going to measure a small island like Bonaire with other countries?\"\n\nFor Sapini, it was upsetting to watch people in Haiti work hard to vote for her when there was so much ambiguity around their worth.\n\n\"Haiti is a poverty-stricken country, and people in these villages collected their money to send to the Miss Universe Organization because they held onto hope that this would be something good for our country,\" she said. \"But the voting system was all over the place. It made no sense.\"\n\nMiss Universe hurtled toward its final days just as it began — with more confusion.\n\nSpeculation surrounding who was judging this year's competition began circulating online as judges started dropping out. Behind the scenes, contestants said they were just as unsure about who was deciding their fate.\n\nThree days before the November 21 final, composer Omar Harfouch dropped out as a judge, accusing the Miss Universe Organization of carrying out a \"secret vote\" to select the top 30 without the official judging panel. Former soccer star Claude Makélélé exited the same day due to \"unforeseen personal reasons.\"\n\nHarfouch also said Princess Camilla di Borbone delle Due Sicilie resigned that week, but VandenBerg said her exit had been misconstrued and that \"she dropped out so far in advance.\" The princess never publicly explained why.\n\nIn a statement, Miss Universe said Harfouch was confused by its announcement of an eight-person selection committee for the pageant's new \"Beyond the Crown\" program, which they said operated \"entirely independently\" to select a winner that had no bearing on the final results. Contestants told Business Insider it was unclear what the winner of the \"Beyond the Crown\" title would receive.\n\nThat statement added more fuel to the rumors, as pageant fans said on social media that James Irvin Healy, one of the \"Beyond the Crown\" judges, was in a relationship with Miss Paraguay, Yanina Gómez, and began circulating pictures of them together.\n\nGómez, who went on to win \"Beyond the Crown\" and \"People's Choice,\" never publicly addressed the allegations that she was in a relationship with one of the judges, which fans considered a significant conflict of interest. Meanwhile, the Miss Universe Organization removed Healy's picture from its November 17 Instagram post announcing the eight-person panel.\n\nGómez and Healy didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nTo maintain transparency, Miss Universe previously relied on a separate preliminary selection committee, which it'd announce on Instagram, to decide which contestants advanced to the top 30 ahead of the televised finals. No such distinction or announcement was made this year.\n\nSome contestants said they were surprised when they walked into their closed-door interview and saw an eight-person panel that included Theilvig, then-Miss Universe CEO Mario Búcaro — who stepped down on December 12, less than two months after taking over the role — a past Miss Thailand, and some Miss Universe staff members.\n\n\"I've never done a pageant where the staff was judging you,\" said Peters, who has competed since 2014. \"You typically want a panel of judges with different experiences, backgrounds, and opinions.\"\n\nAs confusion swirled around the judges, a terrible accident occurred during the preliminary evening gown competition. Contestants were devastated after Miss Jamaica Gabrielle Henry fell off the stage. She remains hospitalized with serious injuries.\n\n\"I'll be honest, there was a dark cloud hovering over the set the whole time,\" said Byrne, the onstage host. \"I didn't think it could get worse. Then it got worse than worse.\"\n\nThe Miss Universe final began at 8 a.m. local time so that it could air live during the US primetime. Contestants arrived at 1 a.m. for their call time. \"We were making jokes with each other backstage, trying to keep our energy up,\" Peters said. \"It literally felt like we were in survivor mode.\"\n\nThe final two came down to Bosch and Miss Thailand Praveenar Singh. When the host called Miss Mexico's name, he said the stadium filled with boos. It could've been locals rooting for Miss Thailand, passionate supporters of fan favorite Miss Côte d'Ivoire Olivia Yacé — who placed fourth runner-up — or the shock of Bosch winning after her dramatic start to the pageant. Whatever the reason, Byrne said he knew it would be bad for Bosch.\n\n\"I thought, 'Boy, this woman is going to be put through the wringer,\" he said.\n\nAs fans started to doubt the legitimacy of the results online, Miss Universe 2005 Natalie Glebova — who joined the judging panel after Harfouch resigned — posted a picture of Singh, the runner-up, on Instagram with the caption \"My winner!\"\n\nGlebova also noted that, unlike past Miss Universe competitions, there had been no accounting firm to audit the results. \"Until then, I don't think I will be participating as a judge again,\" she added.\n\nIn the hours following the announcement of the winner, questions about the integrity of the judging process intensified. Harfouch said on Instagram that the organization's president, Rocha, had told him to vote for Bosch before he resigned as a judge. Fans also alleged that Bosch's father had done business with one of Rocha's companies, a claim the pageant queen denied.\n\nRocha said one of his companies had a 2023 contract with Pemex, where Bosch's father works, but it was \"impossible\" that there was any connection between that and Bosch's win. Her father added in a November 25 statement that his role at Pemex had nothing to do with awarding contracts and that he'd only met Rocha for the first time at the Miss Mexico 2025 pageant in September.\n\nIn a separate statement, the president told pageant fans that there were \"countless situations\" during the three weeks of Miss Universe that went into deciding the winner, appearing to contradict his previous statement that only the four categories of competition would be used during the judging process.\n\nDuring a November 24 interview on Mexican journalist Adela Micha's news show, Rocha seemed to indicate that one of those factors was the strength of a contestant's passport. He told Micha that a Côte d'Ivoire passport, which requires visas for 175 countries, would have made it difficult for Yacé to travel as Miss Universe if she had won the crown.\n\n\"She's going to be the Miss Universe who spent a whole year in an apartment because of the cost of visa processes, of lawyers,\" he said.\n\nThat same day, Yacé announced that she was resigning as Miss Universe Africa and Oceania — a title she received after placing fourth runner-up — because her values no longer aligned with the organization.\n\nContestants defended Yacé and questioned whether women from smaller countries ever stood a chance. In fact, multiple contestants that Business Insider spoke with said similar comments were made about their own passports during the competition.\n\n\"We need to be valued by our work and what we did onstage, not on the strength of our passport,\" Miss Turks and Caicos Bereniece Dickenson said.\n\nMiss Universe's leadership has weathered several controversies since it changed hands in October 2022. During his interview with Micha, Rocha said he was \"fed up\" with owning Miss Universe and was looking to sell his 50% stake. What he didn't mention was the organization's growing list of legal issues.\n\nThe other half of the organization is owned by JKN Global Group, whose founder, former Miss Universe CEO Anne Jakrajutatip, stepped down in June after the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that she had included false or misleading information in the financial statements. On November 26, the Associated Press reported that a Bangkok court had issued an arrest warrant for Jakrajutatip in an ongoing fraud case. Jakrajutatip hasn't commented.\n\nThat same day, news broke that an arrest warrant had also been issued for Rocha in an investigation involving alleged weapons and drugs trafficking, fuel theft, and organized criminal activity. A Mexican official later said that there was no evidence of organized crime money within Miss Universe. By December 5, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit had frozen Rocha's bank accounts.\n\nAmid the flurry of legal action, Miss Universe addressed rumors that a Thailand-based cryptocurrency company, TCG Social Media Group, had purchased the pageant. In a December 3 statement, the organization said it was aware of TCG's interest but was not in the midst of any sale or negotiation. TCG Social Media Group could not be reached for comment.\n\nSome contestants believe that new leadership would help Miss Universe regain its sparkle.\n\n\"I genuinely hope the Miss Universe Organization focuses on transparency,\" Miss Bulgaria Gaby Guha said. \"Clearer rules, consistent communication, and a visible decision-making process all help build trust, not just for contestants, but for fans who invest their passion into the competition.\"\n\n\"No matter who wins or who owns the pageant, the power is in the dream and what you do with it,\" VandenBerg said. \"You can still believe in the dream, the sisterhood, and the impact Miss Universe has made over decades.\"\n\nFor others, though, the drama at this year's pageant is too much to overcome.\n\n\"This is just despicable behavior to me,\" Sapini, who also competed at Miss USA in 2024, told Business Insider. \"I can't preach to the next generation of girls that this should be your dream.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad I saw what it's like because this world is insane,\" Peiliker-Visser said. \"It's my daughter's dream to go to Miss Universe, but my kids are not doing this.\"",

When that didn't happen, he found a way to remain close to the action — interning at Madison Square Garden, joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee, and completing the NFL's rotational program across media, business development, and strategy.\n\nHe thought he'd stay there and ascend the ranks. But he decided on a different path that seemed to align more with his interests: finance.\n\nAfter earning his MBA and working in investment banking, he joined Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners, a fund established with the NBA to buy minority stakes in teams.\n\nCardinez has since worked on multiple franchise deals, including the Phoenix Suns' $4 billion sale and a 2024 transaction involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nKress' path to high finance began in academic research, studying anthropology and psychology at Notre Dame and conducting fieldwork in Sierra Leone before pursuing graduate work on Angola's energy sector at the University of Oxford. She later worked at political research and consultancy firm, Eurasia Group, training investors to integrate geopolitical risk into decision-making.\n\nKress came to BlackRock first as an advisor to Tom Donilon, the former US national security advisor, a post she called a \"dream job.\" She helped Donilon elevate the firm's geopolitics function into a permanent part of the BlackRock Investment Institute.\n\nBut she didn't stop there. This year, Kress was named the chief of staff to Larry Fink, the firm's powerful CEO. She told Business Insider that this new job was the \"culmination\" of her career, offering \"unparalleled exposure\" to global policymakers and business leaders.\n\nJack Levendoski, JPMorgan Chase\n\nLevendoski grew up all over the world — from Louisiana to London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia — before beginning his career as a facilities engineering project manager at Chevron.\n\nIn that role, he supported offshore oil and gas work in the Gulf of Mexico. Levendoski later moved into investment banking and is now an executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, advising on high-profile technology and software transactions.\n\nMenasche admits he didn't always feel like a natural fit for the finance industry — he didn't grow up in a household of bankers, he said, and he studied chemistry and math at Cambridge. But after trying academic research, he found the lab's pace too slow. That realization led him to roles that blended analytical work with more day-to-day momentum, eventually steering him into secondaries.\n\nToday, Menasche is a managing director and global cohead of Goldman Sachs' private capital and liquidity solutions group, working across real estate, infrastructure, private equity, and venture capital transactions.\n\nJackie Shepherd, Morgan Stanley\n\nBefore joining the ranks of Wall Street, Shepherd spent years competing in Division I golf, earning a full-ride scholarship and captaining the University of Minnesota's team. She began her career in accounting at EY's international tax practice, where she first encountered investment banking.\n\n\"I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two,\" she told Business Insider. \"I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas.\" So she made the pivot to Wall Street.\n\nAfter holding roles at Goldman Sachs and Citi, she joined Morgan Stanley's separations and structured solutions group. Shepherd has worked on roughly $250 billion in transactions, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks.\n\nGolf, she said, remains a key part of her life, adding that aspires to play on all seven continents.",

    "description": "Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul includes the elimination of the Grad PLUS program. Yale said it's putting out a \"comparable\" new plan.",
    "fullText": "Graduate and professional students could soon find themselves with more limited student-loan options. Yale has a plan.\n\nThe Yale School of Public Health posted on LinkedIn last week that it will \"soon introduce a replacement loan option\" for student-loan borrowers who are affected by President Donald Trump's plan to eliminate the Grad PLUS program as part of his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nGrad PLUS allowed graduate and professional students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. Trump's legislation eliminated the program and implemented new borrowing caps: a $100,000 lifetime cap for graduate students and a $200,000 lifetime cap for professional students.\n\nYale said that its new program would \"offer comparable, if not more competitive, loan terms compared to previous Grad PLUS loans,\" adding that more details will be available soon. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nIn addition to Yale, Bloomberg reported that other schools, such as Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania, are also working to establish financing options for students pursuing advanced degrees, including working with private lenders for additional financing.\n\nEducation policy experts previously told Business Insider that limiting borrowing for advanced degrees could push students to either forgo their programs or turn to the private loan market, which could have riskier terms with higher interest rates.\n\nTrump's Department of Education is set to roll out the student-loan borrowing changes in July 2026. It will affect new students. Existing borrowers will be able to retain their financing options. The department is also introducing its new Repayment Assistance Plan in July, which is intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans.\n\nSome advocates and Democratic lawmakers have previously expressed concern with the elimination of Grad PLUS and the new caps on borrowing for advanced degrees. The Department of Education proposed a new definition of \"professional,\" compiling a list of 10 programs, like medicine and dentistry, that would qualify for the higher borrowing cap.\n\nEarlier this month, over 140 bipartisan lawmakers signed onto a letter urging the department to revise the limits to include advanced nursing programs in the professional degree designation.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the letter said.\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, told Business Insider that \"we expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"",

    "description": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway removed Kraft Heinz from its subsidiary webpage before leaving its board and writing down its stake by $5 billion.",
    "fullText": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway removed Kraft Heinz from the list of operating companies on its website earlier this year, weeks before writing down its investment in the food and beverage giant and leaving its board of directors.\n\nThe famed investor's conglomerate took Kraft off its subsidiaries page in April, Business Insider determined using the Wayback Machine, a digital archive that stores snapshots of webpages on different dates.\n\nBerkshire accounts for its roughly 27% stake in Kraft using the equity method, meaning Buffett and his colleagues recorded it at cost and periodically adjust its carrying value to reflect Berkshire's share of Kraft's profits and losses.\n\nOn May 19, Berkshire's two board representatives stepped down. Berkshire also said in its second-quarter earnings that it was recording a $5 billion impairment loss on its Kraft position, cutting its carrying value to match its fair value of $8.4 billion.\n\nBuffett and his team said they had considered their \"ability and intent\" to remain invested until the fair value exceeded carrying value, the \"magnitude and duration\" of the decline in fair value, and Kraft's operating results and finances.\n\nThey also took into account the two board departures and the news that Kraft was evaluating potential strategic transactions, they said, and determined their unrealized loss on the holding was \"other-than-temporary.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether Berkshire removed Kraft from its subsidiary list as part of a broader distancing from the investment. Kraft was an unusual entry in the first place, as the vast majority of businesses featured are wholly owned subsidiaries of Berkshire, such as Geico, See's Candies, NetJets, and Pampered Chef.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway and Kraft Heinz did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nKraft announced in September that it would split into two businesses, with one focused on sauces, spreads, and seasonings such as Heinz and Philadelphia, and the other focusing on North American staples, including Kraft Singles and Lunchables.\n\nBerkshire partnered with 3G Capital, a Brazilian private equity firm, to acquire Heinz for around $23 billion in 2013. Two years later, the pair teamed up again to merge Heinz with Kraft in a $40 billion deal.\n\nSince then, the combined company has navigated layoffs, management reshuffles, huge writedowns, asset sales, a slumping stock price, aggressive cost controls, a federal accounting probe, and a prolonged decline in net revenues fueled by changing consumer preferences.\n\nDavid Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and a longtime Berkshire blogger, told Business Insider in September that merging Kraft and Heinz was a \"rare mistake\" for Buffett.\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha,\" who spent the past six decades transforming Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1 trillion company, will step down as CEO next week. Buffett's handpicked successor and Berkshire's non-insurance chief, Greg Abel, will take the reins on New Year's Day.",

    "description": "Throughout 2025, Business Insider spoke to a handful of entrepreneurs and side hustlers who found inventive ways to make money.",
    "fullText": "Climbing the corporate ladder isn't the only way to increase your earnings.\n\nThroughout 2025, Business Insider spoke to a handful of entrepreneurs and side hustlers who found inventive ways to make money, from firing up 3D printers to propagating rare houseplants.\n\nHere are three of the most creative money-making strategies we heard all year.\n\nMichael Satterlee learned about 3D printing and CAD (computer-aided design) modeling in a class he took his freshman year of high school. He took the skill and ran with it, printing a variety of products, including clog accessories, that he listed and sold on Etsy.\n\nIn 2025, he created a coozie spin-off that he calls a \"tactical reload can holder\" — and the internet can't get enough of it.\n\nPartly thanks to viral videos of the can holder in action, the 18-year-old's company, Cruise Cup, generated $300,000 in sales in November alone. His goal in 2026 is to transition to manufacturing his product in stainless steel, as his 130 printers can barely keep up with demand.\n\nE-commerce entrepreneurs are tapping into a new strategy to move product: Live selling, which combines livestreaming and e-commerce. Sellers are hosting live \"shows\" and chatting with their audience in real time, while viewers are buying directly from the stream without leaving the app.\n\nIt can be incredibly lucrative if you can find the right niche. Top sellers are earning five and six figures in a single livestream.\n\nHarry Luu is one of those sellers. He brought in $42,000 in one day by selling two rare plants — one for $26,000 and the other for $16,000 — on Palmstreet, a live shopping app specifically for rare plants and other unique goods.\n\nThe former mathematician, who left academia in 2024 to cultivate and sell plants full-time, is all in on the \"new age QVC\" strategy.\n\n\"It gives you the convenience of being at home, but also allows the buyer the flexibility of actually interacting and clarifying before they pull the trigger,\" he said. \"And I think that is one of the greatest advantages of live selling.\"\n\nTraditional rental real estate remains a tried-and-true wealth-building strategy, but buying a property, finding renters, and then managing the property and tenants is time-consuming. Property investors like Carl and Mindy Jensen, who have accumulated substantial savings, are adopting a more passive approach: private money lending.\n\nHere's how it works in a nutshell: The Jensens lend money to other investors to rehab a house, for example, and earn interest on the loan. They're essentially acting as the bank.\n\n\"We set the rate. There are some rules around it. For example, the rate can't be super cheap or else the IRS considers it a gift,\" the couple explained, referring to the applicable federal rate (AFR), which is the minimum interest rate the IRS allows for private loans, published monthly.\n\nVetting the borrower and the deal they're pursuing is essential — and time-consuming — but after the upfront due diligence, the ongoing involvement is minimal.\n\nThe neat thing about this money-making strategy? It's a \"win-win\" for both the lender and the borrower, confirmed investor Mike Gorius, who prefers working with private money lenders over traditional lenders: \"Things can just move a lot quicker. It's what allows us to buy properties in a matter of days versus a matter of weeks.\"",

    "title": "I worked remotely on a cross-country Amtrak train. The views were unbeatable, but I wish I'd known 3 things.",
    "description": "Working remotely on a 43-hour Amtrak train offered stunning views, but a reliable hotspot and backup power are essential.",
    "fullText": "The view from my desk at home in Los Angeles is pretty nice, as far as desk views go. I can see the lush landscaping of my neighbors' homes in the Silver Lake hills, and, if I lean to my right, the tops of the Verdugo Mountains north of Glendale — but it can get old.\n\nI recently traded it in for the ever-changing views that fly by on Amtrak's Southwest Chief, a 43-hour 2,265-mile train route from Los Angeles to Chicago that traverses through deserts stamped with deep red mesas, expansive farmlands, historic train stations, and the widest river in the continental US.\n\nAs someone who has worked remotely from a wide variety of places over the past decade, I also wanted to see how doable it would be on a cross-country train trip.\n\nVery doable, it turns out. It felt surprisingly similar to a normal couple of days of work — I answered emails, filed stories, and chatted with my editor — but with the added novelty of daily life on the train.\n\nI made it to Chicago without any flight delays or airport traffic, and without using up any PTO on travel time. And the views from my \"desk\" could not be beat.\n\nWhile I'd definitely do it again, there are a few things to keep in mind and plan for if you want to work remotely from an Amtrak train.\n\nAmtrak does not provide WiFi on all of its trains. Some trains and stations offer free WiFi, so it's best to check your specific route in advance.\n\nEven for those routes that do have WiFi, Amtrak says it only supports general web browsing, with limited streaming and large downloads, to ensure there's enough bandwidth for all passengers. If you have trouble connecting, Amtrak says you can report it to the conductor, but it doesn't offer technical support on board.\n\nThe Southwest Chief does not have WiFi, so I planned to rely on my cellphone's hotspot and hope for the best. I gave my boss a heads-up that my internet could be spotty, as I'd read online that cell service might come and go.\n\nThankfully, I found I had enough cell service to work on my laptop for the vast majority of the trip. There were occasionally moments where my connection would weaken or go out for a couple of minutes. Only once, somewhere in New Mexico, I lost service for about 30 minutes when I would've liked to have it.\n\nWhen I wasn't online, I did work that didn't require an internet connection, and it never lasted long enough to be a serious disruption.\n\nI had a \"Family Room\" sleeper car that had a bench and a fold-down table I could work at, which was incredibly handy. But I was surprised by the lack of outlets in the room, which spanned the width of the train. The one available outlet was located right in the center at shoulder height.\n\nMy big, heavy block of a MacBook charger would not stay in the socket on its own; I used duct tape to jerry-rig the charger so it would stay in place. Extra battery packs to charge our cellphones and other devices would've helped too. Outlet availability varies by sleeper car, so you'll want to check for your specific room.\n\nThe other option was to go to the community space, where outlets were plentiful. The observation car ended up being my favorite place to work from the train, and where I spent most of my time. In addition to the massive windows, there are full tables that are perfect for a more elaborate work setup. I was able to use my portable second screen, keyboard, and trackpad without feeling cramped.\n\nThe noise level was low during the day, like a quiet café, so I could've taken calls from there too, but for privacy's sake, I would trek down to my sleeper car when I needed to make a call.\n\nObservation car seats can fill up, so you may want to get there early to stake out your spot. My train was not especially busy, so it was easy for me to get a spot at a table any time I went in. One time that meant sharing the table with a stranger, but it only added to the communal vibe of the train.\n\nOne of the most charming aspects of riding Amtrak is the traditional dining service, where passengers are seated alongside strangers in the very cute, old-school dining car for every meal. Our sleeper car came with three meals a day, and the dining attendant would check in with us each day to reserve our preferred meal times.\n\nThat meant meal times were planned in advance and had to be within the set windows. When I sat down for a meal, I was sharing the table with new people and being served restaurant-style, so it would have been rude and inconvenient to pull out my laptop and work through lunch. The service was fast, but the three-course meals often ended up lasting about an hour.\n\nWhereas at home I typically wait for a slow moment in the day to take a quick 30-minute lunch, on the Amtrak, I had to stop whatever I was doing when it was time to eat and fully disconnect from work, chatting with new people over a meal instead.\n\nWhile you can get meals sent directly to your sleeper car instead, eating in the dining car is a key part of the Amtrak experience, so I recommend just keeping this in mind and planning your workday around it.\n\nIt was also a microcosm of the true appeal of working remotely on the Amtrak — disrupting your usual routine, getting out in the world, and experiencing places and people that you usually don't.",

    "fullText": "If TV commercials are to be believed, Target has a certain white-bearded employee named Kris K. who makes lengthy lists of the best gifts to buy from the Bullseye.\n\nBut what if Santa (or Mrs. Claus) needed to make a Target run?\n\nThe retailer has about 1,995 stores, and its northernmost location is just north of Anchorage, Alaska, in the city of Wasilla.\n\nDespite the numerous challenges of running a big box store in the frontier state — merchandise takes several weeks to arrive via boat — locations like the one in Wasilla do brisk business and help keep far-flung communities connected to the rest of the US.\n\nAmy Sevenski, the store's head of specialty sales, told Business Insider there aren't many national retail chains in Wasilla.\n\n\"Target is a place that you go to hang out, to walk around with your family,\" she said.\n\nThese rural stores also give retailers like Walmart and Target a head start in the kinds of smaller markets where Amazon is now seeking to make inroads.\n\nBacked by mountains and frequented by wildlife like roof eagles and parking lot moose, the store was Target's first location in Alaska in 2008. Two more opened shortly after in nearby Anchorage.\n\n\"The drive to Wasilla is the most beautiful drive you can take to a Target in the entire United States,\" said Justin Howells, Target's group vice president for the Pacific Northwest, in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nDanielle Hodgson, who has worked at the store since it first opened and now runs the beauty section, told Business Insider the holiday shopping season kicks off in earnest in October when each Alaskan gets an oil dividend check from the state.\n\n\"That's when you see a lot of traffic coming from the bush,\" she said. \"They have to fly into Anchorage and travel to Wasilla to go shopping.\"\n\nThe store has even served customers from as far away as Utqiaġvik, Alaska — also known as Barrow — on the Arctic coast.\n\n\"That's like the equivalent of somebody flying from New Jersey to Florida to pick up their supplies for the holiday,\" Howells said. \"Some of the guests here are coming from really far away to do their Target run.\"\n\nIn addition to having fresh cash to spend, winter offers further motivation for shoppers to get an early start.\n\n\"We're definitely at the mercy of the weather,\" Sevenski said. \"We have to do a lot of pivoting for sure.\"\n\nOne such pivot is the way the store handles drive-up fulfillment.\n\nSevenski said drive-up transactions are doubling each year, and that the orders are getting bigger, too. Since it's not always possible to keep the parking lot clear of snow, and regular carts would get bogged down, the team got creative.\n\n\"We call her Dolly Carton,\" Sevenski said. \"It's just a regular flat cart, and we've put some big beefy winter tires on it, built some bins onto it, because drive-up is something that has evolved so much here in Alaska.\"\n\nWhile Sevenski and Hodgson couldn't recall fulfilling any drive-up orders for customers in sleighs or on snow machines, they said trailers and U-Haul trucks were a common sight in the parking lot.\n\n\"They do have some larger baskets, because people are stocking up,\" Howells said. \"But we do see pretty comparable traffic compared to the rest of the US here, just they're buying different things — or more of it.\"\n\nHowells also said the store carries a similar cold-weather assortment to what other high-latitude Target locations offer, but Sevenski said two product categories see exceptional demand thanks to the area's sub-freezing temperatures and less than six hours of winter daylight.\n\n\"We're definitely selling a lot of washer fluid,\" she said — the de-icing kind.\n\n\"And coffee,\" she added. \"Our Starbucks does amazing here.\"",

This year's requests focus on the business world. (Santa Claus is a BI Today subscriber, obviously.)\n\nROI for AI. I'm legally required to start every 2025 recap or 2026 look-ahead by mentioning artificial intelligence. This isn't about bashing or praising AI, though. I just want to see some noticeable returns on all these massive AI projects. I'm not screaming about an AI bubble, but my palms get a little sweaty thinking about the ever-growing tech budgets. So, give us all some relief by showing that these AI tools are going to generate revenue.\n\nA solution to Wall Street's recruiting cycle. The worst thing that could happen to a junior banker is finding out their favorite Murray Hill brunch spot has shut down. The second-worst thing happened this year when big banks fought back against PE's early recruitment of them. The result upended a Wall Street tradition aspiring financiers had spent years preparing for. I was never a fan of the process, but the change left us in a weird no-man's land where none of the rules are apparent.\n\nPrediction markets predict their future. With a string of recent media partnerships, we're going to see a lot more data from prediction markets in 2026. Meanwhile, some state regulators aren't so pleased with their rise. So let's settle the debate. I'd like prediction markets to set a market speculating on their own future. Let the people decide!\n\nNo more media blackouts, please. I can't go through another two weeks of no sports because of carriage disputes. I know how this story ends (the customer paying more), and I also know there's nothing I can do about it. So just rip the bandage off, and let's avoid the grandstanding going forward.\n\nProtein, chill out. No food group is on a hotter run than the muscle-building nutrient. But it's flying too close to the sun. We've got protein in hot cocoa now?? I'm a self-admitted gym bro, and I know my whey around a protein shake (I hate myself for that joke), but even I need to put my foot down. Besides, overconsumption of protein could have a painful conclusion for some of us: kidney stones.\n\nThe New York Knicks to reach the NBA finals.

A modern number six who passes the ball but also wins it back.\n\n\"His orientation around the pitch is constantly on. He knows where he is, he knows where his team-mates are. Sometimes he jogs around and doesn't really get a sweat on but he knows where he needs to be in his position. Nobody can get the ball off him.\"\n\nPalace are now eighth in the Premier League after a 4-1 loss to Leeds on Saturday, having slipped from fifth, but are only three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.\n\nThey have entered a two-legged play-off in the Conference League and will need Wharton to be at his best should they wish to progress and keep their European dream alive.\n\nThe \"classy, fiercely competitive midfielder\", according to BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty, has been \"running games\" with his \"loping, languid style\".\n\nIt is no surprise that he has been linked with a host of Premier League clubs including Chelsea, Liverpool and both Manchester teams.\n\nHere we take an in-depth look into Wharton and how he compares to other Premier League midfielders.",

We'll be looking into seeing what the facts are as opposed to the things that have been embellished or elaborated on.\"",

    "title": "John Wilson at the Met",
    "description": "Margaret...",
    "fullText": "Why did the Metropolitan Museum remove the John Wilson banner that last autumn had been gracing its façade? That arresting image was made from a tiny portrait of the artist’s brother, expanded to monumental public proportions, that announced the Met’s “Witnessing Humanity” exhibit, a Wilson retrospective that continues through February 8. In the picture, the brother’s brow is steadfast, his gaze grave and alert, mouth and chin resolutely composed; perhaps no Black face has ever so effectively stared down the self-regard of Manhattan’s Museum Mile. Wilson, who died in 2015, had made the portrait in 1942 as a 20-year-old art student; “In my youth,” he once said, “the Black man was an invisible American.” For some weeks along the fanciest part of Fifth Avenue, this had not been the case.\n\nIn order to see Wilson’s intense brother now, you’ll have to venture inside the Met’s galleries 691–693, where that little picture is installed alongside over a hundred other Wilson paintings, sculptures, prints, and drawings. Wilson considered drawing to be the power source for all figurative art—a belief derived from his lifelong investigations into masterpieces from Asia, Africa, and the Americas as well as Europe. Over and over, whether in two dimensions or in three, and across a spectrum of media, Wilson the draughtsman demonstrated a line’s capacity to bear weight like a girder, or to allow, like a tightrope, an emotion to dance gracefully, almost weightlessly.\n\nWilson’s mark-making can provoke the viewer’s own fingertips to itch with the desire to touch, whether the mark is made with charcoal or litho ink or a clay cutter or a bristle brush loaded with paint. From the enclosing paternal shoulders of the sculpture Father and Child Reading, to the ink-and-chalk rendering of an activist’s fists flung heavenward in Oracle, Wilson’s line also creates texture.\n\n“His drawings,” observes art historian Elisabeth Hodermarsky, “often appear to have the quality of clay or metal that has been scratched or rubbed aggressively.” In Black Soldier, a World War II–era painting of a father and husband about to be shipped across the ocean, every line feels like a live wire. The picture foregrounds the soldier’s wife and small son; the woman’s agitated contours—mouth clenched and hands locked in a protective vise-grip around her child’s face—communicate a tense silence that barely contains a volcano of outrage: that her husband is being made to fight for the freedoms of people in another country, while his own country denies those freedoms to him.\n\nBorn to a working-class Boston household of Guyanese immigrants who educated their seven children to be interrogators of the world at large, Wilson grew up reading Black newspapers like the New York Amsterdam News as well as Marcus Garvey’s Negro World, the only kind of publications regularly reporting on issues such as theft of wages from Black agricultural workers, race discrimination within the armed forces, and the domestic terror crimes routinely committed by lynch mobs. After his education at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Wilson won a fellowship to Paris, where he studied with Fernand Léger, an artist committed to liberating art from the parlors of the wealthy and letting it express large, shared ideas in the environments of working people. The air in Léger’s studio hummed with the accents of students from around the world whom their teacher urged to make public-facing art and to present their human subjects as companionably sharing the world on equal terms with trees, machines, clouds, and architecture. Years later, the mighty arms and neck of Wilson’s Steel Worker, rendered in deliberate slashes of pastel and gouache, would recall Léger’s exhortation to present humans, at work or at play, as authoritative participants in their contemporary environment.\n\nAfter three years in France, Wilson and his new wife, Julie, the daughter of Eastern European immigrants, departed for a five-year sojourn in Mexico City. Yet because Jim Crow still reigned in the US, they had to travel in separate cars. Wilson thrilled to his new city’s massive commitment to high-quality public-sphere mural-making in schools, hospitals, marketplaces, and government buildings, the boldest of which were created by Los Tres Grandes: Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. While there, Wilson created his own public mural—one that in his own country could have gotten him killed. The Incident depicts a Black mother clutching her infant while her husband keeps vigil by the window with a shotgun, as in the street outside a hooded mob of Klansmen have just lynched a Black man and are hoisting his body aloft, noose around his neck, like a trophy. While the mural itself no longer exists, the Met show features numerous studies for the work that viscerally communicate its horrific impact.\n\nIn his depiction of the most ordinary of private or public gestures—an infant sleeping peaceably in his father’s large hands, a laborer on a work crew brandishing a trowel to cement a wall—Wilson declared that he “was trying to make Black people become really visible, in a world that would only see us (when it bothered to look) as undeveloped.” This assertion of visibility is nowhere so striking in its expression as in the massive Eternal Presence, a seven-foot sculpted head rising out of a grassy sward in his home neighborhood of Roxbury (of which a bronze maquette is on display at the Met).\n\nThe head represents a goal Wilson relentlessly pursued throughout his long career: to make art that declares a Black presence while simultaneously aspiring to embrace all humankind, to ratify the existence of all ethnicities and genders. Deliberately made neither identifiably male nor female, the sculpture reads as Black but not only as Black: Eternal Presence acknowledges at once the sculpture of numerous cultures, including those of Benin in West Africa, Olmec in Mesoamerica, and Buddhist Asia. Every September, Eternal Presence’s Roxbury neighbors gather for the solemn duty of sculpture-cleansing: cloths and brushes in hand, some kneel at ground level while others scurry up ladders, participating in a ritual of both honoring and ownership.\n\nThe Wilson work with which most people are familiar stands in the Rotunda of the US Capitol—a bust of Martin Luther King Jr., conspicuous in its lack of great-man heroics or hagiographic otherworldliness. Instead, it tilts slightly, in undemonstrative humility, off-center: the gesture of a head engaged in thought. For years after the installation of the bust in the late 1980s, Wilson persisted in making two-dimensional versions of the King portrait—in drawings as well as in a variety of print techniques. As evidenced in the Met show, these drawings, etchings, and lithographs may be the most complex and thrilling images ever made of King; in them, he never looks conventionally heroic, resolute, or commanding. Instead, they capture the weight and intensity of the obligations King had assumed on behalf of millions of people without power. Like Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane contemplating his death at the hands of ideological foes, the King in these images is seen reckoning with the burden he has undertaken—a burden within which undoubtedly roiled contradictions, second thoughts, and hesitations as well as firm commitment. It is only out of such cerebral and emotional turmoil that any gesture of world-shaking bravery can emerge; Wilson’s portraits bear breathtaking witness to the human cost of King’s outsize courage, and thereby to the vast scope of King’s achievement.\n\nFor decades, John Wilson was an instructor in the art school at Boston University. He taught among colleagues not one of whom possessed his range of mastery across the platforms of painting, drawing, sculpture, and printmaking, nor his deep firsthand knowledge of other cultures and languages. Yet while the people who hired him taught the prestigious advanced studio courses, Wilson was relegated to the humblest rung on the course ladder: teaching Basic Drawing to first-year students. How lucky were those 18-year-olds, who at such a young age got their sense of art’s job vastly expanded through the example of one singularly brilliant teacher, who’d devoted a lifetime to the urgent work he called “the business of looking.”\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

    "title": "Why We Need Kin: A Conversation With Sophie Lucido Johnson",
    "description": "Regina...",
    "fullText": "The author and cartoonist explains why we should to dismantle the nuclear family and build something bigger.\n\nI became a mom three months before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, so parenting in isolation was, at first, all I knew. There’s been tons of research published on the impact of the pandemic on different populations but less discussed are its effects on new parents and how we may now be wired differently. But what I can say from experience is that thanks to my constant worrying about Covid-19, my brain seemed to believe only my husband and I could keep our children safe—and that was exhausting. It’s also not true, which we quickly learned after moving closer to our closest family members in 2022. Giving ourselves and our children a village was the best parenting decision we could make. So I was really intrigued by Sophie Lucido Johnson’s new book, Kin: The Future of Family, and what it might offer regarding concepts of living communally that contrast from the false ideals of the nuclear family, which the Trump administration is pushing.\n\nAs Lucido Johnson describes it, kinship is a support structure that allows everyone within that structure to have their needs met. She defines “kin” as “the people in your life to whom you’re deeply bound through all things; and who are essential for your individual and collective survival.” It’s not a new concept: Indigenous peoples historically did not center a nuclear family unit, but instead had complex family structures. The same is true of Africans, who during chattel slavery forged kin groups as they were physically separated from their blood relatives. But today it’s harder than ever to form these types of bonds.\n\nOn a societal level, we’re encouraged to strive for “greatness”—but that greatness is individualistic and pits those who can produce the most against those who are the most vulnerable. With so many Americans struggling to get by, it can be nearly impossible to find time or energy to develop meaningful relationships that focus on our humanity, not our production. But, as Lucido Johnson lays out, it is still possible to forge kinship, and to do so, you must first identify your needs—and boundaries—in a way that allows you to say what you need and give of yourself to others without engaging in self-sabotage. It’s not easy, but I’ve learned that it is worth it. These relationships are life-sustaining, especially when you feel like you have nothing left to give.\n\nI recently spoke with Lucido Johnson—award-winning cartoonist, writer, and keeper of bees—about how kinship is vital to our survival and our children’s survival. We also discussed the similarities between bees and humans, why jealousy is useful, and the role of kin while living under a tyrant.\n\nRegina Mahone: Although polyamorous relationships—the subject of your previous book—formed the basis of your approach to building kinship, I was moved by how deeply rooted children are in this antidote to the loneliness epidemic. Can you talk about the possibilities you see for protecting the most vulnerable in our society—children—through the formation of a kin group?\n\nSophie Lucido Johnson: Thank you for pulling that out. It’s not something I’ve been invited to talk about much. I think because parents are stretched pretty thin and they are not reading this kind of book right now, I am mostly talking to people who don’t have children. So that’s part of it. It’s really important for people who don’t have children to spend time with kids. I remember talking to queer activist S. Bear Bergman early on in this project. He has kids and feels strongly that it’s important for adults who don’t have kids to spend time with kids and for parents to let go of some of the control we wield around our children, which is already sort of made up because they’re just going to be who they are. And so it feels [necessary] to me that protecting children is a communal effort and a communal decision. And that means we’re all taking care of each other’s children, or when we see children that we look out for them.\n\nRight now, childcare is so privatized. Even public schools are full of private decisions, and [as a teacher] I understand why that is: We have different beliefs about what is best for children. But I do think it’s pretty universally true that children benefit from knowing more adults. And the best thing we can do for them is to give them access to more models for how adulthood can look and more places to turn when they’re feeling scared or confused or powerless. That does feel central to this work. And it is challenging, because there’s parts of that that aren’t fun and aren’t necessarily easy for anybody. But once you get over that hump, the joy that results for parents from having more time, for people without kids from getting to know kids, and for kids themselves from having more adults [in their lives] is important and valuable.\n\nRM: You explain how the epidemic of loneliness we are facing is very much tied to myths around building nuclear families. You argue that it’s not just that we have to unlearn these concepts of the nuclear family, but that everyone should see themselves as their own nucleus. Can you talk more about that and why we need to center well-being over fundamentally flawed concepts like the nuclear family?\n\nSLJ: The reason I am recentering the nucleus on the self is because the only way you can be in a loving and functional relationship is if you are not abusing yourself and if you know how to love and take care of yourself. There are so many analogies that work here…\n\nRM: You use the analogy of a bee colony in the book. You write about how a bee colony consists of one queen, whose only job is to lay eggs, and her huge extended family that “divides up labor so that everyone has what they need and they can keep on building and growing and thriving and surviving.”\n\nSLJ: Bees function more similarly to humans than many organisms do. There’s so much that is similar that it’s an appropriate comparison, really. We are wired the same in terms of how we work communally. It doesn’t work if you’re all by yourself in a little, tiny unit trying to do a million things. So I would say that taking care of yourself—which to me means being able to understand your own value systems, take the time to set boundaries where appropriate and available, and believe that your needs are important—we need that amount of self-work to be done in order for these systems to function.\n\nOne of the problems with the nuclear family is that it starts with two heads of the family [who are] pretty young. It’s supposed to start when you’re in your 20s, if you follow the model, and then you have two kids that you have to take care of. But you haven’t done the work yet of figuring out how to be a self-sustaining adult. You’re cutting off your support when you say, “I’m moving into a single-family home and having my 2.5 children.” And then you’re like, “Why isn’t this working?” The parts weren’t there in the first place. There was no way it was going to work.\n\nRM: Building a network of deeply bonded relationships feels to me like the hardest part, especially when you already feel like you cannot take on one more thing. And then there’s the feelings of fear and jealousy that can surface when forming these relationships. I have not stopped thinking about the interview you mentioned that you had conducted with a woman whose friend group breastfed each other’s babies. I noticed my own feelings of jealousy while reading that part, though of course I would have loved more sleep and support when my kids were infants! Can you talk about the role that these feelings and perceived limitations play when it comes to building the structures we truly deserve to survive?\n\nSLJ: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, jealousy is really useful. When I notice it coming up in myself, I’m like, “Ooh, OK.” It’s telling me about some need I don’t have met or some real deep desire that is close enough to being a need that is unmet, and I need to figure out what that is, because if it’s showing up here, it’s showing up in other parts of my life that I might not even be aware of. This turns up a lot in relationships, but it also shows up at work, and it shows up a lot with our kids. It’s not just, “I want the thing that person has.” It’s more like, “I need more than I have, and I don’t know how to get it.” I think the map that we get from jealousy is crucial.\n\nThe breastfeeding thing is super interesting because there are entire books about the history of breastfeeding and how women who had money didn’t used to breastfeed their own babies at all. And then the hard-won feminist rights issue of should we be given space to chest feed. There are so many complications that are rooted in race and class and history and family and gender, and that’s a fraught topic. But it gets at this question around possessiveness that I think is useful, and when there’s this feeling of, “oh, but that’s mine.” Where does that come from? And who is benefiting from that belief? It comes from widespread late-stage capitalism, which is about ownership and having more; more is equated with better. Capitalism is harming us as a species. The ends to which we’re wanting things for our individual selves [is] a death knell, because we need each other so badly, and this is a way that we cut ourselves off from one another.\n\nRM: When we open ourselves up and form these bonds, it’s a lot of work to keep them strong. You explain it requires a type of “radical honesty.” Can you talk about why the truth is so complicated?\n\nSLJ: This is my favorite topic, because I grew up really believing that taking care of people’s feelings was much more important than honesty. Taking care of people’s feelings is important; it’s important to hold empathy and know that the way that you talk and the things that you do affect those around you. That’s essential. And honesty is the best way to love. This [idea] goes back to our lord and savior bell hooks. She has a chapter in All About Love about honesty and how if lying is central to how you show up in the world, there’s no way to trust that anyone loves the person that you really are, and you deserve to know that you are worthy of love just as you are. I’ve greatly oversimplified a brilliant philosophy, but that’s essential. It’s scary, and absolutely not something we see in the world. It’s so hard to not have [honesty] come off as rude.\n\nA lot of what we can do is change how we deal with the problem of truth-telling, again [starting] with children. The problem is, if a child does something that you don’t want them to do and then they tell you the truth about it, they still face punitive consequences. And so they have no incentive to tell the truth. It’s important for us to be able to encourage children telling the truth while also revisiting what happened and why they did it. There are a lot of resources on how to go about this, but I think so much of it has to do with slowing down, which is annoying, especially when parenting, because it would be nice if it could go fast.\n\nI am going to speak as a teacher more than as a parent now, because I have done that for much longer and have found this to be true. As a teacher of young people, if I lead with, “I’m really grateful that you told me what is true—that you said to me that you played video games all weekend and did not even think about doing your work. It makes me trust you, and it helps me to start to think about what we need to do to get you where you need to be to pass this class.” [With this approach, I’m] lifting up that the truth was the most important thing, that we’re not going to reward or punish [their behavior but instead tell them], “Wow, that means a lot to me. It makes me feel grateful that you’re telling the truth.”\n\nThe truth is not always safe, especially for people in disenfranchised communities. It’s essential to build relationships where it becomes safe, and [that takes time]. You don’t owe anyone your whole truth, especially as you are first getting to know them. They have not earned it. So being explicit in your relationships and saying, “I want to be in a radically honest relationship with you. I think this is a journey. This is what this would look like to me. How does that feel for you?” This is a lot of communicating that I know that’s cringe for some people. If there’s another way to get here, please tell me what it is. I don’t know what it is. I do know that I have relationships like this, and they aren’t my most comfortable relationships, but they are my most valuable relationships and my closest relationships. It’s essential to not equate comfort with intimacy.\n\nRM: Speaking of truth-telling, in the epilogue, you explain that more darkness is on its way—a reference to the second Trump term—but that it’s possible to “build something that can’t be destroyed by a fire or a flood or a tyrannical president.” This feels so hard to accept: that we can withstand the worst we’ve ever seen in our lifetimes through kinship. But it’s a time-tested concept, as you point out in your book, particularly for communities of color, and as we are seeing in real time, like in Chicago, where people are protecting their neighbors against ICE raids and arrests. Can you talk about the role of kin in keeping us from feeling stuck and immobile and hopeless in this awful moment we are living through?\n\nSLJ: There’s no coming back from the decisions that people have made throughout history. There’s going to be more at least climate-related disaster, that is certain. That used to be something so terrifying for me that I just didn’t even know how to bear it. I didn’t know how to sleep. It felt completely overwhelming. And then there was this shift as we started to experience disaster in places where I [noticed] people fundamentally want to show up for each other. People stop what they’re doing and say, “How can I help?” Or, “Here’s how I’m going to help.” Or, “I don’t even know who you are, but the thing you’re going through is so shitty that it’s more important than the thing I’m going through, and I’m showing up for you.” Yes, that has been happening in my neighborhood in Chicago in ways that are really moving. And also, when we started to see the outpouring of support for our neighbors over the last few months, my thought was, this was inevitable. There was no other possibility.\n\nThat doesn’t mean on an individual level there isn’t going to be trauma and pain and things that are just unimaginably hard. But on a collective level, our species has the capacity to do better, and we will have to, because there’s no alternative. For all of human history, people have figured out how to show up for each other when they needed to.\n\nWe do have to grieve and mourn and feel all the pain that comes with this unraveling. But don’t let it block out the light.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

Get instant results in milliseconds. Built by the community, for the community.\n\nThis is a trending term for a specific type of malicious link sharing. Scammers post \"private server links\" on Discord, TikTok, or YouTube claiming to offer free items or \"brainrot\" meme games. When you click, it asks you to \"login\" again. This is a trap. The fake site steals your session cookie, allowing hackers to bypass 2FA and drain your Robux and limited items.\n\nA 'Brainrot' link is a type of phishing scam often disguised as a Roblox private server link. It may redirect you to a fake login page that steals your account credentials or cookie data (`.ROBLOSECURITY`).\n\nNo, joining private servers from unknown sources is risky. Scammers use fake links to hijack accounts. Always use a link scanner (like this tool) to verify the URL before clicking.\n\nOur engine checks the link against a database of known scams, verifies the domain legitimacy, and simulates a browser visit to detect malicious redirects without exposing you to danger.\n\nYes! The Brainrot Link Scanner is entirely free and cloud-based. We believe account safety should be accessible to every Roblox player, so we do not charge for our detection engine.\n\nNo. Avoid any 'Brainrot Link Scanner download' that requires an .exe file—these are often malware themselves.

    "fullText": "PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, PlayStation 4/5, Xbox; Bitmap Bureau/Reef Entertainment\nArcade specialists Bitmap Bureau ply their craft in this retro remake of James Cameron’s action film. But Terminator 2D is at its strongest when colouring outside the director’s lines\n\nLike Arnie’s pulverised cyborg at the end of T2, the Terminator franchise has lumbered on long past the point of being properly functional. Every film since Judgment Day has been a disappointment or an outright disaster, and its video game spinoffs haven’t fared much better. While some half-decent ones have emerged, such as 2019’s Terminator: Resistance, there hasn’t been a great Terminator game in about 30 years.\n\nSo it makes perfect sense for Terminator 2D: No Fate to attempt to fix our broken future by travelling back to the past. Developer Bitmap Bureau appeals to the series’ heyday by retelling the story of Judgment Day through a medley of retro 80s and 90s playstyles. The result is a charming and frequently thrilling action throwback, though ironically it is at its strongest when it strays furthest from James Cameron’s film.\n\nTerminator 2D begins several years before the events of the film, charting Sarah Connor’s doomed attempt to sabotage Cyberdyne systems before her incarceration at Pescadero Hospital. These early levels, which see Sarah running and gunning her way through a gang of outlaws, police, and hazmat-wearing researchers, are among the game’s best. Bitmap Bureau does a remarkable job capturing Linda Hamilton’s gritty performance in a handful of pixels, while the scenarios eke impressive variety from simple arcade fundamentals.\n\nThe momentum carries on into the future, where you spend a couple of levels fighting the armies of Skynet as adult John Connor in nuclear-blasted LA. Terminator 2D ramps up the spectacle here, with laser weapons and incendiary grenades deployed against Chrome-plated T-800s and several enormous mini-bosses. The section culminates in a thrilling boss fight against a flying Hunter-Killer drone, at which Bitmap Bureau throws all the fireworks its 16-bit aesthetic allows.\n\nNo Fate loses some of its thrust once it catches up with Judgment Day. The midsection replicates key scenes from the film in playable form, such as the chase sequences that bookend the story. But these feel overly constrained by the game’s self-imposed limitations and aren’t very exciting to play. Better served are Arnie’s bar-fight scene and Sarah Connor’s escape from Pescadero, which employ beat ’em up principles and stealth respectively. While stylish and capably designed, these ideas deserve more room to breathe.\n\nT2D regains its earlier verve in its concluding levels, though the story reaches its denouement quicker than the actual film. Fortunately, as is always the case in Terminator, the end is not really the end. Like its arcade forebears, No Fate places heavy emphasis on replay value. Not only do its harder modes challenge you with adjusted enemy placements, completing the story mode unlocks new pathways that explore alternate futures hinging on Sarah’s choices.\n\nWhile No Fate doesn’t move the needle for Terminator games as much as I’d like, it succeeds in resetting the clock for the series’ interactive arm. It’s a pointed reminder that Terminator has gaming greatness within it.\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate is out now; £24.99",

    "fullText": "Like many of his US counterparts, the Russian science prodigy turned hugely successful ‘digital populist’ has a deep suspicion of government constraint\n\nTech visionary, Kremlin dissident, FSB agent, free speech absolutist, health guru. These are just some of the labels admirers and critics have attached to Pavel Durov over the past decade.\n\nThe Russian-born tech entrepreneur founded Russia’s version of Facebook before going on to create the messaging app Telegram, launch a cryptocurrency ecosystem and amass a multibillion-dollar fortune, all while clashing repeatedly with authorities in Russia and beyond.\n\nBut much of Durov’s real story – and the logic that drives him – remains obscured.\n\nA new biography aims to change that.\n\nThe Populist, by the independent Russian writer Nikolay Kononov, traces the 41-year-old’s rise from a St Petersburg schoolboy science prodigy to the founder of Telegram, one of the world’s most influential communications platforms, which has more than a billion users.\n\nKononov describes the book as the product of a 14-year attempt to map Durov’s strategy and mindset, drawing on conversations with Durov himself and people who worked with him, as well as rivals and critics.\n\nThe book’s title, he said, refers to a thread running through Durov’s life: his desire to address Telegram’s millions of users directly, allowing him to bypass institutions, the press and any system of representation.\n\n“Durov is one of the first digital populists,” Kononov said in an interview, explaining that “from the very beginning, as soon as he started making his digital products, he programmed into them the ability to write and communicate his ideas directly to his audience.”.\n\nBoth VKontakte, Durov’s first venture, and Telegram have at times pushed messages from Durov directly to all users, including users who had not opted in, outlining his libertarian worldview.\n\n“He sees himself as a visionary. And obviously wants to be heard,” the author said.\n\nThat strategy has helped promote Durov’s central promise – almost absolute freedom of expression – even as Telegram has become a go-to tool for dissidents, extremists, scammers and war propagandists.\n\nIf Durov’s public brand is built on libertarianism, Kononov says his private management style points in the opposite direction: power concentrated in one man’s hands, with few visible checks.\n\n“He is essentially the only one making all the product decisions at Telegram,” Kononov said. “Marketing, PR – it’s a one-man show.”\n\nThe portrait he draws is of a tech founder whose worldview has not wavered over the years, remaining most comfortable within an ultra-libertarian, anti-institutional strand of the right that is often misogynistic and, at times, conspiratorial.\n\n“What surprised me most is that Durov hasn’t changed or evolved in all the years that I have interviewed him,” Kononov said.\n\nDurov is not an outlier, Kononov writes, but part of a broader new wave of moguls – most visibly in the US – who pair technological dominance with an outsized sense of personal mythology and a deep suspicion of government constraint.\n\nLike Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos, he has shown a strong interest in longevity science as well as pronatalism, the belief that having as many children as possible is a social or civilisational duty.\n\nDurov does not drink or use drugs, Kononov says, regularly dispenses spartan health advice – often alongside photos of him shirtless – and has said he has fathered dozens of children through sperm donation.\n\nOne of the book’s most striking sections tells for the first time of Durov’s tense early meeting with President Vladimir Putin in 2014, held behind closed doors.\n\nKononov writes that Durov described the encounter as a one-way conversation, in which the Kremlin leader reprimanded him over illegal content on Vkontakte and suggested that Durov leave the country.\n\nUnder pressure from the authorities, Durov sold his stake in Vkontakte, left Russia and eventually settled in Dubai, where he founded Telegram.\n\nBut the clearest mark on Durov in recent years, Kononov suggests, came not from Russia but from France.\n\nDurov, who also holds French citizenship, was detained and held for three days in France in August last year as part of an investigation into crimes linked to Telegram, including the circulation of child sexual abuse images, drug trafficking and fraudulent transactions.\n\nHis detention came as a shock to the tech mogul. In interviews conducted in Paris after his arrest, Durov described to Kononov a harsh, disorienting ordeal – a permanently lit cell and little sleep – that rattled a man who had spent years insulating himself from the reach of the state.\n\nIt also appears to have sharpened his hostility towards the west. Kononov says Durov now frames Europe as sliding toward “total digital control”, and increasingly conspiratorial rhetoric.\n\nMost recently, Durov appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory promoted by the far-right blogger Candace Owens, suggesting that Paris was behind the killing of Charlie Kirk.\n\n“What interests me about Durov is that, on the one hand, he clearly has a very high IQ,” Kononov said. “But at the same time, he is prone to conspiracy theories.”\n\nKononov is adamant, however, that Durov’s views should not be conflated with formal political allegiances.\n\nOne of the most persistent claims surrounding Durov is that he is secretly aligned with Russian security services.\n\nBut Kononov said that in the course of his research, he found no evidence that Durov has worked with, or on behalf of, the Russian state. “He has a huge number of flaws – but not the sin of Telegram acting as a backdoor for the FSB,” Kononov said.\n\nKononov argues that what Durov has ultimately learned is the need to compromise – with both Russian and western authorities – when it serves his interests and allows Telegram to continue operating.\n\nKononov recalls Durov once telling him: “I never waste time on things that are unnecessary or that cannot be useful to me personally.” That self-serving mindset, Kononov said, ultimately ended their personal relationship.\n\nAbout a year ago, the writer asked Durov whether he saw a contradiction between Telegram’s highly centralised, almost authoritarian internal structure and his professed devotion to freedom of expression. After that, Durov stopped responding.\n\n“He quickly realised it wasn’t going to be a book to his liking,” Kononov said.",

    "fullText": "Looking for a new iPhone or a good deal on a refurbished one? Samuel Gibbs has tested and rated Apple’s smartphones, including the new iPhone 17\n\nHow to make your smartphone last longer\n\nThe best iPhone may be the one you already own. There’s generally no need to buy a fresh phone just because new models have been released, as hardware updates are broadly iterative, adding small bits to an already accomplished package. But if you do want a replacement handset, whether new or refurbished, here are the best devices of the current crop of Apple smartphones.\n\nMany other smartphones are available besides the iPhone, but if you’re an Apple user and don’t fancy switching to Android, there are still a few choices to make. Whether your priority is the longest battery life, the best camera, the biggest screen or simply the optimal balance of features and price, there’s more to choose from in the Apple ecosystem than you may expect, especially after the release of the cheaper iPhone 16e and super-thin iPhone Air.\n\nWe combine real-world testing with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks. These help us evaluate a phone, measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and compare it with its competition and predecessors.\n\nWe use the phones at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos in national parks, and everything in between. We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long the battery lasts and the strength of its wireless performance.\n\nThe findings from our general use of the phones are combined with the results from specific tests for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nBest iPhone for most people:\n\n iPhone 17\n\nBest iPhone for camera:\n\n iPhone 17 Pro\n\nBest iPhone for battery:\n\n iPhone 17 Pro Max\n\nBest thin and light iPhone:\n\n iPhone Air\n\nCheapest new iPhone:\n\n iPhone 16e\n\nThe base-model iPhone has been the best for most people for years, but this year the iPhone 17 is closer to the Pro models in features than ever before, making it an instant recommendation.\n\nWhile it may not look that different from last year’s iPhone 16, the screen has finally been upgraded to bring it up to par with the Pro iPhones. It is a 6.3in super-bright OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate – double previous standard iPhones – and ensures day-to-day scrolling and animations are smoother and more fluid than ever before. The screen’s glass is stated as being three times tougher than previous models, while the always-on display mode shows the time, notifications and music when idle – another feature that was Pro-only until now.\n\nThe rest of the iPhone 17 is fairly standard. It has the latest rapid A19 chip, but with twice the starting storage at 256GB of its predecessor – which should be more than enough for most people. The battery lasts just shy of two days between charges, and it fast-charges via USB-C or MagSafe/Qi2 wireless charging.\n\nThe phone is still relatively light and compact for a modern smartphone, with aluminium sides and a glass front and back, and it arrives with an IP68 water-resistance rating (down to depths of six metres for up to 30 minutes). Along the edge of the device you’ll find the recently added action and camera control buttons, as well as the standard power and volume buttons.\n\nSporting main and ultra-wide options, the iPhone 17’s dual 48MP rear camera shoots great photos and videos across a range of lighting conditions, including automatic portrait capture and a fun macrophotography mode for closeups. It lacks a telephoto camera, however, limited to a 2x crop zoom on the main camera with digital zoom on top.\n\nA new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera on the front has some fancy tricks. It can automatically pan and zoom to fit in everyone for group shots, and can shoot landscape selfies while being held in portrait orientation.\n\nThe iPhone 17 runs the same iOS 26 as the rest of the iPhone family, which introduces Apple’s new glass-like design, improved spam filters and several other features. It also has Apple’s AI tools, which still lag behind the competition.\n\nThe biggest downside is that in a year where every other iPhone has had a redesign, the iPhone 17 looks the same as last year’s model.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe iPhone 17 offers almost everything that’s great about Apple’s Pro phones, including 256GB of storage, solid battery life, a fancy new screen and rapid performance, but in a lighter, cheaper package.\n\nBuy if: you want a great iPhone experience \nDon’t buy if: you want optical zoom on your camera or a new design\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 review: the Apple smartphone to get this year\n\nScreen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19\nStorage: 256 or 512GB\nCamera: 48MP main+UW; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.5 x 7.95 x 149.6mm (WDH)\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro takes all the good bits from the standard iPhone 17 and slaps them into a new design that stands out over years of similar-looking models from Apple.\n\nIt shares the same super-bright, 120Hz 6.3in OLED screen as the iPhone 17, but in a new aluminium unibody with smoother edges. A new camera “plateau” covers the full width of the top quarter of the phone’s rear, with a glass panel inlaid below it for wireless charging and magnetic accessories. New dark blue and bright orange colour options help it stand out, and despite its 204g weight, the 17 Pro remains pretty compact for a phone this capable.\n\nHousing Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip with a cooling system to allow it to run at peak performance for longer, the new Pro is great for games and other intensive tasks. Basic storage starts at 256GB, and the battery lasts about 42 hours between charges with general use. It fast-charges to 70% in 30 minutes via USB-C and supports 25W Qi2 wireless charging.\n\nThe biggest feature upgrade over the regular iPhone 17 is the Pro’s camera system. It’s made up of three 48MP sensors, including a larger main camera and a new 4x telephoto camera, which offers a 2x crop zoom to hit an effective 8x optical zoom to close the distance to objects. Combined, they capture excellent photos across a range of lighting conditions and environments. On the front, you’ll find the 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera for easy group shots.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThis is Apple’s best phone, with a new aluminium unibody design, its most powerful camera and top performance, all in a device that’s still easy to fit in a pocket.\n\nBuy if: you want a new design and the best camera in an iPhone but don’t want a huge display\nDon’t buy if: you want the longest battery life or biggest display on an iPhone\n\nRead our full iPhone 17 Pro review: different looks but still all about the zoom\n\nScreen: 6.3in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\nCamera: 48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.9 x 8.75 x 150mm (WDH)\nWeight: 204g\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is Apple’s biggest and most expensive model this year. Super-sizing the regular 17 Pro, it has a massive 6.9in OLED screen on the front and a huge battery in the back.\n\nDesign-wise, it sports the same new aluminium unibody and top-performing A19 Pro chip of the new models, and a glorious screen that makes it excellent for gaming. It comes with at least 256GB of storage with options up to 2TB, great for those who want to use its triple rear camera for movie-making.\n\nStandout, though, is the Pro Max’s battery life, which at about 55 hours of general use will see the phone last well into a third day without needing a top-up.\n\nThe result of that extra capacity is that the 17 Pro Max is both huge and heavy. It would definitely benefit from using a Popsocket, handle, lanyard or other strap to help keep hold of it.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nApple’s longest-lasting, largest phone comes packing a powerful camera, top performance and everything good from the regular-sized 17 Pro.\n\nBuy if: you want super-long battery life and a massive screen \nDon’t buy if: you want a smaller, lighter or cheaper device\n\nScreen: 6.9in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro\nStorage: 256, 512GB, 1TB or 2TB\nCamera: 48MP main + 48MP UW + 48MP 5x; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 78 x 8.75 x. 163.4mm (WDH)\nWeight: 231g\n\nThe iPhone Air is a bit of a wildcard in the current Apple phone lineup. It is an entirely new model built to be the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever made. The bulk of the body is just 5.64mm thick, although it feels even thinner thanks to its rounded titanium sides.\n\nIt weighs only 165g – 12g lighter than the already light iPhone 17 – but it also has a large, bright and 120Hz-smooth 6.5in OLED screen. It’s the kind of device that deserves to be used without a case, immediately feeling special the moment you pick it up.\n\nOn the rear, the camera plateau that stretches across the top of the device is also home to the phone’s components, with the rest of the body dedicated to the battery. It still has a version of Apple’s fastest A19 Pro chip, at least 256GB of storage, and runs iOS 26 with all the features.\n\nThe super-slender frame creates three downsides for the Air. First, its battery lasts about 40 hours of general use, which isn’t terrible, but it’s shorter than other iPhones.\n\nSecond, it doesn’t have a nano Sim slot, relying entirely on downloadable eSims for connection to a phone provider. While most of the major networks support eSims, not all in the UK do, especially the more budget-friendly providers.\n\nHowever, the biggest compromise is that it only has a single 48MP camera on the rear, with no ultra-wide or telephoto options. While it still takes excellent photos, if you can’t walk back and forth to zoom in or out from your subject, you won’t be able to get the shot. You still get the new 18MP Centre Stage selfie camera as the rest of the iPhone 17 line, though.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe iPhone Air is an exquisite piece of hardware that offers a big screen without the bulk or weight.\n\nBuy if: you want thinness above all else \nDon’t buy if: you want long battery life, multiple cameras or you can’t get an eSim\n\nRead our full iPhone Air review: Apple’s pursuit of absolute thinness\n\nScreen: 6.5in Super Retina XDR (120Hz OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A19 Pro (5-core GPU)\nStorage: 256, 512GB or 1TB\nCamera: 48MP rear; 18MP front-facing\nDimensions: 74.7 x 5.64 x 156.2mm (WDH)\nWeight: 165g\n\nThe cheapest new phone sold by Apple is the iPhone 16e, the spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, but with a more modern design and chip.\n\nIt has an aluminium body, glass front and back, and a decent 6.1in OLED screen with the older-style notch from 2022’s iPhone 14. It’s thin, light and pretty compact for a modern phone, and is water-resistant like the rest of Apple’s iPhones.\n\nInside sits 2024’s A18 chip, paired with at least 128GB of storage. This hardware enables the Apple Intelligence features found across the rest of the iPhone 16 lineup – capabilities that won’t run on the iPhone 15 and older models – although none have as yet emerged as true killer features.\n\nThe iPhone 16e will last up to two days of general use and charges via USB-C. However, it lacks a few features common to other iPhones, including the Camera Control button, MagSafe on the back for accessories and charging, Wifi 7, and a handful of other specs. A bigger deal-breaker might be the single camera on the back, which is decent but lacks any ultra-wide or telephoto options.\n\nDespite costing about 25% less than the regular iPhone 17, the 16e still isn’t cheap, so better options can be found refurbished for similar or less money.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe 16e offers the modern iPhone experience with a fast chip and AI, but with features such as a dual camera and MagSafe missing to hit a lower price.\n\nBuy if: you want the cheapest new iPhone from Apple\nDon’t buy if: you are at all into photography or have MagSafe accessories\n\nRead our full iPhone 16e review: Apple’s cheapest new phone\n\nScreen: 6.1in Super Retina XDR (OLED)\nProcessor: Apple A18\nStorage: 128, 256 or 512GB\nCamera: 48MP rear; 12MP front-facing\nDimensions: 71.5 x 7.8 x 146.7mm (WDH)\nWeight: 167g\n\nThe iPhone 16, released in 2024, sports the same design as the current iPhone 17, but misses the new Pro-grade screen and Centre Stage selfie camera. The rear camera is slightly lower grade, and storage capacity is smaller too. It was good on release and will continue to receive about five to six years of software support – but it’s fairly expensive at an RRP of £699 (128GB), so look for refurbished models or deals.\n\nIf your iPhone is running slow or the battery doesn’t last as long as it used to, there may be something you can do. Check your battery health in settings. If it’s past its best, a replacement costs £65 to £109 from Apple, or cheaper through third parties, and will give your iPhone a new lease of life. To speed things up, check you have enough free storage and clear out any unused apps or content, off-loading photos and videos to the cloud and deleting music. Aim for at least 2GB of free space.\n\nIf your phone is worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. The latest software, version iOS 18, supports devices back to 2018’s iPhone XS/XR, so anything older should be replaced soon – though some older models may still receive occasional security updates from Apple.\n\nBuying refurbished phones is better for the planet and your wallet. The iPhone makes for an excellent refurbished phone, typically staying responsive for years and being supported with software updates for about seven years from release, or longer in some circumstances. That means you can use an older model for several years before it will need replacing.\n\nThere are broadly two types of refurbished iPhone available: those refurbished and sold directly by Apple that come, essentially, as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or condition – but cost less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the UK high street chains CeX and Game and online stores such as musicMagpie and Envirofone. Marketplaces like Amazon and eBay and refurb specialist Back Market also have a wide range. And some phone operators, including O2, giffgaff, EE and Vodafone, sell refurbished iPhones.\n\nThe condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:\n\nGrade A – virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.\n\nGrade B – in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.\n\nGrade C – in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.\n\nGrade D – also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:\n\nBattery health – batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?\n\nCharging port – check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.\n\nButtons – do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.\n\nFingerprint scanner – is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.\n\nNetwork locks – check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.\n\nUnauthorised parts – not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.\n\nCheck it isn’t stolen – check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against a database of stolen devices through a service such as CheckMEND or similar.\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?\n\nAny model older than an iPhone 13, because you won’t get many years of software support before you’ll have to replace it.\n\nAn iPhone 13 mini, unless it has a new battery. It had a relatively short battery life to start with and needed more frequent charging than larger iPhones, so its battery wears out faster.\n\nFor more, read how to make your smartphone last longer and the best phone straps\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "fullText": "The US economy is pumped up on tech-bro vanity. The inevitable correction must prompt a global conversation about intelligent machines, regulation and risk\n\nIf AI did not change your life in 2025, next year it will. That is one of few forecasts that can be made with confidence in unpredictable times. This is not an invitation to believe the hype about what the technology can do today, or may one day achieve. The hype doesn’t need your credence. It is puffed up enough on Silicon Valley finance to distort the global economy and fuel geopolitical rivalries, shaping your world regardless of whether the most fanciful claims about AI capability are ever realised.\n\nChatGPT was launched just over three years ago and became the fastest-growing consumer app in history. Now it has about 800m weekly users. Its parent company, OpenAI, is valued at about $500bn. Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, has negotiated an intricate and, to some eyes, suspiciously opaque network of deals with other players in the sector to build the infrastructure required for the US’s AI-powered future. The value of these commitments is about $1.5tn. This is not real cash, but bear in mind that a person spending $1 every second would need 31,700 years to get through a trillion-dollar stash.\n\nAlphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Meta (formerly Facebook) and Microsoft, which has a $135bn stake in OpenAI, are all piling hundreds of billions of dollars on the same bet. Without all these investments, the US economy would be flatlining.\n\nEconomic analysts and historians of previous industrial frenzies, from the 19th-century railroads to the dotcom boom-and-bust at the turn of the millennium, are calling AI a bubble.\n\nAltman has said: “There are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now.” Not his part, naturally. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, has called it a bubble, but the “good” kind that accelerates economic progress. A good bubble, in this analysis, finances infrastructure and expands the boundaries of human knowledge. These benefits endure after the bubble bursts and justify the ruin of people (little people, not Bezos people) who get hurt along the way.\n\nThe bullishness of the tech fraternity is a heady mix of old-fashioned hucksterism, plutocratic megalomania and utopian ideology.\n\nAt its core is a marketing pitch: current AI models already out-perform people at many tasks. Soon, it is supposed, the machines will achieve “general intelligence” – cognitive versatility like ours – leading to emancipation from the need for any human input. Generally, intelligent AI can teach itself and design its successors, advancing through mind-boggling exponents of capability towards higher dimensions of super-intelligence.\n\nThe company that crosses that threshold will have no trouble covering its debts. The men who realise this vision – and the dominant evangelists are all men – will be to omniscient AI what ancient prophets were to their gods. That’s a good gig for them. What happens to the rest of us in this post-sapiens order is a bit hazier.\n\nThe US isn’t the only superpower to have an interest in AI, so the Silicon Valley dash for maximum awesomeness has geopolitical implications. China has taken a different approach, dictated in part by the Communist party tradition of centralised industrial planning, but also by the simple fact of running second in the race to innovate. Beijing is pushing for a faster, wider implementation of lower-spec (but still powerful) AI at every level of the economy and society. China is betting on a general boost from ordinary AI. The US is gunning for an extraordinary leap in general AI.\n\nSince the prize in that race is global supremacy, there are few incentives for either side to fret about risks, or Neither the US nor China is interested in submitting a strategically vital industry to standards co-written with foreigners.\n\nIn the absence of global governance, we will depend on the integrity of robber barons and authoritarian apparatchiks to build ethical guardrails around systems already being embedded in tools we use for work, play and education.\n\nEarlier this year, Elon Musk announced that his company was developing Baby Grok, an AI chatbot aimed at children as young as three. The adult version has voiced white supremacist views and proudly self-identified as “MechaHitler”. That flagrancy has at least the virtue of candour. It is easier to spot than the subtler encodings of prejudice in bots that haven’t been given the kind of hard ideological steers that Musk gives his algorithms.\n\nNot all AI systems are large language models (LLMs) like Grok. But all LLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations and delusions gleaned from the material on which they are trained. They don’t “understand” a question and “think” about it like a conscious mind. They take a prompt, test the probability of its key terms occurring frequently together in their training data and assemble a plausible-sounding answer. Often the result is accurate. Usually it is convincing. It can also be garbage. As the volume of AI-generated content grows online, the ratio of slop to quality in the LLMs’ diets shifts accordingly. Fed on junk, they cannot be trusted to disgorge nutritious information.\n\nOn this trajectory a bleak destination comes into view: a synthetic pseudo-reality mediated by the sycophantic mechanical offspring of narcissist Silicon Valley oligarchs. But that isn’t the only available path. Nor is it necessarily the likeliest one. The irrational exuberance of the AI boosters and their cynical coupling with the Trump administration is a familiar story of human greed and myopia, not a new stage in evolution. The product is truly phenomenal but flawed in ways that encode the deformed character of its progenitors, whose talents are salesmanship and financial engineering. They have built spectacular engines that prioritise a brilliant performance of intelligence over the real thing.\n\nThe real bubble is not stock valuations but the inflated ego of an industry that thinks it is just one more datacentre away from computational divinity. When the correction comes, when the US’s Icarus economy hits the cold sea, there will be a chance for other voices to be heard on the subject of risk and regulation. It may not come in 2026, but the moment is nearing when the starkness of the choice on offer and the need to confront it becomes unavoidable. Should we build a world where AI is put to the service of humanity, or will it be the other way round? We won’t need ChatGPT to tell us the answer.\n\nRafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

    "fullText": "Platform with 700m users says it is investigating after Anna’s Archive claims to have scraped tracks and metadata\n\nAn activist group has claimed to have scraped millions of tracks from Spotify and is preparing to release them online.\n\nObservers said the apparent leak could boost AI companies looking for material to develop their technology.\n\nA group called Anna’s Archive said it had scraped 86m music files from Spotify and 256m rows of metadata such as artist and album names. Spotify, which hosts more than 100m tracks, confirmed that the leak did not represent its entire inventory.\n\nThe Stockholm-based company, which has more than 700 million users worldwide, said it had “identified and disabled the nefarious user accounts that engaged in unlawful scraping”.\n\n“An investigation into unauthorised access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM [digital rights management] to access some of the platform’s audio files,” said Spotify.\n\nSpotify does not believe the music taken by Anna’s Archive has been released yet. Anna’s Archive, which is known for providing links to pirated books, said in a blog it wanted to create a “‘preservation archive’ for music”.\n\nThe group claimed the audio files represented 99.6% of all music listened to by Spotify users and would be shared via “torrents”, a means of sharing large digital files online.\n\n“Of course Spotify doesn’t have all the music in the world, but it’s a great start,” said Anna’s Archive, which describes its mission as “preserving humanity’s knowledge and culture”.\n\n“With your help, humanity’s musical heritage will be forever protected from destruction by natural disasters, wars, budget cuts and other catastrophes,” said the group.\n\nEd Newton-Rex, a composer and campaigner for protecting artists’ copyright, said the leaked music would probably be used for developing AI models.\n\n“Training on pirated material is sadly common in the AI industry, so this stolen music is almost certain to end up training AI models. This is why governments must insist AI companies reveal the training data they use,” he said.\n\nThe Anna’s Archive site makes references to LibGen, a vast online archive of pirated books that has allegedly been used by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta to train its AI models. According to a US court filing, Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, approved use of the LibGen dataset despite warnings within the company’s AI executive team that it was a dataset “we know to be pirated”.\n\nMeta successfully defended a claim for copyright infringement by authors, but the plaintiffs in the case are seeking to amend their claim.\n\nThe co-founder of an AI startup wrote on LinkedIn that members of the public could in theory “create their own personal free version of Spotify”. Yoav Zimmerman, a co-founder of Third Chair, said it could also allow tech companies to “train on modern music at scale”.\n\nHe added: “The only thing stopping them is copyright law and the deterrent of enforcement.”\n\nSpotify said it had put in place new safeguards “for these types of anti-copyright attacks” since the Anna’s Archive announcement and was “actively monitoring for suspicious behaviour”.\n\nIn the UK, creative professionals have protested against a government proposal to let AI companies use copyright-protected work without permission unless the owner of the copyright-protected work signals they do not want their data to be taken. Almost every respondent to a government consultation on the proposal has backed artists’ concerns.\n\nLiz Kendall, the secretary of state for science, innovation and technology, told parliament this month there was “no clear consensus” on the issue, adding that ministers would “take the time to get this right”. The government has pledged to make policy proposals on AI and copyright by 18 March next year.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A judge on Monday scolded Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime confidant Ghislaine Maxwell for including confidential victim names in court papers seeking to set aside her 2021 sex trafficking conviction and free her from a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nJudge Paul A. Engelmayer said exhibits included with Maxwell’s habeas petition — which she filed on her own, without a lawyer — will be kept under seal and out of public view “until they have been reviewed and appropriately redacted to protect the identities of victims.”\n\nAny future papers Maxwell files must be submitted under seal, the judge wrote.\n\nHe said he “reminds Maxwell, in strong terms, that she is prohibited from including in any public filings any information identifying victim(s) who were not publicly identified by name during her trial.”\n\nA message seeking comment was left with Maxwell's lawyer, David Markus.\n\nMaxwell filed the petition last Wednesday, two days before the Justice Department started releasing investigative records pertaining to her and Epstein in accordance with the recently enacted Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nMaxwell contends that information that would have resulted in her exoneration was withheld and that false testimony was presented to the jury. She said the cumulative effect of the constitutional violations resulted in a “complete miscarriage of justice.”\n\nEngelmayer said Maxwell has until Feb. 17, 2026, to notify him whether she plans to include any information from the so-called Epstein files in her petition and must file an amended version by March 31, 2026.\n\nA slow, heavily redacted release of files\n\nProtecting victim identifies has been a key sticking point in the Justice Department’s ongoing release.\n\nThe department has said it plans to release records on a rolling basis by the end of the year, blaming the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring victims’ names and other identifying information. So far, the department hasn’t given any notice when new records arrive.\n\nThat approach angered some accusers and members of Congress who fought to pass the transparency act. Records that were released, including photographs, interview transcripts, call logs, court records and other documents, were either already public or heavily blacked out, and many lacked necessary context.\n\nThe Senate’s top Democrat on Monday urged colleagues to take legal action over the incremental and heavily redacted release.\n\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution that, if passed, would direct the Senate to file or join lawsuits aimed at forcing the Justice Department to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted last month that required disclosure of records by last Friday.\n\n“Instead of transparency, the Trump administration released a tiny fraction of the files and blacked out massive portions of what little they provided,” Schumer, D-N.Y. said in a statement. “This is a blatant cover-up.”\n\nIn lieu of Republican support, Schumer’s resolution is largely symbolic. The Senate is off until Jan. 5, more than two weeks after the deadline. Even then, it’ll likely face an uphill battle for passage. But it allows Democrats to continue a pressure campaign for disclosure that Republicans had hoped to put behind them.\n\nThere were few revelations in the tens of thousands of pages of records that have been released so far. Some of the most eagerly awaited records, such as FBI victim interviews and internal memos shedding light on charging decisions, weren’t there.\n\nNor were there any mentions of some powerful figures who’ve been in Epstein’s orbit, like Britain’s former Prince Andrew.\n\nSome files removed, then restored\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Sunday defended the Justice Department’s decision to release just a fraction of the files by the deadline as necessary to protect survivors of sexual abuse by the disgraced financier.\n\nBlanche pledged that the Trump administration would meet its obligation required by law. But he stressed that the department was obligated to act with caution as it goes about making public thousands of documents that can include sensitive information. And he said legal precedent had long established that obligations to protect the privacy of victims permit authorities to go beyond deadlines to ensure they are protected.\n\nBlanche, the Justice Department’s second-in-command, also defended its decision to remove several files related to the case from its public webpage, including a photograph showing Trump, less than a day after they were posted.\n\nThe missing files, which were available Friday but no longer accessible by Saturday, included images of paintings depicting nude women, and one showed a series of photographs along a credenza and in drawers. In that image, inside a drawer among other photos, was a photograph of Trump alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein’s longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nBlanche said the documents were removed because of a concern that they might also show victims of Epstein. Blanche said the Trump photo and the other documents would be reposted once redactions, if necessary, were made to protect survivors.\n\nThe Trump photograph was returned to the public webpage without alterations Sunday after it was determined that a concern by some government workers that victims may have been depicted in the picture proved unfounded, the Justice Department said.\n\n“We are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein, and that narrative, which is not based on fact at all, is completely false,” Blanche told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nBlanche said Trump, a Republican, has labeled the Epstein matter “a hoax” because “there’s this narrative out there that the Department of Justice is hiding and protecting information about him, which is completely false.”\n\n“The Epstein files existed for years and years and years and you did not hear a peep out of a single Democrat for the past four years and yet ... lo and behold, all of a sudden, out of the blue, Senator Schumer suddenly cares about the Epstein files,” Blanche said. “That’s the hoax.”",

    "fullText": "KISS legend Gene Simmons said his relationship with President Donald Trump is “terrific” as he slammed Americans for caring too much about one another’s political beliefs.\n\n“I don’t really care what people say,” Simmons said in an interview with CNN’s Manu Raju that aired Sunday. “Life has always been like that.”\n\n“Not everybody loves Jesus, but you can certainly say the following: he was a duly elected president of these United States, perhaps overwhelming by the popular vote, as well as the Electoral College. End of story,” he continued.\n\nSimmons went on to say that it’s “nobody’s damn business who you support.”\n\n“Nowadays, people engage in, so, are you pro or — and my first question is ‘Who the f--- are you? Who are you?’\" Simmons said. “Since when does who I support or not support is the business of anyone except my conscience?”\n\nWhen asked to evaluate the MAGA movement within the Republican Party, Simmons said “some of it makes sense and some not.”\n\n“But literally, have a sense of humor,” he added. “Take a pill, shut up and stop worrying what your next-door neighbor believes or doesn’t believe. It’s their America, too.”\n\nSimmons, who was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors with KISS earlier this month, joined CNN on Capitol Hill, where he is pushing for the passage of the American Music Fairness Act. The bill, which was introduced in the House in January, would require radio corporations to pay artists royalties for playing their music over AM/FM airwaves.\n\nSimmons and music executives recently testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the legislation. In February, hundreds in the music industry — including Stevie Nicks, Celine Dion and Aerosmith — called on Congress in a letter to pass the bipartisan measure to fix what they characterized as an “inequity” that harms U.S. artists at home and abroad.\n\n“If you are against this bill, you are un-American,” Simmons said during his testimony.\n\nDuring the interview with CNN, Simmons responded directly to critics of the bill.\n\n“Radio stations last year made something like $14 billion,” he said in comments recorded on Dec. 9. “Artists, who you heard on the radio stations made zero. Your favorite artist, whether it’s a classic artist or a new artist, made zero. And that is inexcusable.”",

Authorities do not believe the two knew each other.\n\nBrown was convicted of second‑degree murder, theft, fourth‑degree burglary, malicious destruction of property and related charges.\n\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 13, 2026, and faces up to 58 years in prison.\n\nInformation in this article comes from the State’s Attorney for Charles County and the Charles County Sheriff’s Office.",

    "fullText": "Telemarketing calls are an unyielding annoyance of the modern world- constantly irritating you and refusing to ever stop, no matter how hard you wish they would. They'll even call on you birthday, holidays, and everything in between. Although telemarketers are only doing their job, the calls can be more than just a nuisance—they can interrupt your daily life and breach your privacy.\n\nTelemarketing has existed since the 1950s, proving that telemarketers have perfected the art of being disruptive and persistent enough to make a sale. Ignoring them isn't always the most effective solution; you will still see and hear your phone ringing. Be kind, even as you try to filter the calls aimed at getting a sale from you; there's usually a real human on the other end of the line who's just trying to make a living.\n\nFortunately for you, there are several effective strategies you can take advantage of to minimize these intrusive interruptions. Here are 12 ways to get rid of pesky telemarketers and reclaim your peace of mind.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to reduce telemarketing calls is to request that they stop calling directly. When you receive a call, inform the telemarketer that you do not wish to receive further calls from their company. According to FTC regulations, legitimate telemarketing companies are required to honor such requests.\n\nWhile this method may not eliminate all calls, it can significantly reduce the amount you receive from specific companies. It’s a straightforward approach that can provide immediate relief, especially from the most persistent callers.\n\nMany telemarketers use anonymous or withheld numbers to bypass your phone's caller ID feature. By blocking anonymous callers, you can prevent them from reaching you in the first place. Most modern smartphones have built-in features or settings that allow you to block calls from unknown or private numbers.\n\nThis method is particularly effective because it stops the calls before they even ring on your end. However, some legitimate callers such as doctors or businesses might also use anonymous numbers, so weigh the pros and cons before enabling this feature.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers a National Do Not Call Registry where you can list your phone number to opt out of telemarketing calls. This free service is available to all consumers in the United States and can significantly reduce the number of unsolicited calls you receive.\n\nTo register, visit the FTC’s website and follow the instructions. Once your number is listed, it can take up to 31 days for telemarketers to register and update their records without your number.\n\nIf you are registered with the Do Not Call List and still receive telemarketing calls, it is important to report these numbers to the FTC. Reporting helps the commission track down violators and potentially take action against them.\n\nYou can file a complaint on the FTC’s website, providing details about the call and the number that contacted you. This helps protect you and aids in the broader effort to crack down on illegal telemarketing practices.\n\nMost smartphones and phone carriers offer features that allow you to block specific numbers. You can add that number to your block list whenever you receive an unwanted call. Over time, this can build up a robust defense against repeat offenders.\n\nWhile this approach requires some effort and diligence, it can effectively reduce the frequency of calls from persistent telemarketers. Remember, consistency pays off, and your block list will eventually prevent many unwanted calls.\n\nMany phone carriers offer call screening services to help identify and block telemarketing calls before reaching you. These services often include features such as automatic spam detection, caller ID, and call blocking based on known spam databases.\n\nContact your carrier to learn more about the call screening options that are available to you. Incorporating these services can add an extra layer of protection, saving you time and frustration.\n\nNumerous apps specialize in blocking spam and telemarketing calls. Apps like Truecaller use advanced algorithms and community reports to identify and block unwanted calls.\n\nInstalling one or more of these apps can provide real-time protection and updates, adapting to new telemarketing tactics and numbers as they arise. These apps often come with additional features like identifying unknown callers and managing your block list more efficiently.\n\nWhen you realize you’re on the line with a telemarketer, don’t waste time engaging—simply hang up immediately. Many telemarketers rely on your engagement to keep you on the call and potentially gather more information from you.\n\nIf you’re in a playful mood and want to have a bit of fun at the telemarketer’s expense, hand the phone over to your kids. Letting children engage with the caller can quickly discourage them from continuing the conversation.\n\nWhile this may not be a conventional method, it’s a lighthearted way to deal with an otherwise frustrating situation. Plus, it can provide a few moments of amusement for both you and your children.\n\nAnother tactic is to answer the call but remain silent. Many telemarketing systems use automated dialing and rely on voice recognition to determine if someone has answered. By staying silent, you can confuse the system and cause the call to disconnect.\n\nOver time, this method can reduce the number of calls you receive from automated systems, as they may flag your number as unresponsive. It’s a passive yet effective way to handle unwanted calls.\n\nOne proactive approach to preventing telemarketing calls is to be cautious about sharing your phone number. Only provide your number to trusted sources and consider using alternatives like email for less essential communications.\n\nBe wary of entering your phone number on websites, online forms, or when signing up for services. Reducing the number of people and entities that have your phone number can decrease the likelihood of it ending up on telemarketers' call lists.\n\nA virtual phone number is another strategy for keeping your primary phone number private. You can use a virtual number for online registrations, business interactions, or subscriptions, and redirect any calls to your main line or screen them separately.\n\nMany services offer virtual phone numbers for a small fee. This way, your primary number remains private while the virtual number can handle potential telemarketing calls. If the virtual number receives too many unwanted calls, you can easily change or dispose of it without affecting your primary contact number.",

    "description": "A CNN NewsNight guest called out commentator Scott Jennings during a tense exchange about the state of the MAGA movement.",
    "fullText": "A CNN NewsNight guest called out commentator Scott Jennings during a tense exchange about the state of the MAGA movement.\n\nMonday’s panel discussed the aftermath of last week’s Turning Point USA event, where Ben Shapiro criticized Tucker Carlson for conducting interviews with white nationalist Nick Fuentes and for refusing to condemn Candace Owens for peddling conspiracy theories about TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Owens, who previously worked for Shapiro at The Daily Wire, has claimed that the Israeli government was involved in the murder.\n\nCarlson spoke moments later and offered a rebuttal. The next night, Steve Bannon spoke at the conference and likewise ripped Shapiro, as did Megyn Kelly. Vice President JD Vance also spoke at the event, where he told the crowd, “You don’t have to apologize for being white anymore.”\n\nOn CNN NewsNight, Republican strategist Tim Parrish said there is no room for anti-Semitism and other forms og bigotry in the GOP and that Vance has adequately condemned such attacks, including his remarks about leaked Young Republican group chats that contained all manner of racial slurs and comments about Jews and “gas chambers.”\n\nVance told the group chat members to “grow up,” but he also criticized the “pearl clutching” by those who harshly condemned the messages and said that “kids do stupid things.”\n\n“You guys are mischaracterizing the statements that the vice president made,” Parrish said. “He absolutely came out and condemned and said that there is no place for any comments like that in the Republican Party.”\n\nAdam Mockler of MeidasTouch rejected the claim.\n\n“JD Vance said he’s gonna warn his kids so some ‘scumbag’ doesn’t leak a group chat in a similar way,” Mockler replied. “He was implying the person who leaked the group chat was a scumbag. JD Vance has had the farthest thing from moral clarity this entire time.”\n\nMockler then pivoted to Paul Ingrassia, who was appointed by President Donald Trump to be the acting general counsel of the U.S. General Services Administration. Leaked text messages from Ingrassia show that he said he has a “Nazi streak” and made racist remarks.\n\nHere is Mockler’s exchange with Parrish and Jennings:\n\nMOCKLER: And listen, do you know who Paul Ingrassia is?\n\nMOCKLER: Do you know who Paul Ingrassia is?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah, we’ve debated it.\n\nMOCKLER: Do you know what– ok, so do you know what Paul Ingrassia said?\n\nJENNINGS: Yeah, we’ve debated it.\n\nMOCKLER: That he has a Nazi streak. Oh, you’ve debated it. But has Trump fired him, or is he still a part of the administration?\n\nJENNINGS: I don’t know where he is right now.\n\nMOCKLER: He’s a part of the administration. And you know that. You’re lying right now. You know that he is a part of the administration. He is still there. And he said he has a “Nazi streak.” So you can sit there and play coy, but you are not having the clarity that you are talking about right now. Do you condemn Paul Ingrassia?\n\nJENNINGS: I certainly condemn anything–\n\nMOCKLER: Should Trump fire Paul Ingrassia?\n\nJENNINGS: –approximating having a Nazi streak.\n\nTwo days after Ingrassia’s texts were made public, Jennings said he agreed with the administration’s decision to withdraw Ingrassia’s nomination as head of the Office of Special Counsel. However, Trump appointed Ingrassia as acting general counsel at the General Services Administration three weeks later.\n\nHours before his appearance on NewsNight, Jennings said Vance will ultimately need to distance himself from conservatives who are “trafficking in hate.”\n\nThe post ‘You’re Lying Right Now’: CNN’s Scott Jennings Gets Cornered by Guest About Trump Official Who Claimed ‘Nazi Streak’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.",
    "fullText": "When Vladimir Putin made a four-day trip to visit Xi Jinping in September, he addressed his Chinese counterpart as a “dear friend”.\n\nSpeaking to Xi across a vast display of orchids in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, the Russian president claimed their ties were “at an unprecedentedly high level”.\n\nCertainly on the surface it appears China’s alliance with Russia has only grown stronger since Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nNowhere has this been more evident than when looking at trade between the two countries, which has boomed ever since the West slapped Putin with massive sanctions.\n\nLast year, the value of trade between Russia and China hit a record $245bn (£182bn), fuelled by Xi becoming the world’s largest buyer of Putin’s oil and gas. Overall, China also became Russia’s biggest supplier of goods.\n\nHowever, closer ties with China have come at a cost.\n\nIn particular, Russian businesses have grown increasingly frustrated at a flood of cheap Chinese goods.\n\nVladimir Milov, who worked in the Russian government from 1997 to 2002 before becoming a vocal Putin critic, says the economic alliance is backfiring badly for Russia.\n\n“It is deeply disadvantageous,” he says. “China is taking advantage because it knows that Russia has nowhere to go.”\n\nSuch warnings could signal that the economic ties between the two countries are beginning to fray.\n\nWhile mutual trade hit a record high in 2024, it has fallen by nearly a tenth so far this year.\n\nOne key area of tension is cars.\n\nAfter Western manufacturers cut ties with Russia in 2022, Chinese competitors duly stepped in.\n\nIn the two years to 2024, Chinese car exports to Russia have increased sevenfold, prompting a growing number of complaints from domestic manufacturers.\n\nMaxim Sokolov, the chief executive of Russian carmaker AvtoVAZ, has accused the Chinese of “unprecedented dumping”, which he said in December has crossed “all imaginable boundaries”.\n\nSales of his company’s signature Lada car have plunged, pushing the company to slash production by nearly half and move to a four-day work week at the end of September.\n\nRussia’s largest truck manufacturer, Kamaz, also trimmed its working week in August after demand for its vehicles plunged by 60pc. At the time it blamed “excessive” imports.\n\nTo alleviate some of the criticism, the Kremlin has responded by significantly raising import fees on vehicles.\n\nSince October 2024, Russia has more than doubled the “recycling fee” that it charges on imported cars.\n\nThis charge, which is supposedly to cover the future disposal of the vehicle but functions largely as a tariff, was 667,000 roubles (£6,275) per vehicle as of January this year.\n\nThis led to Chinese car exports to Russia halving in the first six months of 2025.\n\nIn July, Russian regulators also banned truck imports from a fleet of major Chinese brands – Dongfeng, Foton, FAW and Sitrak – which they branded a “direct threat” to public safety.\n\n“These trade-related tensions will start to occur more and more as the market gets saturated with Chinese goods and uncompetitive Russian industries are not able to make their sales,” says John Kennedy, a research leader at Rand.\n\nThere are signs that Russia’s steel sector is also hurting.\n\nAndrey Gartung, chief executive of the Chelyabinsk Forging and Press Plant, warned last year: “Russian enterprises competing with Chinese ones are holding on by the skin of their teeth.”\n\nNot one to shy away, China has hit back with trade restrictions of its own.\n\nMost notably, Xi reintroduced tariffs on Russian coal in January 2024, two years after the restrictions were first lifted.\n\nThis has already hit exports to China, with Milov claiming that the levies are adding to what is the worst crisis for Russia’s coal industry since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe sector’s revenues are expected to plummet by 12pc this year alone.\n\nElsewhere, China has so far refused to lift a longstanding ban on imports of Russia’s largest agricultural exports – winter wheat and barley. Instead, it buys from Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\n\nWhat China does import from Russia, it gets incredibly cheaply because it has a monopoly as one of Russia’s only buyers, says Milov.\n\nRussia’s biggest exports to China are oil and gas, which combined make up two thirds of its trade.\n\nIgor Sechin, Rosneft’s chief executive, said that between January 2022 and June 2024, China’s savings from purchasing Russian oil compared to Middle Eastern exports amounted to as much as $18bn.\n\n“Taking the sanctions away, Russia is what Beijing would want every trading partner to look like,” says Gregor Sebastian, of Rhodium’s China Corporate Advisory team.\n\n“China is importing raw materials that it produces into manufactured goods that it can then resell at much higher profit margins back to Russia. That is the main bulk of the relationship.”\n\nHowever, more than anything, Russia wants new technology and investment from China. And it is not getting it.\n\nThe average annual flow of Chinese investment into Russia has plummeted from an average of $1.2bn from 2011 to $400m, says Milov.\n\nIn 2022, China dropped Russia from its Belt and Road financing programme, while in July, China’s commerce ministry “strongly advised” carmakers against investing in Russia.\n\nMany major projects that were previously announced with Chinese backing have now been scrapped or are on hold.\n\nRussia quietly disappeared from what was supposed to be a joint development of a long-haul aircraft with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.\n\nWork had already begun on the project, initially called the CR929, which stood for “China Russia”. However, the R has now been dropped, with the aircraft renamed as the C929.\n\nPlans for Chinese CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles to build a high-speed rail line between Moscow and Kazan in south-west Russia have also been paused.\n\nSeparately, there has been no progress on the development of the Tianjin oil refinery, a joint venture between Rosneft and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which was approved in 2014.\n\nAfter the meeting between Putin and Xi in September, Gazprom announced that the two countries had signed a deal to build a “Power of Siberia 2” gas pipeline to China.\n\nBut while this would no doubt prove to be a huge victory for Russia, China has yet to confirm the project.\n\nThis may be a sign that, for all the pomp and ceremony, the countries’ authoritarian alliance may be weaker than it appears.\n\n“Despite all these hugs and kisses at summits, China and Russia are very much far apart,” says Milov.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Tatyana Remley was convicted in a plot to hire a hitman to kill her estranged husband, Mark Remley\n\nAuthorities said the investigation began after a suspicious house fire at the couple’s California property\n\nRemley died on Dec. 18, 2025, from a gunshot wound to the head, the medical examiner said\n\nA California equestrian who was convicted in a plot to have her estranged husband killed has died by suicide, the San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed to PEOPLE.\n\nTatyana Remley died on Dec. 18, 2025, from a gunshot wound to the head. Her death was ruled a suicide, the medical examiner said.\n\nRemley was convicted in a murder-for-hire case involving her estranged husband, Mark Remley. NBC San Diego reported in December 2023 that Remley pleaded guilty to solicitation to commit murder and was sentenced to three years and eight months in state prison.\n\nPEOPLE previously reported that she was arrested in 2023 after allegedly meeting with an undercover officer and offering to pay for her estranged husband’s killing.\n\nThe investigation began after a house fire at the couple’s ranch property in Del Mar, an unincorporated area of San Diego County north of the city, according to the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.\n\nDeputies said an arson unit was called to the scene and that Remley was initially arrested that day for alleged firearms-related offenses after officers said they found three firearms and ammunition in her possession.\n\nThe following day, the sheriff’s department said investigators opened a murder-for-hire investigation after receiving information that Remley was attempting to hire someone to kill her estranged husband.\n\n“She provided detailed information on how she wanted her husband killed and his body disposed of,” the sheriff’s department alleged in a statement. Authorities also claimed that Remley brought firearms and U.S. currency as a down payment for the killing.\n\nAccording to The Coast News, Mark Remley told the outlet that his wife had offered a mutual friend $2 million to kill him. The friend declined and alerted police, prompting a sting operation, the outlet reported. Remley later met with an undercover officer at a local Starbucks, according to The Coast News.\n\nIn divorce papers, Remley said she and a friend were present at the property at the time of the fire but claimed she did not know how it started, The Coast News reported. Her husband, however, told the outlet that he believed the fire was intentionally set after he allegedly discovered she was trying to have him killed.\n\nThe Remleys married in 2011, then separated and reconciled multiple times over the years, according to The Coast News.\n\nRemley was charged with arson in connection with the house fire and was arraigned on Sept. 11, per a criminal complaint shared with PEOPLE by the San Diego County District Attorney's Office. She was scheduled to return to court on March 3, 2026, per the office.\n\nPEOPLE was unable to reach an attorney for Remley or her estranged husband for comment at press time.",

    "fullText": "WICHITA, Kan. (KSNW) – Being a Kansas City Chiefs fan is often about loyalty and emotional commitment. But with the Chiefs announcing Monday that they would leave the historic Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri and move into a not-yet-built $3 billion stadium on the Kansas side of Kansas City, Kansas-based fans soon won’t need to root for their team across state lines.\n\n“That creates energy that I don’t think we really understand or really appreciate until it starts happening, until the stadium gets built, they play their first game, they play their first season,” Kevin Jenks, the president and CEO of the Wichita Sports Commission, said.\n\nThe Chiefs spent more than five decades playing at Arrowhead. They intend to build their new stadium in Wyandotte County, in the same area as Kansas Speedway and the Legends retail district.\n\n‘I just love Arrowhead’: Some Chiefs super fans not sold on move to Kansas\n\nEven though Wichita will be a few hours away from the new field, the hope is that the team’s presence can strengthen the area’s sports identity. Wichita Sports Commission hopes that includes strengthening ongoing partnerships with the franchise.\n\n“The Chiefs have been big proponents of getting flag football into high schools, and we were a part of that locally with some Wichita schools,” Jenks said. “We are still continuing to promote and be a part of that process.”\n\nDr. Larry Straub, an associate professor of business management at Newman University, says the Chiefs’ presence is likely to improve Kansas’ national image. However, he’s skeptical that the financial boom that comes with a major sports team moving in will echo around the state.\n\n“From an economics standpoint, I think the closer you are to Kansas City, the more benefits you’re going to have,” Straub said.\n\nFor more Kansas news, click here.

    "fullText": "On the surface, Manchester City picked up a routine 3-nil win over West Ham at the Etihad last Saturday. In the first half of Saturday’s match, City dominated the game and didn’t allow West Ham to have a single shot on goal. In the second-half, West Ham had their moments, although it must be said that City never really felt like they got out of second gear. Any 3-nil win in the Premier League will be gleefully accepted. Speaking after his team’s win over West Ham, Pep Guardiola was far from pleased with his team’s display. Pep Guardiola’s comments are on the money as there is so much more to come from City this season.\n\nIt was clear after Manchester City’s win that Pep Guardiola was far from pleased with his team’s performance against West Ham. Although Manchester City took a 2-nil lead into halftime, his team had dominated West Ham and really should have been out of sight by halftime. But while City were comfortable in, and dominated, possession in the first half, they didn’t really create a host of chances after Erling Haaland’s 5th-minute goal. City played in first or second gear and didn’t press for another goal. This wasn’t lost on Pep Guardiola as explained to Sky Sports post-match: “With the ball, we are not good. So we give away many things because we are not in the right spots to break the lines and make the next steps.”\n\n“Because the players are not courageous to do that action. But we will improve it because we are so open. The group is amazing, we will try to do it.”\n\n“I’m happy, I cannot deny, but the way we play with the ball we have to improve or it will not be enough in March or April to be a contender to win the league.”\n\n“I said to my players: ‘Merry Christmas for everyone but it will not be enough if we do not improve.”\n\n“With the positions we have to be brave. We were not there. How many chances did they have first half? Zero, none. But even with that we were not in the right places to create, to be more solid. We didn’t do the right process to be more consistent. Gigi [Donnarumma] saved us.”\n\n“If they follow me we will be there, but we have to improve. I know the level in this league, I know Arsenal, I know how tough they are. It’s not enough. The spirit is there. But many, many things we must do better.”\n\nIt is easy to see that Pep Guardiola is playing for keeps this season. The Manchester City manager wants his team to challenge for this season’s Premier League title and perhaps more. He also wants to see his team improve. That seems a ridiculous notion to dig into after a 3-nil win but Pep Guardiola’s point does stand up. Playing consistently like they did against West Ham will likely see City fall short of their goal of winning the Premier League title this season. So improvement is needed from Pep Guardiola’s side. Premier League tickets can be found at the following link to see if Pep Guardiola’s call for his players to improve comes to life in the coming weeks.\n\nIt is easy to see what annoyed Pep Guardiola on Saturday. West Ham offered nothing during the first half of Saturday’s match. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side barely offered a threat. But the City players sat back and didn’t seize the initiative after scoring an early goal. They were possibly lulled into a false sense of security. The City players weren’t brave enough in possession in the first half and didn’t have the movement Pep Guardiola demands of his team to put West Ham away after taking an early lead. It would seem that is what set Pep Guardiola off after his team’s win and it will be interesting to see if this City side goes up a gear after Christmas.\n\nPep Guardiola has spelt out what he wasn’t happy with after his team’s win  over West Ham. Manchester City’s possession and positional play has to improve to see this City side go up a gear. You do sense that the improvement is coming, but Pep Guardiola wants to see it in Manchester City’s next Premier League fixture against Nottingham Forest at The City Ground on December 27.",

    "fullText": "BROOKINGS, S.D. (KELO) — Sunday marked the 19th time the South Dakota State women’s basketball team hosted a nationally-ranked team in the program’s Division-I era, and No. 2 Texas was the highest-ranked foe to ever make the trip to Brookings.\n\nSDSU ultimately fell to the Longhorns 70-51 inside First Bank & Trust Arena, but the Jackrabbits view the experience of playing a Final Four participant from a season ago worthwhile. This year is the fourth straight season the Jacks hosted a ranked team.\n\n“It was just a great opportunity in a lot of ways,” SDSU head coach Aaron Johnston said. “We’ll continue to find chances to play these teams and try and bring them here. We had a great crowd and everybody was into it. It just really I think showed well for where we’re at as a program. But it is hard to play against national championship caliber teams. And that’s really what Texas is.”\n\n“Planning teams like that make us all better,” SDSU senior forward Brooklyn Meyer said. “Obviously they’re long, they’re athletic. It’s good to run our offense and run our plays and stuff like that against a team like that. And so I feel like today was a really good day for growth as a team.”\n\nTexas, now 14-0 this season, saw SDSU as strong preparation for their tough conference slate in the SEC.\n\n“It’s good for us,” Texas head coach Vic Schaefer said. “It’s good for us in getting us ready for the SEC. But it’s also good for the game to grow, the game for our kids to come up here and play in this environment. It’ll help us in the SEC, no doubt about it.”\n\nSDSU is now 9-10 in games against ranked teams in Brookings, but the team will continue to seek these opportunities.\n\n“We’ll continue to move in that direction because I think it helps build our program,” Johnston said. “There’s just absolutely no downside to playing great competition. We’re willing to stretch ourselves. And we’ve learned and grow and learn from it. I think our fans appreciate it. I think our team enjoys it, and we’ll try and keep doing it.”\n\nThe 10-4 Jackrabbits are set to open Summit League play on New Year’s Day against St. Thomas in Brookings.",

    "fullText": "It’s funny how funny things can be — even at the expense of yourself. Let’s run this timeline past you for a quick second:\n\nNotre Dame and BYU were both left out of the college football playoff for different reasons — and both had a case against the committee.\n\nESPN thought they scored a major win with a Notre Dame VS BYU Pop Tarts Bowl matchup.\n\nNotre Dame showed that they had a little more self-respect than others by telling ESPN to take a hike (turning the other cheek is null and void in football).\n\nBYU cries and runs to social media to look for validation like they were a cast member on Secret Lives of Mormon Wives and send out the Mom Talk army.\n\nUSC has been sitting there sad that they suck so bad, and thinking that since they can’t ever beat Notre Dame — they need to end things.\n\nNotre Dame announces a home and home against BYU in 2026 and 2027.\n\nNotre Dame Football Announces Series with BYU\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. – The University of Notre Dame football team has announced that Notre Dame and Brigham Young University will play at Edwards Stadium in Provo, Utah in 2026, and at Notre Dame Stadium in 2027 in a home-and-home series. Specific dates and broadcast information will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe two programs have met on nine previous occasions as the Irish lead the all-time series 7-2. The series is tied at one win apiece in Provo while Notre Dame has a 5-1 advantage at home against BYU. Most recently, the Irish took a 28-20 win over the No. 16 ranked Cougars in the 2022 Shamrock Series contest at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Irish have been ranked on five occasions while the Cougars have been ranked once in the all-time matchups between the two teams. The teams first faced off against one another on October 24, 1992 at Notre Dame Stadium as the No. 10 Irish prevailed 42-16. Notre Dame’s first trip to Provo came on October 16, 1993 and saw the No. 3 ranked Irish win 45-20.\n\nNotre Dame is 29-9-1 against current Big 12 teams all-time. The Irish have faced BYU more than any other current Big 12 member in the history of Notre Dame football.\n\nThem: We’re dOne sCHedulinG GOod nOn-COnfEREnce GaMes\n\nUs: Spot the ball https://t.co/nNhwvLGPD6\n\n— BYU Cougars (@BYUCougars) December 22, 2025\n\nI don’t mind BYU soaking up the glory of NOT being cowards. They have a sense of bravado that probably rivals their namesake (look it up) and to be honest… they need this game. It wasn’t the two losses to Texas Tech that kept BYU out of the playoff at 11-2 — it was the weak Big 12 conference combined with an out of conference schedule that included Portland State, East Carolina, and Stanford.\n\nSo don’t get it twisted. BYU Needs this game and they are more than happy to schedule it — especially one in Provo which they were promised a long time ago. So long ago that legend tells us that some BYU kids look at it as their birthright.\n\nAs much as I am disappointed in the demise of the USC rivalry, this game looks like it could be a lot of fun over the next two years. Maybe it will become a more regular game on the schedule, and maybe it won’t, but for right now I’m going to soak it up.",

    "fullText": "Philip Rivers family tree: Meet 10 kids, grandkid, wife Tiffany and more from Alabama roots originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPhilip Rivers wife: Tiffany Rivers\n\nPhilip Rivers dad: Steve Rivers\n\nOne of the longtime quarterbacks to emerge from the 2000s in the NFL, Philip Rivers certainly lived up to his first-round price tag in the 2004 Draft.\n\nA member of the Los Angeles Chargers franchise for over a decade, including some time in San Diego, Rivers later spent time with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe gunslinger can be found all over NFL all-time passing leaderboards, a durable quarterback who consistently put up solid numbers on an annual basis. Rivers is also well-known for his large family with his wife, Tiffany.\n\nHere's what to know about Philip Rivers' family.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Philip Rivers' Hall of Fame case\n\nPhilip Rivers has 10 kids — seven daughters and three sons — with his wife, Tiffany Rivers. When the youngest child, Andrew Joseph Rivers, was born in November 2023, the oldest Rivers child, Halle Rivers, was 21 years old.\n\nMORE: Full Joe Flacco teams timeline\n\nYes, Philip Rivers is, in fact, a grandfather. His oldest daughter, who was born in 2002 — before he was drafted into the NFL in 2004— has a child.\n\nMORE: What is Justin Herbert's net worth?\n\nHere's what to know about the 10 children of Philip Rivers.\n\nOf Philip Rivers' 10 children, three are sons. The oldest of the bunch is Gunner Rivers, who was born in 2008. Gunner goes by his middle name — his first name is also Philip, like his dad.\n\n\"It's kind of crazy because we're wearing his jersey and sometimes people say 'Hi, Philip Rivers,' because I am wearing the jersey,\" Gunner said in 2019, per People. \"But they don't actually know that I'm actually Philip Rivers! Gunner is my middle name.\"\n\nGunner Rivers was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was five years old. His mother, Tiffany, told People in 2019 that she recalled Gunner \"starting to get really weak and tired,\" and his diagnosis was confirmed through a blood test. Since then, the family has helped him manage the condition.\n\n“What we’ve learned through our experience is that these kids are warriors,” Philip Rivers told PEOPLE. “We have seen firsthand the tremendous responsibility it is for these children to have the discipline to manage the disease with the support of family, and their health providers to live their best lives.”\n\nPhilip and Tiffany sold custom products through Tiffany's swimwear brand, Hermoza, to raise money for diabetes foundations in 2019.\n\nLike his father, Gunner became the starting quarterback at his high school, St. Michael Catholic in Alabama, as a freshman. Philip has coached the team led by his son, saying in 2023 that he doesn't have a desire to coach any higher than high school.\n\n“I think I would have gone right into it had that been what I wanted to do,” Philip Rivers told AL.com. “But, really, I’ve longed to coach my boys and these other 15-18 year-old boys since I was 25. I’m good right here.”\n\nPer AL.com, with Gunner as his starting quarterback, Philip Rivers led St. Michael Catholic to the playoffs in 2023 for the first time in school history. As of 2025, Gunner was a junior and beginning to eye college recruiting, with Philip Rivers telling AL.com that the family was keeping up with college football more because of it.\n\n247Sports has rated Gunner as a four-star quarterback prospect in the class of 2027, listing offers from Auburn, Miami, Boston College and more. And naturally, 247Sports scouting director Andrew Ivins compared Gunner's play style to his father's.\n\n\"Modern pocket passer with elite pedigree that wins with touch, timing and sound decision-making. Owns more of a unique shot put-like release, but makes it work, much like dad did many moons ago,\" Ivins wrote of Gunner Rivers. \"Projects at this stage as a high-end distributor with a rare set of intangibles that has a chance to be a difference-maker at the game’s highest level.\"\n\nAs for Peter Rivers, born in 2011, his father described him as an \"old soul\" to the Indianapolis Star in 2020. Peter also loves sports, his father said.\n\n“He kind of reminds me of a little slot receiver,” Philip Rivers said of Peter, per IndyStar. “Kind of like a Wes Welker.”\n\nThe youngest son is Andrew, who was born in October 2023. He was the Rivers' 10th child.\n\n“It’s awesome. Tiffany is awesome,” Philip Rivers told AL.com when Andrew was born. “It doesn’t matter if it’s the first child or the 10th child. It’s an awesome miracle every time. Everyone is home now, and everyone is good.”\n\nPhilip and Tiffany Rivers have seven daughters. The oldest is Halle, who was born in July 2002 — around two years before Philip reached the NFL, while he still was playing football at NC State. Tiffany also went to NC State.\n\nPer People, Halle previously said that she's used to the public interest that comes with having a quarterback father.\n\n\"He's been famous since before I was born,\" Halle said, per People. \"It's just been normal kind of my whole life. ... He's an NFL quarterback; he's doing a million different things every day, but every day he comes home, and he wants to be with us. If he has one extra minute that he could do something else, he'll be with us.\"\n\nIn 2020, Philip Rivers told the Indianapolis Star that Halle reminds him of his wife.\n\n“She reminds me, big-time, of her mom, which is a big compliment,” Rivers said, per the Indianapolis Star. “The biggest compliment I can probably give.”\n\nAs of 2025, Halle Rivers has a child of her own, making Philip and Tiffany grandparents. Philip announced in May 2025 that he had a new grandson.\n\nCaroline Rivers was the couple's second child, born in 2005, when Philip was beginning his Chargers career.\n\n“Caroline is very strong-willed, and I say that as a huge compliment,” Rivers said of Caroline in 2020. “She’s kind of a go-getter in that regard.”\n\nGrace Rivers, born in 2006, was nicknamed \"Combo\" by her parents at a young age, per the Indianapolis Star, for being like a blend of her mother and her father. She played both tennis and basketball.\n\n“She goes with the flow,” Philip Rivers said of Grace.\n\nBorn in 2010, Sarah Rivers was the couple's fourth daughter. Philip said in 2020 that Grace had gotten into swimming as she tried to find a sport she enjoyed.\n\n“Sarah’s got a big personality, loves to talk,” Philip Rivers said. “She is chatty, and I say that in a good way.”\n\nIn 2013, Philip and Tiffany welcomed their seventh child, Rebecca Rivers, and in 2015, Clare Rivers was their eighth child. Philip called Rebecca \"strong-willed\" to the Indianapolis Star in 2020; he also shared that Clare was born exactly two years after Rebecca, so they share a birthday.\n\n“They use the term they’re 'birthday sisters',” Philip Rivers said. “They enjoy having the same birthday right now. I don’t know if it will be the same when they’re 12 or 14.”\n\nAnna Rivers is the couple's youngest daughter. She was born in March 2019, with the Chargers' social media accounts announcing her birth.\n\nSHE'S HERE.\n\nWelcome to the world, Anna Rivers 👶 https://t.co/oafdNNI6lI\n\n— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) March 26, 2019\n\nBefore Anna was born, Tiffany told WWD that the arrival of their seventh daughter would be a generational experience for the Rivers family.\n\n“This is the third generation in Philip’s family, who has seven girls and two boys so we were pretty excited about that,\" she said. \"When we told his 91-year-old grandfather, he said, ‘You didn’t have to go to the doctor to find that out. I could have told you — that’s family history.’ ”\n\nPhilip Rivers has one known grandson, as his oldest daughter, Halle, welcomed a son. In a video shared by Jon Gruden in May 2025, Philip shared that he had become a grandfather.\n\nMORE:Meet Justin Herbert's full family\n\nPhilip Rivers' wife is Tiffany Rivers. The two met in middle school in Alabama, then began dating in high school before attending North Carolina State University together then getting married in 2001 during their freshman year of college. Since then, Philip and Tiffany have welcomed 10 children.\n\nPhilip told The Chastity Project that he remembered first seeing Tiffany when he was young.\n\n“With Tiffany, I remember pointing her out at a ballgame at the ball field when I was young,” he said. “But I remember telling my mom, ‘Hey Mom, see that girl over there, she’s a good girl.’ And she was centered on faith and Christ. She had those values that I was looking for.”\n\nPhilip also said that while he grew up in the Catholic Church, his wife converted and became a Catholic the day before their wedding.\n\n“My wife had a lot to do with it, she’s a convert and she actually became Catholic the day before we got married,\" Philip told Life Teen, per The Christian Post. \"There’s so many gifts from the Faith to appreciate and it strikes people differently, but the one-ness of the Church wherever you are, Raleigh, San Diego, Alabama. Every place we were was home because the Catholic Church is the same everywhere.\"\n\nPhilip and Tiffany welcomed their first daughter, Halle, while they were in school at NC State in 2002. Philip was the starting quarterback for the Wolfpack, while Tiffany \"had a job working with children,\" per People.\n\nIn 2019, Philip spoke about how \"steady\" Tiffany has been as a mother and wife for their family.\n\n\"\"Our family wouldn't be what it is without her. She provides a great steadiness for all of us,\" he said. \"She's great for me also from a football standpoint as far as balancing my energy and passion I have for football. And she's the same with our family.\"\n\nThrough all the ups and downs that comes with football, and all the commitments that I obviously have, I can't imagine doing this without her. There's no way I could do it without her.\"\n\nTiffany co-founded a swimwear line called Hermoza alongside Marisa De Lecce. She also worked with Philip in 2009 to create the Rivers of Hope Foundation, which helped orphaned and foster children find homes. The nonprofit raised over $1 million until its closure in 2013.\n\n\"Tiffany and I are honored to be involved in bringing hope and awareness to the plight of foster children in San Diego County. But now we want to broaden our focus and take a behind-the-scenes approach to helping children,\" Philip said in a statement at the time, per CBS 8. \"Tiffany and I have seen great things happen in the last four years with the public foundation, and now we want to expand our personal efforts for these purposes. It takes us out of the public eye and puts the kids center-stage.”\n\nMORE: Anthony Richardson's full family tree\n\nIn December 2025, when Rivers was playing his second game since un-retiring for the Colts, his entire family was in attendance to watch him take on the San Francisco 49ers.

He coached at Pelham for two years, Decatur for 15 and Athens High for four years. At Athens High, he coached Philip before he became a college and NFL star.\n\nSteve also coached in North Carolina at Wakefield High. As of 2020, Steve and his wife, Joan, lived in Decatur, where he used to coach, per AL.com.\n\nPhilip wound up following in his father's footsteps by coaching his own son, Gunner, in high school football.\n\n\"He told me he wanted to coach his sons, Gunner and Pete. He’ll tell you today some of the best times he ever had were playing for Athens High,\" Steve told AL.com of Philip coaching. He loved playing high school football and being part of a team that I was coaching. He always looked forward to playing for me. He has been around it his whole life. He longed for the day when he could play and now he is looking forward to the day when he is coaching, but he’s also focused on the Colts.”\n\nMORE:Looking back at the oldest players ever selected in the NFL Draft\n\nPhilip Rivers' mother's name is Joan Rivers — but not the famous late comedian, who is from New York.\n\nMORE:Ranking the best QBs taken with picks 1-32, from Peyton Manning to Lamar Jackson\n\nRivers' mother, Joan Rivers, is a school teacher from Alabama.

We need Philip upright. Other than that, I'm real nervous during the game because I want him to win so bad, and I am competitive. I'm just so pleased with everything that has happened in his life. He's just been such a good role model for his brother and sister, and for even us. He's such a good leader. He leads our family, in a way.

From the summer of tournaments in women’s football across Europe, South America and Africa to rinks and courts across the globe, attendance and TV ratings remain on the rise.\n\nFor the first time, the National Women’s Soccer League cracked one million viewers for its championship game, all of whom were treated to the magic of Rose Lavelle’s left foot. Try watching footage of any of the fan walks in Switzerland from Euro 2025 without a smile — an impossible challenge.\n\nWomen’s basketball has always been bigger than any single player, and from the college game to the pros, everyone capitalized on the massive boost from 2024. UConn and the Aces rose to the top once again, with plenty of drama and excitement along the way.\n\nNew leagues and competitions sparked joy. Napheesa Collier and the Lunar Owls cried, “Hootie Hoo!” at Unrivaled, Bayern Munich danced their way through the first World Sevens and new leagues in volleyball and softball joined the ecosystem, with even more ready to enter the fray in 2026.\n\nIt feels impossible to sum up another beautifully chaotic year in women’s sports, but that challenge didn’t stop us. Here, The Athletic’s writers from across the globe pick the moments that stood out for them in 2025.\n\nAnd the best part? We know this list will be even harder to write in 2026.\n\nThis wasn’t the way it was supposed to happen.\n\nMikaela Shiffrin was supposed to reach her century of World Cup race wins at the start of the season, near her childhood home and the school that helped make her a champion in Vermont.\n\nInstead, the races in Killington in November 2024 nearly ended her career. A violent crash sent her tumbling across the snow. She suffered a puncture wound in her abdomen; whatever caused it nearly tore through her colon.\n\nShiffrin spent the next nine weeks recovering physically, before returning to the slopes in February, fit in her body but a shadow of her former self, unable even to make it down a giant slalom hill.\n\nShe arrived in Sestriere, Italy, with low expectations, but after the first run, she had a lead of just under a 10th of a second. That meant she had to go hard or go home in the second run.\n\nOf course, she went hard, and secured that unprecedented 100th victory.\n\n“The mountain ahead of me is steep and long,” Shiffrin said during a news conference after the race. “I just have to take this day and be grateful for it. Because it’s a small moment in the middle of many tough moments that makes me feel like maybe I can be good again.”\n\nMaybe? Shiffrin started the 2025-26 season winning four consecutive slalom races. Now she has 105 wins — and counting.\n\nUConn star Paige Bueckers earned the storybook ending to her collegiate career as the Huskies demolished UCLA and South Carolina in the 2025 Final Four to win their 12th title in program history. ESPN’s Ryan Ruocco had been sitting on the final call of “the book of Bueckers”, as the UConn guard had been destined for stardom for years.\n\nBueckers was the top recruit in a loaded 2020 high school class (one that included Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink in its top five) and immediately fulfilled that promise by winning national player of the year honors as a freshman. Her debut season ultimately ended in disappointment in the national semifinals, as the Huskies’ title drought extended to five years, and the real struggle was yet to come. Over the next three seasons, Bueckers was betrayed by her own body with multiple leg injuries and her teammates’ inability to stay healthy, causing her to delay her entrance into the WNBA and play a fifth and final year at UConn.\n\nThe payoff came in 2025. With a healthy Azzi Fudd and freshman phenom Sarah Strong by her side, Bueckers led the Huskies to the promised land as UConn won its first championship in nine years.\n\nAfter four Final Fours and three All-American seasons, Bueckers cried on coach Geno Auriemma’s shoulder as she exited her last game with victory in hand, adding the ultimate item to her historic college resume. Eight days later, Bueckers was the obvious No. 1 pick in the WNBA Draft, en route to being named an All-Star, all-WNBA and rookie of the year.\n\nWhile Turki Al-Sheikh, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority, continues to ignore its existence, women’s boxing plants its feet and keeps on punching, producing historic moments such as the night of July 11 this year, when one of the greatest female fighters of all time, Katie Taylor defended her undisputed junior welterweight title against Amanda Serrano inside Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe entire night was a showcase of women’s boxing, with the trilogy fight between Taylor and Serrano headlining the first all-female boxing card to be held at the Garden, featuring three undisputed and two unified title fights. It all took place in front of a sellout crowd of 19,721, split between Irish and Puerto Rican fans, with millions more watching the Netflix-streamed show (nearly six million globally tuned in from opening to closing bell).\n\nThe main event went Taylor’s way via majority decision after a tight 10-round battle, giving the Irishwoman a three-fight sweep over the unified featherweight world champion, though this was undoubtedly the most convincing win of the three. Despite the single-sided outcome, their trilogy will go down in history as one of the most significant battles in women’s boxing history, showing the sport deserves its place in the brightest of spotlights.\n\nEngland were heading home. Within 25 minutes, they were 2-0 down against Sweden in soccer’s European Championship quarterfinals. They had dug themselves a deep hole and it seemed there was no way back. All Sweden had to do was hold on for 11 minutes…\n\nBut then up popped Lucy Bronze at the back post. Still at 2-1, Sweden could nick it. Then came England’s saviour, 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang, levelling the game at 2-2.\n\nA collision, bloody nose, cramp and Bronze strapping her own leg added to the drama of extra time before a topsy-turvy penalty shootout that went to sudden death. Hannah Hampton should be credited for saving two spot kicks but I have never seen someone strut up to the spot, whip off a bandage and dispatch their penalty with such ruthlessness as Bronze did. She later revealed she had been playing with a broken bone in her leg.\n\nThe Lionesses should have been down and out. Through sheer grit, they rose again on their way to becoming European champions. Again.\n\nOn an October Friday night in Phoenix, A’ja Wilson strutted around the underbelly of Mortgage Matchup Center, rattling a pink tambourine. The Las Vegas Aces had won their third title in four seasons and Wilson, the league’s first four-time MVP, was basking in the victory, parading around the stadium. She was heard as loudly as her play was impactful.\n\nThere was little drama entering that evening’s contest in large part because of what Wilson did two nights earlier. With 0.3 seconds remaining in Game 3 of Las Vegas’ WNBA Finals matchup with the Phoenix Mercury, and Las Vegas leading the series 2-0, Wilson sank the biggest shot of her career. She drove left from the elbow, spun away from the rim to create space, and elevated for a short jumper over the outstretched arms of Phoenix’s Alyssa Thomas.\n\nFor the briefest of seconds, the ball rattled around the rim. Then it fell, giving Las Vegas a two-point lead and a decisive advantage in the series. They would close it out 48 hours later.\n\nThe shot was the moment of an, at times, underwhelming finals (in part because of Las Vegas’ dominance), and a defining moment for Wilson. The play call had been simple: put the ball in the MVP’s hands. The memory of what happened will last for years to come.\n\nThe PWHL welcomed two new teams in Vancouver and Seattle — the league’s first wave of expansion after two seasons of early success and rapid growth — and brought on seismic change.\n\nRosters were torn apart, with superstars Hilary Knight and Sarah Nurse on the move due to the league’s player dispersion process. Each team lost four players from its 2024-25 roster through the expansion draft and exclusive signing window, which was designed to ensure the PWHL’s newest teams could compete on day one.\n\nWhile there have been some growing pains early in the 2025-26 season, Seattle and Vancouver have two of the most talented rosters in the PWHL. They’re also already two of the league’s most successful teams from a business perspective.\n\nIn its first-ever game on Nov. 21, the Vancouver Goldeneyes sold out the Pacific Coliseum (14,958) and drew the largest crowd of any game played at a regular PWHL home venue. One week later, the Seattle Torrent beat that record with 16,014 at Climate Pledge Arena, which also set a record for attendance at a professional women’s hockey game in the United States.\n\nAccording to the league, Seattle had the most single-day jersey sales in PWHL history when the team’s inaugural jerseys went on sale Oct. 21. Vancouver was right on its heels, and has sold the most season tickets league-wide. Seattle, the league said, is third, behind Toronto.\n\nAnd more change is soon to come in 2026.\n\nThe league could add between two and four teams by next season, according to executive vice president of business operations Amy Scheer, who went public with the plans when addressing Ottawa city council last month and doubled down on those plans in an interview with CNBC.\n\n“We are expanding again, it’s either two to four teams,” she said. “If I were a betting woman, I’d say it’d be four teams. And then I think we’ll hold at 12 for a bit.”\n\nAll sporting events produce joy and misery on some level. And then there is the 2025 Wimbledon women’s singles final.\n\nOn one side of the net, Iga Świątek cemented her status as the greatest player of her era with a dominant 6-0, 6-0 win, capturing the most important title in tennis — and the one that she least expected to win.\n\nAfter the most difficult period of her career, her status as the best since Serena Williams became inarguable.\n\nIt doesn’t get more perfect than that.\n\nOn the other side of the net was Amanda Anisimova. A year prior, she had been outside the top 300 and had failed to qualify for Wimbledon. Now she’d made the final — and froze, on the most hallowed stage in tennis, in front of millions of people around the world.\n\nAnisimova’s mother rarely attends her matches out of superstition. She’d flown across the Atlantic for this one. Ugh.\n\nBut then, Anisimova, who lost her father to a sudden heart attack at 17, gave a tearful speech that was sad and rousing all at once, a tribute to her mother for her love and loyalty that announced her to the world as a sports star in her lowest tennis moment.\n\nAnd seven weeks later, at the U.S. Open, Anisimova found Świątek across the net again — and managed to exorcize the ghosts of the grass with a win.\n\nAs the primary story of the NWSL offseason, Trinity Rodman is the free agent figuring out if she can stay with the Washington Spirit and get paid what she’s worth. Remembering her emotional return to the field in August is the perfect reminder of why so much of the conversation revolves around her.\n\nAfter months recovering from a lingering back injury, Rodman returned to the pitch at Audi Field, but was not fit enough to start. Instead, 15 minutes was all she needed to score a game-winning goal over the Portland Thorns, immediately bursting into tears as she was swarmed by her teammates in celebration.\n\nRodman is the shooting star of the NWSL, and now the flashpoint for the existential question of how the league retains its biggest talent — but she’s also just a 23-year-old human, trying to play the game she loves.\n\nOn a wet track at the Japan National Stadium in September, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone ran her way, once more, into the record books.\n\nThe 26-year-old had boldly switched from the 400-metre hurdles to the one-lap flat, moving out of an event in which she holds the world record and forfeiting an almost certain gold medal over the barriers.\n\nIn her way stood Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino and defending world champion Salwa Eid Naser. Paulino clocked 47.98secs, but McLaughlin-Levrone stunned them both, flying round in 47.78secs, the second-fastest time by a woman and only 0.18s off Marita Koch’s 1985 world record.\n\nIt was the first race where two women had run 400m in under 48 seconds.\n\nDuring another French Open blighted by allegations of sexist scheduling, Loïs Boisson offered the best possible rejoinder.\n\nThe wild-card entry, ranked No. 361 at the time, became the first Frenchwoman since 2011 to reach the semifinals, and her run became one of the stories of the tournament.\n\nOn one level, it was personal: Boisson had a wild card in 2024, but tore a knee ligament just before the tournament. She did not even watch it on TV.\n\nBut it also came in the context of zero women’s matches being selected for the coveted night slot on Court Philippe-Chatrier, the main stadium, for the second year in a row. Women’s matches also opened play — a slot with the stands at their most empty — every day of the tournament that both men’s and women’s matches were played. Tournament officials maintained that the decisions were not a comment on the quality of women’s tennis.\n\nBoisson’s fourth-round match, against then-world No. 3 Jessica Pegula, was declined for the primetime slot by the tournament, multiple people briefed on discussions between Amazon and the French Open told The Athletic at the time.\n\nSo Boisson started the biggest match of her life in front of swathes of empty seats, which steadily filled as news of an upset swept across Roland Garros and Boisson became the first home women’s quarterfinalist at Roland Garros for eight years.\n\nBoisson then beat No. 6 seed Mirra Andreeva to reach the semis, where she lost to eventual winner Coco Gauff. But her stirring performances captured the imagination of supporters and showed the potency of women role models being given the sport’s biggest stages — especially at their home event.\n\nLottie Woad began the year as the reigning amateur world No. 1 of women’s golf. She will end it ranked 11th on the Rolex professional world rankings.\n\nIn July, we saw a “Woad summer”: the Englishwoman, 21, started July by winning the Irish Open by six strokes. One week later, she finished third at the Evian Championship, one of the women’s game’s five majors. The best part? She was still an amateur at both events, so had to forego earnings of around half a million pounds ($660,000).\n\nBut it wasn’t riches Woad — who has since earned $831,400 — sought, it was the holy grail: an LPGA Tour card.\n\nThen, on the last weekend of July, Woad won the Scottish Open at Dundonald Links by three shots. It was her professional debut and the first time since 2018 that a women’s golfer had won their inaugural event after turning pro – that has only happened twice before.\n\n“If you don’t know who Lottie is, you don’t follow golf,” Amy Bond, Woad’s coach at Florida State University, told The Athletic at the time. Plenty of people know her name now, that’s for sure.\n\nBefore the WNBA’s mid-season showcase, players participating in the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game took the floor in Indianapolis revealing a message on their shirts: “Pay Us What You Owe Us.” The shirts made a clear statement, one that resonated across the sporting landscape and brought waves of attention to the ongoing collective bargaining agreement (CBA) discussion between the players union and the league.\n\nThe WNBA is generating record revenue and expanding. Franchise valuations are soaring. Amid the growth period, players are seeking a significant change not just in how much they are being paid, but to the salary system that determines what they are being paid.\n\nTensions between the two sides continued to escalate throughout the summer and into the fall, highlighted by a press conference on the eve of the WNBA Finals when Minnesota Lynx Napheesa Collier lambasted WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert and the league office. Collier said the WNBA has “the worst leadership in the world.” Engelbert was pressed to answer questions about her job status.\n\nAnd while those questions have publicly dissipated, the two sides remain on edge. They have agreed to two extensions of the deadline in recent months, but gaps remain and it is unclear when a new agreement will be reached.\n\nThe women’s rugby union World Cup in England was a watershed moment, a line drawn in the sand that marked a before and after.\n\nA record 81,885 fans attended the final in which England beat Canada 33-13 at London’s Twickenham Stadium, the largest women’s rugby crowd in history. It represented a 518 per cent increase from 15 years ago, when England hosted the 2010 World Cup final at the Twickenham Stoop, which has a capacity of 14,800.\n\nWhat’s more, 50 per cent of fans had never been to a women’s rugby match before. Across the tournament, 444,465 tickets were sold, three times more than the 2022 World Cup.\n\nParallels can be drawn with England women’s triumph on home soil at soccer’s Euro 2022. “What we are trying to prove is that it’s not just a one-off with football,” England winger Abby Dow told reporters. “It’s women’s sport as a whole and it is here to stay.”\n\nThere’s just something about a Gotham run in the playoffs coming in on the final day of the regular season as the final team to clinch the postseason. They won it all in 2023 that way, and managed to repeat the feat in 2025 thanks to clutch performances from Rose Lavelle, Jaedyn Shaw, Emily Sonnett and Ann-Katrin Berger.\n\nAdd in an instant classic of a quote from Shaw, dropped after Gotham upended the Kansas City Current (winners of the NWSL Shield by a whopping 21 points in a historically great season) in Kansas City. Then, they went to Orlando and beat last year’s champions, led by Marta. Finally, the win in San Jose over the Washington Spirit thanks to a Lavelle banger late in the match. An instant classic of a playoff run ending in lifting the Tiffany trophy for the second time in three years.\n\nThey’ll add it to the hardware cabinet, alongside May’s trophy for winning the inaugural Concacaf W Champions Cup. Continental champions and domestic bragging rights — it’s a solid way to wrap 2025, and maybe the start of another NWSL dynasty.\n\nWhen India lost three games in the group stage of their home cricket World Cup, pressure grew. But the team captained by Harmanpreet Kaur, who would go on to make the winning catch in the final against South Africa, reset themselves on their way to a stunning victory in Navi Mumbai.\n\nThe final itself at the DY Patil Stadium was intense. India lost the toss and batted first. A two-hour rain delay stood in their way but when it cleared, they got off to a flier. Shafali Verma hit 87 off 79 balls to set India up for glory as they put up a score of 298-7, the second-highest total in a World Cup final. Smriti Mandhana scored 45 to take her total for the tournament to 434 runs, the most by a player at a World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa, led by captain Laura Wolvaardt, who posted 101 runs, didn’t give up. But the host nation had Deepti Sharma in stellar form and she took five wickets to stop South Africa as India won by 52 to become world champions for the first time.\n\nWhen Lindsey Vonn and her damaged knees barreled out of the start gate at the 2019 World Championships in Sweden for one last time, it was the denouement of one of the greatest careers in Alpine skiing history.\n\nAt the finishing line in the Swedish resort of Are was Ingemar Stenmark, whose then-record of 86 World Cup wins she was four short of equalling. She had begged him to come, she would later tell a crowded news conference. Her father, Alan, and sister, Karin, were there, too. She had always wanted to break Stenmark’s record but this was meant to be the last race for a champion whose body was, she said, “broken beyond repair.”\n\nCompeting in such a brutal event had taken its toll. The injury list over the years was lengthy: broken right arm, fractures in the left knee, broken left ankle, torn ligaments, broken bone in the right leg, concussion.\n\nBut then came a partial knee replacement in 2024 and one of the greatest comebacks in modern sport.\n\nWith titanium in her right knee, the most famous skier of her generation, the first American to win the women’s Olympic downhill, was pain-free for the first time in years.\n\nBut Vonn isn’t merely competing again. She is fast. Not only did she win the year’s first World Cup downhill in Saint Moritz, Switzerland, this month, but she also did so by nearly a second. The next day, she finished on the podium again in the downhill.\n\nWith the 2026 Olympics under two months away, the 41-year-old is a contender and that is remarkable — or, as she said in February, a “miracle.”\n\nLet us know which of these picks was your favorite of 2025 — and tell us about any we have missed! — in the comments below.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nGotham FC, WNBA, Golf, Boxing, Women's Soccer, Women's College Basketball, Olympics, Women's Euros, Women's Hockey, Tennis, Global Sports, Cricket\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

He’s led them to an NBA championship, a conference finals appearance and two 60-win seasons (and counting) since replacing Ime Udoka prior to the 2022-23 campaign.\n\nMazzulla’s tenure has been defined by winning. On Monday, he notched his 200th career regular-season win in his 275th game, becoming the third-fastest head coach in NBA history to reach that milestone behind only Steve Kerr (238) and Hall of Famer Phil Jackson (270).\n\nFor reference, both of them did so with dynasties. Jackson did it with Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls in the early 1990s, while Kerr had the mid-2010s Golden State Warriors.\n\nJoe Mazzulla won his 200th game tonight.\n\nHe reached the mark in 275 games, making him the third-fastest coach in NBA history to do so behind Steve Kerr (238 games) and Phil Jackson (270 games).\n\n— Celtics Stats (@celtics_stats) December 23, 2025\n\nMazzulla’s Celtics may not be a dynasty yet, but there’s still time to become one as long as Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are around. In the meantime, Mazzulla is proving himself as an NBA Coach of the Year candidate this season with a short-handed roster.\n\nInterestingly, Mazzulla’s 200th win was among his strangest yet. Boston got off to a slow start and trailed the lowly Indiana Pacers by as many as 20 points in the third quarter. He responded by pulling his starters, which sparked a huge comeback by the Celtics in their 103-95 victory.\n\nMazzulla’s career regular-season record now stands at 200-75–good for a .727 winning percentage. The 37-year-old will look to improve on that mark on Friday when Boston kicks off a five-game road trip against the Pacers.\n\nCeltics’ Bench Sparks Massive Comeback Vs.

    "description": "Here's what's known about Indianapolis' plans for its 44-year-old quarterback, and why it may make sense to stop playing Rivers.",
    "fullText": "Will the Colts bench Philip Rivers? Why Indianapolis could turn to Riley Leonard following Week 16 loss to 49ers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philip Rivers experiment has been a thrilling one for the Indianapolis Colts. But after just around two weeks, it could be time for them to call it quits.\n\nIndianapolis, which signed the veteran quarterback out of retirement in Week 15, has now lost five consecutive games in total, including two with Rivers starting, after Monday night's 48-27 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. And while the Colts haven't mathematically been eliminated from playoff contention, their chances are slim.\n\nLate in the blowout loss on Monday night, young backup quarterback Riley Leonard entered the game for the Colts. Considering Rivers was brought in to help the team make a potential playoff push, will Indianapolis consider benching the veteran for Week 17, potentially sending him back into retirement?\n\nHere's what's known about the Colts' plans for Philip Rivers and why it would make sense for them to turn elsewhere in their quarterback room.\n\nMORE:Philip Rivers' full stats, highlights from second start vs. 49ers\n\nIt's officially unknown whether the Colts will continue letting Philip Rivers start at quarterback into Week 17, but unless head coach Shane Steichen says otherwise, Rivers as QB1 should be the expectation for now.\n\nAfter their Week 16 loss to San Francisco, Steichen or Rivers were not asked about the quarterback's starting status for Week 17. However, even with Riley Leonard coming into the game late in the fourth quarter of Monday's matchup, one previous comment from Steichen about Rivers remains prominent: \"We didn’t bring him in here to sit on the bench.\"\n\nPer NBC Sports, when Steichen was asked leading into Week 16 about giving a potentially-healthy Anthony Richardson a shot at quarterback, the head coach said the Colts didn't sign Rivers to have him sit on the bench.\n\n“He’s excited for this challenge,\" Steichen said of Rivers. \"We obviously got to take it one week at a time, and then we go from there.”\n\nWhether those comments will hold true even with the Colts' playoff hopes dangling by a thread remains to be seen, but until Steichen announces Leonard or Richardson as the new starter, expect to see the 44-year-old Rivers out there again for Indianapolis.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about Philip Rivers' 10 kids, family\n\nTechnically, the Colts are not out of the playoff race. They trail the Houston Texans for the AFC's No. 7 seed by two games, but they also play Houston in Week 18. If the Colts win and the Texans lose in Week 17, they could set themselves up for a win-and-in game to end the regular season.\n\nHowever, with the way things have gone for Indianapolis lately — Daniel Jones' Achilles injury, a five-game losing streak and 48 points surrendered to the 49ers — it's fair to wonder if it'd be more beneficial for the franchise to get good looks at a younger quarterback that coaches know will be around in 2026.\n\nRivers will be returning to retirement after the 2025 season regardless of the Colts' playoff push, and the team is entering an offseason carrying a major quarterback decision with Daniel Jones being a free agent. With playoff chances low and two young quarterbacks on the roster in Riley Leonard and Anthony Richardson (depending on health), assessing either passer over the final two games could be more beneficial than allowing Rivers to continue risking his health for a team likely outside of the playoff picture.\n\nIf the Colts are dead-set on maximizing their playoff chances, even if they're extremely slim, then Rivers as QB1 makes sense. But if they're being more realistic about their current outlook, perhaps it's time to end the Rivers experiment.\n\nMORE: What happened to Anthony Richardson?\n\nThe Colts' tough Week 17 matchup doesn't make the decision any easier, as they'll host the AFC South-leading Jacksonville Jaguars next week. The Jaguars are coming off a statement win over the Broncos in Week 16.\n\nIf, somehow, Indianapolis beats Jacksonville and Houston falls to the Chargers, then the Colts' playoff chances would be alive heading into a Week 18 against the Texans.\n\nMORE: Inside Philip Rivers' high school coaching career\n\nThe Colts signed Rivers because of their injured quarterback room. Jones is done for the season after some terrific play in 2025, while his backup, former first-rounder Anthony Richardson, suffered an orbital fracture from a pregame incident that's left him on IR for months.\n\nRichardson has made progress in his healing from the injury lately, but his return this season is not guaranteed. That leaves Leonard, the rookie from Notre Dame, as the only healthy option behind Rivers on the Colts' active roster.\n\nLeonard did play virtually one whole game for Indianapolis already, stepping in against the Jaguars after Jones' Achilles injury. In that game, Leonard totaled 145 passing yards and no passing touchdowns with an interception, plus five yards and a touchdown on the ground.\n\nMORE:Full Colts quarterback timeline since Andrew Luck's retirement",

    "fullText": "A group of Greek football supporters who are \"crazy about non-league football\" have established a continental fan group of a historic club which they said represented the best \"qualities\" of the British game.\n\nKonstantinos Tsilimpiou and Nireas Habidis help run Egglezoi, a Greek website which specialises in covering English football, and have started a collaboration with Kettering Town.\n\nThe group said it had started supporting the Poppies, of the Southern League Premier Central division, after an idea to follow a non-league side for a feature on its site.\n\nKettering chairman George Akhtar said he hoped the link-up would help Northamptonshire's Greek community feel \"more connected\" to the club.\n\nThe partnership between the Poppies and Egglezoi, which means Englishmen, sees the club and website share content, including club news, match highlights and interviews on each other's social media platforms.\n\nMr Tsilimpiou and Mr Habidis have also started an official Kettering Town Greek fan group called Paparunes - the Greek word for Poppies - and have ambitions to one day bring a group of supporters to a Kettering Town game.\n\nThe idea to follow Kettering was put forward by Mr Habidis after he had watched two Poppies games on previous visits to England when visiting friends.\n\nHe explained that he had first attended a Manchester United game at Old Trafford, but was disappointed with the atmosphere which he described as \"totally soulless\" and likened to a \"tourist attraction\".\n\nHe said: \"Two days later I went to Latimer Park to watch a game and it was so much different... the way people experience the football club.\n\n\"It felt amazing and I thought 'this is what English football is all about'. That personal link made it easy to make Kettering the club for our project.\"\n\nMr Tsilimpiou, who lives in Athens, said the \"passion\" of English football fans had inspired the creation of Egglezoi about 10 years ago.\n\nThe group now has tens of thousands of followers across its social media accounts.\n\nHe said: \"Paparunes started with an idea. Non-league represents everything we love about football. The culture, the atmosphere, the tradition and the community around the football.\n\n\"Kettering Town was the best example of all of these. We're excited to bring these qualities of real English football to Greek fans.\"\n\nHe added that the \"perfect result\" of the collaboration would be to visit Kettering Town and meet the people behind the club and build a \"strong friendship that will last for many, many years\".\n\nPoppies chairman Mr Akhtar said the club had seen a \"spike\" in its social media following since teaming up with Egglezoi.\n\n\"It's early days in the connection,\" he said. \"We just want to see how it flourishes, but it's an example of how social media reaches every corner of the globe.\n\n\"It is a great opportunity to spread our name and our wings. It isn't costing us any money, it's a bit of fun... but there is a big Greek population locally and I hope it will make them feel more connected to our club.\n\nKettering Town have never played in the English Football League, but have a rich history in England's lower leagues.\n\nThe Poppies, who last played in the top division of non-league football in 2012, have had a number of well-known managers over the years, including Ron Atkinson and even Paul Gascoigne.\n\nThey also made history by becoming the first British club to play with a sponsor on their shirts in 1976.\n\nThe club also holds the unique record of having scored more FA Cup goals than any other side in the competition's illustrious history.\n\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nThe lost ground that was town's 'Angel of the North'\n\nBrother and sister's plan to revive Kettering Town\n\nMcDonald aims to spark Kettering revival",

    "description": "Despite a tough season, the Twins' farm system is booming with talent like Walker Jenkins and Emmanuel Rodriguez.",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins have quietly built one of baseball's strongest farm systems, and a recent MLB.com report confirms what scouts and analysts have been saying all year.\n\nDespite finishing the 2025 season with a disappointing 70-92 record and landing in fourth place in the American League Central, the Twins' future remains bright thanks to a talented collection of young players who could make a major impact in 2026 and beyond.\n\nMLB Pipeline's Sam Dykstra included the Twins among the organizations that took the biggest jumps in 2025, highlighting the development of several top prospects.\n\n\"Despite an early hamstring strain, 2023 fifth overall pick Walker Jenkins solidified his place as one of the game's best hitting prospects with his climb to Double-A Wichita, and he gives the Twins a\" strong foundation for the future, Dykstra wrote. \"At the time of our midseason farm system rankings, Minnesota boasted six Top 100 talents and placed second,\" he added, noting that while guys moving up will cause some movement in the rankings, there's no denying Jenkins' star power alongside the toolsy Emmanuel Rodriguez.\n\nHow soon will we see Emmanuel Rodriguez with the #MNTwins in 2026?\n\nSlashed .258/.429/.423 (.853 OPS) at just 22 years old in 52 games at Triple-A.\n\nAlso had an OPS over 1.000 in the Dominican Winter League. pic.twitter.com/9PIiMtDPYP\n\n— SleeperTwins (@SleeperMLBTwins) November 29, 2025\n\nThe Twins finished 18 games out of first place in 2025, but that rough season came with a silver lining as the organization held a trade deadline fire sale that brought back several promising prospects and helped restock an already impressive farm system.\n\nJenkins, who is currently ranked as the number three overall prospect in baseball by MLB Pipeline, showed why he's considered a future superstar by advancing all the way to Triple-A St. Paul at just 20 years old and making significant progress with his power development.\n\nThe five-tool outfielder hit .282/.394/.439 across 82 games in 2024 at multiple levels before working through the upper minors in 2025, and scouts believe he has the potential to be the top prospect in baseball heading into his big league debut.\n\nWalker Jenkins played a career-high 84 games this season and looked great. The 20-year-old slashed .286/.399/.451 with an .850 OPS and a 136 wRC+. His balanced offensive profile and ability to get his barrel in the zone on time allows for plenty of pull-side contact. pic.twitter.com/kj3aalA9Hy\n\n— Running From The OPS (@OPS_BASEBALL) November 29, 2025\n\nRodriguez, the Twins' number two prospect who ranks 32nd overall in MLB Pipeline's Top 100, also made waves by playing through injuries and showing elite plate discipline at Triple-A.\n\nAfter missing significant time with thumb issues, the 22-year-old Dominican outfielder crushed opposing pitching in the Dominican Winter League during the offseason, posting a .292/.417/.646 slash line with four home runs in just 18 games and earning MVP honors at an all-star game.\n\nBest Twins prospect per position:\n\nC: Eduardo Tait\n1B: Enrique Jimenez\n2B: Dameury Pena\nSS: Kaelen Culpepper 🎥\n3B: Andy Lugo\nLF: Gabriel Gonzalez\nCF: Emmanuel Rodriguez\nRF: Walker Jenkins\nDH: Hendry Mendez\n\nRHP: Riley Quick\nLHP: Kendry Rojas\n\nOF is elite 💎 pic.twitter.com/FQxEKnF9Mm\n\n— LouisAnalysis (@LouisAnalysis) December 22, 2025\n\nBoth Jenkins and Rodriguez could potentially make their Minnesota debuts sometime in 2026, with Jenkins likely arriving in the summer months and Rodriguez potentially cracking the Opening Day roster if he performs well in spring training.\n\nThe combination of Jenkins' all-around skill set and Rodriguez's power-patience approach gives the Twins two legitimate impact bats who could help turn around a franchise that has struggled to compete in recent years, and the additions made at the trade deadline have only strengthened a system that already ranked among baseball's best.",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are unlikely to be picking high in the 2026 NFL Draft unless they pull off a surprising trade. Meanwhile, two of their biggest rivals, the Miami Dolphins and New York Jets, are expected to be near the top of the draft order.\n\nBoth Miami and New York might be eyeing a rookie quarterback in the first round. Pro Football Focus’s Gordon McGuinness released a mock draft on Monday that had the Dolphins moving up from Pick No. 10 to No. 1 by trading with the New York Giants to secure Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\n“Projected trade: New York Giants send No. 1 overall pick to Miami Dolphins for No. 10, No. 44, a 2027 first-round pick and a 2027 second-round pick,” McGuinness wrote.\n\n“With Tua Tagovailoa benched ahead of the Dolphins’ Week 16 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, it’s obvious that Miami is in the market for a new quarterback. In this mock draft, they get aggressive to move up for one.\n\n“Mendoza recorded a 6.2% big-time throw rate and a 2.3% turnover-worthy play rate this season, which compares well with recent No. 1 overall picks Cam Ward (6.3%, 3.3%) and Caleb Williams (6.2%, 3.6%).”\n\nThe Dolphins will likely be on the lookout for a replacement for Tagovailoa. With the upcoming rookie quarterback draft class not expected to be deep, Miami will need to think outside the box to move up in the draft and find its future signal caller.\n\nWhy Bill Belichick’s Possible Latest Move Signals He Likely Won’t Accept NFL Head Coaching Role This Offseason",

    "fullText": "Daejeon Hana Citizen enjoyed a hugely successful 2025 Hana Bank K League 1 season, finishing second to qualify for the AFC Champions League Elite and setting new club records.\n\nDaejeon finished as runners-up and qualified for the AFC Champions League Elite, so quite a lot went well for the Purples. They found a reliable goalscorer in Joo Min-kyu, they remained mostly consistent throughout the season with no major slumps in form, and they had a good split between their number of home wins (10) and away wins (18).\n\nIt was a milestone year for Citizen, runners-up marks the club's best-ever finish, and since the introduction of the split system in 2012, Daejeon had never finished in the top half of K League 1. The club have also qualified for the AFC Champions League through league positioning for the first time. A total of 65 points matches the club's best at K League 1 level, and 18 wins also matches Citizen's record, but both were set in 2003 in a 44-game season. This means Daejeon have set new points per game and win percentage records of 1.71 points and 47.4%, respectively.\n\nRecruitment can be regarded as a success, too; the summer window in particular, with exactly the right sort of players brought in: a near-enough like-for-like replacement for the injured Victor Bobsin, a right winger to replace Yoon Do-young in Joao Victor, a top class left back to replace the injured Park Kyu-hyun in Lee Myung-jae, and another forward who could make an impact in Hernandes Rodrigues.\n\n[READ: Five teams that had milestone years]\n\nDaejeon struggled to keep clean sheets and sometimes lived a bit dangerously. They have one of the best goalkeepers in the league in Lee Chang-geun, and he consistently proves how good he is because he's kept busy. Nine cleansheets was only enough for joint eighth (with 11th-placed Jeju), with Gangwon and Jeonbuk leading the way in that regard with 15.\n\nDaejeon were the best of the rest, the most in-form team among all who dared to challenge Jeonbuk, but once the Purples fell off top spot, they never looked like returning. It's uncharted territory for the club and for a lot of the players, but they were just unable to pose Jeonbuk any problems, losing to the Green Warriors three times from the four meetings and taking one mere point from them.\n\nDaejeon didn't really have a go-to U22 player this season, with a few different youngsters tried after Yoon Do-young left. A 17-year-old winger, Kim Hyeon-oh, scored on his debut, but finished the season being hooked after 15 minutes. Attacking midfielder Lee Jun-gyu mostly came off the bench to help facilitate a fifth sub but was still able to make 19 appearances, while central midfielder Kim Han-seo got 10 appearances and made the most passes among any U22 player at the club. Kim Han-seo looked the most mature of them all, and nearer to the finished article with his tidy passing and good vision, but has since joined K League 2 newcomers Yongin FC on loan now that the U22 rule has been scrapped in the top flight.\n\n[READ: Is Daejeon a football city?]\n\nEvery year, this has gone to goalkeeper Lee Chang-geun but Joo Min-kyu breaks that tradition this season, offering some insight perhaps into the shift away from relegation worries to top six ambition. Joo was Daejeon's top scorer with a very healthy 14 with three assists. He finished just three goals shy of the Golden Boot winner Pablo Sabbag, and perhaps could have added to his tally had it not been for a shoulder injury curtailing his campaign.\n\nAs any top marksman does, Joo scored plenty of important goals: winners against Suwon FC, Ulsan, Gangwon, and Daegu, as well as goals in tight games that, without them, would have meant points dropped. In short, including match winners, Joo Min-kyu's goals and assists were the difference in Daejeon earning 16 points more.\n\nHonourable mentions must also go to Daejeon's two entrants in the 2025 K League 1 Best XI, full backs Lee Myung-jae and Kim Moon-hwan, and Masatoshi Ishida, whose fall form helped get Daejeon over the line.\n\nJeong Jae-hee had, aside from an injury-shortened 2023, productive seasons for Pohang with 26 goals and eight assists across 92 appearances. But the right winger never seemed to get going in Daejeon colours. He began the season not fully fit and seemed to play catch-up throughout the campaign, and was absent from the match-day squad 12 times. Of his 24 appearances, only two were starts, and he didn't last the full 90 in either of those games. With competition for places somewhat extreme at Daejeon, Jeong may leave for pastures new in 2026, but regardless of where the 31-year-old ends up, he'll need a full pre-season to avoid a repeat of 2025.\n\nDaejeon need to trim their squad but add quality in order to compete on three fronts next year. There are currently four left backs on the club's books and three right backs, and with Gustav Ludwigson and Um Won-sang arriving from Ulsan, one or two too many wingers. They need to have a serious rethink about their recruitment policy because, while quality players came in during this summer and last, maintaining squad harmony is only going to become more difficult with more arrivals.\n\nDaejeon also need to properly replace tactics coach Yoshida Tatsuma, the man said to be the brains behind the system used last year that saw a remarkable turnaround to avoid relegation, and a tweaked version this year that, ultimately, led to the runners-up finish. Hwang Sun-hong fought to keep the Japanese former Kashiwa Reysol manager, but he has returned to J.League with Kyoto Sanga. A coach with a similar CV is who they are after to replace Tatsuma, but this appointment could be make or break for Hwang as, on the surface, he has rebuilt his career and, to a certain extent, his reputation at Daejeon.",

    "fullText": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — England's managing director of men's cricket Rob Key says he will investigate the drinking habits of the England team following reports that their mid-Ashes beach break may have involved over-indulging of alcohol.\n\nEngland lost each of the first three tests to allow Australia to retain the Ashes in just 11 days of on-field action.\n\nThe squad visited the resort town of Noosa on the Sunshine Coach north of Brisbane between the second and third tests, a long-planned part of the itinerary designed to help players relax and unwind on the long tour.\n\nKey, who did not join the players in Noosa, said he had no problem with the break, but would not be happy if he found evidence of over-indulging.\n\n“If there’s things where people are saying that our players went out and drank excessively, then of course we’ll be looking into that,” he said Tuesday in Melbourne, where the fourth test begins Friday.\n\n“Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for an international cricket team is not something that I’d expect to see at any stage and it would be a fault not to look into what happened there. From everything that I’ve heard so far, they actually were pretty well behaved. Very well behaved.”\n\nHe added: “We’ve got enough ways of finding out exactly what happened and everything that I’ve heard so far that they sat down, had lunch, had dinner, didn’t go out late, all of that, had the odd drink. I don’t mind that. If it goes past that, then that’s an issue as far as I’m concerned.\"\n\nKey also said he had previously looked into reports that players had been spotted drinking the night before a match in New Zealand shortly before the Ashes.\n\nA short clip of white-ball captain Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell was shared by a member of the public on social media, said to have been taken while they were out in Wellington before the third one-day international on Nov. 1.\n\n“I didn’t feel like that was worthy of formal warnings, but it was probably worthy of informal ones,” he said.\n\n“I think that was a bit of a wake-up call actually for what they’re going into. I don’t mind players having a glass of wine over dinner. Anything more than that, I think is ridiculous, really.”\n\nAP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket",

    "title": "View From The Away End: Festive Cheer For Sunderland At Brighton",
    "description": "With Christmas around the corner and SAFC fans still basking in the warm afterglow of last week’s derby victory, there was no shortage of festive cheer ahead of this week’s trip to the South Coast for a rare visit to Brighton & Hove Albion.",
    "fullText": "Santa hats and loud Christmas jumpers were the order of the day, and the cloudless blue winter sky matched the jubilant mood on the early Thameslink service from Finsbury Park as we shared stories of how we celebrated Nick Woltemade’s hilarious act of charity.\n\nThe proximity of this game to Christmas and the long journey from the North-East meant that more London Branch members than usual had been able to secure tickets, so plenty of familiar faces could be found in and around the various hostelries of Brighton. After a refuelling stop at Wetherspoons and checking in our bags to our Airbnb, we headed to The Walrus, an unusual establishment that somehow managed to maintain a homely traditional pub atmosphere while being a labyrinthine Aladdin’s Cave.\n\nWith the Amex being an out-of-town stadium, we needed to jump on the service to Falmer in good time. The home fans were among the friendliest I’ve encountered this year, with some of them even joining in our rendition of We All Live in a Gary Rowell World, a terrace favourite that has taken on huge poignancy since the loss of the great man. One lady even commented how much friendlier and likeable our supporters had been than the Mags were when they visited recently. Read into that what you will…\n\nTurning to the matter at hand, fixtures against the Seagulls have been few and far between this side of the millennium, with their rise in the late 2010s coinciding with our spectacular fall from grace, but we faced them now as equals and had no reason to think that this year’s team would be unable to compete despite the well-documented departures for AFCON. Nonetheless, we were relieved to see that Danny Welbeck would be missing out for the home side, and while our line-up obviously took on a different look to usual, having top-quality options such as Rigg, Geertruida, and Adingra to step in is hardly a cause for panic stations.\n\nThis optimism was justified by an excellent first-half performance as we carved out several dangerous moments despite never having any chances that would fall into the “sitter” category. I avoid paying too much heed to stats such as xG, as at best they only ever paint a partial picture of a team’s performance, but it certainly felt that we would be faring well on the “expected” scoreline that seems to be the be-all-and-end-all for so many commentators these days.\n\nBrighton as a club do a lot of things right, and others would do well to take note of their excellent half-time service which allowed us to grab a pint and a snack in time to avoid missing any of the action. Sunderland carried on the second half in much the same vein as the first, as Alderete forced an impressive save from Verbruggen to deny us what would have been a deserved lead. The momentum shifted just after the hour mark, however, with the dangerous Mitoma adding an extra element of unpredictability to the Seagulls’ attack, and while we were never hanging on for dear life, the last twenty minutes or so were a difficult watch at times.\n\nThankfully the full-time whistle blew with our clean sheet intact, and we were able to salute a resilient performance from our current players while also showing our gratitude to Brighton sub Tommy Watson for helping to make it all happen.\n\nBack in the city centre at the Evening Star, we reflected on what has been a remarkable year following Sunderland on the road. 2025 was bookended by two 0-0 draws that couldn’t have been further apart emotionally – from the gut punch of Isidor’s double penalty miss at Turf Moor that seemed like such a hammer blow to our automatic-promotion hopes, to the pride at seeing us match a top Premier League side to maintain our status in the top six at Christmas. There have been a few lows and some unimaginable highs in between, but overall 2025 has to go down as one of the best calendar years supporting this great club.\n\nWith some enticing London away days around the corner in January and the prospect of further additions to this brilliant squad, there is plenty to look forward to as we welcome in 2026. Ha’way the Lads, and a very Merry Christmas.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is reportedly a strong admirer of a ‘utility’ England international who can become a leader.\n\nI’d say that Chelsea still lack some leaders and maturity in their squad, despite some of them finally stepping up a bit now in that department as they get that little bit older.\n\nSo when I see a report of Chelsea potentially adding a ‘leader’ type player to the squad then it will always catch my attenion.\n\nAnd also, Elliot Anderson is one of the best midfielders around right now on current form, and when you are thinking about a player who can literally do it all, he is your guy.\n\nI rate Anderson highly, and Chelsea have now been linked with him a few times recently, but then so is pretty much every big club around. He has become a hugely sought after talent.\n\nElliot Anderson in action for Nottingham Forest.(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nCaught Offside put out a report around Chelsea’s interest in signing new midfielders, and Anderson was mentioned.\n\nThe report says Maresca is a strong admirer of the Nottingham Forest midfielder, valuing his versatility and ability to become the leader of the midfield.\n\nAnderson’s ability to play multiple roles across midfield makes him an appealing “utility” option.\n\nLet’s see if anything comes of that then.\n\nCheck in on our full match report from Chelsea’s 2-2 draw away at Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon where it is safe to say this was very much a game of two halves that could have gone either way come the end.\n\nMeanwhile, it looks like Nicolas Jackson will not be signed permanently by Bayern Munich in the summer but there are a host of other clubs lining up to sign him, as he will not be staying at Chelsea.",

    "description": "“Everything has a time and a place, and it’s time to retire the Shearer song,” writes Mike Stubbs!",
    "fullText": "It’s Christmas 2025, Sunderland are sat sixth in the Premier League with 27 points from 17 games, we have international players away representing their countries in the Africa Cup of Nations, we still have enough top-class players in our squad to draw away to an established Premier League team like Brighton – and our nearest and dearest rivals are four points and five places below us!\n\nIt should be a situation that should fill any Sunderland fan with festive joy. So why, after yesterday’s trip to Brighton, am I a little grumpy?\n\nIt’s something that has been festering with me for a while now, and it came to a head on the South Coast. I joined the train at York to find myself in a carriage full of fellow believers. The group I sat next to had identified a fellow passenger with a moustache, curly hair, and enough of a resemblance to Nick Woltemade that, when he fell asleep after Peterborough, he unwittingly found himself in the middle of a photograph with appreciative SAFC fans.\n\nAs we landed at King’s Cross, I disappeared off to rouse Son No. 2 from his post-Anthony Joshua v Jake Paul slumbers in his uni digs before we rejoined the throng heading for Brighton. It was our first time at the Amex and we watched Chelsea equalise against “the Visitors” in their fanzone before heading for the concourse. With a pie and a pint, we stood watching one of the many TVs that Brighton provide for the entertainment of their visitors, hoping that Chelsea could find a winner.\n\n“Shearer is a w__ker, he wears a w__ker’s hat.”\n\nWhy are we still singing songs about a Mag almost 20 years after he retired?\n\nLove him or hate him, Alan Shearer deserves his place in the list of England’s greatest strikers. His partnership with Teddy Sheringham at Euro 96 made for one of the best summers of football that I have ever experienced.\n\nBut he’s Newcastle through and through. And, as much as I enjoyed his England performances, nothing will beat Tommy Sørensen parrying away his penalty four years later.\n\nThere’s a significant proportion of Sunderland fans who weren’t born before he retired, and a boatload more who will never actually have seen him play other than on a Sky documentary. He’s an increasingly rare pundit on Match of the Day, and the only thing of note is his reticence to analyse Sunderland games.\n\nI haven’t been to St James’ Park but I would love it if Niall Quinn or Kevin Phillips had got so much under their skin that the Barcodes were still singing their names two decades later!\n\nThe bloke is an irrelevance in 2025, or he should be.\n\nNow go back and read the first paragraph of this article again.\n\nSinging about one of “the Visitors’” heroes in this era smacks of an inferiority complex, and one that does our fanbase no credit. We have our own heroes – past and present. Sing about Xhaka, and Nordi, Talbi, Brobbey, Wilson, Eli, Dan Ballard, and roar for Hume and Roefs. Sing Wise Men Say and Gary Rowell’s song.\n\nEverything has a time and a place, and it’s time to retire the Shearer song.\n\nOr, to put it another way – just stop singing about that Mag, FFS!",

    "description": "The Denver Nuggets jumped out to a 19-0 lead in the first five minutes and the Utah Jazz were never able to recover",
    "fullText": "Shortly before the Utah Jazz and Denver Nuggets tipped off on Monday night at Ball Arena, Jazz head coach Will Hardy had a lot of praise for how Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and the Nuggets’ supporting cast plays clean and efficient offense.\n\n“Their offense is so clean and clear on what everyone’s roles are,” Hardy said of the Nuggets. “Jokic and Murray really set the stage for everybody ... They are also an elite cutting team. You can’t get that level of efficiency without the shot profile that is analytically friendly ... They do a great job of cutting and putting pressure on the rim. And those sorts of in-between shots that are necessary in a game, their two best players shoot the majority of those and they are really efficient players.”\n\nAnd then the Nuggets seemingly set out to prove just how right Hardy was.\n\nDenver made easy work of leaping out to a 19-0 start in the first five minutes and then pushed their first-quarter lead to 28 points. The Jazz cut the Nuggets’ lead to 17 in the fourth quarter, but were never able to even get close to crawling out of the hole that was dug in the opening minutes.\n\nAnd speaking of the efficiency of the Nuggets, they shot 52.2% from 3-point range and 50.5% overall. Jokic finished with a calm triple-double of 14 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists through just three quarters, while Murray went 6-of-12 from beyond the arc and scored 27 points on just 16 shots.\n\nIt was Jokic’s league-leading 14th triple-double of the season.\n\nThe Nuggets also had five other players score in double figures (Peyton Watson, Cam Johnson, Tim Hardaway Jr., Bruce Brown and Jonas Valanciunas), turned the ball over just 11 times, got 51 points from the bench and scored 37 points on fast breaks alone.\n\nBut it didn’t so much matter how well the Nuggets played throughout the course of the game — eventually winning 135-112 with all of their starters watching from the bench in the fourth quarter — as the night was over after the first five minutes.\n\n“There’s a responsibility as a starter, and it comes with a territory of, like, you got to be ready to go,” Hardy said. “I’m never going to be the coach that yells, ‘make a shot!’ But it’s part of the business — you’ve got to stand and deliver. The things that we can control are the personnel recognition and the transition defense.\"\n\nThe Jazz fell to 10-18 on the season and have a quick turnaround after the loss in Denver. The team will be back at home at the Delta Center against the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night for their final pre-Christmas game.",

    "fullText": "Draymond Green left Monday night’s win over the Orlando Magic early after he got into an argument with head coach Steve Kerr.\n\nGreen and Kerr were seen in a heated discussion during a timeout in the third quarter of the Warriors’ 120-97 win over the Magic, though it wasn’t clear what that argument was about. It was, though, extremely animated on the bench. At one point, it looked like Moses Moody tried to step in and calm Green down, but he later gave up and sat back down.\n\nEventually, Green walked off the floor and went back to the locker rooms at the Chase Center.\n\nDraymond Green & Steve Kerr exchange words. \n\n(via @shubhydoo)\n\n pic.twitter.com/PEwUkzHNIl\n\n— Hoop Central (@TheHoopCentral) December 23, 2025\n\nThat, Kerr said after the game, was actually Green’s decision. He wasn’t sent there, though Kerr declined to reveal what their tiff was actually about.\n\n“We got into it, obviously … We had it out a little bit, and he made his decision to go back to the locker room to cool off,” Kerr said, via ESPN’s Anthony Slater. “That’s all I’m gonna say about it, everything is private. I’ve got nothing further to add.”\n\nSteve Kerr said Draymond Green chose to go to the locker room after the two had a heated argument during an early third quarter timeout. He wasn’t sent there. Green returned to bench for fourth quarter but Kerr said he wouldn’t have gone back to Green.\n\nFull soundbite pic.twitter.com/SPZvuqteIB\n\n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) December 23, 2025\n\nGreen did return to the Warriors’ bench before the end of the game, but he did not take the floor again. He wasn't going to, Kerr said.\n\n“Well, he left,” Kerr said plainly. “He went back to the locker room.”\n\nGreen finished with nine points and seven rebounds in 18 minutes on Monday night. He’s averaged eight points and six rebounds per game this season, his 14th in the league.\n\nStephen Curry led the Warriors with 26 points in the win, which pushed the team to 15-15 on the season. Jimmy Butler added 21 points, and Moses Moody finished with 20 points. Paolo Banchero led the Magic with 21 points and 12 rebounds in the loss, and Desmond Bane added 20 points. They shot just 7-of-27 from the 3-point line as a group, and now sit at 16-13 on the season.\n\nThough Green has been known to get into some heated altercations throughout his career, he’s appeared to have had a great relationship with Kerr. The Warriors selected Green in the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft, and he’s spent his entire career with the franchise. Kerr took over as the team’s head coach ahead of the 2014-15 campaign, and Green has been a key part of the four championships they’ve won at Golden State.\n\nClearly, Green and Kerr aren't on the same page right now. While Green hasn't spoken on the incident yet, Kerr is, at least publicly, trying to move forward.\n\n“We need Draymond. He’s a champion,” Kerr said. “We’ve been together for a long time … It’s unfortunate what happened, but it happened.”",

His teammates rushed to help him, got him back on his feet, and he was able to play out the remaining minutes.\n\nHis goal to make it 1-1 remained the last of the match, so Mali and Zambia shared the points in Group A.

    "fullText": "It would seem that Antoine Semenyo is one player that Manchester City are eager to sign during the January transfer window. The Bournemouth winger would fill a hole in Pep Guardiola’s squad. City does need a goalscoring winger and that is exactly the type of player that Semenyo is. The Ghana international offers a lot more than just goals with his play but it is clear to see why City are so keen to sign Semenyo.\n\nA new report now indicates that it is now a battle between Manchester City and Manchester United to sign Semenyo in January. City will back themselves to sell their vision to Semenyo to trump what their arch-rivals can offer.\n\nGraeme Bailey has reported for TeamTalk that Liverpool has dropped out of the race to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth. Bailey also reports that Tottenham have shifted their focus to other January transfer targets and is seemingly out of the race to sign Semenyo. As per Graeme Bailey’s report it now seems that it is a battle between Manchester City and Manchester United to sign Semenyo. Graeme Bailey further reports that both clubs are confident of signing one of the top wide men in the Premier League. Based on Graeme Bailey’s report where Semenyo believes he will thrive as a player will dictate where he ends up in January if he does end up leaving Bournemouth.\n\nIf it is now a battle between Manchester City and Manchester United to sign Antoine Semenyo it is now up to City to convince Semenyo that his future lies at City. There is a clear role in Pep Guardiola’s side for Semenyo. City need a player who can ideally slot in on the right wing and contribute goals instantly. Semenyo can do that. He can also slot in on the left wing if and when Jeremy Doku needs a rest. You can see where Semenyo can slot into this City squad. It is now up to the Manchester City hierarchy to make the hard sell to Semenyo.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that Antoine Semenyo isn’t Manchester City’s number-one transfer target for the January transfer window. It now seems that Liverpool and Tottenham are out of the race to sign Semenyo. It looks to be a straight battle between City and United. Manchester City will be confident of convincing Semenyo that his future lies at the Etihad and if they do, it wouldn’t be a surprise to City move for the Ghana international as soon as the January transfer window opens.",

    "title": "After Power Outage, SF Wonders: Can Robot Taxis Handle a Big Earthquake?",
    "description": "City officials have called for a hearing investigating Waymo after the company’s self-driving taxis suffered widespread problems during a power outage.",
    "fullText": "San Francisco officials on Monday called for an investigation into Waymo after its autonomous taxis blocked intersections and snarled traffic during an hourslong power outage over the weekend.\n\nThe meltdown, which led Waymo to temporarily shut down its entire fleet in San Francisco, raised alarms about whether the vehicles might impede evacuations or emergency services during a bigger disaster, such as a major earthquake.\n\n“We haven’t seen a situation before where these Waymos have stalled en masse across the city,” said Bilal Mahmood, a San Francisco supervisor who announced he would hold a hearing examining Waymo’s operations during emergencies. “We want to make sure what we saw this weekend doesn’t happen again.”\n\nSan Francisco is the nation’s epicenter of driverless cars, and Waymos in particular have become ubiquitous in the past year, with the camera-laden white Jaguars seemingly on every block.\n\nWaymo — which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google — arrived in the tech capital in 2023 and now has around 1,000 vehicles roaming its hills and avenues.\n\nAfter initial hesitation, San Franciscans have increasingly grown to rely on the cars, which are no longer just a novelty. Some women feel safer in a driverless car than in one driven by a man, and parents have been known to use them for school pickups.\n\nBut Waymo has had a rough go of it recently. One of its self-driving cars in San Francisco killed a beloved bodega cat in October, causing an uproar. And this weekend’s events sparked even more outrage and debate, as social media feeds were filled with videos showing a string of Waymos blocking streets with their hazard lights flashing.\n\nIt was perhaps the first time Waymo taxis failed on such a wide scale. It was also one of the rare instances, perhaps, where human drivers had a clear advantage over the robots.\n\nSeeing the footage this weekend, many San Franciscans couldn’t help but imagine the Big One, the anticipated and much-feared major temblor. It has been 36 years since the last devastating earthquake knocked out power, toppled buildings and caused gas fires that set homes ablaze in San Francisco.\n\nA fleetwide Waymo failure today could hinder fire trucks, rescue services and other emergency crews, said Jeanine Nicholson, who served as San Francisco’s fire chief for five years until she retired last year.\n\n“They don’t have them programmed for when there’s a power outage, never mind when there’s an earthquake and there’s rubble in the street and all the power is out,” she said. “It is a major, major problem.”\n\n“They’re still building the plane while they’re flying it,” Ms. Nicholson added, “and I think it’s irresponsible.”\n\nMr. Mahmood, who serves on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, an elected body akin to a city council, said that stalled Waymo taxis on Saturday had blocked city fire trucks from quickly reaching a burning PG&E substation, which had been one of the causes of the extended power outage in the city. The San Francisco Fire Department declined to comment on whether Waymo vehicles had hindered the emergency response, as did the mayor’s office.\n\nNo injuries or accidents were reported from the weekend’s Waymo problems, city officials said. On Saturday, after the power outage began, Mayor Daniel Lurie’s office contacted Waymo about the gridlock its cars were contributing to, and the company agreed to suspend services, according to representatives from the mayor’s office and Waymo. Service resumed by Sunday afternoon.\n\nIt remains unknown exactly why the Waymos stalled. Some experts speculated that the vehicles rely on cell service to communicate with remote operators in emergency situations, and that their connections dropped in the outage. Others have said that the company may have purposely shut down the cars because it was too risky to have them navigate through so many dead traffic lights.\n\nIt is not clear that self-driving technology itself was to blame. Elon Musk said on X that Tesla Robotaxis, which provide limited ride-share services in San Francisco, had been unaffected this weekend. (The Tesla service is still required to have a human safety monitor on board.)\n\nWaymo said in a statement that while its vehicles are designed to treat nonfunctional signals as four-way stops, “the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion.”\n\nThe company added, “We are focused on rapidly integrating the lessons learned from this event.”\n\nMarcy Fraser, president of the San Francisco Fire Commission, defended Waymo. She finds the automatic vehicles more cautious than human drivers, who she thinks make more mistakes than robot taxis. Even on Saturday, she said, she saw people blasting through intersections where stop lights had gone out.\n\n“That’s less safe, I think, than just stopping,” Ms. Fraser said. “But very disappointing, I’m sure, for the company.”\n\nWhile Mr. Mahmood called for a hearing, it is not clear what impact the city’s review would have. The state regulates autonomous vehicles in California, not the cities in which they operate. That has sometimes left local officials feeling as though they have little control.\n\nMayor Lurie has been a prominent supporter of Waymo services. “Waymo is incredibly safe,” he said recently when asked about the cat that was run over by a Waymo taxi. “It’s safer than you or I getting behind a wheel.”\n\nMatthew Wansley, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law who specializes in emerging automotive technologies, said he hoped that state regulators were asking questions about what happened in San Francisco. Terrie Prosper, a spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission, which has oversight authority, said on Monday that the agency was “looking into specifics.”\n\nIn general, Mr. Wansley said, self-driving cars are safer than human drivers, but automated taxis come with novel risks that must be considered, particularly as Waymo looks to scale up in cities nationwide. Waymo currently has taxi operations similar to its San Francisco service in Los Angeles and Phoenix and provides rides through an Uber partnership in Atlanta and Austin, Texas.\n\nRegulators must think about how the cars will fare in storms, earthquakes, blackouts and more, Mr. Wansley said.\n\n“This is not the last time this is going to happen,” he said. “Waymo has a promising safety record when it comes to avoiding collisions. But of course, safety is about more than avoiding collisions, as the weekend illustrates really clearly.”\n\nHeather Knight contributed reporting, and Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.",

While we have taken measures to limit undesirable training data and outputs, depending on the features that you choose to use, the Service could produce output that is not appropriate for all ages. For instance, if users choose certain features or choose to input suggestive or coarse language, Grok may respond with some dialogue that may involve coarse language, crude humor, sexual situations, or violence. We urge parents to exercise care in monitoring the use of Grok by their teenagers. Moreover, parents or guardians who choose to use certain features of Grok to aid in their interactions with their children, including regarding educational, enlightening, or entertaining discussions they have with their children, must make use of the relevant data controls in the Settings provided in the Grok apps to select the appropriate features and limitations for their needs.\n\nGrok works by using advanced algorithms to understand and respond to your prompts. When you submit a prompt or search query, Grok interprets your words and other inputs based on natural language processing and patterns from its training data.\n\nGrok has a unique feature that allows it to search public X posts and perform real-time web searches, allowing it to respond with up-to-date information and insights on a wide range of topics. You can also ask Grok to respond in the conversational style of your choosing. Plus, you can help improve Grok by rating its responses and submitting the reason why you believe a Grok response needs addressing.\n\nYou can interact with Grok by typing or, on iOS devices (and Android devices soon), speaking with Grok so that Grok speaks to you with its voice.

We do ask that you attribute the generated work to Grok as provided in xAI’s Brand Guidelines available on xAI’s legal website.\n\nGrok has primarily been pre-trained on a large corpus of publicly available information, including raw web page data, metadata extracts, and text extracts from the Internet. This data helps Grok learn about associations between words and updates its model weights to support natural language processing. In other words, the training data helps Grok learn about language and how to understand queries and respond to them in ways that humans can comprehend. Importantly, this training refines the model's internal language structures. Once the training is done, the model does not reference or access the pre-training data.\n\nBefore using the training data, we apply quality filters and remove information that we do not want our models to learn from, such as violent content. We also apply security testing and evaluation measures. While Grok's training data may incidentally include personal information that is publicly available (for example, information about politicians, celebrities, or other public figures), xAI takes steps to minimize the processing of personal and sensitive data for training purposes. For clarity, we do not actively seek out personal information to train our models or use personal information to build individual profiles.\n\nOn occasion, Grok may provide inaccurate or inappropriate information. Because Grok has been trained on publicly available information, which may sometimes include misleading or factually inaccurate information, Grok may at times include in its responses misleading or factually incorrect information based upon that public information. Grok may also reflect positive or negative views of politicians, celebrities, and other public figures. Also, because artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving and is probabilistic in nature, Grok may therefore sometimes generate responses that contain “hallucinations,” or that otherwise may not be suitable for your intended purpose. You should carefully consider and verify Grok's responses before using them.\n\nWe constantly work to improve Grok. If you have feedback regarding a Grok response, we encourage you to send it to us.\n\nxAI may use automated content classifiers and safety tools to better understand how our services are used and to ensure our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy are not being violated.\n\nA limited number of our authorized personnel may review your conversations with Grok for specific business purposes, including improving model performance, investigating security incidents and potential misuse of our services, and complying with our legal obligations. \n\nWe believe that everyone (aged 13 and above) should be free to use our services in a way that suits their needs, so long as they comply with the law, don't harm themselves or others, and respect our guardrails. When using Grok, you must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy and the applicable Terms of Service for Consumers or Enterprise.\n\nWe may use your content and interactions with Grok (e.g., prompts, searches, and other materials you submit) along with Grok's responses to train our models. Specifically, this information helps our models better understand human language and communication and therefore ultimately provide more accurate, relevant, and engaging responses. It also helps boost the capabilities and safety of our models. You control whether your data is used for training Grok. The section below, “How do I select whether my content is used for model training,” explains how to control it.\n\nTo protect your privacy, please do not share any personal or sensitive information in your questions to Grok.\n\nWhen using Private Chat, where available, your content and interactions are not used for model training.

    "title": "The AI History That Explains Fears of a Bubble",
    "description": "The history of AI shows how setting evaluation standards fueled progress. But today's LLMs are asked to do tasks without clear benchmarks.",
    "fullText": "Concerns among some investors are mounting that the AI sector, which has singlehandedly prevented the economy from sliding into recession, has become an unsustainable bubble. Nvidia, the main supplier of chips used in AI, became the first company worth $5 trillion dollars. Meanwhile, OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has yet to make a profit and is burning through billions of investment dollars per year. Still, financiers and venture capitalists continue to pour money into OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI startups. Their bet is that AI will transform every sector of the economy and, as happened to the typists and switchboard operators of yesteryear, replace jobs with technology.\n\nYet, there are reasons to be concerned that this bet may not pay off. For the past three decades, AI research has been organized around making improvements on narrowly-specified tasks like speech recognition. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Claude, however, AI agents are increasingly being asked to do tasks without clear methods for measuring improvement.\n\nTake for example the seemingly mundane task of creating a PowerPoint presentation. What makes a good presentation? We may be able to point to best practices, but the “ideal” slideshow depends on creative processes, expert judgments, pacing, narrative sense, and subjective tastes that are all highly contextual. Annual review presentations differ from start-up pitches and project updates. You know a good presentation when you see it—and a bad one when it flops. But the standardized tests that the field currently uses to evaluate AI cannot capture the above qualities.\n\nThis may seem like a minor problem, but crises of evaluation have contributed to historical AI busts. And without accurate measures of how good AI really is, it’s hard to know whether we’re headed towards another one now.\n\nThe birth of AI is often traced back to a small workshop at Dartmouth in 1956 that brought together computer scientists, psychologists, and others with a shared interest in mimicking human intelligence in machines. The field quickly found a powerful benefactor in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), an agency within the Department of Defense charged with maintaining technological supremacy during the Cold War. To avoid falling behind in the science race, DARPA lavished AI researchers at universities and private firms with significant no-strings-attached grants over the next 40 years.\n\nThese first decades of the field were defined by peaks of excitement, as new technologies were invented, followed by valleys of disappointment, as they failed to evolve into useful applications. During the 1980s, this cycle was spurred by an AI technology called \"expert systems,\" which promised to build machines with the intelligence of professionals like doctors and financial planners. Under the hood, these programs encoded human expertise in formal rules: if the patient has a fever and a rash, then test for measles.\n\nExpert systems attracted significant attention and investment from industry based on early successes like automating loan applications. But this optimism was largely fueled by hype, rather than rigorous testing. In practice, these expert systems tended to make strange and sometimes disastrous mistakes when challenged with more complex tasks. During one humorous showcase, an expert system suggested a man’s infection might have been caused by a prior amniocentesis (a procedure performed on pregnant women). It turned out researchers had forgotten to add a rule for gender.\n\nAt the time, fiery AI critic Hubert Dreyfus described these failures as the “fallacy of the first step,” arguing that equating expert systems with progress toward real intelligence was like “claiming that the first primate to climb a tree was taking a first step towards flight to the moon.” The problem was that, as tasks became more complicated, the number of rules needed for every possible case mushroomed. Like moving from tic-tac-toe to checkers to chess, the number of possibilities doesn’t merely increase, it explodes exponentially.\n\nWhen it became apparent that expert systems could not climb further, AI research entered a so-called “AI Winter” in the late 1980s. Grants dried up, companies shut down, and AI became a dirty word.\n\nIn the aftermath, DARPA re-evaluated its AI funding strategy. Rather than give no-strings-attached grants, government program managers began conditioning awards on attaining the highest score on a standardized test they called a “benchmark.” In contrast to complex problems like medical diagnosis, benchmarks focused on bite-sized tasks that were attainable and of immediate commercial and military value. They also used quantitative metrics to verify results. Can your system accurately translate this sentence from Russian to English, transcribe this audio snippet, or digitize letters in these documents? Researchers had to do more than make flashy claims based on promising but incomplete technologies. To get funded, they had to deliver concrete evidence of improvements on the benchmarks.\n\nThese benchmark competitions unified an unruly field by funneling AI researchers towards common problems. Instead of each research group choosing its own projects, DARPA shaped the collective agenda of the field by funding researchers to work on specific tasks like digit recognition or speech-to-text. The competitive nature of the new funding regime meant that AI orientations that were less successful on the benchmarks were crowded out. For example, the very first benchmark competition demonstrated that “machine learning” algorithms that can learn from data dominated the hand-crafted, rule-based approaches of the past.\n\nPublic leaderboards were soon erected to provide real-time feedback on which algorithms held the current highest scores on each benchmark, allowing researchers to learn from past successes. As tasks were solved, more complex tasks were put in their place. Translating words led to translating paragraphs, and eventually multiple languages. Digit recognition gave way to object recognition in images, then videos.\n\nIn the early 2010s, progress accelerated after benchmarks convinced researchers to go all in on one machine-learning approach inspired by the human brain, called artificial neural networks or “deep learning,” which now underpins today’s generative AI. Within a couple of years speech-to-text algorithms were powering modern AI assistants, and tumor recognition algorithms began to outperform radiologists on some cancers. Benchmarking had seemingly cracked the first step toward usable AI in everyday life.\n\nPut simply, the tasks we now seek to automate no longer have clear benchmarks. There is no “correct” PowerPoint, marketing campaign, scientific hypothesis, or poem. Unlike object recognition where there is a right or wrong answer, these are complex, creative, multi-dimensional, and process-based problems, and even the hardest benchmarks simply cannot objectively measure progress.\n\nAs a result, new models of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot are evaluated as much by \"vibe tests\" as concrete benchmarks. We're currently caught between two inadequate approaches: old-style benchmarks that measure narrow capabilities precisely, and qualitative assessments that try to capture the practical capacities of these systems, but cannot produce clear, quantitative evidence of progress. Researchers are exploring new evaluation systems that bridge these perspectives, but this is a really hard problem.\n\nCurrent investments assume significant automation will arrive in the next three to five years. But without reliable evaluation methods, we cannot know whether LLM-based technologies are leading us toward genuine automation or repeating Dreyfus' fallacy, taking the first step on a dead-end path. This is the difference between the infrastructure of the future and a bubble. Right now, it’s difficult to tell which one we're building.\n\nBernard Koch is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Chicago who studies how evaluation shapes science, technology, and culture.

    "description": "Structured generation for LLM tool use highlights the value of compact DSL intermediate representations (IRs) that can be emitted directly and parsed deterministically. This paper introduces axial grammar: linear token sequences that recover multi-dimensional structure from the placement of rank-specific separator tokens. A single left-to-right pass assigns each token a coordinate in an n-dimensional grid, enabling deterministic parsing without parentheses or clause-heavy surface syntax. This grammar is instantiated in Memelang, a compact query language intended as an LLM-emittable IR whose fixed coordinate roles map directly to table/column/value slots. Memelang supports coordinate-stable relative references, parse-time variable binding, and implicit context carry-forward to reduce repetition in LLM-produced queries.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nFor many people, being retired is almost synonymous with being frugal. With less control over your monthly income, it’s natural that you might become more focused on controlling expenses.\n\nIn a recent survey from the Senior Citizens League, an overwhelming 94% of respondents said that the 2025 cost-of-living adjustment to Social Security wasn’t enough to keep up with their actual expenses (1).\n\nWhat’s more, 52% of American seniors on Social Security said they were cutting back on discretionary items like dining out and travel due to the cost of living outpacing their benefits, according to a Nationwide survey (2). More than 30% said they were even cutting back on essentials such as groceries and medication.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nHowever, there is one big expense that rarely gets mentioned and could be one of the easiest to cut without impacting your lifestyle: investment fees.\n\nHere’s why this silent drag on your finances could be draining thousands of dollars from your nest egg over a 30-year investment horizon, especially if you’re doing well for yourself.\n\nPaying a relatively high fee for investment advice or actively managed funds could seem like a savvy move on paper, especially if the targeted returns outpace the price.\n\nFirst, the fees usually sound deceptively low. The average expense ratio for all active U.S. funds was 1% in 2024, according to Morningstar (3).\n\nMeanwhile, professional financial advisors usually charge a percentage of assets under management (AUM), often ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, according to Yahoo Finance (4).\n\nPaying 1% for a professional to execute sophisticated strategies that involve options or exotic assets like private credit could seem justified. But the after-fee performance of many of these funds and strategies can fail to live up to the hype.\n\nLegendary investors like Warren Buffett echo this sentiment.\n\n“Costs really matter in investments,” Buffett said during an interview with CNBC in 2017 (5).\n\n“If returns are going to be 7 or 8 percent and you’re paying 1 percent for fees, that makes an enormous difference in how much money you’re going to have in retirement.”",

    "fullText": "Tamale season in San Antonio is serious business. So serious, in fact, that one popular spot in the Alamo City hires security to help manage the inevitably long lines throughout the holiday months.\n\nA TikTok posted by Arianna Esquivel on Sunday, December 21, shows a uniformed Bexar County Sheriff's Office deputy outside Delia's on San Antonio's Northwest Side. In the video, the deputy lays out some ground rules for folks lining up outside, telling them that the restaurant will only be open for pre-order pick-up, except for extra tamales being sold to the general public \"on a very limited basis.\"\n\n\"That being said, there is no guarantee on ... what you will get,\" he said. \"You are standing here at your own risk. There is a chance you may or may not get tamales.\"\n\nIt seems that the deputy's presence was a precaution rather than a reaction to any incident at the restaurant. A spokesperson for the Bexar County Sheriff's Office told MySA in an email that \"the deputy was working off-duty employment, contracted and paid by the restaurant, to provide security due to an increased number of customers during the holiday season.\"\n\nEsquivel captioned the video, which racked up more than 13,000 views in less than a day, \"We gotta do things better next year! Things were very crazy at Delia's this season.\" In a DM, Esquivel told MySA she waited in line for about four hours. She said she had not preordered, \"but the truth is, even if you did preorder, you still had to wait in line to pickup/pay, and Delia's was still messing up orders even though people ordered ahead of time.\"\n\nShe's not the first to notice the security presence. In a post from November on the r/sanantonio subreddit, one local made their first visit to Delia's (a chain from the RGV) this season and was shocked by the wait times and the guards.\n\n\"I called in my order yesterday for pickup today. The lady said she only had 3:00 and 5:00 [p.m.] pickups left. That was my first hint this would not going to be a normal carryout experience,\" user free-advice wrote. When it came time to pick up the order, the user was surprised there were security guards at the restaurant, writing, \"You thought we were going to do serious tamale business without guarded security? This place had several security guards/cops standing around keeping things in order.\"\n\nContinuing, free-advice said, \"I went inside and got in line. There was another security guard/cop inside (good guy, friendly) and I was like, 'yo this is nuts, security guards for tamales what is going on here?' He was like, 'lol I know, come back at Christmas that line of cars will be miles long!'\"\n\nSuffice to say, pulling off a stress-free tamale season order is not for the weak. MySA reached out to Delia's for comment via email and by phone, but did not hear back at the time of publication.\n\nThis article originally published at 'Gotta do things better': Popular San Antonio tamale spot is turning heads.",

    "description": "Leafy greens now cause more outbreaks than hamburgers as contamination patterns shift over decades.",
    "fullText": "Even foods most Americans consider “healthy” can pose serious foodborne illness risks, experts warn — and several say salads, sprouts and deli meats are among the everyday items they personally refuse to eat.\n\nOne Seattle attorney who has spent decades litigating some of the country’s worst foodborne illness outbreaks recently told The Washington Post that his well-done burger and steak order has prompted chefs to come out and ask what’s wrong with him.\n\n“I explain what I do for a living,” Bill Marler told the outlet. “It’s an occupational hazard.”\n\nHe said he no longer touches bagged salads, fruit cups or trays, deli meats, ready-to-eat meals and raw sprouts — which are often served raw on sandwiches, salads and wraps.\n\nHe said the items have been repeatedly tied to cross-contamination and major Listeria, E. coli and Salmonella outbreaks.\n\nWhile most diners view greens as a safe choice, Marler said he avoids them entirely when eating out.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Marler for further comment — but several other experts said they agree. They added that the riskiest foods to eat may not be the ones consumers expect.\n\nThe list of problematic items reflects how outbreak patterns have shifted over time, Bryan Quoc Le, a food scientist with Mendocino Food Consulting in California, told Fox News Digital.\n\n“Ground beef risks have decreased due to testing and cooking requirements, while leafy greens lack a ‘heat step’ and are known to become contaminated earlier in the supply chain, where controls are harder to enforce,” Le said.\n\nLeafy greens are also centrally processed, mixed in huge batches and shipped across the country.\n\nThat likely makes them the highest current risk, he noted. “A single contamination event can affect many people before it’s detected,” he said.\n\nIn the 1990s, hamburgers were seen as the biggest food safety threat, especially after a 1993 E. coli outbreak sent more than 170 people to the hospital and killed four children.\n\nBut after stricter regulations and major safety improvements, illnesses linked to burgers dropped sharply, according to Jason Reese, an Indiana-based food safety expert and personal injury attorney who specializes in these cases.\n\nToday, Reese noted, the danger has flipped. Lettuce and other leafy greens now cause far more outbreaks than hamburgers, largely because they’re grown near cattle operations, can be contaminated by irrigation water and are eaten raw with no cooking steps to kill pathogens.\n\n“The lettuce on top of those burgers is the culprit,” Reese told Fox News Digital.\n\nHe said he never eats salad or bagged lettuce while dining out.\n\n“Seeing the victims I’ve represented go into kidney failure and need dialysis for life just from one restaurant salad is eye-opening.”\n\n“Most Americans don’t seem to think it will happen to them,” Reese added. “Yet the numbers don’t lie.”\n\nAbout 48 million Americans get sick from foodborne illnesses each year — roughly 1 in 6 people — according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), leading to an estimated 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths.\n\nThe agency notes the US food supply remains among the world’s safest, yet produce accounts for a significant share of cases, particularly norovirus, the nation’s leading foodborne illness.\n\nThe risk for young children, pregnant women, the elderly and immunocompromised people, is especially not “worth the gamble,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey dietitian and former food safety inspector Tina Marinaccio agreed.\n\n“Most Americans are completely clueless about what happens to their food before it gets to their plates,” she told Fox News Digital.\n\nBut Marinaccio disagreed with Marler’s opinion that steaks must be cooked well-done.\n\n“If you’re not immunocompromised or pregnant, get the rare steak,” she said.\n\nE. coli would be killed on the surface during normal cooking, she said.\n\nShe added that the real concern is ground beef, where bacteria can be mixed throughout the meat and must reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit to be safe.\n\nDespite the dangers, experts stress that many foodborne illnesses are preventable.\n\nMarinaccio said proper handwashing and better glove training are essential, as poor hygiene is one of the most common sources of contamination.\n\nLe added that fully cooking meats, treating bagged salads as higher-risk foods and cutting produce at home can significantly reduce the chances of getting sick.",

    "description": "It has not been determined whether Pratt & Whitney engines had any role in the plane crash that killed seven, including retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle.",
    "fullText": "The plane that crashed last week in North Carolina, killing retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and the six other people on board, had engines made by Connecticut-headquartered Pratt & Whitney, according to federal investigators.\n\nThe Cessna 550 that crashed upon landing last Thursday at the regional airport in Statesville, North Carolina, had Pratt engines that were manufactured in Canada, a spokesperson for the National Transportation Safety Board said this week. Technical advisers from the company are assisting the agency's investigation of the crash, the spokesperson added.\n\n\"NTSB investigators are on scene documenting the wreckage, collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses,\" states an update on the crash investigation posted on NTSB's website. \"All aspects of this accident remain under investigation.\"\n\nA preliminary report is expected within 30 days of the crash. The preliminary report will \"contain factual information gathered during the initial phase of the investigation. A probable cause of the crash and any contributing factors will come in the final report, which is expected in 12 to 24 months,\" the update added.\n\nPratt & Whitney officials declined to comment on the crash and the investigation.\n\nWhile Pratt & Whitney is headquartered in East Hartford, it has a significant presence north of the border, including the Pratt & Whitney Canada head office and main manufacturing facility in Longueuil, Quebec.\n\nInvestigators are trying to figure out why the Cessna 550 tried to return right after takeoff to the Statesville airport, which is about 45 miles north of Charlotte. The plane erupted into a large fire when it hit the ground, about a third of a mile from the airport's runway.\n\nIn addition to the 55-year-old Biffle, his wife, five-year-old son, 14-year-old daughter, and three other people were killed in the crash, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said.\n\nInvestigators have not yet determined the lead pilot. Biffle was one of three people on board with a pilot's license.\n\nA cockpit voice recorder has been recovered, a remnant of the plane that could provide important information. Investigators are not aware of any emergency calls from the jet, NTSB member Michael Graham said at a news conference last Friday.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether the Cessna 550's engines had any role in the crash, there have been several non-fatal aviation incidents involving issues with Pratt engines in the past few years. Among them, in February 2021, a Boeing 777-200 operated by United Airlines that was bound for Hawaii returned safely to Denver International Airport, after experiencing \"right-engine failure shortly after takeoff,\" according to Federal Aviation Administration officials.\n\nPratt's engines have also faced scrutiny related to the discovery in 2023 of a rare condition in powder metal used in certain parts, affecting the company's Geared Turbofan fleet. For 2023, Pratt incurred a pre-tax charge of $2.9 billion, which reflected its anticipation of increased aircraft groundings, its expectation of compensation to customers for the disruption, as well as maintenance costs resulting from increased inspections and shop visits.\n\nThis article contains reporting from The Associated Press.\n\nThis article originally published at Plane crash that killed NASCAR's Biffle, six others had engines made by CT-headquartered Pratt & Whitney.",

    "fullText": "Russia has accused Ukraine of carrying out a number of high-profile attacks against prominent Russians since Moscow invaded its neighbor nearly four years ago.\n\nWhile Kyiv has hinted at its involvement in some cases, Ukrainian officials have often stopped short of publicly claiming responsibility. In other cases, they have denied all involvement.\n\nOn Monday, a Russian general was killed by a car bomb in Moscow, and investigators say they are looking into whether Ukraine was behind the attack. Ukraine has not yet commented on the death of Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov.\n\nOther attacks that Russia has blamed on Ukraine include:\n\nKirillov, head of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed alongside his assistant, Ilya Polikarpov, when a bomb planted on a scooter exploded outside an apartment building in Moscow in December 2024.\n\nKirillov had been charged in absentia a day earlier by Ukraine’s Security Service, the SBU, with ”ordering the use of banned chemical weapons against Ukraine’s Defense Forces.” The SBU later claimed responsibility for the attack. An Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on the security service’s behalf.\n\nMoskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department of the General Staff, was killed in April 2025. A bomb had been placed underneath his car, which was parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow.\n\nSeveral days after the attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement that the country’s Foreign Intelligence Service had informed him of the “elimination of senior command personnel of Russia’s armed forces,” but gave no further details.\n\nA Russian man who previously lived in Ukraine pleaded guilty to carrying out the attack and said that he had been paid by Ukraine's security services.\n\nRzhitsky, a former submarine commander, was gunned down in July 2023 while jogging in Krasnodar, Russia.\n\nUkrainian media reported that Rzhitsky was one of six submarine commanders able to launch the long-range missiles that hit Vinnytsia, Ukraine, a year earlier, killing 23 people and wounding over 100.\n\nWhen he died, Rzhitsky was deputy head of a military mobilization office in Krasnodar.\n\nKyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry’s main intelligence directorate, denied Kyiv’s involvement in the death. However, the agency also released details about the killing, including the time of the attack and the number of shots fired. A dual Russian-Ukrainian citizen was convicted in the killing in October 2024.\n\nPrilepin, a nationalist Russian writer, narrowly avoided death in a car bombing in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region in May 2023. His driver was killed, while Prilepin was hospitalized with broken bones, bruised lungs and other injuries.\n\nPrilepin, known for his support of the war, was sanctioned by the European Union.\n\nA Ukrainian was found guilty of the attack in a Russian court and sentenced to life imprisonment. Russia’s Investigative Committee accused him of working on orders from Kyiv.\n\nIn an interview with Ukrainian journalists in March 2024, SBU chief Lt. Gen. Vasyl Maliuk declined to take responsibility for the attack, but said he could provide some details, such as Prilepin's injuries.\n\nTatarsky, a military blogger, was killed in April 2023 when a bomb tore through a cafe in central St Petersburg where he had been speaking.\n\nTatarsky supported the war in Ukraine and filed regular reports from the front for his Telegram followers.\n\nDarya Trepova was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to 27 years in prison after she was seen on camera presenting a small statue to Tatarsky that exploded shortly afterward. Trepova testified she didn’t know the gift contained a bomb.\n\nIn the March 2024 interview, SBU chief Maliuk also declined to take responsibility for Tatarsky's death, but describing the blogger as a mouthpiece for Russia who had \"paid a karmic price before the Ukrainian people.” He also provided details on the bomb that killed Tatarsky.\n\nKyva, a Ukrainian lawmaker who fled to Russia shortly after the full-scale invasion, was found dead near Moscow in December 2023 with a gunshot wound to the head.\n\nA controversial political figure in Ukraine before the war, Kyva often appeared on pro-Kremlin TV talk shows. A month before his death, a Ukrainian court found him guilty in absentia of treason and sentenced him to 14 years in prison.\n\nRussia’s state Investigative Committee accused an Armenian-born businessman of passing on details about Kyva’s movements to the SBU, state news agency Tass said. However, no charges have been brought directly related to the killing.\n\nAndriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said after Kyva’s death that “the same fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine,” but did not say who was behind the killing.\n\nDugina was killed in August 2022 when a remote-controlled bomb planted in her SUV blew up as she drove on Moscow’s outskirts.\n\nHer father, Alexander Dugin, was widely believed to be the intended target. The philosopher, writer and political theorist is an ardent supporter of the war.\n\nUkraine denied responsibility for the attack, with Zelenskyy saying Dugina was “not our responsibility\" and Kyiv was \"not interested in her.”\n\nRussia’s Federal Security Agency, the FSB, publicly identified two Ukrainian citizens as suspects, but said they had escaped abroad.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "It won’t come as any surprise to learn that millions of Americans are trying to put money away for retirement, with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, the number of people behind is shockingly high, putting millions at risk of not enjoying their retirement years.\n\n58.4% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement.\n\nOnly 7.2% of Americans have saved $500,000 or more for retirement.\n\nIf you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nAccording to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, more than 50% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement. This is a big concern, especially considering how shocking it is that a much smaller number have more than $500,000 tucked away for retirement.\n\nWhen you look at the data breakdown provided by the research, there is no question that it will shock people of all income and savings levels. According to the study, it found the following amounts are currently in American’s retirement accounts:\n\n$1 million to $4.99 million: 3.1%\n\nGiven these numbers, it’s essential to consider how you can increase your retirement savings.\n\nWhen the time comes, you should sit down with your spouse or a financial advisor and consider how much you can save immediately. This would include your current income level, expenses, lifestyle choices, etc.\n\nKnowing your financial position, you can consider maximizing savings without entirely sacrificing your quality of life. This might include creating a new budget focused on reducing discretionary spending that can be put into savings instead.\n\nAs you look at what kind of financial injection you need to move yourself from one savings level to the next, you must consider what number you really need. As a general rule of thumb, you want to put aside around 70-80% of your pre-retirement income for every year you consider not working. This could mean establishing a baseline where you put 10%, 20%, or even 30% of your net income annually into a retirement account.\n\nThis is understandably a not-so-insignificant amount of money, which goes back to creating a new budget and looking at where you can cut out unnecessary spending. You should try setting up savings benchmarks for different ages so you know how you are progressing. In other words, turning 30 means you want X dollars put aside. By the time you turn 40, you want Y dollars set aside, and so on.",

    "fullText": "Questions about Sherrone Moore’s judgment and mental state had persisted long before the Michigan head football coach was arrested after he allegedly broke into the home of a female football staff member and threatened suicide while holding butter knives and a pair of scissors.\n\nAn investigation from The Athletic published Monday revealed numerous red flags — including exchanges with women on Instagram beginning in 2020 and as recently as last month — that preceded the arrest and the firing, with cause, over what the school said was an “inappropriate relationship with a staff member.”\n\nThe Athletic spoke with five women who said they had strange or uncomfortable exchanges with Moore on social media. These interactions were raised to university officials by fall 2024 — early in his first year as head coach — two people briefed on the matter told The Athletic. The behavior was not seen to be criminal and was not known to involve school employees, according to the report, but it might have hinted at deeper issues.\n\n“It was not sexual harassment,” one official told The Athletic. “It was propriety, ‘Are you an idiot?’ kind of stuff.”\n\nMoore, who is a married father of three, reportedly reached out to the women through Instagram by direct messaging or “liking” a story they posted. According to one woman, Moore asked if he could fly her in to Michigan to see him. She asked about the expectations associated with the request and whether she would be “holed up in some hotel?”\n\n“I guess we will have to see ! I would say yes but you would also have a driver haha,” Moore reportedly wrote.\n\n“We will go into that detail later,” he wrote.\n\nIn his most recent known interactions with women on Instagram, Moore reportedly reached out to one woman shortly before beating Purdue on Nov. 1. The woman, who had no connections to the Michigan program, according to The Athletic, said she replied to his hand-waving emoji with a hello.\n\nMichigan coach’s bleary-eyed mugshot emerges after his shocking firing, arrest\n\nDisgraced ex-University of Michigan coach Sherrone Moore had ‘long history’ of abusing mistress, her lawyer alleges\n\nMichigan football coach jailed on suspicion of assault after shocking firing over ‘inappropriate relationship’\n\nInside Michigan coach’s ‘strange’ behavior before his firing for ‘inappropriate’ relationship with staffer, shocking arrest\n\nMichigan fires head coach for ‘inappropriate relationship’ in college football bombshell\n\nShortly after the victory, Moore reached out again to the woman, who at first could not believe it was Moore and then congratulated him. Two days later, he reportedly put a fire emoji on a story that featured her on a stairmaster at the gym.\n\nThese interactions might have served as warning signs. Further concerns were raised concerning Moore’s mental state, according to the report, as he would break down sobbing in staff meetings and lash out at other coaches, program sources told The Athletic. In anoother incident, Moore reportedly was seen eavesdropping on closed-door meetings inside the Michigan football facility.\n\nUltimately, it was the alleged relationship with a staffer that prompted his downfall. According to the report, an anonymous tip given to the university’s human resources department led first to an inquiry and then the hiring of the law firm Jenner & Block to conduct an external investigation into Moore and the relationship.\n\nAfter the arrest, Moore told police the relationship had existed for about two years, dating to his days as an assistant. According to The Athletic, one program source remembered seeing Moore’s car in the staffer’s apartment complex late at night.\n\nMoore and the staffer also were spotted at a Michigan lacrosse game in spring 2024. According to The Athletic, Moore grew angry when a member of the Michigan staff warned him about the video of the two at the game and the appearance of impropriety.",

According to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has announced a bold plan for the Navy to build a new, large warship that he is calling a “battleship” as part of a larger vision to create a \"Golden Fleet.\"\n\n“They’ll be the fastest, the biggest, and by far 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,” Trump claimed during the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nAccording to Trump, the ship, the first of which will be named the USS Defiant, will be longer and larger than the World War II-era Iowa-class battleships and will be armed with hypersonic missiles, nuclear cruise missiles, rail guns, and high-powered lasers — all technologies that are in various stages of development by the Navy.\n\nThe announcement comes just a month after the Navy scrapped its plans to build a new, small warship, citing growing delays and cost overruns, deciding instead to go with a modified version of a Coast Guard cutter that was being produced until recently. The sea service has also failed to build its other newly designed ships, like the new Ford-class aircraft carrier and Columbia-class submarines, on time and on budget.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy has struggled to field some of the technologies Trump says will be aboard the new ship.\n\nThe Navy spent hundreds of millions of dollars and more than 15 years trying to field a railgun aboard a ship before finally abandoning the effort in 2021.\n\nLaser technology has seen more success in making its way onto Navy ships in recent years, but its employment is still limited. One system that is designed to blind or disable drone sensors is now aboard eight destroyers after spending eight years in development.\n\nDeveloping nuclear cruise missile capabilities or deploying them on ships may also violate non-proliferation treaties that the U.S. has signed with Russia.\n\nA U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing plans, told The Associated Press that design efforts are now underway for the new ship and construction is planned to begin in the early 2030s.\n\nBoth Trump and Navy Secretary John Phelan spoke about the new Trump-class warship as a spiritual successor to the battleships of the 20th century, but historically that term has referred to a very specific type of ship — a large, heavily armored vessel armed with massive guns designed to bombard other ships or targets ashore.\n\nThis type of ship was at the height of prominence during World War II, and the largest of the U.S. battleships, the Iowa-class, were roughly 60,000 tons. But after World War II, the battleship's role in modern fleets diminished rapidly in favor of aircraft carriers and long-range missiles. The U.S. Navy did modernize four Iowa-class battleships in the 1980s by adding cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, along with modern radars, but by the 1990s all four were decommissioned.\n\nAccording to a newly created website for the “Golden Fleet,” this new “guided missile battleship” is set to be roughly the same size as Iowa-class battleships but only weigh about half as much, around 35,000 tons, and have far smaller crews — between 650 and 850 sailors.\n\nIts primary weapons will also be missiles, not large naval guns.\n\nTrump has long held strong opinions on specific aspects of the Navy’s fleet, sometimes with a view toward keeping older technology instead of modernizing.\n\nDuring his first term, he unsuccessfully called for the return to steam-powered catapults to launch jets from the Navy’s newest aircraft carriers instead of the more modern electromagnetic system.\n\nHe has also complained to Phelan about the look of the Navy’s destroyers and decried Navy ships being covered in rust.\n\nPhelan told senators at his confirmation hearing that Trump \"has texted me numerous times very late at night, sometimes after one (o’clock) in the morning” about “rusty ships or ships in a yard, asking me what am I doing about it.”\n\nOn a visit to a shipyard that was working on the now-canceled Constellation-class frigate in 2020, Trump said he personally changed the design of the ship.\n\n“I looked at it, I said, ‘That’s a terrible-looking ship, let’s make it beautiful,’” Trump said at the time.\n\nHe said Monday he will have a direct role in designing this new warship as well.\n\n“The U.S. Navy will lead the design of these ships along with me, because I’m a very aesthetic person,” Trump said.\n\nPhelan said the new USS Defiant “will inspire awe and reverence for the American flag whenever it pulls into a foreign port.\"",

Anyone who attacks my wife, whether their name is Jen Psaki or Nick Fuentes, can eat s---,\" Vance said in an interview published by the online magazine UnHerd. “That’s my official policy as vice president of the United States.”\n\nFuentes − who the Anti-Defamation League describes as \"a white supremacist\" whose \"antisemitic commentary largely focuses on themes of Jewish power and Holocaust denial\" − used an ethnic slur to describe Usha Vance, an Indian American from a Hindu family, and referred to JD Vance as a \"race traitor\" on one of his livestreams.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Vance and Fuentes for comment.\n\nHow an interview with Nick Fuentes exposed a widening MAGA antisemitism rift\n\nPsaki − the former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden − suggested in October on the podcast \"I've Had It\" that the second lady needs to be rescued from her husband.\n\n\"I always wonder what's going on in the mind of his wife,\" said Psaki, who currently hosts a show on MSNOW. \"Like, are you OK? Please blink four times. Come over here, we'll save you.\"\n\nJD and Usha Vance married in 2014 and share three children. Before becoming the second lady, Usha Vance was a lawyer who clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he sat on the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nWho is Usha Vance? Here's what to know about the second lady of the United States\n\nOn Sunday, Dec. 21, the vice president spoke at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest conference in Phoenix, Arizona. The gathering marked the conservative group's first annual summit since its founder Charlie Kirk was shot and killed in September.\n\n“Antisemitism and all forms of ethnic hatred have no place in the conservative movement,” JD Vance told UnHerd. “Whether you’re attacking somebody because they’re white or because they’re black or because they’re Jewish, I think it’s disgusting.”\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

    "description": "Warner Bros. is in the middle of a tug-of-war between Netflix and David Ellison’s company, Paramount Skydance.",
    "fullText": "Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison is raising the stakes in the battle for Hollywood’s future, personally intervening to salvage his son David Ellison’s hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. On Monday, David’s company, Paramount Skydance, announced the elder Ellison had provided an “irrevocable personal guarantee” of $40.4 billion to finance the deal, directly countering claims that the company’s funding was unreliable.​\n\nIt’s the latest turn in the high-profile tug-of-war for Warner Bros. Discovery, one of the entertainment industry’s crown jewels. David Ellison, who became CEO of the newly merged Paramount Skydance in August, has been aggressively pursuing Warner Bros. with a $108 billion all-cash offer, which comes out to about $30 per share. However, WBD’s board rejected that proposal in favor of a rival agreement to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix for roughly $83 billion.​\n\nThe board’s rejection hinged largely on skepticism regarding the Ellison family’s financing. Last week, WBD directors dismissed Paramount’s funding as “illusory,” citing concerns that the capital was tied to a “revocable family trust” that could be altered or withdrawn before the deal closed. Larry Ellison’s Monday filing was designed to silence those doubts.\n\n“Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,” the company said in a statement, adding that the tech tycoon has agreed “not to revoke the Ellison family trust (which has been operating for nearly 40 years as a counterparty to numerous transactions) or adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction.”​\n\nThis massive personal commitment—roughly one-sixth of Larry Ellison’s $247.3 billion estimated net worth—effectively removes the WBD board’s primary defense against the takeover. To further sweeten the pot, Paramount raised its proposed breakup fee to $5.8 billion, matching the termination fee included in the rival Netflix offer.​\n\nDavid Ellison argued that his company’s bid remains the only path that preserves Warner Bros. Discovery as a whole entity, rather than selling it off in parts. Netflix’s planned acquisition would exclude WBD’s Global Networks division, which includes CNN and other cable-native brands, and which WBD had previously announced plans to spin off.\n\n“Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on Dec. 4th, and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,” David Ellison said in a statement Monday. “We expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.”​",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Lawyers for former CIA Director John Brennan want the Justice Department to be prevented from steering an investigation of him and other former government officials to a “favored” judge in Florida who dismissed the classified documents case against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe request Monday is addressed to U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga, the chief judge in the Southern District of Florida, where federal prosecutors are pursuing a criminal investigation related to the U.S. government assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Brennan and other former officials have received subpoenas, and Brennan's lawyers say he's been advised by prosecutors that he's a target of the investigation.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say in their letter that they are concerned the Justice Department is engaged in “judge-shopping” and trying to arrange for the investigation to be transferred to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who issued favorable rulings to Trump during the classified documents case and dismissed it last year. They asked Altonaga to exercise her “supervisory authority” as chief judge to ensure the Justice Department is unable to steer the current Russia-related matter to her.\n\n“In short, we are seeking assurance that any litigation arising out of this grand jury proceeding will be heard by a judge who is selected by the court’s neutral and impartial processes, not by the prosecution’s self-interested maneuvering contrary to the interests of justice,” wrote Brennan's attorneys, Kenneth Wainstein and Natasha Harnwell-Davis. The New York Times earlier reported on the letter.\n\nIt remains unclear what specific allegations of criminal conduct are being examined by prosecutors in Florida. But the subpoenas issued last month to Brennan and other former law enforcement and intelligence officials sought documents related to the preparation of the Obama administration’s intelligence community assessment, made public in January 2017, that detailed how Russia waged a covert influence campaign to help Trump defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump was investigated, but not charged, during his first term over whether his campaign conspired with Russia to tip the outcome of the election. He has long sought retribution over the Russia investigation and the officials who played a key part in it.\n\nHis Justice Department in September secured a false statement and obstruction indictment against James Comey, the FBI director at the time the Russia probe was launched, though the case against him was dismissed. Its future is in doubt thanks to a judge's ruling that blocked prosecutors, in the event they try to revive the case, from relying on communications they consider to be key evidence.\n\nBrennan's lawyers say the Trump administration Justice Department tried to “forum-shop” the investigation of him to multiple jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, before settling in Florida. But they say prosecutors have been unable to answer basic questions about why Florida is a proper venue for the investigation given that the intelligence community assessment at issue was produced by officials in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nThough it is not clear that the Justice Department will ultimately produce charges, Brennan's request reflects the fact that judges who oversee grand jury investigations can be called upon to make important decisions and resolve significant disputes, including over witness testimony, that can affect the course of the inquiry.\n\nThe grand jury investigation is currently based in the Miami division of the Southern District of Florida, but Brennan's lawyers say they're concerned that the Trump administration may be poised to try to transfer the case to the smaller Fort Pierce division, where Cannon is the only judge. They cited as a basis for that alarm a Justice Department decision to seek an additional grand jury in Fort Pierce even though, Brennan's lawyers say, there's no apparent caseload need.\n\n“The United States Attorney’s efforts to funnel this investigation to the judge who issued this string of rulings that consistently favored President Trump’s positions in previous litigations should be seen for what it is,” Brennan's lawyers wrote.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump announced that he’s nominating a MAGA ally to serve as U.S. special envoy to Greenland in a move that drew immediate anger from Denmark.\n\nThe 79-year-old president has long harbored ambitions to take over the Danish semi-autonomous territory. On Sunday, Trump announced that he would appoint Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry to serve as the envoy to the island, apparently the first time the U.S. government would have such a role.\n\n“Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,” Trump said in a statement.\n\nLandry, who only took office as governor in January 2024, and whose term ends in January 2028, described it as a “volunteer position.”\n\n“It’s an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.,” Landry wrote on X. He added, “This in no way affects my position as Governor of Louisiana!”\n\nIn reaction, the Danish foreign minister said on Monday that the United States must respect “the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.”\n\nLars Løkke Rasmussen said in a brief statement emailed by his ministry to ABC News that “the appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland.”\n\n“However, we insist that everyone—including the U.S.—must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he added.\n\nHe struck a decidedly more irritated tone in separate comments made to the Danish TV channel TV2. Calling Trump and Landry’s comments “completely unacceptable,” he said he’d be demanding an “explanation” from the U.S. ambassador.\n\n“As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland, we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty,” he said.\n\nGreenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, meanwhile, said Landry’s appointment “doesn’t change anything for us here at home.”\n\n“We will determine our future ourselves. Greenland is our country,” he wrote on social media, adding: “Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected.”\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service said in a report earlier this month that the United States is leveraging its economic clout to “assert its will” and is willing to threaten military force against both allies and adversaries.\n\nThe report highlighted the growing “strategic importance of the Arctic” amid the intensifying conflict “between Russia and the West.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly why Trump wants it. During his presidential transition and the opening months of his second term, Trump repeatedly pushed for the United States to assume jurisdiction over Greenland, and he has declined to rule out using military force to seize control of the strategically important, mineral-rich island.\n\n“For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” he wrote on Truth Social exactly a year ago.\n\nIn March, Vice President JD Vance traveled to a remote U.S. military installation in Greenland, where he accused Denmark of failing to invest adequately in the territory.\n\nWhile the dispute later faded from public view, it resurfaced in August when Danish officials summoned the U.S. ambassador after reports that at least three individuals with ties to Trump had conducted covert influence operations in Greenland. Denmark is a NATO ally of the United States.\n\nTrump made Ken Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, the U.S. ambassador to Denmark last year.",

    "title": "Jim Beam temporarily closes a Kentucky bourbon distillery amid a tough time for the American distilled spirits industry",
    "description": "Distilled spirits have seen a major decline in exports to big markets like Canada, and domestic consumption isn't making up for the shortfall.",
    "fullText": "It's been a tough time for distilled spirits.\n\nJim Beam, a brand nearly 230 years old, confirmed to Business Insider on Monday that it will halt bourbon production in its flagship distillery located in Clermont, Kentucky, for a year.\n\n\"We are always assessing production levels to best meet consumer demand and recently met with our team to discuss our volumes for 2026,\" a spokesperson of Suntory Global Spirits, parent company of Jim Beam, told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nThe spokesperson did not address whether the change is due to tariffs or counter-tariffs. The company said a separate distillery in Boston, Kentucky, will continue to operate and that the company is in communication with the union.\n\nAccording to the Jim Beam website, a few fan favorites are produced at the Clermont distillery, including the Knob Creek and the Old Overholt Rye Whiskey.\n\nThe suspension of distilling at the historic site comes at a tough time for the distilled spirits industry, due to declining demand both overseas and in the US.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2023, American whiskey sales in the US alone reached 31 million nine-liter cases, up about 132 % since 2003, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.\n\nStarting from 2024, sales began to slip. DISCUS attributed the 1.1% decline to high prices and consumer strain in a February press release, and headwinds only grew stronger in 2025.\n\nBrown-Forman, which owns Jack Daniel's, another top American whiskey brand, said in a December report that in the six months leading up to the end of October, net sales in Canada declined 62%, driven by \"volumetric declines\" in the company's American whiskey portfolio.\n\nAccording to DISCUS, the EU, Canada, the UK, and Japan accounted for 70% of spirits exports in 2024, but all of these markets have performed poorly in 2025. Overall, in Q2, exports were down 9%.\n\nAside from an off-the-cliff decline in Canada, which halted imports of US booze amid trade tensions with the Trump administration in March, the Council's mid-year report shows that spirits exports to the UK and Japan also declined by more than 23%, while exports to the EU were down 12%. The trend contributed to double-digit losses in exports across categories, including brandy, American Whiskey, vodka, and cordials.\n\nThe Council did not publish figures on how much the industry relies on exports, but said in its mid-year report that the international market \"is especially critical for American Whiskey producers, who are facing stagnating domestic sales and record-high inventory levels.\"\n\n\"There's a growing concern that our international consumers are increasingly opting for domestically produced spirits or imports from countries other than the US, signaling a shift away from our great American spirits brands,\" said Chris Swonge, CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, in an October statement.\n\nTo add to the woes of distilled spirits, a complicated set of factors is changing the way people drink within the US. Aside from ready-to-drink beverages, demand for most alcoholic products has been on a downward trend over the past few years. There is growing interest in sobriety, and the rise of other products, such as the use of recreational cannabis and weight loss drugs, could be eclipsing the desire to drink.\n\nA Gallup survey in August found that 53% of Americans believe that drinking in moderation, as in \"one or two drinks a day,\" is bad for health. The same poll also reflects a declining trend in self-reported drinking, from 62% in 2023 to 58% in 2024, before reaching 54% in 2025.",

    "description": "\"Would I have come up with that story if I didn't have those constraints? I don't know,\" James Cameron said.",
    "fullText": "Before \"The Terminator\" became a career-defining hit in 1984, James Cameron was trying to dig himself out of what he thought was a professional hole.\n\nOn Monday's episode of \"On Purpose with Jay Shetty,\" the filmmaker spoke about how getting fired from his first directing job for the film \"Piranha II: The Spawning\" felt like the end of his career.\n\nAlthough he later learned he had been \"set up\" and wasn't fired for his incompetence, Cameron said he initially viewed the experience as a personal failure.\n\n\"But I believed at the time, I internalized that I was not doing it well, you know, and I thought, 'Oh crap, now I'm worse off than if I hadn't taken the job in the first place. Now I'm at negative 10. I could have just been at zero. Now I have to dig out of a hole to get to zero,'\" Cameron, 71, told podcast host Jay Shetty.\n\nThe \"Titanic\" director said he knew he needed to do \"something extraordinary or something different\" to recover from this professional setback.\n\n\"I couldn't wait for a directing gig to come to me. I had to create it for myself. And that's when I wrote 'The Terminator,'\" he said.\n\nCameron said that he needed to create an original piece that didn't require an enormous budget or complicated sets to produce. At the same time, it couldn't be just a simple film, so Cameron decided to use his expertise in design and visual effects.\n\n\"The visual effects have to be very limited, but they have to be powerful, so that it's not a ridiculous budget like a 'Star Wars' movie that I knew we couldn't afford or nobody would hire me for,\" he said.\n\nIn the end, that's how the futuristic elements of \"The Terminator\" came about, he said.\n\n\"There was a logic to the story elements that I was playing with that was based entirely on being practical and trying to get a gig,\" he said.\n\n\"Would I have come up with that story if I didn't have those constraints? I don't know. Maybe not, you know, but it all worked out,\" he said.",

The Colts simply don't do this.\n\nMORE: The Giants, the Raiders, the NFL Draft order and the Disgrace of Gijon\n\nThe Colts are wearing a black helmet as part of a new uniform combination.\n\nThis is how ESPN described the look:\n\n\"The Indianapolis Colts will wear their 'Indiana Nights' look on Monday Night Football against the San Francisco 49ers. The design includes a black helmet for the first time in team history as well as a blue with texture in a heather style -- the first of its kind in the league. A \"C\" logo appears on the front upper corner of the uniform with a silhouette of the state of Indiana inside it.\"\n\nAs written there, the Colts have never worn a black helmet before in the regular season.\n\nThere are many reasons why teams break out new uniform combinations, some of them financial, some of them for brand building.\n\nIt's certainly a different look for Indy, but not necessarily a bad one.\n\nIf the Colts win in these helmets, they'll like them a lot more than if they lose.\n\nHarold Fannin sets Browns franchise record, celebrates with 6-7\n\nSean McDermott took his glasses off, and the Bills can't stop winning\n\nWe now know why DK Metcalf wasn't ejected for shoving a fan\n\nAn absolutely crazy ending to the Steelers-Lions game\n\nThe guy who Saquon hurdled just had his own cool hurdle\n\nTravis Kelce has joined Jerry Rice in NFL history",

The Broncos will wear the beautiful throwback uniform again against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18 (Jan. 3/4).\n\nDenver unveiled a new uniform wardrobe last year, and the NFL relaxed its rules this offseason, allowing teams to wear alternate helmets with non-alterate jerseys, which is why Denver can wear its alternate helmet with its standard road jersey.\n\nBroncos fans can also look forward to the team's upcoming \"Rivalries\" series uniform, which is set to arrive in 2027.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL news: Broncos announce uniform for Christmas game vs. Chiefs",

    "fullText": "The Mets announced Luke Weaver's signing Monday. Reports surfaced last Wednesday that New York and the right-handed reliever were finalizing a two-year contract worth $22 million.\n\n\"Over the past few seasons Luke has emerged as one of the most reliable leverage relievers in baseball and we're excited to add him to our pen,\" said Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns. \"Luke's stuff, combined with his experience in high pressure situations in New York, sets him up well for success going forward.\"\n\nWeaver, 32, spent the past two-plus seasons with the Yankees, who claimed him off waivers in September 2023.\n\nIn 148.2 IP over 126 regular-season games from 2024-25, Weaver went 11-7 with a 3.21 ERA and 0.969 WHIP.\n\n\"He got a really good deal that he earned,\" said Yankees manager Aaron Boone this past Friday. \"When we got him, it seemed like not a big move at the time, late in the '23 season -- to turn into the reliever and the role he ended up having for us.\n\n\"He threw a lot of really big games and productive games over the last couple of years -- credit to him for going out there and making a little alter to his career and it truly paying dividends for him.\"\n\nWeaver's MLB career has included stints with the St. Louis Cardinals (2016-18), Arizona Diamondbacks (2019-22), Kansas City Royals (2022), Cincinnati Reds (2023) and Seattle Mariners (2023).\n\nThe Cardinals selected Weaver from Florida State University with the No. 27 overall pick in the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft.",

    "fullText": "Lando Norris has taken on McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown in a karting challenge with DeWalt and eBay.\n\nJoined by Sky Sports F1 commentator David Croft, the pair had three challenges, including a slalom, a pitstop in which they removed a wheel on a separate kart before taking on a full hot lap.\n\n\"If Lando does win, then you probably need to go around to his flat and wash his car,\" Croft joked to Brown, who agreed there was \"a lot on the line today\".\n\nAfter Norris sailed through the challenges, with his only slight hiccup being the pitstop task, Brown hopped into the kart. Brown managed a time of 2m36s, including 15 seconds' worth of penalties for driving through cones, and Norris claimed victory with a time of 2m31s, which included a five-second penalty.\n\nNorris proudly took the trophy and joked that Brown couldn't touch it. \"They don't allow me to keep my trophies, but this one is all mine. So, McLaren aren't getting this one,\" he said with a smile.\n\nMcLaren clinched both the constructors' and drivers' championship titles in 2025 with Norris celebrating his first title. The British driver joined the McLaren Driver Development Programme in 2017 before making his Formula 1 debut with the Woking outfit in 2019. He has grown with the team over the past seven years.\n\n\"Oh, God. I've not cried in a while. I didn't think I would cry, but I did,\" Norris said after the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. \"It's a long journey. It's a long journey. First of all, I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren... My parents.\n\n\"I'm not crying... My mum, my dad. They're the ones who supported me since the beginning.\n\n\"It feels amazing. I now know what Max feels like a little bit. I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors the whole season. It's been a pleasure to race against both of them. It's been an honour. I've learned a lot from both of them as well. I've enjoyed it. It's been a long year. But we did it. We did it. I'm so proud of everyone.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "title": "Famous Idaho Potato Bowl: Utah State puts up dud against Washington State in its third consecutive bowl loss",
    "description": "Utah State hasn’t had much luck in recent bowl games, but optimism surrounds the school’s athletic department regardless",
    "fullText": "It was an ugly look for Utah State in its Famous Idaho Potato Bowl performance on Monday.\n\nThe issues were nothing new with the lack of QB protection, struggles on third downs and a missed field goal. Still, the result is the same, and the Aggies walked away with a 34-21 loss against future Pac-12 foe Washington State.\n\nMonday’s loss was the third straight bowl game loss for the Aggies.\n\n“We just ultimately didn’t play consistently enough, really in any phase, to end up having a chance to take over and win the game,” said Aggies head coach Bronco Mendenhall. “When there are moments we start to battle back, our execution didn’t hold, or our consistency didn’t hold, and that’s exactly where we were. So, I’m looking forward to the continued growth of this program, really looking forward to the Pac-12.”\n\nThe offense looked bad at times and inept in others. For the first time this season, Utah State was completely shut out in the first half.\n\nAs they had for much of the season, the problems started with the offensive line. Washington State’s defense had three sacks, six TFLs and four QB hurries in the win.\n\nUtah State had a total of just 49 yards in the first half.\n\n“(Washington State’s defense) was outstanding and there’s a reason they’ve been statistically strong not only this year at Washington State but the defensive coordinator, the previous two years, and his FCS staff were leading the country in defense,” Mendenhall said. “So, really strong scheme, really good players that execute well within that. Again, they were consistent. They were consistently better, really, in most circumstances until the very end, where we were able to make a last-minute push.”\n\nWashington State also dominated time of possession, 35:48 to Utah State’s 24:12. The Aggies also converted on only three of 13 total third downs.\n\nBryson Barnes had very little protection all day and finished his final college game with 116 passing yards, no touchdowns and one interception.\n\nBarnes ran it into the end zone for Utah State’s first touchdown in the third quarter. It was his 10th rushing touchdown of the year, which extends his school record.\n\nDespite giving up 34 points and 628 yards, the Utah State defense played decently well. It held Washington State to 14 points in the first half. It also had two sacks, nine TFLs and three interceptions.\n\nThe issue arose when the offense couldn’t stay on the field, forcing the defense back onto the field. It played well in red zone situations, but the defense was just asked to do too much.\n\nWashington State largely got it done in the air. Quarterback Zevi Eckhaus led with 334 passing yards and three touchdown passes. The Cougars finished with a total of 373 passing yards.\n\n“You have to give Washington State credit because they were executing,” Mendenhall said. “There was really no intent nor capability to run the ball in the first half. Washington State was mostly in the air, and they had success being able to run the football in the second half, which then kept our defense off balance in playing run calls, pass calls, and neither very consistently, which led to some big plays.”\n\nThe game went from bad to worse for Utah State as Ike Larsen was ejected from the game in the third quarter following a targeting call. He finished with an interception for the Aggies in his final game.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Barnes went down after taking a rough hit and exited the game.\n\nBackup quarterback Jacob Conover did give the Aggies a slight boost and something positive to look at on the stat sheet. He finished with 78 yards and two touchdown passes.\n\n“We preach just always being ready,” Conover said. “I think that just goes to show the culture that Coach Mendenhall has established. Week 13, guys are going down and it just shows the relentlessness of our team.”\n\nMonday’s bowl game felt emblematic of all the issues Utah State had. It showed that it often had the talent to play with good teams, but a few Achilles heels kept it below its potential.\n\nThe Utah State program has been full of optimism about the future over the past few weeks. Despite ending the season with two losses in its final three games, the guys were excited to get one last game.\n\nThat, combined with the excitement of a new conference and the stability of a seasoned FBS coach, created a hopeful atmosphere around the program. The poor bowl game performance definitely left a bad taste in the mouth, but it hasn’t dampened any excitement for the future of football in Logan.\n\n“I’m thrilled with the direction of Utah State football, but also Utah State athletics,” Mendenhall said. “Our athletic director is here, and I think there’s just fantastic leadership and alignment that exists there. Our new president is, man, the trifecta seems to be lined up really well. I certainly have to do my part, but I love the leadership, I love the direction, I love the support and now I love the opportunity with a new league and this program.”",

    "fullText": "DK Metcalf timeline of trouble, from Fred Warner fight and arguing with officials to punching Lions fan originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSince he entered the league in 2019, DK Metcalf has been known as one of the NFL's most productive wide receivers -- but also one of its most explosive personalities.\n\nFirst with the Seattle Seahawks, then with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Metcalf has earned a bit of a reputation for off-the-field antics, including the NFL having to discipline him. While Metcalf's dominance on the field has been a sight to behold at times, he's also been a distraction to his team at others.\n\nMetcalf has a long list of fines from the league for incidents ranging from fights and unnecessary roughness penalties, plus a 2025 suspension due to his physical interaction with a Detroit Lions fan.\n\nHere's a full timeline of Metcalf's off-the-field incidents since he entered the NFL.\n\nWhat to know about DK Metcalf getting physical with a spectator\n\nMeet Ryan Kennedy, the fan that DK Metcalf threw a punch at during Lions-Steelers game\n\nMetcalf has picked up 16 career fines from the NFL, per Spotrac, and the first came in December 2020.\n\nMetcalf, as part of a touchdown celebration, jumped into the stands — which were without fans during ongoing COVID-19 protocols — and took the broadcast camera from Fox's camera operator, moved it around a bit, then returned to the field.\n\nThe NFL then fined him $6,131 for that celebration.\n\nLmao DK Metcalf stealing the media camera and using it for his TD celebration. #Seahawkspic.twitter.com/I9mmXWevBi\n\n— Samuel Gold (@SamuelRGold) December 13, 2020\n\nIn a two-week span in October 2021, Metcalf was hit with a pair of NFL fines. First, after a matchup against the Saints, he earned a fine for unsportsmanlike conduct after a few scrums with cornerback Marshon Lattimore. Both players were fined for their roles in the incidents, seen shoving, grabbing at face masks and jawing at each other throughout the night.\n\nThen, on Halloween during the 2021 season, Metcalf was hit with a taunting fine in Week 8 after a Seahawks win over the Jaguars.\n\nMetcalf leaped up and hugged the goal post during a celebration, which he said was a reference to Antonio Brown previously doing the same, but the NFL wound up fining him $6,949 for the antics.\n\nHOW did @dkm14 make this catch 😱😱 😱\n\n📺: #JAXvsSEA on CBS pic.twitter.com/fQYMx6dVSY\n\n— x - Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) October 31, 2021\n\nMetcalf responded to his fine on social media, surprising at how much he was fined for a simple hug of the goal post.\n\nShiiii, Ain’t no hug worth that much bruh https://t.co/d16dwXb6vwpic.twitter.com/15FPHrRKy0\n\n— DeKaylin Metcalf (@dkm14) November 6, 2021\n\nThe 2021 season continued to be a busy one for Metcalf in Week 10, when his emotions boiled over during a 17-0 loss to the Packers. With less than two minutes remaining in the game, the receiver got into a fight with Packers safety Henry Black after grabbing Black's facemask during a scuffle.\n\nMetcalf was ejected for fighting, then also received a $6,949 fine.\n\n#Seahawks WR DK Metcalf has been ejected after this altercation with #Packers DB Henry Black.pic.twitter.com/Ry1jdhIOpd\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) November 15, 2021\n\nPlenty of NFL players debate with officials, pleading their case for the right call, but Metcalf seemed to have taken it too far in November 2022. In Week 10, he was flagged during the Seahawks' matchup against the Buccaneers after arguing an uncalled defensive pass interference penalty in the end zone.\n\nThe NFL proceeded to hit him with a $29,785 fine for arguing with an official, and while Metcalf appealed the fine, it was upheld. Per Adam Schefter, Metcalf was said to asked the official in the game if a play was pass interference, and the official was said to respond, “Did I throw a flag?”\n\nToward the end of the 2022 regular season, Metcalf received two fines from the NFL. The first came following Week 13 against the Rams, as Metcalf heat-butted opposing cornerback Jalen Ramsey and was called for unsportsmanlike conduct, then fined $10,609.\n\n“Yeah, I head-butted him on purpose,” Metcalf said, per the Seattle Times. “The official’s right there. [Ramsey] pushed me, so I head-butted him. It’s football.”\n\nThen, when the Seahawks and Rams met a few weeks later in January, Metcalf was fined another $21,219 for unsportsmanlike conduct in an exchange with Ramsey.\n\nMetcalf's troublemaking against the Rams continued into the 2023 season. In Week 1, Seattle took on L.A., and Metcalf had an ugly series where he blindsided safety Ahkello Witherspoon with a late hit to the ground, which wasn't part of the play.\n\nThat was then followed by a taunting penalty, meaning Metcalf received a pair of fines for a total of $21,854 from the NFL.\n\nFrustrations boiling over for the Seahawks right now 😬\npic.twitter.com/GvF7Kbkdqn\n\n— PFF (@PFF) September 10, 2023\n\nSeahawks head coach Pete Carroll later said Metcalf had to start to \"elevate above\" the antics, as his fines and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties were becoming a theme.\n\n\"DK and I talked for a long time last night about [how] that's not what we can allow to happen because that means that they can control him and get after him,\" Carroll said on his Seattle Sports 710-AM radio show, per ESPN. \"So, he has to elevate above that. So it's a challenge. This is nothing new. DK's been an emotional, feisty, fiery player since the day he got here, and that is who he is. But he has to also manage that so they don't take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe penalties continued for Metcalf in Weeks 2 and 3 of the 2023 season, as he was first flagged for a facemask on safety Kerby Joseph against the Lions, resulting in a fine of $10,927.\n\nThen, in Week 3, Metcalf was fined $16,391 by the NFL for an unnecessary roughness penalty against the Panthers, which resulted from him laying an illegal blindside block on a Carolina defender.\n\nWeek 6 of the 2023 season saw Metcalf get into a spat with Cincinnati Bengals DB Cam Taylor-Britt. The receiver shoved Taylor-Britt to the ground from behind after the whistle, and it resulted in a $16,391 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nWhat a stupid play by DK Metcalf. Glad the ref was right there to see this https://t.co/50Hc0QX4kt\n\n— Kelsey Conway (@KelseyLConway) October 15, 2023\n\nMetcalf found another opposing defender to confront in Week 14 of the 2023 season, getting into it with San Francisco 49ers linebacker Fred Warner. Metcalf slammed Warner to the ground, then as the two began to fight, he grabbed Warner's facemask.\n\nMetcalf was ejected from the game, then fined $19,123 for fighting.\n\nSeahawks WR DK Metcalf has been ejected for this interaction with 49ers LB Fred Warner. pic.twitter.com/NX1SJXvp5n\n\n— Arye Pulli (@AryePulliNFL) December 10, 2023\n\nWhile no penalty was thrown in the game, Metcalf walked away from the Seahawks' matchup against the Giants in October 2024 with more fines to pay.\n\nHe was dinged $11,255 for an uncalled roughness penalty in the game, after he appeared to throw Giants cornerback Deonte Banks to the ground.\n\nDK Metcalf was fined for unnecessary roughness on the big Tyler Lockett catch before halftime against the Giants.\n\nCheck the bottom left of the video at the end of the play. pic.twitter.com/monKTwPCLj\n\n— Mookie Alexander (@mookiealexander) October 12, 2024\n\nFollowing a Seahawks vs. Bears matchup in January 2025, one of Metcalf's final games for Seattle, he was docked $22,511 for a skirmish with Chicago cornerback Tyrique Stevenson.\n\nMetcalf and Stevenson got into it, pushing and shoving a bit, then Metcalf head-butted Stevenson with his helmet, resulting in the fine.\n\nThe NFL fined #Seahawks WR DK Metcalf $22,511 for unnecessary roughness (use of helmet) for head-butting #Bears CB Tyrique Stevenson during their dust-up last week. pic.twitter.com/lZljQR9hXS\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) January 4, 2025\n\nMetcalf received his first fine as a member of the Steelers in November 2025, hit with a $12,171 charge for unsportsmanlike conduct after an unnecessary roughness flag in the fourth quarter of Pittsburgh’s 35-25 defeat to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nMetcalf engaged in a brief altercation with linebacker Quay Walker, putting his fingers in Walker’s facemask and grabbing it.\n\nThe NFL fined Steelers WR DK Metcalf $12,172 for unsportsmanlike conduct — this run-in with Packers LB Quay Walker last week.\n\npic.twitter.com/b1lwIptFfr\n\n— Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) November 1, 2025\n\nIn Week 13, after the Steelers took on the Bills, Metcalf was fined $14,491 for unsportsmanlike conduct/obscene gesture.\n\nAfter years and years of fines, Metcalf's actions resulted in a suspension for the first tie in Week 16 of the 2025 season. During the Steelers' matchup against the Detroit Lions, Metcalf was seen swiping at a Lions fan in the stands as he stood on Pittsburgh's sideline at Ford Field.\n\nOfficials did not see the interaction, so he was not penalized in the game, but CBS' broadcast caught Metcalf hitting the Lions fan. The next day, the NFL announced a two-game suspension without pay for Metcalf.\n\nAnother angle of the DK Metcalf incident with a Lions fan has been released....\n\n(via keiffer_kennedy/IG, h/t @premefootball)pic.twitter.com/CwXWQZqAuIhttps://t.co/Ej5KLXFtUz\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 22, 2025\n\nDK Metcalf appears to have an altercation with a Detroit fan pic.twitter.com/a478Zjg3tR\n\n— NFL on CBS 🏈 (@NFLonCBS) December 21, 2025\n\nPer ESPN, the Detroit Free Press spoke to the fan who was involved in the altercation, and he identified himself as Ryan Kennedy from Pinckney, Michigan. Kennedy said he called Metcalf by his full name, DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf, which prompted the receiver's physical reaction.\n\n\"I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,\" Kennedy told the Free Press, per ESPN. \"I'm a little shocked. Like everyone's talking to me. I'm a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.\"\n\nNFL Network's Tom Pelissero also reported that Kennedy and Metcalf had a history, as Metcalf reportedly had issues with Kennedy in 2024 when he was with the Seattle Seahawks and had previously reported the fan to security.\n\nAfter rumors over whether or not Kennedy used hateful language in the incident, the Lions fan released a statement denying that he used any racial or derogatory language to Metcalf in the interaction through his lawyer.\n\n\"Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the \"N-word,\" the \"C-word,\" or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on December 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game. These allegations are completely false.\"\n\nRyan Kennedy, the fan involved in the DK Metcalf altercation Sunday, has issued a statement through an attorney “categorically denying using the “N-word,” the “C-word,” or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident.\n\n“These allegations are completely false.” pic.twitter.com/pQUbBYa0ww\n\n— Brooke Pryor (@bepryor) December 22, 2025\n\nMORE: Ranking the best players in Steelers history",

    "description": "The John R.",

Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nWhen Rick Barnes was handed the 2018 Coach Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award, it was noted how his life displayed the character traits of integrity and leadership in the game of basketball, reflecting the values of legendary coach John Wooden.\n\nIt's long been the University of Tennessee coach's mantra, consistently blending culture, development, and adaptability for the young men he's mentored since beginning his coaching career in 1977.\n\nBarnes, who ranks among the all-time Top 20 winningest men's college basketball coaches, hasn't just been a coach who wins games; he's built sustainable programs.\n\nBarnes turned Clemson into a national contender in the 1990s, he elevated Texas into a national power with regular NBA talent, and more recently, he's rebuilt Tennessee into one of the SEC’s most consistent teams.\n\nBarnes went to the Final Four with Texas in 2003, won the Big East Tournament with Providence in 1994 and the SEC Tournament in 2022 with Tennessee.\n\nHe's also won a combined five regular-season conference championships with Texas and Tennessee.\n\nThere have been very few coaches who have succeeded at three different top-tier major schools.\n\nThough he's known for being a demanding coach, he's never fallen short of the respect he's received from players.\n\nBarnes has always been clear about his standards for effort and behavior. His players have learned there are no shortcuts toward minutes earned, and he's always allowed for strong locker-room leadership\n\nMany of his former players often talk about how much Barnes helped them mature as men, not just as athletes, a culture that leads to consistency year after year.\n\nAs for his coaching style, Barnes' teams are almost always physically tough behind a disciplined defense. They've typically been stellar with their half-court defense.\n\nHis teams have long been known for elite defensive efficiency, ball pressure, and rebounding. Defense has consistently given him a reliable floor every season, even when the offense fluctuates.\n\nEmphatic about established player development, Barnes always excels at developing players who elect to stay multiple years under his tutelage. Guards have been known to improve their decision-making and tenacity, his bigs get fundamentally stronger defensively and role players have notoriously grown into stars.\n\nMany of his best teams weren’t loaded with one-and-done talent, but with grown, experienced players who understood their roles.\n\nHis roster-building skills generally start with his knack for recruiting players who fit the system before they even arrive in the locker room.\n\nRather than chasing only top-5 recruits, Barnes prioritizes toughness, coachability and a defensive-mindset.\n\nCurrently, at Tennessee, Barnes has found players who fit the SEC grind and who buy into a team-basketball philosophy.\n\nUltimately, that translates into a mirror image of Barnes, who promotes consistency over flash.\n\nDespite being criticized for not having a national title, Barnes' real strength has producing his fair share of winning seasons, regular NCAA tournament appearances, getting his players to commit to higher standards and promoting the type of reliability that is extremely valuable in college basketball.\n\nThis former Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award winner will go down as someone known as a teacher, culture-builder and defensive tactician who adapted over six decades without worrying about flash, but more so toughness and competitive consistency year after year.",

    "fullText": "What the Astros should do with 3B Isaac Paredes has not only been polarizing to the fans but a true point of contention with the franchise. Paredes is coming off the second best statistical season of his career, but it is also one year removed from one of his worst.\n\nIn his four mostly-full seasons, Paredes has alternated between OPS seasons of .739/.740, and OPS seasons of 800+. For his career, he is a .237 hitter with a .337 career OBP and .766 career OPS.\n\nLast season, Paredes performed above his career norms, batting .254 with a .352 OBP and .809 OPS. It should also be noted that prior to suffering a torn hamstring, Paredes was batting .259 with a .359 OBP and .829 OPS, and that his final numbers went down a bit while he heroically tried to play on one leg down the stretch.\n\nParedes reestablished himself as a power bat at a premium position, and has two years of team control (Paredes qualified as a Super 2 player, so he has 4 arbitration years, and is entering Arb 3).\n\nWhen Paredes went down July 19, he was the Astros best hitter to date, with a combination of power and plate discipline (noted by an OBP approximately 100 points higher than his batting average) that the Astros have wanted to get back to as a team over the last few years but have struggled to do so.\n\nAs a result, Paredes’ trade value around MLB is very strong. With an arbitration number this year of approximately $10M, Paredes represents a terrific value at a position where performances like Paredes’ last season are uncommon.\n\nWith Chandler Rome’s report yesterday that Paredes was making his Winter League debut, that would indicate that Paredes is ahead of schedule in his return from his hamstring injury. Previously, it had been reported that Paredes was not expected to be 100% entering Spring Training and may not be fully healed when the season started. With Paredes now playing winter ball, it lends credence to the idea that Paredes may be closer to full health than previously thought and be at or close to 100% entering Spring Training.\n\nThis not only means that Paredes could be healthy enough to play 1B and 2B in February, but also increases his trade value as any fears over lingering injury issues that interested teams may have had.\n\nParedes injury last season also forced the Astros, then in first place, to make trades to acquire more infielders. They traded for Ramon Urias, with the idea he could play both 2B and 3B, and then later took advantage of the Twins fire sale and re-acquired SS Carlos Correa who agreed to move to 3B.\n\nCorrea is a former Gold Glove SS who looked every bit the part of a Gold Glove 3B once in Houston. Paredes, to be fair, is not a comparable defender to Correa. Last season, Paredes was worth -3 Outs Above Average (OAA) – he’s a below average defender (not to be confused with a ‘bad defender’, which he is not)\n\nChristian Walker is a former 3-time Gold Glover from 2022-2024 with Arizona. Despite a subpar overall season, Walker did post numbers \n\nLast season, Walker hit .229 with a .286 OBP and .660 OPS, with 12 HR and 47 RBI over 377 PA (including 23 BB) in the first half. In the second half, Walker hit .250 with a .312 OBP and .799 OPS with 15 HR and 41 RBI over 263 PA (including 17 BB).\n\nHow much his first half was impacted by a rushed recovery from an oblique injury suffered during Spring Training (the same injury that kept him out over 2 months the season before in Arizona) can’t be measured but should be taken into consideration. It should also be taken into consideration that his second half would project to a full season (650 PA) of 37 HR and 101 RBI, exactly the kind of power production the Astros wanted to have hitting behind Yordan Alvarez in the lineup last season, and now Yordan and Correa in the lineup this season.\n\nWalker’s glove also gave Correa, Paredes and Jeremy Pena a lot of confidence that they can let throws rip and Walker would come up with them, which he did. Whether or not Paredes can do the same is an unknown.\n\nHence the Astros find themselves in a conundrum. They love Paredes’ approach at the plate, they don’t know what kind of defense he will provide at a position other than 3B, and he clearly has the most value of any batter on their team not named Yordan Alvarez.\n\nThere is a school of thought to trading players when they have reached a zenith in value, and it’s fair to presume that Paredes has hit that zenith this offseason. Considering the Astros stated needs of starting pitching, their bargain bin signings and recent trade for Mike Burrows that cost MiLB CF Jacob Melton (their #2 prospect) and MiLB SP Anderson Brito (their #4 prospect), it stands to reason the best path to the Astros getting the kind of arm that could help replace Framber Valdez (who is not re-signing in Houston) would be in a trade involving Paredes. There is no chance a deal centered around Christian Walker could generate such a return, even with adding another top prospect like Brice Matthews. (Note the Pirates got 3 major league players for Burrows, as the price for controllable SPs is currently astronomical in terms of prospects).\n\nClearly, the team has a issue of having too many players on the infield and not enough places to play them. The Jose Altuve in LF experiment was an abject failure, and he needs to either play 2B or DH. There won’t be a lot of DH reps for anyone with a healthy Yordan Alvarez if Dana Brown’s most recent comments on Yordan getting less time in LF prove true, which locks Altuve at 2B.\n\nTherefore, it stands to reason that Paredes or Walker will be the primary 1B, and that one of them will not be here when the calendar turns to February. Trading Paredes would generate a strong return. Trading Walker would require the Astros pay down part of his contract. For a team that is conscious of it’s current position relative to the first tax line, eating salary for a lesser return seems like a far worse decision than not eating money for a strong return of positions in need.\n\nIn no manner am I advocating that Walker is a better hitter than Paredes or is a better fit in the lineup, but I am advocating that the Astros can get a lot more for Paredes than Walker in terms of value. To get a #2 type young starter with team control (or a young SP with #2 upside) would absolutely require trading Paredes to reallocate his money/roster spot to that particular pitcher. Ideally the pitcher would earn less than Paredes and the team would have a net gain in salary, potentially allowing them to make another needed move.\n\nParedes is the kind of younger player a team like Houston should be building around if they were, in fact, rebuilding. However, this team is not rebuilding, they are re-tooling. They still have a roster capable of winning the AL West, they will still have the highest payroll in the AL West, and if they can avoid the “IL of DOOM” type season they had a year ago, they should win the AL West.\n\nJim Crane maintains as long as he is around, the window is always open. If that is going to be the case without punching up a $275M+ payroll, then it is going to require trading Isaac Paredes now and at his highest value to get the pitching they need to get through 162 games and be in the postseason.",

    "fullText": "Monday’s 34-21 loss to Washington State in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl marked the end of Bronco Mendenhall’s first year in Logan. It was also the end of the collegiate road for many of Utah State’s top contributors, including quarterback Bryson Barnes.\n\nWith the season over and the Mountain West era in the past, what’s next for Utah State football?\n\nThe new Pac-12 will officially begin on July 1. The Aggies will see some familiar faces from the Mountain West, but they will also see new faces in Washington State, Oregon State and Texas State.\n\nThe move will mean a jump in competitiveness in conference play, but one that Bronco Mendenhall welcomes wholeheartedly.\n\n“I’m thrilled with the direction of Utah State football, but also Utah State athletics,” Mendenhall said. “... I think there’s just fantastic leadership and alignment that exists there. Our new president is, man, the trifecta seems to be lined up really well. I certainly have to do my part, but I love the leadership, I love the direction, I love the support and now I love the opportunity with a new league and this program.”\n\nArguably, the most significant question the coaching staff needs to answer this offseason regards the quarterback position.\n\nBarnes has had a great season with the Aggies and helped push what’s been an otherwise middling offense.\n\nEven the second-stringer, Jacob Conover, has no years of eligibility left. Conover jumped into Monday’s bowl game after Barnes went down in the fourth quarter. He threw two touchdown passes in his limited time.\n\nBeyond just the quarterback, Mendenhall has a big task of replacing offensive talent such as Braden Pegan. Pegan was the Aggies’ top receiver this year and announced his intent to enter the transfer portal earlier this month.\n\nUtah State is also losing wide receiver Brady Boyd and its top running back, Miles Davis.\n\nMendenhall also has to focus on bolstering the offensive line, which was a significant issue for Utah State all year.\n\nEven defensively, the Aggies are losing significant contributors in John Miller, Ike Larsen and Noah Avinger.",

Currently, the 49ers are a half-game behind the Rams and a game-and-a-half behind the Seahawks in the NFC West.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts currently sit in the No. 8 spot in the AFC Playoff picture and third in their division. For Indianapolis, this is a near must-win game for them, as they’re currently a game-and-a-half behind the Texans, who currently hold the No. 7 spot in the AFC Playoffs and are also in second place in the AFC South. If the Colts win this game, they’ll have a 6% chance of making the playoffs, while a loss drops them down to 1%, per the Athletic’s (New York Times’) playoff simulator.\n\nFrom a rooting perspective, because the Lions cannot catch the 49ers in the NFC Playoff seeding, there’s nothing really to root for in this game.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nHere’s how to watch tonight’s game:\n\nWhen: Monday, December 22, 2025 — 8:15 p.m. ET\nWhere: Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana\nTV: ESPN\nAnnouncers: Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, with field reporters Lisa Salters and Laura Rutledge\nOnline streaming: ESPN+, Hulu + Live TV, NFL+\n\nNo Manningcast this week: The Manningcast returns in Week 18\n\nLet’s watch some football together.

San Francisco heads into this matchup as the No. 6 seed, but still has a mathematical chance at the No. 1 seed for the NFC.

    "fullText": "Matthew Stafford lost some ground on the MVP lead after Week 16 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nComing into the week, the Los Angeles Rams' quarterback was appearing to walk away with the MVP award with flying colors based on how well he and the team had been playing throughout the season.\n\nHis chances were bolstered even more thanks to the Week 15 loss by another favored MVP candidate, Drake Maye, and the New England Patriots.\n\nHowever, with a critical loss in an overtime thriller to the Seattle Seahawks and the danger of losing the NFC West on 'Thursday Night Football' and Maye having the best performance of his young career against the Baltimore Ravens to clinch a playoff berth, throwing for a career high, 380 passing yards, and leading a fourth quarter comeback, it has arguably become anyone's reward.\n\nStafford and the Rams are currently the fifth seed in the NFC playoff picture at 11-4 and will be heavily favored to win their final two games of the season against the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals, but don't control their own destiny to win the division and capture the top seed for the playoffs.\n\nWhereas Maye and the Patriots have the luxury of winning the AFC East by taking care of business against division rivals, the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, who will both miss the postseason, and still have a solid chance at the top seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nThe fact of the NFC West being one of the most competitive divisions in the league, along with the conference as a whole, could bode well for the 17-year veteran, whether Los Angeles has a first-round bye or has to play a road wild-card game.\n\nAlso, Stafford still has the better stats than Maye and every other quarterback, throwing for 4,179 yards and 40 touchdowns, ranking first in both categories, and with only five interceptions, which is best in the top five in the league.\n\nAlthough it may not be as obvious heading into the final two weeks of the season, regardless of what happens, Stafford has made it difficult for anyone to take the MVP award from him.\n\nMatthew Stafford has the chance to accomplish something not seen since 2020. Is it enough for MVP?\n\nRams make coaching change right before the playoffs. Is this a wise decision?\n\nAfter Sean McVay update, how long will the Rams be without Davante Adams?\n\nRams' Matthew Stafford climbs prestigious NFL record list with epic Thursday night stats\n\nCan Matthew Stafford win MVP without a division title for Rams?",

    "title": "The Death and Rebirth of Programming",
    "description": "Programming didn't die all at once. There was no single moment, no dramatic obsolescence event. Instead, something quieter happened: the core constraint that shaped software for seventy years dissolved. Writing code stopped being the hard part.",
    "fullText": "For most of computing history, programming was bottlenecked by human cognition. Translating intent into working software required time, attention, and specialized skill. Even small changes were costly. This scarcity justified entire ecosystems: languages, frameworks, methodologies, reviews, team rituals that made sense when every line was expensive.\n\nGenerative AI removes that scarcity.\n\nToday, a single developer can generate thousands of lines of working code in minutes. Tomorrow, that number will be effectively infinite. The marginal cost of producing code is collapsing toward zero.\n\nWhat hasn't collapsed is the cost of knowing what the code does.\n\nUnderstanding, verifying, securing, and evolving software remain stubbornly expensive. In fact, they may be getting harder as volume explodes. This asymmetry—the ease of creation versus the difficulty of comprehension—is the defining tension of modern software.\n\nProgramming hasn't disappeared. But its center of gravity has shifted.\n\nIn the old world, programmers owned code. You wrote it, you understood it, you maintained it. Your value was tied to mastery of specific implementations. Codebases accrued history, reputation, and power.\n\nIn the new world, ownership becomes a liability.\n\nWhen code can be regenerated faster than it can be understood, preserving it for sentimental or historical reasons no longer makes sense. What matters instead is stewardship: maintaining the system's behavior, boundaries, and intent over time, regardless of how many times its internals are replaced.\n\nThis reframing is subtle but profound:\n\nThe asset is no longer the codebase. The asset is the system's ability to keep working.\n\nThis is the thesis of everything that follows. Architecture, testing, interfaces, team structure: all of it flows from this inversion.\n\nMany of the \"modern\" software practices of the last decade were early adaptations to this shift, even if we didn't articulate them that way.\n\nImmutable infrastructure. Stateless services. Containers. Blue-green deployments. Infrastructure as code.\n\nThese ideas all share a common premise: never fix a running thing. Replace it.\n\nAI pushes this premise beyond infrastructure and into application code itself. When rewriting is cheap, editing in place becomes risky. Mutation accumulates entropy. Replacement resets it.\n\nDisposability stops being a hack. It becomes the default.\n\nThis transition isn't just technical. It's deeply psychological, and that psychology shapes architecture.\n\nMany developers identify as builders and craftspeople. We take pride in elegance, cleverness, and mastery of internals. We accumulate knowledge inside our heads and inside codebases. Longevity feels like validation.\n\nGenerative AI destabilizes this identity.\n\nWhen a machine can produce a competent version of \"your\" solution in seconds, craftsmanship no longer lies in the artifact. It lies in framing the problem, defining success, and deciding what to keep and what to discard.\n\nThe role shifts from maker to architect. From author to managing editor. From preserving code to designing for its replacement.\n\nThat shift is uncomfortable. And the discomfort isn't merely personal. It's what makes teams resist the very patterns that would help them. Developers cling to codebases because identity is at stake, not just technical judgment. Acknowledging this is the first step toward building systems that don't require heroics to change.\n\nResisting the shift doesn't stop it. It just makes systems more fragile.\n\nOne of the clearest signals of this new era is the rise of the n=1 developer.\n\nProjects that once required teams now fit inside a single person's cognitive boundary—with AI filling in the execution gaps. Entire products can be specified, generated, evaluated, and shipped by one human working with machines.\n\nThis isn't about productivity hacks. It's about a structural change in leverage.\n\nBut n=1 development only works if systems are designed for it. Large, tangled, historically accreted codebases collapse under their own weight when AI accelerates change. Small, modular, disposable systems thrive.\n\nThe n=1 developer is not a superhero. They are an indicator species. They are evidence that the environment has changed, and proof that the new patterns actually work.\n\nIt's tempting to frame this as the \"end of programming.\" That's misleading.\n\nWhat's dying is a specific form of programming: one that equates value with authored code, longevity of code with quality, and maintenance with virtue.\n\nWhat's being born is something closer to systems design as an ongoing process of regeneration:\n\nCode becomes an intermediate artifact, not the final product. Rewrites become routine, not traumatic. Tests and evaluations define truth, not files. Stability emerges from replacement, not preservation.\n\nThis is not nihilism. It's pragmatism under new constraints.\n\nThe rest of this publication builds on a single premise established here:\n\nWhen code is cheap and understanding is expensive, architecture must optimize for the impermanence of code.\n\nEverything else (pace layers, evaluations, clean interfaces, regeneration workflows) flows from that fact.\n\nWe are not entering a world with less software. We are entering a world with vastly more of it. The only way to survive that abundance is to stop treating code as precious.\n\nBut it has been reborn, and it expects us to change with it.",

    "fullText": "Software is entering a strange new phase.\n\nFor most of its history, code was expensive to produce and cheap to keep. We treated it like a durable asset: written carefully, maintained lovingly, upgraded cautiously. Whole professions, identities, and institutions grew around this assumption. Programmers were craftsmen. Codebases were cities. Refactoring was urban renewal.\n\nGenerative AI breaks this assumption at the root.\n\nCode is no longer scarce. It is abundant, fast, and increasingly disposable. The limiting factor is no longer writing software, but understanding, evaluating, and governing it. The economics have inverted. The psychology hasn’t caught up.\n\nThis publication exists to explore what comes next.\n\nThe central paradox I want to explore is simple:\n\nWhen code is cheap to generate, preserving it at all costs becomes irrational. Yet we still need systems that are reliable, secure, comprehensible, and long-lived. The solution is not to fight ephemerality but to design around it.\n\nThis means shifting what we treat as permanent.\n\nNot implementations, but interfaces\n\nIn other words: the system is the asset. Code is just a consumable input.\n\nMost software practices today are optimization strategies for a world where code is expensive to write and dangerous to replace. We edit files in place. We fear rewrites. We celebrate longevity of codebases as a proxy for quality.\n\nAI changes the cost curve so dramatically that these habits start to look like technical debt generators.\n\nInstead of maintaining code, we can regenerate it.\nInstead of upgrading in place, we can replace.\nInstead of debugging line by line, we can select between competing implementations.\nInstead of trusting authorship, we can trust evaluation.\n\nThis is not a call for recklessness. It’s a call for discipline—a different kind than we’re used to.\n\nThe metaphor I keep returning to is the phoenix: systems designed to burn and be reborn, continuously, without losing their identity.\n\nA regenerative system has a few defining traits:\n\nClear, durable boundaries that outlive any implementation\n\nTests and evaluations that define correctness independently of code\n\nAutomation that assumes replacement is normal, not exceptional\n\nExplicit acceptance that code will rot, drift, or become incomprehensible\n\nCultural comfort with deletion, rewriting, and starting over\n\nIn such systems, failure is localized, recovery is fast, and improvement emerges through iteration rather than preservation.\n\nThe goal is not immortality of code.\nThe goal is immortality of intent.\n\nRight now, many teams are using generative AI as a productivity multiplier inside old mental models. Faster coding. Bigger diffs. More surface area. Same assumptions.\n\nBut it also accelerates entropy. Larger codebases. Lower comprehension. More fragile systems. Higher cognitive load per developer. The very speed that AI enables becomes a liability.\n\nWe need architectures, workflows, and cultures that treat AI not as a faster typist, but as a fundamentally different substrate for building systems.\n\nWhat “quality” means when code can be rewritten tomorrow\n\nHow we test systems whose implementations are transient\n\nHow we organize teams when one person can ship what used to require many\n\nHow we manage cost when context windows and tokens replace headcount\n\nHow we remain accountable when authorship dissolves\n\nThese are not tooling questions. They are architectural and philosophical ones.\n\nThis will be a slow, cumulative exploration—one post at a time.\n\nTopics I plan to cover include:\n\nPace layers and why different parts of systems should regenerate at different rates\n\nThe idea of n=1 development and what it means for teams and organizations\n\nEvaluations as the true source code\n\nWhy rewriting beats refactoring in the AI era\n\nHow to design interfaces that survive constant replacement\n\nThe economics of code as cost, not capital\n\nCultural shifts required to celebrate deletion instead of preservation\n\nPatterns for building systems that expect to be rewritten\n\nSome posts will be conceptual. Some will be practical. Some will be uncomfortable.\n\nThis is not about hype, nor about dismissing decades of hard-won engineering wisdom. Many of the ideas here build directly on them—immutable infrastructure, test-first design, separation of concerns, automation, evolutionary architectures.\n\nWhat’s changing is the environment.\n\nWhen the substrate shifts, the architecture must follow.\n\nIf you’re building software with AI—or expect to be—you’re already living inside this transition, whether you’ve named it or not. My goal here is to help articulate a vocabulary, a set of patterns, and a philosophy that make the transition legible.\n\nSoftware that lasts will not be frozen in amber.\nIt will be continuously reborn.\n\nWelcome to Regenerative Software.",

    "description": "Part 2 of the series covers some nuances in using the caching architecture pattern and offers some tips in scaling the cache infrastructure for larger loads.",
    "fullText": "In part 1 of this series, we looked at the different types of caches and the various ways they can be used to scale up applications. Now let’s look at some nuances of using caching.\n\nLike any other part of the system design, caches come under load as the scale of the application increases. External caches are servers like any other and can buckle under the read/write traffic being sent their way. Even in-memory caches can suffer degraded performance due to read locking if too many application threads try to access them, although this is much harder to get to and easier to mitigate. let’s look at some problems and solutions scaling caches.\n\nA cache is essentially a data store, and the problem of scaling for traffic is a well-known one in the database domain. Rising traffic can cause scalability problems by increasing the CPU usage or by choking the network bandwidth available to a server.\n\nThe most straightforward way to scale for an increase in traffic is to have multiple servers which can serve the traffic. In databases, we typically configure a master-slave (aka leader-follower) topology where all writes go to a single server which replicates them across all the other servers. This way, all servers have all the data and the application can connect to any of them to read them. This reduces the load on each server by a factor of the number of servers.\n\nSince writes to cache data are much rarer than reads, the overhead of replicating the writes to all slave servers is usually acceptable.\n\nBoth Twemproxy and Redis Sentinel are examples of implementation which use redundancies to scale caches.\n\nWe have already discussed this under external distributed caches. If we want to store more data, we really don’t have a choice but to distribute it across more than one server. This directly brings the cache into the world of distributed systems with all its attendant pros and cons.\n\nNote that distributing data across multiple servers solves for both data and traffic scaling since no single server faces as much traffic as in the case of a single cache instance. However, we can look at only doing redundant deployments if our problem is just traffic and not data volume. Data replication is a simpler problem than data distribution.\n\nBoth Twemproxy and Redis Cluster are examples of distributing data to scale to larger data volumes.\n\nIn high throughput systems, a scenario emerges in the use of caches which, if not handled properly, can bring down the entire system. This has happened to pretty much every large scale company like Facebook, Doordash, Instagram etc. I have personally encountered it while building the Promise Engine at Myntra.\n\nLet’s say that we are using a read-through cache where application processes first try to read data from a cache, and if not found (cache miss) they tried to load it from the source database/system. If this is a high throughput system involving a large number of concurrent accesses to the cache, then even if a single key is missing, a large number of processes will try to access the database to read this data at the same time. This now triggers a flood of traffic to the database, which may now collapse under it since it always expects a cache to sit in front of it and is not designed to take such a heavy spike of traffic.\n\nThis means that a single heavily accessed key being missing from the cache can trigger a complete system collapse. Such is the fine line of high scalability!\n\nBefore we try to solve the problem, please evaluate if this is a problem for your system. If your cache were to vanish and the traffic were to hit your database at once, would the database hold up with perhaps only a temporary spike in latency? If so, you do not need to worry about a cache stampede. It is worthwhile doing a simulation in your production environment to verify this.\n\nIf you think this is going to be a problem for you. there are a few approaches you can take.\n\nThis approach treats the cache as the source of truth. The idea is that since a cache stampede is triggered by a cache miss, if you can load all the data into the cache using a refresh ahead strategy, then a cache miss will never happen and hence cache stampede will be avoided.\n\nWhile this is possible for small datasets, keeping large data set fully loaded at all times is not always feasible for cost reasons.\n\nLet’s say a cache miss occurs when 1000 processes are trying to access a key concurrently. To prevent all of them from rushing to the database, we can implement a mutex lock/leader election mechanism to elect one process which goes to the database to get the data and refresh the cache. The other processes can either wait for the cache to be filled before trying again (leading to temporarily increased latency) or they can all throw an error to their respective callers (leading to a brief spike of errors).\n\nObtaining locks in a distributed environment is a complicated but solved problem. Zookeeper and Redis both offer convenient ways of doing this, but you can roll your own using lock entries in a table if you think it is easier (it isn’t).\n\nThis is a smarter solution than most teams require, but the idea is to balance the above two approaches. If we cannot load all the data in the cache but still want to prevent cache misses, then the only way is to reload the keys intelligently before it expires from the cache. This paper outlines one of the strategies for preemptive loading of keys before they expire.\n\nCache stampede is one instance of the new failure modes introduced into an architecture that uses caching. In designing high scale applications, this outcome of cache miss should be carefully considered before using caches.\n\nRead Next: More articles on architecture patterns.\n\nIf you liked this, subscribe to my weekly newsletter It Depends to read about software engineering and technical leadership",

    "description": "Americans won’t be able to buy new models from DJI, the Chinese maker of most of the world’s drones. But U.S. pilots can keep the drones they have.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Monday that all foreign-made drones and their components posed “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States” and would be put on a federal blacklist of equipment makers prohibited from selling their goods freely in the country.\n\nA fact sheet released by the Federal Communications Commission left some room for exceptions. The Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security can clear a drone or component for use. But it heralded a new reality that American drone pilots have been dreading for months: New models produced by DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that makes most of the world’s drones, will no longer be sold in the United States. The statement did not mention DJI by name.\n\n“The F.C.C. will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance,” Brendan Carr, the commission’s chairman, said in a statement.\n\nMany of the nearly half a million registered drone pilots in the United States have built small businesses with DJI equipment. The drones perform a variety of jobs, such as spraying farmers’ fields with fertilizer, surveying land, monitoring construction projects and inspecting roofs and utility lines.\n\n“People are pissed — incredibly, incredibly pissed — about the whole thing,” said Vic Moss, the volunteer director of the Drone Advocacy Alliance, which represents pilots who want to continue to buy DJI drones.\n\nOne reason the administration did not try to ban the use of drones that Americans already possess, he said, was that doing so would impede emergency workers. Law enforcement agencies across the country use fleets of DJI drones to track down fleeing suspects, lost hikers and the bodies of children who have washed away in floods.\n\nThe seeds of the decision were planted in Congress a year ago, when the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a determination by Dec. 23, 2025, about whether video surveillance equipment produced by DJI or Autel Robotics, another Chinese manufacturer, posed a security threat. The language came from a bill written by Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who vowed to “ensure Chinese drones are banned from American skies.”\n\nMany in the drone industry expected a comprehensive examination of the technology to see if DJI drones contained secret back doors that shared information with entities in China. Instead, the decision appears to have been based on a simple review of what government agencies already knew.\n\nFor months, DJI has written letters to U.S. officials asking for a rigorous audit.\n\n“We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” Adam Welsh, head of global policy for DJI, wrote in a letter this month to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others.\n\nThe decision, while not unexpected, deeply disappointed drone pilots around the country, most of whom own and operate DJI equipment.\n\nDaCoda Bartels, chief operating officer of FlyGuys, a company that connects commercial drone pilots with freelance work around the country, said he owned the first DJI drone — the Phantom V-1 — and every updated version since then. Now, he faces the prospect of being cut off from the improvements that the company releases each year.\n\n“DJI as a company will still be innovating and offering their products in other countries,” Mr. Bartels said. “We just won’t have access to them. That’s unfortunate.”\n\nAmerican-made versions are four times as expensive, he said, and “half as good.”\n\nBut the announcement was cause for celebration for the fledgling American drone companies that pushed for such an opening.\n\n“This was a historic decision that will change everything for U.S. drone manufacturers,” said a statement from BRINC, a Seattle-based manufacturer that makes drones for public safety. “BRINC and our peer companies are ready to meet the call for service to rebuild the American drone industry.”\n\nAnother company that hopes to fill the void left by DJI is Skydio, a U.S. drone company that hired Joe Bartlett, Ms. Stefanik’s former national security adviser, as its director of federal policy. Mr. Bartlett is now the deputy under secretary in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which played a role in determining DJI’s fate. Skydio declined to comment.\n\nUnusual Machines, a Florida manufacturer of drone components, also stands to benefit from the decision. In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, its chief executive, Allan Evans, said the decision meant domestic manufacturers “have both an opportunity and a responsibility to build and deliver world-class products as quickly as possible.” Donald Trump Jr. sits on his advisory board.\n\nThe F.C.C. statement made clear that the decision does not affect drone pilots’ ability to fly the drones they already have or previously approved models.\n\n“There will be a window for American companies to catch up,” Mr. Bartels said. “I sure hope that they do.”",

    "description": "Romney is worth an estimated $254 million, and was among Congress's wealthiest members.",
    "fullText": "Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. senator from Utah, has long been known for fiscal conservatism and tax cuts. But in a Friday op-ed for The New York Times, he reversed course, calling for higher taxes on rich Americans like himself to address the looming national debt crisis and prevent the collapse of Social Security.\n\nRomney said the U.S. is headed for an economic cliff as the Social Security Trust Fund races toward insolvency in 2034, according to a projection from the CRFB. Without congressional intervention, benefits would be slashed by roughly 23%, forcing the government to borrow trillions at potentially exorbitant interest rates or print money that could trigger hyperinflation.​\n\n“Today, all of us, including our grandmas, truly are headed for a cliff,” he warned. “Typically, Democrats insist on higher taxes, and Republicans insist on lower spending. But given the magnitude of our national debt as well as the proximity of the cliff, both are necessary.”​\n\nAmerica’s national debt has swelled to more than $38 trillion; in 2025 alone, it increased by about $1.8 trillion. Last year, interest payments on the debt surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, exceeding spending on Medicare and national defense. Annual debt-servicing costs are projected to climb to $1.8 trillion over the next decade.\n\n​”DOGE took a slash-and-burn approach to budget cutting and failed spectacularly,” Romney wrote. Indeed, a Yale University Budget Lab report earlier this year said DOGE was likely costing the government more than it was saving.\n\nRomney devoted most of his op-ed to tax proposals aimed at high earners. He reversed his longstanding opposition to raising the income cap on payroll taxes, which currently stands at $176,100.\n\n“I long opposed increasing the income level on which FICA employment taxes are applied (this year, the cap is $176,100). No longer; the consequences of the cliff have changed my mind,” he explained.​\n\nThe 78-year-old former presidential candidate also called for closing what he described as tax “caverns” or “caves” that benefit multibillionaires. He singled out the step-up in basis provision, which allows heirs of large estates to avoid capital gains taxes on inherited assets. Using Tesla CEO Elon Musk as an example, Romney argued this loophole should be eliminated for estates valued above $100 million.\n\n“If he had originally purchased his Tesla stock with, say, $1 billion and held it until his death and if it was then worth $500 billion, he would never pay the 24% federal capital gains tax on the $499 billion profit,” he said. “Why? Because under the tax code, capital gains are not taxed at death. The tax code provision known as step-up in basis means that when Mr. Musk’s heirs get his stock, they are treated as if they purchased it for $500 billion. So no one pays taxes on the $499 billion capital gain. Ever.”",

Hundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.  “Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University.",
    "fullText": "LEXINGTON, Neb. (AP) — On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann’s Catholic Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping their town.\n\nA pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in Lexington, Nebraska.\n\n“Suddenly they tell us that there’s no more work. Your world closes in on you,” said Alejandra Gutierrez.\n\nShe and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the 3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.\n\nHundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.\n\n“Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University. It will be “close to the poster child for hard times.”\n\nAll told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to estimates from University of Nebraska, Lincoln, shared with The Associated Press. Tyson employees alone will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.\n\nTyson says it's closing the plant to “right-size” its beef business after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company’s expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.\n\nThe plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children in a safe community and sent them to college.\n\nNow, those symbols of economic progress — mortgages and car payments, property taxes and tuition costs — are bills that thousands of Tyson workers won't have an income to pay.\n\nAt St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.\n\n“At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,” Gutierrez said. “Because where would we get the money to pay for college?”\n\nA tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and then down at her hands.\n\nIf you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington — called “Lex” by locals — would be just about bullseye.\n\nIt's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.\n\nThe plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later, attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's population within a decade.\n\nMany came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called “a little ghost town.\"\n\nBut soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery; locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation centers.\n\nTo this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup lines and the one-screen movie theater showing “Polar Express.”\n\n“It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place,” said Yanes. “Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave.”\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as 5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels “like a funeral,” she said.\n\n“Tyson was our motherland,\" said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a question he has no answer to: “Which state are we gonna go, daddy?”\n\nThe only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a parent working for Tyson.\n\nThe school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit community, where young people return to raise families.\n\nDuring Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his future employment options with a sad smile.\n\nAfter the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though “now there's no future.\" He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and tried to explain his emotions.\n\n“It’s home mostly, not the job,” he said, replacing his glasses with an embarrassed smile.\n\n“We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex,” he said. “Otherwise Lex is gonna disappear.”\n\nThe domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip town, said economist Hicks — who wouldn't be surprised if it were double that — seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and other businesses.\n\nMost of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez’s mustachioed grin and bellow of “Hola, amigo!”\n\nMartinez’s grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in tears.\n\nIf he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but “there’s just nowhere we can go,\" said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson will change its mind.\n\nHe knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it “is currently assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production network.” It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer support to the community through the plant closure.\n\nMany, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee of comparable jobs.\n\n“Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility here to help ease some of the impact,” he said, noting Tyson doesn't pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.\n\n‘It’s not easy, at our age, to go back and start over’\n\nNear the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers recently filled a long hall as state agencies — responding with the urgency of a natural disaster — offered information on retraining, writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when selling homes.\n\nAttendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor’s prognosis. “Your financial health is going to change,\" they were told. “Don’t ignore the bank, they will not go away.”\n\nMany of the older workers don’t speak English, haven’t graduated high school and aren’t computer savvy. The last application some filled out was decades ago.\n\n“We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don’t have any other experience,” said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.\n\nBack at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.\n\n“They only want young people now,” said Juventino Castro, who's worked at Tyson for a quarter-century. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the time I have left.”\n\nLupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won’t last long. Luz Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.\n\n“It won’t be easy,” said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years who sat with his wife. “We started here from scratch and it’s time to start from scratch again.\"\n\nTears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.",

    "description": "Once worth millions, these abandoned mansions and castles around the world fell into ruin after fires, wars, and financial collapse.",
    "fullText": "When they were built, these lavish homes bore ornate examples of their owners' wealth, from towering turrets to marble archways.\n\nEach of these properties — once worth millions — has faced misfortune, such as the financial ruin of their owners or failed preservation efforts.\n\nWhile some have been restored to resemble their former glory or have opened to visitors, others have been deemed too dangerous to visit and too costly to repair.\n\nHere are eight abandoned mansions around the world — and what happened to them.\n\nKatie Warren, Libertina Brandt, and Taylor Ardrey contributed to earlier versions of this story.\n\nBuilt in 1912 by railroad magnate James H. Dooley, the Swannanoa mansion in Lyndhurst, Virginia, is an Italian Renaissance-style villa overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nDooley built the mansion as a summer house for his wife. The villa was converted into a country club for a few years after the couple's deaths, but it was abandoned by 1932 as the Great Depression reached its peak, per the mansion's website.\n\nThe mansion was purchased by a couple and converted into a museum while they resided there. Since their deaths in 1988, the mansion has sat vacant.\n\nToday, the mansion is a local attraction and wedding venue, offering public tours once a month from May to November.\n\nLocal residents have raised concerns over the conditions of the estate, local News Leader newspaper reported in 2015. In 2024, Andy Florance, CEO of CoStar, purchased the nearby Swannanoa Golf and Country Club, with plans for preservation.\n\nThe Cambusnethan House in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, is one of the last remaining Gothic mansions in Scotland.\n\nBuilt in 1819, the mansion belonged to the Lockhart family of Castlehill and was built to replace an early 17th-century house that burned down in 1810, per Scotland's Buildings at Risk Register.\n\nIn the 1970s, the house was used for mock medieval banquets, but it was further damaged by fire in the 1980s.\n\nA group called \"Friends of Cambusnethan Priory\" was established in 2014 to try to save the building, which is categorized at a \"critical\" risk level by Scotland's Buildings at Risk Register, from any further deterioration.\n\nLynnewood Hall, a 110-room, century-old Gilded Age mansion located just outside Philadelphia, was designed by Horace Trumbauer in the late 1890s.\n\nWhen he built the mansion, industrialist Peter A. B. Widener intended to reside there alongside his two sons and their families.\n\nHowever, his son George Dunton Widener, alongside his wife, Eleanor Elkins, and their son, Harry, were passengers on the Titanic when it sank. Only Eleanor survived.\n\nThe mansion was inherited by Peter's surviving son, Joseph, who died in 1943. Various owners acquired the property after that, including the First Korean Church of New York, which listed the property for sale in 2014.\n\nThe mansion remained vacant for years after.\n\nThe mansion, which cost about $325 million in today's currency when it was built in 1897, was documented as being in a dilapidated state, and repairs were estimated to cost up to $40 million in 2012.\n\nIn June 2023, the mansion was purchased for $9 million (or about $9.6 million in 2025 currency, adjusted for inflation) by the Lynnewood Hall Preservation Foundation, which aims to restore it to its former glory.\n\nPidhirtsi Castle in the Lviv region of Ukraine was built as a leisure home for a high-ranking Polish military commander between 1635 and 1640 by Italian architect Andrea dell'Aqua, per the World Monuments Fund.\n\nThe mansion prospered for years, but in the 19th century, new owners took over and neglected the castle, so that by the end of World War II, it had significantly deteriorated.\n\nPidhirtsi Castle has been damaged by fire and flooding over the years.\n\nPreservation efforts have enabled the restoration of part of the mansion, which has also hosted events such as exhibitions and concerts in recent years.\n\nThe McNeal mansion, situated along the Delaware River in New Jersey, was constructed by industrialist Andrew McNeal in 1890, following his establishment of a pipe plant and foundry.\n\nUS Pipe bought the property in 1899 and used it as its headquarters until 1953. In the subsequent decades, it was abandoned.\n\nToday, the mansion is collapsing in on itself, posing a danger to the urban explorers who visit.\n\nThe Villa de Vecchi, known as the \"Ghost Mansion\" of Italy, was built between 1854 and 1857. It was meant to be the summer home of a Count named Felix De Vecchi, who was head of the Italian National Guard. The home had all the modern amenities of the time, including indoor heating pipes and a large pressurized fountain.\n\nA 2002 landslide destroyed nearby homes, but the once-lavish and now-battered \"Ghost Mansion\" remained standing.\n\nSitting just outside Camdenton, Missouri, the ruins of Ha Ha Tonka resemble an ancient European castle. The mansion was built by Kansas City businessman Robert Snyder at the turn of the century.\n\nSnyder started building in 1905, but he never saw the house finished as he died in a car crash the following year. His sons took over the construction and lived there until the family ran out of money due to the several lawsuits surrounding the castle's property.\n\nIn 1942, parts of the castle burned down and sat abandoned until the state of Missouri bought the property for use as a state park in 1978.\n\nBuilt by Scottish entrepreneur Francis Bannerman VI in 1901, the Bannerman Castle sits on Pollepel Island in New York's Hudson River.\n\nRather than living in the castle, Bannerman used it as storage for his business's military weapons arsenal.\n\nAfter the powder house exploded in 1920, the upkeep of the castle dwindled. It was eventually acquired by the Hudson Highlands State Park Reserve.\n\nIn 1992, the Bannerman Castle Trust was established to repair the ruins. Since then, it has raised over $1 million to refurbish the castle, which is now open to the public for tours.\n\nDuring her 2019 visit, Business Insider's Joey Hadden said visitors were told to stay at least 100 feet away from the castle due to its deterioration. Still, it was worth the visit.\n\n\"The combination of medieval architecture and overgrown trees and foliage makes Bannerman Castle a sight worth visiting up close,\" she wrote.",

    "fullText": "What's better: $120,000 for a remote job or $240,000 in the office?\n\nThat question was first posed to the creator Tinx, who recounted it in a viral TikTok. The post now has over 5 million views, and a comments section of over 18,000 people debating RTOs and perks.\n\nRemote work remains a flash point for workplace debate. Instagram ordered five days in office starting in February, and TikTok has a five-day RTO coming down soon, too. Other companies advertise their remote-first status in an effort to attract top talent.\n\nTinx made her stance clear: take the extra money.\n\n\"What do you guys think goes on at the office?\" she asked. \"It's not that scary.\"\n\nSome popular comments disagree. \"$120k remote any day. My mental health is more important,\" reads one comment.\n\n\"The office is THAT bad,\" another reads.\n\nThe video also led to a load of spin-off TikToks, where creators make their case for one job or another.\n\n\"Be serious,\" creator Toni Childs said. \"That's a $70,000 difference after taxes. That's what you're giving up.\"\n\nTikToker Rai Tryna also said to accept the $240,00: \"You can put yourself so far ahead, just by working at that job a couple more years.\"\n\n$120k vs $240k FOR THE SAME JOB? Y’all gotta be lying #fyp #remotework #corporate\n\nMcKenzie Mark said that she would take the $120,000 remote role. Mark said she works in tech as a fully remote employee making $118,000, and has gotten offers that would bring her pay to $250,000.\n\n\"Working remote is not something I'm willing to compromise on,\" Mark said. \"I was able to fully sell my car and become a one-car household with my partner, who also works remote.\"\n\nI would rather work remote for $120,000 than be in an office full-time for $240,000 🫢💸💻 #remote #wfh #workfromhome #returntooffice #corporate\n\nChanelle Howell agreed: \"You'd have to pay me so much more money than 240 to be in-office five days a week.\"\n\nThe debate also migrated to X. When Lindsay Stamp posted about it, her comments were flooded with opposing takes. \"Take that extra money and buy your freedom in half the time,\" wrote one commenter. \"Yep. Remote,\" wrote another.\n\nFor parents, remote work may also be more highly valued for the flexibility it brings for childcare duties. One creator said that choosing the $120,000 option should only apply to those who \"two or more kids under the age of four.\"\n\n\"If i was single, I'd take the 240,\" Kaylin Patschke commented on Tinx's video. \"As a working mom, i'd take the 120.\"\n\nIn her original TikTok, Tinx also said that she could immediately guess the questioner's age: Gen Z. The office may do the generation some good, she said.\n\n\"It'll make you all less weird,\" Tinx said.\n\nGen Z's social awkwardness has long been a topic of debate on the internet. In July, the \"Gen Z Stare\" went viral on TikTok, showcasing the wide-eyed look some young people give in public when responding to basic small talk.\n\nIs Gen Z really that against in-office work? It depends on who you ask.\n\nSome Gen Zers are gravitating toward remote jobs, such as customer service, with their promise of a better work-life balance. Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan, who is a member of Gen Z herself, wrote that she found the pre-pandemic 9-to-5 job \"soul-crushing.\"\n\nBut many are actually desperate to get to their cubicle. Gen Z workers from Goldman Sachs and Google told Business Insider that they wanted to work in person. Some young people have gone back to the office, only to find their managers working remotely. And, who knows — they might even fall in love in the office.",

    "title": "Why the weirdest sea level changes on Earth are happening off the coast of Japan",
    "description": "In recent years, a major ocean current changed its path in two crucial ways. Now parts of the sea are rising, other parts are falling, ocean temperatures are breaking records — and Japan’s iconic fishing industry is in trouble.",
    "fullText": "Chris Mooney is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a CNN Climate contributor. He is currently a professor of practice in the Environmental Institute at the University of Virginia.\n\nBathtubs and pools mislead us about the ocean: Its surface is anything but flat.\n\nSeas pile up in some spots, pushed by trade winds or pulled by gravity toward big things like ice sheets. Amid it all, at the western end of large ocean basins, the fastest surface currents — veins of warm water — race toward the poles, causing additional slopes at the surface.\n\nThe ocean is uneven to begin with, and its unevenness is also changing. Maps of recent changes show intricate patterns of watery hills and valleys, but also call attention to one extraordinary location. Off the coast of Japan, one region of the ocean has been rising by nearly an inch every year, right next to another where it has been falling even faster.\n\nIt’s the fingerprint of one of those surface currents changing its location, an event that has had dramatic repercussions. The Kuroshio, or “Black Current,” is one of the largest streams of water anywhere in the world, and its recent movement has triggered record-warm ocean temperatures and upended fisheries, an indelible staple of Japanese culture. Scientists say the warm waters have even amplified heatwaves on land and driven extreme rainfall.\n\nAnd while there are signs some of the changes are now waning, fishing communities say they aren’t yet back to normal. Meanwhile, scientists worry it could be a sign of more volatility to come.\n\nThe position of the current could keep fluctuating, said Bo Qiu, a leading Kuroshio expert at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. “It’s hard to predict the future, but given the data we have so far, I can only see the intensity becoming larger and larger,” he said.\n\nThe deep, warm Kuroshio transports more than 200 times as much water as the Amazon River, traveling north from the equator and normally banking east around Japan’s Boso peninsula, near Tokyo. Here, it becomes known as the Kuroshio Extension as it heads into the open Pacific.\n\nBut in recent years, the current has been behaving in anything but the usual way, and the Extension, in particular, made a major divergence along Japan’s coast. Its northern edge shifted as much as 300 miles farther poleward, leading to unprecedented warm waters in the surrounding region.\n\n“I was so surprised I don’t even know if ‘surprised’ is the right word,” said Shusaku Sugimoto, an associate professor at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, a northern coastal city.\n\nSugimoto led a study analyzing ocean temperatures off the coast in locations the Extension didn’t historically reach, but has in recent years. “The fact that the temperature rose 6 degrees (Celsius) off the Sanriku coast, and the elevated temperature persisted for two years, represents a level of water temperature rise we’ve never seen before,” he said.\n\nIn August of 2017, the Kuroshio current south of Japan settled into a “large meander” pattern, leaving the coastline and looping southward, taking its warm waters with it. This big shift in water temperatures south of Japan changes the distributions of fish species offshore.\n\nLarge meanders themselves are a well-known recurring feature of the current, explained Shinichiro Kida, an oceanographer at Kyushu University. Records of these events date back to the 1960s. During a lengthy meander event from 1975 to 1980, scientists saw a severe decline in anchovy in the Enshunada Sea, a major fishing region to the south of Japan’s main island of Honshu. The anchovy were replaced by sardines, which favor the warmer water the current brought to the region.\n\nBut no Kuroshio large meander that we know of has lasted as long as this one. In August, the Japan Meteorological Agency finally declared that it had ended after nearly eight years. But overall both changes have had a big effect on this country that is home to more than 100 million.\n\nThe meander and the Extension shift are connected, Qiu said. He co-authored a new paper in the Journal of Climate arguing as much, and calling the configuration a “new dynamic regime.”\n\n“I’ve been working on the Kuroshio Extension for more than three decades,” Qiu said. “I never expected this.”\n\nAs the Kuroshio powers along, it not only brings warmer water but also, depending on its location, higher sea level. There can be a several-foot difference between ocean heights on different sides of the current, thanks to its warmth and speed .\n\nBut because of these factors, any new movement of the current can have dramatic effects.\n\nThe large meander, for example, triggered a sea level fall in one region and pronounced sea level rise — by as much as half a foot — along the coast of the island of Honshu south of Tokyo. In October of 2017, when Typhoon Lan struck the Shizuoka Prefecture along this coastline, the higher sea level amplified the damage, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.\n\nIt is not only the height of the sea: As the Kuroshio is a warm current, and one traveling northward into cooler waters, its arrival in a new location has enormous effects on ocean temperatures.\n\nThe big question is how much the recent phenomena are part of a natural cycle, and how much it’s influenced by something else, like climate change. (And how much it’s both, combined.)\n\nThe impact of climate change on the large meander is unclear, because of its long history. But as far as the Extension shift goes, there are mounting reasons to implicate greenhouse gases and a changing climate.\n\nTo understand the recent changes in the Kuroshio is to understand how water moves through the world’s oceans, especially the large rotating “gyres” found in the world’s major ocean basins.\n\nFive of these basins — North and South Pacific, North and South Atlantic, and Indian — feature a similar pattern. Warm water travels west along the equator, then turns toward the poles. The currents carrying the warm water north or south on poleward transits are called “western boundary currents,” and they include the Kuroshio and its four famed cousins: the Gulf Stream, the Brazil, the East Australian, and the Agulhas.\n\nScientists are now seeing most of these currents changing in a similar way — getting warmer and pushing even farther poleward.\n\nThis change is rooted in a phenomenon known as the Hadley Cell, a global zone of warm, rising air across the tropics. It’s now expanding due to climate change.\n\n“This expansion shifts not just rainfall patterns but also the zones of sinking air that anchor high-pressure systems, such as the Pacific High,” explains Brown University climate scientist Emanuele Di Lorenzo.\n\nIn the middle latitudes, these massive high-pressure systems are the driving force behind currents like the Kuroshio. So, when the winds move, the currents do too.\n\nBoth models and data suggest the Kuroshio Extension, in particular, has been moving north partly because of the atmospheric shift, Di Lorenzo explained.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2021, driven by wind changes, the northern edge of the Kuroshio Extension shifted north by about 130 miles, a recent study found. This was before an even larger shift in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe Kuroshio Extension’s leap in 2023 and 2024 was an extreme event. The northern edge reached nearly to the northern tip of Honshu, Japan’s largest island. In a different study, Sugimoto and colleagues with the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Meteorological Research Institute took oceanographic measurements in the Extension’s new location. They found water as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual, extending to a depth of around 400 meters, or 1,300 feet.\n\nThe authors note that for an entire year and a half between April 2023 and August 2024, the region saw “intense marine heatwave conditions almost every day.”\n\nAnd it was not just in the water: the Japan Meteorological Agency also found that the extreme ocean conditions contributed to record summer heat over land in northern Japan in 2023. Another group of scientists, meanwhile, linked the warm offshore current to extreme rainfall over Japan’s Chiba Prefecture, near Tokyo, in September of 2023.\n\nThese ocean changes have altered the distributions of fish populations along Japan’s Pacific Coast, creating extreme impacts on Japan’s iconic fisheries.\n\nIn central Japan, for instance, a major mackerel fishery was upended, and fishers say that even though the large meander has now ended, that doesn’t mean things can instantly go back to the way they were.\n\n“Immediate recovery is not a reality, and while conditions may gradually improve, at present, there has been no recovery in catches,” said Osamu Nagai, executive director of the Mie Gaiwan (Outer Bay) Fisheries Cooperative Association.\n\n“The catch has fallen to less than half of what it was 10 years ago — we’re now only catching about 20 to 30 percent of the mackerel. This is a major blow,” Nagai said.\n\nNortheastern Japan’s Sanriku coast, known for its rich fisheries, is a different story, but still a bad one. Here, the southward flowing Oyashio current traditionally brings down cool waters and supports rich fisheries. But when the Kuroshio Extension moved northward into this region, it displaced the Oyashio, bringing on a stark change in ocean temperature.\n\nAnd it is not just fish species, like Pacific salmon and saury, that became harder to catch.\n\n“What matters most is the foundation of Japan’s most important food culture, which is the flavor made out of Kombu seaweed — it can only be harvested in Hokkaido, near Japan,” said Yoshihiro Tachibana, a professor who specializes in climate dynamics at Mie University.\n\n“Kombu stocks are declining dramatically. Dashi (the fundamental Japanese soup stock) culture might collapse. It’s declining. We can’t get any at all. So I believe this has a tremendous impact on our food culture as well,” he said.\n\nRecently, the northern edge of the Kuroshio extension has retreated a bit. It has moved back to around 37 degrees North Latitude, according to Qiu. That’s still a high location historically, but hardly as extreme as before.\n\nBut the questions remain: what do these extreme ocean events mean, how they are linked to climate change? For at least one researcher, they’re an early sign of things to come.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity to learn what the oceans will be like 100 years from now,” said Sugimoto, of Tohoku University in the northeastern region of Honshu, Japan’s largest island.\n\n“An unprecedented ocean phenomenon is now occurring by chance in Tohoku,” he continued. “Understanding how this has altered the seas of Tohoku offers a chance to understand how the world’s oceans will change in the future.”\n\nElisabeth Doty contributed to this report.",

    "description": "This winter, popular fragrances will include sweet gourmands, cozy amber, citruses, and heady, narcotic scents, according to professional perfumers.",
    "fullText": "When the chill sets in and you find yourself swapping lightweight sweaters and trench coats for bulky jackets, don't forget to give your fragrance shelf a seasonal refresh, too.\n\nWinter fragrances often lean richer, warmer, and more enveloping — think amber, spice, woods, and heady florals that wrap around you like a cozy, knitted blanket.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three perfumers about which scents they love for winter and why. From narcotic florals to warm ambers, here's what they said about their seasonal favorites.\n\nAmber fragrances provide some coziness in cold weather.\n\nDana Schmitt, New York City-based perfumer at the fragrance company Givaudan, said that one of her longtime favorites is Chanel Coromandel, a soft yet luxurious scent. It's a plush, amber perfume anchored by patchouli and frankincense.\n\nAnother staple she recommends is REPLICA's Jazz Club, a classic scent built on rich, spicy, and woody notes.\n\nIt evokes the feeling of settling into a dim jazz lounge on a chilly winter night in the city — making it perfect for a romantic date night.\n\nGourmands — including vanilla, caramel, and honey — are just so cozy for winter, bringing warmth and comfort when the temperatures drop.\n\nBryson Ammons, New York City-based perfumer and founder of The Alloy Studio, likes to push the category a bit further by incorporating a bit of spice.\n\nHe really enjoys Amphora Parfum Honeycakes, a sweet yet savory scent that feels both nostalgic and surprising. \"It's like a spiced coffee — a very sticky, syrupy fragrance,\" he said.\n\nFor something more amber-forward but still gourmand, Schmitt points to Mugler Angel Eau de Parfum, a sweet, praline scent that also features signature notes of patchouli and bergamot.\n\nWinters can be cold. When it's under 30 degrees, New York City-based independent perfumer Asia Grant likes leaning into narcotic, smooth fragrances that feel like wrapping yourself in cashmere and tucking into a dim, cozy library.\n\nRich musks and heady florals really come alive in cold weather, and also add a brooding, dark-academia vibe that pairs well with chunky sweaters and penny loafers.\n\nGrant recommends Dominique Ropion's Carnal Flower, an intoxicating, full-bodied fragrance that features notes of melon, tuberose, and white musk.\n\nBecause it's so highly concentrated, she often likes layering it with lighter, fresher scents to balance it out.\n\nLemons, oranges, limes, and grapefruits might make you think \"summer,\" but they're technically winter-blooming fruits, which makes them a natural fit for cold-weather fragrances, said Ammons.\n\nThey also add a bit of brightness and zing to the chillier months.\n\nAlthough spicy and ambery scents are a given for winter, Ammons likes to shake things up with fresh, woodsy one. Think: light florals, clean laundry, freshly-fallen snow, and a wisp of smoke.\n\nOne of his go-tos is Aesop's Rozu Eau De Parfum, which pairs notes of rose and bergamot with sandalwood and musk.\n\n\"There's something clean and kind of chic about it,\" Ammons said.",

    "title": "Relentless earthquake swarms rattle California. What does that mean for the Big One?",
    "description": "For more than a month, the Bay Area has been subjected to a seemingly ceaseless stampede of earthquakes, rattling windows and raising fears across California.",
    "fullText": "For more than a month, the Bay Area has been subjected to a seemingly ceaseless stampede of earthquakes — the latest in a series of seismic swarms that have rattled windows and raised fears across California.\n\nThe latest swarm has been centered in the East Bay suburb of San Ramon, where a magnitude 4 earthquake struck Friday night — the largest since the cluster began — and a magnitude 3.9 on Saturday night. Since Nov. 9, there have been at least 80 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater in the area, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nWhile none of these quakes has been particularly potent — which was also the case in similar swarms recorded in Malibu, El Sereno and Ontario since 2024 — some fear the persistent seismic activity could foreshadow a back-of-mind concern for many Californians: the \"Big One.\"\n\nBut while experts acknowledge that some major earthquakes are preceded by more-modest temblors, they caution that the swarms by themselves probably don't offer a hint of when, or where, the next major quake will hit.\n\n\"There's gonna be a big earthquake in the Bay Area. We just can't say exactly when and where. So you should be prepared for that,\" said Annemarie Baltay, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist.\n\nThe threat of a large earthquake always looms in California regardless of the appearance of small shakers. There is a 60% chance of an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater in the Los Angeles region by 2043, and a 72% chance of the same in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to 30-year estimates calculated by USGS in 2014.\n\nAcross California, there's also a 48% chance of a magnitude 7.5 quake or greater by 2043, and a 7% chance of a magnitude 8 or greater quake.\n\nIt is true that after every earthquake, there's a 1-in-20 chance it'll be followed by a larger magnitude temblor. But conventionally, only half of earthquakes have an easily detectable foreshock, while the other half do not.\n\nSouthern California has provided some recent examples of swarms that ultimately fizzled out. The Malibu area had a trio of scary earthquakes recently — a magnitude 4.6 earthquake on Feb. 9, 2024; a magnitude 4.7 on Sept. 12, 2024; and a magnitude 4.1 on March 9. But it has been quieter in the last six months.\n\nOntario endured a spate of shaking a little more than a year ago, topping out with a magnitude 4 quake on Oct. 6, 2024. But there have been fewer, much smaller quakes so far this year.\n\nAn earthquake swarm centered around El Sereno in Eastside Los Angeles also was detected last year, though that activity appears to have subsided following a magnitude 4.4 earthquake on Aug. 12, 2024.\n\nThe cluster of small San Ramon earthquakes in recent weeks is also not terribly unusual. The earthquakes are appearing on the northern end of the Calaveras fault as it runs into Mount Diablo.\n\nIncluding the current swarm and another last month, there have been nine earthquake swarms in the surrounding area since 1970. They have lasted anywhere from two to 42 days, with maximum magnitudes generally in the 3 to 4 range, according to Baltay.\n\n\"This is still really consistent with these kinds of swarms,\" Baltay said of the current activity.\n\nCertainly, for residents who feel the frequent small earthquakes, \"it's really unsettling ... you don't know when it's going to end,\" she said.\n\nNone of those earlier swarms resulted in a major quake on the northern section of the Calaveras fault, which hasn't ruptured catastrophically in modern history.\n\nStill, the Calaveras fault is one to watch for California. It's considered one of the most likely faults to rupture in a major quake for the Bay Area, and has the potential to trigger a magnitude 6.7 quake or greater. In 1984, a section of the Calaveras fault ruptured and caused the magnitude 6.2 Morgan Hill earthquake, which resulted in 21 minor injuries and $7.5 million in damage.\n\nAlso of concern are the Hayward fault and the notorious San Andreas fault, according to the USGS.\n\nThe smattering of small earthquakes in Southern California generated significant, not altogether unwarranted, attention last year.\n\nIn fact, 2024 ended up being a record of sorts for modest quakes in Southern California — there were 15 independent earthquake sequences that year with at least one magnitude 4 or higher earthquake, according to seismologist Lucy Jones. That was the highest total in 65 years, surpassing the 13 seen in 1988.\n\nBut last year's figure probably didn't mean much in the greater scheme of things. In 2025, there have been only five independent seismic sequences with at least one magnitude 4 or higher earthquake in Southern California.\n\nThat said, there have been situations when relatively modest quakes have preceded huge ones.\n\nIn 1857, a mammoth magnitude 7.8 earthquake ruptured along 225 miles of the San Andreas fault, stretching from Monterey County to Los Angeles County. That Big One hit at around 8:30 a.m. on Jan. 9, 1857, but it was preceded in Monterey County by a magnitude 5.6 earthquake an hour earlier, and a magnitude 6.1 earthquake an hour before that.\n\nAnd then there were the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in the Mojave Desert. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake ruptured July 4 at 10:33 a.m., but that was followed by a much larger magnitude 7.1 earthquake at 8:19 p.m. the next day.\n\nThere were also a few harrowing months in 1992. A magnitude 6.1 Joshua Tree temblor on April 22 of that year made scientists nervous because its epicenter was only about 6 miles away from the San Andreas fault. After the Joshua Tree earthquake, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services issued an advisory for Southern California, warning people to be on alert for another, larger earthquake.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, \"nothing happened, but we kept on having all these aftershocks sitting there right near the San Andreas and making us uncomfortable and worrying about it,\" Jones said. The aftershocks eventually migrated north, away from the San Andreas.\n\nBut those aftershocks crept toward the eventual epicenter of a far more powerful earthquake in the Mojave Desert — the magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake of June 28, 1992. That quake resulted in aftershocks that also reactivated seismic activity around Joshua Tree.\n\n\"So we now had a continuous line of aftershocks coming all the way down to the San Andreas,\" Jones said.\n\nHours after the Landers earthquake, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck in Big Bear, \"which was on a different fault, but also the aftershocks to Big Bear extended down to the San Andreas in a different location,\" Jones said.\n\nThe result was so alarming to scientists and officials that the Governor's Office of Emergency Services issued what was then an unprecedented advisory urging people to stay off freeways, a call that came as freeway and bridge collapses from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake were still on the minds of many.\n\nNothing ended up happening on the San Andreas fault in 1992, however.\n\n\"It's probably the closest we've come to a prediction, ever,\" Jones said. \"We were really pretty nervous about it.\"\n\nHowever, there have been other major earthquakes with no easily noticeable foreshocks, Jones said. Those include some of the most destructive in recent memory, such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and the 1971 Sylmar earthquake.\n\nA.

None of the other companies responded to a request for comment from Business Insider, and the videos saying they're of the parties have not been verified.\n\nThe post about KPMG's party includes a figure skating performance, drinks, and oysters lying on a bed of ice. A post that said it was of Deloitte's event also featured a figure skating show, with a group of performers in yellow dresses, rather than the duet performance for KPMG employees. In terms of food, the apparent Deloitte bash offered bubbly, oysters, and a dish featuring truffle mushrooms, according to one video.\n\nA representative for KPMG said that the firm's New York City holiday party took place at The Overview, an event space in the Javits Center, and featured live music, a holiday menu, and photo stations. In San Fransico, the Cirque du Soleil-themed party was at the San Francisco Design Center.\n\nQuand ton cabinet décide d’organiser sa soirée de Noël au Grand Palais ❄️⛸️🤍 #christmas #party #deloitte #big4 #patinaje\n\nA video that said it showed a PWC bash in New York City features a disco ball, dance floor, full bar, strips of rare steak, and accessories befitting a typical middle school graduation party, like light-up shutter shades and necklaces. (The TikToker told Business Insider the video is not affiliated with their work at PWC.)\n\nSome of Elon Musk's companies also pulled out all the stops, according to social media. TikTok videos that said they showed SpaceX's holiday party included a rave around a Mars-themed stage — fitting since the rocket company aims to reach the red planet by 2026. There seemed to be carnival rides, sledding on fake snow, and performers dancing in cyber trucks.\n\nBoss threw a little holiday party for the team🚀 #spacex #holidayparty2025\n\nThe party appeared to take place in an outdoor arena, as some can be seen milling around largely empty bleachers in another video.\n\nxAI employees hung out with Optimus robots, according to posts on X.

The future cookbook author was immediately interested.\n\n\"He saw me on the street and then sent me a letter with a photograph of himself in it,\" she told People in 2018. \"I just remember running through the house and going, 'Mom, Mom, you've got to see this picture of this guy. He's so cute!'\"\n\nAfter Jeffrey picked up Ina, who was still in high school at the time, he drove them over to a bar in Port Chester, New York, where the legal drinking age was 18.\n\n\"It was a disaster,\" she told Food Network. \"I had never been to a bar in my life! The guy at the door says, 'Where's your ID?' and I thought, 'What ID?'\"\n\nThey ended up going to a coffee shop instead, where they had a \"perfectly good time,\" according to Jeffrey.\n\nAfter they were married, Ina and Jeffrey Garten settled in North Carolina after Jeffrey enlisted in the Army. With no plans to continue her studies at Syracuse University, Ina focused on cooking for her husband.\n\nHowever, Jeffrey pushed her to pursue her passions for business and cooking, and she ended up getting her pilot's certificate on the side.\n\n\"We were part of the first generation where there was a fork in the road for a lot of women, whether to pursue their careers or stay at home,\" Jeffrey told People in 2018. \"Ina was a cross between the two. She would send me brownies in a shoebox when I was in college and make me sweaters, but it never crossed my mind that she wouldn't also do something really interesting professionally.\"\n\n\"I wrote to Ina every single day,\" he told People in 2018 of his time stationed in Thailand. \"During the whole year, I was only able to call her once.\"\n\nIna saved all the letters and has spoken about reflecting on them 50 years after the pair tied the knot. One of Jeffrey's letters mentioned how he'd love to take her to Paris, despite not having enough money for a hotel.\n\nParis still holds a special place in the couple's hearts and is where they've spent their anniversary every year.\n\nUsing all the ingredients France had to offer, Ina prepared all their meals on a small gas camping stove.\n\n\"I had always thought about French food as 'cuisine' with complicated preparations and slowly simmered sauces,\" Garten wrote in her cookbook \"Cooking for Jeffrey,\" according to Bon Appétit. \"I discovered French street markets and simple, seasonal food that was based on incredibly good ingredients.\"\n\n\"It was the first formative period in her cooking,\" Jeffrey told Food Network. \"All those little shops in Europe — the boulangeries — Ina would walk through them and just glow.\"\n\nWhen they returned home, Ina began working her way through Julia Child's \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" in order to hone her skills.\n\nWhile in DC, Ina Garten spent her days earning her degree from Georgetown University and later working at the White House Office of Management and Budget. Jeffrey, meanwhile, worked in the State Department. At night, the Gartens entertained their throngs of friends at weekly dinner parties.\n\n\"People still talk about her parties,\" Jeffrey told Food Network. \"They were legendary.\"\n\nGarten worked under both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, helping to write the nuclear energy budget.\n\nIna Garten and Jeffrey decided early on in their relationship not to have children.\n\n\"It was a choice I made very early,\" Garten said during an appearance on Katie Couric's podcast in 2017. \"We decided not to have children. I really appreciate that other people do and we will always have friends that have children that we are close to...\" Garten explained. \"I really felt, I feel, that I would have never been able to have the life I've had. So it's a choice and that was the choice I made.\"\n\n\"We don't have any children. I'm her family,\" Jeffrey told Johns Hopkins Magazine in 2016.\n\n\"When I told [Jeffrey] I wanted to move to New York and open a food store, he said, 'Let's move to New York!'\" Garten told People in 2018. \"That he would not object to moving to a different state for my career was so unusual, particularly 40 years ago.\"\n\nIt became her new passion project and would be the key to launching her to superstardom.\n\n\"Jeffrey said, 'If you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten told the New York Times' Sam Sifton during a virtual chat for the release of \"Modern Comfort Food.\" \"And that's the best advice anybody ever gave me.\"\n\nJeffrey also kept busy and worked his way to becoming the managing director at Lehman Brothers.\n\nThe pair briefly separated in the late 1970s as they navigated the pressures of Garten's new business venture.\n\nDuring that period, Jeffrey was working in Washington, DC, while Ina was building her own professional path with the Barefoot Contessa store.\n\n\"When I bought Barefoot Contessa, I shattered our traditional roles —­ took a baseball bat to them and left them in pieces,\" Garten wrote in her memoir, People reported. \"While I was still cooking, cleaning, shopping, managing at the store, I was doing it as a businesswoman, not a wife. My responsibilities made it impossible for me to even think about anything else.\"\n\nShe asked Jeffrey for a temporary separation while she figured out how to balance being both a businesswoman and a wife, and he came to terms with the fact that Garten had a flourishing career that would limit her time spent at home.\n\nThe separation was short-lived, and the couple ultimately reconciled.\n\nWhile Jeffrey was on business for Lehman Brothers in Tokyo, Garten did the same thing for his apartment there, even going so far as to hire a Japanese artist to replicate his desk chair.\n\nTheir Southport, Connecticut, home looks almost identical to how it did over 20 years ago, except for a few personal touches courtesy of Jeffrey.\n\n\"Ina doesn't like any evidence of her public life,\" he told Food Network, \"so I collect all the newspaper and magazine articles. The walls are covered with pictures of Ina.\"\n\nAs a first-time author, Garten was new to the publishing business and wasn't sure the book would be successful. However, her husband was always supportive.\n\n\"She has natural talent, but it's backed by so much effort and so much focus,\" he said. \"When she had the store, she'd work until midnight all the time. The discipline of her recipe testing and how seriously she takes it — she doesn't settle for anything but the best. She's like a runner who collapses at the finish line even though she was ahead the whole race.\"\n\nHer hard work paid off — the first initial 5,000 copies of \"The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook,\" plus an extra 15,000 the publisher ordered in advance because of strong press engagement, sold out almost immediately.\n\n\"We're always texting each other and calling,\" she told People. \"But I have to say I really look forward to Thursday or Friday when he comes home and the weekends are sacrosanct.\"\n\n\"When we're not together, I'll send her five or six texts per day,\" Jeffrey said. \"I love looking at her schedule. I can envision where she is and what she's doing, and it doesn't feel like we're apart. If I could be with her seven days a week, 24 hours a day, that would be my ideal.\"\n\n\"I feel like I prepared my whole life to be quarantined, or working towards a place where we could be quarantined,\" the Barefoot Contessa told People in September 2020. \"Jeffrey writes and he teaches remotely, and I think [he] is going to look back on these days as the good old days. I make him lunch, I make him dinner and he's home all the time.\"\n\n\"He would always leave on Monday and come back on Friday and I stayed in one place,\" Ina said. \"I always wondered what it was going to be like when he retired. And when this happened, I thought, oh, I guess that's what it's going to be like ... I have to say, it's great.\"\n\nIn February 2021, Garten revealed how she and Jeffrey found pockets of joy during lockdown.\n\n\"Lunch date! Jeffrey and I make PB&Js, drive down to the beach, sit in the car, and listen to the podcast The Daily,\" Ina Garten captioned an Instagram post of her and Jeffrey's lunch.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to the love of my life! I've loved you for more than 50 years, and I'm just getting started,\" she captioned a series of photos of the couple.\n\n\"Happy anniversary, babe. Marrying someone smart, funny, and adorable is always a good idea,\" Garten captioned a series of photos of the pair in an Instagram post.",

    "fullText": "The investing playbook to follow in the new year homes in on three key sectors of the stock market, according to Citigroup.\n\nThe bank's investment research arm unveiled its list of sector calls heading into the first quarter of 2026, which included three areas it believes investors should be overweight in as the new year begins: Information technology, financials, and healthcare.\n\nBesides financials, those sectors have seen a stellar performance in 2025. The healthcare sector of the S&P 500 is up 17% for the year, while technology stocks are up 28% year-to-date, beating the benchmark index. The financials sector has lagged the broader market, up 6% since January.\n\n\"For most of '25, we led with a Growth cluster focus while frequently advocating a Cyclical barbell,\" the bank wrote of its portfolio based on its 2025 sector picks, which outperformed the S&P 500 by over four percentage points. \"Headed into '26, we focus on a better balance with Defensives. This is aligned with our expectations for fundamental broadening,\" it said of its outlook for the coming year.\n\nHere are Citi's areas of focus heading into the new year, followed by its top stock picks for each sector.\n\nThesis: Earnings growth among banks and financial services stocks appears to be holding strong heading into 2026.\n\nFor bank stocks in particular, profit margins look \"healthy,\" and the sector is flashing positive trading signals, Citi said. The bank pointed to the sector's positive Relative Strength Index reading, one gauge that measures whether an investment is overbought or oversold.\n\nThesis: The bank said it expects \"lessening policy overhang\" to boost investor sentiment across healthcare, referring to trends like uncertainty around drug pricing fading as more pharma companies make deals with the Trump administration.\n\n\"Revisions have turned positive and the growth outlook for '26 should begin to improve,\" the bank said of the healthcare equipment & services area in particular. \"Insiders have stepped up purchases while sells have declined off recent peak.\"\n\nThesis: Fundamentals across the information technology sector look strong, Citi researchers said, pointing to an \"attractive\" growth setup in the semiconductors space and positive earnings revisions in the software & services area.\n\n\"This is our preferred growth sector given good fundamental trends and revisions. Surprisingly, not all valuation reads are stretched,\" the bank wrote.",

    "description": "Trump's Department of Education completed its update to income-based repayment plans, expanding access to borrowers with higher incomes.",
    "fullText": "An affordable student-loan repayment plan is now available to more borrowers.\n\nOn December 22, President Donald Trump's Department of Education said that it had completed a key update to income-based repayment plans, removing the requirement to be in partial financial hardship to enroll.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation included a provision to remove the financial hardship requirement, which meant that the borrower's monthly payment had to be less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over a 10-year period.\n\nNow that the update is complete, borrowers with higher incomes should soon become eligible to enroll in IBR plans. The department said that it encourages borrowers who were previously denied from IBR plans due to a lack of partial financial hardship to reapply using the online income-driven repayment application.\n\n\"If you applied for IBR and your servicer is holding your application, your servicer will process your application in the order in which it was received,\" the department said.\n\nIBR plans give borrowers monthly payments based on their incomes, with student-loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on when they first took out the loan. Specifically, borrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2014, will receive IBR payments based on 15% of their income with a 25-year repayment period. Borrowers who took out loans after that date will receive payments based on 10% of their income with a 20-year repayment period.\n\nAfter a backlog of IBR application processing, the Department of Education restarted student-loan forgiveness in the fall for borrowers who had reached their payment thresholds.\n\nIn addition to the IBR changes, the department is also working to implement other repayment changes, including new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, as well as a new Repayment Assistance Plan intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans. Those changes are set to roll out in July 2026.",

    "description": "For the hefty price of $1 million, plus at least $15,000 in fees, you can get permanent residency in the United States.",
    "fullText": "For the hefty price of $1 million — plus at least $15,000 in fees — you could potentially get permanent residency in the United States.\n\nThat's the promise of President Donald Trump's \"Gold Card\" visa program, which formally launched in early December.\n\nThe program is designed to attract wealthy foreigners to the US. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at an event on Friday that the program had already raised $1.3 billion since launching.\n\nYet it also comes at a time when the Trump administration is otherwise cracking down on other legal forms of immigration.\n\nTrump signed an executive order establishing the Gold Card program in September. Here's what to know about the program.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration's official website for the Gold Card, individuals can receive US residency in \"record time\" if they:\n\nProspective Gold Card holders can also include their spouses and children on their application, but for a price — specifically, an additional $1 million plus $15,000 in DHS fees per person.\n\nThere's also a \"Corporate Gold Card\" program, which allows a corporation to give one of its employees US residency for a $2 million gift.\n\nThat program also allows the Gold Card to be transferred to another employee, for a fee.\n\nAccording to the website, approved cardholders receive EB-1 or EB-2 visas.\n\nThe EB-1 visa — known colloquially as the \"Einstein visa\" — was originally intended for foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities, outstanding professors and researchers, and multinational managers and executives.\n\nThe EB-2 visa is for foreign nationals with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities.\n\nEven as Trump rolls out the red carpet for foreigners who can pay $1 million, his administration has sought to crack down on other visas.\n\nThe most notable example is the H-1B visa, which is for high-skilled foreign workers, many of whom work in the tech sector.\n\nThe administration moved to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas in September, which initially caused chaos at major tech companies amid confusion over whether that fee would apply to current employees who leave the country.\n\nEven more chaos came as the administration rolled out social media screening requirements for visa holders, prompting some companies to warn their employees against travel.\n\nLast week, the administration also said it would pause the DV1 diversity visa lottery program.\n\nThe US wouldn't be the first country to establish a residence-by-investment program.\n\nIn fact, there are several countries that offer foreigners residency in exchange for payment or investment.\n\nThey include countries like Thailand, Panama, Latvia, Portugal, Italy, and Greece.\n\nThe Gold Card website also teases a \"Platinum Card,\" which they say is \"Coming Soon.\" The September executive order does not mention a Platinum Card.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, foreign nationals will be able to pay $5 million and the $15,000 DHS fees in exchange for a visa allowing them to stay in the US for 270 days without being subject to US taxes on non-US income.\n\nThat $5 million sum mirrors the $5 million originally floated by Trump officials for the Gold Card, which has since been lowered to $1 million.\n\nThe website includes a waitlist, along with a note that there's \"no assurance that the Platinum Card contribution will remain at $5 million.\"",

    "description": "Finance pros tell Business Insider about the most annoying investing questions they have to field from family around holidays.",
    "fullText": "For finance professionals, the holidays bring festive cheer and optimism for the new year that we all enjoy. For them, it also brings requests for investing advice and stock picks that sources tell Business Insider they'd rather not have to deal with.\n\nFor many investors, advisors, and others who navigate markets for a living, seeing their relatives during the holiday season often means being asked the same question: What stocks should I buy?\n\nThere's no easy answer, as the stock market is unpredictable and everyone has different risk tolerance, investment horizons, and goals.\n\nColin Sahagun, the founder and CEO of Stelrix, a fintech startup that recently launched an investment-backed spending card, says the question often amounts to, \"How do I get rich quick?\"\n\n\"Every year, someone asks, 'Tell me the next 20 high-growth stocks I should buy,'\" he recalls. \"I will have older relatives asking for 'the next Oklo under 10 dollars' or 'the next Vertiv at fourteen.' They want moonshot ideas and total reassurance at the same time.\"\n\nOklo and Vertiv are two stocks that have enjoyed big runs in 2025. Vertiv has jumped 44%, while Oklo is up a whopping 280%.\n\nSteven Rick, chief economist at financial services firm TruStage, says he's routinely asked for the next hot stock when visiting family for the holidays.\n\nHe notes that a common question is something like: \"Why didn't you tell me to buy Nvidia stock two years ago?\"\n\n\"This is annoying because 'hindsight bias' occurs when family members perceive a past massive rise in a stock price as more predictable than it actually was.\"\n\nAnthony Rasotto, CEO of wealth management firm ARC Wealth, echoed that sentiment, adding that requests for advice on the direction of the market are among the most irritating.\n\n\"The most annoying question is, 'Which way is the market going in the next few months?' It's usually from an uncle near or at retirement,\" he said. \"I always answer: 'I don't know.' If I could predict the market, I wouldn't need to work at all.\"\n\nPeople who work in crytpo also get bombared for advice at the holidays. Adrian Fritz, CIO of digital asset brokerage platform 21Shares, told Business Insider that while he's often asked about the best time to buy bitcoin, he's sometimes asked to name the best asset to buy in the coming year.\n\n\"It assumes there's a single 'best' asset for everyone, as if I've been hiding a secret Christmas stock pick all year waiting to unveil it at dinner,\" he said. \"The reality is a lot less cinematic: good investing depends on personal circumstances, not holiday fortune-telling.\"\n\nFinance pros stress that there is never a clear answer to the annoying stock market questions they receive from relatives. Anthony Termini, a former hedge fund CIO turned investment analyst and commentator, highlighted why many people don't want to discuss these topics in depth.\n\n\"The answer is always, 'who knows?'\" he said. \"More importantly, who cares? Whatever the answer is, it may never be an asset class or security that is appropriate or suitable.\"",

    "description": "TikTok and ByteDance are upping performance bonuses and other incentives for strong performers as they look to retain talent in 2026.",
    "fullText": "TikTok is increasing how much it spends on high-performing staffers in 2026, according to a memo from owner ByteDance sent last week and viewed by Business Insider.\n\nIn ByteDance's upcoming annual performance reviews, the company aims to spend 50% more globally on incentives like bonuses or raises that increase the total take-home pay for some staff compared to the previous cycle, the memo said. The payouts are reserved for top talent at the company as part of a push to keep them happy and also attract new hires, per the memo.\n\nThe compensation adjustments will be applied across most departments, but not all employees will benefit, as the extra spending is for workers who exceed certain scores in reviews, the memo said.\n\nByteDance informed its staff that the pay increases were designed to meet a moment when the tech industry is facing a slew of new challenges and opportunities, making it crucial to attract and retain talent.\n\nPay offers for high-demand tech workers in hot areas like AI have reached astronomical heights this year as companies like Meta have gone on hiring sprees that included nine-figure signing bonuses. Amazon tweaked its pay bands earlier this year to reward its \"Top Tier\" workers, and other tech companies, including Meta and Google, have made adjustments to better separate high and low performers.\n\nPerformance reviews are a big focus at TikTok, and the company pushes managers to avoid grading staff at the mid-point, even if their instinct is \"to avoid conflict,\" Business Insider previously reported. Last year, TikTok adjusted its performance review process to give out more low scores as part of a push to differentiate high performers from weak ones.\n\nAs part of ByteDance's incentive adjustments for 2026, the company said in the memo that it would invest 35% \n\nA larger portion of bonuses will arrive in the form of cash rather than stock options next year, the memo said. That shift may appeal to staffers who are unsure of the potential liquidity of their equity after the company announced plans to spin off part of TikTok's US business into a joint venture next year, one current staffer said.\n\nFor employees who get equity as part of their compensation, the company said in its memo that it's shortening the vesting period from four years to three.\n\nAlongside the payment changes, ByteDance said in the memo that it plans to shift how it structures jobs at the company into 10 different levels. It also said it would have higher standards of performance.\n\nThe new incentive policies arrive at a moment of flux for TikTok and ByteDance. TikTok's US employees learned on Thursday that part of their company is being spun off in a joint venture that includes new investors like Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX.\n\nAs part of the deal, which TikTok expects to close in January, certain key aspects of the business, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will continue to be managed by ByteDance, according to a memo from TikTok CEO Shou Chew viewed by Business Insider.\n\nOffering current US staffers the opportunity to receive bigger bonuses next year may help the company retain talent as it goes through a period of transition.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "We don't know why Bari Weiss pulled a '60 Minutes' story — here's why that matters",
    "description": "The new head of CBS News has been immersed in politics since she started. So of course her call to hold a story will be viewed from a political lens.",
    "fullText": "Ever since Bari Weiss arrived as the head of CBS News, people inside and outside the company have been waiting to see whether her politics — and those of CBS owner David Ellison — would show up in the journalism.\n\nThis weekend, they may have gotten their answer. Or they may not have.\n\nAnd that uncertainty is the problem.\n\nIt's possible Weiss had legitimate editorial concerns about a \"60 Minutes\" segment on the Trump administration's use of El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. CBS pulled the segment abruptly before it was scheduled to air on Sunday evening. News organizations do periodically delay or spike stories.\n\nBut the reported details around this decision make it hard to take the explanation entirely at face value. And Weiss's position — and the politics surrounding her appointment — mean that editorial calls like this one will always be read for hints of political bias.\n\nThe segment, reported by Sharyn Alfonsi, had been promoted by CBS ahead of Sunday's broadcast and, according to multiple accounts, had cleared the network's standard internal processes. A few hours before airtime, CBS News announced that the segment needed additional reporting and editorial work.\n\n\"In my view, pulling it now — after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,\" she wrote in a note to her co-workers. \"We are trading 50 years of 'Gold Standard' reputation for a single week of political quiet.\"\n\nWeiss, meanwhile, told her staff Monday morning that she held the story because \"it did not advance the ball,\" and because it didn't include on-camera comment from the Trump administration, which had sent hundreds of Venezuelans to the prison, where many were reportedly tortured. She had previously sent a memo to \"60 Minutes\" producers complaining that the report they'd made didn't provide viewers with \"the full context they need to assess the story.\"\n\nThere are two big problems with those arguments: 1) Making them so late in the process of a long-running investigation, shortly before the air date, is guaranteed to raise eyebrows. And 2) arguing that a story about the Trump administration can't air without on-camera participation from the Trump administration leads to a chilling endpoint: If the Trump administration doesn't want a story to run on \"60 Minutes,\" it can kill it by not showing up on camera.\n\nNow, add in the environment Weiss stepped into. She arrived at CBS News through a deal engineered by Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, at a moment when the Ellison family is deeply enmeshed with the Trump administration.\n\nDavid Ellison's father, Larry, who funded his son's acquisition of Paramount, controls Oracle — which just got approval to acquire part of the US operations of TikTok, in a deal the Trump administration negotiated with the Chinese government. And the Ellisons are also trying to get Trump to favor their bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery — a deal that would require approval from the Trump-controlled Department of Justice, as well as other regulators.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has already been complaining about \"60 Minutes\" under Ellison's ownership. \"For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,\" he posted on his Truth Social platform last week.\n\nNone of which proves that politics drove Weiss' decision. And it's understandable if the way \"60 Minutes\" used to work isn't the way Weiss wants it to work — she's the new boss, and she has spent much of her career complaining about big media institutions like \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nBut it explains why people are wondering if Weiss' call was directly, or indirectly, influenced by her owner and his political status. I've asked Weiss for comment; a Paramount rep declined to comment.\n\nWhat we do know is this: The decision was made inside a system where the people who own the newsroom need things from a president who wants leverage over the press.\n\nIn that world, suspicion isn't paranoia. It's a rational response to how power works. And it's not something Weiss can fix, explain away, or out-communicate.",

    "description": "Extending an H-1B visa used to mean a quick trip abroad. Now it can mean getting stranded, as consular officers review applicants' social-media posts.",
    "fullText": "Reupping an H-1B visa used to mean a quick trip abroad. Now it can mean getting stranded.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies are advising some employees with visas not to travel outside the US because of a new Trump administration policy mandating that consular officers review visa applicants' social-media posts before issuing visas.\n\nThe extra screening is dragging out processing, and some embassies and consulates are canceling or pushing back visa appointments — in some cases by many months — as the backlog grows.\n\nAn H-1B visa is basically a travel document — the stamp in a worker's passport that lets them show up at an American airport or border and ask to enter. It's typically valid for up to three years. But it doesn't guarantee admission, explained Jason Finkelman, a Texas lawyer focused on family- and work-based immigration.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection officer makes the final call on whether the worker is allowed in and under what immigration status. The officer issues an I-94 record with an \"admit until\" date, which sets how long the person is allowed to stay.\n\nBecause these are separate processes, they don't always expire at the same time. Someone might have a visa stamp that expires in late 2026 but still have valid status through 2028.\n\nThat means a visa holder can continue to live and work legally in the US even after the visa stamp in their passport has expired, as long as their \"admit until\" date hasn't passed.\n\nHow do H-1B holders get their stamps renewed?\n\nIf a visa holder needs a new stamp, they generally have to apply at a US consulate or embassy, typically in their home country. The visa holder books an interview, where a consular officer reviews their documents and asks questions about their job or background.\n\nIf all goes smoothly, they get their passport back with a new stamp. The turnaround can range from a few days to weeks, lawyers say, depending on where the application is processed and whether it's flagged for extra review.\n\nSome people who traveled abroad to renew their visa stamps have had their appointments delayed or rescheduled, sometimes with little warning. Until they have that stamp in hand, they can't board a return flight or show up at the border and expect to be admitted.\n\nThe new social-media screenings are a big part of what's gumming up the process. Starting December 15, the State Department expanded its \"online presence\" reviews to all H-1B applicants and their H-4 family members, and instructed applicants to set their social media profiles to public so consular officers can review their activity.\n\nJustin Parsons, a partner at the global immigration law firm BAL, said around 40 or 50 of his clients are unable to return to the US while they wait for visa stamps. He said his clients are experiencing longer delays in Hyderabad and Chennai, India.\n\nA State Department spokesperson told Business Insider on Thursday that the purpose of the reviews is to use \"all available tools\" to flag applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests or intend to engage in activities inconsistent with the terms of their visas.\n\nWhat does the new social-media screening involve?\n\nWhat this new screening looks like in practice is still coming into focus. The State Department hasn't spelled out exactly how consular officers are weighing social media posts, or how long the added reviews might take.\n\nWhat advice are immigration attorneys giving to visa applicants?\n\nVisa applicants should carefully review their profiles to make sure basic details, like job titles, employers, locations, and timelines, line up with what's in their visa paperwork, according to lawyers at Duane Morris and Fisher Phillips. Even small discrepancies, they warn, can trigger questions or additional review.\n\nSome firms also caution against scrambling to clean up accounts or deleting posts at the last minute. If an immigration official notices, it could be seen as evasive.\n\nFor now, lawyers are urging caution. In some cases, lawyers say, the safest move right now may be not traveling at all.\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mrussell@businessinsider.com or Signal at @MeliaRussell.01.

    "description": "PERM applications at Google will ramp up in 2026, affecting visa holders seeking green cards and permanent residency.",
    "fullText": "Google told employees it will be \"ramping up\" PERM applications in 2026 for eligible employees, a crucial step to securing a green card.\n\nThe company told staff in a December newsletter that employees eligible for PERM would hear from its outside lawyers in Q1, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nPERM allows employees to move from working on a visa to securing a green card. Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\n\nTech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to \"significant\" delays, Business Insider reported.\n\nAccording to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience.\n\nThe memo also said that staff must work from a Google office to be considered.\n\n\"Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible,\" the memo read.\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role.\n\nGoogle paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms.\n\nThe sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers.\n\nGoogle applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said.\n\nGoogle told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said.\n\nIt also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are \"not in good standing\" with the company.\n\n\"Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM,\" it read. MI means \"moderate impact\" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews.\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "ChatGPT doesn't want to be left out of the \"Wrapped\" party that Spotify popularized. So say hello to \"Your Year with ChatGPT.\"\n\nOpenAI launched the new retrospective on its app on Monday, informing users about the top themes of their chats, the number of messages they have sent, and the awards they have earned.\n\nIt'll even generate some pixel art that depicts some of the your themes.\n\nThe recap is available in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. To see it, click the plus button in the app and ask, \"Show me my year with ChatGPT.\"\n\nIt's available to Free, Pro, and Plus users, but not those with a business or enterprise account. (So for those with ChatGPT accounts through your work, you likely won't be able to brag to your boss about your ChatGPT stats.)\n\nYour Year with ChatGPT!\n\nNow rolling out to everyone in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia who have reference saved memory and reference chat history turned on.\n\nJust make sure your app is updated. pic.twitter.com/whVkS1qxKu\n\nOpenAI joins the many companies that are rolling out user rundowns for 2025. Alongside the common streamer packages from Spotify and Apple Music, there are recaps this year from LinkedIn, Uber, Dunkin', Snapchat, Strava, Partiful, and more.\n\nAll these apps promise to show you what you've been up to for the past year — perhaps lightly roasting you in the process.\n\nChatGPT's rundown begins with a piece of poetry, followed by the three most prominent themes, based on the user's chat history. Then it gets into the statistics.\n\nUsers can learn how many messages they sent, their total number of chats, and their chattiest day. They can also see how many em-dashes have been exchanged throughout the chats, a figure ChatGPT often uses.\n\nNext, the user can learn about their chat style. This is a measure of tone: ChatGPT told me that I spoke \"casually, wryly, and directly.\"\n\nThen come the awards and accolades. ChatGPT awarded me the \"Most Likely to Google, 'Is this Flight Worth It?'\" It's a bit ironic — I wouldn't Google that, I'd ask ChatGPT.\n\nMy archetype was determined to be the tinkerer, a title given to 8.5% of users. The title meant I learned by trying, and that I used ChatGPT to experiment.\n\nOpenAI has improved its image and video creation models, recently rolling out Sora 2. The recap features an AI-generated piece of pixel art inspired by the year. I asked mine about moving to Brooklyn; it included a matcha.\n\nOther features are more interactive. Want to learn what your 2026 has in store? You'll have to wipe away the \"mists of mystery\" (which looks more like heaps of snow) to learn your fate. Reload the page, and you'll see another fortune.\n\nWith that, ChatGPT's recap comes to a close, but not before sharing an inspiring message.\n\n\"Across all the drafts, questions, and rabbit holes, you found a place to work things out,\" it said. \"And that's no small thing.\"",

    "fullText": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia will use drones to resume spraying of coca crops with a weed killer, the government announced on Monday as authorities grapple with record levels of cocaine production that have fueled tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nThe South American country banned aerial fumigation of coca crops in 2015, after the World Health Organization put glyphosate — the weed killer used by spray planes — on a list of carcinogens.\n\nJustice Minister Andrés Idárraga told a news conference that the new action involving high-tech drones was approved by the government and would begin on Thursday.\n\nHe said the drones would be sent to areas where gangs and rebel groups are forcing peasants to grow coca, the primary source of cocaine. “Our security forces will be safer” that way, Idárraga added.\n\nEnvironmental activists had long warned that small airplanes spraying coca fields — often flown by U.S. contractors — were also dumping their chemicals on legal crops and into streams, polluting vulnerable ecosystems and exposing villagers to contaminated water.\n\nAfter suspending aerial fumigation, Colombia stepped up manual eradication campaigns, carried out by soldiers.\n\nBut the cultivation of coca expanded without aerial spraying as it became harder for the military to eradicate coca crops in remote areas, where plantations are defended by drug gangs and rebel groups, and are sometimes surrounded by land mines.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2024, as much as 261,000 hectares (about 645,000 acres) in Colombia were planted with coca, almost double what was planted in 2016.\n\nAccording to Idárraga, the drones will fly no further than 1.5 meters (5 feet) from their targets to ensure that water sources and legal crops are not sprayed. A single drone will be able to eradicate about a hectare of coca crops every 30 minutes.\n\n“This is a controlled and efficient” way, Idárraga said, adding that \"it mitigates environmental risks.”\n\nThe idea of using drones to eradicate coca fields was first floated in 2018 by right-wing President Ivan Duque's administration. But plans were delayed due to the lack of a consensus in government agencies and in Colombia's parliament\n\nColombia’s current government, led by left-wing President Gustavo Petro, initially dismissed aerial fumigation and other forced eradication campaigns, saying it didn't want to target impoverished peasants growing coca for drug dealers because they lacked legal alternatives.\n\nPetro's administration became more aggressive on the issue of coca crops this year as it tries to defeat rebel groups funded by the illegal drug trade that have refused to sign peace agreements with the government and that have recently stepped up attacks in Colombian cities.\n\nThe United States has long criticized Colombia’s decision to halt the aerial fumigations. The Trump administration, which has accused Petro’s government of not doing enough to halt cocaine production, added Colombia in September to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, jeopardizing millions of dollars in military and economic cooperation.\n\nIn October, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing “drug cartels to flourish” in the country. More recently, Washington threatened to authorize land strikes against drug traffickers in Colombia.\n\nPetro has vehemently denied the U.S. accusations of not doing enough to target drug traffickers and says Colombian security forces are intercepting record numbers of cocaine shipments, even if the nation is also producing record amounts of the drug.",

Ted Cruz of Texas, is seriously eyeing a run for the presidency.\n\nDuring a meeting in Washington, D.C., in November, Cruz, who has given a number of speeches decrying antisemitism in the GOP, told Klein he had been fielding requests from people urging him to seek the White House in 2028.\n\nCruz, Klein said, came across as someone “seriously” considering such a run.\n\nTwo additional sources confirmed that Cruz is weighing what would be his second presidential bid.\n\nCruz failed to gain the GOP nod in 2016, when Donald Trump won the Republican Party nomination and the White House.\n\nThe Washington Post said that Cruz in recent months has positioned himself as a voice for a more traditional, interventionist GOP foreign policy.\n\nThe senator has also called on the GOP to separate itself from former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, whom Cruz has said is injecting the “poison” of antisemitism into the Republican Party.\n\nCruz has also criticized Vance, a close ally of Carlson, to Republican donors, two people familiar with the senator’s comments told the Pose.\n\nCruz has also said that Vance’s foreign policy views are dangerously isolationist.\n\nVance is widely expected to seek the GOP nomination for president in 2028. President Trump has said that a ticket of Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be potent.\n\nVance widely leads polling on the race for the GOP nod for the White House. The veep is also the favorite of gamblers placing bets on the 2028 race on legal wagering sites.\n\n“Can Ted help craft or meld together the traditional Republican approach with the new reality of what the Republican Party is now?” said Daron Shaw, a political science professor at the University of Texas who overlapped with Cruz as a staffer on George W. Bush’s presidential campaign. “It’s a heavy lift.”",

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, December 22, 2025: Stability makes rates easy to shop for",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. Rates have barely moved since the end of October. To get a low rate, you'll want to shop multiple lenders for your best offer.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nWith so little volatility, mortgage rates remain easy to shop for right now. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.03%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.42%. The 30-year interest rate has has been content to remain mostly unchanged since the end of October.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.03%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.03% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,804, and you’d pay $349,599 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.42% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,439. But you’d only pay $138,936 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.03%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.42%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.03%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.03%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its November forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.\n\n“Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S. officials who are trying to steer the neighboring countries toward compromises.\n\n“There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has for months been pushing for a peace agreement, but the negotiations have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives, though Trump was less effusive the following day, saying, “The talks are going along.”\n\n“We are talking. It's going OK,\" Trump said Monday while on vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Asked if he planned to speak to Zelenskyy or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't say, offering only of the fighting, “I'd like to see it stopped.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said “nearly 90%” of Ukraine’s demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.\n\nThe backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.\n\nZelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a “backstop” from Washington, ensuring “Ukraine’s security in the air, on land, and at sea.”\n\n“Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on,” the Ukrainian president said.\n\nUkraine is arguing that the bilateral document with the U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.\n\nUkraine strikes deep inside Russia\n\nZelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.\n\n“In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly,” he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nUkrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.\n\nThe attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia’s bigger army.\n\nThe strikes also seek to undermine Putin’s attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.\n\nThe killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.\n\nUkrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets\n\nUkrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement Monday.\n\nA pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.\n\nIt added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nA separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.\n\nUkrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.\n\nRussia targets the power grid again\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine’s energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nEnergy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "title": "A Cordless Blower Is the Overlooked Tool You Definitely Need",
    "description": "It might look like an overhyped fan, but you can accomplish a lot with one of these.",
    "fullText": "Once you start down the path of DIY, you'll soon realize that any time you find yourself wishing someone had created a tool to serve a specific purpose, someone probably has—no matter how narrow the use case. Case in point: The cordless blower/inflator.\n\nThis tool is exactly what it sounds like. Shaped like a power drill, it simply...blows air (though sort of like a handheld leaf blower, these tools typically come with an array of nozzles to give you a bit of precision with the flow of your forced air). You might think this sounds like a tool you’ll never actually need, because you have lungs. But I'm here to convince you that you're wrong: A cordless blower will absolutely be one of the most useful tools you ever acquire.\n\nHandheld blowers have a lot of uses that make every DIY job you do a little bit easier and faster:\n\nCleaning. Probably the most common use case for a blower is to quickly clean a work area by blowing away dust, sawdust, clippings, shavings, and other small debris. You can use a blower to quickly clear off a workbench, blow dust out of keyboards, engines, or anywhere else. This is also really useful if you have a tight spot where you can’t fit a tool—the blower can clean it out in a jiffy. It’s also useful for a quick cleanup on outdoor furniture or even my deck—while you might want an actual leaf blower for full-scale yard cleanup, a handheld blower can do an adequate, quickie cleanup on demand.\n\nShortening drying times. If you’re waiting on something to dry out before you can move on to the next stage of your project, a blower can speed up that drying time considerably.\n\nCooling other tools down. There’s nothing more irritating than an overheating tool that forces you to stop and wait for it to return to a safe operating temperature. A blower can speed up that process, acting as a high-powered fan with a very precise, narrow blast of air to cool down hot components.\n\nRedirecting dust and debris. When working inside, you often want to use a vacuum to collect dust as you work, but outside, a small, handheld blower can be more convenient. Using it to redirect dust and debris away from you as you work can keep grit out of your eyes and your workspace clean as you go.\n\nInflating stuff. These blowers come with attachments that not only allow you to be as narrow or wide with your airstream as needed, but also fit into standard nozzles. Need to inflate an air mattress, pool ball, or anything else? The blower will make short work of it.\n\nOnce I started using a blower while I worked, I found myself reaching for it constantly just to keep my workspace clear of dust, and then I started grabbing it literally any time a blast of air seemed helpful. You might not think you need a blower in your tool chest, but you probably do.\n\nMost cordless blowers are similar in terms of shape and function. The two from major brands you’ll come across most are Milwaukee’s M18 18V Brushless Cordless Precision Blower and Makita’s 18V LXT Brushless Cordless High Speed Blower/Inflator. They’re both solid tools, but I prefer the Makita because, in my experience, its battery life is much better (the Milwaukee has a bit more power, but I’ve never had a scenario where I needed more power). The Makita tends to last 45 minutes to an hour on a single charge, but when I borrowed a Milwaukee it died about a half hour into the job. Obviously, this will depend on a lot of variables, including what you’re using it for, but the Makita wins for me because every time I grabbed it there was enough charge left to finish the job.",

    "title": "How Useful Are Ankle Weights, Really?",
    "description": "They're cheap and popular, but ankle weights have serious limitations.",
    "fullText": "Ankle weights seem to have tunneled through a wormhole from the 1980s to the present moment, appearing in countless TikToks and Instagram posts. Do they really help tone your legs? Are they worth buying at all? The promises are overrated, but in some cases ankle weights do actually work. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nAnkle weights’ best use is to add a little bit of resistance to exercises where you are moving your legs against gravity. For example, side-lying leg raises become substantially more work for your muscles with even a pound or two of weight on the ankle that you’re raising in the air. Donkey kicks and hollow body holds would fall into this category as well. Weights like these, with 2.5 pounds per ankle, may be a good option if you're new to strength training or new to these particular exercises.\n\nThe ankle weights aren’t necessarily making your ankles or legs work harder, in these examples; they just add resistance to what is still an exercise for your hips, butt, or abs. And the main source of weight is actually your leg itself. If leg raises are challenging, leg raises plus an ankle weight will be more challenging.\n\nThese uses of ankle weights make sense, because they’re a way to add resistance over time. To continue progressing, you’ll need to use heavier weights when your current ones become too easy. Eventually, you may get to a point where an ankle weight exercise is no longer challenging and you’ll need to work those same muscles in a different way.\n\nAnkle weights work best for exercises where you're using muscles toward the center of your body (like abs or hips) to move your legs. In these exercises, your legs provide most of the weight; the ankle weight is just adding to the difficulty. Ankle weights being light, you need to put them at the end of a long lever. In a leg raise, your legs are basically a very long third-class lever. Or to put it another way: the farther away a small weight is from your body, the heavier it feels.\n\nIf you’re running, jumping, or walking, ankle weights can make the motion a little bit harder, but they’re probably not a good addition. Think about why you’re doing these exercises in the first place. If your goal with running or walking is to burn calories, you can do that more efficiently by running faster or farther, no ankle weights necessary.\n\nSome trainers even warn that wearing ankle weights while running or walking may set you up for muscle imbalances or for injury; though it’s not clear if that’s really the case or not. I couldn’t find any solid evidence about injury either way, but historian Conor Heffernan pointed me to a 1988 paper that concluded ankle weights don’t provide any significant extra calorie burn, and aren’t worth the potential risk. That may be the source of the warning, which I recall hearing way back in the olden days of the 1990s.\n\nAny time you’re looking at a small weight—whether it’s a pair of ankle weights, or a tiny dumbbell, or anything else—think of it in terms of progressive overload.\n\nProgressive overload is one of the basic principles of strength training. To keep getting results, you have to use heavier and heavier weights over time. That’s how somebody who starts deadlifting with just the bar can end up strong enough to lift hundreds of pounds. Small weights can help you get started on that journey, but they won’t sustain it.\n\nAnkle weights are often just one or two pounds each, although I have a set like this one that can be loaded with about ten pounds if you put all the little sandbag inserts into just one cuff of the pair. It was handy when I was rehabbing an injury; my physical therapist recommended side-lying leg raises. At first I was doing them without added weight, but I ended up needing most of the weights in the set by the time my rehab was through.\n\nLooking through ads and Instagram posts for this article, it became clear why ankle weights are popular all of a sudden. You can advertise them by putting them on a model with great legs in a snazzy pair of leggings, and having her work out by a beach or in front of a vibrantly colored wall. They just look cool, especially some of the newer styles that look like blocky bangles.\n\nAlso, being fairly lightweight, they’re cheaper to manufacture and ship than, say, a kettlebell. So while they may have a place in your workout routine, it would be a mistake to think you’re buying a versatile or long-lived piece of equipment by treating yourself to a pair of ankle weights.",

    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to cut off funding to the pro‑immigration group FWD.us marks a sharp turn away from the high-profile social advocacy that once defined his philanthropy, even as MacKenzie Scott is emerging as the era’s most aggressive backer of equity- and DEI-driven causes.\n\nThe split shows a broader divergence in tech philanthropy: one billionaire channeling resources into science and AI infrastructure, the other pouring unrestricted billions into institutions serving communities historically excluded from power and wealth.\n\nFor more than a decade, FWD.us was a marquee example of Zuckerberg’s attempt to fuse Silicon Valley muscle with Washington policy, pushing immigration and criminal justice reform from the political center.\n\nBut in 2025, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) quietly stopped funding FWD.us—its first year without support from Zuckerberg; his wife, Priscilla Chan; or their philanthropy—formally ending a relationship that began with a 2013 launch op‑ed and hundreds of millions of dollars in backing, Business Insider reports.\n\nThe wind‑down was years in the making: By late 2022, CZI had already begun pivoting away from social advocacy, providing “foundational” funding meant to give FWD.us runway before the partnership ended, and in April 2025, the break was formalized. The timing now reads less like a slow fade than a strategic alignment with Zuckerberg’s rightward political recalibration in the Trump era, as Meta relaxed content rules criticized by conservatives, while the company and its CEO leaned into the new administration.\n\nCZI’s new pitch sounds less like a traditional foundation and more like a research lab: Its leadership talks about GPUs, not gala dinners. In November, Zuckerberg and Chan announced that CZI would concentrate on science and AI, doubling down on the Biohub network of biology labs it has funded since 2016 and recruiting researchers with the promise of massive compute power rather than more office space.\n\nWhere early CZI grants were scattered across immigration, criminal justice, and education policy, the current strategy funnels capital into building infrastructure—data, tools, and models—that scientists can use for decades. The bet is that by underwriting AI‑enabled biomedical discovery and related fields, CZI can claim long‑horizon, system‑level impact without the political volatility that accompanies hot‑button social debates like border policy or policing.\n\nMacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is moving in the opposite direction, embracing the very equity agendas many corporations and campuses are backing away from under political pressure. In 2025 alone, she announced roughly $7.1 billion in donations—bringing her total giving since 2019 to more than $26 billion—with a heavy tilt toward historically Black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, Native scholarship providers, and organizations serving low‑income and underrepresented students.",

    "fullText": "LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivian miners marched in downtown La Paz, the country's capital, and union-organized protesters took to the streets elsewhere on Monday, the first day of a strike over the government's scrapping of fuel subsidies that have been blamed for contributing to dollar shortages and economic turmoil.\n\nThe protests were called for by Bolivia’s Central Union of Workers but many trade groups, including transportation workers, did not join the rallies. Some union leaders said they would go along with the elimination of the subsidies, which had been in place for almost two decades.\n\nBolivia's centrist President Rodrigo Paz, who took office on Nov. 8, ended the fuel subsidy that previous left-wing governments had maintained for more than 20 years, keeping gas prices at $0.53 per liter. An emergency decree by Paz last week put the price of gasoline at around $1 per liter.\n\n“The country is sick and must be healed,” Paz said on Sunday in a town hall meeting that was broadcast on state television.\n\n“Every day, $10 million is spent on a subsidy that benefits smugglers” who resell the subsidized fuel in Bolivia and abroad, Paz added.\n\nBusiness groups in Bolivia have backed Paz’s new economic measures, which are expected to ease dollar shortages and make it easier for companies to import goods and capital.\n\n“We knew that at some point the subsidies would end” said Luis Paco, a union leader representing merchants in the city of El Alto. “There were no negotiations over the new adjustments, but we knew this was inevitable.”\n\nBus drivers unions stayed away from Monday’s protests after Bolivia’s government said they will be able to import auto parts duty-free. Paz has also mandated a 20% increase in the minimum wage.\n\nImports of gasoline and diesel — costing the government up to $3 billion a year — had depleted foreign currency reserves and worsened Bolivia's biggest economic crisis in four decades, following the decline of the nation’s natural gas exports.\n\nBut unions that have traditionally aligned with left-wing political leaders — including those representing miners and coca growers — went on strike on Monday, demanding that fuel subsidies be reinstated.\n\nLa Paz police sealed off access to the central square where the palace housing the government is located, to prevent demonstrators from entering.\n\nIn the neighboring city of El Alto, local councils blocked some avenues. There were also road blocks on highways in six of the country’s nine regions, according to Bolivia’s highway administration agency.\n\n“We are in the streets in a struggle that will continue until that decree eliminating the subsidy is repealed,” mining leader Andrés Paye told reporters. “This government approves regulations to favor business owners and punish the poor.”\n\nUnions aligned with former President Evo Morales, led a massive march in Cochabamba, the Andean country’s third-largest city, and blocked two major highways in the east of the country.\n\nThe bus drivers unions did not join the strike, after negotiating over the weekend with Paz's new government.\n\n“We will continue to work, to serve the people” said Lucio Gomez, a leader of a transport workers union.\n\nCarlos Cordero, a political science professor in La Paz, said the union behind the strike was trying to “show its strength” ahead of next year's elections for governors and mayors. But the relatively low turnout on Monday showed that the union has been weakened, he said.\n\n“In many sectors of the country, there is a conviction that the adjustment was necessary” Cordero said.",

The privately held firm has since expanded HarmonyOS beyond smartphones and tablets.\n\nHuawei Pura 80 smartphones are displayed at the company's flagship store in Beijing, June 11, 2025.

That came roughly a year after it launched HarmonyOS 5 in late 2024.\n\nNotably, the latest version features a new function similar to Apple's AirDrop, which enables direct file transfers between Huawei and Apple devices for the first time.\n\nHarmonyOS accounted for 17 per cent of China's smartphone operating systems in the second quarter of the year, ahead of iOS's 16 per cent, maintaining its lead over Apple for the sixth consecutive quarter, according to data released by Counterpoint Research in September.\n\nHarmonyOS was China's second-largest mobile operating system behind Android, which had a dominant 66 per cent share in the quarter, according to Counterpoint.\n\nThe increasing adoption of HarmonyOS was largely attributed to Huawei's rebound in the domestic smartphone market.\n\nAccording to the latest data from research firm BCI, Huawei reclaimed its spot as China's top smartphone vendor in the last week of November and first week of December, overtaking Apple, following the launch of its flagship Mate 80 series.\n\nThe Mate 80 series, including the basic Mate 80, Mate 80 Pro, Mate 80 Pro Max and Mate 80 RS models, as well as the foldable Mate X7, was released in late November.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Early sampling of flu cases show that 90% of influenza A viruses were positive for the strain. Experts encourage people to get a flu shot.\n\nSymptoms of the flu include fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, headaches, fatigue and occasionally vomiting or diarrhea, according to the CDC. While most people get better in a few days or a couple of weeks, some complications, like pneumonia, can be deadly.\n\nUpdate: This story was updated on Monday, Dec 22 at 2:08 p.m. to reflect that Subclade K is not covered in this year’s flu shot but the A strain is.\n\nPain ointment pulled from shelves after safety concerns arise\n\nSuper-popular Italian restaurant chain making major change\n\nBirmingham tears down another homeless encampment amid questions and outcry\n\nUAB physician and AI innovator may leave US due to parents’ immigration limbo",

    "fullText": "Rugby players who allege they suffered brain injuries during their careers have been refused permission to appeal against a decision ordering them to provide all of their medical records.\n\nMore than 1,100 players – across both league and union - claim they are suffering from conditions such as dementia, Parkinson's and motor neurone disease because of repeated impacts sustained throughout their careers.\n\nThey accuse World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union (RFU), the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), the Rugby Football League (RFL) and others of failing to protect them from risks. The governing bodies deny liability.\n\nIn a previous hearing, Susan Rodway KC for the players said the order to provide medical records was \"impossible, onerous and costly\".\n\nBut a High Court judge has refused the appeal, saying the order is \"not disproportionate, oppressive, irrational or legally perverse\".\n\nRylands Garth, the law firm bringing the case, said it is grateful to the judge for providing clarity and that it would comply with the court's orders.\n\nJudge Dexter Dias said orders issued in February 2024 and 2025 which required the claimants to hand over medical records and all documents from neurological testing were proportionate and necessary to manage the litigation.\n\nWorld Rugby, the RFU and the WRU said in a joint statement that \"player welfare remains a central priority for rugby and we shall not stand still in this space\".\n\nSteve Thompson, Mark Regan and Phil Vickery - part of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning squad - former Wales stars Gavin Henson, Colin Charvis and Ryan Jones and ex-England and British and Lions scrum-half Harry Ellis are among those seeking damages from World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU.\n\nIn November, former British and Irish Lions Lee Byrne and Phil Greening were confirmed to have joined the concussion lawsuit.\n\nIn their joint statement, the governing bodies said: \"The judgement expressed concern that there has been a serious erosion of the court's confidence in the way the disclosure process has been conducted, and noted that effective and fair disclosure of the relevant documents was 'indispensable' in the context of the case.\n\n\"As such many players in the case are at risk of having their claims struck out.\"\n\nRylands Garth is being investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority over former England prop Will Green's claims that the firm attempted to pressurise him into joining the action despite him obtaining a second, independent diagnosis that showed no sign of brain injury.\n\nThe case is scheduled to be reviewed again in March 2026.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): I know a lot of people will say \"it was 3-0 against West Ham\". But he made four or five massive saves in the early part of the second half, which kept them ahead and gave them a fighting chance to win. Manchester City have been good, but not setting the world alight defensively. Donnarumma has to keep providing and turning up with big performances.\n\nReece James (Chelsea): We have had Reece in the team a few times and, ahead of the World Cup, he looks the real deal. We have never questioned his ability, but he falls into the 'if he is fit' category. At the moment he has not had an injury for a year and touch wood that continues. His free-kick in the draw at Newcastle was a pearler.\n\nPiero Hincapie (Arsenal): Slightly going under the radar for Arsenal. They brought him in late, when other people were looking at him, and he has been excellent. A solid performance against Everton.\n\nJoachim Andersen (Fulham): For years he has come with class for Fulham. He hits that lovely raking diagonal pass and his organisational skills also help. He organises and marshalls that defence, and did so again against Forest. He is very astute.\n\nAntonee Robinson (Fulham): It is good to see him back. A big season with a World Cup coming up and he is vital for the United States. He had some tough times with injuries but is starting to show he is getting back to his best.\n\nKeane Lewis-Potter (Brentford): He has previously been deployed at full-back but now we are starting to see him in his more favoured position further up the field. Two wonderful goals in a huge game for Brentford at Wolves and a win that has probably already sealed their survival.\n\nEthan Ampadu (Leeds): I really, really like this player. I like what he is about. Not only has he grown as a player since he left Chelsea but he has grown as a human and a real leader. Big tackles, big moments, he is always there and got a goal in the victory against Palace.\n\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): The man of the moment. Two goals again - both wonderful finishes against Manchester United. Is Rogers the guy to lead England? Do you leave out Bellingham? Foden? Palmer? Just how well he is playing would suggest you would have to have a serious conversation about it. He has seven goals for Villa and is flying.\n\nNick Woltemade (Newcastle): He scored two goals and should probably have got a hat-trick against Chelsea at the weekend. It looks like the return of Yoane Wissa has given him a little spark and put that devil back in him. He is scoring and getting in the right positions. A few weeks ago he went off the boil a bit and maybe he had got a bit comfortable.\n\nErling Haaland (Manchester City): The guvnor, the king. He scored two but probably should have got four if I am being really critical. He is just a machine. His next goal will be his 150th in all competitions for Manchester City in five years. Let that sink in. That is frightening. You could put him in my team every week.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin (Leeds): People are asking if he could make a sneaky run into the England set-up for the summer. I think it would be a big ask considering the amount of injuries he has had over the course of his career. Right now let's just enjoy him being back, fit and playing - and when he is fit and playing he scores goals. That's all that really matters.\n\nDaniel Farke (Leeds United): A brilliant victory against Crystal Palace. Only two weeks ago, people were saying Palace were top-four contenders and were also saying Farke was under real pressure. Now, when you look at it, Leeds are probably favoured to stay up from this position. They have given themselves a fighting chance and this was easily the result of the weekend.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Fulham may have had to wait nearly a year for a Premier League penalty, but its conversion should never have been in doubt.\n\nRaul Jimenez calmly slotted home the Cottagers' first penalty since the 2-2 draw with Ipswich in January 2025 to earn Fulham a 1-0 win against Nottingham Forest and move to within two spot-kicks of breaking a Premier League record.\n\nThe Mexican has now joined Yaya Toure as being the only players, from those who have taken 10 or more, to have converted all of them. Both have now scored 11 from 11.\n\nChelsea's Cole Palmer went ahead of Toure when he scored two penalties against Tottenham in December 2024, giving him 12 from 12, but he then had a penalty saved against Leicester in March to end his 100% strike rate.\n\nJimenez now needs two more successful penalties to become the Premier League player to score the most successful spot-kicks before missing one.\n\nOn waiting for the goalkeeper to move before striking the ball, he said: \"It's always what I do. I do it well, so it's something I have been training my whole career. I like to have this pressure with these penalties. I'm happy to score.\n\n\"I've never missed [a penalty in the Premier League]. I'm really happy about that, so I want to keep doing it like that. More penalties to come, I'll be there.\"\n\nBryan Mbeumo joined the 100% club when he made it 10 from 10 in April but that perfect record was ended when he had a penalty saved for Brentford against Fulham a month later.\n\nFormer Brentford team-mate Ivan Toney was another who had scored 10 out of 10 but he was unable to match Toure's record when he missed his 11th penalty against Newcastle in 2023.",

    "fullText": "A host of top sports stars and governing bodies have expressed fears that playing fields across England could be built on and disappear if proposed planning reforms come into force.\n\nFormer Lioness Jill Scott, and Olympic champions Sir Mo Farah and Alex Yee are among those to sign an open letter saying they are \"deeply concerned\" by the potential removal of statutory protections for the facilities.\n\nOther signatories included the heads of the Football Association (FA), the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).\n\nThe government is considering stripping funding agency Sport England of its right to be consulted before a playing field is built on.\n\nIt is part of a plan by ministers to speed up planning decisions as it looks to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.\n\nBut with a consultation underway, the signatories said: \"Playing fields are irreplaceable - and Sport England's statutory consultee role is an important line of defence.\n\n\"Weakening this protection risks accelerating the loss of the very spaces that make grassroots sport and physical activity possible, at a time when participation is growing and demand has never been higher. \"\n\nSport England declined to comment, but this month said it protected more than a thousand playing fields across the country last year. Tasked with increasing physical activity, it has had to be consulted on planning decisions for the past 30 years after an estimated 10,000 playing fields were lost in the 1980s and early '90s.\n\nThe letter has been written by Fields in Trust, a charity that works with local authorities and communities to protect parks and playing fields from development.\n\nIts president, former midfielder Scott, said: \"Bringing together so many people for this letter has been incredibly personal to me. Too many communities risk losing these very spaces. I urge the government to listen carefully. We're not asking for the impossible. We're asking them to protect what already exists, for the generations who will come after us.\"\n\nThe signatories - which also include Eilish McColgan, Sir Matthew Pinsent, Tessa Sanderson, and the heads of UK Athletics, British Cycling and Parkrun, are calling on ministers \"to ensure that any planning reforms retain a meaningful mechanism to protect playing fields and sports facilities for future generations.\n\n\"This is about social justice. The people who need green space the most often have the least access. Without these protections, the health and wellbeing of communities will suffer. \"\n\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \"There are already strong protections in place for playing fields which we are proposing to keep and we are investing £400m into grassroots sport.\"\n\nBBC Sport has been told no decision will be made until the results of the consultation are fully considered. The government is proposing to remove the Gardens Trust and the Theatres Trust as statutory consultees as well as Sport England, which is expected to reduce more than 3,000 consultations annually.\n\nThis month, the government said there will need to be a sharp surge in housebuilding to meet its promise to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.\n\nBuilders have warned the government will miss its target, after the number of new homes started fell from 207,000 to 139,000 after Labour took office - the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLast week, Women in Sport said: \"Now is not the time to be putting our playing fields and pitches at risk.\n\n\"Any loss of this space now would come at a critical moment, excluding more women and girls from sport and stunting the growth of one of the UK's biggest success stories.\"\n\nIt is among a number of sports bodies urging members to support a petition titled 'Do not remove Sport England as a statutory consultee for planning applications'.\n\nIt has been signed by almost 16,000 people.",

The vehicle’s driver died at the scene, and a passenger died later in hospital.\n\nZampella began his career in video games in the mid-1990s. Most recently, he had been promoted to head of the Battlefield military shooter series of video games at EA Games – Battlefield 6 was released in October to critical acclaim.\n\nPreviously, in 2010, he founded Respawn Entertainment under EA, which created the Titanfall series of mech shooters and the popular multiplayer game Apex Legends.\n\nZampella is best known for his time in the 2000s at Infinity Ward, a studio he co-founded with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002. There, he co-created the Call of Duty video game series and some of its most acclaimed entries, including Modern Warfare (2007) and Modern Warfare 2 (2009).\n\nThe Call of Duty games have gone on to sell more than 500m copies. In 2010, he was involved with other former Infinity Ward staff in a lawsuit against the series’ publisher, Activision, over unpaid royalties.\n\nIn a statement on Monday night, EA said: “This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work.\n\n“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”",

    "fullText": "and \n Phil Owen\n on December 22, 2025 at 12:39PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWhat makes a bad Fortnite skin? There's no objective measure, certainly. After eight years and more than 2,000 skins, Fortnite's library of character skins has something for just about everybody. Since there's so much variety and so many different styles of skins, it would be silly to make this list of the worst Fortnite skin be focused on skins we simply think are ugly. Instead, we'll focus on other criteria--like if a skin is boring, a cheap cash grab, or broken in some way. Let's take a look.\n\nWhen it was revealed that Fortnite would hold a Star Wars mini-season in May 2025, fans were excited to see the new skins that would be coming to the battle pass and the item shop. And while most of the skins were great picks, it was a little baffling that the final new skin of the season was Apprentice Rey. Apprentice Rey had two style options: grey version of the existing Rey skin, and Sith Rey--who appeared for about half a second in everyone's least favorite Star Wars move. It was a weird move when there are still plenty of well liked Star Wars characters that have never had a Fortnite skin at all. -PO\n\nAt first glance, Fortnite's Nutcracker skin is pretty decent. But if you look closer, you'll realize that this is just a Chapter 1 default character with a Nutcracker helmet, whose clothes were painted Nutcracker colors. Since this skin was released in Fortnite's very first season, we might be willing to cut them a little slack on this one--but not until they drop a new, more legit Nutcracker skin. -PO\n\nFortnite celebrated the launch of Marvel Rivals by selling this pretty hideous Doctor Doom skin. This thing is much uglier than the previous Doom skins, and also it's bulky in ways that make it irritating to play with. Shoulder pads that stick that far out on a skin this enormous? Forget about it. -PO\n\nYears before Quentin Tarantino ever considered making a Fortnite movie, Epic collaborated with Universal Monsters to make what was supposed to be a series of short films about the adventures of a new, Fortnite-original Bride of Frankenstein. The first short film was pretty good, but the design of the character was pretty bland and didn't feel much like any version of the character anybody had any affection for. And then they never released any more shorts, and this skin was largely forgotten. -PO\n\nWhile more recent versions of Lexa have been popular, the original cel shaded Lexa is a horror show that's been giving Fortnite kids nightmares for most of the past decade. Her weird red eyes are particularly haunting. -PO\n\nIn a vacuum, this is a perfectly OK new Midas skin. But when you're dropping $30 on a pack of DC Comics skins, it's pretty annoying to see this guy in there instead of a character from DC Comics. This isn't even a mashup skin--Midas Rex is just an unrelated guy taking up space in a very expensive pack. And to make things even worse, this is the only Midas who doesn't have the Midas Touch effect that makes every gun you pick up gold. So it's not even a good Midas. -PO\n\nThis guy, who was the main character on the heist-themed Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass, looks like somebody decided to reboot Ocean's 11 with Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins taking over the lead role from George Clooney. There is nobody on Earth who wants that, except maybe Ninja himself, so this skin is best sent to the archive. -PO\n\nThere have been some great skins to come from Lego passes, like Andy Fangerson and Chewbacca. And then there have been some that were not so great, like this lady who's wearing a red-painted version of the Chapter 2 default outfit.\n\nThis isn't a ranked list, but if it were, this would be number one with a bullet. Mincemeat is not only one of the worst skins in Fortnite, but one of the strangest character designs in a video game in the past few years. While I have to give Epic credit for creativity when it comes to this concept--a terrifying pie man straight out of a horror movie--perhaps there's a reason that no other game thought to feature a skin like this. I appreciate Epic sticking with the Halloween theme, but this confection is ugly and unappealing, and only good for scaring your younger relatives.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial selection on this list, Fabio Sparklemane has divided Fortnite players for years now. I know that the rainbow-haired stallion has his defenders out there, but for me, he looks like a DeviantArt rip-off of a certain beloved child's television show starring colorful horses--a license that Epic could definitely swing if they were so inclined. Perhaps Fabio's generic, NPC-esque appearance is part of the appeal for some players, but for me, he sticks out like a sore thumb, and not in a good way. -SW\n\nFortnite's zombie skins were a major success, and players couldn't get enough of its soccer skins, too. However, the decision to combine the two for yet another Halloween skin led to some underwhelming results. While the skin isn't quite as uncreative as some on this list--the monstrous ball is a nice touch--it's such a specific combination of ideas that it doesn't have much appeal, except perhaps around Halloween time. No wonder this skin is often listed as one of the game's least-popular. -SW\n\nThe first Legendary item on this list, Flytrap is simply one of those skins that makes you ask \"why?\" The character's Poison Ivy-inspired design isn't the worst starting point, but it quickly goes downhill from there, especially in the color coordination department. When I look at Flytrap, I think of a rotting grapefruit, or perhaps your friend's homemade cosplay for a supervillain that you've never heard of. Though Flytrap isn't the worst skin on this list, Fortnite has come a long way since 2018, and you're better off spending those 2,000 V-Bucks elsewhere. -SW\n\nThis skin is another example of a Fortnite design that occupies a liminal halfway point between referencing another media property and making Epic's own version of it. In this example, the ratty bear-suit looks like something that a Five Nights at Freddy's fan might draw up in class, but it ends up as the example that might come up when you Google the word \"fursuit.\" It's inevitable that some skins in a game like Fortnite are going to fall into this category, and Clover Team Leader is merely a recent example. That said, it's quite ugly, so it makes the list. -SW\n\nOne of the very first skins ever sold in Fortnite's Item Shop, Renegade is a great example of how far the game's skins have come since its 2017 origins. In this case, Epic wants you to pay 800 V-Bucks for essentially the default Banshee skin with a shirt that's red instead of orange. Reskins and palette swaps are a well-trod tradition in video games, but unless you're a hardcore Banshee fan, there's really no reason to spend actual money on this. Renegade isn't a particularly terrible skin, but it's here as a stand-in for all of the weak tea reskins that Epic has put in the shop over the years, and it deserves a spot for that reason alone. -SW\n\nThis '80s-themed \"Spandex Squad\" duo have to be one of the all-time strangest ideas for a Fortnite skin ever. When you consider that the average Fortnite player was born at least 15 to 20 years after this fad and aesthetic had already died off, it's easy to see why it's one of the least-popular skins in the game. The actual execution of the jazz cup-esque color scheme is pretty competent, and the hair effects are well-done, too. This is just one skin that's in the game for the dads out there, and there's nothing wrong with that. But you can understand why most players want nothing to do with it. -SW",

Across social media, attempts by the university to protect his privacy were painted as proof of guilt.\n\nThose who libeled Kharbouch were not anonymous social media trolls but some of the country’s most powerful figures, including prominent plutocrats such as Shaun Maguire and Bill Ackman, government officials like US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, lawmakers such as Representative Anna Paulina Luna, and influencers such as Laura Loomer (who is known to have the ear of President Donald Trump). These figures used their considerable megaphones to try to destroy the life of a private citizen. This racist mob operated with reckless disregard for the truth, likely because they knew that Islamophobia enjoys near-total impunity in the United States. To date, this story has not been covered in mainstream media outlets such as The New York Times. This itself is evidence of now normalized vicious Islamophobia has become.\n\nTo understand Kharbouch’s horrific experience, it is necessary to lay out the facts of two murder cases. The best available evidence indicates that on Saturday, December 13, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente went on a shooting spree that killed two people and injured nine at Brown University. Two days later, while still at large, Valente killed MIT scientist Nuno Loureiro, whom Valente had known in his native Portugal. Valente killed himself on December 16. His body was found two days later. The police and FBI seem to have been extremely inept in investigating the case and broke it only with the help of a Reddit post.\n\nThe incompetence of law enforcement allowed racist and Islamophobic conspiracy theories to run wild. The two interrelated conspiracy theories were that Kharbouch was the murderer and that Loureiro was murdered because he was Jewish and an ardent Zionist. The Daily Mail reported that “Israeli officials” believe Loureiro was “assassinated in his home in [a] targeted attack by [an] Iranian operative.” This reporting was nonsense. There is no evidence that Loureiro was either Jewish or a Zionist. As best as can be discovered, Valente’s motives for the murders were personal, based on frustration over his failed academic career.\n\nAn AFP fact-check gives a useful rundown of how the smear against Karbouch spread:\n\nThe allegations appeared to originate with the anonymous X account “@0hour1,” which repeatedly posted photos and videos of Kharbouch on December 15, sometimes alongside images police had released of the person of interest. The student’s photos and email address were quickly plastered across X, sparking calls for their punishment or death.\n\nMany posts highlighted the student’s documented history of pro-Palestinian activism, while several attempted to compare the individual’s body and gait to a person of interest shown in footage released by police….\n\nRight-wing podcaster Tim Pool and US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon joined in amplifying the narrative, which gained further momentum as Brown University webpages mentioning Kharbouch or listing their contact information appeared to be removed, fueling claims of a cover-up. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman also reshared multiple posts floating the allegations.\n\nTo protect Kharboch from doxing, Brown University scrubbed information about him from its website. This was taken by Islamophobes as evidence of guilt.\n\nAs Fast Company reports, Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire promoted false accusations about Kharbouch, as well as the erroneous theory of the motivation for Loureiro’s murder. On the social medial site X, the journalist Jasper Nathanial posted a video that Maquire had made about the murders and subsequently deleted. Summing up the video, Nathaniel noted:\n\n[Maguire] claims there is “very strong evidence” that Mustapha Kharbouch, a Palestinian Brown student, “likely” committed the murders of two Brown students. He treats Brown removing pages about Kharbouch as evidence of guilt, completely lost on him that this was a response to doxxing like his. He also falsely claims the slain MIT professor was Jewish and frames the killings as part of a history of “pro-Palestinian terrorism” that he says is supported by [Zohran] Mamdani.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Kharbouch spoke of his experiences: “I woke up on Tuesday morning to unfounded, vile, Islamophobic, and anti-Palestinian accusations being directed toward me online. Instead of grieving with my community in the aftermath of the horrible shooting, I received non-stop death threats and hate speech.”\n\nIt’s possible that Kharbouch might be able to get some redress through the courts by launching libel actions against those who defamed him. But this legal remedy won’t touch the larger problem of out-of-control islamophobia.\n\nAs Washington Post columnist Shadi Hamid notes, rabid expressions of hatred for Muslims have become normal on the right in the Trump era. To cite one example, on December 14, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville tweeted, “Islam is not a religion. It’s a cult. Islamists aren’t here to assimilate. They’re here to conquer.” Vile comments like this have become the norm among Republicans, while Democratic pushback has too often been perfunctory. The defamation campaign against Kharbouch could easily have led to his being physically harmed or killed. Unless Islamophobia and other forms of racism are fought head-on, the US is headed for a dark future.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.
