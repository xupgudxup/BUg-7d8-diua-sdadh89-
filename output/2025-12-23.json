With the league's practice requirement met, Denver's alternate helmet is now prepped for a special Christmas Day showdown with a division rival.\n\nThe Broncos will complete an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and white socks.

Denver previously wore its alternate blue jersey on Monday Night Football against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 4, and its throwback look against the Dallas Cowboys (Week 8) and Raiders (Week 10). The Broncos will wear the beautiful throwback uniform again against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18 (Jan. 3/4).\n\nDenver unveiled a new uniform wardrobe last year, and the NFL relaxed its rules this offseason, allowing teams to wear alternate helmets with non-alterate jerseys, which is why Denver can wear its alternate helmet with its standard road jersey.\n\nBroncos fans can also look forward to the team's upcoming \"Rivalries\" series uniform, which is set to arrive in 2027.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL news: Broncos announce uniform for Christmas game vs. Chiefs",

Reports surfaced last Wednesday that New York and the right-handed reliever were finalizing a two-year contract worth $22 million.\n\n\"Over the past few seasons Luke has emerged as one of the most reliable leverage relievers in baseball and we're excited to add him to our pen,\" said Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns. \"Luke's stuff, combined with his experience in high pressure situations in New York, sets him up well for success going forward.\"\n\nWeaver, 32, spent the past two-plus seasons with the Yankees, who claimed him off waivers in September 2023.\n\nIn 148.2 IP over 126 regular-season games from 2024-25, Weaver went 11-7 with a 3.21 ERA and 0.969 WHIP.\n\n\"He got a really good deal that he earned,\" said Yankees manager Aaron Boone this past Friday. \"When we got him, it seemed like not a big move at the time, late in the '23 season -- to turn into the reliever and the role he ended up having for us.\n\n\"He threw a lot of really big games and productive games over the last couple of years -- credit to him for going out there and making a little alter to his career and it truly paying dividends for him.\"\n\nWeaver's MLB career has included stints with the St. Louis Cardinals (2016-18), Arizona Diamondbacks (2019-22), Kansas City Royals (2022), Cincinnati Reds (2023) and Seattle Mariners (2023).\n\nThe Cardinals selected Weaver from Florida State University with the No. 27 overall pick in the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft.",

    "fullText": "Lando Norris has taken on McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown in a karting challenge with DeWalt and eBay.\n\nJoined by Sky Sports F1 commentator David Croft, the pair had three challenges, including a slalom, a pitstop in which they removed a wheel on a separate kart before taking on a full hot lap.\n\n\"If Lando does win, then you probably need to go around to his flat and wash his car,\" Croft joked to Brown, who agreed there was \"a lot on the line today\".\n\nAfter Norris sailed through the challenges, with his only slight hiccup being the pitstop task, Brown hopped into the kart. Brown managed a time of 2m36s, including 15 seconds' worth of penalties for driving through cones, and Norris claimed victory with a time of 2m31s, which included a five-second penalty.\n\nNorris proudly took the trophy and joked that Brown couldn't touch it. \"They don't allow me to keep my trophies, but this one is all mine. So, McLaren aren't getting this one,\" he said with a smile.\n\nMcLaren clinched both the constructors' and drivers' championship titles in 2025 with Norris celebrating his first title. The British driver joined the McLaren Driver Development Programme in 2017 before making his Formula 1 debut with the Woking outfit in 2019. He has grown with the team over the past seven years.\n\n\"Oh, God. I've not cried in a while. I didn't think I would cry, but I did,\" Norris said after the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. \"It's a long journey. It's a long journey. First of all, I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren... My parents.\n\n\"I'm not crying... My mum, my dad. They're the ones who supported me since the beginning.\n\n\"It feels amazing. I now know what Max feels like a little bit. I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors the whole season. It's been a pleasure to race against both of them. It's been an honour. I've learned a lot from both of them as well. I've enjoyed it. It's been a long year. But we did it. We did it. I'm so proud of everyone.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "title": "Famous Idaho Potato Bowl: Utah State puts up dud against Washington State in its third consecutive bowl loss",
    "description": "Utah State hasn’t had much luck in recent bowl games, but optimism surrounds the school’s athletic department regardless",
    "fullText": "It was an ugly look for Utah State in its Famous Idaho Potato Bowl performance on Monday.\n\nThe issues were nothing new with the lack of QB protection, struggles on third downs and a missed field goal. Still, the result is the same, and the Aggies walked away with a 34-21 loss against future Pac-12 foe Washington State.\n\nMonday’s loss was the third straight bowl game loss for the Aggies.\n\n“We just ultimately didn’t play consistently enough, really in any phase, to end up having a chance to take over and win the game,” said Aggies head coach Bronco Mendenhall. “When there are moments we start to battle back, our execution didn’t hold, or our consistency didn’t hold, and that’s exactly where we were. So, I’m looking forward to the continued growth of this program, really looking forward to the Pac-12.”\n\nThe offense looked bad at times and inept in others. For the first time this season, Utah State was completely shut out in the first half.\n\nAs they had for much of the season, the problems started with the offensive line. Washington State’s defense had three sacks, six TFLs and four QB hurries in the win.\n\nUtah State had a total of just 49 yards in the first half.\n\n“(Washington State’s defense) was outstanding and there’s a reason they’ve been statistically strong not only this year at Washington State but the defensive coordinator, the previous two years, and his FCS staff were leading the country in defense,” Mendenhall said. “So, really strong scheme, really good players that execute well within that. Again, they were consistent. They were consistently better, really, in most circumstances until the very end, where we were able to make a last-minute push.”\n\nWashington State also dominated time of possession, 35:48 to Utah State’s 24:12. The Aggies also converted on only three of 13 total third downs.\n\nBryson Barnes had very little protection all day and finished his final college game with 116 passing yards, no touchdowns and one interception.\n\nBarnes ran it into the end zone for Utah State’s first touchdown in the third quarter. It was his 10th rushing touchdown of the year, which extends his school record.\n\nDespite giving up 34 points and 628 yards, the Utah State defense played decently well. It held Washington State to 14 points in the first half. It also had two sacks, nine TFLs and three interceptions.\n\nThe issue arose when the offense couldn’t stay on the field, forcing the defense back onto the field. It played well in red zone situations, but the defense was just asked to do too much.\n\nWashington State largely got it done in the air. Quarterback Zevi Eckhaus led with 334 passing yards and three touchdown passes. The Cougars finished with a total of 373 passing yards.\n\n“You have to give Washington State credit because they were executing,” Mendenhall said. “There was really no intent nor capability to run the ball in the first half. Washington State was mostly in the air, and they had success being able to run the football in the second half, which then kept our defense off balance in playing run calls, pass calls, and neither very consistently, which led to some big plays.”\n\nThe game went from bad to worse for Utah State as Ike Larsen was ejected from the game in the third quarter following a targeting call. He finished with an interception for the Aggies in his final game.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Barnes went down after taking a rough hit and exited the game.\n\nBackup quarterback Jacob Conover did give the Aggies a slight boost and something positive to look at on the stat sheet. He finished with 78 yards and two touchdown passes.\n\n“We preach just always being ready,” Conover said. “I think that just goes to show the culture that Coach Mendenhall has established. Week 13, guys are going down and it just shows the relentlessness of our team.”\n\nMonday’s bowl game felt emblematic of all the issues Utah State had. It showed that it often had the talent to play with good teams, but a few Achilles heels kept it below its potential.\n\nThe Utah State program has been full of optimism about the future over the past few weeks. Despite ending the season with two losses in its final three games, the guys were excited to get one last game.\n\nThat, combined with the excitement of a new conference and the stability of a seasoned FBS coach, created a hopeful atmosphere around the program. The poor bowl game performance definitely left a bad taste in the mouth, but it hasn’t dampened any excitement for the future of football in Logan.\n\n“I’m thrilled with the direction of Utah State football, but also Utah State athletics,” Mendenhall said. “Our athletic director is here, and I think there’s just fantastic leadership and alignment that exists there. Our new president is, man, the trifecta seems to be lined up really well. I certainly have to do my part, but I love the leadership, I love the direction, I love the support and now I love the opportunity with a new league and this program.”",

    "fullText": "DK Metcalf timeline of trouble, from Fred Warner fight and arguing with officials to punching Lions fan originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSince he entered the league in 2019, DK Metcalf has been known as one of the NFL's most productive wide receivers -- but also one of its most explosive personalities.\n\nFirst with the Seattle Seahawks, then with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Metcalf has earned a bit of a reputation for off-the-field antics, including the NFL having to discipline him. While Metcalf's dominance on the field has been a sight to behold at times, he's also been a distraction to his team at others.\n\nMetcalf has a long list of fines from the league for incidents ranging from fights and unnecessary roughness penalties, plus a 2025 suspension due to his physical interaction with a Detroit Lions fan.\n\nHere's a full timeline of Metcalf's off-the-field incidents since he entered the NFL.\n\nWhat to know about DK Metcalf getting physical with a spectator\n\nMeet Ryan Kennedy, the fan that DK Metcalf threw a punch at during Lions-Steelers game\n\nMetcalf has picked up 16 career fines from the NFL, per Spotrac, and the first came in December 2020.\n\nMetcalf, as part of a touchdown celebration, jumped into the stands — which were without fans during ongoing COVID-19 protocols — and took the broadcast camera from Fox's camera operator, moved it around a bit, then returned to the field.\n\nThe NFL then fined him $6,131 for that celebration.\n\nLmao DK Metcalf stealing the media camera and using it for his TD celebration. #Seahawkspic.twitter.com/I9mmXWevBi\n\n— Samuel Gold (@SamuelRGold) December 13, 2020\n\nIn a two-week span in October 2021, Metcalf was hit with a pair of NFL fines. First, after a matchup against the Saints, he earned a fine for unsportsmanlike conduct after a few scrums with cornerback Marshon Lattimore. Both players were fined for their roles in the incidents, seen shoving, grabbing at face masks and jawing at each other throughout the night.\n\nThen, on Halloween during the 2021 season, Metcalf was hit with a taunting fine in Week 8 after a Seahawks win over the Jaguars.\n\nMetcalf leaped up and hugged the goal post during a celebration, which he said was a reference to Antonio Brown previously doing the same, but the NFL wound up fining him $6,949 for the antics.\n\nHOW did @dkm14 make this catch 😱😱 😱\n\n📺: #JAXvsSEA on CBS pic.twitter.com/fQYMx6dVSY\n\n— x - Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) October 31, 2021\n\nMetcalf responded to his fine on social media, surprising at how much he was fined for a simple hug of the goal post.\n\nShiiii, Ain’t no hug worth that much bruh https://t.co/d16dwXb6vwpic.twitter.com/15FPHrRKy0\n\n— DeKaylin Metcalf (@dkm14) November 6, 2021\n\nThe 2021 season continued to be a busy one for Metcalf in Week 10, when his emotions boiled over during a 17-0 loss to the Packers. With less than two minutes remaining in the game, the receiver got into a fight with Packers safety Henry Black after grabbing Black's facemask during a scuffle.\n\nMetcalf was ejected for fighting, then also received a $6,949 fine.\n\n#Seahawks WR DK Metcalf has been ejected after this altercation with #Packers DB Henry Black.pic.twitter.com/Ry1jdhIOpd\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) November 15, 2021\n\nPlenty of NFL players debate with officials, pleading their case for the right call, but Metcalf seemed to have taken it too far in November 2022. In Week 10, he was flagged during the Seahawks' matchup against the Buccaneers after arguing an uncalled defensive pass interference penalty in the end zone.\n\nThe NFL proceeded to hit him with a $29,785 fine for arguing with an official, and while Metcalf appealed the fine, it was upheld. Per Adam Schefter, Metcalf was said to asked the official in the game if a play was pass interference, and the official was said to respond, “Did I throw a flag?”\n\nToward the end of the 2022 regular season, Metcalf received two fines from the NFL. The first came following Week 13 against the Rams, as Metcalf heat-butted opposing cornerback Jalen Ramsey and was called for unsportsmanlike conduct, then fined $10,609.\n\n“Yeah, I head-butted him on purpose,” Metcalf said, per the Seattle Times. “The official’s right there. [Ramsey] pushed me, so I head-butted him. It’s football.”\n\nThen, when the Seahawks and Rams met a few weeks later in January, Metcalf was fined another $21,219 for unsportsmanlike conduct in an exchange with Ramsey.\n\nMetcalf's troublemaking against the Rams continued into the 2023 season. In Week 1, Seattle took on L.A., and Metcalf had an ugly series where he blindsided safety Ahkello Witherspoon with a late hit to the ground, which wasn't part of the play.\n\nThat was then followed by a taunting penalty, meaning Metcalf received a pair of fines for a total of $21,854 from the NFL.\n\nFrustrations boiling over for the Seahawks right now 😬\npic.twitter.com/GvF7Kbkdqn\n\n— PFF (@PFF) September 10, 2023\n\nSeahawks head coach Pete Carroll later said Metcalf had to start to \"elevate above\" the antics, as his fines and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties were becoming a theme.\n\n\"DK and I talked for a long time last night about [how] that's not what we can allow to happen because that means that they can control him and get after him,\" Carroll said on his Seattle Sports 710-AM radio show, per ESPN. \"So, he has to elevate above that. So it's a challenge. This is nothing new. DK's been an emotional, feisty, fiery player since the day he got here, and that is who he is. But he has to also manage that so they don't take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe penalties continued for Metcalf in Weeks 2 and 3 of the 2023 season, as he was first flagged for a facemask on safety Kerby Joseph against the Lions, resulting in a fine of $10,927.\n\nThen, in Week 3, Metcalf was fined $16,391 by the NFL for an unnecessary roughness penalty against the Panthers, which resulted from him laying an illegal blindside block on a Carolina defender.\n\nWeek 6 of the 2023 season saw Metcalf get into a spat with Cincinnati Bengals DB Cam Taylor-Britt.

    "description": "The John R.",
    "fullText": "The John R. Wooden Award will celebrate it's 50th anniversary this season. Leading up to the award ceremony on April 10, 2026, The Sporting Tribune in partnership with the Wooden Award and the Los Angeles Athletic Club will highlight past winners of the Wooden Award and the Legends of Coaching Award.\n\nWhen Rick Barnes was handed the 2018 Coach Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award, it was noted how his life displayed the character traits of integrity and leadership in the game of basketball, reflecting the values of legendary coach John Wooden.\n\nIt's long been the University of Tennessee coach's mantra, consistently blending culture, development, and adaptability for the young men he's mentored since beginning his coaching career in 1977.\n\nBarnes, who ranks among the all-time Top 20 winningest men's college basketball coaches, hasn't just been a coach who wins games; he's built sustainable programs.\n\nBarnes turned Clemson into a national contender in the 1990s, he elevated Texas into a national power with regular NBA talent, and more recently, he's rebuilt Tennessee into one of the SEC’s most consistent teams.\n\nBarnes went to the Final Four with Texas in 2003, won the Big East Tournament with Providence in 1994 and the SEC Tournament in 2022 with Tennessee.\n\nHe's also won a combined five regular-season conference championships with Texas and Tennessee.\n\nThere have been very few coaches who have succeeded at three different top-tier major schools.\n\nThough he's known for being a demanding coach, he's never fallen short of the respect he's received from players.\n\nBarnes has always been clear about his standards for effort and behavior. His players have learned there are no shortcuts toward minutes earned, and he's always allowed for strong locker-room leadership\n\nMany of his former players often talk about how much Barnes helped them mature as men, not just as athletes, a culture that leads to consistency year after year.\n\nAs for his coaching style, Barnes' teams are almost always physically tough behind a disciplined defense. They've typically been stellar with their half-court defense.\n\nHis teams have long been known for elite defensive efficiency, ball pressure, and rebounding. Defense has consistently given him a reliable floor every season, even when the offense fluctuates.\n\nEmphatic about established player development, Barnes always excels at developing players who elect to stay multiple years under his tutelage. Guards have been known to improve their decision-making and tenacity, his bigs get fundamentally stronger defensively and role players have notoriously grown into stars.\n\nMany of his best teams weren’t loaded with one-and-done talent, but with grown, experienced players who understood their roles.\n\nHis roster-building skills generally start with his knack for recruiting players who fit the system before they even arrive in the locker room.\n\nRather than chasing only top-5 recruits, Barnes prioritizes toughness, coachability and a defensive-mindset.\n\nCurrently, at Tennessee, Barnes has found players who fit the SEC grind and who buy into a team-basketball philosophy.\n\nUltimately, that translates into a mirror image of Barnes, who promotes consistency over flash.\n\nDespite being criticized for not having a national title, Barnes' real strength has producing his fair share of winning seasons, regular NCAA tournament appearances, getting his players to commit to higher standards and promoting the type of reliability that is extremely valuable in college basketball.\n\nThis former Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award winner will go down as someone known as a teacher, culture-builder and defensive tactician who adapted over six decades without worrying about flash, but more so toughness and competitive consistency year after year.",

    "description": "What the Astros should do with 3B Isaac Paredes has not only been polarizing to the fans but a true point of contention with the franchise.

    "fullText": "What the Astros should do with 3B Isaac Paredes has not only been polarizing to the fans but a true point of contention with the franchise. Paredes is coming off the second best statistical season of his career, but it is also one year removed from one of his worst.\n\nIn his four mostly-full seasons, Paredes has alternated between OPS seasons of .739/.740, and OPS seasons of 800+. For his career, he is a .237 hitter with a .337 career OBP and .766 career OPS.\n\nLast season, Paredes performed above his career norms, batting .254 with a .352 OBP and .809 OPS. It should also be noted that prior to suffering a torn hamstring, Paredes was batting .259 with a .359 OBP and .829 OPS, and that his final numbers went down a bit while he heroically tried to play on one leg down the stretch.\n\nParedes reestablished himself as a power bat at a premium position, and has two years of team control (Paredes qualified as a Super 2 player, so he has 4 arbitration years, and is entering Arb 3).\n\nWhen Paredes went down July 19, he was the Astros best hitter to date, with a combination of power and plate discipline (noted by an OBP approximately 100 points higher than his batting average) that the Astros have wanted to get back to as a team over the last few years but have struggled to do so.\n\nAs a result, Paredes’ trade value around MLB is very strong. With an arbitration number this year of approximately $10M, Paredes represents a terrific value at a position where performances like Paredes’ last season are uncommon.\n\nWith Chandler Rome’s report yesterday that Paredes was making his Winter League debut, that would indicate that Paredes is ahead of schedule in his return from his hamstring injury. Previously, it had been reported that Paredes was not expected to be 100% entering Spring Training and may not be fully healed when the season started. With Paredes now playing winter ball, it lends credence to the idea that Paredes may be closer to full health than previously thought and be at or close to 100% entering Spring Training.\n\nThis not only means that Paredes could be healthy enough to play 1B and 2B in February, but also increases his trade value as any fears over lingering injury issues that interested teams may have had.\n\nParedes injury last season also forced the Astros, then in first place, to make trades to acquire more infielders. They traded for Ramon Urias, with the idea he could play both 2B and 3B, and then later took advantage of the Twins fire sale and re-acquired SS Carlos Correa who agreed to move to 3B.\n\nCorrea is a former Gold Glove SS who looked every bit the part of a Gold Glove 3B once in Houston. Paredes, to be fair, is not a comparable defender to Correa. Last season, Paredes was worth -3 Outs Above Average (OAA) – he’s a below average defender (not to be confused with a ‘bad defender’, which he is not)\n\nChristian Walker is a former 3-time Gold Glover from 2022-2024 with Arizona. Despite a subpar overall season, Walker did post numbers \n\nLast season, Walker hit .229 with a .286 OBP and .660 OPS, with 12 HR and 47 RBI over 377 PA (including 23 BB) in the first half. In the second half, Walker hit .250 with a .312 OBP and .799 OPS with 15 HR and 41 RBI over 263 PA (including 17 BB).\n\nHow much his first half was impacted by a rushed recovery from an oblique injury suffered during Spring Training (the same injury that kept him out over 2 months the season before in Arizona) can’t be measured but should be taken into consideration. It should also be taken into consideration that his second half would project to a full season (650 PA) of 37 HR and 101 RBI, exactly the kind of power production the Astros wanted to have hitting behind Yordan Alvarez in the lineup last season, and now Yordan and Correa in the lineup this season.\n\nWalker’s glove also gave Correa, Paredes and Jeremy Pena a lot of confidence that they can let throws rip and Walker would come up with them, which he did. Whether or not Paredes can do the same is an unknown.\n\nHence the Astros find themselves in a conundrum. They love Paredes’ approach at the plate, they don’t know what kind of defense he will provide at a position other than 3B, and he clearly has the most value of any batter on their team not named Yordan Alvarez.\n\nThere is a school of thought to trading players when they have reached a zenith in value, and it’s fair to presume that Paredes has hit that zenith this offseason. Considering the Astros stated needs of starting pitching, their bargain bin signings and recent trade for Mike Burrows that cost MiLB CF Jacob Melton (their #2 prospect) and MiLB SP Anderson Brito (their #4 prospect), it stands to reason the best path to the Astros getting the kind of arm that could help replace Framber Valdez (who is not re-signing in Houston) would be in a trade involving Paredes. There is no chance a deal centered around Christian Walker could generate such a return, even with adding another top prospect like Brice Matthews. (Note the Pirates got 3 major league players for Burrows, as the price for controllable SPs is currently astronomical in terms of prospects).\n\nClearly, the team has a issue of having too many players on the infield and not enough places to play them. The Jose Altuve in LF experiment was an abject failure, and he needs to either play 2B or DH. There won’t be a lot of DH reps for anyone with a healthy Yordan Alvarez if Dana Brown’s most recent comments on Yordan getting less time in LF prove true, which locks Altuve at 2B.\n\nTherefore, it stands to reason that Paredes or Walker will be the primary 1B, and that one of them will not be here when the calendar turns to February. Trading Paredes would generate a strong return. Trading Walker would require the Astros pay down part of his contract. For a team that is conscious of it’s current position relative to the first tax line, eating salary for a lesser return seems like a far worse decision than not eating money for a strong return of positions in need.\n\nIn no manner am I advocating that Walker is a better hitter than Paredes or is a better fit in the lineup, but I am advocating that the Astros can get a lot more for Paredes than Walker in terms of value. To get a #2 type young starter with team control (or a young SP with #2 upside) would absolutely require trading Paredes to reallocate his money/roster spot to that particular pitcher. Ideally the pitcher would earn less than Paredes and the team would have a net gain in salary, potentially allowing them to make another needed move.\n\nParedes is the kind of younger player a team like Houston should be building around if they were, in fact, rebuilding. However, this team is not rebuilding, they are re-tooling. They still have a roster capable of winning the AL West, they will still have the highest payroll in the AL West, and if they can avoid the “IL of DOOM” type season they had a year ago, they should win the AL West.\n\nJim Crane maintains as long as he is around, the window is always open. If that is going to be the case without punching up a $275M+ payroll, then it is going to require trading Isaac Paredes now and at his highest value to get the pitching they need to get through 162 games and be in the postseason.",

    "fullText": "Monday’s 34-21 loss to Washington State in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl marked the end of Bronco Mendenhall’s first year in Logan. It was also the end of the collegiate road for many of Utah State’s top contributors, including quarterback Bryson Barnes.\n\nWith the season over and the Mountain West era in the past, what’s next for Utah State football?\n\nThe new Pac-12 will officially begin on July 1. The Aggies will see some familiar faces from the Mountain West, but they will also see new faces in Washington State, Oregon State and Texas State.\n\nThe move will mean a jump in competitiveness in conference play, but one that Bronco Mendenhall welcomes wholeheartedly.\n\n“I’m thrilled with the direction of Utah State football, but also Utah State athletics,” Mendenhall said. “... I think there’s just fantastic leadership and alignment that exists there. Our new president is, man, the trifecta seems to be lined up really well. I certainly have to do my part, but I love the leadership, I love the direction, I love the support and now I love the opportunity with a new league and this program.”\n\nArguably, the most significant question the coaching staff needs to answer this offseason regards the quarterback position.\n\nBarnes has had a great season with the Aggies and helped push what’s been an otherwise middling offense.\n\nEven the second-stringer, Jacob Conover, has no years of eligibility left. Conover jumped into Monday’s bowl game after Barnes went down in the fourth quarter. He threw two touchdown passes in his limited time.\n\nBeyond just the quarterback, Mendenhall has a big task of replacing offensive talent such as Braden Pegan. Pegan was the Aggies’ top receiver this year and announced his intent to enter the transfer portal earlier this month.\n\nUtah State is also losing wide receiver Brady Boyd and its top running back, Miles Davis.\n\nMendenhall also has to focus on bolstering the offensive line, which was a significant issue for Utah State all year.\n\nEven defensively, the Aggies are losing significant contributors in John Miller, Ike Larsen and Noah Avinger.",

But his overall production didn't earn him a draft selection.\n\nHe finished his college career in 2024, then hit .306 in the MLB Draft League, but that didn't get him picked.\n\nO'Dowd had to prove himself in indy ball, and he did, with a 1.091 OPS.\n\nNow, O'Dowd is in an organization that will be very familiar for his family. He'll get a chance to prove himself in the minor leagues and see if he can eventually ascend to Coors Field.\n\nReds have a promising prospect named Ichiro Cano\n\nIt's a good day to remember Bob Feller's brilliance and his time in the U.S. Navy\n\nHow Aroldis Chapman is able to pitch for Great Britain in the WBC\n\nMets trade away Jeff McNeil for a 17-year old pitcher\n\nAlex Bregman has a key free agent preference\n\nYankees' pitcher leaving MLB to sign in Japan",

    "fullText": "Week 16 comes to a close with a “Monday Night Football” matchup featuring the San Francisco 49ers (10-4) and the Indianapolis Colts (8-6).\n\nThe 49ers have clinched a playoff berth in the NFC Playoffs—the Detroit Lions can only hope to tie their record, and San Francisco holds the tie-breaker, so they’re in—but they’re still fully in the hunt for seeding and still have a shot at winning their division. Currently, the 49ers are a half-game behind the Rams and a game-and-a-half behind the Seahawks in the NFC West.\n\nMeanwhile, the Colts currently sit in the No. 8 spot in the AFC Playoff picture and third in their division. For Indianapolis, this is a near must-win game for them, as they’re currently a game-and-a-half behind the Texans, who currently hold the No. 7 spot in the AFC Playoffs and are also in second place in the AFC South. If the Colts win this game, they’ll have a 6% chance of making the playoffs, while a loss drops them down to 1%, per the Athletic’s (New York Times’) playoff simulator.\n\nFrom a rooting perspective, because the Lions cannot catch the 49ers in the NFC Playoff seeding, there’s nothing really to root for in this game.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nHere’s how to watch tonight’s game:\n\nWhen: Monday, December 22, 2025 — 8:15 p.m. ET\nWhere: Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana\nTV: ESPN\nAnnouncers: Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, with field reporters Lisa Salters and Laura Rutledge\nOnline streaming: ESPN+, Hulu + Live TV, NFL+\n\nNo Manningcast this week: The Manningcast returns in Week 18\n\nLet’s watch some football together.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nComing into the week, the Los Angeles Rams' quarterback was appearing to walk away with the MVP award with flying colors based on how well he and the team had been playing throughout the season.\n\nHis chances were bolstered even more thanks to the Week 15 loss by another favored MVP candidate, Drake Maye, and the New England Patriots.\n\nHowever, with a critical loss in an overtime thriller to the Seattle Seahawks and the danger of losing the NFC West on 'Thursday Night Football' and Maye having the best performance of his young career against the Baltimore Ravens to clinch a playoff berth, throwing for a career high, 380 passing yards, and leading a fourth quarter comeback, it has arguably become anyone's reward.\n\nStafford and the Rams are currently the fifth seed in the NFC playoff picture at 11-4 and will be heavily favored to win their final two games of the season against the Atlanta Falcons and Arizona Cardinals, but don't control their own destiny to win the division and capture the top seed for the playoffs.\n\nWhereas Maye and the Patriots have the luxury of winning the AFC East by taking care of business against division rivals, the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, who will both miss the postseason, and still have a solid chance at the top seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nThe fact of the NFC West being one of the most competitive divisions in the league, along with the conference as a whole, could bode well for the 17-year veteran, whether Los Angeles has a first-round bye or has to play a road wild-card game.\n\nAlso, Stafford still has the better stats than Maye and every other quarterback, throwing for 4,179 yards and 40 touchdowns, ranking first in both categories, and with only five interceptions, which is best in the top five in the league.\n\nAlthough it may not be as obvious heading into the final two weeks of the season, regardless of what happens, Stafford has made it difficult for anyone to take the MVP award from him.\n\nMatthew Stafford has the chance to accomplish something not seen since 2020. Is it enough for MVP?\n\nRams make coaching change right before the playoffs. Is this a wise decision?\n\nAfter Sean McVay update, how long will the Rams be without Davante Adams?\n\nRams' Matthew Stafford climbs prestigious NFL record list with epic Thursday night stats\n\nCan Matthew Stafford win MVP without a division title for Rams?",

    "title": "The Death and Rebirth of Programming",
    "description": "Programming didn't die all at once. There was no single moment, no dramatic obsolescence event. Instead, something quieter happened: the core constraint that shaped software for seventy years dissolved. Writing code stopped being the hard part.",
    "fullText": "For most of computing history, programming was bottlenecked by human cognition. Translating intent into working software required time, attention, and specialized skill. Even small changes were costly. This scarcity justified entire ecosystems: languages, frameworks, methodologies, reviews, team rituals that made sense when every line was expensive.\n\nGenerative AI removes that scarcity.\n\nToday, a single developer can generate thousands of lines of working code in minutes. Tomorrow, that number will be effectively infinite. The marginal cost of producing code is collapsing toward zero.\n\nWhat hasn't collapsed is the cost of knowing what the code does.\n\nUnderstanding, verifying, securing, and evolving software remain stubbornly expensive. In fact, they may be getting harder as volume explodes. This asymmetry—the ease of creation versus the difficulty of comprehension—is the defining tension of modern software.\n\nProgramming hasn't disappeared. But its center of gravity has shifted.\n\nIn the old world, programmers owned code. You wrote it, you understood it, you maintained it. Your value was tied to mastery of specific implementations. Codebases accrued history, reputation, and power.\n\nIn the new world, ownership becomes a liability.\n\nWhen code can be regenerated faster than it can be understood, preserving it for sentimental or historical reasons no longer makes sense. What matters instead is stewardship: maintaining the system's behavior, boundaries, and intent over time, regardless of how many times its internals are replaced.\n\nThis reframing is subtle but profound:\n\nThe asset is no longer the codebase. The asset is the system's ability to keep working.\n\nThis is the thesis of everything that follows. Architecture, testing, interfaces, team structure: all of it flows from this inversion.\n\nMany of the \"modern\" software practices of the last decade were early adaptations to this shift, even if we didn't articulate them that way.\n\nImmutable infrastructure. Stateless services. Containers. Blue-green deployments. Infrastructure as code.\n\nThese ideas all share a common premise: never fix a running thing. Replace it.\n\nAI pushes this premise beyond infrastructure and into application code itself. When rewriting is cheap, editing in place becomes risky. Mutation accumulates entropy. Replacement resets it.\n\nDisposability stops being a hack. It becomes the default.\n\nThis transition isn't just technical. It's deeply psychological, and that psychology shapes architecture.\n\nMany developers identify as builders and craftspeople. We take pride in elegance, cleverness, and mastery of internals. We accumulate knowledge inside our heads and inside codebases. Longevity feels like validation.\n\nGenerative AI destabilizes this identity.\n\nWhen a machine can produce a competent version of \"your\" solution in seconds, craftsmanship no longer lies in the artifact. It lies in framing the problem, defining success, and deciding what to keep and what to discard.\n\nThe role shifts from maker to architect. From author to managing editor. From preserving code to designing for its replacement.\n\nThat shift is uncomfortable. And the discomfort isn't merely personal. It's what makes teams resist the very patterns that would help them. Developers cling to codebases because identity is at stake, not just technical judgment. Acknowledging this is the first step toward building systems that don't require heroics to change.\n\nResisting the shift doesn't stop it. It just makes systems more fragile.\n\nOne of the clearest signals of this new era is the rise of the n=1 developer.\n\nProjects that once required teams now fit inside a single person's cognitive boundary—with AI filling in the execution gaps. Entire products can be specified, generated, evaluated, and shipped by one human working with machines.\n\nThis isn't about productivity hacks. It's about a structural change in leverage.\n\nBut n=1 development only works if systems are designed for it. Large, tangled, historically accreted codebases collapse under their own weight when AI accelerates change. Small, modular, disposable systems thrive.\n\nThe n=1 developer is not a superhero. They are an indicator species. They are evidence that the environment has changed, and proof that the new patterns actually work.\n\nIt's tempting to frame this as the \"end of programming.\" That's misleading.\n\nWhat's dying is a specific form of programming: one that equates value with authored code, longevity of code with quality, and maintenance with virtue.\n\nWhat's being born is something closer to systems design as an ongoing process of regeneration:\n\nCode becomes an intermediate artifact, not the final product. Rewrites become routine, not traumatic. Tests and evaluations define truth, not files. Stability emerges from replacement, not preservation.\n\nThis is not nihilism. It's pragmatism under new constraints.\n\nThe rest of this publication builds on a single premise established here:\n\nWhen code is cheap and understanding is expensive, architecture must optimize for the impermanence of code.\n\nEverything else (pace layers, evaluations, clean interfaces, regeneration workflows) flows from that fact.\n\nWe are not entering a world with less software. We are entering a world with vastly more of it. The only way to survive that abundance is to stop treating code as precious.\n\nBut it has been reborn, and it expects us to change with it.",

    "fullText": "Software is entering a strange new phase.\n\nFor most of its history, code was expensive to produce and cheap to keep. We treated it like a durable asset: written carefully, maintained lovingly, upgraded cautiously. Whole professions, identities, and institutions grew around this assumption. Programmers were craftsmen. Codebases were cities. Refactoring was urban renewal.\n\nGenerative AI breaks this assumption at the root.\n\nCode is no longer scarce. It is abundant, fast, and increasingly disposable. The limiting factor is no longer writing software, but understanding, evaluating, and governing it. The economics have inverted. The psychology hasn’t caught up.\n\nThis publication exists to explore what comes next.\n\nThe central paradox I want to explore is simple:\n\nWhen code is cheap to generate, preserving it at all costs becomes irrational. Yet we still need systems that are reliable, secure, comprehensible, and long-lived. The solution is not to fight ephemerality but to design around it.\n\nThis means shifting what we treat as permanent.\n\nNot implementations, but interfaces\n\nIn other words: the system is the asset. Code is just a consumable input.\n\nMost software practices today are optimization strategies for a world where code is expensive to write and dangerous to replace. We edit files in place. We fear rewrites. We celebrate longevity of codebases as a proxy for quality.\n\nAI changes the cost curve so dramatically that these habits start to look like technical debt generators.\n\nInstead of maintaining code, we can regenerate it.\nInstead of upgrading in place, we can replace.\nInstead of debugging line by line, we can select between competing implementations.\nInstead of trusting authorship, we can trust evaluation.\n\nThis is not a call for recklessness. It’s a call for discipline—a different kind than we’re used to.\n\nThe metaphor I keep returning to is the phoenix: systems designed to burn and be reborn, continuously, without losing their identity.\n\nA regenerative system has a few defining traits:\n\nClear, durable boundaries that outlive any implementation\n\nTests and evaluations that define correctness independently of code\n\nAutomation that assumes replacement is normal, not exceptional\n\nExplicit acceptance that code will rot, drift, or become incomprehensible\n\nCultural comfort with deletion, rewriting, and starting over\n\nIn such systems, failure is localized, recovery is fast, and improvement emerges through iteration rather than preservation.\n\nThe goal is not immortality of code.\nThe goal is immortality of intent.\n\nRight now, many teams are using generative AI as a productivity multiplier inside old mental models. Faster coding. Bigger diffs. More surface area. Same assumptions.\n\nBut it also accelerates entropy. Larger codebases. Lower comprehension. More fragile systems. Higher cognitive load per developer. The very speed that AI enables becomes a liability.\n\nWe need architectures, workflows, and cultures that treat AI not as a faster typist, but as a fundamentally different substrate for building systems.\n\nWhat “quality” means when code can be rewritten tomorrow\n\nHow we test systems whose implementations are transient\n\nHow we organize teams when one person can ship what used to require many\n\nHow we manage cost when context windows and tokens replace headcount\n\nHow we remain accountable when authorship dissolves\n\nThese are not tooling questions. They are architectural and philosophical ones.\n\nThis will be a slow, cumulative exploration—one post at a time.\n\nTopics I plan to cover include:\n\nPace layers and why different parts of systems should regenerate at different rates\n\nThe idea of n=1 development and what it means for teams and organizations\n\nEvaluations as the true source code\n\nWhy rewriting beats refactoring in the AI era\n\nHow to design interfaces that survive constant replacement\n\nThe economics of code as cost, not capital\n\nCultural shifts required to celebrate deletion instead of preservation\n\nPatterns for building systems that expect to be rewritten\n\nSome posts will be conceptual. Some will be practical. Some will be uncomfortable.\n\nThis is not about hype, nor about dismissing decades of hard-won engineering wisdom. Many of the ideas here build directly on them—immutable infrastructure, test-first design, separation of concerns, automation, evolutionary architectures.\n\nWhat’s changing is the environment.\n\nWhen the substrate shifts, the architecture must follow.\n\nIf you’re building software with AI—or expect to be—you’re already living inside this transition, whether you’ve named it or not. My goal here is to help articulate a vocabulary, a set of patterns, and a philosophy that make the transition legible.\n\nSoftware that lasts will not be frozen in amber.\nIt will be continuously reborn.\n\nWelcome to Regenerative Software.",

    "description": "Part 2 of the series covers some nuances in using the caching architecture pattern and offers some tips in scaling the cache infrastructure for larger loads.",
    "fullText": "In part 1 of this series, we looked at the different types of caches and the various ways they can be used to scale up applications. Now let’s look at some nuances of using caching.\n\nLike any other part of the system design, caches come under load as the scale of the application increases. External caches are servers like any other and can buckle under the read/write traffic being sent their way. Even in-memory caches can suffer degraded performance due to read locking if too many application threads try to access them, although this is much harder to get to and easier to mitigate. let’s look at some problems and solutions scaling caches.\n\nA cache is essentially a data store, and the problem of scaling for traffic is a well-known one in the database domain. Rising traffic can cause scalability problems by increasing the CPU usage or by choking the network bandwidth available to a server.\n\nThe most straightforward way to scale for an increase in traffic is to have multiple servers which can serve the traffic. In databases, we typically configure a master-slave (aka leader-follower) topology where all writes go to a single server which replicates them across all the other servers. This way, all servers have all the data and the application can connect to any of them to read them. This reduces the load on each server by a factor of the number of servers.\n\nSince writes to cache data are much rarer than reads, the overhead of replicating the writes to all slave servers is usually acceptable.\n\nBoth Twemproxy and Redis Sentinel are examples of implementation which use redundancies to scale caches.\n\nWe have already discussed this under external distributed caches. If we want to store more data, we really don’t have a choice but to distribute it across more than one server. This directly brings the cache into the world of distributed systems with all its attendant pros and cons.\n\nNote that distributing data across multiple servers solves for both data and traffic scaling since no single server faces as much traffic as in the case of a single cache instance. However, we can look at only doing redundant deployments if our problem is just traffic and not data volume. Data replication is a simpler problem than data distribution.\n\nBoth Twemproxy and Redis Cluster are examples of distributing data to scale to larger data volumes.\n\nIn high throughput systems, a scenario emerges in the use of caches which, if not handled properly, can bring down the entire system. This has happened to pretty much every large scale company like Facebook, Doordash, Instagram etc. I have personally encountered it while building the Promise Engine at Myntra.\n\nLet’s say that we are using a read-through cache where application processes first try to read data from a cache, and if not found (cache miss) they tried to load it from the source database/system. If this is a high throughput system involving a large number of concurrent accesses to the cache, then even if a single key is missing, a large number of processes will try to access the database to read this data at the same time. This now triggers a flood of traffic to the database, which may now collapse under it since it always expects a cache to sit in front of it and is not designed to take such a heavy spike of traffic.\n\nThis means that a single heavily accessed key being missing from the cache can trigger a complete system collapse. Such is the fine line of high scalability!\n\nBefore we try to solve the problem, please evaluate if this is a problem for your system. If your cache were to vanish and the traffic were to hit your database at once, would the database hold up with perhaps only a temporary spike in latency? If so, you do not need to worry about a cache stampede. It is worthwhile doing a simulation in your production environment to verify this.\n\nIf you think this is going to be a problem for you. there are a few approaches you can take.\n\nThis approach treats the cache as the source of truth. The idea is that since a cache stampede is triggered by a cache miss, if you can load all the data into the cache using a refresh ahead strategy, then a cache miss will never happen and hence cache stampede will be avoided.\n\nWhile this is possible for small datasets, keeping large data set fully loaded at all times is not always feasible for cost reasons.\n\nLet’s say a cache miss occurs when 1000 processes are trying to access a key concurrently. To prevent all of them from rushing to the database, we can implement a mutex lock/leader election mechanism to elect one process which goes to the database to get the data and refresh the cache. The other processes can either wait for the cache to be filled before trying again (leading to temporarily increased latency) or they can all throw an error to their respective callers (leading to a brief spike of errors).\n\nObtaining locks in a distributed environment is a complicated but solved problem. Zookeeper and Redis both offer convenient ways of doing this, but you can roll your own using lock entries in a table if you think it is easier (it isn’t).\n\nThis is a smarter solution than most teams require, but the idea is to balance the above two approaches. If we cannot load all the data in the cache but still want to prevent cache misses, then the only way is to reload the keys intelligently before it expires from the cache. This paper outlines one of the strategies for preemptive loading of keys before they expire.\n\nCache stampede is one instance of the new failure modes introduced into an architecture that uses caching. In designing high scale applications, this outcome of cache miss should be carefully considered before using caches.\n\nRead Next: More articles on architecture patterns.\n\nIf you liked this, subscribe to my weekly newsletter It Depends to read about software engineering and technical leadership",

    "description": "Americans won’t be able to buy new models from DJI, the Chinese maker of most of the world’s drones. But U.S. pilots can keep the drones they have.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Monday that all foreign-made drones and their components posed “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States” and would be put on a federal blacklist of equipment makers prohibited from selling their goods freely in the country.\n\nA fact sheet released by the Federal Communications Commission left some room for exceptions. The Pentagon or the Department of Homeland Security can clear a drone or component for use. But it heralded a new reality that American drone pilots have been dreading for months: New models produced by DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that makes most of the world’s drones, will no longer be sold in the United States. The statement did not mention DJI by name.\n\n“The F.C.C. will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance,” Brendan Carr, the commission’s chairman, said in a statement.\n\nMany of the nearly half a million registered drone pilots in the United States have built small businesses with DJI equipment. The drones perform a variety of jobs, such as spraying farmers’ fields with fertilizer, surveying land, monitoring construction projects and inspecting roofs and utility lines.\n\n“People are pissed — incredibly, incredibly pissed — about the whole thing,” said Vic Moss, the volunteer director of the Drone Advocacy Alliance, which represents pilots who want to continue to buy DJI drones.\n\nOne reason the administration did not try to ban the use of drones that Americans already possess, he said, was that doing so would impede emergency workers. Law enforcement agencies across the country use fleets of DJI drones to track down fleeing suspects, lost hikers and the bodies of children who have washed away in floods.\n\nThe seeds of the decision were planted in Congress a year ago, when the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a determination by Dec. 23, 2025, about whether video surveillance equipment produced by DJI or Autel Robotics, another Chinese manufacturer, posed a security threat. The language came from a bill written by Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who vowed to “ensure Chinese drones are banned from American skies.”\n\nMany in the drone industry expected a comprehensive examination of the technology to see if DJI drones contained secret back doors that shared information with entities in China. Instead, the decision appears to have been based on a simple review of what government agencies already knew.\n\nFor months, DJI has written letters to U.S. officials asking for a rigorous audit.\n\n“We stand ready to work with you, to be open and transparent, and provide you with the necessary information to complete a thorough review,” Adam Welsh, head of global policy for DJI, wrote in a letter this month to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others.\n\nThe decision, while not unexpected, deeply disappointed drone pilots around the country, most of whom own and operate DJI equipment.\n\nDaCoda Bartels, chief operating officer of FlyGuys, a company that connects commercial drone pilots with freelance work around the country, said he owned the first DJI drone — the Phantom V-1 — and every updated version since then. Now, he faces the prospect of being cut off from the improvements that the company releases each year.\n\n“DJI as a company will still be innovating and offering their products in other countries,” Mr. Bartels said. “We just won’t have access to them. That’s unfortunate.”\n\nAmerican-made versions are four times as expensive, he said, and “half as good.”\n\nBut the announcement was cause for celebration for the fledgling American drone companies that pushed for such an opening.\n\n“This was a historic decision that will change everything for U.S. drone manufacturers,” said a statement from BRINC, a Seattle-based manufacturer that makes drones for public safety. “BRINC and our peer companies are ready to meet the call for service to rebuild the American drone industry.”\n\nAnother company that hopes to fill the void left by DJI is Skydio, a U.S. drone company that hired Joe Bartlett, Ms. Stefanik’s former national security adviser, as its director of federal policy. Mr. Bartlett is now the deputy under secretary in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, which played a role in determining DJI’s fate. Skydio declined to comment.\n\nUnusual Machines, a Florida manufacturer of drone components, also stands to benefit from the decision. In a statement to The New York Times on Monday, its chief executive, Allan Evans, said the decision meant domestic manufacturers “have both an opportunity and a responsibility to build and deliver world-class products as quickly as possible.” Donald Trump Jr. sits on his advisory board.\n\nThe F.C.C. statement made clear that the decision does not affect drone pilots’ ability to fly the drones they already have or previously approved models.\n\n“There will be a window for American companies to catch up,” Mr. Bartels said. “I sure hope that they do.”",

    "fullText": "Russia has sent the cavalry to the front line in its latest low-tech attempt to claim land in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.\n\nVideo footage shared by Ukraine’s 92nd Brigade shows drones hunting down Russian soldiers as they race through an open field on horseback.\n\nIn the clip, a Russian soldier is seen riding as a drone tracks his movement. Moments later, the drone strikes, hitting the soldier as he attempts to escape. The explosion spooks another horse, which unseats its rider before making a charge in another direction. A third rider is seen, but his fate is unknown.\n\n“Russian occupiers lose so much equipment during their ‘meat-grinder assaults’ that they’re forced to move on horseback,” the 92nd Brigade wrote in a post accompanying the footage.\n\nVladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has been defined by rapid technological advances on the front lines, in particular in drone warfare. Small, off-the-shelf explosive drones have proved effective at defending against mechanised units and infantry.\n\nRussia recently introduced motorbikes and all-terrain vehicles as a way to speed across open countryside monitored by drones.\n\nHorses could offer yet more flexibility – agile on off-road terrain and less likely to trigger modern landmines equipped with magnetic sensors. The first horse-mounted casualty was reported by observers of the war in Ukraine in October.\n\nAt the same time, The Telegraph reported that the Storm unit of Russia’s 9th Brigade of the 51st Army had been preparing horse-mounted assault teams to operate in the Donetsk region.\n\nBefore this, there had been numerous reports of Russia utilising donkeys, horses and even camels to transport ammunition and other heavy equipment to the front line through muddy conditions not suitable for regular vehicles.\n\nThroughout the ages, horseback cavalry charges have provided speed, shock and flexibility on the battlefield.\n\nTanks and other heavily-armoured fighting machines are rarely seen on the battlefields of Ukraine and, when they do appear, they are almost instantly disabled by a wave of drones.\n\nRussia’s Kommersant newspaper said of the return of cavalry: “In armed conflicts that have become arenas for showcasing technological innovations, participants are once again forced to rely on basic tools – from analogue telephone lines to pack animals and carts – when modern technologies prove vulnerable.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Romney is worth an estimated $254 million, and was among Congress's wealthiest members.",
    "fullText": "Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. senator from Utah, has long been known for fiscal conservatism and tax cuts. But in a Friday op-ed for The New York Times, he reversed course, calling for higher taxes on rich Americans like himself to address the looming national debt crisis and prevent the collapse of Social Security.\n\nRomney said the U.S. is headed for an economic cliff as the Social Security Trust Fund races toward insolvency in 2034, according to a projection from the CRFB. Without congressional intervention, benefits would be slashed by roughly 23%, forcing the government to borrow trillions at potentially exorbitant interest rates or print money that could trigger hyperinflation.​\n\n“Today, all of us, including our grandmas, truly are headed for a cliff,” he warned. “Typically, Democrats insist on higher taxes, and Republicans insist on lower spending. But given the magnitude of our national debt as well as the proximity of the cliff, both are necessary.”​\n\nAmerica’s national debt has swelled to more than $38 trillion; in 2025 alone, it increased by about $1.8 trillion. Last year, interest payments on the debt surpassed $1 trillion for the first time, exceeding spending on Medicare and national defense. Annual debt-servicing costs are projected to climb to $1.8 trillion over the next decade.\n\n​”DOGE took a slash-and-burn approach to budget cutting and failed spectacularly,” Romney wrote. Indeed, a Yale University Budget Lab report earlier this year said DOGE was likely costing the government more than it was saving.\n\nRomney devoted most of his op-ed to tax proposals aimed at high earners. He reversed his longstanding opposition to raising the income cap on payroll taxes, which currently stands at $176,100.\n\n“I long opposed increasing the income level on which FICA employment taxes are applied (this year, the cap is $176,100). No longer; the consequences of the cliff have changed my mind,” he explained.​\n\nThe 78-year-old former presidential candidate also called for closing what he described as tax “caverns” or “caves” that benefit multibillionaires. He singled out the step-up in basis provision, which allows heirs of large estates to avoid capital gains taxes on inherited assets. Using Tesla CEO Elon Musk as an example, Romney argued this loophole should be eliminated for estates valued above $100 million.\n\n“If he had originally purchased his Tesla stock with, say, $1 billion and held it until his death and if it was then worth $500 billion, he would never pay the 24% federal capital gains tax on the $499 billion profit,” he said. “Why? Because under the tax code, capital gains are not taxed at death. The tax code provision known as step-up in basis means that when Mr. Musk’s heirs get his stock, they are treated as if they purchased it for $500 billion. So no one pays taxes on the $499 billion capital gain. Ever.”",

    "description": "A pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in Lexington, Nebraska.  Hundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.  “Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University.",
    "fullText": "LEXINGTON, Neb. (AP) — On a frigid day after Mass at St. Ann’s Catholic Church in rural Nebraska, worshippers shuffled into the basement and sat on folding chairs, their faces barely masking the fear gripping their town.\n\nA pall hung over the room just as it hung over the holiday season in Lexington, Nebraska.\n\n“Suddenly they tell us that there’s no more work. Your world closes in on you,” said Alejandra Gutierrez.\n\nShe and the others work at Tyson Foods' beef plant and are among the 3,200 people who will lose their jobs when Lexington's biggest employer closes the plant next month after more than two decades of operation.\n\nHundreds of families may be forced to pack up and leave the town of 11,000, heading east to Omaha or Iowa, or south to the meatpacking towns of Kansas or beyond, causing spinoff layoffs in Lexington's restaurants, barbershops, grocers, convenience stores and taco trucks.\n\n“Losing 3,000 jobs in a city of 10,000 to 12,000 people is as big a closing event as we’ve seen virtually for decades,” said Michael Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Indiana's Ball State University. It will be “close to the poster child for hard times.”\n\nAll told, the job losses are expected to reach 7,000, largely in Lexington and the surrounding counties, according to estimates from University of Nebraska, Lincoln, shared with The Associated Press. Tyson employees alone will lose an estimated $241 million in pay and benefits annually.\n\nTyson says it's closing the plant to “right-size” its beef business after a historically low cattle herd in the U.S. and the company’s expected loss of $600 million on beef production next fiscal year.\n\nThe plant's closure threatens to unravel a Great Plains town where the American Dream was still attainable, where immigrants who didn't speak English and never graduated high school bought homes, raised children in a safe community and sent them to college.\n\nNow, those symbols of economic progress — mortgages and car payments, property taxes and tuition costs — are bills that thousands of Tyson workers won't have an income to pay.\n\nAt St. Ann's church, Gutierrez sat between her daughters and recalled being told of the plant closure just before Thanksgiving while she visited a college campus with her high school senior, Kimberly.\n\n“At that moment, my daughter said she no longer wanted to study,” Gutierrez said. “Because where would we get the money to pay for college?”\n\nA tear slipped down Kimberly's cheek as she looked at her mother and then down at her hands.\n\nIf you threw a dart at a map of the United States, Lexington — called “Lex” by locals — would be just about bullseye.\n\nIt's easy to miss driving down Interstate 80, half hidden by barren hackberry trees, corn fields and pastures of Black Angus cattle, but a driver can spy the plant's hulking industrial buildings pumping steam.\n\nThe plant opened in 1990 and was bought by Tyson 11 years later, attracting thousands of workers and nearly doubling the town's population within a decade.\n\nMany came from Los Angeles, then stricken by recession, including Lizeth Yanes, who initially hated what she called “a little ghost town.\"\n\nBut soon Lexington flourished, with suburbs sprouting among bur oak and American elm trees. The downtown, a strip of cobblestone streets and brick buildings, has a Somali grocer that abuts a Hispanic bakery; locals attend over a dozen churches and several city recreation centers.\n\nTo this day, the plant creates the town's rhythm as workers roll on and off the daily A, B and C shifts and fill restaurants, school pickup lines and the one-screen movie theater showing “Polar Express.”\n\n“It took a long time for me to actually enjoy this little place,” said Yanes. “Now that I enjoy it, now I have to leave.”\n\nThe atmosphere inside the Tyson plant, where workers process as many as 5,000 head of cattle a day, laboring on slaughter floors, cleaning crews or trimming cuts of meat, feels “like a funeral,” she said.\n\n“Tyson was our motherland,\" said plant worker Arab Adan. The Kenyan immigrant sat in his car with his two energetic sons, who asked him a question he has no answer to: “Which state are we gonna go, daddy?”\n\nThe only thing Adan is set on is that his kids finish the school year in Lexington, where school officials say nearly half of students have a parent working for Tyson.\n\nThe school district, where at least 20 languages and dialects are spoken, has higher high school graduation and college attendance rates than the state and national average, and one of Nebraska's biggest marching bands. Residents are proud of the diversity and the tightknit community, where young people return to raise families.\n\nDuring Mass at St. Ann's, parishioners gave the cash in their pockets to a fund for families in financial need, despite knowing they'll be out of work next month. Afterward, Francisco Antonio ran through his future employment options with a sad smile.\n\nAfter the plant closes on Jan. 20, the 52-year-old father of four said he'll stay a few months in Lexington and look for work, though “now there's no future.\" He took off his glasses, paused, apologized and tried to explain his emotions.\n\n“It’s home mostly, not the job,” he said, replacing his glasses with an embarrassed smile.\n\n“We need another opportunity, job, here in Lex,” he said. “Otherwise Lex is gonna disappear.”\n\nThe domino effect could go something like this: If 1,000 families skip town, said economist Hicks — who wouldn't be surprised if it were double that — seats would be left empty in schools, leading to teacher layoffs; there would be far fewer customers in restaurants, shops and other businesses.\n\nMost of the customers at Los Jalapenos, a Mexican restaurant down the street from the plant, are Tyson workers. They fill booths after work and are greeted by owner Armando Martinez’s mustachioed grin and bellow of “Hola, amigo!”\n\nMartinez’s grandson once told his grandfather that when he grows up he wants to work at Tyson. The child's fifth-grade sister recently gathered with classmates to talk about the changes happening with their parents. Some were headed to California, others to Kansas. All were in tears.\n\nIf he can't keep up with bills, the restaurant will close, but “there’s just nowhere we can go,\" said Martinez, who undergoes dialysis for diabetes, has an amputated foot and prays for a miracle: that Tyson will change its mind.\n\nHe knows it's unlikely. Asked by The Associated Press for comment about plans for the site, Tyson said in a statement that it “is currently assessing how we can repurpose the facility within our own production network.” It did not provide details, or say whether it plans to offer support to the community through the plant closure.\n\nMany, including City Manager Joe Pepplitsch, are hoping Tyson puts the plant up for sale and a new company comes in bringing jobs. That isn't a quick fix, requiring time, negotiations, renovations and no guarantee of comparable jobs.\n\n“Tyson owes this community a debt. I think they have a responsibility here to help ease some of the impact,” he said, noting Tyson doesn't pay city taxes due to a deal negotiated decades ago.\n\n‘It’s not easy, at our age, to go back and start over’\n\nNear the plant, at the Dawson County Fairgrounds, Tyson workers recently filled a long hall as state agencies — responding with the urgency of a natural disaster — offered information on retraining, writing a resume, filing for unemployment and avoiding scammers when selling homes.\n\nAttendees' faces were subdued, like listening to a doctor’s prognosis. “Your financial health is going to change,\" they were told. “Don’t ignore the bank, they will not go away.”\n\nMany of the older workers don’t speak English, haven’t graduated high school and aren’t computer savvy. The last application some filled out was decades ago.\n\n“We know only working in meat for Tyson, we don’t have any other experience,” said Adan, the Kenyan immigrant.\n\nBack at St. Ann's, workers echoed that concern.\n\n“They only want young people now,” said Juventino Castro, who's worked at Tyson for a quarter-century. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the time I have left.”\n\nLupe Ceja said she's saved a little money, but it won’t last long. Luz Alvidrez has a cleaning gig that will sustain her for awhile. Others might return to Mexico for a time. Nobody has a clear plan.\n\n“It won’t be easy,” said Fernando Sanchez, a Tyson worker for 35 years who sat with his wife. “We started here from scratch and it’s time to start from scratch again.\"\n\nTears rolled down his wife's cheeks and he squeezed her hand.",

    "fullText": "When they were built, these lavish homes bore ornate examples of their owners' wealth, from towering turrets to marble archways.\n\nEach of these properties — once worth millions — has faced misfortune, such as the financial ruin of their owners or failed preservation efforts.\n\nWhile some have been restored to resemble their former glory or have opened to visitors, others have been deemed too dangerous to visit and too costly to repair.\n\nHere are eight abandoned mansions around the world — and what happened to them.\n\nKatie Warren, Libertina Brandt, and Taylor Ardrey contributed to earlier versions of this story.\n\nBuilt in 1912 by railroad magnate James H. Dooley, the Swannanoa mansion in Lyndhurst, Virginia, is an Italian Renaissance-style villa overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nDooley built the mansion as a summer house for his wife. The villa was converted into a country club for a few years after the couple's deaths, but it was abandoned by 1932 as the Great Depression reached its peak, per the mansion's website.\n\nThe mansion was purchased by a couple and converted into a museum while they resided there. Since their deaths in 1988, the mansion has sat vacant.\n\nToday, the mansion is a local attraction and wedding venue, offering public tours once a month from May to November.\n\nLocal residents have raised concerns over the conditions of the estate, local News Leader newspaper reported in 2015. In 2024, Andy Florance, CEO of CoStar, purchased the nearby Swannanoa Golf and Country Club, with plans for preservation.\n\nThe Cambusnethan House in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, is one of the last remaining Gothic mansions in Scotland.\n\nBuilt in 1819, the mansion belonged to the Lockhart family of Castlehill and was built to replace an early 17th-century house that burned down in 1810, per Scotland's Buildings at Risk Register.\n\nIn the 1970s, the house was used for mock medieval banquets, but it was further damaged by fire in the 1980s.\n\nA group called \"Friends of Cambusnethan Priory\" was established in 2014 to try to save the building, which is categorized at a \"critical\" risk level by Scotland's Buildings at Risk Register, from any further deterioration.\n\nLynnewood Hall, a 110-room, century-old Gilded Age mansion located just outside Philadelphia, was designed by Horace Trumbauer in the late 1890s.\n\nWhen he built the mansion, industrialist Peter A. B. Widener intended to reside there alongside his two sons and their families.\n\nHowever, his son George Dunton Widener, alongside his wife, Eleanor Elkins, and their son, Harry, were passengers on the Titanic when it sank. Only Eleanor survived.\n\nThe mansion was inherited by Peter's surviving son, Joseph, who died in 1943. Various owners acquired the property after that, including the First Korean Church of New York, which listed the property for sale in 2014.\n\nThe mansion remained vacant for years after.\n\nThe mansion, which cost about $325 million in today's currency when it was built in 1897, was documented as being in a dilapidated state, and repairs were estimated to cost up to $40 million in 2012.\n\nIn June 2023, the mansion was purchased for $9 million (or about $9.6 million in 2025 currency, adjusted for inflation) by the Lynnewood Hall Preservation Foundation, which aims to restore it to its former glory.\n\nPidhirtsi Castle in the Lviv region of Ukraine was built as a leisure home for a high-ranking Polish military commander between 1635 and 1640 by Italian architect Andrea dell'Aqua, per the World Monuments Fund.\n\nThe mansion prospered for years, but in the 19th century, new owners took over and neglected the castle, so that by the end of World War II, it had significantly deteriorated.\n\nPidhirtsi Castle has been damaged by fire and flooding over the years.\n\nPreservation efforts have enabled the restoration of part of the mansion, which has also hosted events such as exhibitions and concerts in recent years.\n\nThe McNeal mansion, situated along the Delaware River in New Jersey, was constructed by industrialist Andrew McNeal in 1890, following his establishment of a pipe plant and foundry.\n\nUS Pipe bought the property in 1899 and used it as its headquarters until 1953. In the subsequent decades, it was abandoned.\n\nToday, the mansion is collapsing in on itself, posing a danger to the urban explorers who visit.\n\nThe Villa de Vecchi, known as the \"Ghost Mansion\" of Italy, was built between 1854 and 1857. It was meant to be the summer home of a Count named Felix De Vecchi, who was head of the Italian National Guard. The home had all the modern amenities of the time, including indoor heating pipes and a large pressurized fountain.\n\nA 2002 landslide destroyed nearby homes, but the once-lavish and now-battered \"Ghost Mansion\" remained standing.\n\nSitting just outside Camdenton, Missouri, the ruins of Ha Ha Tonka resemble an ancient European castle. The mansion was built by Kansas City businessman Robert Snyder at the turn of the century.\n\nSnyder started building in 1905, but he never saw the house finished as he died in a car crash the following year. His sons took over the construction and lived there until the family ran out of money due to the several lawsuits surrounding the castle's property.\n\nIn 1942, parts of the castle burned down and sat abandoned until the state of Missouri bought the property for use as a state park in 1978.\n\nBuilt by Scottish entrepreneur Francis Bannerman VI in 1901, the Bannerman Castle sits on Pollepel Island in New York's Hudson River.\n\nRather than living in the castle, Bannerman used it as storage for his business's military weapons arsenal.\n\nAfter the powder house exploded in 1920, the upkeep of the castle dwindled. It was eventually acquired by the Hudson Highlands State Park Reserve.\n\nIn 1992, the Bannerman Castle Trust was established to repair the ruins. Since then, it has raised over $1 million to refurbish the castle, which is now open to the public for tours.\n\nDuring her 2019 visit, Business Insider's Joey Hadden said visitors were told to stay at least 100 feet away from the castle due to its deterioration. Still, it was worth the visit.\n\n\"The combination of medieval architecture and overgrown trees and foliage makes Bannerman Castle a sight worth visiting up close,\" she wrote.",

    "description": "Would you double your salary for a fully in-person job? A TikTok video has sparked a debate — tell us which you'd choose by taking our poll.",
    "fullText": "What's better: $120,000 for a remote job or $240,000 in the office?\n\nThat question was first posed to the creator Tinx, who recounted it in a viral TikTok. The post now has over 5 million views, and a comments section of over 18,000 people debating RTOs and perks.\n\nRemote work remains a flash point for workplace debate. Instagram ordered five days in office starting in February, and TikTok has a five-day RTO coming down soon, too. Other companies advertise their remote-first status in an effort to attract top talent.\n\nTinx made her stance clear: take the extra money.\n\n\"What do you guys think goes on at the office?\" she asked. \"It's not that scary.\"\n\nSome popular comments disagree. \"$120k remote any day. My mental health is more important,\" reads one comment.\n\n\"The office is THAT bad,\" another reads.\n\nThe video also led to a load of spin-off TikToks, where creators make their case for one job or another.\n\n\"Be serious,\" creator Toni Childs said. \"That's a $70,000 difference after taxes. That's what you're giving up.\"\n\nTikToker Rai Tryna also said to accept the $240,00: \"You can put yourself so far ahead, just by working at that job a couple more years.\"\n\n$120k vs $240k FOR THE SAME JOB? Y’all gotta be lying #fyp #remotework #corporate\n\nMcKenzie Mark said that she would take the $120,000 remote role. Mark said she works in tech as a fully remote employee making $118,000, and has gotten offers that would bring her pay to $250,000.\n\n\"Working remote is not something I'm willing to compromise on,\" Mark said. \"I was able to fully sell my car and become a one-car household with my partner, who also works remote.\"\n\nI would rather work remote for $120,000 than be in an office full-time for $240,000 🫢💸💻 #remote #wfh #workfromhome #returntooffice #corporate\n\nChanelle Howell agreed: \"You'd have to pay me so much more money than 240 to be in-office five days a week.\"\n\nThe debate also migrated to X. When Lindsay Stamp posted about it, her comments were flooded with opposing takes. \"Take that extra money and buy your freedom in half the time,\" wrote one commenter. \"Yep. Remote,\" wrote another.\n\nFor parents, remote work may also be more highly valued for the flexibility it brings for childcare duties. One creator said that choosing the $120,000 option should only apply to those who \"two or more kids under the age of four.\"\n\n\"If i was single, I'd take the 240,\" Kaylin Patschke commented on Tinx's video. \"As a working mom, i'd take the 120.\"\n\nIn her original TikTok, Tinx also said that she could immediately guess the questioner's age: Gen Z. The office may do the generation some good, she said.\n\n\"It'll make you all less weird,\" Tinx said.\n\nGen Z's social awkwardness has long been a topic of debate on the internet. In July, the \"Gen Z Stare\" went viral on TikTok, showcasing the wide-eyed look some young people give in public when responding to basic small talk.\n\nIs Gen Z really that against in-office work? It depends on who you ask.\n\nSome Gen Zers are gravitating toward remote jobs, such as customer service, with their promise of a better work-life balance. Business Insider's Juliana Kaplan, who is a member of Gen Z herself, wrote that she found the pre-pandemic 9-to-5 job \"soul-crushing.\"\n\nBut many are actually desperate to get to their cubicle. Gen Z workers from Goldman Sachs and Google told Business Insider that they wanted to work in person. Some young people have gone back to the office, only to find their managers working remotely. And, who knows — they might even fall in love in the office.",

    "fullText": "Chris Mooney is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and a CNN Climate contributor. He is currently a professor of practice in the Environmental Institute at the University of Virginia.\n\nBathtubs and pools mislead us about the ocean: Its surface is anything but flat.\n\nSeas pile up in some spots, pushed by trade winds or pulled by gravity toward big things like ice sheets. Amid it all, at the western end of large ocean basins, the fastest surface currents — veins of warm water — race toward the poles, causing additional slopes at the surface.\n\nThe ocean is uneven to begin with, and its unevenness is also changing. Maps of recent changes show intricate patterns of watery hills and valleys, but also call attention to one extraordinary location. Off the coast of Japan, one region of the ocean has been rising by nearly an inch every year, right next to another where it has been falling even faster.\n\nIt’s the fingerprint of one of those surface currents changing its location, an event that has had dramatic repercussions. The Kuroshio, or “Black Current,” is one of the largest streams of water anywhere in the world, and its recent movement has triggered record-warm ocean temperatures and upended fisheries, an indelible staple of Japanese culture. Scientists say the warm waters have even amplified heatwaves on land and driven extreme rainfall.\n\nAnd while there are signs some of the changes are now waning, fishing communities say they aren’t yet back to normal. Meanwhile, scientists worry it could be a sign of more volatility to come.\n\nThe position of the current could keep fluctuating, said Bo Qiu, a leading Kuroshio expert at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. “It’s hard to predict the future, but given the data we have so far, I can only see the intensity becoming larger and larger,” he said.\n\nThe deep, warm Kuroshio transports more than 200 times as much water as the Amazon River, traveling north from the equator and normally banking east around Japan’s Boso peninsula, near Tokyo. Here, it becomes known as the Kuroshio Extension as it heads into the open Pacific.\n\nBut in recent years, the current has been behaving in anything but the usual way, and the Extension, in particular, made a major divergence along Japan’s coast. Its northern edge shifted as much as 300 miles farther poleward, leading to unprecedented warm waters in the surrounding region.\n\n“I was so surprised I don’t even know if ‘surprised’ is the right word,” said Shusaku Sugimoto, an associate professor at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan, a northern coastal city.\n\nSugimoto led a study analyzing ocean temperatures off the coast in locations the Extension didn’t historically reach, but has in recent years. “The fact that the temperature rose 6 degrees (Celsius) off the Sanriku coast, and the elevated temperature persisted for two years, represents a level of water temperature rise we’ve never seen before,” he said.\n\nIn August of 2017, the Kuroshio current south of Japan settled into a “large meander” pattern, leaving the coastline and looping southward, taking its warm waters with it. This big shift in water temperatures south of Japan changes the distributions of fish species offshore.\n\nLarge meanders themselves are a well-known recurring feature of the current, explained Shinichiro Kida, an oceanographer at Kyushu University. Records of these events date back to the 1960s. During a lengthy meander event from 1975 to 1980, scientists saw a severe decline in anchovy in the Enshunada Sea, a major fishing region to the south of Japan’s main island of Honshu. The anchovy were replaced by sardines, which favor the warmer water the current brought to the region.\n\nBut no Kuroshio large meander that we know of has lasted as long as this one. In August, the Japan Meteorological Agency finally declared that it had ended after nearly eight years. But overall both changes have had a big effect on this country that is home to more than 100 million.\n\nThe meander and the Extension shift are connected, Qiu said. He co-authored a new paper in the Journal of Climate arguing as much, and calling the configuration a “new dynamic regime.”\n\n“I’ve been working on the Kuroshio Extension for more than three decades,” Qiu said. “I never expected this.”\n\nAs the Kuroshio powers along, it not only brings warmer water but also, depending on its location, higher sea level. There can be a several-foot difference between ocean heights on different sides of the current, thanks to its warmth and speed .\n\nBut because of these factors, any new movement of the current can have dramatic effects.\n\nThe large meander, for example, triggered a sea level fall in one region and pronounced sea level rise — by as much as half a foot — along the coast of the island of Honshu south of Tokyo. In October of 2017, when Typhoon Lan struck the Shizuoka Prefecture along this coastline, the higher sea level amplified the damage, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.\n\nIt is not only the height of the sea: As the Kuroshio is a warm current, and one traveling northward into cooler waters, its arrival in a new location has enormous effects on ocean temperatures.\n\nThe big question is how much the recent phenomena are part of a natural cycle, and how much it’s influenced by something else, like climate change. (And how much it’s both, combined.)\n\nThe impact of climate change on the large meander is unclear, because of its long history. But as far as the Extension shift goes, there are mounting reasons to implicate greenhouse gases and a changing climate.\n\nTo understand the recent changes in the Kuroshio is to understand how water moves through the world’s oceans, especially the large rotating “gyres” found in the world’s major ocean basins.\n\nFive of these basins — North and South Pacific, North and South Atlantic, and Indian — feature a similar pattern. Warm water travels west along the equator, then turns toward the poles. The currents carrying the warm water north or south on poleward transits are called “western boundary currents,” and they include the Kuroshio and its four famed cousins: the Gulf Stream, the Brazil, the East Australian, and the Agulhas.\n\nScientists are now seeing most of these currents changing in a similar way — getting warmer and pushing even farther poleward.\n\nThis change is rooted in a phenomenon known as the Hadley Cell, a global zone of warm, rising air across the tropics. It’s now expanding due to climate change.\n\n“This expansion shifts not just rainfall patterns but also the zones of sinking air that anchor high-pressure systems, such as the Pacific High,” explains Brown University climate scientist Emanuele Di Lorenzo.\n\nIn the middle latitudes, these massive high-pressure systems are the driving force behind currents like the Kuroshio. So, when the winds move, the currents do too.\n\nBoth models and data suggest the Kuroshio Extension, in particular, has been moving north partly because of the atmospheric shift, Di Lorenzo explained.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2021, driven by wind changes, the northern edge of the Kuroshio Extension shifted north by about 130 miles, a recent study found. This was before an even larger shift in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe Kuroshio Extension’s leap in 2023 and 2024 was an extreme event. The northern edge reached nearly to the northern tip of Honshu, Japan’s largest island. In a different study, Sugimoto and colleagues with the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Meteorological Research Institute took oceanographic measurements in the Extension’s new location. They found water as much as 18 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual, extending to a depth of around 400 meters, or 1,300 feet.\n\nThe authors note that for an entire year and a half between April 2023 and August 2024, the region saw “intense marine heatwave conditions almost every day.”\n\nAnd it was not just in the water: the Japan Meteorological Agency also found that the extreme ocean conditions contributed to record summer heat over land in northern Japan in 2023. Another group of scientists, meanwhile, linked the warm offshore current to extreme rainfall over Japan’s Chiba Prefecture, near Tokyo, in September of 2023.\n\nThese ocean changes have altered the distributions of fish populations along Japan’s Pacific Coast, creating extreme impacts on Japan’s iconic fisheries.\n\nIn central Japan, for instance, a major mackerel fishery was upended, and fishers say that even though the large meander has now ended, that doesn’t mean things can instantly go back to the way they were.\n\n“Immediate recovery is not a reality, and while conditions may gradually improve, at present, there has been no recovery in catches,” said Osamu Nagai, executive director of the Mie Gaiwan (Outer Bay) Fisheries Cooperative Association.\n\n“The catch has fallen to less than half of what it was 10 years ago — we’re now only catching about 20 to 30 percent of the mackerel. This is a major blow,” Nagai said.\n\nNortheastern Japan’s Sanriku coast, known for its rich fisheries, is a different story, but still a bad one. Here, the southward flowing Oyashio current traditionally brings down cool waters and supports rich fisheries. But when the Kuroshio Extension moved northward into this region, it displaced the Oyashio, bringing on a stark change in ocean temperature.\n\nAnd it is not just fish species, like Pacific salmon and saury, that became harder to catch.\n\n“What matters most is the foundation of Japan’s most important food culture, which is the flavor made out of Kombu seaweed — it can only be harvested in Hokkaido, near Japan,” said Yoshihiro Tachibana, a professor who specializes in climate dynamics at Mie University.\n\n“Kombu stocks are declining dramatically. Dashi (the fundamental Japanese soup stock) culture might collapse. It’s declining. We can’t get any at all. So I believe this has a tremendous impact on our food culture as well,” he said.\n\nRecently, the northern edge of the Kuroshio extension has retreated a bit. It has moved back to around 37 degrees North Latitude, according to Qiu. That’s still a high location historically, but hardly as extreme as before.\n\nBut the questions remain: what do these extreme ocean events mean, how they are linked to climate change? For at least one researcher, they’re an early sign of things to come.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity to learn what the oceans will be like 100 years from now,” said Sugimoto, of Tohoku University in the northeastern region of Honshu, Japan’s largest island.\n\n“An unprecedented ocean phenomenon is now occurring by chance in Tohoku,” he continued. “Understanding how this has altered the seas of Tohoku offers a chance to understand how the world’s oceans will change in the future.”\n\nElisabeth Doty contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "When the chill sets in and you find yourself swapping lightweight sweaters and trench coats for bulky jackets, don't forget to give your fragrance shelf a seasonal refresh, too.\n\nWinter fragrances often lean richer, warmer, and more enveloping — think amber, spice, woods, and heady florals that wrap around you like a cozy, knitted blanket.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three perfumers about which scents they love for winter and why. From narcotic florals to warm ambers, here's what they said about their seasonal favorites.\n\nAmber fragrances provide some coziness in cold weather.\n\nDana Schmitt, New York City-based perfumer at the fragrance company Givaudan, said that one of her longtime favorites is Chanel Coromandel, a soft yet luxurious scent. It's a plush, amber perfume anchored by patchouli and frankincense.\n\nAnother staple she recommends is REPLICA's Jazz Club, a classic scent built on rich, spicy, and woody notes.\n\nIt evokes the feeling of settling into a dim jazz lounge on a chilly winter night in the city — making it perfect for a romantic date night.\n\nGourmands — including vanilla, caramel, and honey — are just so cozy for winter, bringing warmth and comfort when the temperatures drop.\n\nBryson Ammons, New York City-based perfumer and founder of The Alloy Studio, likes to push the category a bit further by incorporating a bit of spice.\n\nHe really enjoys Amphora Parfum Honeycakes, a sweet yet savory scent that feels both nostalgic and surprising. \"It's like a spiced coffee — a very sticky, syrupy fragrance,\" he said.\n\nFor something more amber-forward but still gourmand, Schmitt points to Mugler Angel Eau de Parfum, a sweet, praline scent that also features signature notes of patchouli and bergamot.\n\nWinters can be cold. When it's under 30 degrees, New York City-based independent perfumer Asia Grant likes leaning into narcotic, smooth fragrances that feel like wrapping yourself in cashmere and tucking into a dim, cozy library.\n\nRich musks and heady florals really come alive in cold weather, and also add a brooding, dark-academia vibe that pairs well with chunky sweaters and penny loafers.\n\nGrant recommends Dominique Ropion's Carnal Flower, an intoxicating, full-bodied fragrance that features notes of melon, tuberose, and white musk.\n\nBecause it's so highly concentrated, she often likes layering it with lighter, fresher scents to balance it out.\n\nLemons, oranges, limes, and grapefruits might make you think \"summer,\" but they're technically winter-blooming fruits, which makes them a natural fit for cold-weather fragrances, said Ammons.\n\nThey also add a bit of brightness and zing to the chillier months.\n\nAlthough spicy and ambery scents are a given for winter, Ammons likes to shake things up with fresh, woodsy one. Think: light florals, clean laundry, freshly-fallen snow, and a wisp of smoke.\n\nOne of his go-tos is Aesop's Rozu Eau De Parfum, which pairs notes of rose and bergamot with sandalwood and musk.\n\n\"There's something clean and kind of chic about it,\" Ammons said.",

    "description": "For more than a month, the Bay Area has been subjected to a seemingly ceaseless stampede of earthquakes, rattling windows and raising fears across California.",
    "fullText": "For more than a month, the Bay Area has been subjected to a seemingly ceaseless stampede of earthquakes — the latest in a series of seismic swarms that have rattled windows and raised fears across California.\n\nThe latest swarm has been centered in the East Bay suburb of San Ramon, where a magnitude 4 earthquake struck Friday night — the largest since the cluster began — and a magnitude 3.9 on Saturday night. Since Nov. 9, there have been at least 80 earthquakes of magnitude 2 or greater in the area, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nWhile none of these quakes has been particularly potent — which was also the case in similar swarms recorded in Malibu, El Sereno and Ontario since 2024 — some fear the persistent seismic activity could foreshadow a back-of-mind concern for many Californians: the \"Big One.\"\n\nBut while experts acknowledge that some major earthquakes are preceded by more-modest temblors, they caution that the swarms by themselves probably don't offer a hint of when, or where, the next major quake will hit.\n\n\"There's gonna be a big earthquake in the Bay Area. We just can't say exactly when and where. So you should be prepared for that,\" said Annemarie Baltay, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist.\n\nThe threat of a large earthquake always looms in California regardless of the appearance of small shakers. There is a 60% chance of an earthquake of magnitude 6.7 or greater in the Los Angeles region by 2043, and a 72% chance of the same in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to 30-year estimates calculated by USGS in 2014.\n\nAcross California, there's also a 48% chance of a magnitude 7.5 quake or greater by 2043, and a 7% chance of a magnitude 8 or greater quake.\n\nIt is true that after every earthquake, there's a 1-in-20 chance it'll be followed by a larger magnitude temblor. But conventionally, only half of earthquakes have an easily detectable foreshock, while the other half do not.\n\nSouthern California has provided some recent examples of swarms that ultimately fizzled out. The Malibu area had a trio of scary earthquakes recently — a magnitude 4.6 earthquake on Feb. 9, 2024; a magnitude 4.7 on Sept. 12, 2024; and a magnitude 4.1 on March 9. But it has been quieter in the last six months.\n\nOntario endured a spate of shaking a little more than a year ago, topping out with a magnitude 4 quake on Oct. 6, 2024. But there have been fewer, much smaller quakes so far this year.\n\nAn earthquake swarm centered around El Sereno in Eastside Los Angeles also was detected last year, though that activity appears to have subsided following a magnitude 4.4 earthquake on Aug. 12, 2024.\n\nThe cluster of small San Ramon earthquakes in recent weeks is also not terribly unusual. The earthquakes are appearing on the northern end of the Calaveras fault as it runs into Mount Diablo.\n\nIncluding the current swarm and another last month, there have been nine earthquake swarms in the surrounding area since 1970. They have lasted anywhere from two to 42 days, with maximum magnitudes generally in the 3 to 4 range, according to Baltay.\n\n\"This is still really consistent with these kinds of swarms,\" Baltay said of the current activity.\n\nCertainly, for residents who feel the frequent small earthquakes, \"it's really unsettling ... you don't know when it's going to end,\" she said.\n\nNone of those earlier swarms resulted in a major quake on the northern section of the Calaveras fault, which hasn't ruptured catastrophically in modern history.\n\nStill, the Calaveras fault is one to watch for California. It's considered one of the most likely faults to rupture in a major quake for the Bay Area, and has the potential to trigger a magnitude 6.7 quake or greater. In 1984, a section of the Calaveras fault ruptured and caused the magnitude 6.2 Morgan Hill earthquake, which resulted in 21 minor injuries and $7.5 million in damage.\n\nAlso of concern are the Hayward fault and the notorious San Andreas fault, according to the USGS.\n\nThe smattering of small earthquakes in Southern California generated significant, not altogether unwarranted, attention last year.\n\nIn fact, 2024 ended up being a record of sorts for modest quakes in Southern California — there were 15 independent earthquake sequences that year with at least one magnitude 4 or higher earthquake, according to seismologist Lucy Jones. That was the highest total in 65 years, surpassing the 13 seen in 1988.\n\nBut last year's figure probably didn't mean much in the greater scheme of things. In 2025, there have been only five independent seismic sequences with at least one magnitude 4 or higher earthquake in Southern California.\n\nThat said, there have been situations when relatively modest quakes have preceded huge ones.\n\nIn 1857, a mammoth magnitude 7.8 earthquake ruptured along 225 miles of the San Andreas fault, stretching from Monterey County to Los Angeles County. That Big One hit at around 8:30 a.m. on Jan. 9, 1857, but it was preceded in Monterey County by a magnitude 5.6 earthquake an hour earlier, and a magnitude 6.1 earthquake an hour before that.\n\nAnd then there were the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquakes in the Mojave Desert. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake ruptured July 4 at 10:33 a.m., but that was followed by a much larger magnitude 7.1 earthquake at 8:19 p.m. the next day.\n\nThere were also a few harrowing months in 1992. A magnitude 6.1 Joshua Tree temblor on April 22 of that year made scientists nervous because its epicenter was only about 6 miles away from the San Andreas fault. After the Joshua Tree earthquake, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services issued an advisory for Southern California, warning people to be on alert for another, larger earthquake.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, \"nothing happened, but we kept on having all these aftershocks sitting there right near the San Andreas and making us uncomfortable and worrying about it,\" Jones said. The aftershocks eventually migrated north, away from the San Andreas.\n\nBut those aftershocks crept toward the eventual epicenter of a far more powerful earthquake in the Mojave Desert — the magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake of June 28, 1992. That quake resulted in aftershocks that also reactivated seismic activity around Joshua Tree.\n\n\"So we now had a continuous line of aftershocks coming all the way down to the San Andreas,\" Jones said.\n\nHours after the Landers earthquake, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck in Big Bear, \"which was on a different fault, but also the aftershocks to Big Bear extended down to the San Andreas in a different location,\" Jones said.\n\nThe result was so alarming to scientists and officials that the Governor's Office of Emergency Services issued what was then an unprecedented advisory urging people to stay off freeways, a call that came as freeway and bridge collapses from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake were still on the minds of many.\n\nNothing ended up happening on the San Andreas fault in 1992, however.\n\n\"It's probably the closest we've come to a prediction, ever,\" Jones said. \"We were really pretty nervous about it.\"\n\nHowever, there have been other major earthquakes with no easily noticeable foreshocks, Jones said. Those include some of the most destructive in recent memory, such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake and the 1971 Sylmar earthquake.\n\nA.

    "fullText": "Corporate wellness may be in, but that doesn't seem to be stopping companies from splurging on champagne and steak this holiday season.\n\nTikTokers are giving the internet a glimpse into consulting and tech companies' holiday parties, from ice skating to raves.\n\nIt appears that some consulting firms consulted with the same venue — Deloitte and KPMG's parties both seem to take place at Le Grand Palais des Glaces, an indoor ice skating rink with a mock Eiffel Tower, according to videos on TikTok.\n\nKPMG confirmed that more than 3,000 people attended its party in Paris at Le Grand Palais des Glaces. None of the other companies responded to a request for comment from Business Insider, and the videos saying they're of the parties have not been verified.\n\nThe post about KPMG's party includes a figure skating performance, drinks, and oysters lying on a bed of ice. A post that said it was of Deloitte's event also featured a figure skating show, with a group of performers in yellow dresses, rather than the duet performance for KPMG employees. In terms of food, the apparent Deloitte bash offered bubbly, oysters, and a dish featuring truffle mushrooms, according to one video.\n\nA representative for KPMG said that the firm's New York City holiday party took place at The Overview, an event space in the Javits Center, and featured live music, a holiday menu, and photo stations. In San Fransico, the Cirque du Soleil-themed party was at the San Francisco Design Center.\n\nQuand ton cabinet décide d’organiser sa soirée de Noël au Grand Palais ❄️⛸️🤍 #christmas #party #deloitte #big4 #patinaje\n\nA video that said it showed a PWC bash in New York City features a disco ball, dance floor, full bar, strips of rare steak, and accessories befitting a typical middle school graduation party, like light-up shutter shades and necklaces. (The TikToker told Business Insider the video is not affiliated with their work at PWC.)\n\nSome of Elon Musk's companies also pulled out all the stops, according to social media. TikTok videos that said they showed SpaceX's holiday party included a rave around a Mars-themed stage — fitting since the rocket company aims to reach the red planet by 2026. There seemed to be carnival rides, sledding on fake snow, and performers dancing in cyber trucks.\n\nBoss threw a little holiday party for the team🚀 #spacex #holidayparty2025\n\nThe party appeared to take place in an outdoor arena, as some can be seen milling around largely empty bleachers in another video.\n\nxAI employees hung out with Optimus robots, according to posts on X.

    "description": "Ina Garten and her husband, Jeffrey, are celebrating their 57th wedding anniversary. Here's a timeline of their relationship.",
    "fullText": "Few celebrity love stories are as sweet as that of Ina Garten and her husband, Jeffrey.\n\nThe pair met while Ina was visiting her brother at Dartmouth College, where Jeffrey was a junior. After Jeffrey spotted her from the campus library window, he began writing her love letters — not before long, the pair were engaged and eventually married.\n\nIna and Jeffrey have been together ever since, despite being apart from one another due to Jeffrey's work and service in the Army, as well as a brief separation during the early years of their marriage.\n\n\"I think how crazy that was and how dangerous it was, but we wouldn't have the relationship we have now if I hadn't done it,\" Garten wrote in her memoir, \"Be Ready When the Luck Happens.\"\n\nHere's a timeline of their timeless relationship.\n\nTheir romance began to blossom after Jeffrey spotted Ina on campus from the library window.\n\n\"Look at that girl, isn't she beautiful?\" Jeffrey told his roommate at the time, Food Network reported. As it happened, Garten's roommate knew precisely who she was: Ina Rosenberg, the younger sister of a friend he had planned to go on a date with that night.\n\nAfter the date didn't lead anywhere, Jeffrey sent her a letter with his photo in it. The future cookbook author was immediately interested.\n\n\"He saw me on the street and then sent me a letter with a photograph of himself in it,\" she told People in 2018. \"I just remember running through the house and going, 'Mom, Mom, you've got to see this picture of this guy. He's so cute!'\"\n\nAfter Jeffrey picked up Ina, who was still in high school at the time, he drove them over to a bar in Port Chester, New York, where the legal drinking age was 18.\n\n\"It was a disaster,\" she told Food Network. \"I had never been to a bar in my life! The guy at the door says, 'Where's your ID?' and I thought, 'What ID?'\"\n\nThey ended up going to a coffee shop instead, where they had a \"perfectly good time,\" according to Jeffrey.\n\nAfter they were married, Ina and Jeffrey Garten settled in North Carolina after Jeffrey enlisted in the Army. With no plans to continue her studies at Syracuse University, Ina focused on cooking for her husband.\n\nHowever, Jeffrey pushed her to pursue her passions for business and cooking, and she ended up getting her pilot's certificate on the side.\n\n\"We were part of the first generation where there was a fork in the road for a lot of women, whether to pursue their careers or stay at home,\" Jeffrey told People in 2018. \"Ina was a cross between the two. She would send me brownies in a shoebox when I was in college and make me sweaters, but it never crossed my mind that she wouldn't also do something really interesting professionally.\"\n\n\"I wrote to Ina every single day,\" he told People in 2018 of his time stationed in Thailand. \"During the whole year, I was only able to call her once.\"\n\nIna saved all the letters and has spoken about reflecting on them 50 years after the pair tied the knot. One of Jeffrey's letters mentioned how he'd love to take her to Paris, despite not having enough money for a hotel.\n\nParis still holds a special place in the couple's hearts and is where they've spent their anniversary every year.\n\nUsing all the ingredients France had to offer, Ina prepared all their meals on a small gas camping stove.\n\n\"I had always thought about French food as 'cuisine' with complicated preparations and slowly simmered sauces,\" Garten wrote in her cookbook \"Cooking for Jeffrey,\" according to Bon Appétit. \"I discovered French street markets and simple, seasonal food that was based on incredibly good ingredients.\"\n\n\"It was the first formative period in her cooking,\" Jeffrey told Food Network. \"All those little shops in Europe — the boulangeries — Ina would walk through them and just glow.\"\n\nWhen they returned home, Ina began working her way through Julia Child's \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" in order to hone her skills.\n\nWhile in DC, Ina Garten spent her days earning her degree from Georgetown University and later working at the White House Office of Management and Budget. Jeffrey, meanwhile, worked in the State Department. At night, the Gartens entertained their throngs of friends at weekly dinner parties.\n\n\"People still talk about her parties,\" Jeffrey told Food Network. \"They were legendary.\"\n\nGarten worked under both Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, helping to write the nuclear energy budget.\n\nIna Garten and Jeffrey decided early on in their relationship not to have children.\n\n\"It was a choice I made very early,\" Garten said during an appearance on Katie Couric's podcast in 2017. \"We decided not to have children. I really appreciate that other people do and we will always have friends that have children that we are close to...\" Garten explained. \"I really felt, I feel, that I would have never been able to have the life I've had. So it's a choice and that was the choice I made.\"\n\n\"We don't have any children. I'm her family,\" Jeffrey told Johns Hopkins Magazine in 2016.\n\n\"When I told [Jeffrey] I wanted to move to New York and open a food store, he said, 'Let's move to New York!'\" Garten told People in 2018. \"That he would not object to moving to a different state for my career was so unusual, particularly 40 years ago.\"\n\nIt became her new passion project and would be the key to launching her to superstardom.\n\n\"Jeffrey said, 'If you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten told the New York Times' Sam Sifton during a virtual chat for the release of \"Modern Comfort Food.\" \"And that's the best advice anybody ever gave me.\"\n\nJeffrey also kept busy and worked his way to becoming the managing director at Lehman Brothers.\n\nThe pair briefly separated in the late 1970s as they navigated the pressures of Garten's new business venture.\n\nDuring that period, Jeffrey was working in Washington, DC, while Ina was building her own professional path with the Barefoot Contessa store.\n\n\"When I bought Barefoot Contessa, I shattered our traditional roles —­ took a baseball bat to them and left them in pieces,\" Garten wrote in her memoir, People reported. \"While I was still cooking, cleaning, shopping, managing at the store, I was doing it as a businesswoman, not a wife. My responsibilities made it impossible for me to even think about anything else.\"\n\nShe asked Jeffrey for a temporary separation while she figured out how to balance being both a businesswoman and a wife, and he came to terms with the fact that Garten had a flourishing career that would limit her time spent at home.\n\nThe separation was short-lived, and the couple ultimately reconciled.\n\nWhile Jeffrey was on business for Lehman Brothers in Tokyo, Garten did the same thing for his apartment there, even going so far as to hire a Japanese artist to replicate his desk chair.\n\nTheir Southport, Connecticut, home looks almost identical to how it did over 20 years ago, except for a few personal touches courtesy of Jeffrey.\n\n\"Ina doesn't like any evidence of her public life,\" he told Food Network, \"so I collect all the newspaper and magazine articles. The walls are covered with pictures of Ina.\"\n\nAs a first-time author, Garten was new to the publishing business and wasn't sure the book would be successful. However, her husband was always supportive.\n\n\"She has natural talent, but it's backed by so much effort and so much focus,\" he said. \"When she had the store, she'd work until midnight all the time. The discipline of her recipe testing and how seriously she takes it — she doesn't settle for anything but the best. She's like a runner who collapses at the finish line even though she was ahead the whole race.\"\n\nHer hard work paid off — the first initial 5,000 copies of \"The Barefoot Contessa Cookbook,\" plus an extra 15,000 the publisher ordered in advance because of strong press engagement, sold out almost immediately.\n\n\"We're always texting each other and calling,\" she told People. \"But I have to say I really look forward to Thursday or Friday when he comes home and the weekends are sacrosanct.\"\n\n\"When we're not together, I'll send her five or six texts per day,\" Jeffrey said. \"I love looking at her schedule. I can envision where she is and what she's doing, and it doesn't feel like we're apart. If I could be with her seven days a week, 24 hours a day, that would be my ideal.\"\n\n\"I feel like I prepared my whole life to be quarantined, or working towards a place where we could be quarantined,\" the Barefoot Contessa told People in September 2020. \"Jeffrey writes and he teaches remotely, and I think [he] is going to look back on these days as the good old days. I make him lunch, I make him dinner and he's home all the time.\"\n\n\"He would always leave on Monday and come back on Friday and I stayed in one place,\" Ina said. \"I always wondered what it was going to be like when he retired. And when this happened, I thought, oh, I guess that's what it's going to be like ... I have to say, it's great.\"\n\nIn February 2021, Garten revealed how she and Jeffrey found pockets of joy during lockdown.\n\n\"Lunch date! Jeffrey and I make PB&Js, drive down to the beach, sit in the car, and listen to the podcast The Daily,\" Ina Garten captioned an Instagram post of her and Jeffrey's lunch.\n\n\"Happy Birthday to the love of my life! I've loved you for more than 50 years, and I'm just getting started,\" she captioned a series of photos of the couple.\n\n\"Happy anniversary, babe. Marrying someone smart, funny, and adorable is always a good idea,\" Garten captioned a series of photos of the pair in an Instagram post.",

    "description": "Citi said it was overweight on info tech, healthcare, and financial stocks heading into the first quarter of 2026.",
    "fullText": "The investing playbook to follow in the new year homes in on three key sectors of the stock market, according to Citigroup.\n\nThe bank's investment research arm unveiled its list of sector calls heading into the first quarter of 2026, which included three areas it believes investors should be overweight in as the new year begins: Information technology, financials, and healthcare.\n\nBesides financials, those sectors have seen a stellar performance in 2025. The healthcare sector of the S&P 500 is up 17% for the year, while technology stocks are up 28% year-to-date, beating the benchmark index. The financials sector has lagged the broader market, up 6% since January.\n\n\"For most of '25, we led with a Growth cluster focus while frequently advocating a Cyclical barbell,\" the bank wrote of its portfolio based on its 2025 sector picks, which outperformed the S&P 500 by over four percentage points. \"Headed into '26, we focus on a better balance with Defensives. This is aligned with our expectations for fundamental broadening,\" it said of its outlook for the coming year.\n\nHere are Citi's areas of focus heading into the new year, followed by its top stock picks for each sector.\n\nThesis: Earnings growth among banks and financial services stocks appears to be holding strong heading into 2026.\n\nFor bank stocks in particular, profit margins look \"healthy,\" and the sector is flashing positive trading signals, Citi said. The bank pointed to the sector's positive Relative Strength Index reading, one gauge that measures whether an investment is overbought or oversold.\n\nThesis: The bank said it expects \"lessening policy overhang\" to boost investor sentiment across healthcare, referring to trends like uncertainty around drug pricing fading as more pharma companies make deals with the Trump administration.\n\n\"Revisions have turned positive and the growth outlook for '26 should begin to improve,\" the bank said of the healthcare equipment & services area in particular. \"Insiders have stepped up purchases while sells have declined off recent peak.\"\n\nThesis: Fundamentals across the information technology sector look strong, Citi researchers said, pointing to an \"attractive\" growth setup in the semiconductors space and positive earnings revisions in the software & services area.\n\n\"This is our preferred growth sector given good fundamental trends and revisions. Surprisingly, not all valuation reads are stretched,\" the bank wrote.",

    "description": "Trump's Department of Education completed its update to income-based repayment plans, expanding access to borrowers with higher incomes.",
    "fullText": "An affordable student-loan repayment plan is now available to more borrowers.\n\nOn December 22, President Donald Trump's Department of Education said that it had completed a key update to income-based repayment plans, removing the requirement to be in partial financial hardship to enroll.\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation included a provision to remove the financial hardship requirement, which meant that the borrower's monthly payment had to be less than the amount needed to pay off their full balance over a 10-year period.\n\nNow that the update is complete, borrowers with higher incomes should soon become eligible to enroll in IBR plans. The department said that it encourages borrowers who were previously denied from IBR plans due to a lack of partial financial hardship to reapply using the online income-driven repayment application.\n\n\"If you applied for IBR and your servicer is holding your application, your servicer will process your application in the order in which it was received,\" the department said.\n\nIBR plans give borrowers monthly payments based on their incomes, with student-loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years, depending on when they first took out the loan. Specifically, borrowers who took out loans before July 1, 2014, will receive IBR payments based on 15% of their income with a 25-year repayment period. Borrowers who took out loans after that date will receive payments based on 10% of their income with a 20-year repayment period.\n\nAfter a backlog of IBR application processing, the Department of Education restarted student-loan forgiveness in the fall for borrowers who had reached their payment thresholds.\n\nIn addition to the IBR changes, the department is also working to implement other repayment changes, including new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students, as well as a new Repayment Assistance Plan intended to replace existing income-driven repayment plans. Those changes are set to roll out in July 2026.",

    "fullText": "For the hefty price of $1 million — plus at least $15,000 in fees — you could potentially get permanent residency in the United States.\n\nThat's the promise of President Donald Trump's \"Gold Card\" visa program, which formally launched in early December.\n\nThe program is designed to attract wealthy foreigners to the US. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at an event on Friday that the program had already raised $1.3 billion since launching.\n\nYet it also comes at a time when the Trump administration is otherwise cracking down on other legal forms of immigration.\n\nTrump signed an executive order establishing the Gold Card program in September. Here's what to know about the program.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration's official website for the Gold Card, individuals can receive US residency in \"record time\" if they:\n\nProspective Gold Card holders can also include their spouses and children on their application, but for a price — specifically, an additional $1 million plus $15,000 in DHS fees per person.\n\nThere's also a \"Corporate Gold Card\" program, which allows a corporation to give one of its employees US residency for a $2 million gift.\n\nThat program also allows the Gold Card to be transferred to another employee, for a fee.\n\nAccording to the website, approved cardholders receive EB-1 or EB-2 visas.\n\nThe EB-1 visa — known colloquially as the \"Einstein visa\" — was originally intended for foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities, outstanding professors and researchers, and multinational managers and executives.\n\nThe EB-2 visa is for foreign nationals with advanced degrees or exceptional abilities.\n\nEven as Trump rolls out the red carpet for foreigners who can pay $1 million, his administration has sought to crack down on other visas.\n\nThe most notable example is the H-1B visa, which is for high-skilled foreign workers, many of whom work in the tech sector.\n\nThe administration moved to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas in September, which initially caused chaos at major tech companies amid confusion over whether that fee would apply to current employees who leave the country.\n\nEven more chaos came as the administration rolled out social media screening requirements for visa holders, prompting some companies to warn their employees against travel.\n\nLast week, the administration also said it would pause the DV1 diversity visa lottery program.\n\nThe US wouldn't be the first country to establish a residence-by-investment program.\n\nIn fact, there are several countries that offer foreigners residency in exchange for payment or investment.\n\nThey include countries like Thailand, Panama, Latvia, Portugal, Italy, and Greece.\n\nThe Gold Card website also teases a \"Platinum Card,\" which they say is \"Coming Soon.\" The September executive order does not mention a Platinum Card.\n\nUnder the proposed plan, foreign nationals will be able to pay $5 million and the $15,000 DHS fees in exchange for a visa allowing them to stay in the US for 270 days without being subject to US taxes on non-US income.\n\nThat $5 million sum mirrors the $5 million originally floated by Trump officials for the Gold Card, which has since been lowered to $1 million.\n\nThe website includes a waitlist, along with a note that there's \"no assurance that the Platinum Card contribution will remain at $5 million.\"",

    "fullText": "For finance professionals, the holidays bring festive cheer and optimism for the new year that we all enjoy. For them, it also brings requests for investing advice and stock picks that sources tell Business Insider they'd rather not have to deal with.\n\nFor many investors, advisors, and others who navigate markets for a living, seeing their relatives during the holiday season often means being asked the same question: What stocks should I buy?\n\nThere's no easy answer, as the stock market is unpredictable and everyone has different risk tolerance, investment horizons, and goals.\n\nColin Sahagun, the founder and CEO of Stelrix, a fintech startup that recently launched an investment-backed spending card, says the question often amounts to, \"How do I get rich quick?\"\n\n\"Every year, someone asks, 'Tell me the next 20 high-growth stocks I should buy,'\" he recalls. \"I will have older relatives asking for 'the next Oklo under 10 dollars' or 'the next Vertiv at fourteen.' They want moonshot ideas and total reassurance at the same time.\"\n\nOklo and Vertiv are two stocks that have enjoyed big runs in 2025. Vertiv has jumped 44%, while Oklo is up a whopping 280%.\n\nSteven Rick, chief economist at financial services firm TruStage, says he's routinely asked for the next hot stock when visiting family for the holidays.\n\nHe notes that a common question is something like: \"Why didn't you tell me to buy Nvidia stock two years ago?\"\n\n\"This is annoying because 'hindsight bias' occurs when family members perceive a past massive rise in a stock price as more predictable than it actually was.\"\n\nAnthony Rasotto, CEO of wealth management firm ARC Wealth, echoed that sentiment, adding that requests for advice on the direction of the market are among the most irritating.\n\n\"The most annoying question is, 'Which way is the market going in the next few months?' It's usually from an uncle near or at retirement,\" he said. \"I always answer: 'I don't know.' If I could predict the market, I wouldn't need to work at all.\"\n\nPeople who work in crytpo also get bombared for advice at the holidays. Adrian Fritz, CIO of digital asset brokerage platform 21Shares, told Business Insider that while he's often asked about the best time to buy bitcoin, he's sometimes asked to name the best asset to buy in the coming year.\n\n\"It assumes there's a single 'best' asset for everyone, as if I've been hiding a secret Christmas stock pick all year waiting to unveil it at dinner,\" he said. \"The reality is a lot less cinematic: good investing depends on personal circumstances, not holiday fortune-telling.\"\n\nFinance pros stress that there is never a clear answer to the annoying stock market questions they receive from relatives. Anthony Termini, a former hedge fund CIO turned investment analyst and commentator, highlighted why many people don't want to discuss these topics in depth.\n\n\"The answer is always, 'who knows?'\" he said. \"More importantly, who cares? Whatever the answer is, it may never be an asset class or security that is appropriate or suitable.\"",

    "description": "TikTok and ByteDance are upping performance bonuses and other incentives for strong performers as they look to retain talent in 2026.",
    "fullText": "TikTok is increasing how much it spends on high-performing staffers in 2026, according to a memo from owner ByteDance sent last week and viewed by Business Insider.\n\nIn ByteDance's upcoming annual performance reviews, the company aims to spend 50% more globally on incentives like bonuses or raises that increase the total take-home pay for some staff compared to the previous cycle, the memo said. The payouts are reserved for top talent at the company as part of a push to keep them happy and also attract new hires, per the memo.\n\nThe compensation adjustments will be applied across most departments, but not all employees will benefit, as the extra spending is for workers who exceed certain scores in reviews, the memo said.\n\nByteDance informed its staff that the pay increases were designed to meet a moment when the tech industry is facing a slew of new challenges and opportunities, making it crucial to attract and retain talent.\n\nPay offers for high-demand tech workers in hot areas like AI have reached astronomical heights this year as companies like Meta have gone on hiring sprees that included nine-figure signing bonuses. Amazon tweaked its pay bands earlier this year to reward its \"Top Tier\" workers, and other tech companies, including Meta and Google, have made adjustments to better separate high and low performers.\n\nPerformance reviews are a big focus at TikTok, and the company pushes managers to avoid grading staff at the mid-point, even if their instinct is \"to avoid conflict,\" Business Insider previously reported. Last year, TikTok adjusted its performance review process to give out more low scores as part of a push to differentiate high performers from weak ones.\n\nAs part of ByteDance's incentive adjustments for 2026, the company said in the memo that it would invest 35% \n\nA larger portion of bonuses will arrive in the form of cash rather than stock options next year, the memo said. That shift may appeal to staffers who are unsure of the potential liquidity of their equity after the company announced plans to spin off part of TikTok's US business into a joint venture next year, one current staffer said.\n\nFor employees who get equity as part of their compensation, the company said in its memo that it's shortening the vesting period from four years to three.\n\nAlongside the payment changes, ByteDance said in the memo that it plans to shift how it structures jobs at the company into 10 different levels. It also said it would have higher standards of performance.\n\nThe new incentive policies arrive at a moment of flux for TikTok and ByteDance. TikTok's US employees learned on Thursday that part of their company is being spun off in a joint venture that includes new investors like Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX.\n\nAs part of the deal, which TikTok expects to close in January, certain key aspects of the business, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing, will continue to be managed by ByteDance, according to a memo from TikTok CEO Shou Chew viewed by Business Insider.\n\nOffering current US staffers the opportunity to receive bigger bonuses next year may help the company retain talent as it goes through a period of transition.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "We don't know why Bari Weiss pulled a '60 Minutes' story — here's why that matters",
    "description": "The new head of CBS News has been immersed in politics since she started. So of course her call to hold a story will be viewed from a political lens.",
    "fullText": "Ever since Bari Weiss arrived as the head of CBS News, people inside and outside the company have been waiting to see whether her politics — and those of CBS owner David Ellison — would show up in the journalism.\n\nThis weekend, they may have gotten their answer. Or they may not have.\n\nAnd that uncertainty is the problem.\n\nIt's possible Weiss had legitimate editorial concerns about a \"60 Minutes\" segment on the Trump administration's use of El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. CBS pulled the segment abruptly before it was scheduled to air on Sunday evening. News organizations do periodically delay or spike stories.\n\nBut the reported details around this decision make it hard to take the explanation entirely at face value. And Weiss's position — and the politics surrounding her appointment — mean that editorial calls like this one will always be read for hints of political bias.\n\nThe segment, reported by Sharyn Alfonsi, had been promoted by CBS ahead of Sunday's broadcast and, according to multiple accounts, had cleared the network's standard internal processes. A few hours before airtime, CBS News announced that the segment needed additional reporting and editorial work.\n\n\"In my view, pulling it now — after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,\" she wrote in a note to her co-workers. \"We are trading 50 years of 'Gold Standard' reputation for a single week of political quiet.\"\n\nWeiss, meanwhile, told her staff Monday morning that she held the story because \"it did not advance the ball,\" and because it didn't include on-camera comment from the Trump administration, which had sent hundreds of Venezuelans to the prison, where many were reportedly tortured. She had previously sent a memo to \"60 Minutes\" producers complaining that the report they'd made didn't provide viewers with \"the full context they need to assess the story.\"\n\nThere are two big problems with those arguments: 1) Making them so late in the process of a long-running investigation, shortly before the air date, is guaranteed to raise eyebrows. And 2) arguing that a story about the Trump administration can't air without on-camera participation from the Trump administration leads to a chilling endpoint: If the Trump administration doesn't want a story to run on \"60 Minutes,\" it can kill it by not showing up on camera.\n\nNow, add in the environment Weiss stepped into. She arrived at CBS News through a deal engineered by Paramount's owners, the Ellison family, at a moment when the Ellison family is deeply enmeshed with the Trump administration.\n\nDavid Ellison's father, Larry, who funded his son's acquisition of Paramount, controls Oracle — which just got approval to acquire part of the US operations of TikTok, in a deal the Trump administration negotiated with the Chinese government. And the Ellisons are also trying to get Trump to favor their bid to buy Warner Bros. Discovery — a deal that would require approval from the Trump-controlled Department of Justice, as well as other regulators.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has already been complaining about \"60 Minutes\" under Ellison's ownership. \"For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,\" he posted on his Truth Social platform last week.\n\nNone of which proves that politics drove Weiss' decision. And it's understandable if the way \"60 Minutes\" used to work isn't the way Weiss wants it to work — she's the new boss, and she has spent much of her career complaining about big media institutions like \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nBut it explains why people are wondering if Weiss' call was directly, or indirectly, influenced by her owner and his political status. I've asked Weiss for comment; a Paramount rep declined to comment.\n\nWhat we do know is this: The decision was made inside a system where the people who own the newsroom need things from a president who wants leverage over the press.\n\nIn that world, suspicion isn't paranoia. It's a rational response to how power works. And it's not something Weiss can fix, explain away, or out-communicate.",

    "description": "Extending an H-1B visa used to mean a quick trip abroad. Now it can mean getting stranded, as consular officers review applicants' social-media posts.",
    "fullText": "Reupping an H-1B visa used to mean a quick trip abroad. Now it can mean getting stranded.\n\nGoogle, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies are advising some employees with visas not to travel outside the US because of a new Trump administration policy mandating that consular officers review visa applicants' social-media posts before issuing visas.\n\nThe extra screening is dragging out processing, and some embassies and consulates are canceling or pushing back visa appointments — in some cases by many months — as the backlog grows.\n\nAn H-1B visa is basically a travel document — the stamp in a worker's passport that lets them show up at an American airport or border and ask to enter. It's typically valid for up to three years. But it doesn't guarantee admission, explained Jason Finkelman, a Texas lawyer focused on family- and work-based immigration.\n\nA Customs and Border Protection officer makes the final call on whether the worker is allowed in and under what immigration status. The officer issues an I-94 record with an \"admit until\" date, which sets how long the person is allowed to stay.\n\nBecause these are separate processes, they don't always expire at the same time. Someone might have a visa stamp that expires in late 2026 but still have valid status through 2028.\n\nThat means a visa holder can continue to live and work legally in the US even after the visa stamp in their passport has expired, as long as their \"admit until\" date hasn't passed.\n\nHow do H-1B holders get their stamps renewed?\n\nIf a visa holder needs a new stamp, they generally have to apply at a US consulate or embassy, typically in their home country. The visa holder books an interview, where a consular officer reviews their documents and asks questions about their job or background.\n\nIf all goes smoothly, they get their passport back with a new stamp. The turnaround can range from a few days to weeks, lawyers say, depending on where the application is processed and whether it's flagged for extra review.\n\nSome people who traveled abroad to renew their visa stamps have had their appointments delayed or rescheduled, sometimes with little warning. Until they have that stamp in hand, they can't board a return flight or show up at the border and expect to be admitted.\n\nThe new social-media screenings are a big part of what's gumming up the process. Starting December 15, the State Department expanded its \"online presence\" reviews to all H-1B applicants and their H-4 family members, and instructed applicants to set their social media profiles to public so consular officers can review their activity.\n\nJustin Parsons, a partner at the global immigration law firm BAL, said around 40 or 50 of his clients are unable to return to the US while they wait for visa stamps. He said his clients are experiencing longer delays in Hyderabad and Chennai, India.\n\nA State Department spokesperson told Business Insider on Thursday that the purpose of the reviews is to use \"all available tools\" to flag applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests or intend to engage in activities inconsistent with the terms of their visas.\n\nWhat does the new social-media screening involve?\n\nWhat this new screening looks like in practice is still coming into focus. The State Department hasn't spelled out exactly how consular officers are weighing social media posts, or how long the added reviews might take.\n\nWhat advice are immigration attorneys giving to visa applicants?\n\nVisa applicants should carefully review their profiles to make sure basic details, like job titles, employers, locations, and timelines, line up with what's in their visa paperwork, according to lawyers at Duane Morris and Fisher Phillips. Even small discrepancies, they warn, can trigger questions or additional review.\n\nSome firms also caution against scrambling to clean up accounts or deleting posts at the last minute. If an immigration official notices, it could be seen as evasive.\n\nFor now, lawyers are urging caution. In some cases, lawyers say, the safest move right now may be not traveling at all.\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mrussell@businessinsider.com or Signal at @MeliaRussell.01.

    "fullText": "Google told employees it will be \"ramping up\" PERM applications in 2026 for eligible employees, a crucial step to securing a green card.\n\nThe company told staff in a December newsletter that employees eligible for PERM would hear from its outside lawyers in Q1, according to a copy of the memo seen by Business Insider.\n\nPERM allows employees to move from working on a visa to securing a green card. Tech companies commonly use it to transition staff from H-1 B status to a green card, which allows them to live and work permanently in the US.\n\nTech employees on work visas have faced increased uncertainty this year due to policy changes, such as the rise in H-1B visa fees. Google's lawyers recently advised employees with work visas, such as the H-1B, to avoid international travel due to \"significant\" delays, Business Insider reported.\n\nAccording to the memo about PERM, only those who meet certain criteria will be eligible for the application. One requirement is that employees must work in a role that requires a degree and prior work experience.\n\nThe memo also said that staff must work from a Google office to be considered.\n\n\"Remote Googlers must agree to transfer to an office to be PERM eligible,\" the memo read.\n\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe PERM process is designed to ensure that hiring foreign workers doesn't harm the job opportunities or working conditions of US workers. As such, the company sponsoring the worker must prove that there are no available qualified US citizens who can fill the role.\n\nGoogle paused PERM applications in January 2023, the same month it laid off 12,000 employees, Business Insider previously reported. Amazon, Meta, and other tech companies similarly put the brakes on PERM as a wave of job cuts made it harder to justify hiring outside the US, as per the program's terms.\n\nThe sweeping layoffs meant the market was flooded with people looking for work, making it harder for employers to hire foreign workers.\n\nGoogle applied for PERM for a small handful of employees throughout this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The announcement about 2026 marks a scaling up of the program, the person said.\n\nGoogle told staff in the memo that there is a bar to clear for PERM applications. Employees who are at Level 3 roles or below will be less likely to meet the requirements, the memo said.\n\nIt also said that Google employees would not be considered for PERM if they are \"not in good standing\" with the company.\n\n\"Googlers must have a MI rating or higher to be eligible for PERM,\" it read. MI means \"moderate impact\" — a rating Googlers can be given in their yearly performance reviews.\n\nHave something to share?

To see it, click the plus button in the app and ask, \"Show me my year with ChatGPT.\"\n\nIt's available to Free, Pro, and Plus users, but not those with a business or enterprise account. (So for those with ChatGPT accounts through your work, you likely won't be able to brag to your boss about your ChatGPT stats.)\n\nYour Year with ChatGPT!\n\nNow rolling out to everyone in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia who have reference saved memory and reference chat history turned on.\n\nJust make sure your app is updated. pic.twitter.com/whVkS1qxKu\n\nOpenAI joins the many companies that are rolling out user rundowns for 2025. Alongside the common streamer packages from Spotify and Apple Music, there are recaps this year from LinkedIn, Uber, Dunkin', Snapchat, Strava, Partiful, and more.\n\nAll these apps promise to show you what you've been up to for the past year — perhaps lightly roasting you in the process.\n\nChatGPT's rundown begins with a piece of poetry, followed by the three most prominent themes, based on the user's chat history. Then it gets into the statistics.\n\nUsers can learn how many messages they sent, their total number of chats, and their chattiest day. They can also see how many em-dashes have been exchanged throughout the chats, a figure ChatGPT often uses.\n\nNext, the user can learn about their chat style. This is a measure of tone: ChatGPT told me that I spoke \"casually, wryly, and directly.\"\n\nThen come the awards and accolades. ChatGPT awarded me the \"Most Likely to Google, 'Is this Flight Worth It?'\" It's a bit ironic — I wouldn't Google that, I'd ask ChatGPT.\n\nMy archetype was determined to be the tinkerer, a title given to 8.5% of users. The title meant I learned by trying, and that I used ChatGPT to experiment.\n\nOpenAI has improved its image and video creation models, recently rolling out Sora 2. The recap features an AI-generated piece of pixel art inspired by the year. I asked mine about moving to Brooklyn; it included a matcha.\n\nOther features are more interactive. Want to learn what your 2026 has in store? You'll have to wipe away the \"mists of mystery\" (which looks more like heaps of snow) to learn your fate. Reload the page, and you'll see another fortune.\n\nWith that, ChatGPT's recap comes to a close, but not before sharing an inspiring message.\n\n\"Across all the drafts, questions, and rabbit holes, you found a place to work things out,\" it said. \"And that's no small thing.\"",

    "fullText": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia will use drones to resume spraying of coca crops with a weed killer, the government announced on Monday as authorities grapple with record levels of cocaine production that have fueled tensions with the Trump administration.\n\nThe South American country banned aerial fumigation of coca crops in 2015, after the World Health Organization put glyphosate — the weed killer used by spray planes — on a list of carcinogens.\n\nJustice Minister Andrés Idárraga told a news conference that the new action involving high-tech drones was approved by the government and would begin on Thursday.\n\nHe said the drones would be sent to areas where gangs and rebel groups are forcing peasants to grow coca, the primary source of cocaine. “Our security forces will be safer” that way, Idárraga added.\n\nEnvironmental activists had long warned that small airplanes spraying coca fields — often flown by U.S. contractors — were also dumping their chemicals on legal crops and into streams, polluting vulnerable ecosystems and exposing villagers to contaminated water.\n\nAfter suspending aerial fumigation, Colombia stepped up manual eradication campaigns, carried out by soldiers.\n\nBut the cultivation of coca expanded without aerial spraying as it became harder for the military to eradicate coca crops in remote areas, where plantations are defended by drug gangs and rebel groups, and are sometimes surrounded by land mines.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates that in 2024, as much as 261,000 hectares (about 645,000 acres) in Colombia were planted with coca, almost double what was planted in 2016.\n\nAccording to Idárraga, the drones will fly no further than 1.5 meters (5 feet) from their targets to ensure that water sources and legal crops are not sprayed. A single drone will be able to eradicate about a hectare of coca crops every 30 minutes.\n\n“This is a controlled and efficient” way, Idárraga said, adding that \"it mitigates environmental risks.”\n\nThe idea of using drones to eradicate coca fields was first floated in 2018 by right-wing President Ivan Duque's administration. But plans were delayed due to the lack of a consensus in government agencies and in Colombia's parliament\n\nColombia’s current government, led by left-wing President Gustavo Petro, initially dismissed aerial fumigation and other forced eradication campaigns, saying it didn't want to target impoverished peasants growing coca for drug dealers because they lacked legal alternatives.\n\nPetro's administration became more aggressive on the issue of coca crops this year as it tries to defeat rebel groups funded by the illegal drug trade that have refused to sign peace agreements with the government and that have recently stepped up attacks in Colombian cities.\n\nThe United States has long criticized Colombia’s decision to halt the aerial fumigations. The Trump administration, which has accused Petro’s government of not doing enough to halt cocaine production, added Colombia in September to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years, jeopardizing millions of dollars in military and economic cooperation.\n\nIn October, the U.S. also imposed sanctions on Petro, accusing him of allowing “drug cartels to flourish” in the country. More recently, Washington threatened to authorize land strikes against drug traffickers in Colombia.\n\nPetro has vehemently denied the U.S. accusations of not doing enough to target drug traffickers and says Colombian security forces are intercepting record numbers of cocaine shipments, even if the nation is also producing record amounts of the drug.",

They were living at the hotel from Jan. 17, 2025, to April 24, 2025, and were bitten by bed bugs while they slept, the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe residents notified hotel management about the bugs, which were in the mattresses, bedding and carpet, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe hotel did not answer a call from The Sun News requesting comment on Friday, and the line would not go to a voicemail box.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the hotel should have known about the infestation and treated the area before the bugs were able to harm the people staying there. It further asserts that the infestation caused “severe and permanent emotional distress, humiliation, mental anguish, indignity, loss of pleasures and enjoyment of life,” which will require psychological and psychiatric treatment.\n\nThe infestation also required the victims to spend money on medical care, and caused lost wages, according to the suit.\n\nThe bites from the bugs caused severe injuries, the lawsuit claims, which caused a “significant amount of pain and suffering.”\n\nThe guests are suing for damages and legal costs.",

    "fullText": "A top Republican appears to be seriously eyeing a run for the White House in 2028, which would put him on a collision course with Vice President JD Vance, the Washington Post reported.\n\nMorton Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, said that he believes that his longtime friend, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, is seriously eyeing a run for the presidency.\n\nDuring a meeting in Washington, D.C., in November, Cruz, who has given a number of speeches decrying antisemitism in the GOP, told Klein he had been fielding requests from people urging him to seek the White House in 2028.\n\nCruz, Klein said, came across as someone “seriously” considering such a run.\n\nTwo additional sources confirmed that Cruz is weighing what would be his second presidential bid.\n\nCruz failed to gain the GOP nod in 2016, when Donald Trump won the Republican Party nomination and the White House.\n\nThe Washington Post said that Cruz in recent months has positioned himself as a voice for a more traditional, interventionist GOP foreign policy.\n\nThe senator has also called on the GOP to separate itself from former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, whom Cruz has said is injecting the “poison” of antisemitism into the Republican Party.\n\nCruz has also criticized Vance, a close ally of Carlson, to Republican donors, two people familiar with the senator’s comments told the Pose.\n\nCruz has also said that Vance’s foreign policy views are dangerously isolationist.\n\nVance is widely expected to seek the GOP nomination for president in 2028. President Trump has said that a ticket of Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be potent.\n\nVance widely leads polling on the race for the GOP nod for the White House. The veep is also the favorite of gamblers placing bets on the 2028 race on legal wagering sites.\n\n“Can Ted help craft or meld together the traditional Republican approach with the new reality of what the Republican Party is now?” said Daron Shaw, a political science professor at the University of Texas who overlapped with Cruz as a staffer on George W. Bush’s presidential campaign. “It’s a heavy lift.”",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nWith so little volatility, mortgage rates remain easy to shop for right now. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.03%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.42%. The 30-year interest rate has has been content to remain mostly unchanged since the end of October.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.03%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.03% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,804, and you’d pay $349,599 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.42% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.42% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,439. But you’d only pay $138,936 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.03%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.42%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.03%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.03%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its November forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Initial drafts of U.S. proposals for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia meet many of Kyiv's demands, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday, although he suggested that neither side in the almost four-year war is likely to get everything it wants in talks on reaching a settlement.\n\n“Overall, it looks quite solid at this stage,” the Ukrainian leader said of recent talks with U.S. officials who are trying to steer the neighboring countries toward compromises.\n\n“There are some things we are probably not ready for, and I’m sure there are things the Russians are not ready for either,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has for months been pushing for a peace agreement, but the negotiations have run into sharply conflicting demands from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held “productive and constructive” talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives, though Trump was less effusive the following day, saying, “The talks are going along.”\n\n“We are talking. It's going OK,\" Trump said Monday while on vacation at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Asked if he planned to speak to Zelenskyy or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump didn't say, offering only of the fighting, “I'd like to see it stopped.”\n\nZelenskyy, meanwhile, said “nearly 90%” of Ukraine’s demands have been incorporated into the draft agreements.\n\nThe backbone of the proposed deal is a 20-point plan, he said. There is also a framework document on security guarantees between Ukraine, European countries, and the United States, as well as a separate document on bilateral security guarantees granted to Ukraine by the U.S.\n\nZelenskyy mentioned several key points, such as the Ukrainian army remaining at a peacetime level of 800,000; membership in the European Union; and European forces, under the leadership of France and the U.K. and with a “backstop” from Washington, ensuring “Ukraine’s security in the air, on land, and at sea.”\n\n“Some key countries will provide presence in these domains; others will contribute to energy security, finance, bomb shelters, and so on,” the Ukrainian president said.\n\nUkraine is arguing that the bilateral document with the U.S. should be reviewed by the U.S. Congress, with some details and annexes kept classified, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe U.S. team is now in talks with Russian envoys, and Washington has asked that no details be released, he added.\n\nUkraine strikes deep inside Russia\n\nZelenskyy said Monday he met with his military commanders who reported that defensive lines are holding firm against the Russian onslaught.\n\n“In (recent) weeks, the Russian army has significantly increased the intensity of attacks, and the number of Russian losses has increased accordingly,” he said in a post on Telegram.\n\nUkrainian forces hit an oil terminal, a pipeline, two parked jet fighters and two ships in a series of strikes on Russian soil, officials said Monday.\n\nThe attacks are part of an ongoing campaign to disrupt the Russian war effort and sow fear behind the front line, where outnumbered Ukrainian troops are straining to hold back Russia’s bigger army.\n\nThe strikes also seek to undermine Putin’s attempt to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of military strength in U.S.-led peace efforts, which have yet to make a breakthrough on key points.\n\nThe killing of a top Russian general by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, with investigators suspecting Ukraine was behind it, could be another instance of Kyiv picking surprise targets.\n\nUkrainian partisans burn Russian fighter jets\n\nUkrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal, an ammunition depot and a launch site for attack drones inside Russian territory and Russian-held Ukrainian territory, Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement Monday.\n\nA pipeline, two docks and two ships were damaged in the southern Krasnodar region, and a large blaze broke out, the statement said, without specifying what kind of weapons were used in the attack.\n\nIt added that a Ukrainian-made missile also hit a temporary base for Russia's 92nd River Boat Brigade in Olenivka, in the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\nA separate strike targeted an ammunition depot in a Russian-controlled portion of the Donetsk region, aiming to slow the Russian advance there, the General Staff said. A Russian launch site for attack drones was also hit.\n\nUkrainian partisans set fire to two Russian jet fighters in an operation on Sunday evening at a base near Lipetsk, a city in western Russia, according to Ukraine’s military intelligence.\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense said only that its forces shot down 41 Ukrainian drones overnight, three of them over the Krasnodar region.\n\nRussia targets the power grid again\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces kept up their targeting of Ukraine’s energy sector, aiming to deprive civilians of heat and running water during the frigid winter. Russia has tried to knock out power in Ukraine throughout the war, in a tactic that Ukraine refers to as “weaponizing winter.”\n\nEnergy infrastructure across five regions were attacked during the night, Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy said.\n\nRussia struck Ukraine with 86 drones of different types overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces stopped 58 of them, it said.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "title": "A Cordless Blower Is the Overlooked Tool You Definitely Need",
    "description": "It might look like an overhyped fan, but you can accomplish a lot with one of these.",
    "fullText": "Once you start down the path of DIY, you'll soon realize that any time you find yourself wishing someone had created a tool to serve a specific purpose, someone probably has—no matter how narrow the use case. Case in point: The cordless blower/inflator.\n\nThis tool is exactly what it sounds like. Shaped like a power drill, it simply...blows air (though sort of like a handheld leaf blower, these tools typically come with an array of nozzles to give you a bit of precision with the flow of your forced air). You might think this sounds like a tool you’ll never actually need, because you have lungs. But I'm here to convince you that you're wrong: A cordless blower will absolutely be one of the most useful tools you ever acquire.\n\nHandheld blowers have a lot of uses that make every DIY job you do a little bit easier and faster:\n\nCleaning. Probably the most common use case for a blower is to quickly clean a work area by blowing away dust, sawdust, clippings, shavings, and other small debris. You can use a blower to quickly clear off a workbench, blow dust out of keyboards, engines, or anywhere else. This is also really useful if you have a tight spot where you can’t fit a tool—the blower can clean it out in a jiffy. It’s also useful for a quick cleanup on outdoor furniture or even my deck—while you might want an actual leaf blower for full-scale yard cleanup, a handheld blower can do an adequate, quickie cleanup on demand.\n\nShortening drying times. If you’re waiting on something to dry out before you can move on to the next stage of your project, a blower can speed up that drying time considerably.\n\nCooling other tools down. There’s nothing more irritating than an overheating tool that forces you to stop and wait for it to return to a safe operating temperature. A blower can speed up that process, acting as a high-powered fan with a very precise, narrow blast of air to cool down hot components.\n\nRedirecting dust and debris. When working inside, you often want to use a vacuum to collect dust as you work, but outside, a small, handheld blower can be more convenient. Using it to redirect dust and debris away from you as you work can keep grit out of your eyes and your workspace clean as you go.\n\nInflating stuff. These blowers come with attachments that not only allow you to be as narrow or wide with your airstream as needed, but also fit into standard nozzles. Need to inflate an air mattress, pool ball, or anything else? The blower will make short work of it.\n\nOnce I started using a blower while I worked, I found myself reaching for it constantly just to keep my workspace clear of dust, and then I started grabbing it literally any time a blast of air seemed helpful. You might not think you need a blower in your tool chest, but you probably do.\n\nMost cordless blowers are similar in terms of shape and function. The two from major brands you’ll come across most are Milwaukee’s M18 18V Brushless Cordless Precision Blower and Makita’s 18V LXT Brushless Cordless High Speed Blower/Inflator. They’re both solid tools, but I prefer the Makita because, in my experience, its battery life is much better (the Milwaukee has a bit more power, but I’ve never had a scenario where I needed more power). The Makita tends to last 45 minutes to an hour on a single charge, but when I borrowed a Milwaukee it died about a half hour into the job. Obviously, this will depend on a lot of variables, including what you’re using it for, but the Makita wins for me because every time I grabbed it there was enough charge left to finish the job.",

    "title": "How Useful Are Ankle Weights, Really?",
    "description": "They're cheap and popular, but ankle weights have serious limitations.",
    "fullText": "Ankle weights seem to have tunneled through a wormhole from the 1980s to the present moment, appearing in countless TikToks and Instagram posts. Do they really help tone your legs? Are they worth buying at all? The promises are overrated, but in some cases ankle weights do actually work. Here’s what you need to know.\n\nAnkle weights’ best use is to add a little bit of resistance to exercises where you are moving your legs against gravity. For example, side-lying leg raises become substantially more work for your muscles with even a pound or two of weight on the ankle that you’re raising in the air. Donkey kicks and hollow body holds would fall into this category as well. Weights like these, with 2.5 pounds per ankle, may be a good option if you're new to strength training or new to these particular exercises.\n\nThe ankle weights aren’t necessarily making your ankles or legs work harder, in these examples; they just add resistance to what is still an exercise for your hips, butt, or abs. And the main source of weight is actually your leg itself. If leg raises are challenging, leg raises plus an ankle weight will be more challenging.\n\nThese uses of ankle weights make sense, because they’re a way to add resistance over time. To continue progressing, you’ll need to use heavier weights when your current ones become too easy. Eventually, you may get to a point where an ankle weight exercise is no longer challenging and you’ll need to work those same muscles in a different way.\n\nAnkle weights work best for exercises where you're using muscles toward the center of your body (like abs or hips) to move your legs. In these exercises, your legs provide most of the weight; the ankle weight is just adding to the difficulty. Ankle weights being light, you need to put them at the end of a long lever. In a leg raise, your legs are basically a very long third-class lever. Or to put it another way: the farther away a small weight is from your body, the heavier it feels.\n\nIf you’re running, jumping, or walking, ankle weights can make the motion a little bit harder, but they’re probably not a good addition. Think about why you’re doing these exercises in the first place. If your goal with running or walking is to burn calories, you can do that more efficiently by running faster or farther, no ankle weights necessary.\n\nSome trainers even warn that wearing ankle weights while running or walking may set you up for muscle imbalances or for injury; though it’s not clear if that’s really the case or not. I couldn’t find any solid evidence about injury either way, but historian Conor Heffernan pointed me to a 1988 paper that concluded ankle weights don’t provide any significant extra calorie burn, and aren’t worth the potential risk. That may be the source of the warning, which I recall hearing way back in the olden days of the 1990s.\n\nAny time you’re looking at a small weight—whether it’s a pair of ankle weights, or a tiny dumbbell, or anything else—think of it in terms of progressive overload.\n\nProgressive overload is one of the basic principles of strength training. To keep getting results, you have to use heavier and heavier weights over time. That’s how somebody who starts deadlifting with just the bar can end up strong enough to lift hundreds of pounds. Small weights can help you get started on that journey, but they won’t sustain it.\n\nAnkle weights are often just one or two pounds each, although I have a set like this one that can be loaded with about ten pounds if you put all the little sandbag inserts into just one cuff of the pair. It was handy when I was rehabbing an injury; my physical therapist recommended side-lying leg raises. At first I was doing them without added weight, but I ended up needing most of the weights in the set by the time my rehab was through.\n\nLooking through ads and Instagram posts for this article, it became clear why ankle weights are popular all of a sudden. You can advertise them by putting them on a model with great legs in a snazzy pair of leggings, and having her work out by a beach or in front of a vibrantly colored wall. They just look cool, especially some of the newer styles that look like blocky bangles.\n\nAlso, being fairly lightweight, they’re cheaper to manufacture and ship than, say, a kettlebell. So while they may have a place in your workout routine, it would be a mistake to think you’re buying a versatile or long-lived piece of equipment by treating yourself to a pair of ankle weights.",

    "description": "Two models for tech wealth are emerging, as notable billionaire donors reveal their priorities.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to cut off funding to the pro‑immigration group FWD.us marks a sharp turn away from the high-profile social advocacy that once defined his philanthropy, even as MacKenzie Scott is emerging as the era’s most aggressive backer of equity- and DEI-driven causes.\n\nThe split shows a broader divergence in tech philanthropy: one billionaire channeling resources into science and AI infrastructure, the other pouring unrestricted billions into institutions serving communities historically excluded from power and wealth.\n\nFor more than a decade, FWD.us was a marquee example of Zuckerberg’s attempt to fuse Silicon Valley muscle with Washington policy, pushing immigration and criminal justice reform from the political center.\n\nBut in 2025, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) quietly stopped funding FWD.us—its first year without support from Zuckerberg; his wife, Priscilla Chan; or their philanthropy—formally ending a relationship that began with a 2013 launch op‑ed and hundreds of millions of dollars in backing, Business Insider reports.\n\nThe wind‑down was years in the making: By late 2022, CZI had already begun pivoting away from social advocacy, providing “foundational” funding meant to give FWD.us runway before the partnership ended, and in April 2025, the break was formalized. The timing now reads less like a slow fade than a strategic alignment with Zuckerberg’s rightward political recalibration in the Trump era, as Meta relaxed content rules criticized by conservatives, while the company and its CEO leaned into the new administration.\n\nCZI’s new pitch sounds less like a traditional foundation and more like a research lab: Its leadership talks about GPUs, not gala dinners. In November, Zuckerberg and Chan announced that CZI would concentrate on science and AI, doubling down on the Biohub network of biology labs it has funded since 2016 and recruiting researchers with the promise of massive compute power rather than more office space.\n\nWhere early CZI grants were scattered across immigration, criminal justice, and education policy, the current strategy funnels capital into building infrastructure—data, tools, and models—that scientists can use for decades. The bet is that by underwriting AI‑enabled biomedical discovery and related fields, CZI can claim long‑horizon, system‑level impact without the political volatility that accompanies hot‑button social debates like border policy or policing.\n\nMacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is moving in the opposite direction, embracing the very equity agendas many corporations and campuses are backing away from under political pressure. In 2025 alone, she announced roughly $7.1 billion in donations—bringing her total giving since 2019 to more than $26 billion—with a heavy tilt toward historically Black colleges and universities, tribal colleges, Native scholarship providers, and organizations serving low‑income and underrepresented students.",

    "fullText": "LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivian miners marched in downtown La Paz, the country's capital, and union-organized protesters took to the streets elsewhere on Monday, the first day of a strike over the government's scrapping of fuel subsidies that have been blamed for contributing to dollar shortages and economic turmoil.\n\nThe protests were called for by Bolivia’s Central Union of Workers but many trade groups, including transportation workers, did not join the rallies. Some union leaders said they would go along with the elimination of the subsidies, which had been in place for almost two decades.\n\nBolivia's centrist President Rodrigo Paz, who took office on Nov. 8, ended the fuel subsidy that previous left-wing governments had maintained for more than 20 years, keeping gas prices at $0.53 per liter. An emergency decree by Paz last week put the price of gasoline at around $1 per liter.\n\n“The country is sick and must be healed,” Paz said on Sunday in a town hall meeting that was broadcast on state television.\n\n“Every day, $10 million is spent on a subsidy that benefits smugglers” who resell the subsidized fuel in Bolivia and abroad, Paz added.\n\nBusiness groups in Bolivia have backed Paz’s new economic measures, which are expected to ease dollar shortages and make it easier for companies to import goods and capital.\n\n“We knew that at some point the subsidies would end” said Luis Paco, a union leader representing merchants in the city of El Alto. “There were no negotiations over the new adjustments, but we knew this was inevitable.”\n\nBus drivers unions stayed away from Monday’s protests after Bolivia’s government said they will be able to import auto parts duty-free. Paz has also mandated a 20% increase in the minimum wage.\n\nImports of gasoline and diesel — costing the government up to $3 billion a year — had depleted foreign currency reserves and worsened Bolivia's biggest economic crisis in four decades, following the decline of the nation’s natural gas exports.\n\nBut unions that have traditionally aligned with left-wing political leaders — including those representing miners and coca growers — went on strike on Monday, demanding that fuel subsidies be reinstated.\n\nLa Paz police sealed off access to the central square where the palace housing the government is located, to prevent demonstrators from entering.\n\nIn the neighboring city of El Alto, local councils blocked some avenues. There were also road blocks on highways in six of the country’s nine regions, according to Bolivia’s highway administration agency.\n\n“We are in the streets in a struggle that will continue until that decree eliminating the subsidy is repealed,” mining leader Andrés Paye told reporters. “This government approves regulations to favor business owners and punish the poor.”\n\nUnions aligned with former President Evo Morales, led a massive march in Cochabamba, the Andean country’s third-largest city, and blocked two major highways in the east of the country.\n\nThe bus drivers unions did not join the strike, after negotiating over the weekend with Paz's new government.\n\n“We will continue to work, to serve the people” said Lucio Gomez, a leader of a transport workers union.\n\nCarlos Cordero, a political science professor in La Paz, said the union behind the strike was trying to “show its strength” ahead of next year's elections for governors and mayors. But the relatively low turnout on Monday showed that the union has been weakened, he said.\n\n“In many sectors of the country, there is a conviction that the adjustment was necessary” Cordero said.",

    "fullText": "Former England striker Wayne Rooney has hailed Arsenal midfielder Declan Rice as a \"future captain\" of the Three Lions after watching the 26-year-old help the Gunners return to the top of the Premier League with victory at Everton.\n\nRooney, who captained England for three years from 2014 to 2017, was at the Hill Dickinson Stadium to see Mikel Arteta's side secure a scrappy 1-0 win on Saturday evening.\n\nRice, who has won 72 caps at senior international level, has worn the armband twice before in the absence of current skipper Harry Kane – in a 2-2 draw with Belgium in March 2024 and a 3-0 win over Wales in October this year.\n\n\"For me, he's the one who's probably waiting for Harry to hang up his boots at some point,\" Rooney said in the latest episode of BBC Sport's The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"He was all over the pitch [against Everton]. His decision-making – when to pass it, where to pass it, what foot to pass it to, his detail on his pass – it was a pleasure to watch. He was absolutely incredible.\n\n\"He was splitting centre-backs, taking the ball off [Arsenal's] centre-backs, acting as a third centre-back, then next minute he's in the box, trying to score a goal. Sometimes, some of the stuff he does is a bit underrated.\n\n\"He's the right one to take over [Kane] for me, because [of] his drive, his personality. Everyone seems to love him, who knows him, who's close to him. He's irreplaceable for England.\"",

The governing bodies deny liability.\n\nIn a previous hearing, Susan Rodway KC for the players said the order to provide medical records was \"impossible, onerous and costly\".\n\nBut a High Court judge has refused the appeal, saying the order is \"not disproportionate, oppressive, irrational or legally perverse\".\n\nRylands Garth, the law firm bringing the case, said it is grateful to the judge for providing clarity and that it would comply with the court's orders.\n\nJudge Dexter Dias said orders issued in February 2024 and 2025 which required the claimants to hand over medical records and all documents from neurological testing were proportionate and necessary to manage the litigation.\n\nWorld Rugby, the RFU and the WRU said in a joint statement that \"player welfare remains a central priority for rugby and we shall not stand still in this space\".\n\nSteve Thompson, Mark Regan and Phil Vickery - part of England's 2003 Rugby World Cup-winning squad - former Wales stars Gavin Henson, Colin Charvis and Ryan Jones and ex-England and British and Lions scrum-half Harry Ellis are among those seeking damages from World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU.\n\nIn November, former British and Irish Lions Lee Byrne and Phil Greening were confirmed to have joined the concussion lawsuit.\n\nIn their joint statement, the governing bodies said: \"The judgement expressed concern that there has been a serious erosion of the court's confidence in the way the disclosure process has been conducted, and noted that effective and fair disclosure of the relevant documents was 'indispensable' in the context of the case.\n\n\"As such many players in the case are at risk of having their claims struck out.\"\n\nRylands Garth is being investigated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority over former England prop Will Green's claims that the firm attempted to pressurise him into joining the action despite him obtaining a second, independent diagnosis that showed no sign of brain injury.\n\nThe case is scheduled to be reviewed again in March 2026.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): I know a lot of people will say \"it was 3-0 against West Ham\". But he made four or five massive saves in the early part of the second half, which kept them ahead and gave them a fighting chance to win. Manchester City have been good, but not setting the world alight defensively. Donnarumma has to keep providing and turning up with big performances.\n\nReece James (Chelsea): We have had Reece in the team a few times and, ahead of the World Cup, he looks the real deal. We have never questioned his ability, but he falls into the 'if he is fit' category. At the moment he has not had an injury for a year and touch wood that continues. His free-kick in the draw at Newcastle was a pearler.\n\nPiero Hincapie (Arsenal): Slightly going under the radar for Arsenal. They brought him in late, when other people were looking at him, and he has been excellent. A solid performance against Everton.\n\nJoachim Andersen (Fulham): For years he has come with class for Fulham. He hits that lovely raking diagonal pass and his organisational skills also help. He organises and marshalls that defence, and did so again against Forest. He is very astute.\n\nAntonee Robinson (Fulham): It is good to see him back. A big season with a World Cup coming up and he is vital for the United States. He had some tough times with injuries but is starting to show he is getting back to his best.\n\nKeane Lewis-Potter (Brentford): He has previously been deployed at full-back but now we are starting to see him in his more favoured position further up the field. Two wonderful goals in a huge game for Brentford at Wolves and a win that has probably already sealed their survival.\n\nEthan Ampadu (Leeds): I really, really like this player. I like what he is about. Not only has he grown as a player since he left Chelsea but he has grown as a human and a real leader. Big tackles, big moments, he is always there and got a goal in the victory against Palace.\n\nMorgan Rogers (Aston Villa): The man of the moment. Two goals again - both wonderful finishes against Manchester United. Is Rogers the guy to lead England? Do you leave out Bellingham? Foden? Palmer? Just how well he is playing would suggest you would have to have a serious conversation about it. He has seven goals for Villa and is flying.\n\nNick Woltemade (Newcastle): He scored two goals and should probably have got a hat-trick against Chelsea at the weekend. It looks like the return of Yoane Wissa has given him a little spark and put that devil back in him. He is scoring and getting in the right positions. A few weeks ago he went off the boil a bit and maybe he had got a bit comfortable.\n\nErling Haaland (Manchester City): The guvnor, the king. He scored two but probably should have got four if I am being really critical. He is just a machine. His next goal will be his 150th in all competitions for Manchester City in five years. Let that sink in. That is frightening. You could put him in my team every week.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin (Leeds): People are asking if he could make a sneaky run into the England set-up for the summer. I think it would be a big ask considering the amount of injuries he has had over the course of his career. Right now let's just enjoy him being back, fit and playing - and when he is fit and playing he scores goals. That's all that really matters.\n\nDaniel Farke (Leeds United): A brilliant victory against Crystal Palace. Only two weeks ago, people were saying Palace were top-four contenders and were also saying Farke was under real pressure. Now, when you look at it, Leeds are probably favoured to stay up from this position. They have given themselves a fighting chance and this was easily the result of the weekend.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

Both have now scored 11 from 11.\n\nChelsea's Cole Palmer went ahead of Toure when he scored two penalties against Tottenham in December 2024, giving him 12 from 12, but he then had a penalty saved against Leicester in March to end his 100% strike rate.\n\nJimenez now needs two more successful penalties to become the Premier League player to score the most successful spot-kicks before missing one.\n\nOn waiting for the goalkeeper to move before striking the ball, he said: \"It's always what I do. I do it well, so it's something I have been training my whole career. I like to have this pressure with these penalties. I'm happy to score.\n\n\"I've never missed [a penalty in the Premier League]. I'm really happy about that, so I want to keep doing it like that. More penalties to come, I'll be there.\"\n\nBryan Mbeumo joined the 100% club when he made it 10 from 10 in April but that perfect record was ended when he had a penalty saved for Brentford against Fulham a month later.\n\nFormer Brentford team-mate Ivan Toney was another who had scored 10 out of 10 but he was unable to match Toure's record when he missed his 11th penalty against Newcastle in 2023.",

    "fullText": "A host of top sports stars and governing bodies have expressed fears that playing fields across England could be built on and disappear if proposed planning reforms come into force.\n\nFormer Lioness Jill Scott, and Olympic champions Sir Mo Farah and Alex Yee are among those to sign an open letter saying they are \"deeply concerned\" by the potential removal of statutory protections for the facilities.\n\nOther signatories included the heads of the Football Association (FA), the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).\n\nThe government is considering stripping funding agency Sport England of its right to be consulted before a playing field is built on.\n\nIt is part of a plan by ministers to speed up planning decisions as it looks to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.\n\nBut with a consultation underway, the signatories said: \"Playing fields are irreplaceable - and Sport England's statutory consultee role is an important line of defence.\n\n\"Weakening this protection risks accelerating the loss of the very spaces that make grassroots sport and physical activity possible, at a time when participation is growing and demand has never been higher. \"\n\nSport England declined to comment, but this month said it protected more than a thousand playing fields across the country last year. Tasked with increasing physical activity, it has had to be consulted on planning decisions for the past 30 years after an estimated 10,000 playing fields were lost in the 1980s and early '90s.\n\nThe letter has been written by Fields in Trust, a charity that works with local authorities and communities to protect parks and playing fields from development.\n\nIts president, former midfielder Scott, said: \"Bringing together so many people for this letter has been incredibly personal to me. Too many communities risk losing these very spaces. I urge the government to listen carefully. We're not asking for the impossible. We're asking them to protect what already exists, for the generations who will come after us.\"\n\nThe signatories - which also include Eilish McColgan, Sir Matthew Pinsent, Tessa Sanderson, and the heads of UK Athletics, British Cycling and Parkrun, are calling on ministers \"to ensure that any planning reforms retain a meaningful mechanism to protect playing fields and sports facilities for future generations.\n\n\"This is about social justice. The people who need green space the most often have the least access. Without these protections, the health and wellbeing of communities will suffer. \"\n\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: \"There are already strong protections in place for playing fields which we are proposing to keep and we are investing £400m into grassroots sport.\"\n\nBBC Sport has been told no decision will be made until the results of the consultation are fully considered. The government is proposing to remove the Gardens Trust and the Theatres Trust as statutory consultees as well as Sport England, which is expected to reduce more than 3,000 consultations annually.\n\nThis month, the government said there will need to be a sharp surge in housebuilding to meet its promise to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.\n\nBuilders have warned the government will miss its target, after the number of new homes started fell from 207,000 to 139,000 after Labour took office - the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLast week, Women in Sport said: \"Now is not the time to be putting our playing fields and pitches at risk.\n\n\"Any loss of this space now would come at a critical moment, excluding more women and girls from sport and stunting the growth of one of the UK's biggest success stories.\"\n\nIt is among a number of sports bodies urging members to support a petition titled 'Do not remove Sport England as a statutory consultee for planning applications'.\n\nIt has been signed by almost 16,000 people.",

The vehicle’s driver died at the scene, and a passenger died later in hospital.\n\nZampella began his career in video games in the mid-1990s. Most recently, he had been promoted to head of the Battlefield military shooter series of video games at EA Games – Battlefield 6 was released in October to critical acclaim.\n\nPreviously, in 2010, he founded Respawn Entertainment under EA, which created the Titanfall series of mech shooters and the popular multiplayer game Apex Legends.\n\nZampella is best known for his time in the 2000s at Infinity Ward, a studio he co-founded with Grant Collier and Jason West in 2002. There, he co-created the Call of Duty video game series and some of its most acclaimed entries, including Modern Warfare (2007) and Modern Warfare 2 (2009).\n\nThe Call of Duty games have gone on to sell more than 500m copies. In 2010, he was involved with other former Infinity Ward staff in a lawsuit against the series’ publisher, Activision, over unpaid royalties.\n\nIn a statement on Monday night, EA said: “This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work.\n\n“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.”",

    "fullText": "and \n Phil Owen\n on December 22, 2025 at 12:39PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nWhat makes a bad Fortnite skin? There's no objective measure, certainly. After eight years and more than 2,000 skins, Fortnite's library of character skins has something for just about everybody. Since there's so much variety and so many different styles of skins, it would be silly to make this list of the worst Fortnite skin be focused on skins we simply think are ugly. Instead, we'll focus on other criteria--like if a skin is boring, a cheap cash grab, or broken in some way. Let's take a look.\n\nWhen it was revealed that Fortnite would hold a Star Wars mini-season in May 2025, fans were excited to see the new skins that would be coming to the battle pass and the item shop. And while most of the skins were great picks, it was a little baffling that the final new skin of the season was Apprentice Rey. Apprentice Rey had two style options: grey version of the existing Rey skin, and Sith Rey--who appeared for about half a second in everyone's least favorite Star Wars move. It was a weird move when there are still plenty of well liked Star Wars characters that have never had a Fortnite skin at all. -PO\n\nAt first glance, Fortnite's Nutcracker skin is pretty decent. But if you look closer, you'll realize that this is just a Chapter 1 default character with a Nutcracker helmet, whose clothes were painted Nutcracker colors. Since this skin was released in Fortnite's very first season, we might be willing to cut them a little slack on this one--but not until they drop a new, more legit Nutcracker skin. -PO\n\nFortnite celebrated the launch of Marvel Rivals by selling this pretty hideous Doctor Doom skin. This thing is much uglier than the previous Doom skins, and also it's bulky in ways that make it irritating to play with. Shoulder pads that stick that far out on a skin this enormous? Forget about it. -PO\n\nYears before Quentin Tarantino ever considered making a Fortnite movie, Epic collaborated with Universal Monsters to make what was supposed to be a series of short films about the adventures of a new, Fortnite-original Bride of Frankenstein. The first short film was pretty good, but the design of the character was pretty bland and didn't feel much like any version of the character anybody had any affection for. And then they never released any more shorts, and this skin was largely forgotten. -PO\n\nWhile more recent versions of Lexa have been popular, the original cel shaded Lexa is a horror show that's been giving Fortnite kids nightmares for most of the past decade. Her weird red eyes are particularly haunting. -PO\n\nIn a vacuum, this is a perfectly OK new Midas skin. But when you're dropping $30 on a pack of DC Comics skins, it's pretty annoying to see this guy in there instead of a character from DC Comics. This isn't even a mashup skin--Midas Rex is just an unrelated guy taking up space in a very expensive pack. And to make things even worse, this is the only Midas who doesn't have the Midas Touch effect that makes every gun you pick up gold. So it's not even a good Midas. -PO\n\nThis guy, who was the main character on the heist-themed Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass, looks like somebody decided to reboot Ocean's 11 with Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins taking over the lead role from George Clooney. There is nobody on Earth who wants that, except maybe Ninja himself, so this skin is best sent to the archive. -PO\n\nThere have been some great skins to come from Lego passes, like Andy Fangerson and Chewbacca. And then there have been some that were not so great, like this lady who's wearing a red-painted version of the Chapter 2 default outfit.\n\nThis isn't a ranked list, but if it were, this would be number one with a bullet. Mincemeat is not only one of the worst skins in Fortnite, but one of the strangest character designs in a video game in the past few years. While I have to give Epic credit for creativity when it comes to this concept--a terrifying pie man straight out of a horror movie--perhaps there's a reason that no other game thought to feature a skin like this. I appreciate Epic sticking with the Halloween theme, but this confection is ugly and unappealing, and only good for scaring your younger relatives.\n\nPerhaps the most controversial selection on this list, Fabio Sparklemane has divided Fortnite players for years now. I know that the rainbow-haired stallion has his defenders out there, but for me, he looks like a DeviantArt rip-off of a certain beloved child's television show starring colorful horses--a license that Epic could definitely swing if they were so inclined. Perhaps Fabio's generic, NPC-esque appearance is part of the appeal for some players, but for me, he sticks out like a sore thumb, and not in a good way. -SW\n\nFortnite's zombie skins were a major success, and players couldn't get enough of its soccer skins, too. However, the decision to combine the two for yet another Halloween skin led to some underwhelming results. While the skin isn't quite as uncreative as some on this list--the monstrous ball is a nice touch--it's such a specific combination of ideas that it doesn't have much appeal, except perhaps around Halloween time. No wonder this skin is often listed as one of the game's least-popular. -SW\n\nThe first Legendary item on this list, Flytrap is simply one of those skins that makes you ask \"why?\" The character's Poison Ivy-inspired design isn't the worst starting point, but it quickly goes downhill from there, especially in the color coordination department. When I look at Flytrap, I think of a rotting grapefruit, or perhaps your friend's homemade cosplay for a supervillain that you've never heard of. Though Flytrap isn't the worst skin on this list, Fortnite has come a long way since 2018, and you're better off spending those 2,000 V-Bucks elsewhere. -SW\n\nThis skin is another example of a Fortnite design that occupies a liminal halfway point between referencing another media property and making Epic's own version of it. In this example, the ratty bear-suit looks like something that a Five Nights at Freddy's fan might draw up in class, but it ends up as the example that might come up when you Google the word \"fursuit.\" It's inevitable that some skins in a game like Fortnite are going to fall into this category, and Clover Team Leader is merely a recent example. That said, it's quite ugly, so it makes the list. -SW\n\nOne of the very first skins ever sold in Fortnite's Item Shop, Renegade is a great example of how far the game's skins have come since its 2017 origins. In this case, Epic wants you to pay 800 V-Bucks for essentially the default Banshee skin with a shirt that's red instead of orange. Reskins and palette swaps are a well-trod tradition in video games, but unless you're a hardcore Banshee fan, there's really no reason to spend actual money on this. Renegade isn't a particularly terrible skin, but it's here as a stand-in for all of the weak tea reskins that Epic has put in the shop over the years, and it deserves a spot for that reason alone. -SW\n\nThis '80s-themed \"Spandex Squad\" duo have to be one of the all-time strangest ideas for a Fortnite skin ever. When you consider that the average Fortnite player was born at least 15 to 20 years after this fad and aesthetic had already died off, it's easy to see why it's one of the least-popular skins in the game. The actual execution of the jazz cup-esque color scheme is pretty competent, and the hair effects are well-done, too. This is just one skin that's in the game for the dads out there, and there's nothing wrong with that. But you can understand why most players want nothing to do with it. -SW",

    "title": "Islamophobic Elites Lied to Destroy the Life of a Palestinian Brown Student",
    "description": "Jeet...",
    "fullText": "Plutocrats, pundits, and government officials joined together in a racist smear campaign against a queer Palestinian student at Brown University.\n\nTo survive a school shooting is traumatic enough, but to then face a nationwide racist smear campaign that falsely accuses you of being the murderer is even worse. That was the fate of Mustapha Kharbouch, a queer Palestinian student at Brown University. While mourning his fellow students, Kharbouch found himself confronting false accusations. Across social media, attempts by the university to protect his privacy were painted as proof of guilt.\n\nThose who libeled Kharbouch were not anonymous social media trolls but some of the country’s most powerful figures, including prominent plutocrats such as Shaun Maguire and Bill Ackman, government officials like US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, lawmakers such as Representative Anna Paulina Luna, and influencers such as Laura Loomer (who is known to have the ear of President Donald Trump). These figures used their considerable megaphones to try to destroy the life of a private citizen. This racist mob operated with reckless disregard for the truth, likely because they knew that Islamophobia enjoys near-total impunity in the United States. To date, this story has not been covered in mainstream media outlets such as The New York Times. This itself is evidence of now normalized vicious Islamophobia has become.\n\nTo understand Kharbouch’s horrific experience, it is necessary to lay out the facts of two murder cases. The best available evidence indicates that on Saturday, December 13, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente went on a shooting spree that killed two people and injured nine at Brown University. Two days later, while still at large, Valente killed MIT scientist Nuno Loureiro, whom Valente had known in his native Portugal. Valente killed himself on December 16. His body was found two days later. The police and FBI seem to have been extremely inept in investigating the case and broke it only with the help of a Reddit post.\n\nThe incompetence of law enforcement allowed racist and Islamophobic conspiracy theories to run wild. The two interrelated conspiracy theories were that Kharbouch was the murderer and that Loureiro was murdered because he was Jewish and an ardent Zionist. The Daily Mail reported that “Israeli officials” believe Loureiro was “assassinated in his home in [a] targeted attack by [an] Iranian operative.” This reporting was nonsense. There is no evidence that Loureiro was either Jewish or a Zionist. As best as can be discovered, Valente’s motives for the murders were personal, based on frustration over his failed academic career.\n\nAn AFP fact-check gives a useful rundown of how the smear against Karbouch spread:\n\nThe allegations appeared to originate with the anonymous X account “@0hour1,” which repeatedly posted photos and videos of Kharbouch on December 15, sometimes alongside images police had released of the person of interest. The student’s photos and email address were quickly plastered across X, sparking calls for their punishment or death.\n\nMany posts highlighted the student’s documented history of pro-Palestinian activism, while several attempted to compare the individual’s body and gait to a person of interest shown in footage released by police….\n\nRight-wing podcaster Tim Pool and US Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon joined in amplifying the narrative, which gained further momentum as Brown University webpages mentioning Kharbouch or listing their contact information appeared to be removed, fueling claims of a cover-up. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman also reshared multiple posts floating the allegations.\n\nTo protect Kharboch from doxing, Brown University scrubbed information about him from its website. This was taken by Islamophobes as evidence of guilt.\n\nAs Fast Company reports, Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire promoted false accusations about Kharbouch, as well as the erroneous theory of the motivation for Loureiro’s murder. On the social medial site X, the journalist Jasper Nathanial posted a video that Maquire had made about the murders and subsequently deleted. Summing up the video, Nathaniel noted:\n\n[Maguire] claims there is “very strong evidence” that Mustapha Kharbouch, a Palestinian Brown student, “likely” committed the murders of two Brown students. He treats Brown removing pages about Kharbouch as evidence of guilt, completely lost on him that this was a response to doxxing like his. He also falsely claims the slain MIT professor was Jewish and frames the killings as part of a history of “pro-Palestinian terrorism” that he says is supported by [Zohran] Mamdani.\n\nIn a statement released on Friday, Kharbouch spoke of his experiences: “I woke up on Tuesday morning to unfounded, vile, Islamophobic, and anti-Palestinian accusations being directed toward me online. Instead of grieving with my community in the aftermath of the horrible shooting, I received non-stop death threats and hate speech.”\n\nIt’s possible that Kharbouch might be able to get some redress through the courts by launching libel actions against those who defamed him. But this legal remedy won’t touch the larger problem of out-of-control islamophobia.\n\nAs Washington Post columnist Shadi Hamid notes, rabid expressions of hatred for Muslims have become normal on the right in the Trump era. To cite one example, on December 14, Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville tweeted, “Islam is not a religion. It’s a cult. Islamists aren’t here to assimilate. They’re here to conquer.” Vile comments like this have become the norm among Republicans, while Democratic pushback has too often been perfunctory. The defamation campaign against Kharbouch could easily have led to his being physically harmed or killed. Unless Islamophobia and other forms of racism are fought head-on, the US is headed for a dark future.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.
