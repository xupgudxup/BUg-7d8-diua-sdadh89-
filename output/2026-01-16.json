    "fullText": "For the first time in the 12-year history of the CFP, both starting QBs in the title game hail from Florida high schools. But it’s not just the quarterbacks. What’s even more intriguing is that 58 players in the National Championship were born in Florida, which is a blueprint that the new head coach, Jon Sumrall, cannot ignore.\n\n“Florida breeds football,” wrote Hard Rock Bet, Florida’s only legal sports book, sharing a collage of all Florida-born players on Thursday.\n\nBoth star performers, Fernando Mendoza and Carson Beck, hail from Florida but from different cities. This signals that coach Sumrall needs to focus on recruiting local talent to build a title-winning roster for the Gators. This past season, Florida endured a rough 4–8 campaign, prompting the hiring of Jon Sumrall to get the program back on track.\n\nPrograms dominating with homegrown talent justify the importance of retaining local players. In fact, Georgia, under Kirby Smart, did the same thing in 2024-25. They kept most of their roster from Georgia high schools, which paid off with back-to-back titles and a 2025 playoff run.\n\nWhile Jon Sumrall has already added proven talent. The Gators have secured commitments from Auburn WR Eric Singleton Jr., PSU OT Eagan Boyer, and OL T.J. Shanahan Jr., UCF LB TJ Bullard, Georgia Tech OL Harrison Moore and QB Aaron Philo, and more. Meanwhile, the program has also lost nearly 20 players to the transfer portal, including star QB DJ Lagway.\n\nFilling gaps is now essential. But Sumrall’s 2026 roster shows a chance to return the Gators to the glory days of 2008, when they defeated Oklahoma to win the BCS National Championship.\n\nThe 2026 roster features plenty of Florida-born talent, including Bryce Lovett, Dallas Wilson, Jamari Lyons, TJ Abrams, Cormani McClain, and more. While this year’s national championship clearly shows Florida players have football in their blood, the 2026 roster only needs Sumrall’s guidance to turn that talent into execution.\n\nNow, while Sumrall prioritizes retention and has proven his ability to develop talent at its best, something he already showed at Tulane, it’s time for the Gators to step into the spotlight under his leadership. The HC has already hit the ground running at Florida, making roster retention his top priority. That’s probably why key players, like running back Jadan Baugh, quickly re-signed after meeting with him.\n\n“Future Gators matter, sure, but current Gators matter more,” he said.\n\nWhile his mantra is simple: production over pedigree, at Troy and Tulane, he turned unranked and two-star recruits into NFL-ready talent. Now, Florida hopes he can work the same magic in Gainesville. While both teams boast Florida-born talent, which has the better chance to win? Oddsmakers favor Indiana to take the national championship, yet the Miami Nation hasn’t given up hope.\n\nThe Hurricanes are gearing up to face the Hoosiers for the National Championship on January 19, and the excitement is electric. Here, fans and alumni are buzzing, drawing comparisons to past glory days.\n\nRoderick Carter, a former LB and 1987 national champion, sees echoes of his team in this year’s squad.\n\n“It brings me back to the glory days. Brings me back to where we were competing at a high level,” said Carter.\n\nNow a behavior coach and case manager in Palm Beach County, Carter isn’t worried about the doubters.\n\n“I know there’s a lot of analysis and experts thinking Miami is going to come up short. I just think that we have what it takes, you know, to be victorious come Monday night,” he added.\n\nJust like that, the sentiment is clear: this team has talent and the hunger to win. But on the flip side, fans are riding the wave of momentum from the Fiesta Bowl, where Miami defeated Ole Miss in style.\n\n“I think our defense has been really great this year. Our defense and our offense—we have some really talented players; Malachi Toney has been killing it. Shout out to him. He’s amazing,” said Canes fan Daniela Battisti.\n\nWith the last national title in 2001, many current supporters weren’t even born then, but the spirit of the ‘U’ is alive and roaring.\n\nThe post 2026 National Championship Spotlight Offers a Lesson Jon Sumrall Can’t Afford to Ignore as Gators HC appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

That was not the mentality when I came in here.\n\n\"Now, we go into every game to win. That's the part that will get us where we want to be and that makes me really happy.\"\n\nHaving not played for 17 days - because of weather and FA Cup postponements - Fuchs has focused on togetherness within his team, a fundamental part of the recent upturn of performances.\n\nHe revealed the players had a \"nice spa retreat for team building and team bonding\".\n\nFuch's side face 16th-placed Gillingham at Priestfield with the Exiles knowing a result could lift them off the foot of the League Two table.\n\nThe hosts go into the game off the back of their own stuttering form, winless since 8 November.\n\nNewport have won five of their last six encounters against the Kent club, with their most recent victory coming in the first round of the FA Cup via penalties earlier this season.\n\nCounty supporters will be optimistic given the club's recent activity in the January transfer window.\n\nThe Exiles have secured the permanent signing of James Crole from Cymru Premier side Penybont and three loan signings with Tanatswa Nyakuhwa from Cardiff, Ryan Delaney from Swindon and Harrison Biggins from fellow strugglers Shrewsbury.\n\nThe signings mean for the first time this season Fuchs has genuine depth to choose from.\n\n\"I've got decisions to make, but they are good decisions. We have really good depth, quality players.

    "description": "Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs failed to make the postseason this year, and now they may be losing their offensive coordinator.",
    "fullText": "Patrick Mahomes makes feelings about Matt Nagy perfectly clear originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are in rare territory.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, the team did not make the playoffs. Star quarterback Patrick Mahomes also went down with a season-ending injury and the Chiefs ended up going 6-11.\n\nThat lack of success hasn't made teams any less interested in the team's assistants, though. Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo have both received head coach interest from teams in this cycle.\n\nNagy, in particular, appears likely to land a new gig. If the coach leaves, the Chiefs will have to find a new offensive coordinator for the first time since 2023.\n\nRecently, Mahomes was asked about Nagy and the quarterback gave a glowing review.\n\n\"I love Coach Nagy... He gave me a lot of ideas to be better as a person and as a quarterback... Wishing him the best throughout this head-coaching process,\" Mahomes said on Thursday.\n\nIf one of the best quarterbacks of all time likes you as a coach, you're probably doing something right. Mahomes played under Nagy in 2017 during the coach's first tenure in Kansas City, so there's plenty of familiarity between the two.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024 under Nagy, the Chiefs' offense was in the top half of the league in both points scored and total yards. The unit took a step back in 2025, finishing 20th in yards and 21st in points.\n\nHowever, the team as a whole regressed, and the offense dealt with some very bad quarterback play after Mahomes went down. Before the injury, Mahomes threw for 3,587 yards with 22 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.\n\nNagy is now looking for his second chance as a head coach. The first time around, Nagy coached the Chicago Bears from 2018-21 and compiled a 34-31 record. The longtime coach has been with the Chiefs since being fired by the Bears.\n\nSo far, Nagy has been reported to have interviewed with the Tennessee Titans, Baltimore Ravens, Las Vegas Raiders, and Arizona Cardinals for their head coaching vacancies. Notably, Nagy is familiar with Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi, as the two were together with the Chiefs.\n\nMike McDaniel could be headed to the AFC North\n\nRobert Griffin III roasts Browns after disastrous season\n\nDid the Dolphins fire McDaniel because of Harbaugh?\n\nFalcons listed as top landing spot for elite head coach\n\nAre the Cardinals the worst HC job in the NFL?\n\nPete Carroll could be replaced by elite college coach",

    "description": "Jacksonville University guard Priscilla Williams broke the single-game scoring record with 44 points in an overtime victory over Central Arkansas.",
    "fullText": "Jacksonville University senior guard Priscilla Williams got off to a slow start vs. Central Arkansas on Jan. 15 at Swisher Gym.\n\nShe then turned in an electrifying second half and overtime on her way to the JU single-game scoring record as the Dolphins rallied from a 10-point deficit with 8:36 to play and a five-point deficit with less than 30 seconds left in regulation to beat the Sugar Bears 96-86.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Williams scored 44 points, 36 of them after halftime, breaking Edyn Battle’s record of 39 points against Bellarmine in the ASUN Tournament on March 7, 2025.\n\nIt's also the high individual game in the ASUN this season. JU (11-5, 3-2 in the ASUN) has scored 90 or more points in two of its last three conference games.\n\n“That was hard-fought, a great game,” Dolphins coach Special Jennings said. “Our team figured out a way to win. Great teams figure out how to get it done.”\n\nWilliams made 10 of 20 shots from the floor (four of seven from the 3-point arc) and did her real damage slashing to the basket, drawing foul after foul.\n\nShe made 20 of 22 shots from the foul line to break another pair of school records. Brandi Buie had the previous record in both categories when she made 16 of 19 on Jan. 23, 2017 vs. Lipscomb.\n\nAmazingly, Williams seemed on her way to a subpar night. She made only one of six field goals in the first half and missed her only two 3-point attempts, scoring eight points as the Dolphins trailed 40-36.\n\n“I was really kind of down in the first half, but my coaches calmed me down and told me to keep shooting,” she said. “I never even knew it was a record. My teammates gave me the ball. Shout out to them for letting me play my game.”\n\nJennings called Williams, who also had eight rebounds, three steals and three blocked shots “a unicorn.”\n\n“She knocks down shots, gets to the basket, makes free throws ... defensively she’s long,” Jennings said. “Really proud of that kid.”\n\nWilliams leads the Dolphins with 15.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.\n\nWilliams scored 12 points in the third quarter, but the Dolphins trailed 61-57, then fell behind 67-57 when UCA’s Jenna Cooke (21 points), opened the fourth period with 3-point shots on back-to-back possessions.\n\nDespite Williams scoring 10 points over the next 4:06, the Sugar Bears’ Shae Littleford (20 points) helped keep UCA ahead. She made three or four foul shots at one point and the Bears led 77-72 with 31.9 seconds remaining.\n\nIt didn't last. Williams drew a foul and made two shots from the line with 18.3 seconds left and after UCA’s Cheyanne Kemp made one foul shot with 10 seconds left to give the Bears a 78-74 lead, Williams hit a 3-pointer to cut it to one.\n\nEmerie Bohanon was fouled intentionally and missed both free throws with five seconds left. After a timeout, the Dolphins rushed the ball up the court and freshman guard Tatum Brown drove the lane and was fouled with 0.07 left on the clock.\n\nBrown could have ended the game by making both free throws. She tied the game with the front end and missed the second.\n\nBut the Dolphins quickly took control in overtime. Junior guard Bailey Burns (12 points, six rebounds off the bench) scored 10 of her points in overtime, with three slicing layups in the first 1:41 of the extra period putting JU ahead for good. Williams got the school record with two foul shots with 1:05 left.\n\n“We needed this,” Williams said of the victory. “I’m really proud of our team.”\n\nBrown had 14 points and 11 rebounds and Makiya Miller added 12 points. The Dolphins overcame 27 turnovers (matching their season-high) and got out-rebounded 44-34.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Times-Union: Priscilla Williams scores a record 44 points to lead JU to overtime victory",

    "fullText": "Levi’s Stadium is used to roaring crowds and prime-time drama, but Brock Purdy’s most unforgettable moment this season didn’t come on a football field. It came at home, when the 49ers quarterback got the call that his wife Jenna was going into labor, and the team immediately told him to forget practice and be there for the birth of his daughter.\n\nPurdy and his wife Jenna quietly welcomed their first child in July, a daughter named Millie Joleen Purdy. The couple announced the news with a heartfelt joint Instagram post: “Millie Joleen Purdy Life just became a whole lot sweeter.” The arrival was a surprise, but the 49ers had no hesitation in allowing their franchise QB to step away from practice to be by his wife’s side.\n\n“Every single morning I’d wake up and go about my day like normal, just waiting for Jenna to send that text,” Purdy recalled during a press conference. “Then that morning she had her doula over and they said, ‘No, this baby’s coming today.’ I called Coach Shanahan and Lombardi and told them I couldn’t make it in. They were great — they said, ‘Enjoy it. Be there for her.’ And sure enough, our baby came that day.”\n\nPurdy and Jenna Brandt first met as students at Iowa State University and went public with their relationship in November 2022. Purdy proposed the following July in Saint Cloud, Florida, and the couple married on March 9, 2024, in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nJenna, born on Oct. 26, 1999, grew up in Sumner, Iowa, alongside her three siblings. A standout athlete herself, she played setter in high school volleyball before competing at Iowa State and later transferring to the University of Northern Iowa, where she finished her collegiate career in 2022 while studying kinesiology.\n\nNow the two are navigating life as young parents in the middle of an NFL season, something Purdy says has brought him even closer to his teammates.\n\n“So many of us are having kids at the same time,” he said with a smile. “Hopefully, we’ll be together for a while, and our kids can be out on the field pregame. Christian and I have talked about how cool it would be for them to remember us playing in the NFL.”\n\nPurdy is now back leading San Francisco through another postseason push. In a gritty 23–19 wild-card win over the Eagles, a game that saw the Niners lose George Kittle to an Achilles injury, Purdy threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns to help advance to the divisional round.\n\nWatching from the stands in Philadelphia were Jenna and baby Millie, turning the playoff trip into a family affair. Jenna later shared photos from the game on social media, writing, “Took the work trip to cheer on #13! Bang bang!”\n\nFans and fellow NFL wives flooded the comments with support. “Millie in Philly for the win,” one wrote, while Olivia Culpo chimed in with, “Team Millie!!!!!!” Kristin Juszczyk added, “The real star of the show is Millie girl!”\n\nUnder Kyle Shanahan, the 49ers have reached the NFC Championship every year they’ve made the playoffs, and Purdy hopes to keep that streak alive in Saturday’s rubber match with the Seahawks. No matter what happens on the field, the 2025 season has already given Purdy a victory bigger than football.\n\nThe post Brock Purdy’s Wife: When the 49ers Let Their QB Miss Practice for Jenna’s Delivery appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Rival 2025 Africa Cup of Nations final coaches in Rabat on Sunday, Walid Regragui of Morocco and Pape Thiaw of Senegal have both experienced the heartbreak of losing a title decider as players.\n\nStriker Thiaw was part of the Senegal squad that lost the 2002 AFCON final on penalties after a 0-0 draw with defending champions Cameroon.\n\nFull-back Regragui played in the following final, two years later, which Morocco lost 2-1 to hosts Tunisia.\n\nSenegal have played in two subsequent AFCON title deciders, losing to Algeria in 2019 and defeating Egypt on penalties three years later.\n\nBut before the 2025 AFCON, Morocco never progressed beyond the quarter-finals in eight attempts since finishing runners-up in Tunisia.\n\nRegragui created history in 2022 when he coached Morocco to the World Cup semi-finals, shocking Belgium, Spain and Portugal en route.\n\nIt was the first time an African or Arab nation had reached the last four in the quadrennial global showpiece.\n\nWhat made the achievement more remarkable was Regragui had taken charge of the Atlas Lions just three months before the World Cup kicked off after Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic was sacked.\n\nMorocco mocked form and tradition by topping a group including Croatia and Belgium, then eliminated Spain on penalties and Portugal before falling to France.\n\nBased on their performances in Qatar, Morocco were overwhelming favourites to win the 2024 AFCON in the Ivory Coast.\n\nBut after cruising to the round of 16, they came unstuck against South Africa. A brilliant Teboho Mokoena goal direct from a free-kick sealed a 2-0 victory for the underdogs.\n\nHaving qualified comfortably for the 2026 World Cup, Morocco are now one victory away from ending a 50-year wait for a second AFCON title after winning the 1976 tournament in Ethiopia.\n\n\"We are considered firm favourites to win this AFCON. I read that we will win the tournament comfortably. That if we do not win our campaign will be judged a failure,\" Regragui told reporters.\n\n\"My task, and the job of my staff and the senior players, is to keep our feet on the ground and remember why Morocco has not won the AFCON for 50 years.\n\n\"We have not won the AFCON because we lacked humility in many of the tournaments and we must not fall into that trap again.\n\n\"Morocco have progressed since that loss to South Africa. The squad has been rejuvenated. We have introduced young players while retaining the experienced core of the team.\n\n\"We came into this tournament with confidence, but nothing is guaranteed,\" said the 50-year-old born in a southern suburb of Paris.\n\nRegragui was capped 44 times by Morocco during a 14-year playing career, spent mainly in France. He had two seasons with Racing Santander in Spain and one with Moghreb Tetouan in Morocco.\n\nBefore taking charge of the Atlas Lions, his major coaching achievement was leading Wydad Casablanca to victory over Egyptian giants Al Ahly in the 2022 CAF Champions League final.\n\nAfter the disappointment of losing the 2002 AFCON final, Thiaw went to the World Cup in South Korea and Japan later that year.\n\nSenegal stunned defending champions France 1-0 in the opening match and exceeded expectations by reaching the quarter-finals, where they fell to Turkey.\n\nDakar-born Thiaw scored five goals in 16 national team appearances and played for clubs in France, Switzerland, Russia and Spain before retiring in 2009.\n\nAfter three seasons coaching Niarry Tally, a club bankrolled by a biscuit company, he was put in charge of the Senegal team preparing for the 2023 African Nations Championship (CHAN), a competition restricted to home-based footballers.\n\nThiaw unexpectedly led his country to glory, defeating hosts and favourites Algeria on penalties in the final after a goalless draw.\n\nNow 44, he succeeded Aliou Cisse as coach of the senior national team in December 2024 and has lost just once -- to Brazil in a London friendly match.",

    "description": "The Knicks blew an early double-digit lead and were defeated by the Golden State Warriors on Thursday night.",
    "fullText": "The Knicks were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 126-113 on Thursday night at the Chase Center.\n\n- The Knicks were without Jalen Brunson due to an ankle injury, but they did receive a nice boost, as Landry Shamet was finally deemed ready to return after missing the last 25 games with a dislocated shoulder. Shamet didn't jump back into the starting lineup, though, as it was Miles McBride who slid in in Brunson's place.\n\n- New York was able to get off to a much better start coming off one of their worst offensive performances of the season on Wednesday in Sacramento. Every starter recorded a bucket and they knocked down six of their first seven shots from behind the arc to open a quick double-digit advantage (15-5).\n\nShamet was the first man off the bench halfway through the first, and he immediately knocked down his first shot.\n\n- The Knicks pushed the lead out to as many as 17 points, but Karl-Anthony Towns was forced to the bench after picking up a pair of early fouls, and Golden State was able to flip the momentum. The home team used a 13-2 run to cut the deficit all the way back down to five at the end of the opening quarter (35-30).\n\n- Towns had five points and a game-high six rebounds in the first before being forced to the bench. The big man continued his domination into the second, picking up four more boards and a pair of putback buckets to help keep the slim lead midway through a back-and-forth middle quarter (46-44).\n\n- The Warriors took their first lead minutes later, and they were able to keep it at three heading into the break (62-59). Jimmy Butler led the way with 15 points on 7-of-10 shooting, KAT racked up a first-half double-double, and Mikal Bridges led the Knicks with 12 points.\n\n- Steph Curry didn't make a three during the first half (0-for-5), but it didn't take long for him to snap that skid in the third. The All-Star sharpshooter knocked down his first two coming out of the break as part of a Golden State 13-2 barrage, helping them quickly push the lead out to 11 points (78-67).\n\nMoses Moody added two more triples, giving him seven on the night and a season-high 21 points.\n\n- Each time it looked like the Knicks were ready to take back some of the momentum, the Warriors responded right back. New York simply could not get consecutive stops when they needed them the most, and they found themselves trailing by 12 points heading into the final frame.\n\n- Curry's big second half continued into the fourth, but the Knicks refused to go away, and they used a 10-2 run to get the deficit back down to nine points with just over four minutes remaining. Golden State's hot shooting couldn't be slowed down the stretch, though, and they held on for the victory.\n\nThe Warriors shot 54 percent from the field and 44 percent from behind the arc in the game.\n\n- McBride took advantage of the start with 25 points, Anunoby had 25 as well, Bridges had 21, and Towns had 17 and 20 boards. Shamet knocked down just two of his seven shots in his return and Jordan Clarkson chipped in 11 points, but the rest of the bench combined for just one point.\n\nButler led all scorers with 32 points, Curry had 27, Moody finished with 21 and Brandin Podziemski had 17 off the bench.\n\nCurry got hot after a slow start, making big shots to put this one away late.\n\nKAT 👌 pic.twitter.com/eQNzt8fXJE\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 16, 2026\n\nWelcome back Landry Shamet! pic.twitter.com/6e05v7nXIi\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 16, 2026\n\nThe Knicks return home to MSG to host the Phoenix Suns on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua has returned to the gym, continuing his recovery from a car crash in Nigeria that killed two of his close friends.\n\nThe former world heavyweight champion sustained injuries in the 29 December incident, which claimed the lives of Sina Ghami, his strength and conditioning coach, and Latif ‘Latz’ Ayodele, a trainer.\n\nThe friends had been travelling on a major road near Lagos when their vehicle stuck a stationary truck.\n\nJoshua sustained injuries, but was released from hospital two days later.\n\nIn a statement at the time, posted on X, Lagos state commissioner for information Gbenga Omotoso said that Joshua was “deemed clinical fit to recuperate from home”.\n\nThe boxer has now posted a Snapchat video showing him working out, hitting pads, and riding a stationary bike.\n\nOne clip was captioned \"mental strength therapy\".\n\nThe Watford-born boxer, of Nigerian descent, was on holiday in the country following his victory over Jake Paul in Miami just 10 days before the fatal collision.\n\nOn Wednesday, promoter Eddie Hearn said he believes Joshua will return to boxing when he has had time to heal.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: “He will need his time physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually before he makes a decision on his future. I do think he will want to return to boxing, but that will be his decision when the time is right.\n\n“It is certainly not a conversation I’ll be having with him any time soon. The only conversation is ‘are you OK?’ and sometimes we find people will give that facade of being OK, but what happened to him is not normal and heartbreaking for all involved.\n\n“When the time is right, I believe he will make his decision and you will hear it from him. That is the only voice you should listen to in that respect and we’ll give him his time to make that decision and heal.”",

    "title": "Here's how big the Dodgers' payroll is about to get after landing Kyle Tucker",
    "description": "When factoring in deferrals and luxury tax payments, the Dodgers are projected to pay nearly $120 million per year to put Kyle Tucker in right field.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers were the two-time defending World Series champions and the most expensive team in MLB history. And then they landed Kyle Tucker.\n\nMore specifically, they reportedly got the former Chicago Cubs star to agree to a four-year, $240 million contract, which is effectively the most expensive deal in MLB history on a per-year basis, when taking into account the deferrals in Shohei Ohtani's $70 million-per-year deal.\n\nIt is an outrageous development. The Dodgers needed outfield help, yes, but teams with a record payroll aren't supposed to go out and grab the most expensive guy on the market, on a deal even larger than expected. MLB has tried over the past several years to discourage its biggest spenders from making the game appear even more unfair, and the Dodgers are laughing at them through a megaphone purchased with Ohtani bucks.\n\nHow big does this make the Dodgers' payroll, which was the largest in MLB last season at $416.7 million per Spotrac? It's now reportedly down to approximately $413.5 million, according to Spotrac.\n\nThat might feel like counterintuitive because, y'know, $60 million-per-year outfielder. Here's why that's the case.\n\nThe Dodgers had an enormous payroll and just added another big contract, but they saw a considerable number of contracts move off the books after 2025. And none of those contracts were for their biggest stars.\n\nMichael Conforto ($17 million), Kirby Yates ($13 million), Chris Taylor ($13 million) Clayton Kershaw ($7.5 million), Kiké Hernández ($6.5 million), Michael Kopech ($5.2 million), Evan Phillips ($6.1 million), Tony Gonsolin ($5.4 million) and Austin Barnes ($3.5 million) made a combined $77.2 million and are now off the team via free agency, trades and non-tenders.\n\nHernández was the only one of those players who made a significant contribution to the Dodgers' World Series run. Using Baseball Reference's calculation of Wins Above Replacement, that nine-man group combined for 0.3 WAR in the regular season.\n\nThe Dodgers had also been spending modestly — by their standards — until the Tucker deal. Since the start of free agency, they had signed three players to major league contracts: closer Edwin Díaz (three years, $69 million), infielder/World Series hero Miguel Rojas (one year, $5.5 million) and infielder Andy Ibañez (one year, $1.2 million).\n\nLos Angeles was on track for a less expensive team until the Tucker deal. The team opted to go moderately more expensive in order to add Yahoo Sports' No. 1 MLB free agent.\n\nLet's just go ahead and list them real quick. Here is every Dodgers contract larger than $50 million total, without factoring in deferrals:\n\nShohei Ohtani: 10 years, $700 million\n\nMookie Betts: 12 years, $365 million\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto: 12 years, $325 million\n\nKyle Tucker: four years, $240 million\n\nBlake Snell: five years, $182 million\n\nFreddie Freeman: six years, $162 million\n\nWill Smith: 10 years, $140 million\n\nTyler Glasnow: five years, $136.5 million\n\nTommy Edman: five years, $74 million\n\nTanner Scott: four years, $72 million\n\nEdwin Díaz: three years, $69 million\n\nTeoscar Hernández: thee years, $66 million\n\nEvery contract except for Betts and Freeman has been signed since the end of the 2023 season.\n\nAs for deferred money, let's get into that.\n\nHere is that same list, with the money the Dodgers will reportedly be paying for those contracts after they're over.\n\nTeoscar Hernández: $23.5 million\n\nThat adds up to $1.081 billion, and that's not even every Dodgers contract on the books. Obviously, Ohtani is doing most of the work there.\n\n[Get more Dodgers news: L.A. team feed]\n\nWe should also make a quick note about deferrals. The popular conception is that teams who sign players to contracts with deferred money are kicking the can down the line and will someday have to come up with an enormous amount of cash. We celebrate Bobby Bonilla Day for a reason.\n\nHowever, the reality is more complicated than that. Under collective bargaining agreement rules, teams still have to put up \"deferred money,\" but that cash goes to escrow accounts instead of the players. Once in those accounts, teams are under strict regulations over what they can do with it, but they are allowed to invest the cash in low-risk vehicles.\n\nSo that $680 million the Dodgers will owe Ohtani after 2033? They'll have already put that money up, while enjoying interest and modest returns. That's not nothing when the total sum of money working for you is more than $1 billion.\n\nRemember that $413 million mark above? It's not the best representation of what the 2026 roster, as currently constructed, will cost the Dodgers.\n\nLast year, the Dodgers' CBT number was $417 million. For that number, the Dodgers had to pay a $169 million luxury tax bill, which was larger than the 2025 payrolls of 12 MLB teams. In total, the Dodgers paid $586.7 million for their championship roster.\n\nFor 2026, Spotrac projects that tax bill number to go down to $161.9 million, making the total cost around $610 million.\n\nHowever, what's ridiculous is their tax bill would have been around $99.1 million without the Tucker deal, which is rated at $57.1 million per year in CBT calculations due to the deferred money. Because overages are taxed at 110% at the Dodgers' level, Tucker alone will make the Dodgers responsible for $62.8 million in tax money in 2026.\n\nSo the Dodgers are basically paying $119.9 million to put Tucker in right field. Which is larger than the current CBT payrolls of the Cleveland Guardians, Tampa Bay Rays and Miami Marlins.\n\nYou might be wondering, how did we get here? How is there a team making the George Steinbrenner Yankees look like a scrappy underdog?\n\nThe Dodgers have a lot going for them structurally. They are the dominant team in MLB's second-largest market. They have the largest stadium by capacity in MLB. They have the largest TV deal in the sport. They have a fan base with considerable spending power.\n\nThat's why the Dodgers were spending big and winning 100 games per season under their current ownership group. But this level of financial bombardment, which has now yielded back-to-back titles?\n\nIt is not hyperbole to say that Ohtani's contract is the biggest bargain in all of sports, especially when considering the deferrals. The Dodgers don't make much money from his jersey sales or the broadcast of their games in Japan (MLB divides both of those revenue streams among the 30 teams, so the Cincinnati Reds will make as much money from an Ohtani jersey as the Dodgers), but Ohtani has given them the one international star in baseball, combined with a premium brand and seemingly inevitable winning.\n\nIn the way some call Harvard a hedge fund with a university attached, the Dodgers are a Japanese advertising firm with a baseball team attached. The team has so much cultural cachet in Japan it can name its price for on-field advertisements, and will be enjoying popularity in the world's third-richest country for generations.\n\nCombine that with the usual outlay of winning a World Series, which the Dodgers have accomplished twice in as many seasons with Ohtani, and there's nothing comparable on the landscape of MLB.\n\nThe Tucker contract is going to make a lot of fans angry. It's going to make some team owners angry. And so we come to the salary cap question.\n\nWith MLB's CBA up after 2026, many observers feel a labor stoppage is inevitable. MLB has already made it clear it wants a salary cap, which has been a non-starter with the MLB Players Association for decades.\n\nThe Dodgers' dominance has been treated as an endorsement for the salary cap, to level the playing field of an unfair game. The thing is, however, MLB quite likes when the Dodgers are good. And the Yankees. And all of its biggest teams. The league has seen great ratings over the past two years and the Dodgers are a major reason why.\n\nIt's fun for some to imagine the Dodgers being forced to sell their team off if MLB gets its way with a salary cap. However, the reality will probably be less than satisfying for the biggest Dodger haters, at least in the short term. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred wants to keep labor costs down, but he's also going to want the Dodgers to keep winning, to a reasonable degree.\n\nSo what does the Tucker deal mean for the bigger picture? Maybe not much, especially when the Dodgers bringing him in only brought their payroll up to 2025 levels. And it's hard to imagine the Dodgers haven't already thought up some plans depending on how the CBA negotiations go.",

That’s probably where my perception has changed of late, moreso than at the top. So I’m not beating that drum.”\n\nPate made an interesting follow-up point: it doesn't even matter that the Indiana Hoosiers are currently the class of the league.

    "description": "The Mets swung for Kyle Tucker, but the outfielder ultimately took the Dodgers' $240 million offer, and New York is now trying to figure out how to salvage their offseason.",
    "fullText": "Only a couple of hours after Steve Cohen tweeted that he was looking for signs of smoke, a Vatican-style reference to the Mets waiting for an answer from Kyle Tucker, the Los Angeles Dodgers stunned him and the entire baseball world by signing the slugger to a deal worth $60 million a year on Thursday night.\n\nSo it’s almost too easy yet…the question begs to be asked: does Cohen want this smoke?\n\nOr will he, like most other MLB teams now, hold his cards close to the vest and wait for the inevitable lockout and war over a salary cap that is coming after the 2026 season?\n\nIn short, the Mets probably thought they were raising the bar into rarefied air by offering Tucker, a very good hitter but hardly a superstar, $220 million over four years. And in some ways, they were. Only for the Dodgers to swat them aside almost dismissively.\n\nSuffice to say, Cohen did no further tweeting on Thursday night.\n\nAnd I’m not blaming him or the Mets for drawing a line at $55 million a year (their final offer) for Tucker, as absurd as that sounds.\n\nYet, getting outbid must still be embarrassing in a way to Cohen. He’s a man who’s accustomed to getting what he wants, after all, even if it means spending obscene amounts of money for art pieces to add to his renowned collection.\n\nAs the richest billionaire owner in baseball, Cohen was supposed to be the death of baseball, remember?\n\nYes, the irony here is that this is what most other owners in the sport feared when Cohen said at his very first press conference as owner of the Mets that he wanted to model his organization after the Dodgers, that he might use his billions to create a new Evil Empire in Queens.\n\nRemember, at the time, the Dodgers were indeed a model organization that consistently drafted and developed home-grown talent in a way that allowed them to challenge for a championship every year without blowing the roof off the payroll.\n\nNow it’s different, of course. Helped in large part by the Shohei Ohtani connection that has attracted other Japanese stars and his willingness to defer hundreds of millions of dollars on his $700-million contract, the Dodgers are now outspending the rest of baseball in a manner that may have made even the famously impulsive George Steinbrenner look like a piker were he still alive today.\n\nEvil Empire? More like King Kong at this point.\n\nStill, Cohen has the money if he wants to compete with the big, bad Dodgers. And none of this is to excuse the Mets for what has been an underwhelming offseason.\n\nAs it is, it’s hard to tell if their sudden all-out pursuit of Tucker was part of their plan all along or more of a realization they desperately needed a big-splash move as Mets fans showed their displeasure with their wallets.\n\nDid they suddenly decide they better find someone to hit behind Juan Soto so he wouldn’t walk 150 times next season?\n\nWouldn’t it just have been easier to give Pete Alonso the $150 million over five years? He had made it clear he was willing to ease into the DH role, so I’ll never understand why the Mets drew such a hard line there.\n\nThey were willing to go three years but not five? It just never made sense, considering their need for a right-handed power hitter. And whatever their intentions at that time were regarding Tucker, they left themselves vulnerable one way or another.\n\nAnd now, even if they change course and throw crazy money at Cody Bellinger, well, sure, he’d make them better in a lot of ways, but he wouldn’t fill the huge hole in the lineup behind Soto.\n\nSo it’s hard to see how they’re going to have anything resembling a championship-caliber offense, whether they go after Bellinger or not.\n\nAnd if they were truly going all-in on run prevention, the David Stearns buzzword from the moment the 2025 season ended, why haven’t they made the expected moves to upgrade their pitching?\n\nDominant starting pitching and a lockdown bullpen would always offer hope of beating anyone, even the Dodgers, in a short series in October, yet the Mets haven’t gone that route either.\n\nAll along, I’ve said it wasn’t fair to judge Stearns until the offseason was over. And who knows, maybe now he’ll go out and trade for Freddy Peralta and sign Framber Valdez, and suddenly the Mets will have a starting rotation that can indeed beat anybody, especially if Nolan McLean blossoms into the ace everyone is now expecting.\n\nBut lest we forget, Edwin Diaz is now a Dodger, too. And while I’m laying some of that on Diaz for seemingly wanting to take the easy route to winning a championship ring, the Mets put themselves in a position to let it happen by not locking up their closer before LA ever got involved.\n\nIn truth, the most logical move at this point for Cohen might just be to hold onto his chips, save his money for Tarik Skubal next winter, or whenever the sport is open for business again, while seeing what McLean, Jonah Tong, Brandon Sproat, Carson Benge, Jett Williams and other top prospects look like by mid-summer as the trading deadline approaches.\n\nI’m not saying the Dodgers are unbeatable. The Blue Jays were one hanging slider away from beating them in the World Series.\n\nBut it’s hard to see how the Mets, without dramatic pitching upgrades at the very minimum, can realistically compete with LA for a championship in 2026.\n\nAnd right now that’s on Stearns. You can blame the Dodgers all you want for blowing up the sport and setting up a salary cap fight not only between owners and players, but owners and owners as well.\n\nYet the Mets shouldn’t be sitting here in mid-January trying to figure out how to save their offseason. If Stearns’ plan was to let the market come to him in search of the best value, which seems to be his M.O., well, it sure looks to be backfiring to the point where desperation is now part of the equation.\n\nDesperation and the LA Dodgers, that is.",

The Umpire is focused on the interior linemen, watching for offensive holding and illegal blocks at the line of scrimmage, in addition to checking player equipment and counting offensive players.\n\nThe Sideline & Clock Monitors: The Down Judge and Line Judge patrol opposite sidelines, ensuring players are not offsides or encroaching and ruling on forward progress. The Down Judge also directs the chain crew. Deeper in the secondary, the Field Judge and Side Judge are positioned 20 yards off the line. They mirror each other, watching the widest receivers for pass interference and illegal contact, and marking plays that go out of bounds. The Field Judge is responsible for the 25-second play clock, while the Side Judge serves as the backup game clock operator.\n\nThe Deep Central Monitor: The Back Judge stands the deepest, typically focusing on the area between the safeties.

    "description": "The OFC Professional League kicks off this week and a Baltic League has been proposed, so is there a future for cross-border football competitions?",
    "fullText": "Eight clubs, seven countries and an opportunity to face the world's best for the winner.\n\nA trailblazing new competition kicks off in Oceania this weekend - but could a similar cross-border league follow in Europe?\n\nThe OFC Professional League contains two clubs from New Zealand and one each from Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tahiti and Vanuatu.\n\nIt will be the first professional league in Oceania since Australia switched to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006, meaning the winners will qualify for Fifa's annual Intercontinental Cup - pitting the champions of each confederation together - and the expanded Club World Cup.\n\nThe first round of fixtures begin at Auckland's 50,000-seater Eden Park from 17 January, with four more venues hosting stages before a play-off in May.\n\nOFC Professional League head Stuart Larman says there is huge support for football across the region and expects to see crowds of more than 10,000 in Fiji and the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe confederation is paying for flights, accommodation and transportation to help sides focus on developing their squads, brand and role in the community.\n\nThe hope, of course, is that the competition flourishes.\n\n\"A lot of things have to fall in place before I think we're ready to expand,\" says Larman. \"But certainly the dream is to get to a larger number of clubs.\n\n\"The success of the league will depend on strength of the clubs - so all have strong community links or ingrained community involvement.\n\n\"That's going to be key for them to have financial success, with big portfolios of commercial partners and a strong team off the pitch which is then generating a lot of money to invest in the first team and youth programmes.\"\n\nIt could also prove a scouting haven - a previously untapped pool of players who now have pathways into the professional game and a competitive environment in which to develop.\n\n\"People will be surprised at the quality,\" adds Larman.\n\n\"The best players in each country are going to get 17 highly competitive matches guaranteed - that is going to be an enormous jump, because more regular, highly competitive football always improves the quality of a player.\"\n\nMaksims Krivunecs starts with a disclaimer - he is not the biggest fan of cross-border leagues, although he is the man trying to pioneer one.\n\n\"I feel it is a necessity,\" says Krivunecs, president of Latvia's top-flight Virsliga, who is proposing a 'Baltic League' he hopes would also include Estonia and Lithuania.\n\nIndependent analysis has backed up Krivunecs' \"quite worrying\" evaluation that the Virsliga is struggling to keep pace with Europe's top 30 leagues.\n\n\"The domestic broadcasting deal is the main fuel for any league in the world to develop clubs, the league and the interest for the competition and unfortunately we have zero broadcasting deal,\" he says.\n\n\"We're very limited with resources. We don't have a big sponsorship market.\"\n\nWith Latvian football also competing with ice hockey and basketball for fans' attention, clubs largely rely on savvy transfers and passionate investors - which is why many have only been formed or reformed in the past 10 to 15 years.\n\n\"In this kind of environment you cannot even plan ahead for multiple years,\" says Krivunecs. \"Because if something happens with the investors' main business, the first thing to disappear is support to the clubs.\n\n\"We all want to build clubs with communities, that have a heritage, history, because that's how you make the product.\"\n\nKrivunecs has had to be innovative in trying to develop that \"product\" and generate interest - fantasy football, statistics, quizzes, predictions, full licensing on Football Manager. He has looked into streaming games on YouTube and collaborating with influencers on Twitch and TikTok.\n\nBut his biggest play is the cross-border Baltic League - one he believes would generate revenue, develop players and help clubs grow on the European circuit.\n\nIt is not a completely original prospect, there have been iterations before including between 2007 and 2011, but not in this format.\n\n\"The cross-border would allow us to create more competitive games,\" says Krivunecs, highlighting the difference in strength between the top and bottom Virsliga clubs. Indeed, RFS beat Ajax in the Europa League last year.\n\n\"We created the roadmap - a common structure, common product, common distribution and marketing.\"\n\nClubs in Latvia's 10-team top flight currently play each other four times. A Baltic League would see that reduced to single home and away fixtures before the top four split to face the corresponding finishers from Lithuania and Estonia.\n\nCarrying over points earned against the other three clubs from their country in the first half of the season, Latvia's four would then face those from Lithuania and Estonia home and away to establish each country's champion, runner-up and so on.\n\nSuch a format is important for each nation to keep their current Uefa competitions places - if the leagues were to merge completely, those would be reduced.\n\nAn overall Baltic League winner would be crowned, however, earning additional prize money.\n\nThe bottom six in each country, meanwhile, would compete to decide who is relegated and who goes into a play-off for a European spot against the fourth-best team - effectively guaranteeing each club has something to play for until the end.\n\n\"All these games are super important,\" says Krivunecs. \"Only two spots are neutral. And most important is that all games are more or less against a similar [level] opponent.\"\n\nKrivunecs believes Uefa would consider the feasibility of a cross-border league if the nations involved request it.\n\nHe says the project has full support from Latvian clubs and authorities, but is yet to fully convince those in Estonia and Lithuania.\n\n\"The more we talk, the more we explain, the more information we bring to their clubs, the situation is changing,\" he adds.\n\n\"What I believe is possible is in the next three years to go with the Lithuanian clubs together to show how it could work. And then Estonia could join.\n\n\"And with a perfect situation, if we want to maximise the market, maybe in future Finland could join because the level of the football is quite similar there.\"\n\nA handful of Welsh teams have long featured in the English leagues but other nations have looked into more defined structures in the past decade.\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands commissioned a feasibility study for a proposed 'BeNeLiga' in 2019 - suggesting it could help close the gap on Europe's top five leagues amid fears the Eredivisie and Belgian Pro League were fading.\n\nProposals for a split-season model were mooted, but in 2022 it was decided there was insufficient Dutch support for the project.\n\nVarious proposals for an 'Atlantic League' have also rumbled in the background since the turn of the century, initially including teams from the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Scandinavia and Scotland.\n\n\"I have spoken with Ajax, Feyenoord, Porto, Rangers and Celtic. They are interested,\" former PSV chairman Harry van Raaij told BBC Radio 5 Live in 2000.\n\nEuropean football's governing body responded by revamping the Uefa Cup with a group stage, but proposals - this time including the Republic of Ireland - re-emerged in 2016 as an alternative to the Champions League.\n\nThose plans, however, have gone cold since Celtic said in 2020 they were no longer interested. One figure involved in those talks believes it is unlikely they will be revived, but suggests there could be a future at youth level.\n\nEnglishman Larman, now based in Auckland but who previously lived in Japan and has worked on projects in more than 100 countries, says cross-border competition is something he has regularly discussed with colleagues, especially in Asia.\n\n\"It made more sense because those countries could not sustain a professional league with a large enough number of teams,\" he says.\n\n\"I always felt that Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would make sense - they would play their regular season and then the best teams play a final stage.\n\n\"They would be much more competitive over time and you get better crowds, it builds the clubs and makes clubs more professional.\"\n\nKrivunecs adds: \"I believe currently the Baltics is the best place for the pilot project. If we show the success of this competition, it might trigger different discussions.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "Dolphins predicted to trade for Pro Bowler to replace Tua Tagovailoa originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins need to identify a new head coach. They also might need to identify a new quarterback, as it seems like Tua Tagovailoa’s days in Miami might be numbered, and the San Francisco 49ers might be willing to part with one of theirs, for the right price.\n\nMac Jones, who made the Pro Bowl in 2021 as a member of the New England Patriots, signed a two-year deal with San Francisco in March of 2025, but he’s resigned to a reserve role behind Brock Purdy, so perhaps the Niners would move him if the Dolphins came calling.\n\nMatt Johnson of Sportsnaut predicts that the Dolphins will trade for Jones over the offseason given his experience and reasonable price tag.\n\n“Moving on from Tua Tagovailoa will be expensive, creating a salary-cap situation that greatly limits whom the Miami Dolphins can pursue as their starting quarterback in 2026. That is why a Mac Jones trade makes the most sense,” Johnson wrote.\n\n“It would be a return home for the Florida native, with the hope that this stint yields better results than his time with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jones would join an offense that featured improved offensive line play in 2025, and he would have two excellent weapons in De’Von Achane and Jaylen Waddle. It is a sufficient supporting cast that, with the right offensive play-caller, could allow him to perform well in a contract year.”\n\nBefore the Dolphins make a decision regarding their quarterback for next season, and potentially beyond, they’ll probably want to get a head coach in place, as that coach could well want a say in the QB selection process.\n\nBut, trading for Jones could be a low-risk, relatively high-reward move for Miami. Jones only has one year remaining on his deal, so acquiring him wouldn’t require a long-term commitment, and he should be highly motivated to perform in a contract year.\n\nIf things work well, the Dolphins could bring him back, as he is still just 27 years old. If not, they could cut bait and move on, no big deal.\n\nOf course, this is all hypothetical right now, but the Dolphins will have to do something at quarterback. Perhaps Jones could be an option.\n\nSteelers predicted to trade for Aaron Rodgers replacement over offseason\n\nRavens owner doesn't rule out Mike Tomlin as a coaching candidate in Baltimore\n\nJalen Hurts aims to end Eagles postseason inconsistencies",

Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data.

    "fullText": "India’s competition watchdog has issued a final warning to Apple in a long-running antitrust case. After more than a year of back-and-forth, the regulator says Apple’s repeated requests for more time are blocking the process.\n\nThe investigation began after a 2022 complaint from Match, the owner of Tinder, and several Indian startups. Regulators later concluded that Apple abused its position in the iOS app market. They then asked Apple to submit objections and share financial data needed to assess penalties.\n\nSince then, the case has stalled. Apple has sought multiple extensions and challenged how any fine would be calculated. As a result, the dispute has remained stuck in legal review.\n\nThe commission noted that it asked Apple in October 2024 to respond to the findings and provide key financial details. However, Apple kept asking for more time. The order states that this cannot continue and warns that the case will move forward even without Apple’s reply.\n\nApple says it could face a fine of up to $38 billion if regulators base penalties on its global revenue. Because of this, the company has challenged the penalty rules in court and asked to pause the antitrust case until judges rule on that issue.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple plans to wait for the next court hearing on January 27 before responding. A source familiar with the matter said Apple views the regulator’s move as an attempt to preempt the court process.\n\nIf Apple does not submit its response by the deadline set by the commission, the regulator says it will proceed on its own. That would bring the long-running dispute closer to a decision, even as Apple continues its legal challenge in court.",

    "title": "The Mind as a City: A Systems View of Consciousness, by Ian Reppel",
    "description": "Ideas for a Changing World.",
    "fullText": "Ian Reppel is an Argentina-based independent researcher and audio engineer with a PhD in theoretical physics and has spent nearly fifteen years working in technology across Europe and Latin America. He writes at ianreppel.org on quantum computing, machine learning, leadership, and psychology, with a particular interest in how technology, incentives, and leadership shape human agency. He is currently writing a book on ethical product psychology, examining how psychology can be used to help people flourish without defaulting to manipulation while still supporting profitable products that make a positive difference. He also runs his own music studio, Crow Oak.\n\nThe following essay by Ian was an honorable mention in the 2025 Berggruen Prize Essay Competition.\n\nConsciousness is best understood as a system, not a single entity. Rather\nthan a single switch, it is an entire control panel with many switches and dials that can selectively disable or boost individual components or connections yielding different experiences we can probe in the lab. The systems view provides a cross-species perspective on consciousness, backed by philosophical traditions from across the globe, that also extends to artificial intelligence.\n\nConsciousness reveals itself at the very edges: when we lose it, when we enter an altered state through meditation or drugs, or when we observe its behavioural effects in other species. If consciousness were a single switch, anæsthesia would turn it off and on again cleanly, and every species would have the same neural wiring. Neither is true. Human anæsthetics alter wakefulness, the contents of experience, self-monitoring, or the ability to report to various degrees depending on the drug, its dose, or the patient’s cortical state. That suggests a composite mechanism: a system of interacting subsystems with failure modes that can be induced selectively. Such a systems view is agnostic of the underlying neural architecture or layout, so it maps well to non-human brains, too. All that matters in the systems view are the functions that make experience at all possible.\n\nWhile there is not a clear definition of consciousness that both scientists and philosophers can agree upon, one area where most can agree on a clear before and after, that is of consciousness and subsequent unconsciousness, even across species, is caused by sedation. Anæsthesia and similar instances where people and animals lose consciousness in a controlled environment are ideal to study the nature of consciousness.\n\nClinical neurology defines levels of arousal and access to contents in terms of measurable dynamics and brain networks. While some decry levels as a poor metaphor for consciousness that overlooks its multi-dimensional aspects, others contest that view. Irrespective of each point of view, these concepts do indeed serve a clear clinical purpose. The systems view of consciousness offers mechanisms and a multi-dimensional view with levels and access that is also based on neural correlates of consciousness, yet entirely free from any theory of mind.\n\nAnæsthesia: now you see it, now you don’t\n\nIn the operating theatre, the anæsthesiologist is a magician. While the patient focuses on counting backwards from ten, they apply a few drops of a clear liquid, and, voilà, the patient’s consciousness disappears entirely, only to reappear after the main performance, the surgery, is done.\n\nThe magic trick looks identical in every act, yet that is the real illusion. Different anæsthetics dissociate level and access with different reproducible neural signatures. Propofol produces frontal alpha rhythms that silence long-range frontoparietal communication. Ketamine preserves arousal while fracturing content and inhibiting the sense of self. Dexmedetomidine yields a sleep-like quiescence from which the patient can easily be aroused, often with dream-like reports upon prompting. There is therefore no single consciousness switch.\n\nClinical metrics such as the perturbational complexity index (PCI) distinguish wakefulness from deep anæsthesia and dreamless sleep. PCI measures the brain’s capacity to coordinate across regions. It can even signal hidden capacity in some non-responsive patients. Anæsthetics such as propofol decrease the PCI, whereas ketamine keeps it steady or increases it. Psychedelics also boost the PCI.\n\nDream research shows that the back of the brain can build vivid scenes even when the frontal regions are not engaged. With a pulse, the thalamus can temporarily restore intentional behaviour from deep anæsthesia in primates. Phrased differently, the brain can generate scenes without arousal, while arousal does not depend on any scene at all. Scene construction and arousal are separable parts of the same system.\n\nAltered states of consciousness\n\nWe do not have to enter the hospital to lose consciousness: we do it every night when we fall asleep. During the non-REM stages, arousal and connectivity are lowered, whereas we have vivid dreams in REM sleep. Content generation is therefore decoupled from behavioural output or sensory input.\n\nTraumatic brain injuries such as a concussion lead to a transient disconnection that impairs arousal, routing, or coordination, depending on the locus and severity. A short loss of consciousness often leads to the disruption of arousal pathways. Longer sequelæ cause network-level dysconnectivity. More severe disorders of consciousness (e.g. coma) can be evaluated with complexity measures, such as PCI. Interestingly, the EEGs of comatose patients often resemble those of people under general anæsthesia.\n\nWhen a person faints, it is usually due to a lack of blood to organs. On an EEG it shows up as a slowing down, followed by a flattening, and eventually a re-emergence to normal patterns. In behavioural terms, a patient twitches and becomes unresponsive for a few seconds. This is a clear case of a failure of the level subsystem while the rest of the architecture remains intact.\n\nPsychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin, increase brain activity and complexity and they tend to reduce the sense of self. Mebufotenin even offers, in certain rare cases, a meditation-like trance of pure awareness without the self or the world around.\n\nMeditation does not raise the level so much as tune access by reducing self-chatter in line with the Buddhist concept of anattā, or lack of a self. Seasoned practitioners can often achieve higher levels of synchrony through gamma waves.\n\nIn imaging studies, we can see a clear pattern: the mind wanders, the lapse is noticed, attention is redirected, and quiet returns. Psychedelics achieve pretty much the same, albeit temporarily, through biochemistry.\n\nThese examples at the edges of consciousness demonstrate that the same outward ‘lights off’ can arise via different component failures. Some drugs target arousal, while others affect routing or coordination. Conversely, ‘lights on’ can return through the restoration of a single or select few pathways. In that sense, consciousness behaves like a multi-component control system with bidirectional couplings (to and from the environment), feedback loops, and characteristic failure modes.\n\nWhat we have so far seen is that consciousness is fragile and it can be disabled through level and access subsystems with different outcomes. These are summarized in the table below.\n\nConsciousness: more than the sum of its parts\n\nSome of what humans do is accomplished without consciousness. Consider the jazz musician submerged in improvisation, whose fingers find the right notes before any conscious thought could guide them. Or consider the common experience of ‘highway hypnosis’ in which one arrives at a familiar destination with no memory of the journey, having navigated complex traffic unconsciously. These are not trivial functions; they are feats of incredible computational complexity, run by fast, efficient, and entirely nonphenomenal systems. As we master a skill, its execution migrates from the slow, energy-intensive prefrontal cortex to the lightning-fast, automated machinery of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. It is a triumph of evolutionary efficiency.\n\nThink of the brain as a metropolis at night. Neurons zip across the city like vehicles; it is busy even when we think the city sleeps. Consciousness is a motion picture narrated by the self that casts a spotlight onto a neighbourhood, a street corner, or the entire skyline. It is not factual newsreel footage, but a deeply personal snapshot of life in the metropolis that requires the various neighbourhoods to be powered up and connected through arterial roads and boulevards. The ‘now’ is a clever reconstruction, an audiovisual illusion of things as they were mere moments ago. It is an illusion so seamless no one ever notices it.\n\nIn this metaphor, level is the power grid. When we are awake, the city is brightly illuminated and busy. General anæsthesia is the equivalent of a city-wide blackout. Non-REM sleep matches a curfew, in which the lights may be on, but cross-town traffic is sparse. Access is the city’s news feed. When information is syndicated, it becomes available to many parts of the metropolis. Consciousness is not a single entity or located in a single spot. It is about functions and their connections. In Figure 1, the components of the consciousness system are shown. We shall explore the various components and links and tie them to the city-at-night metaphor to illustrate the purpose of each. It is based on insights from the edges of consciousness in humans and non-human animals; it is not tied to any single neural architecture.\n\nThe arousal/readiness component is the control room of the city’s power grid. When the voltage is high, the nightlife is vibrant and consciousness’ movie can capture whatever moment is of interest. When the voltage drops, entire blocks go dim and the narrator’s voice goes quiet. It can also raise or lower the brightness across neighbourhoods. Without arousal/readiness, people end up in sleeplike states, such as fainting spells or even a coma.\n\nAnatomically, arousal is handled by the brainstem and hypothalamus by means of orexin, which regulates arousal, wakefulness, and appetite. Norepinephrine sets the voltage levels across the entire city by focusing attention, while acetylcholine boosts incoming sensory transmissions.\n\nIn animals, we find similar brain structures. A single mutation in an orexin receptor causes narcolepsy in dogs, which shows that turning a single chemical key can switch off the lights in the dog park. Cephalopods cycle between quiet and active sleep that resembles REM, though with an entirely different neural architecture.\n\nRelay and synchrony are the traffic rules that coordinate remote regions to keep traffic flowing smoothly across the city. It is the precise timing that matters, not the magnitude or density of traffic (i.e. neuronal spikes). In humans, the thalamus acts as the brain’s clock. Failure in relay/synchrony leads to dissociation as in anæsthesia or ignition failures, in which a local representation never makes it outside the own neighbourhood.\n\nEven though birds lack a laminated neocortex, corvids exhibit the mind as a city: a systems view of consciousness 5 responses that mirror subjective detection, which implies a relay-like coordination in the pallium. While octopuses lack a mammalian thalamus, they show coordinated transitions: as they flip between active and quiet sleep modes, several brain regions’ rhythms alternate as if the octopus’ city re-timed all the traffic lights at once to reroute neural traffic. The implementations are all different, but the function is the same.\n\nWhile relay/synchrony enables the city to coordinate traffic across areas without gridlock, coordination is the actual infrastructure to do that: roads, signs, and traffic lights. In humans, the capacity to coordinate reflects large-scale dynamics right between order and disorder, the sweet spot between gridlock and chaotic traffic where neighbourhoods can synchronize when needed and desynchronize to explore. Evidence suggests that the cortex hovers near this criticality point to maximize flexibility in communication.\n\nVarious functional networks exist in the human brain that require long-range communication. For instance, the default mode network (DMN) is active during introspection, daydreaming, and memory recall. Dogs have an equivalent network as well as sensorimotor and auditory networks. The avian brain also has the hardware necessary for coordination, which proves that a cortex is not required.\n\nStreet cameras and microphones furnish the city’s live feed. Sensing supplies the streams that consciousness draws upon for the scenes in its movie of brain city. In the cortex, the primary sensory areas encode features for use in the entire city. When the data feed is offline, the city runs on guesses. That data feed combined with our expectations (i.e. priors) is used to forecast the ‘now.’ This now-casting improves sensory representations of the world around. The brain anticipates and corrects its now-casts as more sensory data arrives. Integration of sensory data feeds is common in all animals.\n\nIn humans and macaques, gamma waves carry sensory data forward while alpha and beta waves feed it back to shape the signal. In mice, similar band-specific feed-forward and feed-backward mechanisms for sensory information exist. Most of sensing is performed in the primary sensory cortices, insula, and brainstem nuclei.\n\nScene construction is done by the art department, specifically the set designer and continuity editor. They use the control room’s displays and loudspeakers to build a coherent shot from partial footage by filling in gaps or painting over seams so the experience feels seamless. A posterior ‘hot zone’ that crosses the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes is the conductor for dreams in the human brain. The orchestra, so to speak, is shared among many regions, such as the limbic system (emotions), the hippocampus (memories), temporal lobe (visuals), and frontal cortex, yet notably without the logical prefrontal cortex. Without the conductor, the orchestra does not play; the conductor alone is not sufficient to dream either. When scene construction fails, it can lead to dissociation of content that feels fragmented.\n\nScene construction is ultimately powered by prediction: the ‘now’ is the brain’s best guess of it, because sensory data is always delayed and only up to a few hundred milliseconds later available for conscious access. Without prediction, we would bump into each door frame, get hit by every ball, or crash a car into where it was a split-second ago.\n\nCuttlefish have episodic memory that combines the what, where, and when of events in the past with even the possibility of false memories due to errors in scene (re-)construction: their ‘now’ is stitched together after the fact rather than recorded live.\n\nThe access buffer is the jumbotron in the central square: when information hits the screen, the entire city can coordinate around it, as otherwise the footage remains local. Whatever is shown on it is only available briefly and the amount of content that can be displayed is limited, so it is a bit like a scratchpad. Experience without the access buffer leads to disconnected consciousness.\n\nThe access buffer is distributed across the prefrontal and parietal cortices, supported by sensory regions. Sedatives decrease the access buffer’s capacity, so that ultimately awareness cannot reach report/action. A similar structure can be found in birds and mammals.\n\nValuation and salience set the city’s priorities right now, for which the salience network is primarily responsible in humans. The component also acts as the switchboard for attention, as it patches communication between relevant regions as needed. In mammals, homologous networks have been observed. Birds and cephalopods set priorities via different circuits that are linked to motivation and action selection. A failure in this component leads to either apathy or extreme distractibility due to mis-prioritized contents.\n\nConsciousness’ film producer is the self-context, powered by the default mode network, for which homologues exist in dogs. With the aid of the valuation/salience component, it also narrates the motion picture. In case of failure of the self-context, depersonalization, out-of-body illusions, loss of agency, or anosognosia-like dissociations the mind as a city: a systems view of consciousness can occur. Internally, the self-context offers priors that bias internal decisions, whereas externally it is a communication interface.\n\nThis is supported by various philosophical traditions. Ubuntu’s maxim ‘I am because we are’ captures Menkiti’s conviction that personhood is constituted through communal life rather than conferred at birth. Hegel and Mead too believed that the self arises through social interactions and mutual recognition. In social species, a stable narrative self improves predictability and therefore trust.\n\nAvicenna imagined a man suspended in air and cut off from all sensations, not unlike someone inside a modern sensory deprivation tank. Such a floating man would still know that he exists, because self-awareness does not depend on the body or the world. It is a thought experiment designed to home in on the minimal conditions for consciousness, in which the self-context is isolated from all interfaces. It presupposes arousal/readiness to sustain awareness, but self-awareness survives even when sensing and report/action are stripped away, though relay/synchrony and coordination are, in the systems view, still needed.\n\nReport/action externalizes the scenes that have been selected in terms of actions, decisions, or communication. Language is a very efficient means, though need not be the only one, especially across species. In humans the prefrontal and premotor cortices translate accessible content into speech and motion, respectively. When there is no report/action, people are locked in themselves as if paralysed: they experience and are aware of their experiences, but they cannot act on them or talk about them. The ability to produce embodied actions from conscious content is present in all animals.\n\nThe world interface is the city’s connection to and from the outside world with sensors, actuators, and environmental feedback. Inner scenes can play in dreams across many species even though motor output is absent.\n\nThe connections can be subdivided into content and modulatory links. The former carry information payloads from one component to another, whereas the latter only alter what content is promoted or suppressed across regions through neuromodulators. Content moves on millisecond spikes, whereas neuromodulators act through biochemical diffusion processes. These are sometimes referred to as drivers and modulators.\n\nWhen we change modulation without affecting contents as in anæsthesia, we lower arousal and long-range communication in the brain. Likewise, when we alter the contents (e.g. binocular rivalry) while keeping the modulation the same, attention boosts the response of neurons that are tuned to the attended feature or location, thus sharpening the contrast without adding novel content. Similarly, when we stimulate the motor area in monkeys without any change in arousal, they can ‘see’ the motion. These demonstrate that the content/modulation split matches different dissociation mechanisms in the brains of various species.\n\nNishida argued that experience without a self is not only possible but pure: it occurs before the split between subject and object, which is exactly the link between scene construction and coordination\n\nFrom the world interface through sensing, scene construction, coordination, the access buffer, and report/action back to the world interface, the links carry content that stitches frames into a consistent audiovisual experience coloured by the self-context. It consists of the entire conscious feedback loop from sensory inputs to outputs, such as movement and speech.\n\nThe content link from coordination to the self-context updates the self model, and the modulatory link back biases information in the coordination component to be about the self. The latter does not carry new content.\n\nThere is also a link back from the world interface to report/action, although such reflexes are obviously not part of the consciousness system itself as they bypass it entirely.\n\nFrom arousal/readiness to everything else, the connections are neuromodulatory and involve norepinephrine, acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, dopamine, and orexin.\n\nThe links from valuation/salience are also modulatory, as it prioritizes content for scene construction (amygdala and insula), the self-context (cingulate cortex), and coordination (salience network). This is mostly handled by reward systems.\n\nReport/action and sensing are connected by means of an efference copy, which is the internal duplicate of motion signals for comparison of sensory information to check whether the actual movement matches the desired one. Since no new content is fed back, it is modulatory.\n\nScene construction is modulated through relaying and synchronization. The same is true for coordination that depends on exact timings across brain regions.\n\nThe systems view offers falsifiable predictions. For instance, specific thalamo-cortical stimulation that restores relay/synchrony without raising arousal ought to restore report/action while under dexmedetomidine sedation, which disables the arousal/readiness component. In macaques, such stimulation awakens the cortex within seconds. Deep-brain stimulation of the central thalamus also improves responsiveness in humans with chronic disorders of consciousness. The idea is as follows: under stable anæsthesia, apply a centrallateral stimulation and check whether coherent report transiently returns. If it does indeed, relay/synchrony are as separate as the systems view claims; if not, it is not an independent lever.\n\nWe already know that we can zap the cortex and listen to the electrical echo, which is the essence of the PCI. What is missing is a sequential experiment within the same subjects: one session titrated to unresponsiveness with propofol and another with ketamine. In both cases, the PCI and directed connectivity (i.e. who drives whom) are to be recorded with a structured debrief on recovery about the stability of self and mental scene. If ketamine yields a high PCI with an unstable self while propofol yields a low PCI with simple or absent content in the same subjects, the systems view holds as there are two independent knobs to control consciousness through anæsthesia.\n\nFurthermore, a patch on the back of the cortex tracks whether people are dreaming. When it lights up in the right way, vivid reports follow upon awakening, even if the rest of the brain appears quiet. So, if that patch aids in building content, then a brief zap during non-REM sleep ought to shift people towards mentation without a surge in arousal. Once awake, we must collect the report. If we can selectively turn up scene construction while the level stays low, the systems view holds. If not, it suggests that content and level are less separable than the systems view claims.\n\nSimilar predictions and experiments can be designed to verify whether each component in the systems view is truly independent from the others. Likewise, we can construct experiments that check similar component-wise independence across species. That way, we can gradually refine the model and arrive at a minimal set of components required for consciousness in biological systems.\n\nTheories of mind and the systems view of consciousness\n\nThe systems view presented here unifies the clinical level and cognitive access that is based on insights from the edges of consciousness and various species. It explains why anæsthetics have different signatures rather than a single signature. We can even map concepts from various leading theories of mind to the systems view, upon which theories of mind stop being rivals and instead own a particular component, as shown in Table 2.\n\nAccording to the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), consciousness happens when a representation ‘ignites’ a long-range cortical network, so it becomes available for report, actions, and memory. The key region for GNWT is the prefrontal cortex.\n\nIntegrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness arises from information integration. The quantity F measures the degree to which information is integrated, for which the posterior hot zone plays a key role. To have a non-zero value of F, all constituent matter must contain trace elements of consciousness, which leads to panpsychism as a prerequisite.\n\nA recent experiment pitted GNWT against IIT and found that neither explains consciousness satisfactorily. Particularly, the researchers found that consciousness arises even without sustained synchronization in the posterior cortex and without an ignition in the prefrontal cortex. Instead, we can map GNWT to the access buffer and both GNWT and IIT to coordination, as they both require broadcast or integration (i.e. coordination).\n\nIn Predictive processing (PP), the brain is a prediction machine: it generates models of the world and updates these by minimizing a prediction error, which is the difference between its guesses and sensory inputs. The entire control system in PP requires scene construction to generate predictions biased by valuation/salience, arousal/readiness to be able to generate and improve predictions, relay/synchrony for fast communication, coordination for inference over sensorimotor information, and the world interface to close the loop.\n\nRecurrent Processing Theory (RPT) says that feedback loops from sensory areas to higher-level cortical areas give rise to consciousness in thalamo-cortical loops. Features from sensory data are unconsciously extracted (e.g. shapes, colours, and motion), for which feedback from higher-level regions provides context (e.g. a face) that is again used to refine expectations in lower-level areas. Local recurrent processing is sufficient for consciousness, so that the access buffer and access consciousness through the prefrontal cortex are merely add-ons for report/action, not consciousness as a whole.\n\nWith Higher-Order Thought (HOT) theory, a mental state becomes conscious when an individual has a suitable higher-order representation of being in that state. Consciousness is thus meta-awareness. The self-context is the seat of consciousness in HOT, which is powered by the access buffer’s higher-order thoughts. Because the systems view talks about components and connections rather than specific anatomical locations, HOT can be mapped, even though it does not deal with a specific implementation in humans or other animals.\n\nEnactivism (En) posits that all cognition is embodied and thus shaped by sensorimotor actions: animals experience the world by exploring it and understanding the sensorimotor patterns their interactions generate. The world interface and report/action are therefore essential to its operation.\n\nThe systems view offers a blueprint for consciousness in silico based on what we know of it in vivo. It is the specific components, their functions, and their connections that give rise to consciousness, not the neural architecture or substrate; there is no magical separation between carbon and silicon. As such, artificial consciousness is a distinct possibility and falsifiable prediction.\n\nLarge generative models display rich scene construction, but they have no intrinsic arousal/readiness tied to a body: when switched off, they do not exhibit activity such as dreams. Their ‘sensing’ is optional. Report is their only output channel with no sense of self or valuation that matters to its integrity. In the case of robots, ‘sensing‘ is linked to an actual body and they can act as well as report, though artificial embodied experiences powered by multimodal models, such as Google’s RT-X Platform, are still nascent.\n\nA possible objection to consciousness as an emergent phenomenon is often voiced by proponents of IIT: how can consciousness arise from non-conscious matter? There is actually nothing mystical about emergent properties in systems. The motion of atoms and molecules generates heat, even though no atom or molecule has a ‘temperature’ as such. In a similar manner, traffic jams happen because of many cars acting and reacting in a dynamic system, even though no single car has a ‘traffic jamminess’ property. Traffic jams come about through interactions, inherent bottlenecks, and flow patterns, where a phase transition occurs that separates a smooth traffic flow from gridlock. Consciousness is, in the systems view, no more mysterious as system behaviour than traffic jams or heat.\n\nThe systems view offers a unique perspective on a classic puzzle, Theseus’ ship, which asks whether a ship that has every plank replaced one at a time remains the same ship. In minds, the analogue is a gradual neural replacement, which is intimately connected to the question of identity. All that matters in the systems view are the components’ functions and their interactions, not the material itself. So, as long as the planks are nailed together in the same way and they perform the same function as before, it is indeed the same ship. If we replaced all neurons with synthetic ones, but maintained the original connections, functions, and links, the mind would still be the same one.\n\nThe systems view matches the ‘fading and dancing qualia’ thought experiment: if qualia could drift (i.e. vanish or shift) without alterations to function, absurd transitions where reports and actions continue as before while the inner movie conflicts are possible. Since that is deemed implausible, a functional rather than material organization of consciousness is more reasonable.\n\nThe systems view turns Theseus’ ship from a paradox into an engineering challenge: with the right tools we can switch consciousness on or off and perhaps even engineer it into existence in artificial life forms. In that sense, Descartes’ evil demon is nothing but a neurosurgeon who can manipulate a patient’s mind through deep brain stimulation.\n\nPhilosophical zombies are functionally perfect facsimiles with no experience. The systems view refines the thought experiment, because it requires us to specify at which level functional duplication is performed. If it is done at the level of components and their connections, the systems view demotes philosophical zombies to unfalsifiable stipulations. Moreover, by probing the edges of consciousness, we can look for specific connections among components we can break (with anæsthetics) or remake (with stimulation) on demand. If zombies are possible, they are only so in a way that shows all the clinical signatures of consciousness yet lacks it altogether.\n\nThe systems view does not solve the hard problem, but it narrows it. Instead of asking why matter yields experience, it asks which specific causal links yield which families of experience. It does not settle all metaphysics, but it fences it in. The hard/easy divide and the explanatory gap still stand. What changes is where the gap is located and how narrow we can make it.\n\nFirst, the problem of phenomenal character becomes empirical. The self-context is a dedicated node within the systems view that monitors and models what the rest of the system is doing. Attention-schema theory and metacognitive models (e.g. HOT) purport that the brain maintains a simplified sketch of its own access and control. When we edit that sketch, people change what they report about awareness even when early sensory coding remains intact. This reframes the debate around qualia. At least part of the ineffable ‘feel’ is the output of a self-monitor that can be tweaked and tested. Any theory of mind must survive these reversible, component-specific interventions.\n\nSecond, once experience is tied to specific components, claims that phenomenal character floats freely above the consciousness system must account for why the same perturbations predictably erase or restore both signatures and reports.\n\nWhat is left of the hard problem is to explain why a particular state has a particular type of felt presence and why the system insists there is something beyond the obvious.\n\nConsciousness as a system is not a novel idea. Fazang’s golden lion teaches that the matter may be the same, but the relationships among the matter are what turn gold into a lion. Consciousness is the golden lion: it may be made out of neurons, dendrites, and axons, but it is the way these are wired up that gives rise to consciousness.\n\nWe even find echoes of the systems view among the Aztecs. In Nahua philosophy, each person is animated by three forces: tonalli (vigour), teyolía (identity, memory, knowledge), and ihíyotl (affect and desire). It was believed that tonalli could leave the body during sleep, which maps cleanly to arousal/readiness. Valuation/salience is equivalent to ihíyotl, whereas teyolía aligns itself roughly with scene construction, coordination, and the self-context, which together provide a coherent yet biased view of the world and the person in it.\n\nPhilosophical traditions from east and west, north and south, have all espoused consciousness as a system for centuries, though not in those words or with the specific components and connections as proposed here. It does suggest a convergent, systems-level understanding of the mind across cultures.\n\nThe systems view unpacks consciousness into a set of interacting functions whose disruptions map to measurable phenomena across drugs, injuries, and species. It shows why level and access are a useful clinical shorthand. More importantly, it reframes cross-species arguments on consciousness; it is about the components and connections, not a cortex.\n\nWhen we view consciousness not as a ghost in the machine but as the dynamic, functional organization of the machine itself, we gain five benefits. First, it is independent of the neural architecture or its substrate, so that it applies across species and even to artificial life forms. Second, it constrains philosophy. Any theory that denies a systems view must explain how individual components can be disabled selectively yet lead to different experiences. As such, it narrows the hard problem though it does not eliminate it. Third, various theories of mind can be mapped to the components of the system, which reduces rivalry and focuses instead on the merits in each idea. Fourth, we can ask better questions about the inner lives of animals and the ethical implications thereof. The Cambridge and New York declarations on consciousness are already a step in that direction. Like the systems view, these are informed by the latest science and philosophy. Fifth, it explains why current AIs are not imbued with consciousness while offering a blueprint for such artificial consciousness.\n\nWhile we still do not know the minimal set of components and connections needed to generate artificial consciousness in the lab, we do know enough to stop arguing about a single switch of consciousness and instead focus on the entire control panel. The task ahead is therefore to chart the wiring of the entire city of the mind.\n\n[1] Adeeti Aggarwal, Connor Brennan, Jennifer Luo, Helen Chung, Diego Contreras, Max B.

The graph models entities, relationships, and contextual signals in a single representation and serves as the foundation for agents that reason over private data.",
    "fullText": "Revenue teams today are surrounded by data, yet starved for actionable insight.\n\nVast amounts of customer and revenue data are generated across an ever-growing set of systems. Core business records live in CRMs and ERPs and are increasingly replicated to data warehouses. Product usage and activity data is captured as time-series events in data warehouses. Critical context is buried in unstructured sources such as emails, call transcripts, support tickets, and public internet data. While each system provides value on its own, the data within them remains siloed. Traditional analytics and BI tools operate within the boundaries of individual data sources, optimizing for aggregation and reporting rather than for understanding how data connects across systems.\n\nThe challenge is not data collection or storage—it is making sense of fragmented data in order to act on it. Revenue teams often struggle to form a coherent view of accounts, opportunities, and customer interactions. Important signals are scattered, context is lost, and answering simple questions often requires manual stitching across dashboards, queries, and conversations. This fragmentation slows decision-making and prevents teams from acting quickly on risk, growth, and opportunity.\n\nRox creates a unified context layer over an organization’s data by building a custom, proprietary knowledge graph for each organization. The graph models entities, relationships, and contextual signals in a single representation and serves as the foundation for agents that reason over private data.\n\nTo support this level of reasoning and flexibility, the knowledge graph must meet two foundational requirements: it must operate directly on enterprise data wherever it lives, and it must adapt to the unique way each organization models its business.\n\nThe Rox knowledge graph is warehouse-native by design. Organizational data remains in its existing systems—including data warehouses, operational databases, and external sources—while Rox provides the compute required to query and transform that data into a knowledge graph. No data is copied into Rox-controlled storage, ensuring that data ownership, access controls, and governance remain entirely within the organization’s environment. This architecture makes the system enterprise-ready by default and aligned with security and compliance requirements.\n\nApache Spark serves as the core compute engine for building the knowledge graph. Spark’s distributed execution model and connector ecosystem allow Rox to operate directly on customer data across a wide range of storage systems, including cloud data warehouses, operational databases, and open table formats.\n\nThe knowledge graph is refreshed through a recurring batch pipeline that runs every 30 minutes. Each run incrementally processes new records, applies updates, and removes stale data across all connected sources. This ensures that the graph stays in sync with upstream systems while avoiding overlapping executions and uncontrolled backlogs.\n\nAt scale, these pipelines process millions of entities and tens of millions of relationships per organization. Spark’s parallel processing, fault tolerance, and query optimization capabilities allow these workloads to complete reliably within the fixed batch window. As a result, Rox can continuously refresh large knowledge graphs on a predictable schedule while operating entirely within the customer’s data environment.\n\nEvery organization represents its data differently. The Rox knowledge graph is built to accommodate this reality through custom-defined mappings and relationships. Organizations define how their existing data models map into the Rox representation, allowing entities and attributes to reflect their specific schemas and business logic. Relationships are equally configurable, enabling teams to express how users, accounts, opportunities, and other entities connect in ways that mirror real operational needs. For example, hierarchical relationships can be defined to allow managers to view accounts and opportunities across their reporting structure. This flexibility ensures that each user sees the data that is relevant to them, modeled in a way that matches how the organization actually operates.\n\nGiven the schema definitions of a customer’s source tables, Rox allows users to define a one-to-one mapping into a unified Rox schema. These mappings specify how individual columns in source systems correspond to Rox entity attributes, including which fields act as stable identifiers. Data types are automatically inferred and normalized as part of this process, allowing source-specific representations to be cast into consistent formats (e.g. converting integers or strings into timestamps).\n\nOn top of these entity mappings, Rox supports explicit join relationships between data across different data systems. By defining which columns can be joined across tables, such as joining a contact table’s account_id field to the id field of an account table, these joins can be used to construct first-class relationships in the knowledge graph, making implicit connections in the source data explicit and queryable.\n\nBeyond basic joins, Rox also supports custom relationship definitions that encode business-specific semantics. For example, multiple relationships may exist between users and accounts, such as the owner of an account versus a solutions engineer supporting an account. These relationships allow the graph to capture not just that two entities are related, but how they are related. Subsets of these relationships can then be used to control visibility and relevance, such as building account assignment rules to determine which accounts a user should see and manage.\n\nAll mappings and relationships are evaluated dynamically. Queries over the knowledge graph are computed at runtime using the organization’s specific schema definitions, relationship rules, and access context. This allows Rox to present a consistent interface across organizations while respecting the unique structure, semantics, and operational logic of each customer’s data.\n\nEach knowledge graph build produces a unified Rox representation of entities and relationships computed at warehouse scale. The output consists of normalized tables for core entities—accounts, opportunities, contacts, and events—along with a relationship table that captures connections between entities. Each entity is assigned a stable Rox identifier while preserving its original source ID for traceability, stored in its own table.\n\nSpark is used to compute and materialize this representation directly in the data warehouse, leveraging distributed execution to process millions of entities and relationships efficiently. While the warehouse serves as the system of record for graph computation, powering interactive use cases requires low-latency reads and high concurrency.\n\nTo support this, the entities and relationships are ingested into Postgres as a serving layer optimized for real-time querying by both the UI and agents. Rather than reloading the entire graph on each build, Rox computes diffs between successive builds and applies only inserts, updates, and deletes to Postgres. This incremental approach minimizes data movement, avoids overlapping batch jobs, and keeps UI- and agent-facing data fresh and responsive.\n\nFor revenue teams, this architecture turns fragmented data into a living system of knowledge. Instead of stitching together dashboards, queries, and conversations, teams get a real-time, connected view of their customers that reflects how the business actually operates. By unifying data across sources and making relationships explicit, Rox enables faster understanding, better decisions, and timely action—unlocking value that was always present in the data, but never accessible.",

    "fullText": "The Sturmabteilung ([ˈʃtʊʁmʔapˌtaɪlʊŋ] ⓘ; SA; lit. 'Storm Division' or loosely 'stormtroopers') was the original paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party of Germany. It played a significant role in Hitler's rise to power in the 1920s and early 1930s. Its primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of opposing parties, fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties, especially the Roter Frontkämpferbund of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and intimidating Romani, trade unionists, and especially Jews.\n\nThe SA were colloquially called Brownshirts (Braunhemden) because of the colour of their uniform's shirts, similar to Benito Mussolini's Blackshirts. The official SA uniform was a brown shirt with a brown tie. The colour came about because a large shipment of Lettow-shirts, originally intended for the German colonial troops in Germany's former East Africa colony but which never reached its destination because of naval blockades,[3] was purchased in 1921 by Gerhard Roßbach for use by his Freikorps paramilitary unit. They were later used for his Schill Youth organization in Salzburg, and in 1924 were adopted by the Schill Youth in Germany.[4] The \"Schill Sportversand\" then became the main supplier for the SA's brown shirts. The SA developed pseudo-military titles for its members, with ranks that were later adopted by several other Nazi Party groups.\n\nAfter Hitler rose to Nazi Party leadership in 1921, he formalized the party's militant supporters into the SA as a group that was to protect party gatherings. In 1923, owing to his growing distrust of the SA, Hitler ordered the creation of a bodyguard unit, which was abolished after the failed Beer Hall Putsch later that year. Not long after Hitler's release from prison, he ordered the creation of another bodyguard unit in 1925 that ultimately became the Schutzstaffel (SS). During the Night of the Long Knives (die Nacht der langen Messer) purge in 1934, the SA's then-leader Ernst Röhm was arrested and executed. The SA continued to exist but lost almost all its influence and was effectively superseded by the SS, which took part in the purge. The SA remained in existence until after Nazi Germany's final capitulation to the Allies in 1945, after which it was disbanded and outlawed by the Allied Control Council.\n\nThe term Sturmabteilung predates the founding of the Nazi Party in 1919. Originally it was applied to the specialized assault troops of Imperial Germany in World War I who used infiltration tactics based on being organized into small squads of a few soldiers each. The first official German stormtrooper unit was authorized on March 2, 1915, on the Western Front. The German high command ordered the VIII Corps to form a detachment to test experimental weapons and develop tactics that could break the deadlock on the Western Front. On October 2, 1916, Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff ordered all German armies in the west to form a battalion of stormtroopers.[5][page needed] They were first used during the 8th Army's siege of Riga, and again at the Battle of Caporetto. Wider use followed on the Western Front in the German spring offensive in March 1918, when Allied lines were successfully pushed back tens of kilometers.\n\nThe DAP (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, German Workers' Party) was formed in Munich in January 1919, and Adolf Hitler joined it in September of that year. His talents for speaking, publicity and propaganda were quickly recognized.[a] By early 1920 he had gained authority in the party, which changed its name to the NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or National Socialist German Workers' Party) in February 1920.[7] The party's executive committee added \"Socialist\" to the name over Hitler's objections, to help the party appeal to left-wing workers.[8]\n\nThe precursor to the Sturmabteilung had acted informally and on an ad hoc basis for some time before this. Hitler, with an eye to helping the party to grow through propaganda, convinced the leadership committee to invest in an advertisement in the Münchener Beobachter (later renamed the Völkischer Beobachter) for a mass meeting in the Hofbräuhaus, to be held in Munich on October 16, 1919. Some 70 people attended, and a second such meeting was advertised for November 13 in the Eberl-Bräu beer hall, also in Munich. About 130 people attended; there were hecklers, but Hitler's military friends promptly ejected them by force, and the agitators \"flew down the stairs with gashed heads\". The next year on February 24, he announced the party's Twenty-Five Point program at a mass meeting of some 2,000 people at the Hofbräuhaus. Protesters tried to shout Hitler down, but his former army companions, armed with rubber truncheons, ejected the dissenters. The basis for the SA had been formed.[9]\n\nA permanent group of party members, who would serve as the Saalschutzabteilung (meeting hall protection detachment) for the DAP, gathered around Emil Maurice after the February 1920 incident at the Hofbräuhaus. There was little organization or structure to this group. The group was also called the \"Stewards Troop\" (Ordnertruppen) around this time.[10] More than a year later, on August 3, 1921, Hitler redefined the group as the \"Gymnastic and Sports Division\" of the party (Turn- und Sportabteilung), perhaps to avoid trouble with the government.[11][12] It was by now well recognized as an appropriate, even necessary, function or organ of the party. The future SA developed by organizing and formalizing the groups of ex-soldiers and beer-hall brawlers who were to protect gatherings of the Nazi Party from disruptions from Social Democrats (SPD) and Communists (KPD), and to disrupt meetings of the other political parties. By September 1921 the name Sturmabteilung (SA) was being used informally for the group.[13] Hitler was the official head of the Nazi Party by this time.[b]\n\nThe Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich Hofbräuhaus on November 4, 1921, which attracted many Communists and other enemies of the Nazis. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a mêlée in which a small company of SA thrashed the opposition. The Nazis called this event the Saalschlacht (transl. Meeting hall battle), and it assumed legendary proportions in SA lore with the passage of time. Thereafter, the group was officially known as the Sturmabteilung.[13]\n\nThe leadership of the SA passed from Maurice to the young Hans Ulrich Klintzsch in this period. He had been a naval officer and a member of the Ehrhardt Brigade, which had taken part in the failed Kapp Putsch attempted coup. When he took over command of the SA, he was a member of the notorious Organisation Consul (OC).[c] The Nazis under Hitler began to adopt the more professional management techniques of the military.[13]\n\nIn 1922, the Nazi Party created a youth section, the Jugendbund, for young men between the ages of 14 and 18 years. Its successor, the Hitler Youth (Hitlerjugend or HJ), remained under SA command until May 1932. Hermann Göring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler. He was given command of the SA as the Oberster SA-Führer in 1923.[15] He was later appointed an SA-Obergruppenführer (general) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945.\n\nFrom April 1924 until late February 1925, the SA was reorganized into a front organization known as the Frontbann to circumvent Bavaria's ban on the Nazi Party and its organs. (This had been instituted after the abortive Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923). While Hitler was in prison, Ernst Röhm helped to create the Frontbann as a legal alternative to the then-outlawed SA. In April 1924, Röhm had also been given authority by Hitler to rebuild the SA in any way he saw fit. When in April 1925 Hitler and Ludendorff disapproved of the proposals under which Röhm was prepared to integrate the 30,000-strong Frontbann into the SA, Röhm resigned from all political movements and military brigades on May 1, 1925. He felt great contempt for the \"legalistic\" path the party leaders wanted to follow and sought seclusion from public life.[16] Throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s, members of the SA were often involved in street fights, called Zusammenstöße (collisions), with members of the Communist Party (KPD). In 1929, the SA added a Motor Corps for better mobility and a faster mustering of units.[17] It also acquired an independent source of funds: royalties from its own Sturm Cigarette Company. Previously, the SA had been financially dependent on the party leadership, as it charged no membership fees;[18][19] the SA recruited particularly among the many unemployed in the economic crisis.[20] The SA used violence against shops and shopkeepers stocking competing cigarette brands; it also punished any SA member caught with non-Sturm cigarettes.[18][19] Sturm marketing was also used to make military service more appealing. Cigarettes were sold with collectible sets of images of historical German army uniforms.[21]\n\nIn September 1930, as a consequence of the Stennes revolt in Berlin, Hitler assumed supreme command of the SA as its new Oberster SA-Führer. He sent a personal request to Röhm, asking him to return to serve as the SA's chief of staff. Röhm accepted this offer and began his new assignment on January 5, 1931. He brought radical new ideas to the SA and appointed several close friends to its senior leadership.\n\nPreviously, the SA formations were subordinate to the Nazi Party leadership of each Gau. Röhm established new Gruppen that had no regional Nazi Party oversight. Each Gruppe extended over several regions and was commanded by a SA-Gruppenführer who answered only to Röhm or Hitler. Under Röhm as its popular leader and Stabschef (Staff Chief), the SA grew in importance within the Nazi power structure and expanded to have thousands of members. In the early 1930s, the Nazis expanded from an extremist fringe group to the largest political party in Germany, and the SA expanded with it. By January 1932, the SA numbered approximately 400,000.[22]\n\nMany of these stormtroopers believed in the strasserist promise of nazism. They expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy, once they obtained national power.[23] By the time Hitler assumed power in January 1933, SA membership had increased to approximately 2,000,000—twenty times as large as the number of troops and officers in the Reichswehr (German Army).[24]\n\nAfter Hitler and the Nazis obtained national power, the SA leadership also became increasingly eager for power. By the end of 1933, the SA numbered more than 3 million men, and many believed they were the replacement for the \"antiquated\" Reichswehr. Röhm's ideal was to absorb the army (then limited by law to no more than 100,000 men) into the SA, which would be a new \"people's army\". This deeply offended and alarmed the professional army leaders and threatened Hitler's goal of co-opting the Reichswehr. The SA's increasing power and ambitions also posed a threat to other Nazi leaders.[25] Originally an adjunct to the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS) was placed under the control of Heinrich Himmler, in part to restrict the power of the SA and their leaders.[26] The younger SS had evolved to be more than a bodyguard unit for Hitler and demonstrated that it was better suited to carry out Hitler's policies, including those of a criminal nature.[27][28]\n\nAlthough some of the conflicts between the SS and SA were based on personal rivalries of leaders, the mass of members had key socio-economic differences and related conflicts. SS members generally came from the middle class, while the SA had its base among the unemployed and working class. Politically speaking, the SA was more radical than the SS, with its leaders arguing the Nazi revolution had not ended when Hitler achieved power, but rather needed to implement Strasserism in Germany. Hitler believed that the defiant and rebellious culture encouraged before the seizure of power had to give way to using these forces for community organization. But the SA members resented tasks such as canvassing and fundraising, considering them Kleinarbeit (\"legwork\"), which had typically been performed by women before the Nazi seizure of power.[29] Rudolf Diels, the first Gestapo chief, estimated that in 1933 Berlin, 70 percent of new SA recruits were former Communists.[30]\n\nIn 1933, General Werner von Blomberg, the Minister of Defence, and General Walter von Reichenau, the chief of the Reichswehr's Ministerial Department, became increasingly concerned about the growing power of the SA. Röhm had been given a seat on the National Defence Council and began to demand more say over military matters. On October 2, 1933, Röhm sent a letter to Reichenau that said: \"I regard the Reichswehr now only as a training school for the German people. The conduct of war, and therefore of mobilization as well, in the future is the task of the SA.\"[31]\n\nBlomberg and von Reichenau began to conspire with Göring and Himmler against Röhm and the SA. Himmler asked Reinhard Heydrich to assemble a dossier on Röhm. Heydrich recognized that for the SS to gain full national power, the SA had to be broken.[32] He manufactured evidence to suggest that Röhm had been paid 12 million marks by French agents to overthrow Hitler. Hitler liked Röhm and initially refused to believe the dossier provided by Heydrich. Röhm had been one of his first supporters and, without his ability to obtain army funds in the early days of the movement, it is unlikely that the Nazis would have ever become established. The SA under Röhm's leadership had also played a vital role in destroying the opposition during the elections of 1932 and 1933.\n\nHitler had his own reasons for wanting Röhm removed. Some of his powerful supporters had been complaining about Röhm for some time. The generals opposed Röhm's desire to have the SA, a force of by then over three million men, absorb the much smaller German Army into its ranks under his leadership.[32] Since the officers had developed the Reichswehr as a professional force of 100,000, they believed that it would be destroyed if merged with millions of untrained SA thugs.[33] Furthermore, the army commanders were greatly concerned about reports of a huge cache of weapons in the hands of SA members.[32] Industrialists, who had provided the funds for the Nazi victory, were unhappy with Röhm's socialistic views on the economy and his claims that the real revolution had still to take place. President Hindenburg informed Hitler in June 1934 that if a move to curb the SA was not forthcoming, he would dissolve the government and declare martial law.[34]\n\nHitler was also concerned that Röhm and the SA had the power to remove him as leader. Göring and Himmler played on this fear by constantly feeding Hitler with new information on Röhm's proposed coup. A masterstroke was to claim that Gregor Strasser, whom Hitler felt had betrayed him, was part of the planned conspiracy against him. With this news, Hitler ordered all the SA leaders to attend a meeting in the Hanselbauer Hotel[35] in Bad Wiessee.\n\nOn June 30, 1934, Hitler, accompanied by SS units, arrived at Bad Wiessee, where he personally placed Röhm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest. Over the next 48 hours, 200 other senior SA officers were arrested on the way to Wiessee. Many were shot and killed as soon as they were captured, but Hitler decided to pardon Röhm because of his past services to the movement. On July 1, after much pressure from Göring and Himmler, Hitler agreed that Röhm should die. Hitler insisted that Röhm should first be allowed to commit suicide. When Röhm refused to do so, he was shot by two SS officers, Theodor Eicke and Michael Lippert.[36] Though the names of 85 victims are known, estimates place the total number killed at between 150 and 200 men, the rest of whom remain unidentified.[37]\n\nSome Germans were shocked by the executions, but many others perceived Hitler to have restored \"order\" to the country. Goebbels' propaganda highlighted the \"Röhm-Putsch\" in the days that followed. The homosexuality of Röhm and other SA leaders was made public to add \"shock value\", although Hitler and other Nazi leaders had known for years about the sexuality of Röhm and other named SA leaders.[38]\n\nAfter the Night of the Long Knives, the SA continued to operate, under the leadership of Stabschef Viktor Lutze, but the group was significantly downsized. Within a year's time, the SA membership was reduced by more than 40%.[37] However, the Nazis increased attacks against Jews in the early 1930s and used the SA to carry these out.\n\nIn November 1938, after the assassination of German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan (a Polish Jew), the SA was used for \"demonstrations\" against the act. In violent riots, members of the SA shattered the glass storefronts of about 7,500 Jewish stores and businesses. The events were referred to as Kristallnacht ('Night of Broken Glass', more literally 'Crystal Night').[39] Jewish homes were ransacked throughout Germany. This pogrom damaged, and in many cases destroyed, about 200 synagogues (constituting nearly all Germany had), many Jewish cemeteries, more than 7,000 Jewish shops, and 29 department stores. Some Jews were beaten to death and more than 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and taken to concentration camps.[40]\n\nThereafter, the SA became overshadowed by the SS; by 1939 it had little remaining significance in the Nazi Party, though it was never formally disbanded and continued to exist until the war ended. In January 1939, the role of the SA was officially established as a training school for the armed forces, with the establishment of the SA Wehrmannschaften (SA Military Units).[41] With the start of World War II in September 1939, the SA lost most of its remaining members to military service in the Wehrmacht (armed forces).[42]\n\nIn January 1941, long-standing rivalries between the Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office) and the SS exploded with the attempted coup d'état in Bucharest that saw SS back the coup by the Iron Guard under its leader Horia Sima against the Prime Minister, General Ion Antonescu, while the Auswärtiges Amt together with the Wehrmacht backed Antonescu. In the aftermath of the coup, the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop made an effort to curb the power of the SS to conduct a foreign policy independent of the Auswärtiges Amt. Taking an advantage of the long-standing rivalries between the SS and the SA, in 1941, Ribbentrop appointed an assemblage of SA men to head the German embassies in Eastern Europe, with Manfred Freiherr von Killinger going to Romania, Siegfried Kasche to Croatia, Adolf-Heinz Beckerle to Bulgaria, Dietrich von Jagow to Hungary, and Hanns Ludin to Slovakia in order to ensure that there would be minimal co-operation with the SS.[43] The role of the SA ambassadors was that of \"quasi-Reich governors\" as they aggressively supervised the internal affairs of the nations they were stationed in, making them very much unlike traditional ambassadors.[44] The SA leaders ambassadors fulfilled Ribbentrop's hopes in that all had distant relations with the SS, but as a group they were notably inept as diplomats with Beckerle being so crude and vulgar in his manners that King Boris III almost refused to allow him to present his credentials at the Vrana Palace.[43] As the ambassador in Bratislava, Ludin arranged the deportation of 50,000 Slovak Jews to Auschwitz in 1942.[45] On 23–24 August 1944, Killinger notably bungled the German response to King Michael I's Coup that saw King Michael I of Romania dismiss Antonescu, sign an armistice with the Allies, and declare war on Germany, thereby costing the Reich its largest source of oil.[46] Of the SA ambassadors, Killinger and Jagow committed suicide in 1944 and 1945 respectively while Kasche and Ludin were executed for war crimes in 1947 in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia respectively. Beckerle spent 11 years in a Soviet POW camp, was released to West Germany in 1955, was charged with war crimes in 1966 for his role in the deportation of Macedonian Jews, which were dropped on grounds of ill health in 1968 and died in 1976 at a retirement home in West Germany.\n\nIn 1943, Viktor Lutze was killed in an automobile accident, and Wilhelm Schepmann was appointed as leader.[47] Schepmann did his best to run the SA for the remainder of the war, attempting to restore the group as a predominant force within the Nazi Party and to mend years of distrust and bad feelings between the SA and SS. On the night of 29–30 March 1945, Austrian SA members were involved in a death march of Hungarian Jews from a work camp at Engerau (modern Petržalka, Slovakia) to Bad Deutsch-Altenburg that saw 102 of the Jews being killed, being either shot or beaten to death.[48] In April 1945, Kreisstabsführer des Kremser Volkssturms (District Chief of Staff of the Krems Militia) and SA-Standartenführer (Colonel of the SA) Leo Pilz led a contingent of Volkssturm militiamen during the Stein Prison massacre, during which 400–500 prisoners were summarily executed.[49] Post-war, Pilz and four others were sentenced to death by the People's Court of Vienna.[50]\n\nThe SA ceased to exist in May 1945 when Nazi Germany collapsed. It was formally disbanded and outlawed by the Allied Control Council enacting Control Council Law No. 2 on October 10, 1945.[51] In 1946, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg formally ruled that the SA was not a criminal organization.[52]\n\nThe leader of the SA was known as the Oberster SA-Führer, translated as Supreme SA-Leader. The following men held this position:\n\nIn September 1930, to quell the Stennes Revolt and to try to ensure the personal loyalty of the SA to himself, Hitler assumed command of the entire organization and remained Oberster SA-Führer for the remainder of the group's existence until 1945. The day-to-day running of the SA was conducted by the Stabschef-SA (SA Chief of Staff), a position Hitler designated for Ernst Röhm.[55] After Hitler's assumption of the supreme command of the SA, it was the Stabschef-SA who was generally accepted as the Commander of the SA, acting in Hitler's name. The following personnel held the position of Stabschef-SA:\n\nThe SA was organized into several large regional Gruppen (\"Groups\"). The group leader answered only to the\nStabschef-SA or Hitler.[57] Each Gruppe was made up of subordinate\nBrigaden (\"Brigades\").[58] Subordinate to the Brigaden were the smaller regiment-sized Standarten.[58] SA-Standarten operated in every major German city and were split into even smaller units, known as Sturmbanne and Stürme.\n\nThe command nexus for the entire SA was the Oberste SA-Führung, located in Stuttgart. The SA supreme command had many sub-offices to handle supply, finance and recruiting.\n\nThe SA also had several military training units. The largest was the SA-Marine, which served as an auxiliary to the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) and performed search and rescue operations as well as harbor defense. The SA also had an \"army\" wing, similar to the Waffen-SS, known as Feldherrnhalle. This formation expanded from regimental size in 1940 to a fully-fledged armored corps (Panzerkorps Feldherrnhalle) in 1945. As for units formed outside of Germany, after the success of the invasion of Poland in 1939, an SA unit, \"Great Government\" was formed. The units were renamed SA Wehrschützen-Bereitschaften in 1942. The title was abbreviated to SA Wehrbereitschaften, thereafter.[59]\n\nIn his 1936 Hitler: A Biography, German historian Konrad Heiden remarked that within the SA ranks, there were \"large numbers of former Communists and Social Democrats\" and that \"many of the storm troops were called 'beefsteaks' – brown outside and red within.\"[60] The influx of non-Nazis into the Sturmabteilung membership was so prevalent that SA men would joke that \"In our storm troop there are three Nazis, but we shall soon have spewed them out.\"[60]\n\nThe number of \"beefsteaks\" was estimated to be large in some cities, especially in northern Germany, where the influence of Gregor Strasser and Strasserism was significant.[61] The head of the Gestapo from 1933 to 1934, Rudolf Diels, reported that \"70 percent\" of the new SA recruits in the city of Berlin had been communists.[30] This is evidenced further by historians, \"As for the prior youth group memberships, nearly half of the SS members and nearly one-third of the instant stormtroopers were with the Free Corps, vigilantes, or militant veterans' groups during their first 25 years of life. They also came in disproportionate numbers from left-wing youth groups such as the Socialist or Communist Youth or the Red Front (RFB).\"[62]\n\nHistorians have argued that since most SA members came from working-class families or were unemployed, they were more amenable to Marxist-leaning socialism, expecting Hitler to fulfill the 25-point National Socialist Program.[63] Historian Thomas Friedrich states that the repeated efforts by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) to appeal to the working-class backgrounds of the SA were \"doomed to failure\", because most SA men were focused on the nationalistic cult of Hitler and destroying the \"Marxist enemy\", a term that was used to identify both the KPD and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).[64]\n\nThe \"beefsteak\" name also referred to party-switching between Nazi and Communist party members, particularly involving those within the SA ranks.\n\nSimilar paramilitary organizations",

The impact is so big, in fact, that for many, finishing Elden Ring means it's time to look for more games like Elden Ring. It combines the essential elements of a Souls game--most notably a combat system with tough enemies and massive bosses that often require careful study and patient play to defeat--with a phenomenally dense, imaginative open world.\n\nIt's that open world that really sets Elden Ring apart from both From Software's other franchises, and most games in general; it's full of fascinating things to discover, encouraging players to set out on their own path of exploration and constantly rewarding them for their efforts.\n\nMore Elden Ring is now here, in the form of Elden Ring Nightreign, a standalone experience set in the Elden Ring world, but deviating pretty significantly from it. Instead of creating a character, you'll choose from specific heroes to play, and instead of venturing across the world mostly alone, you'll take on Nightreign cooperatively with up to two other players.\n\nFor some, a cooperative Elden Ring experience is right up their alley, but if you'd rather have the more lonesome, exploration-heavy, contemplative experience, Nightreign might not be for you. Luckily, there are a ton of other games that are like Elden Ring--those that conjure a similar feeling of setting out into a dark and hostile world, whether through their combat systems, dark and intriguing storytelling, or world design. Below, you'll find 24 RPGs, souls-like games, and open-world games that each capture elements of Elden Ring's gameplay, providing you with more tough battles to fight and incredible worlds to chart. These aren't necessarily meant to be duplicates of what Elden Ring is going for, but games that might appeal to those who like certain elements of it.\n\nAlternatively, we've got suggestions for the best RPGs and the best Elden Ring mods, the latter of which can expand and refresh your experience if you just want more Elden Ring.\n\nSucker Punch’s follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima moves the action up 300 years to the 17th century Ezo, as a female warrior, Atsu, dedicates herself to hunting down the Yotei Six who murdered her family and left her for dead.\n\nWith only two exceptions, Ghost of Yotei lets players choose which of the six she wants to target, and win. The game’s combat and open-world exploration should appeal to Elden Rings players, and this period of Japan’s history has been meticulously recreated. A player can lose themselves going through all of the side missions and finding the hidden secrets. The backgrounds are stunningly beautiful and the game is a worthy successor for the Ghost franchise.\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC\n\nGame Science really elevated their game--so to speak--with Black Myth: Wukong, a beautifully rendered dive into Chinese mythology that loosely adapts Journey to the West. It’s not a fully open-world game, but Elden Ring fans should appreciate its soulslike aspects and the fantastic combat system. The Destined One’s staff turns out to be one of the most versatile weapons in the game, and it has plenty of tricks to master.\n\nThe Destined One is a humanoid monkey who is attempting to free his master from a trap that was set centuries earlier. That quest will take the Destined One across the country and into countless battles with enemies that stand in the way of his goal. Knocking the hell out of them with the staff is a good way to destress, but don’t get complacent. There are always harder battles to get through before the end.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers is another soulslike title with a female warrior at the forefront. Bai Wuchang, however, has access to a deadly arsenal of weapons including multiple swords, dual blades, axes, and spears. If it’s sharp, she can use pretty much anything to kill her foes, and her combat options are like deadly poetry in motion. Even her defensive moves are impressive.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of this game is that Wuchang is infected with a virus that can transform its victims and drive them crazy. Players have to monitor Wuchang’s sanity and take steps to bring her back from the brink. Wuchang’s madness can also be a super power that temporarily makes her much stronger. But if her sanity is nearly depleted, it means her death won’t be far behind.\n\nHell Is Us breaks from the conventions of the other games on this list by setting its story in an alternative present that’s mired in supernatural threats. The main character, Remi, even uses a drone to help him distract his enemies. But when it comes to taking down Hollow Walkers, the old ways are best. That means swords, axes, and other melee weapons are the most effective tactics against these creatures.\n\nRemi’s story takes him back to his war-torn homeland as he attempts to locate the parents that he barely remembers. What he discovers is a deeper mission that will test him every aspect of his being. It turns out you can go home again, but no one ever said anything about leaving alive. The semi-open world around Remi has its own life to it, and he’ll need to talk with other survivors to figure out what he should do.\n\nThough not the first of From Software's games to use the formula, the Dark Souls trilogy crystalized the essential elements that make up Elden Ring, and went on to define an entire subgenre. It's the feel of Dark Souls that informs Elden Ring, as well as so many other games that have come after it. Combat is slow and methodical, requiring you to pick your moments to attack as you learn how to deal with powerful opponents that can easily destroy you if you're not smart and careful. The combination of melee mechanics with a stamina gauge, a health system that gives you a limited quantity of healing items you can continually refill, and a checkpoint system that forces you to choose between replenishing yourself and reviving all the creatures you just defeated, have led to so many games borrowing its ideas that it has given rise to its own genre: the Soulslike.\n\nThe original Dark Souls is really the quintessential game, taking players through tough battles against a variety of fantastical bosses, and features an incredibly interesting and interconnected world. It's not exactly an open-world game--it hides a pretty linear experience--but it feels huge, open, and strange, and the sense of exploring that world is part of what has made Dark Souls so powerfully influential for more than a decade. Dark Souls 2 and 3 expand on and refine the experience in different ways to offer iterations on the theme that are both worth exploring, especially to see how they would eventually give rise to Elden Ring.\n\nFanatical is owned by GameSpot parent company Fandom.\n\nThe Dark Souls games (and Demon's Souls) hew closest to Elden Ring's approach to things like combat and healing. In terms of a vast open world where exploration is just as big a part of the experience as following the prescribed path, however, it's hard to find a better example than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. Both games reimagine the classic Zelda framework of melee combat, dungeon-crawling, and amassing a huge inventory of weapons and tools to make your way in the world, with an expansive open world that gives way to a much more free-form experience. Just as you can set out in any direction in Elden Ring and find a viable path through the game, you can wander both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and chart your own way through Hyrule. You'll be hard-pressed to find any other games that capture Elden Ring's sense of open possibility the way these do.\n\nThe quickest way to understand Remnant 2 would be \"Dark Souls with guns,\" although especially with Remnant 2, that description is a big disservice. Remnant 2 uses key elements of the souls-like formula, like finite healing items that can be replenished, a stamina gauge for dodging away from enemy attacks, and checkpoints that revive enemies in the area around you, but it expands on it in a ton of meaningful ways. Most notably, Remnant 2 makes use of an impressive procedural generation system that mixes in bespoke elements, making unpredictable maps that are filled with intricate, well-designed dungeons. It also has a series of phenomenal, often-massive boss fights, each different from the last and interesting in its own unique way. However, it's in its secrets that Remnant 2 really excels--the procedural generation elements mean you can play the same dungeon over and over and discover new elements each time, like hidden rooms, additional battles, and alternate ways to defeat bosses. The best way to experience Remnant 2 is in co-op, thanks to a system that rewards you for mixing and matching different classes and working together to explore its constantly changing world.\n\nBloodborne takes the more linear approach generally inherent to the Dark Souls games and gives it a faster pace, while setting it in a bloody Lovecraftian horror tale. There's a reason Bloodborne is the favorite of From Software's oeuvre among many fans--it's an often-brilliant iteration on the core ideas. Bloodborne does away with the slower elements of the Souls games, like blocking with a shield, in favor of dodging, parrying, and a health-rally system that rewards you for being aggressive by letting you gain back health lost to enemies by pressing the attack. Even better than that, though, is a dark and twisting story about a plague that turns people into horrific beasts, which you're tasked with stopping as you take part in the blood-drenched Hunt, only to discover that there are forces beyond your comprehension at work in the cursed land of Yharnam.\n\nWhere Bloodborne iterated on From's approach with faster and more aggressive gameplay, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice brought that line of thinking to its ultimate conclusion with a game that demands you never back down from a fight. In Sekiro, every battle is a duel, whether you're fighting a samurai general or a towering ape. It introduces a \"posture\" system, which rewards you for pressing the attack and perfectly parrying your opponent's strikes by staggering them and opening them up for a massive, deadly blow. Sekiro is also From's most narrative-driven game, taking you through a tragic story set during Japan's Sengoku period, and adds stealth mechanics and platforming to the formula to create something unique among From's catalog.\n\nRise of the Ronin takes a stab at combat similar to Elden Ring--it's maybe \n\nIt's tough to think of an open-world RPG without thinking immediately of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Bethesda's incredibly popular game has been ported basically everywhere, and endures more than 10 years later because it puts players in a vast world with a huge amount of things to discover. Defined by first-person combat that includes dual-wielding weapons and magic spells, Skyrim has an absolutely enormous number of things to do and find, and stories to uncover and take part in. It stands as the gold standard of Bethesda's approach to games and has been hugely influential on open-world titles and RPGs ever since. Plus, it has an expansive, robust modding scene on PC that adds to and remakes the game in a phenomenal number of ways, just in case getting lost in the northern reaches of Tamriel for hundreds of hours wasn't enough for you.\n\nA lot of developers have tried to replicate the feel of a From Software Souls game, but none have ever quite managed it. Few have gotten as close as Neowiz Games with Lies of P, though. A riff on the story of Pinnochio, Lies of P is a little bit like if Bloodborne was set a little further in the future and focused on killer clockwork automata instead of werewolf-like monsters, but with a hearty helping of Sekiro's parry-focused approach to combat and weaponry. The game excels in fast-paced dueling combat, especially in its many killer boss fights. It's also set in a dark, fantastical world and explores some fascinating ideas of personhood in between all the beat-downs you give both robots and other \"humans.\"\n\nThe 2018 reboot of God of War reworked its gameplay in some significant ways, not the least of which is a \"wide linear\" focus on exploration that puts you not quite in an open world, but not quite in a fully linear experience, either. That approach provides a lot of Norse mythology-inspired places to explore, where you'll uncover fascinating stories and quite a few tough mythological creatures that need walloping. Reworked combat tightens the series' combo-centric battles against lots of enemies to make for some tougher duels, and God of War and its sequel, Ragnarok, have evolved to be \n\nMortal Shell is an indie souls-like game very obviously inspired by the Dark Souls approach, with a haltingly told story and a dark and shadowy fantasy world. Its tough combat is very similar to what the Souls games turn out, but with a few tweaks that might make it a good introduction to the genre. Two elements define Mortal Shell: the ability to inhabit the bodies of fallen soldiers to take on their different capabilities, kind of like choosing a class, and the ability to \"harden\" your body and tank a hit from an enemy. The harden ability is the key to Mortal Shell's combat, as it allows you to bait your opponent into attacking and then capitalize on the opening their blow bouncing off you creates. Mortal Shell is a smaller-scale souls-like than most, but it does a great job of dialing in on a few key elements that make these games so engaging while fleshing them out very well.\n\nTitanfall and Apex Legends' developer Respawn Entertainment's take on Star Wars is more than a little Souls-y. The series, now two games deep, tells the story of a Jedi hiding out in the aftermath of the Jedi Purge from Revenge of the Sith, before he sets out with a band of misfits to take on the Galactic Empire. Lots of games put you in the role of a Jedi, but Respawn's mixture of souls-like influence does a better job of making that compelling than most--instead of just slicing through everything with your laser sword, you're forced to use skills and reflexes, as well as the Force, as you fight tough duels against opponents ranging from Purge Troopers to Rancors to Sith Inquisitors. The Jedi games also add metroidvania elements and large areas to explore on various planets, scratching your exploration and puzzle-solving itch as well.\n\nIn some ways, Ghost of Tsushima is to Sekiro what Elden Ring is to Dark Souls: It plays in similar ways, but brings elements of Sekiro to an open-world format. Those elements are mainly a big focus on stealth assassinations and intense dueling gameplay. Ghost of Tsushima strikes out in its own direction with an emphasis on fighting stances--using the right stance against the enemy you face is essential to success--but a big focus is on parrying blows and knocking enemies off-guard so you can land your strikes. While its open world is more traditional than Elden Ring's, with lots of characters to talk to and side quests to complete, its minimalist presentation helps it capture that sense of wide-reaching exploration that makes From Software's game so engaging.\n\nThough souls-like games are often defined by their combat, the more effervescent element of the Elden Ring experience is the sense of scale and discovery it can often portray, as you ride over a hill and discover something incredible--often towering in the distance and waiting to kill you. That's the experience of Shadow of the Colossus to a T. You venture into a beautifully realized but ultimately lonely world filled with staggering, enormous monsters--only to destroy them. Shadow of the Colossus nails a sense of vastness that is empty and ponderous, something that also marks the best moments of Elden Ring, and excels at making you feel like you've just stumbled on something ancient and inscrutable. Its minimalist narrative makes the most of that world, as well as its awe-inspiring creatures, to capture a feeling few other games ever manage.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is revered as one of the best open-world RPGs made in the last decade, if not longer. It expands on CD Projekt's Witcher series in just about every way, from placing you in a truly huge game world full of well-told stories and side quests, to deepening combat and exploration. The gist is still the same--you're monster-hunter Geralt, a strong fighter with a handful of impressive special abilities and access to magic powers. And it's in fighting its various monsters that The Witcher 3 really hits a stride, pitting you against fantastical beasts that are all weird, deadly, and challenging in their own ways. Beyond that, though, its world is filled with quests that are worth taking and tales that are worth unfolding. The way The Witcher 3 lets you get to know the world and take part in it, and shows you the beauty and tragedy found within, elevates it beyond most RPGs.\n\nHollow Knight is a pretty big departure from Elden Ring, as games on this list go. It's not a 3D open-world game or an RPG--it's a side-scrolling metroidvania. But like a lot of other games on this list, it nails the sense of exploration through a strange world full of long and sometimes tragic history. It also draws from the souls-like formula for its combat, distilling some of those elements into 2D battles against a huge host of bosses. The combination of tough battles, a dark and expansive world through which you chart your own path, and an incredible amount of atmosphere and intriguing world-building give Hollow Knight a similar feel to what makes Elden Ring so enticing.\n\nThe Horizon games are \n\nOne of the joys of Elden Ring is just setting out in a direction and seeing what's out there. In Dragon's Dogma 2, just about any venture away from the safety of a settlement is met less with fascinating things to discover like hidden caves or underground cities, and more with unpredictable chaos in the form of the various vicious and magical creatures that want to make a meal out of you. The unpredictable ways these systems can interact with each other is the joy of Dragon's Dogma 2--as is hanging out with the miscreant \"pawns,\" companion characters you and other players create. Sharing them with pals you can't join in-game gives Dragon's Dogma a multiplayer feel similar to Elden Ring that goes perfectly with a fun open world where the journey is always as important as the destination.\n\nThe Nioh games were the result of developer Team Ninja combining its pedigree for fast, intense combat with souls-like mechanics. A lot of the familiar elements are present, like your offensive and defensive moves being governed by a stamina system. Team Ninja riffed on that underlying idea, creating an approach to stamina that also works in strategic planning in the midst of combat, along with precise timing, to make sure you can keep your stamina up and survive the onslaught of your foes. With clever bosses and winding level design, the Nioh games take souls-like ideas off in new directions to create some fresh but familiar experiences.\n\nYou'll immediately recognize the souls-like elements in combat in No Rest For The Wicked, with the usual stamina system, dodge-rolls, and parries. The differences are in its presentation: No Rest For The Wicked is an isometric dungeon-crawler, making it feel something like Dark Souls via Diablo. Each new weapon you find offers different move sets that will drastically change your approaches to combat, which offers a lot of variety in battles and gameplay as you take on some tough and often huge bosses. No Rest For The Wicked is set in its own dark fantasy world that's equal parts strange, fascinating, and horrifying, making it very interesting to venture through and fight to survive within.\n\nTeam Ninja riffs on the souls-like formula again in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, but goes in a different direction. It experiments with different ideas, allowing you more opportunities to customize a character and to build into different stats and gameplay approaches as you level up. Choosing different weapons and sets of armor, and hot-swapping between weapons on the fly, lets you change your fighting style whenever you want, offering a lot of versatility for Sekiro-style, parry-heavy battles. Wo Long also makes some interesting tweaks to the souls-like formula--instead of having to run back to where you died in order to reclaim what you lost there, for instance, you now have to face down whatever killed you. The result is a feeling of fighting out a series of battles and duels that have an element of rivalry baked in. Making your way through Wo Long's world isn't just about leveling up, but about staking a claim on each new piece of the map, turning exploration into a system that makes you stronger.\n\nDrawing inspirations from both From Software's games and Team Ninja's Nioh series, The First Berserker: Khazan does what those games do well: intense fights against huge, intense bosses. Khazan will scratch the itch for difficult combat against interesting enemies, especially with its unique art style and weapon-specific upgrade trees that give you incentives to lean into a specific combat style. The game is also part of the Dungeon & Fighter universe, so while it won't give you a huge open world full of lore to explore, there are deeper narrative underpinnings to intrigue fans of the franchise.\n\nInstead of going to the past or to a fantastical world, The Surge 2 takes place in a dystopian sci-fi future. Rogue robots threaten the world, and you'll face a variety of enemies both human and mechanical in a bid for survival. The Surge 2's melee combat adds a new dimension to the usual souls-like formula by allowing you to hack off specific limbs or parts of your foes in order to loot their weapons, armor, or items. If you're looking for an action-RPG that goes the apocalyptic future route rather than toward fantasy tropes, The Surge 2 will give you a whole new ruined world to explore.\n\nIf you're looking for more story and anime influence in your souls-like, Code Vein has you covered. Set in a world ravaged by a cataclysm that has resurrected the dead as vampire-like people called Revenants, you play an amnesiac character with a special ability--where other Revenants have what is essentially a single class called a Blood Code, you're able to compile and swap between many different Blood Codes and the special abilities that come with them. You'll use your vampiric powers to battle other Revenants after they've transformed into hideous monsters in an effort to save those who remain from a similar fate.\n\nWhile Diablo's combat is more oriented toward managing special abilities and cooldowns than it's geared toward dealing with stamina and parries, there's still a lot of similar DNA between it and Elden Ring. The Diablo series originated the RPG loot chase that defines so many games these days, and there's plenty of mechanical satisfaction in constantly chasing greater power. Diablo IV's story and world also play up the horror elements that often infuse Elden Ring, giving you a strange and terrible world to explore, along with massive, challenging bosses to defeat.",

    "fullText": "Raiders, Guardians, Executors, and Revenants are going to be more powerful after the latest Nightreign update.\n\nIf you've been hoping for some sweeping balance changes among the Nightfarers in Elden Ring: Nightreign, then the day has arrived. From Software has released a new Nightreign Version 1.03.2 update that re-balances some of the weaker Nightfarers into more formidable heroes across all consoles and PC versions of the game.\n\nAs laid out on the official page for Elden Ring, Guardians received a damage negation buff as well as an increase to the Guard Boost ability. Raiders now have faster attacks with the exception of jump attacks of dual-wield attacks. Additionally, Raiders' attack range is extended when using the Ultimate Art \"Totem Stela.\"\n\nRevenants are getting more attack power when using the Ultimate Art \"Immortal March\" or the \"Summon Spirit\" skill. Executors got the most love from this update, with increased attack power, guard boost, stagger damage, and reduced stamina reduction when using the \"Cursed Sword\" character skill. Executors also received a handful of other buffs as well.\n\nThis update was primarily focused on balance adjustments for Relics, Equipment, Sorcery, and Incantations, as well as a long list of bug fixes that went with them. This is one of the biggest updates Nightreign has received since The Forsaken Hollows DLC launched last month. If you need help navigating the DLC's new characters and new bosses, check out GameSpot's guide to starting The Forsaken Hollows.\n\nYou can find the full patch notes for the new update below.\n\n*This addresses an intended bug where the increased effect of the \"Improved ●● Attack Power\" and \"Improved Attack Power with 3+ ●● Equipped\" Relic Effects in Patch 1.03 were mistakenly applied to the bow weapon category.\n\n*This adjustment applies to Expeditions when matched only with players who also own the DLC.\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "title": "Suspended Ford Worker Who Was Flipped Off By Trump Made So Much Money On GoFundMe He Paused Donations",
    "description": "Two six-figure crowdfunding campaigns saw thousands of individual donations for the Ford factory worker.",
    "fullText": "President Trump giving the middle-finger to a Ford employee who apparently calls it like he sees it seems to be the best thing that has ever happened to him — financially at least. TJ Sabula, a 40-year old United Auto Workers Local 600 line worker, was quickly suspended with pay by Ford after heckling the President while he was visiting one of its factories in Michigan (the President, in turn, flipped him the bird and apparently mouthed \"F**k you.\") But, soon after, a pair of GoFundMe pages were set up for Sabula and they took off like wildfire.\n\nAs of mid-morning on January 15, the pair of campaigns for Sabula have raised $811,010 from nearly 35,000 separate donations. Sabula, seeming to be a stand-up guy, actually decided to stop accepting donations, indicating he and his family had more than enough.\n\nIn an update on one of the pages, Sabula wrote, \"We greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support. We appreciate every single donation, comment, share, and sign of support!\" The other page had a similar message and said it was also closing donations. I'm not sure I'm big enough to ever stop taking free money, but good for him.\n\nOf course, Trump didn't just pick a random guy out of the crowd to cuss out, though it wouldn't be that surprising. Sabula reportedly called Trump a \"pedophile protector\" during his visit to the Michigan F-150 factory. The Department of Justice faces criticisms as to the speed it has released the Epstein files–along with the redactions being made to the documents–which must be made public in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nIn any case, as we previously reported, Trump's White House didn't try to cover up or downplay what the President did, instead telling the Washington Post that \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"\n\nSabula told The Post that he has \"no regrets whatsoever,\" though he did add that he feels concerned about the future of his job and believes he has been \"targeted for political retribution\" for \"embarrassing Trump in front of his friends.\"\n\nIt's still unclear what Sabula's future with Ford will be, but at the very least the $800,000+ he's gotten from GoFundMe will help lighten the blow. On top of that, he's got the backing of the UAW. The union posted this on its website:\n\nThe autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union —the UAW. He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\n\nThe UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member. Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone—including the President of the United States.\n\nThat's certainly the type of union representation we all deserve.\n\nSabula has also received support from U.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, who represents Detroit, calling him a \"national hero,\" according to the Detroit Free Press. Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation and fellow Michigander Pete Buttigieg has also voiced his support.\n\nNot everyone was on board, though, including Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford, who earlier in the visit said meeting the president was \"the experience of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Discipline is in the hands of the organization. It's unfortunate and 99% of the employees in the plant were great and I was embarrassed because we're the host. But that was six seconds out of an hour tour and the tour went great.\"\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns can often get people all riled up about someone being rewarded for \"bad behavior\": In early 2025, a woman in Minnesota was caught calling a child a racist slur on a playground and then made over $800,000 on GoFundMe-alike site GiveSendGo, according to NBC News. That woman was charged with three counts of disorderly conduct by the City of Rochester, with a trial set to begin in August 2026, ABC 6 News reports.\n\nWant more like this?

    "description": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "fullText": "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 \n\nBut some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket — roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap — could save as much as $1,320 per person.\n\n\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 — that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"\n\nThe $670 figure is based on a 2025 analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.\n\nThe tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.\n\n\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"\n\nAARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.\n\nWho qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?\n\nPeople who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction, according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.\n\nThe tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.\n\nThe deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.\n\nIndividuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",

    "description": "Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez explains why a new wave of earnings from the semiconductor sector signals the AI race is just warming up.",
    "fullText": "The AI supercycle is far from exhausted, and semiconductor companies like industry titan TSMC (TSM) are among the catalysts to watch.\n\n\"This earnings report, really more than anything, supports the idea that [the AI boom] is going to continue to move forward,\" Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nAccording to Fernandez, the great \"rotation\" out of Big Tech might finally \"start to slow down a little bit.\" While market skeptics spent the past quarter betting on a broad exit from the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a new wave of earnings from the semiconductor sector signals \"there are more legs\" to the AI race.\n\nOther key players to watch include ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Lam Research (LRCX), as Fernandez points to the firms' respective \"strong earnings.\"\n\nThat renewed optimism is largely due to a fundamental shift in how the market views the picks and shovels of the AI era. For months, investors feared that AI demand might be a bubble nearing its burst. However, the latest data from these four companies — which build the hardware for Big Tech — tells a different story of rising capital expenditures, expanding margins, and relentless sales growth.\n\nLeading that charge is TSMC, the world's most critical chip foundry, which dominates advanced chip production for giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nTSMC kicked off the new year by delivering blockbuster Q4 earnings today. For the period, revenue came in at $33.73 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase, beating consensus estimates of $32.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Earnings per share reached $3.15, up 8% year over year, surpassing the expected $2.90. TSMC stock has risen over 70% in the past year.\n\nThe company announced it had earmarked up to $56 billion in capital expenditures for 2026. This aggressive spending plan acts as a massive \"buy\" signal for the entire supply chain, per Fernandez, suggesting that the world's biggest tech players are doubling down on infrastructure, rather than pulling back.\n\nThe higher-for-longer spending cycle has revitalized the three other key suppliers. Take ASML, the sole provider of the lithography machines required to make advanced AI chips. Its market cap surged past the $500 billion mark on the back of TSMC's news. Shares of ASML are up over 80% in the past 12 months.\n\nThe support for these suppliers was visible in premarket trading, where Applied Materials and Lam Research shares were up 8% and 6%, respectively. These companies represent the infrastructure layer that must be built before any software-based AI gains can be realized.",

    "fullText": "SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt absolutely lost it on The Hill’s Niall Stanage on Thursday after he accused the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee Good of acting “recklessly.”\n\nThe exchange began with a query from Stanage:\n\nYou were just defending ICE agents generally, and earlier on Secretary Noem spoke to the media and she said among other things that they are doing everything correctly. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, 170 U.S. citizens were detained by ICE, and Renee Good was shot in the head and killed by an ICE agent. How does that equate to them doing everything correctly?\n\nLeavitt responded with a question of her own: “Why was Renee Good unfortunately and tragically killed?”\n\n“Are you asking me my opinion?” asked Stanage before giving his answer: “Because an ICE agent acted recklessly and killed her unjustifiably.”\n\n“Oh, okay, so you’re a biased reporter with a left-wing opinion,” shot back Leavitt, which prompted Stanage to wonder, “What do you want me to do?”\n\nYeah, because you’re left-wing hack! You’re not a reporter, you’re posing in this room as a journalist, and it’s so clear by the premise of your question. And you and the people in the media who have such biases, but fake like you’re journalists, you shouldn’t even be sitting in that seat. But you’re pretending like you’re a journalist, but you’re a left-wing activist, and the question that you just raised and your answer proves your bias.\n\nYou should be reporting on the facts. You should be reporting on cases. Do you have the numbers of how many American citizens were killed at the hands of illegal aliens who ICE is trying to remove from this country? I bet you don’t. I bet didn’t even read up on those stories. I bet, you never even read about Laken Riley, or Jocelyn Nungaray, or all of the innocent Americans who were killed at the hands of illegal aliens in this country. And the brave men and women of ICE are doing everything in their power to remove those heinous individuals and make our communities safer. And shame on people like you in the media who have a crooked view, and have a biased view, and pretend like you’re a real honest journalist.\n\nThe post ‘You’re a Left-Wing Hack!’ Karoline Leavitt EXPLODES on Columnist Who Accused ICE Agent Who Shot Renee Good of Acting ‘Recklessly’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "One man is recalling a fight for his life that all started with a tiny mosquito.\n\nIn 2007, Glendale, Arizona, resident David Hancock started feeling very sick with a sudden fever and vomiting. By the time he made it to the hospital, it took doctors 10 days to diagnose him. In the meantime, he fell into a coma, suffered heart failure, his lungs filled with fluid, and his brain became inflamed.\n\n\"I was on the other side, with one foot in the other world,\" he told Deutsche Welle, which summarized his experience with West Nile virus, a disease that can be transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite.\n\nWhile most people who contract West Nile virus may never know it, one in five will experience body aches and other flu-like symptoms, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Others, like Hancock, suffer much more worrisome outcomes. Each year, more than 1,300 Americans who have contracted West Nile develop severe illness that affects the central nervous system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 130 of those end up dying, the agency adds.\n\nMeanwhile, cases of West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, and Zika are increasing, as rising global temperatures help mosquitoes to move into new territories and lengthen their active seasons. Many U.S. localities experienced surges in West Nile virus this year: Bell County in Texas reported six positive tests in six weeks, a spike in cases in one part of Utah led to one death, and the number of cases reported across the country in September was 40% higher than usual.\n\nOne of the most important things that anyone can do to avoid getting sick is to prevent mosquito bites. The CDC recommends using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellants; wearing long, loose-fitting clothing when you're outside and treating it with permethrin; and taking measures to control mosquitoes inside and outside the home.\n\nMany agencies assist with mosquito control efforts by spraying throughout local communities when needed. Some cities and counties are taking a more creative approach to mosquito control, too. For instance, one Florida county is using X-rays to sterilize male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This species can carry a number of mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue and Zika.\n\nHow bad are the mosquitoes in your area?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Kyrsten Sinema divided Democrats during her time in the U.S. Senate. Now she’s accused of dividing a husband and wife, too.\n\nThe former Arizona senator is accused of having an extramarital affair with her bodyguard while in office—an alleged relationship that ultimately led to the collapse of a 14-year marriage, according to a federal lawsuit filed by the bodyguard’s ex-wife.\n\nFiled in North Carolina, the suit alleges that Sinema, 49, engaged in lengthy, sultry text exchanges with her former bodyguard, Matthew Ammel, including sending photos of herself wrapped in a towel and suggesting that he bring MDMA on a work trip so she could “guide him through a psychedelic experience.”\n\nHeather Ammel, Matthew’s ex-wife, is suing Sinema for alienation of affection, a controversial North Carolina law that allows a person to be held liable for malicious interference in a marriage.\n\nRoughly a year after Matthew joined Sinema’s security detail, the head of her security team departed and warned him that Sinema “was having sexual relations with other security members,” according to the complaint.\n\nHeather alleges that Matthew suffered from mental health challenges stemming from his service in the U.S. Army, and that Sinema exploited his vulnerability to grow closer to him—at one point promising to “help him” work through his struggles. Heather says she later discovered scores of sexually charged messages between Matthew and the prominent centrist Democrat on the encrypted messaging app Signal. Sinema announced in March 2024 that she would not seek re-election.\n\nThe lawsuit further claims that Sinema paid for Matthew’s psychedelic treatments, brought him to a wedding, and showered him with gifts: took him on international vacations, to a Taylor Swift concert, and allegedly purchased a Theragun so she could “work on his back.”\n\nIn June 2024, Sinema allegedly offered Matthew a paid staff position in her Senate office as a Defense and National Security fellow, where he worked as her subordinate.\n\nAround that time, Heather says she confronted Sinema after seeing a message on Matthew’s phone that read: “I miss you. Putting my hand on your heart. I’ll see you soon.”\n\nHeather responded directly, writing: “are you having an affair with my husband? You took a married man away from his family.”\n\n“Prior to [Sinema’s] deliberate interference in the marriage, genuine love and affection existed between [the couple],” the lawsuit states.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Sinema’s representatives for comment. Matthew Ammel could not be reached for comment.\n\nMatthew filed for divorce earlier this month, TheAssemblyNC reported.\n\nDuring her Senate tenure, Sinema was known as a centrist Democrat whose closest relationships in Congress were often with Republicans rather than members of her own party. She frequently drew criticism from the left, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told Stephen Colbert, “I will not miss Senator Sinema,” after she announced she would not seek reelection.\n\nSinema, now a political adviser at D.C. law firm Hogan Lovells, cited frustration with the state of American politics as one reason for her decision, saying: “Despite modernizing our infrastructure, ensuring clean water, delivering good jobs and safer communities, Americans still choose to retreat farther to their partisan corners.” She added that compromise had become a “dirty word.”",

    "fullText": "A shriek broke the dawn on the savannah, followed by more screeches and the rustle of branches: The wild Fongoli chimps were bidding each other good morning in the dry, scraggly Sahel.\n\nThe rare chimpanzees -- who live in the bush of hot, southeast Senegal rather than the forest as is more common -- exist on the extreme edge of what is possible for their species.\n\nTheir unusual way of living offers clues into humans' own evolutionary past, while their adaptations to the heat appear timely in a world where temperatures are on the rise.\n\nSoaking in pools, cooling off in caves and even wielding spears: The 35 wild chimps of the Fongoli community have adapted to the environment with behaviours that defy their species' conventional norms.\n\nNow, 25 years after starting her pioneering research on savannah chimps, which had never before been habituated to observers, primatologist Jill Pruetz has a wealth of data.\n\nThe study's longevity allows for a deeper dive into the Fongoli community's behaviours, relationships and how they learn from one generation to the next.\n\n\"Until they were habituated to observers so we could follow them around and take data, we only knew chimpanzees from forested areas,\" Pruetz told AFP reporters, who spent two days following her and her team as they tracked the primates in the bush.\n\nThe Fongoli chimps, who live on a 100-square-kilometre (40-square-mile) home range, are only one group of savannah chimps in the region but for years the only one to be studied.\n\nOn a recent morning, A.J., Raffy, Diouf and ambitious young Pistache sat at the top of a baobab, plucking a breakfast of fruit that they cracked open with a whack-whack-whack against the branches.\n\nScreeching, or \"pant-hooting\" as their vocalisations are known, they communicated with other members nearby.\n\nPruetz and her team of Senegalese researchers follow the group's adult males, which currently number 10, choosing one each day to track from dawn to dusk. The females, however, are not followed in order to keep them more wary of poachers.\n\nThe males' strict hierarchy spans from Cy, the alpha, down to Siberut, the oldest and lowest ranking despite his superb hunting skills.\n\nSince the social apes spend much of their time together, Pruetz is still able to observe the females and their young.\n\nIt is the females who have proven the most groundbreaking members of the clan: They are the only non-human animal to systematically use tools to hunt.\n\nIt is a behaviour Pruetz and her researchers have observed almost 600 times.\n\nAfter whittling sticks into spears, usually with their teeth, the females hunt bush babies during the rainy season, impaling the small primates as they shelter in tree holes.\n\nWith the heat index reaching 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in the hot season, life on the savannah can be gruelling.\n\nThe Fongoli chimps \"have to deal with the hottest area that we've studied chimps in\" Pruetz said, and must \"minimise energy expenditure\" during the dry season.\n\nThey are the only wild chimps in the world known to soak, taking dips in natural pools. They additionally \"use caves to rest in, because the caves are cooler\", Pruetz told AFP.\n\nThe savannah woodlands that are the Fongoli chimps' habitat are similar to those that human ancestors lived in some six or seven million years ago.\n\nWhile the Fongoli chimps' many adaptations mean they are able to deal with \"high heat stress\", Pruetz said, \"we're not sure that with climate change they can continue to do that\".\n\nThe Fongoli apes are members of the critically endangered subspecies of West African chimpanzees.\n\nWhile they have traditionally co-existed alongside humans on their home range, a new threat has emerged: a gold rush which has ushered an increase in both artisanal and industrial mines.\n\nIn the morning, the rumble of rock-grinding machines, which crush through buckets of substrate, could be heard before the savannah's fauna began its daily chorus.\n\nFires burned at artisanal mine sites, where night guards watched over equipment.\n\nMines can mean water pollution, greater resource extraction and the spread of human disease to chimps.\n\nPapa Ibnou Ndiaye, a wildlife researcher and professor at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, said studying the Fongoli chimpanzees allows \"the local administration to have accurate information to make informed decisions for the conservation of Senegal's biodiversity\".\n\nPruetz spends part of the year teaching at Texas State University, while her four research assistants and project manager, who are originally from nearby villages, continue to track the apes.\n\nThey keep count as Raffy whacks a baobab fruit eight times or note which arm he uses to do so -- although chimps are normally left-handed.\n\nBut they also meticulously track the chimps' friendships and social plights.\n\n\"When someone gets home from being out with the chimps all day, you sit around the supper table and you talk about, what drama? What did Cy do today? What did Pistache do today?\" said Pruetz, who has images of three of the chimp group's deceased or disappeared members tattooed on her arm.\n\nChimpanzees can live up to 50 years in the wild and how their \"relationships change\" is just one of the many interests for Pruetz.",

Video appears to show federal immigration agents shouting commands over a cacophony of whistles, car horns and screams from protesters.\n\nIn the video, one masked agent smashes Rahman's passenger side window while others cut her seatbelt and drag her out of the car through the driver's side door. Numerous guards then carried her by her arms and legs towards an ICE vehicle.\n\n“I'm disabled trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I didn't move,” Rahman said, gesturing down the street as officers pulled her arms behind her back.\n\nRahman was caught in a “terrible and confusing position” and had “no where to go,” according to Alexa Van Brunt, Rahman's attorney and director of the MacArthur Justice Center.\n\n“Her only options were to move her car forward in the direction of ICE officers and risk being accused of trying to harm them—which led to Renee Good’s death—or stay stationary, which in the end led to physical violence and abuse,” Van Brunt wrote in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security disputed that account in an emailed statement on Thursday, saying that Rahman was an agitator who “ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene.” She was arrested along with six other people the department called agitators, one of whom was accused of jumping on an officer's back.\n\nThe department did not specify if Rahman was charged or respond to questions about her assertion that she was denied medical treatment.\n\nBarrage of viral videos draw scrutiny\n\nThe video of Rahman's arrest is one of many that have garnered millions of views in recent days — and been scrutinized amid conflicting accounts from federal officials and civilian eyewitnesses.\n\nOften, what's in dispute pertains to what happened just before or just after a given recording. But many contain common themes: Protesters blowing whistles, yelling or honking horns. Immigration officers breaking vehicle windows, using pepper spray on protesters and warning observers not to follow them through public spaces. Immigrants and citizens alike forcibly pulled from cars, stores or homes and detained for hours, days or longer.\n\nIn one video, heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of Garrison Gibson’s Minneapolis home, where his wife and 9-year-old child also were inside. The video shot inside the home captures a woman’s voice asking, “Where is the warrant?” and, “Can you put the guns down? There is kids in this house.”\n\nAnother video shows ICE agents, including Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, detain two employees at a Target store in Richfield, Minnesota. Both are U.S. citizens who were later released, according to social media posts from family members.\n\nMonica Bicking, 40, was leaving the homeless shelter where she works as a nurse when she took a video that appears to show a federal agent kneeing a man at least five times in the face while several other agents pin him facedown on the pavement in south Minneapolis.\n\nBicking works full time, so she says she doesn’t intentionally attend organized protests or confrontations with ICE. But she has started to carry a whistle in case she encounters ICE agents on her way to work or while running errands, which she says has become commonplace in recent weeks.\n\n“We’re hypervigilant every time we leave our houses, looking for ICE, trying to protect our neighbors, trying to support our neighbors, who are now just on lockdown,” Bicking said.\n\nRahman said in her statement that after her detainment, she felt lucky to be alive.\n\n“Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled,\" Rahman said.\n\nWhile in custody, Rahman said she repeatedly asked for a doctor, but was instead taken to the detention center.\n\n“It was not until I lost consciousness in my cell that I was finally taken to a hospital,” Rahman said.\n\nRahman was treated for injuries consistent with assault, according to her counsel, and has been released from the hospital.\n\nShe thanked the emergency department staff for their care.\n\n“They gave me hope when I thought I was going to die.”",

    "fullText": "Ashley St. Clair, who gave birth to one of Elon Musk's sons in 2024, sued Musk's xAI in a New York court on Thursday, alleging that its chatbot Grok generated sexually explicit deepfake images of her at users' request.\n\nIn the complaint, St. Clair, a writer, influencer, and political strategist, claims X users prompted Grok to manipulate images of her, including photos from when she was 14, into graphic sexual content. She alleges some images remained online for more than a week and that her premium X account was later terminated after she complained.\n\nShe is also requesting a temporary restraining order to compel xAI to immediately cease from \"the intentional disclosure of nonconsensual intimate images.\"\n\nxAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Grok first promised Ms. St. Clair that it would refrain from manufacturing more images unclothing her,\" the complaint read. \"Instead, Defendant retaliated against her, demonetizing her X account and generating multitudes more images of her,\" the suit alleged.\n\nSt. Clair is also involved in a separate suit with Musk over the custody of their son, in which she sought sole custody.\n\nxAI responded the same day with a separate lawsuit, arguing that St. Clair agreed to its terms of service, which requires any litigation to be heard in Texas. St. Clair is represented by attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specializes in cases involving abuse and has represented clients against Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\"xAI is not a reasonably safe product,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm.\"\n\nThe lawsuit followed international backlash against the Grok chatbot for its ability to undress images of real people and create sexualized images without their consent at users' request.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia blocked access to Grok, while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called explicit images generated by Grok \"disgusting\" and \"shameful\" in a meeting with the House of Commons.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta also announced that his office is investigating the \"non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online\" of \"women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations.\"\n\nX said on the same day in a blog post that users would no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on the platform, adding that the restriction \"applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Business Insider reporter Henry Chandonnet found that it is still \"surprisingly easy\" to prompt Grok to create nude images of him by going to the app itself instead of using the Grok chatbot on X.",

    "description": "Macron said that Ukraine was previously \"overwhelmingly dependent\" on US intelligence, but that France is now providing \"two-thirds\" of that service.",
    "fullText": "French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that his country has now overtaken the US as the main provider of intelligence to Ukraine.\n\n\"Where Ukraine was overwhelmingly dependent on American intelligence capacity, a year ago, two-thirds is today provided by France. Two-thirds,\" Macron said in a New Year's speech to the French military.\n\nThe French leader's comments indicate a shift in the dynamics of Western contributions to the war and suggest that the US may have scaled back its military relationship with Ukraine.\n\nThe US briefly suspended intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine in March 2025, as the Trump administration was attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow. After roughly a week, Washington said it was lifting the suspension.\n\nBut it's been unclear so far whether the Pentagon has continued to provide intelligence at the same level as it did during the Biden administration.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that, in those years, US-Ukrainian intelligence-sharing ties had been so close that officials from both countries worked in the same facility to coordinate military strikes.\n\nOne of the most vital roles played by US intelligence at the time was providing targeting data and situational awareness for Ukrainian troops, especially when the latter were using American-made systems for the attacks.\n\nUkraine has since been trying to develop its own strike capabilities, including long-range precision missiles, that might allow it to strike Russia without Western approval.\n\nIt's also unclear exactly how Macron quantified two-thirds of Ukrainian intelligence capabilities. His speech did not say whether he was referring to two-thirds of the intelligence provided by Ukraine's foreign partners or to two-thirds of all the intelligence used by Ukraine's forces.\n\nThe Élysée Palace and French defense ministry did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours. Ukraine's defense ministry and the Pentagon have also not responded to similar requests for comment on Macron's remarks.\n\nThe French president's point on intelligence-sharing with Ukraine aligns with his larger push to position Paris as a regional military leader, while the Trump administration seeks to curb American involvement in Europe. President Donald Trump has also recently rattled European leaders by alluding that the US could try to take over Greenland, a Danish territory.\n\nMacron said on Thursday that France had helped Ukraine to rebuild its forces and provided Kyiv with security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire.\n\nLast week, European NATO members and the US issued a declaration that said willing countries would form a multinational, \"European-led\" force to provide \"reassurances\" to Ukraine and stave off a second Russian invasion or attack.\n\n\"The signal sent to our Ukrainian partners, to other Europeans, and to the world is that we are ready,\" Macron said. \"We are ready to sustain this effort of resistance. We are ready to deter new aggressions or to maintain peace on our soil.\"",

    "description": "Motolani Adedipe moved to South Korea for a year on a Fulbright scholarship. She brought her two kids along while her husband remained in the US.",
    "fullText": "When Motolani Adedipe moved from Oklahoma to Seoul, South Korea, in August, she didn't just pack her suitcase — she brought along her 6-year-old daughter, newborn baby, and mom.\n\nAdedipe, who is from Nigeria and moved to the US to attend grad school in Texas, first grew curious about South Korea while interning at a biotech firm in Boston, where she shared an apartment with a Korean roommate.\n\n\"For that summer, I ate a lot of Korean food. She put me on K-dramas,\" Adedipe, now 39, told Business Insider. That early curiosity soon grew into an interest in Korea's history, economy, and language.\n\nAdedipe began learning Korean nine years ago online and continued after she moved to Oklahoma for work, where she became an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.\n\nIn September 2024, Adedipe applied for a Fulbright scholarship to extend her research in prostate cancer survivorship. She already knew she wanted to go to South Korea — even as she prepared to give birth to her second child that November.\n\nShe made it through the first review in December, but when months passed with no update, she figured she hadn't made it. So when the acceptance came through in April, the moment felt surreal.\n\n\"It was like the best news and almost the worst news at the same time. Best because finally I get to do this. But of course, the anxiety, how do we start planning now?\" Adedipe said.\n\nThankfully, her family was supportive, especially her husband.\n\n\"It required faith, sacrifice, structure, and for both of us to really imagine a life that looked very different from what we had planned,\" she said.\n\nHer physician husband couldn't accompany her to South Korea, but they agreed that she would bring both daughters along.\n\n\"How many of her peers would ever say, 'Oh, I took a gap year in Korea'?\" she said, referring to their 6-year-old.\n\nKnowing the scholarship would last just one year made the decision easier. Her husband has visited them in South Korea several times and plans to make more trips over the coming months.\n\n\"I saw it as an opportunity for my children to experience another culture, language, and way of life, while still having a clear sense of return,\" Adedipe said.\n\nNow, she homeschools her daughter in the morning before sending her to a \"hagwon,\" a type of private academy that many Korean students attend after school.\n\n\"Not all of her friends speak English, so they kind of communicate through play,\" she said.\n\nAdedipe's mom, who had traveled to Oklahoma to help out with the kids, joined them in Seoul.\n\nAs she searched for housing, Adedipe had a long checklist: enough space for her family, easy access to the subway, flat streets her mother, in her early 60s, could navigate, and a neighborhood that felt safe for kids.\n\nShe found a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in Mapo-gu, a district in western Seoul home to several universities.\n\nAlthough the apartment was smaller than she initially hoped for, it turned out to be a great fit: It's surrounded by greenery and about a 30-minute commute to her workplace.\n\nHer scholarship includes a housing stipend that covers her rent, which she declined to share.\n\nPer the latest December data from the Korea Real Estate Board, the median monthly rent for an apartment in Mapo-gu is 1.39 million Korean won, or about $940.\n\nAdedipe says her schedule varies from week to week, but her work typically starts in the afternoons. She goes into her office at Seoul National University Hospital several times a week, while continuing to supervise her lab in Oklahoma remotely at night.\n\nData from the Ministry of Justice showed that the number of foreigners living in South Korea at the end of 2024 stood at 2.65 million, a 5.7% increase from the previous year.\n\nA US veteran who had retired in South Korea previously told Business Insider that he appreciated the country's safety and culture of respect. Meanwhile, a millennial who moved from Switzerland to Seoul said she valued the convenience of city life, including how most stores stay open late.\n\nOne of the biggest adjustments, Adedipe said, has been the extent to which technology is deeply woven into daily life in Seoul. Nearly everything is tied to having a registered phone number.\n\n\"Once I got my card and I got a bank account and I got a phone number that was registered, life became easy,\" she said.\n\nEven though the city is known for its fast-paced lifestyle, Adedipe says she's been surprised by its human side.\n\n\"I lost my stylus in the bus, and I was able to get it back. It was tagged, and they verified they found it. That could never happen in the US,\" she said.\n\nWatching her daughter flourish and adapt to their life in Seoul has been especially meaningful.\n\n\"Now that I'm seeing where she's shining. My goal is to keep encouraging her to find her passion in life and do that,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to learning Korean, her daughter takes part in extracurricular activities, such as piano, inline skating, and Taekwondo.\n\n\"She's doing everything that I never could have been able to give her because in Oklahoma, if you're doing all those classes, you have to drive your kids to all those classes,\" she said. \"But here in Korea, because of how the education is structured, she does all of that in a school, and she loves it.\"\n\nLiving abroad with her mother has brought them closer. After leaving Nigeria for the US in her 20s, Adedipe went nearly eight years without seeing her mom because of visa issues.\n\n\"And now that I get to live with her again, it's like a dream come true,\" she said.\n\nLooking back on her own experience, Adedipe says living and working in South Korea has felt like a \"full circle moment,\" after years of interest in the country.\n\n\"It felt like all the pieces of my life — research, storytelling, culture, and well-being — were suddenly being invited into the same room,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

    "fullText": "Cubs could move Matt Shaw to the outfield after Alex Bregman signing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs have been aggressive in recent weeks, trading for Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera and signing former Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox infielder Alex Bregman to a five-year $175 million contract.\n\nIf the Cubs retain Nico Hoerner, there won't be space for Matt Shaw to play everyday in the infield. That said, Chicago Cubs president Jed Hoyer proposed a different solution.\n\nAccording to Jesse Rogers of ESPN, Hoyer hinted at the idea of playing Shaw in the outfield in order to get in the lineup more often.\n\nAlthough he doesn't have big league experience in the outfield, right field seems to be the best fit. Pete Crow-Armstrong and Ian Happ are known to play exceptional defense in both center and right field. Happ has won four consecutive Gold Glove awards while Crow-Armstrong won his first last season.\n\nAssuming Kyle Tucker departs in free agency, Shaw could split time with Seiya Suzuki in right. Suzuki only made 48 appearances in the outfield last season, but posted negative two defensive runs saved at the position in 2024.\n\nShaw splitting time at the position could relieve Suzuki from time to time and keep him in a more comfortable position at designated hitter. He excelled in this role last season, hitting a career-high 32 home runs and driving in 103 runs.\n\nEither way, Shaw could get time at second base if Hoerner is traded, something that Chicago has yet to take off the table.\n\nNevertheless, adding the outfield to his repertoire will make him a more versatile piece for the Cubs moving forward.\n\nPhillies linked to slugger with over 200 career home runs\n\nGiants linked to add Marlins' starter via trade\n\nGiants reveal contract guarantees and bonuses for new starter Tyler Mahle\n\nAthletics agree to extension with Tyler Soderstrom after breakout season\n\nAthletics eye rotation upgrades after Jeff McNeil trade\n\nHa-Seong Kim returns to the Braves on a one-year contract\n\nSan Francisco has 'checked in on' Cody Bellinger amid free agency",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots and Houston Texans will look to bring themselves one step closer to ultimate glory in their divisional round matchup on Sunday.\n\nI’ve put together the keys to victory for both sides:\n\nThe Texans’ defensive style is legitimately fascinating, as they ranked first in total defensive EPA (-130.69) and points allowed per game (16.7) while also ranking dead last in blitz rate (21.6%) and simulated pressure rate (29.7%) — all while playing more man-coverage (67.9%) and single-high coverage (74.8%) than anyone in 2025.\n\nKamari Lassiter, Jalen Pitre, Danielle Hunter, Derek Stingley Jr. and Will Anderson Jr. make it pretty easy to take those risks…\n\nI don’t necessarily know if there’s a way to “take advantage” given that group’s undeniable talent, but if there was it would involve trusting the league’s most accurate deep-ball quarterback to exploit that loyalty to simplicity.\n\nDrake Maye isn’t your typical sophomore signal-caller, but there are aspects to his game that need to be cleaned up.\n\nMaye’s unwillingness to accept defeat on individual plays is an issue, and it came back to bite him in the ass during last weekend’s wild-card victory over the Los Angeles Chargers — leading to two fumbles on five sacks.\n\nHouston defensive coordinator Matt Burke won’t stray from what made his defense the best in football, but perhaps making slight schematic changes can throw a wrench in things and present them with a few opportunities to take advantage of one of the youngster’s few bad habits.\n\nJosh McDaniels has plenty of friends down in Houston, Texas.\n\nTexans general manager Nick Caserio, offensive coordinator Nick Caserio, special teams coordinator Frank Ross, offensive line coach Cole Popovich, offensive assistant Jerry Schuplinski and wide receivers coach Ben McDaniels — you can put two and two together on that one — previously worked with the guy, so they know exactly what he’s capable of and most comfortable with doing.\n\nI’d expect there to be a few wrinkles in the offensive gameplan — perhaps we see the Wing-T or the Wildcat. I just don’t think we’ll see that tired old flea flicker, the double pass, or that quarterback throwback he seems to be obsessed with.\n\nIt’s a simple formula; build an early lead, run the football, watch your defense dominate.\n\nThe Texans have been built to do exactly that, but the only way it works is if you’re able to run the ball effectively. Woody Marks, Nick Chubb, Jawhar Jordan, Dare Ogunbowale and British Brooks have combined for precisely two 100-yards games in 2025, but one of those came in their wild-card victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers…\n\nFrom the goal line to midfield!\n\nBig gain for Rhamondre Stevenson 😤\n\nLACvsNE on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/8VkxijZMq0\n\n“If you want to control the game, you have to win on first downs.”\n\nNo, if you want to control this game, you have to win on second down.\n\nHouston is the best second-down defense in football, as they force an average of eight yards to gain on third downs. New England needs to stay ahead of the chains, but especially on second down as it will allow for more options on third downs.\n\nWill Campbell and Jared Wilson didn’t exactly have the best postseason debuts, giving up four sacks and 10 total pressures, and things are only going to get more difficult against a unit that ranked first in opponent passer rating (75.0), third in opponent completion percentage (58.92%) and eighth in sack percentage (7.59%).\n\nI’d say it’s a bit of a mismatch…\n\nDerek Barnett, Denico Autry, Sheldon Rankins, Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. are pressure machines, but they’ll need to finish in order to actually make a difference in this one. Drake Maye finished with a 102.6 passer rating when under pressure in 2025.\n\nIf you’re going to stop him, you have to get home.\n\nAdam Schefter Delivers Fiery Take On Eagles’ A.J.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRunning backs have a short shelf life in the NFL, and for players who are bell cows, that is even more so, yet Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry continues to buck that trend.\n\nNormally, we see production start to decline once players reach their late 20s, but in Henry's case, he's still the All-Pro we've known for years.\n\nIn 2025, despite the Ravens' struggles, Henry still posted 1,595 yards and 16 touchdowns at the ripe age of 31. That's ridiculous.\n\nAnd for Maurice Jones-Drew, in his top 64 starting running backs piece for NFL.com, Henry came in at No. 6.\n\n“Other than some early-season fumbling issues, Henry had one hell of a season at 31 years old,” Jones-Drew wrote. “The ageless wonder continued to trounce defenses and finished the season with an absolute bang, rushing for 570 yards and six touchdowns on 85 carries over the final four games.\n\n\"That's 6.7 per clip. Normally, the football world starts to wonder when 31-year-old running backs will consider hanging 'em up. Henry feels far from it.”\n\nMore:Ravens make $74.5 million contract stance clear with Lamar Jackson\n\nMost 31-year-old running backs just want to be productive for their teams.\n\nBut in Henry's case, he's dominating.\n\nIn his last seven NFL seasons, Henry has surpassed 1,500 rushing yards five times and has had 16 rushing TDs four times. Let that sink in.\n\nPlus, he's played every regular-season game in the last three years. That speaks to his longevity in the game.\n\nSome thought Henry was declining when he joined Baltimore in 2024 after a 1,167-yard, 12-TD season in 2023, but he's shown that, at least right now, Father Time is going to have to wait.\n\n2 huge roster decisions could define new Ravens HC\n\nSteve Bisciotti didn't want 'jerk move' to happen to Ravens ex John Harbaugh\n\nWhy Ravens owner was right to fire John Harbaugh\n\nRavens owner makes outstanding Lamar Jackson contract stance",

    "fullText": "Bruised and battle-hardened, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills face Denver on Saturday as their star quarterback seeks to reach his first Super Bowl and add the NFL's biggest prize to his list of accolades.\n\nThe league's reigning Most Valuable Player suffered a head blow, a sprained knee and a hand injury in last weekend's hard-fought clash with Jacksonville, but almost single-handedly dragged his team over the line.\n\nNow, Allen has been cleared fit to play against the Broncos -- the AFC's top seed -- in their highly anticipated divisional round game, knowing victory would leave them just one win away from next month's NFL championship decider.\n\n\"I feel good. Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks,\" Allen, who has also been managing a long-term foot injury, told a press conference.\n\nAllen's run of 122 consecutive starts is the longest streak among active quarterbacks and has led to his teammates and fans jokingly referring to him as \"Superman.\"\n\nBut the quarterback, who hails from the agricultural Central Valley of California, told reporters his toughness came from being a \"country boy\" from \"out in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that the defensive line he will be facing is notoriously robust.\n\n\"They've got some absolute studs over there. Obviously they rush the passer extremely well,\" said Allen.\n\n\"Interior, again, some big stout guys that can really push the pocket.\"\n\nFor Denver, the match-up comes after a bye week, and offers another chance to prove that one of this season's surprise packages can be the real deal at the business end of the campaign.\n\nDespite finishing top of the AFC with the league's joint best record (14-3), the Broncos figure only fifth on the betting market's predicted Super Bowl winners.\n\nStar cornerback Pat Surtain said the team would be relying on a raucous crowd to spur them on for the Broncos' first postseason home game since 2015.\n\n\"I know the atmosphere is going to be crazy, the stadium is going to be rocking,\" Surtain said.\n\n\"I can already feel the magnitude of it,\" he added.\n\nIt is also a chance for the Broncos to avenge last year's devastating 31-7 playoff loss in Buffalo.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, the injury-ravaged San Francisco 49ers will attempt the next step in their bid to reach a home-field Super Bowl by taking on the high-flying Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe clash pits the two divisional rivals against each other for the second time in three weeks.\n\nAs top seeds in the NFC, the Seahawks also had a bye last weekend. By contrast the 49ers -- who have been decimated by a deepening injury crisis for much of the season -- suffered yet another cruel blow against Philadelphia, when tight end George Kittle tore his Achilles tendon.\n\n\"We've kind of been in a hole for about seven months and once you get to the playoffs, it really doesn't matter,\" said 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, of the non-stop schedule.\n\n\"Everyone's into it. So, whether they gave us three days, one day, eight days... whenever you get dealt your hand, you're ready to roll.\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl will be held at the 49ers' home stadium, in Santa Clara, California, on February 8.\n\nIn Sunday's remaining divisional round games, the New England Patriots will host the Houston Texans, and the Los Angeles Rams travel to the Chicago Bears.",

    "fullText": "Serena Williams teased fans with an unlikely return to tennis late last year, with her name having appeared on a drug testing pool.\n\nWilliams immediately shut down the excitement of a potential comeback, with her decision to retire seemingly not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe American legend called time on her glittering career in 2022, leaving tennis with 23 Grand Slam titles to her name.\n\nAnd just a few weeks later, her fellow legend Roger Federer made the same decision, retiring with 20 Grand Slam titles.\n\nFederer is now in Melbourne for the Australian Open, where he was asked about Williams potentially making a return.\n\nHe said of his fellow 44-year-old: “I heard she entered the doping program. Then I heard she’s not coming back.”\n\nAnd when asked why she would put her name down if she wasn’t considering a comeback, he said: “Miss those things, you know.\n\n“So much fun to always think about. That’s one of the big things I was happy to retire at the end, not to have that in my mind.\n\n“For the game, it would be incredible. Serena is such a legend to come back. Also the stories as a mom, with Belinda [Bencic]. It resonates with everyone in the room.\n\n“If she decides not to do it, I would maybe give herself an option. It’s great to have options in life, in my opinion. Let’s see what she does and wait for an announcement or not. Then we’ll see.”\n\nIt remains to be seen what decision Williams takes going forward, but most tennis fans would welcome her back onto the court with open arms.\n\nIntriguingly, her sister is back playing at the age of 45, with Venus Williams set to take on the 2026 Australian Open.\n\nThe veteran has received a wildcard for the Grand Slam, and could potentially face Coco Gauff in round two if she wins her opener against Olga Danilovic.\n\nMeanwhile, Federer’s compatriot Bencic will take on Katie Boulter after her impressive displays at the United Cup earned her the MVP award.\n\nHer 5-0 singles record has also helped her become the first mother since Serena Williams in 2021 to break the WTA top 10.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid are hoping to return to winning ways on Saturday when they host Levante, but they will be without the services of star striker Kylian Mbappe for the La Liga clash at the Bernabeu.\n\nIt has been a difficult week for Real Madrid, who lost to Barcelona in the Spanish Supercup final before being dumped out of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday by Segunda side Albacete. In this period, Xabi Alonso also left his position as head coach, which has been filled by Alvaro Arbeloa.\n\nArbeloa will take charge of his first home match as Real Madrid manager, but as was the case for his debut against Albacete, he will be without Mbappe. As per Marca, the French forward will not be risked at the Bernabeu, given that he is still struggling with discomfort from the knee injury he sustained pre-winter break.\n\nMbappe trained during Thursday’s session and did not appear to have any issues, but internally, it has been decided that he will not be involved against Levante. He played through the pain barrier during last weekend’s Superclasico defeat, but there is a desire for no more risks to be taken with his recovery.\n\nMbappe’s absence will almost certainly mean that Gonzalo Garcia will continue as the starting striker. The 21-year-old has been impressive in the Frenchman’s absence, with five goals in his last four appearances – which includes a hattrick against Real Betis, one in El Clasico, and one in the Copa del Rey defeat to Albacete.\n\nGonzalo will fancy his chances to continue his good form against Levante. Real Madrid need to get back to winning ways as soon as possible, although it won’t be easy against an opponent that is unbeaten in their last three matches.",

    "fullText": "Ohio quarterback Parker Navarro has entered the NCAA Transfer Portal, On3’s Pete Nakos has learned. He’s spent the past four seasons with the Bobcats.\n\nNavarro played high school football at Desert Vista (Phoenix, AZ), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 1308 overall recruit in the 2020 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted algorithm that complies all major recruiting media services. He originally committed to UCF.\n\nOver the course of his collegiate career, Navarro has passed for 5,030 yards and 30 touchdowns, while rushing for 30 touchdowns, as well. He’ll be looking to step up to a bigger stage and make an impact in 2026.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCAA Division I Administrative Committee passed dates for the one-time-only college football transfer portal back earlier in October. As it stands, the 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days. It’ll span Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA announced.\n\nMoving forward, the entire Division I football notification of transfer windows is slated for Jan 2-16. As has been the previous standard, athletes on College Football Playoff teams still playing would have 5 days beginning the day after their team’s final game to enter the transfer portal.\n\nAdditionally, players have 15 days to enter the portal, but they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the deadline for committing is how late a school can enroll a player through admissions.\n\nOne caveat is that if a head coach is fired, the transfer portal will not open for players immediately. The NCAA revealed that moving forward, players will only have 15 days to enter the portal after a coaching change, instead of the former allocation of 30 days. Players will also have to wait five days after a new coach is hired or announced.\n\nFinally, graduate transfers also cannot enter the transfer portal until Jan. 2 with the new one-time-only portal window. All these new guidelines are bound to shake things up, but the transfer portal will still remain as interesting and entertaining as ever.",

    "fullText": "Ben Sherman is dressing Team GB for the Olympics—here's your first look originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBen Sherman is heading back to the Olympic stage.\n\nAccording to Flaunt, the British heritage label has been confirmed as the Official Ceremony Wear Supplier for Team GB at the upcoming Milano Cortina 2026, marking the fourth straight Games in which the brand has outfitted the delegation for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies.\n\nMORE: Savannah James melts Lebron's heart with stunning new look\n\nFor this Winter Games cycle, Ben Sherman leaned into cold-weather functionality while keeping its tailoring roots intact. The ceremonial wardrobes are designed to balance warmth, movement, and visual identity—key requirements for athletes stepping into the spotlight during two of the most-watched moments of the Games.\n\nA major element of the collection comes from the brand’s collaboration with five-time Olympic medalist and Paris 2024 flagbearer Tom Daley. Daley helped design the hand-knit scarves and winter hats worn by Team GB athletes carrying the Union Flag. The accessories feature bold GB lettering and textured cable-knit patterns inspired by the snowy landscape surrounding northern Italy.\n\n“Having had the honour of serving as a Flagbearer for Team GB during my last Olympic Games, I understand how powerful that moment is,” Daley said. “It’s more than carrying a flag; it’s carrying the stories, hopes, and identity of everyone who made that journey with you.”\n\nThe Opening Ceremony look centers on a wool dogtooth topcoat with a chequered lining, layered over a mock-neck sweater woven with raised stripes and a repeating Union Flag motif. Tailored sweat joggers with tonal detailing and winter boots with Vibram soles complete the ensemble, offering a clean mix of tradition and performance-ready design.\n\nFor the Closing Ceremony, the silhouettes soften. Athletes will wear a chunky wool-blend knitted track jacket featuring Team GB’s zig-zag illustration, paired with a navy and ecru merino roll-neck for warmth without bulk.\n\nBen Sherman’s campaign spotlighting the collection features British ice dancers Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson, whose movement-driven visuals echo the rhythm and unity of the team itself.\n\nMORE: Karrueche Tran shows off cute bob amid Deion Sanders romance\n\nBehind the scenes, global brand owner Marquee Brands sees the partnership as a natural fit.

    "title": "Tennessee Titans head coach search: Ranking the remaining candidates",
    "description": "The Tennessee Titans head coaching search continues, so we ranked the remaining candidates and grouped them into tiers.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are still searching for their next head coach, and with the news that John Harbaugh was hired by the New York Giants, his meeting with the Titans was cancelled. Harbaugh would have been a solid hire, if the Titans had landed him, but they never got a shot.\n\nHe wasn't the only candidate the Titans had, though. They've already completed seven interviews and have more scheduled in the coming weeks. Let's take a look at the remaining candidates the Titans will consider, ranked in tiers.\n\nJason Garrett, NBC personality: While he has head coaching experience with the Dallas Cowboys, Garrett hasn't coached since he was fired by the New York Giants in 2021. He was 85-67 during his 10 years as head coach, but 2-3 in the playoffs.\n\nSteve Spagnuolo, DC, Chiefs: Spags has spent most of his coaching career as a defensive coordinator, with a short stint as head coach of the (then) St. Louis Rams. He's been with the Kansas City Chiefs since 2019, helping the Chiefs to three Super Bowl victories and multiple playoff appearances.\n\nRaheem Morris, former HC, Falcons: Morris has been coaching in the NFL since 2002, earning his first head coaching gig with the Tampa By Buccaneers in 2009-2011. His second head coaching role would be with the Falcons from 2024-2025. His record as a head coach is 35-56.\n\nJonathan Gannon, former HC, Cardinals: Gannon was fired by the Cardinals after his third season as head coach. In his only head coaching role, the Cardinals failed to make the playoffs or record a winning season. His overall record is 15-36.\n\nBrian Daboll, former HC, Giants: Daboll spent eight years as an offensive coordinator before landing the head coaching role with the Giants. Over his four years in New York, Daboll's Giants were 20-40-1, and 1-1 in the playoffs. The playoff appearance was his first season with the team, but they could not find success again.\n\nLou Anarumo, DC, Colts: While Anarumo does not have head coaching experience, he has quickly risen up the ranks in the NFL coaching world. He joined the Dolphins in 2012 as their defensive backs coach and was a defensive coordinator by 2019. In 2025, he was instrumental in the team's 8-2 start before the Colts lost their last seven games.\n\nKliff Kingsbury, former OC, Commanders: After 10 years as a college coach, Kingsbury was hired by the Arizona Cardinals as head coach. In his four years there, the Cardinals were 28-37 and 0-1 in the playoffs. He returned to the college scene in 2023 before joining the Washington Commanders as offensive coordinator in 2024. The two sides mutually parted following the Commanders' five-win season in 2025.\n\nJeff Hafley, DC, Packers: Another coach who has spent more time at the collegiate level than the professional level, Hafley's defense ranked 10th in the NFL in passing this season. The run defense was mediocre, especially after Micah Parsons was injured. He has not been a head coach at the professional level.\n\nMatt Nagy, OC, Chiefs: Nagy already has ties to Tennessee through Mike Borgonzi, as the two worked together in Kansas City for a number of years. He also has previous head coaching experience with the Chicago Bears, where he was 34-31 but couldn't get past the Wild Card round of the playoffs.\n\nChris Shula, DC, Rams: Shula's name alone carries weight as he comes from a family of storied coaches, including his grandfather, Don Shula. He's worked his way up the ranks in the Los Angeles Rams' organization as a defensive guy, and while he's not held a head coaching position, coming from the Sean McVay coaching tree certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nJesse Minter, DC, Chargers: Minter has not held a head coaching role in his career. He had a brief stint with the Baltimore Ravens in various defensive roles, but most of his experience is collegiate. He joined the Los Angeles Chargers in 2024, following Jim Harbaugh from Michigan, where the two worked together since 2019.\n\nVance Joseph, DC, Broncos: Joseph is a defensive guy who had a two-year stint as head coach of the Denver Broncos. The Broncos were 5-11 and 6-10 in his first two seasons, leading to his firing. However, his current defense was one of the top in the NFL in 2025, which is partly why the Broncos are still in the playoffs.\n\nRobert Saleh, DC, 49ers: Saleh's one stint as a head coach was with the New York Jets, and we won't hold that against him. He was 20-36 as head coach of the Jets, but the Jets haven't been relevant since Rex Ryan left, so there's a bit of a caveat there. His 49ers defense is still in the playoffs in 2025, so he's doing something right.\n\nMike McDaniel, former HC, Dolphins: One of the few offensive-minded coaches in the running, McDaniel was 35-33 and 0-2 in the playoffs as head coach of the Miami Dolphins, but his experience in developing Tua Tagovailoa will be instrumental in the development of Cam Ward. He remains a top contender in Tennessee.\n\nMike McCarthy, former HC, Cowboys: McCarthy is a veteran head coach with 18 years of head coaching experience. He spent 13 years with the Green Bay Packers, where they made nine playoff appearances and won a Super Bowl, and five years with the Dallas Cowboys. His overall record is 174-112-2. He only had five losing seasons and one season at .500, while the rest show a winning record.\n\nKevin Stefanski, former HC, Browns: Stefanski's head coaching record is 45-56 and 1-2 in the playoffs. But he took the Cleveland Browns to the playoffs after a 17-year absence. He was saddled with a ridiculous quarterback situation, among other things, so we'll put him in the same category as Saleh and not hold that against him. The offense struggled for several reasons, but the Browns' defense ranked near the top of the league in several categories in 2025. He is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year.\n\nArthur Smith, OC, Steelers: Smith entered the NFL in 2011 as a defensive quality control coach in 2011. He remained with the team through 2020 and was part of three playoff runs. As head coach of the Falcons in 2021-2023, he was 21-30 with zero playoff appearances. The Steelers have made the playoffs for the last two seasons, but lost in the Wild Card round each time.\n\nThe Titans have a ton of options at head coach. Some are better than others, and most of us would like to see a combination of these names join the organization for a complete reset.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans: Ranking the remaining head coaching candidates",

    "description": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif.",
    "fullText": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — Another season, another gut punch. The Los Angeles Chargers walked off the field after yet another playoff loss, and once again the uncomfortable truth is staring the organization — and its fan base — directly in the face: Justin Herbert is now 0–3 in the postseason.\n\nAt some point, the excuses have to stop.\n\nFor years, Herbert has been sold as the answer. The golden-armed franchise quarterback. The future Hall of Famer. The one who would finally erase six decades of Chargers heartbreak. But three playoff games is no longer “too small a sample size.” It’s a pattern — and it’s an ugly one.\n\n#Chargers GM Joe Horitz discussed whether he set Justin Herbert up to succeed.\n\n“At times we did, at times we didn’t,” Hortiz said. “Until we win a Super Bowl, I’ll tell you we weren’t good enough.”@SportingTrib | #BoltUp pic.twitter.com/zAHwaKg4Mi\n\n— Fredo Cervantes (@FredoCervantes) January 15, 2026\n\nThis latest Wild Card loss was supposed to be different. New leadership. A championship pedigree head coach. A staff that, by all accounts, did enough to put Herbert in position to win. Yet when the lights were brightest, Herbert was nowhere to be found. No urgency. No takeover moment. No signature drive. Just another quiet exit.\n\nAnd no, this one doesn’t fall on Greg Roman.\n\nRoman paid the price with his job, but firing him feels more like organizational therapy than accountability. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh called it a “fresh start” and a “results-oriented” decision. Fair enough. But if we’re truly being results-oriented, then the conversation can’t keep stopping everywhere except the quarterback.\n\nChargers GM Joe Hortiz was refreshingly honest when asked whether the team put Herbert in position to succeed.\n\n“At times we did, at times we didn’t,” Hortiz said. “Until we win a Super Bowl, I’ll tell you we weren’t good enough.”\n\nThat’s the most truthful statement made by anyone in the building — and it applies directly to Herbert.\n\nHarbaugh, predictably, defended his quarterback.\n\nWinners show up when it matters. Winners elevate in January. Winners don’t shrink in three straight playoff appearances. Herbert hasn’t just lost — he has underperformed relative to his own elite regular-season standard. And that’s the part Chargers fans are tired of ignoring.\n\nThis franchise hasn’t won a Super Bowl in over 60 years. Sixty. That’s generations of loyal fans investing emotionally, financially, and spiritually into a team that continually finds new ways to fall short. The Chargers don’t need pretty throws in September. They need wins in January.\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nLos Angeles Chargers quarterback, Justin Herbert (10) passing during an NFL football game against the Las Vegas Raiders on November 30, 2025 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nRight now, Herbert looks like the ultimate regular-season quarterback — capable of piling up yards, highlight throws, and analytics love — but not capable of carrying a team when the pressure peaks. That’s not a Hall of Fame résumé. That’s a cautionary one.\n\nThe organization seems to understand something has to change, which brings us to the offensive coordinator search. Herbert, notably, will have no say in it.\n\n“I have no questions about his ability as a player,” Harbaugh said. “He’s not looking to be the GM or the coach. It’s our responsibility to put him in the best position possible.”\n\nThat’s fine. Quarterbacks don’t need personnel power. But at some point, “putting him in position” has to stop being the shield. The coaching staff did enough. The roster did enough. Herbert didn’t.\n\nSo now the Chargers search for another “fix.” Marcus Brady has already interviewed. More candidates are coming. The net, as Harbaugh said, is wide. They want someone with a track record, vision, and proven success. They want a physical run game. A tough, smart offense. A “head coach of the offense.”\n\nAnd maybe they’ll find the right system. But systems don’t throw the ball. Quarterbacks do.\n\nIf Herbert truly is the quarterback Harbaugh believes he is, then it shouldn’t matter who the coordinator is when the season is on the line. Great quarterbacks overcome. Elite quarterbacks elevate. Championship quarterbacks don’t need everything perfect to deliver one playoff win.\n\nHerbert still hasn’t delivered one.\n\nThe Chargers will keep building. They’ll keep changing coordinators. They’ll keep promising progress. But unless Herbert proves he can be more than a regular-season star, the ending will remain the same.\n\nAnother January loss. Another fresh start. Another year further away from the championship Chargers fans have waited six decades to see.",

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Pete Nakos, Jordan Seaton is currently in Starkville to visit Mississippi State. Seaton is close with the Bulldogs’ offensive line coach, Phil Loadholt, from their time at Colorado. A huge development for head coach Jeff Lebby, hoping to get in the running for one of the best players in the NCAA transfer portal.\n\nLoadholt only spent one season in Boulder. Colorado hired him away from Oklahoma, where he was an offensive analyst on Brent Venables’ initial staff. Lebby was the offensive coordinator at the time, making the connection between the two. So when Lebby needed an OL coach at Mississippi State, Loadholt wound up being his guy.\n\nNow, the coaching duo is hoping the connection can pay dividends. The competition for Seaton is going to be a tough one. Nakos recently provided the latest on where things stand for the offensive tackle. Friday will bring another SEC trip for him, heading to the 40 Acres to see the Texas Longhorns.\n\nThe On3 Industry Transfer Portal Rankings have Seaton as a four-star prospect and No. 4 overall player to enter this cycle. No offensive tackle ranks above him, showing how highly thought of he is. Seaton is also the No. 1 player currently available in the portal.\n\nColorado got Seaton on campus ahead of the 2024 season, being a massive recruiting win for head coach Deion Sanders. He immediately slotted into the left tackle role, initially protecting quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Some positives came from Seaton’s true freshman campaign before really exploding in 2025. Quality performances earned him second-team All-Big 12.\n\nSeaton played high school football at Bradenton (FL) IMG Academy, where he was a Five-Star Plus+ prospect. He was the No. 18 overall recruit in the 2024 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.",

    "title": "My Gripes with Prolog",
    "description": "It's not my favorite language",
    "fullText": "For the next release of Logic for Programmers, I'm finally adding the sections on Answer Set Programming and Logic Constraint Programming that I TODOd back in version 0.9. And this is making me re-experience some of my pain points with Prolog, which I will gripe about now. If you want to know more about why Prolog is cool instead, go here or here or here or here.\n\nISO \"strings\" are just atoms or lists of single-character atoms (or lists of integer character codes). The various implementations of Prolog add custom string operators but they are not cross compatible, so code written with strings in SWI-Prolog will not work in Scryer Prolog.\n\nCode logic is expressed entirely in rules, predicates which return true or false for certain values. For example if you wanted to get the length of a Prolog list, you write this:\n\nNow this is pretty cool in that it allows bidirectionality, or running predicates \"in reverse\". To generate lists of length 3, you can write length(L, 3). But it also means that if you want to get the length a list plus one, you can't do that in one expression, you have to write length(List, Out), X is Out+1.\n\nFor a while I thought no functions was necessary evil for bidirectionality, but then I discovered Picat has functions and works just fine. That by itself is a reason for me to prefer Picat for my LP needs.\n\n(Bidirectionality is a killer feature of Prolog, so it's a shame I so rarely run into situations that use it.)\n\nAside from atoms (abc) and numbers, there are two data types:\n\nThere's no proper key-value maps or even struct types. Again, this is something that individual distributions can fix (without cross compatibility), but these never feel integrated with the rest of the language.\n\ntrue and false aren't values, they're control flow statements. true is a noop and false says that the current search path is a dead end, so backtrack and start again. You can't explicitly store true and false as values, you have to implicitly have them in facts (passed(test) instead of test.passed? == true).\n\nThis hasn't made any tasks impossible, and I can usually find a workaround to whatever I want to do. But I do think it makes things more inconvenient! Sometimes I want to do something dumb like \"get all atoms that don't pass at least three of these rules\", and that'd be a lot easier if I could shove intermediate results into a sack of booleans.\n\n(This is called \"Negation as Failure\". I think this might be necessary to make Prolog a Turing complete general programming language. Picat fixes a lot of Prolog's gripes and still has negation as failure. ASP has regular negation but it's not Turing complete.)\n\nProlog finds solutions through depth first search, and a \"cut\" (!) symbol prevents backtracking past a certain point. This is necessary for optimization but can lead to invalid programs.\n\nYou're not supposed to use cuts if you can avoid it, so I pretended cuts didn't exist. Which is why I was surprised to find that conditionals are implemented with cuts. Because cuts are spooky dark magic conditionals sometimes conditionals work as I expect them to and sometimes leave out valid solutions and I have no idea how to tell which it'll be. Usually I find it safer to just avoid conditionals entirely, which means my code gets a lot longer and messier.\n\nThe original example in the last section was this:\n\nfoo(1, 2) returns true, so you'd expect f(A, B) to return A=1, B=2. But it returns false. Whereas this works as expected.\n\nI thought this was because \\+ was implemented with cuts, and the Clocksin book suggests it's call(P), !, fail, so this was my prime example about how cuts are confusing. But then I tried this:\n\nThere's no way to get that behavior with cuts! I don't think \\+ uses cuts at all! And now I have to figure out why \nfoo(A, B) doesn't returns results. Is it floundering? Is it because \\+ P only succeeds if P fails, and A = B always succeeds? A closed-world assumption? Something else?1\n\nSay I have a program like this:\n\nAnd I want to know all of the nodes that are parents of branches. The normal way to do this is with a query:\n\nThis is interactively making me query for every result. That's usually not what I want, I know the result of my query is finite and I want all of the results at once, so I can count or farble or whatever them. It took a while to figure out that the proper solution is bagof(Template, Goal, Bag), which will \"Unify Bag with the alternatives of Template\":\n\nWait crap that's still giving one result at a time, because N is a free variable in bagof so it backtracks over that. It surprises me but I guess it's good to have as an option. So how do I get all of the results at once?\n\nThe only difference is the N^Goal, which tells bagof to ignore and group the results of N. As far as I can tell, this is the only place the ISO standard uses ^ to mean anything besides exponentiation. Supposedly it's the existential quantifier? In general whenever I try to stray outside simpler use-cases, especially if I try to do things non-interactively, I run into trouble.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize the reason bagof \"works\" is because infix symbols are mapped to prefix compound terms, so that a^b is ^(a, b), and then different predicates can decide to do different things with ^(a, b).\n\nThis is also why you can't just write A = B+1: that unifies A with the compound term +(B, 1). A+1 = B+2 is false, as 1 \\= 2. You have to write A+1 is B+2, as is is the operator that converts +(B, 1) to a mathematical term.\n\n(And that fails because is isn't fully bidirectional. The lhs must be a single variable. You have to import clpfd and write A + 1 #= B + 2.)\n\nI don't like this, but I'm a hypocrite for saying that because I appreciate the idea and don't mind custom symbols in other languages. I guess what annoys me is there's no official definition of what ^(a, b) is, it's purely a convention. ISO Prolog uses -(a, b) (aka a-b) as a convention to mean \"pairs\", and the only way to realize that is to see that an awful lot of standard modules use that convention. But you can use -(a, b) to mean something else in your own code and nothing will warn you of the inconsistency.\n\nAnyway I griped about pairs so I can gripe about sort.\n\nAccording to an expert online this is because sort is supposed to return a sorted set, not a sorted list. If you want to preserve duplicates you're supposed to lift all of the values into -($key, $value) compound terms, then use keysort, then extract the values. And, since there's no functions, this process takes at least three lines. This is also how you're supposed to sort by a custom predicate, like \"the second value of a compound term\".\n\n(Most (but not all) distributions have a duplicate merge like msort. SWI-Prolog also has a sort by key but it removes duplicates.)\n\nI don't care if it makes fact parsing ambiguous, I just don't want \"reorder two lines\" to be a syntax error anymore\n\nI expect by this time tomorrow I'll have been Cunningham'd and there will be a 2000 word essay about how all of my gripes are either easily fixable by doing XYZ or how they are the best possible choice that Prolog could have made. I mean, even in writing this I found out some fixes to problems I had. Like I was going to gripe about how I can't run SWI-Prolog queries from the command line but, in doing do diligence finally finally figured it out:\n\nIt's pretty clunky but still better than the old process of having to enter an interactive session every time I wanted to validate a script change.\n\n(Also, answer set programming is pretty darn cool. Excited to write about it in the book!)\n\nA couple of people mentioned using dif/2 instead of \\+ A = B. Dif is great but usually I hit the negation footgun with things like \\+ foo(A, B), bar(B, C), baz(A, C), where dif/2 isn't applicable. ↩",

    "description": "Explore the inevitable shift from scripts to AI agents in coding. Discover insights on automation, tool access, and setting effective guardrails.",
    "fullText": "I’ve noticed a pattern in my coding life. It starts innocently enough. I sit down to write a simple Python script, maybe something to tidy up my Obsidian vault or a quick CLI tool to query an API. “Keep it simple,” I tell myself. “Just input, processing, output.”\n\nBut then, the inevitable thought creeps in: It would be cool if the model could decide which file to read based on the user’s question.\n\nTwo hours later, I’m not writing a script anymore. I’m writing a while loop. I’m defining a tools array. I’m parsing JSON outputs and handing them back to the model. I’m building memory context windows.\n\n(For those keeping track: my working definition of an “agent” is simple: a model running in a loop with access to tools. I explored this in depth in my Agentic Shift series, but that’s the core of it.)\n\nAs I sit here writing this in January of 2026, I realize that almost every AI project I worked on last year ultimately became an agent. It feels like a law of nature: Every AI project, given enough time, converges on becoming an agent. In this post, I want to share some of what I’ve learned, and the cases where you might skip the intermediate steps and jump straight to building an agent.\n\nThis isn’t just feature creep. It’s a fundamental shift in how we interact with software. We are moving past the era of “smart typewriters” and into the era of “digital interns.”\n\nTake Gemini Scribe, my plugin for Obsidian. When I started, it was a glorified chat window. You typed a prompt, it gave you text. Simple. But as I used it, the friction became obvious. If I wanted Scribe to use another note as context for a task, I had to take a specific action, usually creating a link to that note from the one I was working on, to make sure it was considered. I was managing the model’s context manually.\n\nI was the “glue” code. I was the context manager.\n\nThe moment I gave Scribe access to the read_file tool, the dynamic changed. Suddenly, I wasn’t micromanaging context; I was giving instructions. “Read the last three meeting notes and draft a summary.” That’s not a chat interaction; that’s a delegation. And to support delegation, the software had to become an agent, capable of planning, executing, and iterating.\n\nThe Gemini CLI followed a similar arc. There were many of us on the team experimenting with Gemini on the command line. I was working on iterative refinement, where the model would ask clarifying questions to create deeper artifacts. Others were building the first agentic loops, giving the model the ability to run shell commands.\n\nOnce we saw how much the model could do with even basic tools, we were hooked. Suddenly, it wasn’t just talking about code; it was writing and executing it. It could run tests, see the failure, edit the file, and run the tests again. It was eye-opening how much we could get done as a small team.\n\nBut with great power comes great anxiety. As I explored in my Agentic Shift post on building guardrails and later in my post about the Policy Engine, I found myself staring at a blinking cursor, terrified that my helpful assistant might accidentally rm -rf my project.\n\nThis is the hallmark of the agentic shift: you stop worrying about syntax errors and start worrying about judgment errors. We had to build a “sudoers” file for our AI, a permission system that distinguishes between “read-only exploration” and “destructive action.” You don’t build policy engines for scripts; you build them for agents.\n\nLast year, I learned to recognize a specific code smell: the AI classifier.\n\nIn my Podcast RAG project, I wanted users to search across both podcast descriptions and episode transcripts. Different databases, different queries. So I did what felt natural: I built a small classifier using Gemini Flash Lite. It would analyze the user’s question and decide: “Is this a description search or a transcript search?” Then it would call the appropriate function.\n\nIt worked. But something nagged at me. I had written a classifier to make a decision that a model is already good at making. Worse, the classifier was brittle. What if the user wanted both? What if their intent was ambiguous? I was encoding my assumptions about user behavior into branching logic, and those assumptions were going to be wrong eventually.\n\nThe fix was almost embarrassingly simple. I deleted the classifier and gave the agent two tools: search_descriptions and search_episodes. Now, when a user asks a question, the agent decides which tool (or tools) to use. It can search descriptions first, realize it needs more detail, and then dive into transcripts. It can do both in parallel. It makes the call in context, not based on my pre-programmed heuristics. (You can try it yourself at podcasts.hutchison.org.)\n\nI saw the same pattern in Gemini Scribe. Early versions had elaborate logic for context harvesting, code that tried to predict which notes the user would need based on their current document and conversation history. I was building a decision tree for context, and it was getting unwieldy.\n\nWhen I moved Scribe to a proper agentic architecture, most of that logic evaporated. The agent didn’t need me to pre-fetch context; it could use a read_file tool to grab what it needed, when it needed it. The complex anticipation logic was replaced by simple, reactive tool calls. The application got simpler and more capable at the same time.\n\nHere’s the heuristic I’ve landed on: If you’re writing if/else logic to decide what the AI should do, you might be building a classifier that wants to be an agent. Deconstruct those branches into tools, give the agent really good descriptions of what those tools can do, and then let the model choose its own adventure.\n\nYou might be thinking: “What about routing queries to different models? Surely a classifier makes sense there.” I’m not so sure anymore. Even model routing starts to look like an orchestration problem, and a lightweight orchestrator with tools for accessing different models gives you the same flexibility without the brittleness. The question isn’t whether an agent can make the decision better than your code. It’s whether the agent, with access to the actual data in the moment, can make a decision at least as good as what you’re trying to predict when you’re writing the code. The agent has context you don’t have at development time.\n\nWe are transitioning from Human-in-the-Loop (where we manually approve every step) to Human-on-the-Loop (where we set the goals and guardrails, but let the system drive).\n\nThis shift is driven by a simple desire: we want partners, not just tools. As I wrote back in April about waiting for a true AI coding partner, a tool requires your constant attention. A hammer does nothing unless you swing it. But an agent? An agent can work while you sleep.\n\nThis freedom comes with a new responsibility: clarity. If your agent is going to work overnight, you need to make sure it’s working on something productive. You need to be precise about the goal, explicit about the boundaries, and thoughtful about what happens when things go wrong. Without the right guardrails, an agent can get stuck waiting for your input, and you’ll lose that time. Or worse, it can get sidetracked and spend hours on something that wasn’t what you intended.\n\nThe goal isn’t to remove the human entirely. It’s to move us from the execution layer to the supervision layer. We set the destination and the boundaries; the agent figures out the route. But we have to set those boundaries well.\n\nHere’s the counterintuitive thing: building an agent isn’t always harder than building a script. Yes, you have to think about loops, tool definitions, and context window management. But as my classifier example showed, an agentic architecture can actually delete complexity. All that brittle branching logic, all those edge cases I was trying to anticipate: gone. Replaced by a model that can reason about what it needs in the moment.\n\nThe real complexity isn’t in the code; it’s in the trust. You have to get comfortable with a system that makes decisions you didn’t explicitly program. That’s a different kind of engineering challenge, less about syntax, more about guardrails and judgment.\n\nBut the payoff is a system that grows with you. A script does exactly what you wrote it to do, forever. An agent does what you ask it to do, and sometimes finds better ways to do it than you’d considered.\n\nSo, if you find yourself staring at your “simple script” and wondering if you should give it a tools definition… just give in. You’re building an agent. It’s inevitable. You might as well enjoy the company.",

    "fullText": "As a viral app sparks debate about solo living in China, new Census Bureau data shows that the share of one-person households in the US is reaching record highs.\n\nA new app has risen to the top of China’s iPhone App Store charts — one markedly more macabre than the messaging platforms and AI assistants that typically lead the ranking.\n\nOn Monday, media outlets reported that the viral app Sile Me (which roughly translates from Mandarin as a very literal “Are You Dead?”) had become the country’s most popular paid Apple App Store download.\n\nLaunched in mid-2025 and costing a mere 8 yuan ($1.15) to buy, Sile Me offers just one function: a large button that users can press to confirm that they are, in fact, alive. If they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app will reach out to an appointed emergency contact.\n\nWhile the app’s simplicity is reminiscent of some earlier patrons of the App Store, its sudden popularity is putting the spotlight on the growing cohort of solo dwellers in the Eastern nation.\n\nResearch suggests that there could be as many as 200 million one-person households in China by 2030 — and while a rapidly aging population explains some of that rise, younger people now also appear to be embracing living alone.\n\nIn America, it’s no different. Data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey for 2025 reveals that the number of one-person households in the US is edging close to a record 40 million, with the share of American households made up of just one person hitting an all-time high of 29%.\n\nThis includes an estimated ~1.3 million extra one-person households in 2025 compared with the prior year, though the Bureau noted that this may be reflective of both demographic changes and methodological updates. Even so, the significant rise over the last decade indicates a broader societal shift that’s been playing out around the globe.\n\nAs noted by The Economist in November, the share of people living alone has increased in 26 out of 30 rich countries since 2010.\n\nMarriage rates are continuing to plummet in the US, as well as in China and many other developed nations, which has coincided with rising incomes and some heated online discourse about traditional relationships. And, like China, the surge in solo dwellings is also being driven at the older end of the demographic spectrum: America’s population aged 65 and older, statistically the most likely cohort to live alone, is expected to keep booming.",

    "description": "When analyzing early universe data, the Standard Model of Cosmology suggests that the universe should be more “clumpy” that what we observe.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nWhen analyzing early universe data, the Standard Model of Cosmology suggests that the universe should be more “clumpy” that what we observe.\n\nA new study suggests that interactions between the two most elusive particle types in the universe—dark matter and neutrinos—could help explain this discrepancy.\n\nThe study analyzes cosmic shear data from both the early and late universe, and theorizes that such interactions have a strength of about 10-4.\n\nTwo of the most enigmatic particles in the known universe are dark matter (theorized to make up most of the matter in the cosmos) and neutrinos (weakling-interacting, nearly massless subatomic particles that can’t be observed directly). Because these two particles are decidedly anti-social, it makes sense that the ΛCDM model—our current best guess of what makes the universe tick—suggests that they certainly don’t interact with each other. Right?\n\nWell, not so fast. A new study (from scientists at the University of Sheffield, the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Poland, and the University of Science and Technology of China) analyzes cosmic shear data from the early- and late-universe sources, and suggests that interactions between these two particles could explain why the cosmos isn’t as clumpy as we’d expect from early-universe data alone. The results were published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\n“Observations of the modern universe indicate that matter is slightly less clumped than expected, pointing to a mild mismatch between early- and late-time measurements,” Eleonora Di Valentino, a co-author of the study from the University of Sheffield, said in a press statement. “Our study shows that interactions between dark matter and neutrinos could help explain this difference, offering new insight into how structure formed in the universe.”\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, scientists first needed loads of data from both eras of the universe—and luckily, they had a lot to choose from. For the early universe, they relied on observations from the terrestrial Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the space-based Planck Telescope. For observations of more recent times, the team relied on the massive trove of data from the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\n\nWith data in hand, Valentino and her team focused on a phenomenon called cosmic shear, which describes the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing caused by the universe’s structure. According to Universe Today, if neutrinos and dark matter influence each other, this interaction would impact the structure of galactic clusters and voids in a similar manner to what we observe today. By the team’s observations, dark matter and neutrinos react with a strength of about 10-4.\n\nWhile a compelling piece of evidence, the scientists note that the statistical significance of this finding rests at three sigma (3σ), which is not enough to be considered definitive proof (that typically requires a statistical significance of 5σ). Valentino also clarifies that this discovery doesn’t necessarily upend the ΛCDM model, but may indicate that it is complete.\n\nHopefully, future cosmic microwave background experiments, more precise weak lensing surveys, and ever more accurate data from new telescopes could further confirm (or deny) this big “woah, if true” moment.\n\n“It would not only shed new light on a persistent mismatch between different cosmological probes, but also provide particle physicists with a concrete direction,” William Giarè, a co-author of the study from the University of Sheffield, said in a press statement, “indicating which properties to look for in laboratory experiments to help finally unmask the true nature of dark matter.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Tyrannosaurus rex lived longer and took more time to reach its maximum size than previously thought, according to a new study.\n\nScientists have long counted annual growth rings in fossilized Tyrannosaurus rex leg bones to calculate both their age at death and how fast they grew to adult size. These dinosaurs typically stopped growing around 25 years old and lived to around 30, research has shown.\n\nHowever, a new study published in the journal PeerJ on Wednesday details how a team of scientists used polarized light to reveal previously unseen growth rings from 17 individual specimens. T. rex wouldn’t have reached its maximum size of around 8 tons until it was 35 to 40 years old, the analysis found.\n\nUnlike tree growth rings, dinosaur growth rings only capture the final 10 to 20 years of an individual’s life.\n\nBut because the specimens ranged in age from early juveniles to adults, researchers were able to put together a picture of their growth using a new statistical approach that combines records from individuals of different ages.\n\nDrawing on the largest dataset ever put together for Tyrannosaurus rex, researchers were able to reconstruct their growth history year by year and found that the dinosaurs grew much more slowly than previously thought.\n\n“Instead of growing quickly, T. rex spent most of its life in the mid-body size range rather than achieving a total body length of 40 feet quickly,” lead study author Holly Woodward, a professor of anatomy at Oklahoma State University, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“Additionally, we found that growth ring spacing varied within individuals, with some years showing substantial growth and others very little,” she said. “This variability suggests that growth was flexible and likely influenced by resource availability and possibly environmental conditions.”\n\nThe findings help scientists understand more about the king of the dinosaurs and its role in the world tens of millions of years ago, Woodward said.\n\n“I think the study helps reveal why T. rex was so successful as an apex carnivore — that by growing slowly over a longer period of time, T. rex occupied many food niches throughout its life, eventually becoming large enough that it was only really competing with other T. rex for resources,” she said.\n\nIn addition, differences in the growth curves of some of the specimens involved in the study add to the scientific debate as to whether what paleontologists believed to be a single species named Tyrannosaurus rex is in fact a complex that includes other species or subspecies.\n\nFor example, a study published in October uncovered evidence that a specimen thought to have belonged to a teenage T. rex was actually from a different species known as Nanotyrannus.\n\nWhile the growth rates examined in this study cannot definitively prove the existence of separate species, “the evidence suggests that intriguing possibility, among other possible explanations,” according to the researchers’ statement.\n\nThe new study’s findings mesh well with the recent work on Nanotyrannus, said Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at Scotland’s University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“This is good, provocative work that also suggests that there was more variation among T. rex than we used to think, and that some fossils that have long been called T. rex may actually belong to different species,” Brusatte said.\n\nThe discovery of a new type of dinosaur growth ring could also have wider implications for paleontologists investigating dinosaur growth rates.\n\n“Interpreting multiple closely spaced growth marks is tricky,” said study coauthor Nathan Myhrvold, a mathematician and paleobiologist at invention and investment business Intellectual Ventures, in the statement.\n\n“We found strong evidence that the protocols typically used in growth studies may need to be revised,” he said.\n\n Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.",

    "description": "Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979",
    "fullText": "PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979 Islamic Revolution still afflicts the leading opposition factions.\n\nThat split, between monarchists supporting Reza Pahlavi, son of the ousted shah, and a more organised leftist group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq, has played out online ​and even in angry arguments in street protests in Europe and North America.\n\nHow far either faction has support inside Iran, or might be able to shape events there in the future, is hard to gauge, ‌though analysts and diplomats have for decades regarded both as being far more popular among emigres than inside the country.\n\nMany other Iranians outside Iran are also deeply sceptical of both the monarchists and MEK, but have no organised opposition network comparable to those factions.\n\nThe lack of a universally ‌accepted opposition movement or figurehead has complicated international approaches towards the deadly unrest sweeping Iran, with U.S. President Donald Trump questioning Pahlavi's support even as he weighed air strikes.\n\n\"What's problematic is there has been no inclusive organisation that has been built that can bring together Iranians of all walks of life: religious, ethnic, socioeconomic,\" said Sanam Vakil, Middle East head at the Chatham House think tank in London.\n\nDuring the past two weeks of violent unrest, videos in Iranian cities have shown some demonstrators chanting in support of the ousted monarchy and the late shah's son, who has encouraged the protests.\n\nShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled into exile in 1979 and died a year later, was a close Western ally who harked back to ⁠ancient Persian heritage in framing his rule as a national leader and moderniser. But ‌he resisted democratic change as increasing economic disparities destabilised the country.\n\nHis 65-year-old son, who is based in the U.S., says he wants democracy for Iran and has not specified any role he would seek if the current system collapsed. His supporters run one of the main Persian-language satellite television stations broadcasting into Iran.\n\nReza Pahlavi's supporters in the West have pointed to ‍the videos of protesters in Iran chanting his name as evidence his popularity is growing, saying he is the only figure able to unite the country if the Islamic Republic implodes.\n\nAmong foreign officials and diplomats following Iran there are mixed views as to whether the latest protests show that Pahlavi's role is growing.\n\nA Western diplomat said Pahlavi's name may have been used by street protesters because there were few other recognisable opposition figures, but that there was no sign he commanded the sort of domestic support that could make ​him a future leader.\n\nA European official said a big spike in protest numbers after a call for street action by foreign opponents of the government, including Pahlavi, showed his stature may be broader than was previously understood.\n\nHowever, ‌any role he played would need to be in the context of a wider democratic movement, said Iranian analyst and former diplomat Mehrdad Khonsari. \"You need a coalition of people who believe in democratic values in order to sort of lighten the weight and give greater confidence to people,\" he said.\n\nThe idea that Pahlavi may have popularity inside Iran is not shared by the MEK, whose supporters regard the pre-revolution monarchy as comparable to the current Shi'ite theocracy.\n\nIts supporters online often use the slogan \"No Monarchy, No Supreme Leader\".\n\nThe MEK is a movement fusing leftist and Islamist ideas whose cadres carried out bombings inside Iran before and after the revolution, even as mass support was growing for rival factions on the streets.\n\nThe ruling clerics banished the MEK in 1981 and it established military bases in Iraq that it used to launch attacks on Iranian troops during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, something many Iranians remember with fury.\n\nIt was listed as a terrorist ⁠organisation in the United States until 2012, but some Western politicians have voiced backing for the group including former U.S. secretary of ​state Mike Pompeo.\n\nHowever, the European official described the MEK as widely despised inside Iran, partly because of its conduct during the Iran-Iraq war, ​and analysts say it has had little presence in the country for decades.\n\nThe group's official leader Massoud Rajavi has not been seen since 2002 and is widely thought to be dead, though the MEK has not acknowledged that. His wife, Maryam Rajavi, runs the organisation and its affiliate, the National Council for Resistance in Iran.\n\nGroup officials say their supporters are widespread in Iran and ‍active, though there has been no public sign of support ⁠for the MEK seen by Reuters during the protests.\n\nMonarchists - along with many other Iranian dissidents and Iran's current rulers - regard the MEK with intense suspicion, pointing to its history of violence and enforcement of ideological purity within its ranks.\n\nFor many Iranians, the arguments between the Islamic Republic's theocratic establishment, monarchists voicing nostalgia for the 1970s, and a revolutionary group that lost out in the early 1980s may seem outdated.\n\nEven as monarchist and ⁠MEK supporters remained prominent among émigrés and as the same faces revolved through the upper echelons of the Islamic Republic, Iran's population was doubling in size and growing more urban and educated.\n\nMost major political movements inside Iran after 1979 sought to either bolster or reform the Islamic ‌Republic, rather than sweep it away entirely, until successive waves of protest in recent years demanding more comprehensive change.\n\n\"Iranians inside Iran are, I think, not just looking to the diaspora for their future,\" ‌said Vakil.",

    "description": "Gen X is heading toward retirement with hidden challenges. Discover three sneaky problems that could derail your plans and how to avoid them.",
    "fullText": "Gen X is inching closer to retirement, but many of the challenges waiting ahead are the same ones baby boomers are struggling with right now.\n\nSome of these issues can disrupt even the most carefully built retirement plan. If you’re part of Gen X, make sure you’re aware of these retirement problems so that you have time to adjust and avoid the financial surprises many Boomers are seeing.\n\nMany Boomers assumed they would downsize, cash out some equity and move into a smaller place during retirement. In reality, a lot of them are stuck in houses that are either too expensive to maintain or too large for their current lifestyle.\n\nThe main reason for this is that home prices have gone up so much that selling your home and buying something smaller may not even be worth the effort. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the median sales price of houses sold for the United States is now around $410,000, $100,000 higher than five years ago. Even condos and townhomes in many cities now cost more than what Boomers paid for their original homes. High mortgage rates are also discouraging people from moving because they do not want to trade a low rate for a higher one in retirement.\n\nGen X could face the same situation. You may have a good amount of home equity on paper, but that doesn’t guarantee you can convert it into a more affordable living arrangement. If your future home budget is based on selling and moving, you may want to create a backup plan that accounts for staying put longer than expected.\n\nBe Aware: 64% of Americans Aren’t Prepared For Retirement — and 48% Don’t Care\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nBoomers have already learned that Social Security is not the reliable base income many assume it is. Even though the program is still paying benefits, current retirees are facing two issues that Gen X should prepare for.\n\nThe first is that Social Security can be smaller than expected. The Social Security Board of Trustees projects program cost to rise by 2035 so that taxes will be enough to pay for only 75% of scheduled benefits. In other words, you should plan for benefits that may replace a lower percentage of pre-retirement income.\n\nThe second issue is taxes. Many retirees are surprised to learn that up to 85% of their Social Security benefits can be taxable depending on their total income, per the Social Security Administration (SSA). These tax thresholds have not been adjusted for inflation in decades, so more people are pushed into higher tax liability without realizing it.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "With over 170 million Americans facing below average temperatures, even colder air may be on the horizon thanks to the displacement of the polar vortex that will lock in a deep winter feel and park the coldest air over North America.\n\nIn the coming weeks, cold air will continue for parts of the U.S. thanks to the influence of the polar vortex.\n\nTypically, a strong polar vortex keeps the coldest air locked up around the North and South poles. When it weakens, it allows for cold air intrusions into the lower latitudes, opening a window for cold air to flow into the U.s., but what we’re facing now is different.\n\nIn this case, the polar vortex has been stretched or elongated rather than significantly weakened. When this happens, the coldest air is not able to consolidate in one region and is instead dispersed across a large area, leading to prolonged cold spells.\n\nIn the current circumstances, the displaced polar vortex will keep the coldest air over North America and bring prolonged periods of cold to the eastern portion of the Lower 48 through the end of January.\n\nLooking ahead, forecast guidance suggests the two lobes of the polar vortex may begin to recombine, strengthening the overall vortex again, acting like a focused reservoir of Arctic air.\n\nIn the event the entire core of the polar vortex shifts away from the pole and toward Canada, it would create a \"direct channel\" for frigid temperatures to flow into the U.S.\n\nThe first of this vortex-influenced cold will initially build across Canada late next week before driving south into the U.S. as we head into the final week of January.\n\nIt remains to be seen just how cold it will get, but the greatest probability of frigid air will be from the northern Rockies, through the northern Plains, Great Lakes and into the Northeast.\n\nSo bundle up, the heart of winter lies ahead, and it looks like this year, it may be especially frigid.\n\nThe stretched displacement of the polar vortex that could produce prolonged cold spells for millions of Americans across the Northern Tier comes as a deep winter chill settles in the East.\n\nAfter a quick January thaw for most across the Lower 48, winter will roar back with temperatures crashing well below average from the Upper Midwest and stretching into Florida this week.\n\nFriday morning may be the coldest of the week, with freezing temperatures reaching as far south as Jacksonville and Daytona Beach. To provide perspective on the intensity of the cold, Tallahassee is forecast to be 26 degrees; meanwhile, Denver—located 1,630 miles away and at an elevation 5,155 feet higher—is forecast to be 27 degrees that same morning.\n\nSnow Could Show In The South As Chances Increase Ahead Of The Weekend\n\nThis first shot of arctic air will plunge over 170 million Americans into below-average temperatures Thuesday. While parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast will feel the chill, the most significant shift will occur across the Southeast; cities like Nashville, Atlanta and Louisville may not even reach 40 degrees for an afternoon high.\n\nOn Saturday, a second shot of bitter cold air will hit the Upper Midwest, where high temperatures may struggle to reach 10 degrees.\n\nThis deep freeze will persist through the weekend and into early next week. To make matters worse, wind chills are expected to plunge to -10 to -20 degrees in Minneapolis and Chicago on Sunday.\n\nNfl Rams Vs. Bears Divisional Round Playoff Could Break Record For One Of Coldest Games\n\nWith the NFL Divisional Playoff game in Chicago on Sunday night, fans could witness one of the coldest Bears playoff games on record.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "Jan 15 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications said on Thursday it is offering a $20 credit to hundreds of thousands of customers impacted by ​its 10-hour outage on Wednesday that the U.S. wireless company said ‌was caused by a software issue.\n\nVerizon said the issue primarily impacted customers in the northeast, southern California, ‌Texas and pockets of the Midwest and was not the result of a cyberattack. The issue was resolved around 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT) Wednesday.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said it would review the outage.\n\n\"We did not meet the standard of excellence our ⁠customers expect and that we ‌expect of ourselves. To help provide some relief to those affected, we are giving customers a $20 account credit,\" Verizon said.\n\nThe company ‍added \"if customers are still experiencing issues, we encourage them to restart their devices to reconnect to the network.\"\n\nThe outage prompted several major cities to advise residents to use other carriers ​to call emergency services. Downdetector, which aggregates data on service outages, said ‌late Wednesday it had received 2.2 million reports over the last 24 hours related to the Verizon service disruption.\n\nFederal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr told Reuters after a congressional hearing that the agency would review the issue \"and take appropriate action\".\n\nNew York City told residents the outage could affect some users trying to call 911 ⁠for emergency help. \"Call using a device from ​another carrier, a landline, or go to a ​police/fire station to report emergencies,\" the city said on X.\n\nThe District of Columbia issued a similar alert. The warnings were dropped after ‍operations resumed normally.\n\nVerizon faced a ⁠nationwide wireless outage in late 2024 that affected more than 100,000 users at its peak. The outage drew the FCC's attention after several services ⁠were affected and iPhone users were stuck in \"SOS\" mode. Many users on Wednesday reported the same ‌issue about phones in \"SOS\" mode.",

    "fullText": "CAIRO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A senior figure in the armed wing of Hamas, a Hamas policeman, and a senior figure in the militant group Islamic ​Jihad were among at least ten people killed on Thursday in a ‌series of Israeli strikes across Gaza, according to local sources.\n\nLocal medics and residents reported the deaths of senior ‌Islamic Jihad operative Ashraf Al-Khatib in Nuseirat and a Hamas policeman in Gaza city. A Hamas source said that local commander Mohammed Al-Holy was killed in Deir al-Balah, earlier in the day.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ⁠incident.\n\nHamas condemned the strikes on ‌the Al-Holy family, in a statement that did not mention Mohammed or his role in the group. It accused Israel of violating the ‍ceasefire deal in place since October, and attempting to reignite the conflict.\n\nHealth officials said the deaths included a 16-year-old.\n\nThe Israeli strikes come the day after the United States announced the start of ​the ceasefire agreement's second phase on Wednesday.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have traded blame for violations ‌of the ceasefire and remain far apart from each other on key issues.\n\nMore than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect in October.\n\nIsrael has razed buildings and ordered residents out of more than half of Gaza where its troops remain. Nearly all of the territory's more than 2 million ⁠people now live in makeshift homes or damaged ​buildings in a sliver of territory where Israeli troops ​have withdrawn and Hamas has reasserted control.\n\nThe United Nations children's agency said on Tuesday that over 100 children have been killed in Gaza since ‍the ceasefire, including ⁠victims of drone and quadcopter attacks.\n\nIsrael launched its operations in Gaza in the wake of an attack by Hamas-led fighters in October 2023 which killed 1,200 people, ⁠according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 people, according to health authorities in the strip, ‌and left much of Gaza in ruins.",

The group came together in an effort to address Trump’s pursuit of Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“I would not normally like to say these words, but I will say them: We are very strong,” Motzfeldt said. “We are doing our utmost. But the last days, naturally… Oh, I am getting very emotional. I am overwhelmed.”\n\nShe added: “The last days have been tough. Our preparations and the increasing pressure that has been intense. But I want to say, we are strong in the government. The work is to ensure the the Greenlandic people in our country can feel safe and live securely. We are using all our strength to achieve this as we continue the work.”\n\nOver the past year, Trump hasn’t let up on his desire to take over Greenland. During an interview with press, per Politico, Rasmussen said he and his team hit a roadblock with Trump over the region.\n\n“We didn’t manage to change the American position,” Rasmussen said Wednesday. “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland.

One glimpse was all it took.\n\nSeveral weeks later, we were dating. When my internship ended and I returned to Kentucky, I was eager to get back to Frank as soon as I could — so, we started discussing marriage.\n\nMy parents weren't thrilled to hear I was getting married and moving 4,000 miles away. My mom warned me the distance would be incredibly hard, but I was convinced any homesickness would be manageable and everything would work out … like in a fairy tale.\n\nOnce I was permanently settled in Ireland, the dreamy veneer of this lifestyle began to fade away. Things that hadn't bothered me before suddenly felt like big problems.\n\nFor one thing, finding a nice and affordable rental was more challenging than I expected.\n\nI envisioned our first home together having a patio garden for slow mornings sipping coffee, a guest bedroom for when family came to visit, and a cozy kitchen for gathering with friends.\n\nAfter spending weeks viewing the limited options within our budget — all musty, cramped, soulless one-bedrooms — we finally got lucky and found a small but comfortable place we could afford.\n\nStill, though, I had to give up on my dreams of a garden and spare bedroom, and invest in a good dehumidifier to handle the unrelenting dampness caused by Ireland's frequent rain.\n\nAs my mom predicted, though, the greatest challenge thus far has been dealing with homesickness.\n\nThis was especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, just over five years into my marriage. I'll never forget the video chat with my parents in March 2020, when we discussed whether I should go home or remain in Ireland.\n\nAs a US citizen, I could board one of the few North American flights, but Frank couldn't. It was a moment I never thought I'd face — choosing between my husband and my home.\n\nIn deciding the safest option was to stay put, I didn't know how many months or even years would pass before I'd see my family in Kentucky again.\n\nWhen I see people back home's faces light up after I tell them I live in Ireland, I always want to say it's not as magical as they might imagine … but then, I think of my husband and the life we share.\n\nTogether we've been able to run a business from home, develop our creative interests (acting for him, writing for me), live in a walkable city without a car, enjoy access to amazing local food, and take a cheap flight to Europe whenever wanderlust strikes.\n\nIt's true that Ireland isn't as dreamy in reality as it is on screen, and my homesickness means half of my heart is always somewhere else.\n\nI followed my heart to Ireland, though, and I've chosen to stay because of the love I found here. Perhaps my life is its own type of fairy tale after all.",

The categories were measured using 50 metrics, including the number of attractions, public school quality, housing affordability, unemployment rate, crime and safety, and more.\n\nWalletHub found that the best states to raise a family are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, regions that are home to many of the country's top educational institutions, have healthy job markets, and offer a high quality of life.\n\nSurprisingly, not a single Southern state made the list, despite the region attracting thousands of movers with its strong job growth and relatively affordable housing.

    "description": "My festive spin on the Aperol spritz is a crowd-pleaser with or without alcohol. Here's the four-ingredient recipe that a dietitian reviewed for me.",
    "fullText": "For many, the Aperol spritz is reserved for daylight-saving time, falling into the same bucket as loose linen shirts and beach days.\n\nOnce the clock falls back, the quintessential, three-ingredient summer cocktail — made with Aperol, Prosecco, and sparkling water — seems to go into hibernation.\n\nI, however, don't fall into that camp. The bright-orange, refreshing spritz is one of my year-round orders. I've found that with a couple of easy tweaks, an Aperol-based drink can actually be very versatile.\n\nMy version of the classic recipe has become one of my favorite drinks in the fall and winter months, regardless of whether I'm on the sun-drenched Côte d'Azur or in my native drizzly England.\n\nI've seen various versions of this cocktail online with slightly different ratios and ingredients. In my experience, you don't need to be too strict about it.\n\nYou can alter the quantities based on your tastes and preferences, but for one simple spritz, I use the following:\n\nPour the above ingredients into a glass with plenty of ice, and you're done. There's no shaking required.\n\nAlthough the above measurements yield one cocktail, I've scaled the recipe and served it in a large punch bowl or pitcher when hosting friends at my home.\n\nYou can make it stronger by adding a splash of alcoholic spiced apple cider or go for a heavier Aperol pour.\n\nJust keep in mind that Aperol is a distilled spirit with 11% alcohol content, so even when it's diluted, it's worth being mindful of how many units you're having.\n\nTo garnish the drink, you can use a sprig of rosemary, cinnamon sticks, dehydrated orange slices, or cranberries. One of my favorite touches is making big ice cubes with an apple slice or a star anise inside.\n\nAnd if you really love a sweet cocktail, coat the rim of your glass with a bit of cinnamon sugar.\n\nI ran my recipe by dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who said that my festive spritz is a \"lighter, more hydrating option\" than many other popular holiday cocktails.\n\nAs your glass empties, top up your drink with soda water, which Ludlam-Raine explains counteracts alcohol's diuretic effect and helps keep you from getting dehydrated.\n\nIf you're not drinking at all, swap the Aperol for Crodini or Wilfred's aperitif and the prosecco for a nonalcoholic sparkling wine to create a tasty mocktail.\n\n\"I would totally drink this myself and recommend it to my patients,\" Ludlam-Raine told me. \"It's a great way of having a tasty drink without feeling like you're missing out if you're not having alcohol.\"\n\nAlthough Ludlam-Raine said that fruit juice adds flavor and antioxidants, you should be mindful of how much you use to keep your sugar intake in check.\n\nThis is especially true if you're having multiple … which I always am because this drink is that delicious.",

    "description": "The stars of \"Bridgerton\" season four wore daring sets, statement ball gowns, and chic suits at the world premiere in Paris on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "It's almost time to return to the ton, gentle reader.\n\nThe first episodes of season four of \"Bridgerton\" will drop on Netflix on January 29, with part two premiering on February 26. The season focuses on Benedict Bridgerton's love story with Sophie Baek. Luke Thompson will reprise his role as Benedict, while Yerin Ha will play Sophie.\n\nAhead of the show's Netflix release, the cast of \"Bridgerton\" gathered at the Palais Brongniart in Paris on Wednesday to celebrate the season's world premiere in red-carpet style.\n\nSome stars wore high-fashion outfits that nodded to their characters, while others missed the mark with lackluster suits or dresses that didn't fit the event.\n\nTake a look at some of the best and worst outfits from the \"Bridgerton\" season four premiere.\n\nHa, who stars as Sophie Baek in season four of \"Bridgerton,\" arrived at the premiere in an ice-blue gown designed by Prada.\n\nThe dress had a bedazzled halter neckline that matched the beading on a cutout on the bodice. The floor-length skirt featured two large pleats that cascaded into a train that trailed behind Ha as she walked the red carpet. Sparkly jewelry completed Ha's glamorous look.\n\nThe ensemble looked like a modern take on Cinderella's iconic blue dress. It was fitting since Julia Quinn's \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" upon which season four is based, is a retelling of \"Cinderella.\"\n\nAs he stepped into the leading role of \"Bridgerton,\" Thompson wore an all-black ensemble. He paired a black suit with a black button-down shirt, a black tie, and a black flower on his lapel. The only color on the look was a sparkly tie clip.\n\nThe look was stylish, but the black pieces blended so well that it became difficult to distinguish the different elements, particularly the flower and pin.\n\nSome pops of color may have made the outfit stand out more.\n\nJessie, who plays Eloise Bridgerton, chose an oversize suit for the event.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket and pants were black, but they were adorned with an assortment of flowers in various colors to give the suit some pop. Jessie paired the suit with a slicked-back hairstyle and several earrings and rings, adding a high-fashion edge.\n\nRosheuvel, who plays Queen Charlotte, wore a floor-length sweater dress from Sonney for the premiere. The burnt orange look had a slight sparkle and a cowl neckline, and Rosheuvel wore a matching coat and color-coordinated earrings.\n\nThe outfit was stylish, but it didn't feel formal enough for the red-carpet event. It may have worked better for a daytime press event, or Rosheuvel could have chosen a dress with the same silhouette in a different fabric.\n\nAlli, who plays Lord John Stirling on \"Bridgerton,\" wore an oversize black suit to the event.\n\nHe paired the suit with a white shirt, which he wore without a tie, and it peeked out from the cuffs of his jacket. He added a small silver brooch to his lapel for a chic addition.\n\nThe modern take on a tuxedo exuded high fashion.\n\nDodd, who married John Stirling as Francesca Bridgerton in season three of \"Bridgerton,\" chose a black Giambattista Valli Paris set for the premiere.\n\nThe top was a black, cropped shrug with a V-neck and a button closure that revealed her midriff. It was paired with a low-waisted, calf-length skirt that poofed out around her, giving it a ball-gown feel despite the modern silhouette.\n\nBlack heels and silver jewelry tied Dodd's stylish look together.\n\nThe Lady Danbury actor's custom Torlowei gown for the premiere was beautiful, with a high neckline and black lace detailing.\n\nHowever, Andoh's open-toed black shoes didn't quite match the dress, as they seemed less formal than the gown. Different shoes and statement earrings could have better accented the ensemble.\n\nLeung, who will make her debut on \"Bridgerton\" as Lady Araminta Gun, walked the red carpet in a black Toni Maticevski dress.\n\nIts strapless, scooped neckline formed points for a touch of drama before flowing into a corset bodice. The skirt was structured, poofing out around her waist in a dramatic ball-gown shape before flowing back into a pencil skirt. The center of the dress was made of ribbed fabric, adding dimension.\n\nChopard jewelry and strappy Christian Louboutin heels completed the look. Between the classic detailing, modern flair, and dark color, the dress was the perfect red-carpet companion for the wicked stepmother role Leung will play on the show.\n\nRhimes looked every bit the queen of the ton in the silver gown she wore to the premiere, which was styled by Dana Asher Levine.\n\nThe strapless gown had a slight point in the center of the straight neckline, and it cinched at Rhimes' waist with a belt. The entire gown was covered in silver and bronze sequins arranged in vertical strips, shimmering as Rhimes walked.\n\nThe pièce de résistance was a cape that coordinated with the gown. It sat on Rhimes' shoulder and flowed to the floor, giving the look a regal edge that was more than fitting for the occasion.",

In court filings, Amazon said the financing would \"saddle\" Saks with \"billions of dollars of obligation for no material benefit\" and improperly use the value of Saks Global's flagship entities to prop up other debtors at the expense of their creditors, including Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal judge overseeing Saks' bankruptcy case granted the company approval at a court hearing on Wednesday to tap an initial round of its financing.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Thursday, and representatives for Saks declined to comment.",

It was about a Ford worker who heckled him and was later suspended.\n\nThe incident raised questions about the limits of free speech in the workplace — and when companies can discipline workers for political protest.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to five experts, including four employment lawyers and an HR executive, to find out.\n\nTheir conclusion was blunt: an employee's words can quickly become fireable offenses.\n\nAll four lawyers said workers retain legal free speech rights under the Constitution, but those rights rarely protect speech in their workplace.\n\n\"With very few exceptions, employees in the private sector don't have free speech rights at work,\" Mark Kluger, a co-founding partner at New Jersey-based law firm Kluger Healey, told Business Insider.\n\nJessica Childress, a managing attorney at Washington, DC-based The Childress Firm, said workers often confuse who the First Amendment actually applies to. The best way to think about it, she said, is to divide government action from a private company's authority.\n\n\"The First Amendment's right to freedom of speech only applies to government actors, not private employers, such as Ford,\" she said. \"A private company can — with certain exceptions — limit what their employees say.\"\n\nThat distinction has played out in real-world cases before.\n\nIn 2017, Juli Briskman, a former marketing analyst for a government contractor, was fired from her job after professional photographers caught her giving Trump's motorcade the middle finger.\n\nEven though her action happened outside of the office, her lawsuit against her employer was tossed.\n\n\"Employers are legally allowed to regulate behavior that disrupts the workplace,\" said Jared Pope, an employment law attorney and CEO at Work Shield. \"That is why most organizations apply their codes of conduct consistently, even when speech happens off the clock or references public figures.\"\n\nStill, lawyers said workers generally have more protection if they express their political belief off-the-clock.\n\n\"If you are so inclined to protest, do it off-duty, off-premises, and off-company networks,\" Eric Kingsley, a partner at Kingsley Szamet Employment Lawyers, told Business Insider. \"An employer has the ability to discipline an employee for speech in matters of politics when it becomes misconduct.\"\n\nEach lawyer we talked to said that Ford was well within its rights to suspend the employee, T.J. Sabula.\n\nIn fact, some said the automaker may have displayed restraint by not outright firing the factory employee after the decision.\n\n\"It implies Ford is buying time,\" Kingsley added. \"Suspending the employee gives them a chance to investigate and make a decision that may not be as rash as laying off an employee.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Auto Workers, the union representing the workers in Sabula's plant, confirmed his suspension. Sabula, who has said he doesn't regret heckling Trump and is set to receive over $800,000 in crowdfunded support, has not responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLaura Dickerson, a vice president for the UAW, said the union was reviewing Ford's actions and said workers \"should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States.\"\n\nThe union also said Sabula \"believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"\n\nFord declined to comment on the suspension, saying it was \"a personnel matter.\"\n\n\"Ford is navigating a high-profile, politically charged moment,\" Lauren Winans, CEO of the HR consulting firm Next Level Benefits, said. \"The union's involvement likely influenced Ford's decision to suspend (not fire), because unilateral termination could lead to grievances and arbitration.\"\n\nFor workers wondering if they can get fired for speaking their mind at work, Kluger made it clear the answer is yes.\n\n\"Try telling your boss what you really think of them and see how long you remain employed,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon didn't have much trouble telling Warren Buffett he'd hired one of his top lieutenants.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO said that he called Buffett after hiring Todd Combs in December, who will lead a new $10 billion group at the bank and act as a special advisor to Dimon.\n\n\"It's a free country, and people make their own decisions,\" Dimon said in an interview at the Chamber of Commerce on Thursday. \"I did call Warren. He probably wouldn't have preferred it, but he said, 'if he's going anywhere, at least he's going to you.'\"\n\nCombs had been at Berkshire since 2010, where he served as CEO of Berkshire-owned Geico and as one of Buffett's two investment managers. In a press release, Buffett said that Combs \"has resigned to accept an interesting and important job at JPMorgan,\" and that the bank made \"a good decision.\"\n\nIn his own press release about the hire, Dimon called Combs, a former member of JPMorgan's board, \"one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known.\" Dimon has praised Buffett time and again over the years, saying that he \"represents everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself\" after the 95-year-old announced he would step down as Berkshire's CEO. Business Insider contacted Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan for comment.\n\nDimon, 69, addressed questions of his own future as a corporate leader during Thursday's interview. When asked whether he wants to stay in the job his characteristic five more years, Dimon said yes, \"at least.\"\n\n\"I love what I do. It's up to the board how long I do it. As long as I have the energy and the spit in the eye and the fire in the gut, yeah, I want to do it,\" he said.\n\nAnd he said he has absolutely no interest in becoming the Fed Chair: \"Absolutely, positively, no chance, no way, no how for any reason.\" (Dimon reiterated the importance of the central bank's independence in the interview, which has come into question in recent days given the Justice Department's investigation. He said that President Donald Trump also thinks we need an independent board.)\n\nIf a president offered him the job of Treasury Secretary, however, Dimon said he would \"consider it.\" He'd need to understand \"what they want and how they want to operate\" before making a decision.\n\nFor now, though, Dimon said he's happy to be his own boss.",

    "description": "Did you really violate the platform's policies, or is it a phishing scheme?",
    "fullText": "If you receive a warning on a LinkedIn post that your account has been restricted, don't engage with it. Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.\n\nAs reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.\n\nScammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended.\n\nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices.\n\nIf you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials.\n\nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.\n\nAs always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages.",

    "fullText": "Users of Supernatural got an unpleasant surprise this week: Meta has pulled the plug on its flagship virtual reality fitness app. Citing \"organizational changes,\" Meta says it will no longer release new content or update features for Supernatural.\n\nThe app is not shutting down completely however. Subscribers can still access Supernatural's existing library of Beat Saber-workouts, and Meta says it will maintain the platform and Facebook page, but no new workouts, features, or other content is planned.\n\nBoth users and critics have nearly universally praised Supernatural—CNet scored it 9 out of 10, it won both Fast Company's Best App award in 2020 and a Webby in 2023, and boasted celebrity tie-ins with Jane Fonda and Bon Jovi. Meta doesn't publish subscriber numbers for Supernatural, but there are over 110,000 members of Supernatural's Facebook community. Not enough, apparently, to warrant keeping the app going.\n\nIn 2021, Meta spent an estimated $400 million to purchase Within, Supernatural's developer, even battling the FTC to make the deal, and the app was a heavily promoted part of the company's overall \"Metaverse\" strategy.\n\nThe shuttering of Supernatural is part of a larger shift at Meta. This week, the company laid off 1,500 people—about 10% of the staff—from Reality Labs, Meta's hardware and virtual reality division. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables. This is part of that effort,” a Meta spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlong with cuts at Supernatural, Meta is closing three studios behind some of the most prominent, high-end VR games: Armature, who brought Resident Evil 4 to VR, Sanzaru, the studio behind Asgard’s Wrath, and Twisted Pixel, creators of Deadpool VR.",

It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.\n\nThe weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one.\n\nAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears.\n\nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool defender Andy Robertson would like to remain at Liverpool beyond this summer when his contract expires - but says he's \"a player who wants to play\".\n\nRobertson, 31, added that nothing has been decided yet, despite discussions with the club.\n\nAsked if he would like to stay, the Scotland international said: \"Yes, but it's a difficult question.\n\n\"I've got five months left and we need to see what the option is to stay or if there's options to go and things like that. I need to sit down with my family and decide.\n\n\"After a stressful summer, I'm just trying to enjoy being a part of it and being a Liverpool player.\n\n\"I wanted to qualify for the World Cup and thankfully we've managed to do that. I need to see what myself and my family wants going forward.\"\n\nRobertson, who signed for Liverpool for £8m from Hull City in 2017 during Jurgen Klopp's reign, has played 362 times for the Reds but has started just four Premier League games this season.\n\nHungary international Milos Kerkez, 22, has been Liverpool's first-choice left-back since making the move from Bournemouth for £40m last summer.\n\nAsked if the amount of game time he gets between now and the end of the season would have an impact on his future, Robertson said: \"I can focus on the last eight and a half years. I think Jurgen Klopp left me out for one game and I was raging. So I'm a player who wants to play.\n\n\"I've played through injuries. I've played when I'm not 100% fit. I've played when I've only been 50/40/30% fit for this club and my country. I always want to be on the grass and playing and obviously now that's not happening, so that's what is different.\n\n\"I have a different role here this season which I'm getting enjoyment out of, but at the end of the day, footballers want to play and if anyone is sat happy on the bench, then they don't belong at any football club.\"",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh's cricketers have begun a boycott of all forms of cricket in response to comments made by a national cricket board director, which have led to his removal.\n\nBoth of Thursday's matches in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) have been postponed, while the national side's participation in February's T20 World Cup is in doubt.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced it has removed M Nazmul Islam from his position as chair of its financial committee after he suggested players should shoulder the financial burden if Bangladesh were to withdraw from the World Cup.\n\nThe comments came amid political tensions between Bangladesh and host nation India.\n\nThe BCB has formally requested that all Bangladesh's matches are staged elsewhere in order to participate in the tournament.\n\nAll of Pakistan's fixtures are to be played in Sri Lanka, with the BCB seeking a similar arrangement.\n\nAsked about the financial implications should Bangladesh be required to withdraw, Islam said: \"Why [would there be]? Are we asking them for the crores and crores of taka [Bangladesh's currency] that we are spending on them? Answer me first.\n\n\"We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything in different places. Have we got any international awards? What have we done at any level?\n\n\"Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn't play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?\"\n\nOne Bangladeshi crore is equivalent to just over £60,000.\n\nIslam's comments drew a swift response from Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB).\n\n\"The remark made by the BCB director has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly and it's not acceptable,\" Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We demand his resignation. If he doesn't resign before tomorrow's match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow.\"\n\nNeither side arrived for Thursday's match between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express, with that fixture and the later match between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans confirmed as being postponed.\n\nThe BCB, in removing Islam from his position, stated: \"Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president has decided to release Mr Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.\n\n\"The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority. The board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt said all cricketers should \"display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game\" and called for BPL matches to be played as planned.\n\nBangladesh's T20 World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 7 February against West Indies in Kolkata, with a match against England on Saturday, 14 February due to take place at the same venue, Eden Gardens.\n\nThe Bangladesh Premier League has six group games left to play, leading into a four-match knockout stage, finishing with a final in Dhaka on Friday, 23 January.",

    "fullText": "There were no tears from Mohamed Salah when the final whistle went in Tangier as Egypt fell at the semi-final hurdle. Just a little smile, but one no doubt hiding immense disappointment.\n\nYet again, his Egypt side had failed at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) and, yet again, they had fallen against Senegal and Sadio Mane - Salah's ex-Liverpool team-mate.\n\nAcross the five games Salah started in Morocco, the 33-year-old scored four goals as he carried his nation to the semi-finals.\n\nAfter their quarter-final win against the Ivory Coast, Salah described it as the \"best camp\" he'd ever had.\n\n\"We're all close, we love each other, we hang out together, the humour is unbelievable, and we work hard both on and off the pitch,\" said Salah.\n\nSalah is expected to return to Merseyside, where uncertainty still remains over his future, following Saturday's third-place play-off against Nigeria in Casablanca.\n\nSalah last started a game for Liverpool on 26 November in the Champions League against PSV, which Arne Slot's side lost 4-1.\n\nSince then, Liverpool are 11 games unbeaten (W6, D5), though the performances have been questionable - with Slot admitting last week he did not \"completely disagree\" with suggestions the Reds' football has been \"dull and boring\" during that period.\n\nIt is also over a month since Salah gave an explosive mixed zone interview at Leeds, where he accused Liverpool of \"throwing him under the bus\" after he was benched for three games in a row, and claimed his relationship with Slot had broken down.\n\nHe was subsequently left out for Liverpool's trip to Inter Milan but was not fined and returned to the squad against Brighton a few days later, coming off the bench in the first half when Joe Gomez was injured.\n\nSalah got an assist in the second half and was given a warm reception by the Anfield crowd, before staying to applaud all four sides of the ground after full-time as they serenaded their \"Egyptian King\" with his familiar song. That was his last appearance before joining up with his national team.\n\nSlot insisted after that there was \"no issue to resolve\", with Curtis Jones also revealing Salah had apologised to his team-mates for the fallout from his interview.\n\nIn his absence Liverpool have not lost a game, but they have lost striker Alexander Isak to a lower leg injury until at least March, while defender Conor Bradley has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.",

You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.\nIn a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal and reported on by Medical Xpress, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects \"excessive gaming\" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that \"high gamers\"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.",

Dan Troccoli, a public school teacher at Justice Page Middle School and union activist, says that the battle for Minneapolis is not a one-sided rout by ICE—if it was, there would not be these threats to impose martial law.\n\n“Many people around the city have been going around patrolling and keeping an eye on these agents,” he told me. “There are estimates as high as 10,000 people that have been involved in the city in these efforts in the last six weeks. Given the legacy of the uprisings after [the 2020 police murder of] George Floyd, people in the city have been activated for years now. I would argue we were Trump’s target for that reason, but it’s not going exactly like they planned, and people need to know that.”\n\nOne example of things “not going exactly like they planned” happened at Roosevelt High School. Only hours after the ICE killing of Renee Good, ICE tried to storm the gates of Roosevelt, when a person they were pursuing ran onto school grounds just as students were heading home. Instead of retreating, ICE assaulted and gassed students and educators. But their attack was met. “In our union, in the Minneapolis Federation of Educators, there has been now, for about a year and a half, a group of educators calling themselves the Deportation Defense Group,” Trocolli explained. “So at Roosevelt, they were ready, and we had a network of people ready to go on this, and we have been doing training around how to be an observer, how to go on patrol, what are the most risky times for students to be dropped off or picked up, and how can we do mutual aid for families who can’t even pick up their kids. So the staff members at Roosevelt were outside of the building ready to ID ICE and physically get in between them and their students.”\n\nBut ICE aggressively pushed forward and then struck and sprayed chemical agents on students and staff. After all of that, ICE arrested one educator, who was then let go hours after the union’s lawyers were on the scene.\n\nThe Minneapolis teachers’ unions (there are two) have been front and center in this fight: opening up their halls for meetings every night, partnering with parent organizations, and holding training sessions.\n\n“This past weekend,” Troccoli recalled, “we had a training at one of our high schools, and there were something like 300 parents and staff mixed together, working together to try and organize in their buildings. At recent meetings of this same network of Unionists in MFE, there have been something like 60 to 70 percent of schools represented. And I would imagine it’s much higher now since Renee’s murder, with more buildings getting activated, involved, mostly out of fear and concern for their students’ safety.”\n\nTroccoli stressed that the union’s leadership and active response to the crisis comes from having a unique union president: Marcia Howard. Howard taught at Roosevelt for 20 years. When George Floyd was murdered, she, still a teacher, “was the coordinator, and hub of George Floyd Square.”\n\nHoward took the entire year off then to do this work, turning George Floyd Square into a kind of autonomous zone, and both teachers’ unions made sure she was paid during this time. This drew her closer to the union. Howard, with grassroots encouragement, ran for union vice president and president. “She’s just been a fiery and amazing leader for our union,” Troccoli said, “especially in terms of trying to marry union struggles with other social justice struggles in the city.”\n\nIn the face of this resistance, ICE is upping its oppression. Agents are showing up at the homes of people who follow ICE in their cars even at a safe distance are—no matter their citizenship. Troccoli also said that when these ICE-watchers leave their cars, phones in hand, to document their violence, they have been hit, without warning, with mace, pepper balls, and “nonlethal” bullet rounds.\n\nAnd yet ICE violence has yielded not compliance and pacification but even more resistance. Troccoli said, “A number of unions in the city are now committing to a day-long strike on January 23.” This call already includes the backings of some of the biggest unions in the city including, according to PayDay Report, The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1005, SEIU Local 26, UNITE HERE Local 17, CWA Local 7250, and St. Paul Federation of Educators Local 28, with more coming. “We’re not sure exactly what’s going to happen that day yet,” Troccoli said. “But it’s happening.\n\nAs far as what people can do Troccoli told me that social media support definitely keeps spirits up but “in addition to appreciation, we want emulation. We need that out there in the streets in every city”",

    "fullText": "We can turn the tide against Trump—but only with mass action and courageous leadership.\n\nShortly after dropping her 6-year-old son off at school, Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.\n\nRepublican leaders attempted to smear Good as a “domestic terrorist” and claim that Ross acted in “self-defense.” But the incident was caught on video, and we all saw it: an ICE agent murdering a 37-year-old mother. Good was also a US citizen, the demographic that ICE is claiming to protect.\n\nICE’s purpose in Minnesota has been to sow chaos and terror, with a focus in Minneapolis, one of the most diverse areas in the state. Many residents feel like they’re living under occupation. ICE agents are snatching residents from bus stops. Black and brown US citizens are carrying their passports everywhere to keep from being kidnapped by federal agents. Businesses are struggling as people are afraid to show up to work. Schools are on lockdown as ICE shows up to harass and assault students and educators. And now ICE has shot and killed a neighbor.\n\nWhile the violence of occupation is not the standard in Minneapolis, these recent events feel all too familiar. Good’s murder occurred just six blocks from where Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd. A badge does not give you a license to kill with impunity. We did not quietly accept the murder of George Floyd in 2020, and we will not accept the murder of Renee Good now.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has outrageously claimed that ICE is helping to keep people safe. What’s become blatantly clear is that ICE is the biggest threat to our community’s safety. That’s why the first demand from Minneapolis residents has been for ICE to leave.\n\nThousands of residents, including Good, have been organizing to protect our neighbors. Delivering groceries to families, so no one is abducted while trying to feed their loved ones. Walking kids to schools so families aren’t torn apart on the way home. Distributing whistles, so we can alert our neighbors when ICE is on our streets. These actions aren’t always visible, but they are helping to keep families together.\n\nAs a local elected official, I am working with my colleagues to push our governor to take action to keep families in their homes by instituting an eviction moratorium. Governor Tim Walz can show the rest of the nation that Democrats can resist Trump and protect residents targeted by the administration’s cruel policies. Hundreds of families are unable to safely go to work, and shouldn’t have to choose between keeping a roof over their heads and risking being permanently separated from their loved ones.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty announced Friday that they are conducting an independent investigation into the killing of Good, a crucial step as we cannot trust Trump’s agencies to conduct a fair arrest, investigation, or trial.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nBut to truly put an end to ICE and the rising tide of fascism under Trump, the Democratic Party must take immediate and bold action for the following:\n\nWinning these demands require more than just voting. We need national-level labor organizing for strikes and shutdowns to interrupt the economy and force a change of course until we can all live free from the fear of being kidnapped or shot by armed agents. The ICE Out of Minnesota Economic Blackout planned for January 23 is a great start.\n\nBecause while the eyes of the world have once again turned to Minneapolis after a man with a badge killed one of our neighbors, this is a national problem.\n\nLess than 48 hours after an ICE agent killed Good, federal agents shot two people in Portland. They’ve already targeted Los Angeles, Chicago, and New Orleans. It could be your city next. As long as ICE exists, nobody is safe—not even a 37-year-old mom and US citizen. It’s going to take all of us doing our parts to end this violence.\n\nThis moment will go down in history, but we have a choice about how. If we do nothing, this will mark the beginning of a period where federal agents can kill us with impunity.\n\nBut if we act, we can make this the moment that finally turned the tide against rising fascism and ended Trump’s attacks on our communities. The time for mass action is now—let’s make this the last life stolen by ICE.",
