Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf you’re looking for someone inside the Indiana locker room who’s caught up in the moment, Aiden Fisher is not your guy.\n\nThe accolades, the metrics, the talk of historic runs and national relevance, Fisher hears it all. He just doesn’t care about any of it right now. Not with one game left. Not with the Miami Hurricanes standing across the field.\n\n“It won’t mean really anything unless we walk away with a win in this game,” Fisher said. Simple. Flat. No drama. “All that historical stuff doesn’t really mean anything to us right now.”\n\nThat mindset didn’t magically appear during a postseason run. He carried it to Bloomington when he followed Curt Cignetti from James Madison. And over time, it’s seeped into everything, even conversations with his mom.\n\nMore: Indiana fans think Fernando Mendoza eats like a child because of a viral fake post\n\n“I caught myself using the word ‘complacent,’” Fisher said, laughing. “I was like, wow, I’ve been with Cig way too long. Everything he talks about is true in football and in life. Complacency kills.”\n\nEven with a national championship on deck, Fisher insists the approach doesn’t change. Same field. Same pads. Same four quarters. “It’s just football,” he said.\n\nMore: Fernando Mendoza sends clear message on Indiana's first national championship berth\n\nStill, he knows what this is. He’s made sure younger players understand it too. Opportunities like this don’t come back around. One week. Total focus. No shortcuts.\n\n“Prepare like it’s your last game,” Fisher said. “So you can walk off with no regrets.”\n\nIndiana has already changed how it’s viewed nationally.\n\nFisher isn’t interested in how the story sounds unless it ends the right way.\n\nFernando Mendoza takes the stage as Indiana fans flood Atlanta\n\nMark Cuban admits to backing Indiana’s transfer portal class\n\nFernando Mendoza rejected Miami’s — now he’s one win from a national title\n\nIndiana tries to become college football’s first 16-0 team in 132 years",

    "fullText": "Riccardo Adami will no longer serve as Lewis Hamilton's race engineer at Ferrari as the Italian has taken up a new role within the Formula 1 team's young driver programme.\n\nAdami, who was previously the race engineer for both Sebastian Vettel and Carlos Sainz at the team, will now oversee the testing of previous cars running for the Ferrari Driver Academy and thus relinquishes his trackside role.\n\nHamilton was paired with Adami for his first season at the Prancing Horse, although the partnership was put under scrutiny when apparent early communication issues were publicly broadcast on F1's world feed.\n\nWhile the two achieved early success with Hamilton's sprint race victory in China, the seven-time champion's season petered out with a series of Q1 eliminations.\n\nIt had been suggested that the relationship between Hamilton and Adami had lacked the requisite chemistry owing to the occasional terseness over the radio, although this was denied by both driver and team.\n\nA communique provided by the team stated that: \"Scuderia Ferrari HP announces that Riccardo Adami has moved to a new role within the Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy as Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy and Test Previous Cars Manager, where his extensive trackside experience and Formula 1 expertise contributes to the development of future talent and to strengthening performance culture across the program.\n\n\"Scuderia Ferrari HP would like to thank Riccardo for his commitment and contribution to his trackside role and wishes him every success in his new position.\n\n\"The appointment of the new Race Engineer for car #44 will be announced in due course.\"\n\nAdami had been Vettel's race engineer at the Toro Rosso team, and had also fulfilled a similar role for the likes of Daniel Ricciardo, Sebastien Buemi, and Vitantonio Liuzzi within the Faenza squad. He then reunited with Vettel upon leaving Toro Rosso in 2015.\n\nSebastian Vettel reveals advice he gave Lewis Hamilton for Ferrari F1 move\n\nFerrari insists relationship with Lewis Hamilton isn't as bad as it seems\n\nAfter 2025's Australian Grand Prix, Hamilton responded to the assertions that radio traffic between the pair suggested that the two had not meshed, suggesting that people should \"go and listen to the radio calls with others and their engineers, they're far worse\".\n\nFerrari's head of track engineering Matteo Togninalli added during the Qatar weekend that \"what you see from outside is worse\" than the reality of their collaboration.\n\nRegardless, Hamilton will have to form a new working relationship with another engineer; it is unknown whether Ferrari will seek to promote from within, or hire externally.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "The Badgers got another addition to their pass rush on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "The Wisconsin Badgers got another addition in the transfer portal on Thursday night, as Hope College pass rusher Liam Danitz committed to the program while on an official visit to Madison.\n\nDanitz, a 6’5, 230-pound edge rusher who hails from Michigan, had a monster year for D-III Hope College this year, recording 15 sacks and 21 tackles for loss. In the two prior seasons, Danitz had recorded 12 sacks and 18.5 tackles for loss. While he is currently out of eligibility, Danitz is expected to apply for a waiver, as one of his four seasons went towards track-and-field.\n\nThis is a bold move from the Badgers, as they’re taking a chance on a D-III pass rusher with tantalizing traits. Danitz has elite speed, running a 10.55 100-meter dash and 20.92 200-meter dash in college. Now, it’s on Wisconsin’s staff to get the most out of that and find a way to get him on the field.\n\nDanitz had been receiving some serious Power 4 interest after his track numbers were released, but he visited Wisconsin first and committed to the Badgers then and there.\n\nWisconsin has added a few different edge rushers this offseason. They added jumbo edge Justus Boone, an Arkansas transfer, who lines up at 6’5, 290 pounds and can play on the inside. They also got Tennessee freshman transfer Jayden Loftin, for whom the Badgers were a serious suitor last year in his high school recruitment.\n\nNow, they’re adding a third with Danitz, getting some experience in a relatively young room.",

    "description": "Golden Boy finds itself in a legal battle with yet another of its top stars.",
    "fullText": "Golden Boy finds itself in a legal battle with yet another of its top stars.\n\nOscar De La Hoya's promotional company, which has been sued in recent years by Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez and Ryan Garcia, now finds itself on the end of a legal challenge by WBC interim champion Vergil Ortiz Jr.\n\nA lawsuit was filed on behalf of Ortiz in a Nevada court on Thursday, asking for Declaratory relief and claiming breach of contract and interference with prospective economic advantage.\n\nOrtiz signed a three-year promotional contract with Golden Boy in May 2024, earning a minimum guarantee of $1 million per fight. Lawyers for Ortiz claim that, under the agreement, Ortiz can terminate his contract with Golden Boy if the promoter no longer has an active broadcast deal with DAZN and has not secured an exclusive distribution agreement with an alternative broadcaster.\n\nGolden Boy's contract with DAZN ended on Dec. 31, 2025, and has not been renewed yet, although the pair are in talks for a possible extension. Lawyers for Golden Boy argue that Ortiz is not yet a free agent because they are still in negotiations with DAZN for a new media rights agreement.\n\nAt the center of this dispute is one of boxing's most anticipated fights.\n\nOrtiz and Jaron \"Boots\" Ennis faced off in the ring after the former's win over Erickson Lubin on Nov. 8.\n\nNegotiations have continued in the months since but a bout between the pair has yet to materialize. In recent weeks, it became apparent that the conflict between Ortiz's promoter, De La Hoya, and his manager, Rick Mirigian, was not helping matters along.\n\nMirigian has claimed he has the right to negotiate on Ortiz's behalf directly with promoter Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Boxing because of the belief from Ortiz's side's that they are a promotional free agent. De La Hoya has made multiple videos and posts on his Instagram page asserting that he has the exclusive promotional rights for Ortiz Jr.'s fights, hence the legal battle that appears set to ensue.\n\nAccording to Hearn, he and De La Hoya agreed on a 45%/45% purse split — with the remaining 10% going to the winner — to match the pair during a meeting with the Golden Boy chief and DAZN executives in 2025, but De La Hoya has since asked for a 55%-35% deal, with 10% to the winner. De La Hoya's feuds with Hearn, Turki Alalshikh and other promoters have prevented De La Hoya from working on behalf of Ortiz to maximize his revenue opportunities, it is claimed in the suit.\n\nDAZN has not renewed Golden Boy's contract yet, in part because of the company's failure to make a fight with Ennis next, Uncrowned has learned. A highly-placed DAZN source told Uncrowned that a contest between Ortiz and Ennis is the only one that it wants to see next for the boxers, and it is putting significant pressure on De La Hoya and Hearn to make the match.\n\nGolden Boy has informed Ortiz that it is the only fight it wants to make for the boxer, which is allegedly a violation of his contract that requires a minimum of three potential opponents.\n\nTiming is key. While De La Hoya's contract with DAZN has recently expired, Hearn's media rights deal with DAZN has just six months left and is also in talks for a renewal. With Top Rank and Premier Boxing Champions recently losing their network deals and finding themselves unable to secure adequate replacements, it is apparent that De La Hoya and Hearn will not want to find themselves searching for a new boxing broadcaster.",

    "fullText": "Ferrari and Mercedes are preparing for a transformative 2026 Formula 1 season, with both teams entering the new era of regulations under intense scrutiny and high expectations.\n\nThe major power unit and aerodynamic changes introduced by the FIA will demand a full redesign of their cars, setting the stage for one of the most anticipated seasons in recent memory.\n\nFerrari has officially confirmed that its 2026 Formula 1 car will be called the SF26. It will be driven by Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, marking Hamilton’s second season with the team.\n\nThe Maranello-based outfit is scheduled to unveil the SF26 on January 23, 2026, just ahead of pre-season testing in Barcelona.\n\nAccording to Ferrari team principal Frederic Vasseur, the new car represents a “fresh start” for the Scuderia, fully adapted to the sweeping 2026 regulation changes that will reshape the sport’s hybrid power units and aerodynamic principles.\n\nFerrari’s focus has been on ensuring its power unit meets the new FIA guidelines, which emphasize sustainability, electrical efficiency, and reduced drag.\n\nWhile specific design features remain confidential, team sources have suggested the car is being developed with an emphasis on energy recovery performance and mechanical balance.\n\nMercedes has confirmed that its 2026 contender will be called the W17 E Performance, continuing the team’s naming convention. The car will be unveiled on January 22, 2026, one day before Ferrari’s launch.\n\nTeam principal Toto Wolff has described the upcoming season as “a fresh opportunity to innovate and redefine performance under a completely new rulebook.”\n\nThe Brackley outfit has emphasized reliability and adaptability as key priorities for the W17. Mercedes engineers have spent much of the past year developing their next-generation hybrid power unit to align with the new 50/50 internal combustion-to-electric power balance mandated by the FIA.\n\nThe team has also conducted early performance simulations, focusing on optimizing energy efficiency and aerodynamic flexibility.\n\nBoth Ferrari and Mercedes will enter the 2026 season with renewed optimism and extensive technical overhauls.\n\nFerrari’s new direction under Vasseur and Hamilton’s leadership gives the team fresh momentum, while Mercedes’ deep experience with hybrid systems may offer an early edge as the new regulations take effect.\n\nAs both cars prepare to hit the track for the first time in Barcelona, the competition between Ferrari and Mercedes could define the early stages of Formula 1’s new era.",

His answers tell you a lot about the kind of players he wants to be.\n\n“Number three, Thiago Silva. I used to watch him back in school on Youtube and get in trouble. For me he just has everything. He can head, he can play, when he was in his prime he was quick, he was strong, a leader. I’ve always loved Thiago.”\n\n“Number two I’d go for Sergio Ramos, just a winner. A leader. Always wants to put his body on the line. I used to watch a lot of El Clasico and he would stand out,” the defender continued.\n\n“Number one? John Terry, legend of the club. What he did in the Premier League, what he did for the club. He helped me out a lot when I was younger and I would train with the first team. He would be the one to put his arm around the young players, to help them gain a bit of confidence, you know.”\n\nA very good set of answers there. It never ceases to amaze us how many nice things you’ll find everyone saying about JT who has worked at Chelsea.\n\nYou can see Chalobah speaking in the clip embedded here:\n\nWhile Chelsea delay, their sister club is getting into gear. Strasbourg have already agreed a €7m deal for a talented attacking midfielder who will apparently take his medical today.\n\nChelsea are suddenly seemingly interested in January transfer moves, and Matt Law of the Daily Telegraph has a big update on a potential sale the Blues could made.",

Although Stephen has spent his entire 17-year career with Golden State, it says a lot that he's seemingly still considering returning to his hometown to join the Hornets.\n\nAfter this season, Curry has one more year on his current deal with the Warriors and will then become a free agent ahead of the 2027-28 season.

Warren also scored five total touchdowns in his rookie campaign. His 817 receiving yards ranked fifth among all NFL tight ends, while his 487 yards after catch ranked second among all tight ends, behind only Cardinals’ Trey McBride.\n\nTyler Warren 10 Games, 50 REC, 617 YDS, 4 Total TDs. \n\n2025 Mid Season Highlights. https://t.co/kX32daI8N4 pic.twitter.com/h45UaCMs2m\n\n— Football Performances (@NFLPerformances) November 13, 2025\n\nThe Pro Bowl nod places Warren in rare company, becoming just the 18th rookie tight end in NFL history to earn a Pro Bowl selection and the first Colt to do so in the Indianapolis-era of the franchise. Warren joins a pair of teammates, including running back Jonathan Taylor and left guard Quenton Nelson as Indy’s third player invited to the Pro Bowl. Warren will replace Raiders’ Brock Bowers, who is unable to compete due to an injury.\n\nWarren’s rapid ascent shows just how valuable he was within an offense built around its established stars, and a Pro Bowl stage is now waiting to move into its next chapter.\n\ncheers to the pro bowler. pic.twitter.com/HWa7tmuSzY\n\n— Indianapolis Colts (@Colts) January 16, 2026",

    "title": "As John Harbaugh euphoria fades, new Giants coach will face some tough questions | Politi",
    "description": "Harbaugh Mania is understandable. But here's a reality check.",
    "fullText": "John Harbaugh is exactly the leader the Giants needed to hire at this point in their long history to bring a level of credibility and competence that this franchise has been lacking for more than a decade. Harbaugh Mania, however, is just a wee bit over the top.\n\nThese two things can be true at the same time.\n\nGiants fans who have sat through a string of 10-loss seasons with a collection of overmatched head coaches on the sideline have every right to celebrate the news that the former Super Bowl champion picked their team over a host of suitors.\n\nBut if they’re picking their spot on the sidewalk in the Canyon of Heroes, ready for the confetti to start falling, they probably need a reality check.\n\nOh, they might not want one, which is perfectly understandable. If you’re a Giants fan who wants this honeymoon to last straight into next season without even considering that Harbaugh might not be Vince Lombardi reincarnated, just stop reading here. We’ll see you in September, that wide smile still plastered on your face, at MetLife Stadium.\n\nIf you’re ready for a little cold water to be thrown on this party — not a bucket full, just a thimble! — then, please, read on.\n\nHarbaugh can expect his introductory press conference to feel more like a coronation than an inquisition given the current state of the Giants — maybe not a Jacksonville-level love fest, but still, a happy occasion nonetheless.\n\nBut there are some tough questions that Harbaugh needs to answer about how his time in Baltimore ended and how that relates to his plans for his new team. They are questions that, hopefully, Giants officials asked him while they wined-and-dined him at aa Route 17 Greek restaurant.\n\nWhat happened at the end with Lamar Jackson? Did your relationship with the Ravens star quarterback sour in your final season together? With Jackson starting, the Ravens had a 3-6 playoff record and just reaching one AFC title game appearance. Is there any regret that you didn’t reach a single Super Bowl with a two-time MVP who was in the prime of his career?\n\nNo head coach has won a Super Bowl with two different franchises. Your victory in the big game happened in 2013, a lifetime ago in professional football. What makes you confident that your second act can be as good as your first?\n\nAt 63, you likely will start 2025 as the second-oldest coach in professional football. Age is just a number, of course, and one could argue that the best coaches (Andy Reid, Sean Payton) are your contemporaries. But coaching is quickly becoming a young man’s profession. How will you continue to adapt to the changes in the sport?\n\nThe Giants, under general manager Joe Schoen, have a long list of failures in the draft and free agency. You wouldn’t be here if you didn’t believe in him, to some extent. What gives you confidence that he can build a championship roster? And, if you believe that the talent isn’t there in Year 1, are you ready to exert your considerable influence to force a change?\n\nIn the event of a disagreement on roster decisions, do you have assurances that you’ll ultimately be the one with final say over the general manager? Is that written into your contract?\n\nSince 2021, the Ravens have lost 12 games while leading by seven or more points in the fourth quarter, the most in NFL history in a five-year span. You are taking over a team that suffered its own collection of late-game losses this season. Why was this an issue in Baltimore, and why will it be different here?\n\nJaxson Dart proved to be a dangerous runner in rookie season. He also missed time because of concussions and, despite numerous hard hits to the head, has taken an almost dismissive attitude about protecting himself. How do you harness that part of his game while protecting him against injuries that could shorten his career?\n\nTodd Monken, who is expected to follow you to New Jersey as offensive coordinator, recently said that he “didn’t coach Lamar (Jackson) well enough” as the NFL’s top offense regressed in 2025. Given the Giants’ long-term success rides on developing Dart, are there any concerns about Monken’s ability to handle this important role?\n\nFew coaches have ever arrived in the New York market with more hype than you. The Giants needed to win two meaningless games at the end of last season just to finish 4-13. How will you manage expectations if the team’s performance can’t match the current level of excitement in the fan base?\n\nAgain: It is okay to be excited about John Harbaugh become the Giants coach. In some ways, this might be the franchise’s biggest January victory since the days that Tom Coughlin and Eli Manning where leading it to those third and fourth Lombardi Trophies.\n\nBut the new guy arrives with some fair questions — about the past and the future — that he’ll face in the coming weeks and months. If he really is going to live up to Harbaugh Mania, he’ll have all the right answers.",

I locked everything up.”\n\n🤜🤛 Ford mates backing Nani Roma after his right suspension broke just before the ASS. #Dakar2026 pic.twitter.com/zava25BC7B\n\n— DAKAR RALLY (@dakar) January 16, 2026\n\nThe car was severely damaged, and several Ford drivers, including Romain Dumas, Mitch Guthrie and Martin Prokop had to step in to help the Spaniard.\n\nLe Mans 24 Hours and Pikes Peak winner Dumas offered his Raptor's front axle in order to help Roma repair his car and reach the finish line.\n\n“Today is, surely, the hardest day of my career. I don’t believe in miracles… but today I do,” he told the media. “Without the team I wouldn’t be here. It’s impossible.\"\n\nHowever, there was more drama for Roma, with his Ford running out of fuel just seven kilometres from the bivouac.\n\nThis is when Ebro driver Laia Sanz came into the picture. Roma had overtaken her on the route and asked for help. In a striking act of sportsmanship, the Catalan driver towed his Ford to the finish line - a gesture that saved a podium place.\n\n“Yesterday I was saying there are no miracles… this is one,\" he added.\n\nWith just the final stage and more than 100km of timed running remaining, Roma is more than 15 minutes behind Al-Attiyah, who is on course for a sixth career win in Dakar.\n\nWinning the prestigious Touareg trophy is now almost a pipe dream for Roma, holding second place after what he endured feels like a moral victory.\n\n“There comes a moment when you no longer think about the podium.

    "description": "There are some familiar names playing in the NFL playoffs this weekend",
    "fullText": "Last week, Las Vegas Raiders general manager Jon Spytek noted that there were plenty of former players still playing. Now , as the playoffs move onto the divisional round, let’s look at the former Raiders still playing, presented in alphabetical order:\n\nDefensive tackle Andrew Billings.\n\nBillings is a Bears’ backup who started 14 games for the Raiders in 2022. He signed with Chicago as a free agent in 2023.\n\nThe backup played for the Raiders in 2o22 and signed with the Broncos in 2023.\n\nDefensive end Denico Autry, Tackle Trent Brown, tight end Harrison Bryant.\n\nAutry is a backup. He played for the Raiders from 2014-17 after being undrafted. Brown started seven games this season. He was a high-dollar free-agent signing for the Raiders in 2019. His tenure there didn’t go well. Bryant is a deep backup. He spent 2024 with the Raiders as a free agent. He signed with the Eagles in March and then was traded to Houston.\n\nWide receiver Davante Adams, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.\n\nAdams is a major part of the Rams’ offense and is playing well in his first season there. Adams had an infamous entire for the Raiders from 2022-24 when the team traded for him and then shipped him out less than three years late. In the end, his time in Las Vegas isn’t looked upon fondly by many. Garoppolo spent one rocky season with the Raiders, in 2023.\n\nTight end Austin Hooper, tackle Thayer Munford, linebackers K’Lavon Chaisson and Robert Spillane.\n\nHooper is a backup. He was a backup for the Raiders in 2023. Munford was a seventh0rround pick by the Raiders and he played there from 2022-24. He signed with the Patriots this season, reuniting with former Raiders’ head coach Josh McDaniels, who is the Patriots’ offensive coordinator this year after being released. Chaisson played 15 games with the Raiders last season and he signed with New England this offseason. He has been a key contributor. Spillane, who the Raiders’ signed in free agency in 2023, signed in free agency with the Patriots in 2025. He is a big part of the New England defense. He is under contract for two more seasons.\n\nHe was the No. 4 overall draft pick by the Raiders in 2019. He had an underwhelming tenure there from 2019-2o22. He is a deep backup for the 49ers.\n\nHe never made the Raiders’ roster as an undrafted free agent in 2023. After a strong preseason, the Seahawks claimed him off waivers and he has become a lynchpin of the the Seattle defense this season.",

    "fullText": "I agree with many of my APC brethren that there is not a clear upgrade from Matt LaFleur out there at the moment, and that bringing him back is probably, objectively, the correct thing to do.\n\nHowever, I’m also getting pretty sick of the Green Bay Packers playing like losers. LaFleur is a great play designer, which is why the Packers often build big leads, but as Mike Tyson once said, “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.” When the Packers inevitably get punched in the face, all they do is turtle.\n\nThe nflfastR model’s Win Percentage metrics are, like their Expected Points Added (EPA) cousin, based on quantifying how often a team goes on to win in a given situation based on what has actually happened over the last three to four seasons. It’s not perfect, of course, as an elite team with an explosive offense, like the Drake Maye Pats, for instance, is more likely to wage an improbable comeback than the Titans. But it’s still generally useful in providing context on where you stand in a given game.\n\nAnd so my point here isn’t that in all of these Packer games, they had a 90 percent-plus chance of winning. It’s not that exact. However, I don’t think we really need to be THAT exact with our percentages when discussing this problem! My point is that they were VERY likely to win all of these.\n\nAnd they didn’t win any of them. And that’s weird. Yes, football is filled with randomness, and of course, once the Packers lost Micah Parsons, they became less capable of closing out games on the defensive side, reasonably so.\n\nAnd remember, only three of these came after the Parsons injury.\n\nAnd it’s not necessarily even a problem limited to this year. It was more pronounced this year, to be sure, but…\n\nThey’ve had some real collapses. And maybe that last one doesn’t seem quite as bad as the 49ers were ALSO above 75% to win it for much of the game, but the Packers rallied, and had the lead and the ball with six minutes to go in field goal range. Just six minutes from victory! And of course, it was conservative play calling and a missed Anders Carlson field goal that got them, because of course it was.\n\nIt’s one thing to just run into a superior opponent and lose the game, but teams are NOT supposed to lose quite so many games that they were winning when they were at least evenly matched enough that they should have pulled it off. And it wasn’t the first time it happened against the 49ers in the playoffs.\n\nI know that every team has its failures. Only one team wins the Super Bowl every year, and everyone else will always see some level of disappointment. But this year was filled with a lot of rug pulls, and the Packers rarely end their season getting blown out. They’ve made a habit of having a game in the palm of their hand and just giving it away. At some point, this isn’t just statistical noise anymore.",

    "fullText": "Ole Miss transfer offensive lineman Devin Harper is committing to LSU via the NCAA transfer portal, On3 has learned. Harper spent just one season in Oxford after being a highly sought-after recruit.\n\nOnce upon a time, Harper was committed to the in-state Tigers. Brian Kelly was still the head coach at the time, opting to play in Lane Kiffin‘s program instead. Of course, coaching changes have since taken place, and Kiffin now resides in Baton Rouge. Hence, the decision to transfer.\n\nHarper played in a handful of games as a true freshman, mostly as a reserve. Results were considered positive, getting a glowing review from the coaching staff during fall camp.\n\n“Devin has relentless effort,” former Ole Miss offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. said via On3 | Rivals’ The Ole Miss Spirit. “For a true freshman, he plays extremely hard. He’s extremely talented. Very athletic. So, those are the things that, number one, stand out.\n\n“He’s got to continue to work on the playbook, his strength, all the other traits that come with time. But this is probably the most talented true freshman lineman, I think, we’ve seen here since I’ve been here with a guy that’s got a very elite skillset and the right mindset, tenacity, that you want for that position to play early.”\n\nOle Miss did plan on having him return for the 2026 season, announcing as such just six days ago. But a change of direction appears to have taken place. Three years of eligibility are expected to remain for Harper at LSU.\n\nHarper played high school football at Shreveport (LA) Calvary Baptist Academy, where he was a four-star prospect. He was the No. 84 overall recruit in the 2025 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.\n\nRivals saw a comparison between Harper and former Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Dion Dawkins. “Length and physicality” were the main traits to two share. Dawkins was a second-round pick back in the 2017 NFL Draft, currently on a run of five consecutive Pro Bowls while protecting quarterback Josh Allen.\n\nThe 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days, spanning from Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA decided. While players have just over two weeks  to enter the portal, they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter.

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Timberwolves will be without their best player tonight, but they still have a chance to push the Houston Rockets toward the Play-In Tournament.\n\nThat would mark a steep fall for a team that entered the season with legitimate title aspirations following the arrival of Kevin Durant.\n\nMy Timberwolves vs. Rockets predictions recognize the immediate Minnesota value in Anthony Edwards’ absence.\n\nRead \n\nTimberwolves vs Rockets best bet: Jaden McDaniels Over 16.5 points (-105)\n\nJaden McDaniels scored 14 points in Tuesday’s first quarter at Milwaukee, which is the reason he cashed this same prop by only half a point, adding a second-quarter 3-pointer. The Minnesota Timberwolves were so walloping the Bucks that McDaniels eased up.\n\nHe has now cleared this prop in six of eight games without Anthony Edwards in the lineup this season, averaging 19.9 points in those eight games, up from 13.5 points in 31 games alongside the Minnesota superstar.\n\nMcDaniels takes 10.1 shots per game with Edwards in the lineup, jumping to 13.75 without the MVP candidate. Maybe even more notable, McDaniels’s field-goal percentage rises to 55.5% in that increased usage, up from 51.0%.\n\nThe 25-year-old is a more complete player than given credit for, and that often shows up when the Timberwolves’ best offensive player is on the bench.\n\nDoubt Houston Rockets guard Reed Sheppard in all defensive matchups. He logged 19 minutes last night and finished a team-worst minus-10.\n\nYes, it was a 20-point loss to Oklahoma City, but some of that stemmed from Sheppard’s defensive issues. Minnesota point guard Donte DiVincenzo shouldn’t need much space to score in this matchup.\n\nThe McDaniels–DiVincenzo pairing has been a key reason the Timberwolves are 5-1 ATS in their last six games without Anthony Edwards, compared to just 13-17 ATS with Edwards since Nov. 1.\n\nAs brilliant as Edwards is, Minnesota often plays with sharper focus in his absence.\n\nJaden McDaniels Over 16.5 points\n\nDonte DiVincenzo Over 14.5 points\n\nPrior to Rudy Gobert’s one-game suspension on Tuesday, he had cleared this prop in six straight games. Minnesota's center may be playing the best basketball of his career.\n\nJaden McDaniels Over 16.5 points\n\nDonte DiVincenzo Over 14.5 points\n\nSpread: Timberwolves +4.5 (-110) | Rockets -4.5 (-110)\n\nMoneyline: Timberwolves +150 | Rockets -180\n\nOver/Under: Over 222 (-110) | Under 222 (-110)\n\nHouston has lost seven straight games against the spread, falling short of bookmakers’ expectations by an average of 13.1 points. That includes four outright losses as a favorite.

    "description": "Jason Logan breaks down his favorite underdog bets of the NFL Divisional Round, including the Denver Broncos.",
    "fullText": "The start of the NFL playoffs saw underdogs bark loudly, with point spread pups finishing 4-2 ATS.\n\nWhat does that mean for this weekend?\n\nOverall, Divisional Round dogs are 21-18-1 ATS going back to the 2015-16 season, but that’s after underdog NFL picks put forth a 4-0 ATS windfall last January.\n\nThe second round of the tournament has traditionally been tougher sledding for teams getting the points — whether you’re getting a single tally or more than a touchdown.\n\nHere are my NFL Underdogs picks and predictions for the Divisional Round.\n\nLast week: 1-1 ATS\nSeason: 32-22-2 ATS (+6.56 units)\n\nBest bet: Denver Broncos +1.5\n(-120 at FanDuel)\n\nThis was one of my first bets of the Divisional Round. Who wouldn’t like a rested No. 1 seed hosting a badly bruised opponent on a short week?\n\nThere are tables in the parking lot of Highmark Stadium in better shape than the Buffalo Bills, as they head up the mountain to face the Denver Broncos on Saturday. Buffalo is down to four healthy WRs, the defense just lost its veteran safety, and QB Josh Allen took a “Hell in a Cell” like beating in the win at Jacksonville.\n\nDenver is an elite defense with two weeks to scheme for Allen & Co. The Broncos’ rushing defense has been iffy toward the end of the year, but given the missing pieces in the Bills' passing game, Vance Joseph can sell out on stopping RB James Cook and force Allen to throw into the teeth of this stop unit.\n\nBuffalo was able to overcome the run being nullified by the Jaguars in the Wild Card Round, with Allen methodically picking apart the Jacksonville zone coverage. However, the Denver secondary is stingier, and its man-centric schemes match up well against a depleted Bills receiving corps.\n\nAllen, overall, has struggled against man coverage. He’s tops in the NFL in many metrics versus zone, but sees his output tempered in terms of completion percentage, passer rating, and catchable ball rate against zone schemes.\n\nBest bet: Chicago Bears +4\n(-114 at BetRivers)\n\nThis spread has slimmed from Los Angeles Rams -4.5 as low as -3.5, with Matthew Stafford’s injured throwing hand fueling that initial adjustment. But you can still find the Chicago Bears +4 on the board, which is a spread that holds more value than you think.\n\nFour has become an under-the-radar key number in NFL betting in recent years, especially since the league moved the PAT further back. From a handicapping standpoint, the 4-point spread has become a “Bermuda Triangle” of betting: favorites win but don’t cover.\n\nGoing back to 2015, when the PAT was moved from the two to the 15-yard line, 4-point favorites win outright 58% of the time but cover in just 45% of those games. In the 29 seasons prior, 4-point chalk won 69% of their games and covered the spread at a 56% rate.\n\nSince 2020, that ATS clip has sunk to 42% despite the win rate remaining unchanged, and closing 4-point favorites are 3-5 SU and 2-6 ATS this season (FYI: Faves between -4 and -4.5 are 4-15 ATS in 2025-26).\n\nNow, I’m not betting the Bears solely on them being 4-point underdogs.\n\nChicago’s explosive passing attack can expose this L.A. secondary, that’s struggled in the home stretch and just made Bryce Young look like Steve Young in the Wild Card Round (for the second time this season).\n\nAnd there’s the matter of the Rams traveling for a second straight week and coming into a cold climate, with extended forecasts calling for bitter temperatures (some models show -7) and potentially 20-plus mph winds at Soldier Field.\n\nIf you like the Rams, you may want to avoid the point spread altogether and choose a moneyline ranging around -200. For the sake of this column, I'll grab Chicago +4 Sunday night.\n\nMy NFL Underdogs column is 32-22-2 ATS this season for ++6.56 units.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "No, nothing is done until it's done. And a deal between the Giants and coach John Harbaugh is not done.\n\nHere's the latest, from Adam Schefter of ESPN.com: \"Giants and John Harbaugh still are working through the details of their contract, and it is not yet done, per sources. The final issues aren’t over money; it’s over language. 'There’s no derailment and nothing has changed,' one source said. Talks continue, and the two sides are working to get it across the finish line.\"\n\n\"Language\" is very, very broad. Unless they're arguing over whether it will be written in English or Spanish, the delay can be about anything other than money.\n\nIt could be control over the roster. Over the draft. It could relate to whether Harbaugh will report to G.M. Joe Schoen, or whether Schoen will report to him. Or whether they'll both report directly to ownership.\n\nIt could be over (as we recently learned) whether Harbaugh can resign and immediately go to work for a new team without compensation to the Giants. Or maybe Harbaugh is taking a stand against the boilerplate requirement that any/all disputes be resolved in the NFL's secret, rigged, kangaroo court of arbitration presided over by the Commissioner.\n\nReally, haggling over language could be about anything. The only thing we know it isn't about it money.\n\nAt some point, they need to get it done. At some point, if one side or the other doesn't bend or offer a win-win compromise, an impasse will arise.\n\nEither way, Harbaugh has the leverage. The cat is out of the bag. If the Giants don't seal the deal, they'll be perceived as losers. So, if Harbaugh holds the line on whatever the issue is (or issues are), the Giants have no choice but to blink.",

    "description": "Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang thinks privileged Gen Z grads should lower their expectations if they want success.",
    "fullText": "Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs.\n\nWe are often told that setting the bar high is key to success. After all, if you shoot for the moon and miss, at least you’ll land with the stars. But Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang wants privileged Gen Z grads to lower their expectations.\n\n“People with very high expectations have very low resilience—and unfortunately, resilience matters in success,” Huang said during an interview with the Stanford Graduate School of Business. “One of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations.”\n\nIndeed, as the billionaire boss pointed out, those at elite institutions like Stanford probably have higher expectations for their future than your average Joe.\n\nThe university is one of the most selective in the United States—it ranks third best in the country, according to the QS World University Rankings, and the few students who get picked to study there are charged more than $68,000 in tuition fees for the premium, compared to the average $38,270 per annum cost.\n\nBut, unfortunately for those saddled with student debt, not even the best universities in the world can teach you resilience.\n\n“I don’t know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you,” Huang added.\n\nHuang’s advice for America’s next-gen elite comes from a place of experience: His life now is a world away from his childhood, which was, by his own admission, steeped in adversity.\n\nThe tech genius—who with a net worth of $155 billion is one of the world’s wealthiest people—was born in Taiwan in 1963 and spent the bulk of his early life in Thailand, before moving to the U.S. at 9 years old.\n\nHis serendipitous Stateside move came after his dad, who worked for an air conditioner manufacturer, did some training in the country and set his sights on the American Dream.\n\n“I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful on the one hand,” he said. “But there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering.”\n\nOne example of Huang’s hardship was his daily high school experience: The teenager had to cross a dangerous footbridge with missing planks over a river to get to his public school in Kentucky, where he was then relentlessly tormented.\n\n“The way you described Chinese people back then was ‘Ch-nks,’ ” Huang previously told the New Yorker, adding that bullies even tried to toss him off the bridge.\n\nIn the Stanford interview, he also credited his success and work ethic with his first job at Denny’s, where he was the “best dishwasher” before getting promoted to busboy and giving that his “best” also.\n\n“I never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,” Huang added. “Anyways, eventually I became a CEO. I’m still working on being a good CEO.”\n\nCoincidentally, it was at Denny’s where he cooked up the idea for a company that specialized in computer chips to render graphics, over a Super Bird sandwich with his friends Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. The trio went on to cofound Nvidia, and the rest is history.\n\nFor those fortunate enough to never have personally experienced hardship growing up, Huang doesn’t have any advice on how to welcome more of it into your life now. But he did have some advice on embracing tough times.\n\n“I don’t know how to do it [but] for all of you Stanford students, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering,” Huang said. “Greatness comes from character and character isn’t formed out of smart people—it’s formed out of people who suffered.”\n\nIt’s why despite Nvidia’s success—the company has a $2 trillion market cap—Huang would still welcome hardship at his organization.\n\n“To this day I use the phrase ‘pain and suffering’ inside our company with great glee,” he added. “I mean that in a happy way because you want to refine the character of your company.”\n\nEssentially, if you want your workforce to always be on their A game, don’t let them rest on their laurels.\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on March 13, 2024.",

    "description": "I left the Marines to become an entrepreneur. While the skills I learned in the military helped my transition, I struggled with civilian work life.",
    "fullText": "When I left the Marines, it was not because I disliked the work. I had originally planned to serve 20 years and retire in uniform, but over time, new interests began pulling me in different directions.\n\nThe Marines are a 24-hour responsibility. Once you commit, your personal ambitions take a backseat. Eventually, I reached a point where I wanted to explore those ambitions — specifically, entrepreneurship — while I was still young enough to act on them.\n\nI made the decision to leave the service during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — even though the civilian job market felt uncertain, and many encouraged me to stay.\n\nBut retired service members who had built businesses offered a different message. They helped me realize that the military equips people with more transferable skills than they often think. The transition resources on base reinforced that point, so I felt ready to move on.\n\nIn the Marines, I worked on amphibious operations and rotated through several roles. That variety helped me grow, but it also made choosing a civilian path harder.\n\nI had multiple strengths and enjoyed different aspects of my job, which meant I didn't leave with a single, defined plan. I had possibilities, but no fixed route.\n\nOnce I committed to transitioning, I wrote my goals down and worked toward them before my end date. Even with that preparation, the hardest part was simply starting. In the military, the steps are usually provided. In civilian life, you take every step on your own.\n\nI started to feel directionless, taking jobs in truck driving, sales, and real estate.\n\nI didn't realize how prepared I was until I stepped into civilian life. Public speaking, counseling skills, emotional discipline, and the habit of double-checking paperwork all became essential. Writing things down remained one of my strongest habits.\n\nThose small details sharpened my mind and made me more reliable. Clear communication and consistent structure helped me as I moved toward consulting and supporting clients.\n\nMy experience also helped me advance at key moments. One employer took a chance on me specifically because I had served in the military. Veterans continued to mentor me even when they could not offer opportunities. When I started consulting, I leaned heavily on my military experience, especially in developing structure and communication systems for clients.\n\nWorking multiple military jobs gave me broad experience, but entrepreneurship requires long-term focus. If you jump between strengths too quickly, you never grow one fully. I had to learn to slow myself down and commit to the task.\n\nThe cultural difference between military and civilian workplaces was larger than I expected. In the Marines, keeping everyone informed is a core rule. In civilian environments, information moves at different speeds. People communicate based on their roles, goals, or personal habits. Especially in smaller workplaces, communication can be inconsistent. I had to learn not to take those gaps personally.\n\nAccountability also functions differently. In the Marines, you trust that everyone is committed to the same mission. In civilian workplaces, people have different motivations. Some individuals seek career advancement, others desire stability, and others simply need a steady income. I struggled to adapt to that.\n\nThe military provided me with leadership experience, diverse skills, and a foundation that I still rely on. But I wish there had been stronger bridges between the military and civilian companies. Transitioning often felt like a jump when it should've felt like a path forward.\n\nLeaving the Marines did not mean starting over. It meant learning how to translate discipline, structure, and communication into a world that operates in a different way.\n\nThe biggest lesson was understanding that you cannot transition alone. You need civilians who can explain the environment you are entering and veterans who can share how they adapted.\n\nMy transition taught me that the qualities that made me effective in uniform still matter, but they must be applied with flexibility and adaptability. Civilian strategy requires patience, influence, effective communication, and a willingness to take the initiative and build your own steps.\n\nThe challenge is real, but so is the opportunity to rebuild with purpose.",

    "fullText": "How confident are you in AI? Enough to bet your retirement on it?\n\nThat's become a debate thanks to a bold proclamation by Elon Musk: Saving for retirement in 10 or 20 years \"won't matter.\"\n\nMusk's confidence comes from the work he's doing in artificial intelligence. The technological advancements will create an \"abundance\" of resources, granting everyone a \"universal high income,\" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO said.\n\nThat's easy to say when you have checks notes and almost passes out nearly $700 billion in the bank. What about people whose net worths have a lot fewer zeros?\n\nA group of BI reporters reached out to seven personal finance and AI gurus to get their take. They all agreed you shouldn't stop those direct deposits into your 401(K).\n\nEven if AI increases productivity and reduces costs over time, it's not clear whether the benefits will be distributed evenly across the population.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans are already in a precarious position regarding their retirement. Last year, BI's Noah Sheidlower spoke to nearly 200 Americans who continue to work past the age of 80 as part of our \"80 over 80\" series.\n\nWhile some like the fact that they can still work, others don't have a choice. And that's with the benefit of Social Security, a safety net that might not exist in the future.\n\nYou can't completely discredit Musk's take, though.\n\nYes, forgoing retirement on the belief that AI and tech will just figure it out in a few decades is a massive gamble. But the past few years have reminded us that tech can quickly flip the script on conventional wisdom.\n\nFive years ago, a career as a computer programmer felt secure. Now … not so much.\n\nIt's not a new phenomenon. My colleague Alistair Barr recently wrote in his Tech Memo newsletter () that the US quickly went from having 25 million horses to fewer than two million thanks to the arrival of the steam engine.\n\nEven if Musk is right, you'll probably still want some extra pocket change. Money isn't just about being able to buy things. It's also about access and exclusivity, and it's not clear how that might work in this new utopia.\n\nIt's not just going to Disney World; it's being able to cut the lines. It's not just getting tickets to the game; it's sitting courtside.\n\nBut if everyone's got \"universal high income,\" how will those perks work? Will all of us be equal? Or maybe some of us will be more equal than others?",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jennifer Clinchy, owner of Clinchy Career Consulting. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was a White House attorney for nine years, spanning three different presidents (Obama, Trump, and Biden). Six years ago, I started working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but I still get teary-eyed when I think about my time in the White House. As the daughter of immigrants, I never dreamed I'd be reporting to work on Pennsylvania Avenue each day.\n\nI loved that some of the brightest people in the country were my colleagues. I hold a dual degree in law and policy, and one of my responsibilities at the White House was to prepare presidential appointees for their Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nIn that role, I reviewed hundreds of résumés and cover letters. I helped people stand out in what's essentially a very high-stakes job interview. Working with these incredible candidates who applied for powerful and influential positions led me down an unexpected career path: résumé writing.\n\nMy parents raised me to be self-sufficient. They were both hardworking. My dad taught me that education is particularly valuable because it can never be taken away from you; No matter what happens, you'll always have your education.\n\nI attended law school in Washington, D.C., where the federal government is omnipresent. I was drawn to federal jobs not only because of the perceived security, but because I felt they mattered. With this work, I could help people, defend justice, and protect the environment. After about 14 years as a federal attorney, my salary is about $186,000.\n\nI'd been reviewing résumés for friends, colleagues, and mentees for years. Then, in early 2020, one of my friends said, \"You're really good at this. Have you ever considered it as a career path?\"\n\nHis question made me realize I had this latent talent that I'd never really considered harnessing. Soon after, the pandemic hit. I was used to traveling about twice a month for work, and when that stopped, I had time to spare.\n\nI signed up for Fiverr and started writing résumés. Initially, I set my prices low, but I soon realized I wanted to emphasize quality over quantity. Today, I charge $2,000 for a résumé and cover letter. I spend many hours reviewing each client's history and experience to determine the best way to present them in the most favorable light.\n\nOver the past five years, I've earned more than $260,000 on Fiverr. I also work directly with clients, so my average annual income from résumés over those years has been about $70,000.\n\nI now live in Seattle, where the cost of homes is very high. I worried I wouldn't be able to afford a home on just my federal salary alone. The résumé business has enabled me to purchase a historic home and complete the costly renovations it requires, including new flooring, a new roof, and an earthquake-resistant system.\n\nEssentially, the bulk of my résumé income goes toward maintenance and repairs on my home. My federal job pays the mortgage and other essentials.\n\nDuring the recent federal shutdown, I was furloughed, and résumé writing became especially important. I generated about $18,000 in résumé writing over those six weeks.\n\nAs an attorney, I work roughly 9-to-5. When I get home, I spend about two to three hours most week nights writing résumés. On weekends, I work on résumés for anywhere from five to 20 hours, depending on my workload.\n\nIf that sounds exhausting, it's because it is. I don't have much free time, but I'm making a conscious choice to spend it this way. I prioritize sleep and exercise, especially as I age.\n\nThe money from résumé writing is wonderful, but what really keeps me engaged are the clients. I worked with a food scientist who held a patent on a famous potato chip, and the vice president of a record label who worked with artists I hear on the radio. My most meaningful job was helping a person living in a domestic violence shelter get a job for the first time, which helped her secure a better future for her family. There's no way to put the value of that into words or dollars.",

    "title": "HBO's new 'Game of Thrones' spinoff 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' ditches dragons for heart — and it works",
    "description": "\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" is a \"Game of Thrones\" spinoff with lower stakes and more soul. That's a good thing.",
    "fullText": "Day-one \"Game of Thrones\" fans who are itching to relive their early memories of Westeros would be wise to tune in Sunday, when \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" premieres on HBO.\n\nThe new spinoff series is a welcome return to the grounded storytelling and lively characters that initially set \"Game of Thrones\" apart from other fantasy shows — before the budget ballooned, the source material ran dry, and CGI spectacles became a key selling point.\n\nBased on the first novella in George R. R. Martin's \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" series and set about 70 years after the events of \"Game of Thrones\" prequel \"House of the Dragon,\" \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" is firmly focused on the travails of an everyman: Dunk, aka Ser Duncan the Tall (Peter Claffey), a low-born orphan with no riches, no status, and no lord to pledge allegiance to. He's an ordinary guy trying to make his way in the world — a medieval, oft-ruthless world at that — forging his path using little more than instinct.\n\nThe series' deliberately narrow perspective lends itself to lower stakes and more comedy, making it a refreshing departure from both \"Game of Thrones\" and \"House of the Dragon.\" With just six episodes all under 45 minutes, no epic dragon battles or undead armies of White Walkers, and about a quarter of the budget, showrunner Ira Parker described \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" to Business Insider as \"'Game of Thrones' without all the stuff.\"\n\n\"We are certainly very character-driven because we have nothing else,\" Parker said.\n\nUltimately, that ends up being a good thing. Shifting the perspective away from the mega-battles, magical creatures, and machinations of the Westerosi elite allows Parker to tell a grounded story that offers a different view of the sprawling world Martin created.\n\n\"The only promise I made to George was that we would never be in the POV of the lords and ladies, kings and queens, the upper echelon,\" Parker said, referring to Martin, who served as an executive producer on the show and called it \"as faithful as adaptation as a reasonable man could hope for\" on his blog.\n\nInstead, his protagonist's strength is his ordinariness.\n\n\"We see Dunk having the same sort of issues that we might have in our daily life, which is trying to figure out what's next,\" Parker said. \"He finds himself all alone out in the middle of nowhere, and he just sets a direction because that's what people do. They put one foot in front of the other, and they see where it takes them. And that's really Dunk's only superpower.\"\n\nDunk is far from the most talented fighter or the smartest strategist — at the start of the series, he doesn't even have a squire. As a hedge knight, he's more of a roaming mercenary than a trained hero. But despite the lower stakes and compressed scope of his tale, Dunk is not unfamiliar. His dogged loyalty, compassion for strangers, and steady moral compass are reminiscent of fan-favorite figures from \"Game of Thrones,\" particularly season one's Ned Stark, a character synonymous with integrity.\n\nBut while Ned met an untimely end in one of the most iconic and tragic twists in TV history, Dunk's endearing qualities shine through far more outside the cutthroat world of King's Landing. In the rural town of Ashford Meadow, Dunk's good heart doesn't feel so gravely out of place.\n\n\"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" explores themes of honor and duty, what they mean, and what they cost — especially for someone with no family or wealth to fall back on. The fate of the world may not be at stake, but Dunk's life often is, and the show quickly succeeds in making him someone to root for.\n\n\"The reason I decided to come on board with this was because of Dunk. I want to say I relate to this character, but the truth is, everyone will relate to this character,\" Parker said. \"That feeling of impostor syndrome, the feeling of wanting something better for yourself… he's an easy guy to like.\"\n\nThis characterization is particularly effective in Claffey's scenes with his young costar, Dexter Sol Ansell, who plays Egg, a scrappy, conspicuously bald stable boy who soon becomes his squire.\n\nWhen the pair meet en route to Ashford, Egg offers to join Dunk on his travels, telling his soon-to-be mentor, \"Every knight needs a squire, and you look like you need one more than most.\"\n\nThe sharp, sometimes brazen character is a fitting foil to Dunk, whose optimism can sometimes come across as naivete. The pair soon grow as fond of each other as they are exasperated — a time-honored dynamic in the \"Game of Thrones\" universe, where scenes between duos like the Hound and Arya and Brienne and Podrick provided levity, emotion, and crucial character depth. Grisly violence and gratuitous nudity notwithstanding, this is the stuff that breathes bittersweet life into the story and makes Westeros worth revisiting.\n\nApparently, HBO executives thought so too. \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" season two is already in production, scheduled for a 2027 release. The next batch of episodes will adapt \"The Sworn Sword,\" the second Dunk and Egg novella published in 2003.\n\nParker said he was eager to get back to filming, and not just because Ansell is a \"ticking time bomb of cuteness.\" He hopes the series will give him the chance to chart Egg's coming-of-age story, to confront the tenderness and brutality of growing up that are universal whether you're in Westeros or the real world.\n\n\"At what point does the person start becoming responsible for who they are, rather than a function of the environment that they were brought up in?\" Parker hinted, wondering aloud. \"It feels like we're finding Egg just right at that turning point.\"",

    "title": "I just found out my boyfriend has $100,000 in debt. I want to marry him, not his debt — what should I do?",
    "description": "\"For Love & Money\" answers your relationship and money questions. This week, a reader wonders what to do about their boyfriend's $100,000 debt.",
    "fullText": "I started dating someone six months ago. It's been fast, but we're both in our 30s, and I believe that when you know, you know. We plan to move in together this fall, and I'm excited; not only will I be able to hang out with my best friend around the clock, but we've also agreed that after this, the next step is an engagement and marriage.\n\nThen, a few days ago, we were having a conversation about all the important things couples should be on the same page about, when my boyfriend confessed that he has over $100,000 in debt.\n\nI don't know what to do. I've been financially responsible my entire adult life, and while I don't want to see debt as a dealbreaker, and I wouldn't break up with him over it, a part of me wants nothing to do with his debt. Also, I worry about what this says about his financial habits. I still want to marry him, though. What do I do?\n\nWe all love the honeymoon phase of a new relationship, with the endless fresh inside jokes, best behavior, and butterflies. Few things zap the glow as quickly as hard conversations about debt. Talking about money is difficult and awkward, which is why so many people avoid doing so for as long as possible, even after marriage.\n\nIn this regard, you're ahead of many couples — bravo! The way the two of you chose to have this conversation despite its potential to ruin everything tells me you both have integrity and common sense. You've done your due diligence, but due diligence doesn't stop with the research phase. Now that you have this information, you must decide how to address it.\n\nIn my eyes, there are three ways you can respond to your boyfriend's debt.\n\nFirst, you can break up. If debt is a dealbreaker for you, it just is, and that's OK.\n\nBased on your letter, it sounds like that's not an option you'd like to choose, though. Your emphasis on marriage is understandable; you're in your 30s, you've likely watched most of your friends get married, and you may feel it's time to tick the marriage box yourself. When an amazing man walks into your life who loves you and is on the same page as you about marriage, you may feel the box is as good as ticked. Dumping him now could feel like starting back at zero; understandably, you aren't eager to do that.\n\nBut waiting for the right person is more important than finding someone and forcing the relationship to work. This doesn't mean your boyfriend isn't the right person or that you can't marry him down the road. But the goal of your relationship right now shouldn't be marriage; it should be making sure you know what you're getting into.\n\nAnd I want to stress that while $100,000 in debt is a significant and scary number, it's not necessarily irresponsible to marry someone who has it. It would be irresponsible, though, to learn this information, file it away as inconvenient, and continue toward marriage, assuming it will all work out. Based on what you said about wanting \"nothing to do with his debt\" and worrying what it means about his financial habits, though, that's not you. In other words, you know a red flag when you see one. And while a red flag means to stop, it doesn't necessarily mean giving up altogether.\n\nWhich brings us to your second option: Rather than sprinting down the aisle, you slow things down and give yourself time to get a stronger read on the situation.\n\nIn this case, I think the red flag you've spotted is signaling you to take a beat. You've only been with this man for six months — you've experienced less than half of the major holidays with him. If you're right and he's the one, you have a lifetime together ahead of you. What's another year or two spent getting to know each other, getting his finances in order, and paying attention to his spending habits to make sure you want to share a bank account with him someday?\n\nDuring that time, ask your boyfriend to walk you through his plan to pay down debt and maintain an open dialogue with you on his progress. On that same note, establish regular conversations about money management with one another. This could look like sharing tips and tricks while actively setting a financial strategy in motion that will eventually allow you to combine finances and build a life together. It will also help you cultivate a healthy rapport and routine around money.\n\nOr finally, you can stick to the plan: Move in together and get married soon after. My sister was with her now-husband only nine months before getting married, and 14 years later, they are one of the happiest couples I know.\n\nBut if you do this, I think you need to include set conditions for your boyfriend and future husband. We talk a lot about unconditional love — love that doesn't know the word \"dealbreaker,\" love that doesn't stumble in the face of pain and disappointment, love that has all the information and remains loyal. Sometimes, we even go so far as to say that love with conditions isn't even love at all.\n\nI disagree. Yes, a parent's love for their child should be unconditional, but your love for a man you started dating six months ago? There ought to be a few conditions, including that your boyfriend makes a plan to pay off his debt and demonstrates his ability to follow through on it before you tie the knot. This should include proving his financial competence by not actively accruing more debt. Keeping your finances separate for a while, even as you combine the rest of your lives, may also offer you peace of mind.\n\nWhatever path you choose, remember there's nothing wrong with having doubts and expectations. Nor is there anything wrong with wanting to stay with the man you love, even one who isn't great with money. Sometimes it's hard to know if you should listen to your head or follow your heart, but you'll rarely go wrong by remaining honest with yourself about what you need.\n\nThis article was originally published in October 2023.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

    "description": "According to an etiquette expert, diners at high-end restaurants should never show up late, disregard the waitstaff, or forget to leave a tip.",
    "fullText": "Going out to a high-end restaurant can be a luxurious experience. But for patrons who are used to more casual dining experiences, eating at a fancy restaurant can be stressful.\n\nTo learn more about everything from how to dress to how to interact with the waitstaff, Business Insider asked Elaine Swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert, to identify four common mistakes diners should avoid making at high-end restaurants. Here's what she said.\n\nWhen dining at a high-end restaurant, patrons should expect to receive a higher level of service. Therefore, Swann said it's important to build rapport with the waitstaff.\n\n\"I've heard people say, 'Don't interact with waitstaff,' and that's incorrect, and I think that's quite snobbish,\" Swann said.\n\n\"Instead, you should communicate effectively with the staff; find out their name,\" she told BI.\n\nShe also suggested calling the server by name when making specific requests or asking questions about the menu, which can help set the tone for an enjoyable dining experience.\n\nSwann said another common mistake diners make is not dressing appropriately for the occasion.\n\nTo avoid this faux pas, she recommends finding out the dress code in advance to ensure you're wearing the proper attire.\n\n\"You can check the website or call ahead,\" she told BI. \"And then another thing that I encourage people to do is look up photos.\"\n\nSwann said looking up the restaurant's social media pages can also give diners an idea of what appropriate attire may look like. She added that it can help to look at the restaurant's hashtags to see what other people who have dined there have worn.\n\nSwann said another mistake guests tend to make at high-end restaurants is showing up \"fashionably late.\" She said showing up on time helps ensure the service goes as planned.\n\n\"The service at the high-end restaurant is based upon everyone being there at the same time, on time,\" she said.\n\nSwann said being late can impede the flow of the service.\n\n\"It's important to respect people's time. When someone gives you a time to show up, they're expecting to start within the flow they have designed,\" she told BI. \"And It's quite disrespectful to show up late.\"\n\n\"You should always leave a tip at every restaurant you dine at, regardless of if it's high-end or your standard mom-and-pop restaurant,\" Swann said.\n\nShe added that although 20% of the bill is the standard tip at a regular restaurant, the tip at a high-end restaurant should be a minimum of 20%.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 9, 2024, and most recently updated on January 16, 2026.",

    "fullText": "This story is based on an interview with Jean-Philippe Rio-Py (known professionally as RIOPY), 42, a British/French musician who has composed music for meditation apps and the trailers for award-winning films, including \"The Danish Girl \"and \"The Shape of Water.\" The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up in France, inside a cult that my mother joined in her early 20s, not long after I was born.\n\nIt was a torturous environment with dogma and indoctrination. You got beaten up to \"take the evil\" out of you.\n\nThere were times when I was forced to sit in a chair and not move a muscle for an entire day. Our heads were shaved. The cult was led by a guru who literally had a throne. At one point, my family and I lived in the tower of a moldy old castle.\n\nI wasn't allowed to watch TV, read, or listen to music. The one thing I turned to for escapism was a piano. I taught myself to play from an early age.\n\nI remember the vibration. I always say it was like a drop of water splashing everywhere, filling my heart with love. I'd play one note and discover a whole melody.\n\nThe piano was sold, almost as a punishment. After my younger brother was given a guitar, I'd sneak it out to play in the middle of the night.\n\nI had a dental appointment on my 18th birthday in 2001, and the dentist said my body showed signs of extreme stress. It was frightening. So much so that I decided to leave that very day.\n\nI moved to Los Angeles right after graduating from high school, where I cleaned toilets in exchange for a bed in a shared hostel. I was homeless. It was an aimless existence.\n\nBut I didn't stay in the US for long. In 2003, at 20, I moved to Paris, where I began playing the piano in bars and clubs. I also tried to get gigs in restaurants and hotels. Music was the only way I found peace.\n\nI moved to the UK within a year and worked in a music shop. I battled with my mental health, sinking into a deep depression.\n\nA concerned customer asked me about my life and took me under his wing. He was an academic and helped me get a music scholarship at Oxford Brookes University, where I met my now-wife, Sabra.\n\nI began performing in pubs and concert rooms. At one point, they included the Royal Opera House in London. Serendipitously, in 2011, I played at a Vanity Fair party attended by Chris Martin from Coldplay.\n\nHe said that he loved my music. He asked me to sit at his table and talk, but I was too shy a person. Not put off, he walked across the room and gave me a big hug.\n\nHe asked my manager if he could help me in any way. My manager made a joke and said, \"Well, he could do with a piano.\" So he bought me a Boston piano, designed by Steinway & Sons.\n\nI still had no money and had nowhere to put it. One night, Chris invited me to his gig and spoke to me at the after-party. \"How's the piano?\" he asked. \"It's amazing,\" I replied. I was too embarrassed to tell him that it was still in storage, where it stayed for two years.\n\nThankfully, my creative and commercial work took off over the following six years, during which I traveled the world.\n\nI had a series of meetings with record labels, and was thrilled to be signed by Warner Classics in 2017. I recorded my first album on Chris's piano, and it was released the following year. I now have four albums under my belt. The fifth album, \"Be Love\", is scheduled for release on January 16, 2026.\n\nI enjoyed composing for film trailers and commercials. I have made music for meditation apps. My experience as a child and mental health struggles have made me want to bring others peace.\n\nWhen people often ask me what I'm most proud of, it's being a husband and a father of three. Music has helped heal my trauma, but my family is everything to me.",

    "description": "I'd been on the hunt for an easy, high-protein, plant-based lunch. Martha Stewart's crispy fried tofu has become my new go-to, flavorful recipe.",
    "fullText": "Traumatizing: that's the word I'd use to describe my first experience with tofu.\n\nThe first time I tried cooking tofu at home, it was completely flavorless, and worse yet, the texture reminded me of a soggy marshmallow.\n\nIt was almost enough to make me swear off tofu completely, but I've been on the hunt for high-protein, plant-based recipes, so I thought I'd bravely give it another go with Martha Stewart's crispy fried tofu.\n\nStewart says that her recipe is not only a cinch to make, but also yields super-crunchy tofu. After trying it myself, I agree.\n\nNot only was this tofu delicious, but it filled me up for several hours.\n\nExtra-firm tofu in particular, which this recipe calls for, contains about 14 grams of protein per 3-ounce serving, although this can depend on the brand and product you buy.\n\nConveniently, I already had most of the required ingredients for this recipe in my pantry and fridge.\n\nAside from extra-firm tofu, the recipe calls for a neutral cooking oil (like safflower), salt, and cornstarch.\n\nStewart also recommends grabbing mayonnaise and Sriracha for a dipping sauce, as well as chopped scallions and lime wedges for serving.\n\nAlthough draining liquid out of tofu may take a little extra time, trust me when I say it's worth it — because excess moisture will prevent your tofu from crisping up.\n\nStewart recommends lining a baking sheet with multiple layers of paper towels, arranging the sliced tofu on top, and then layering more paper towels on top of the tofu before weighing it down with another baking sheet topped with some heavy cans.\n\nThen, wait 30 minutes for the liquid to drain onto the paper towels.\n\nStewart suggests slicing the tofu lengthwise into long strips, but I prefer to cut mine into cubes — I find that smaller pieces yield crispier edges.\n\nAfter draining the tofu, coating it in cornstarch is key: When I first tried a fried-tofu recipe, I didn't follow this step, and it didn't crisp up nearly as well.\n\nStewart suggests mixing any of your preferred spices into the cornstarch prior to dredging, so I added garlic powder, sea salt, and sesame seeds. Other options mentioned in the recipe include Cajun seasoning, onion powder, and ground cumin.\n\nTo coat it, pour the cornstarch and spices into a large bowl or container, then add the tofu. Once everything's in the bowl, either toss it with your hands or pop on a lid and shake it all up until all the sides are coated.\n\nHeat up your oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium.\n\nStewart's favorite oil for this recipe is safflower, since it has a high smoke point and neutral flavor — but canola oil, sunflower oil, vegetable oil, and peanut oil also work. I used organic canola oil because it's what I had on hand.\n\nIf the tofu is too crowded in the pan, it won't get evenly crunchy on the outside — so, Stewart says it's best to split the tofu into two batches.\n\nFry each batch until the exterior of the tofu has just turned golden brown, turning every minute or two to ensure all sides make contact with the oil.\n\nThis should take five minutes, according to Stewart, but it took me closer to seven — perhaps because I like mine extra crunchy.\n\nOnce the tofu is done cooking, transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels to soak up any excess oil.\n\nThis is when Stewart recommends seasoning the tofu with salt, but because I already added salt to the cornstarch coating, I skipped that step.\n\nStewart's favorite dipping sauce for this tofu is a mixture of mayo and Sriracha. I'm not a huge mayo fan, so I used a spicy tahini for a similar but nuttier vibe.\n\nI did, however, follow her tips to garnish with scallions for a pleasantly peppery bite.\n\nMiraculously, this recipe completely transformed my feelings about tofu.\n\nI was amazed by the satisfying, crunchy texture and the sheer amount of flavor it held when seasoned well and served with the right sauce.\n\nBest of all, this tofu is super versatile. Since falling in love with this recipe, I've started adding it to grain bowls with veggies for a super-satiating lunch or dinner.\n\nMy favorite combo is quinoa or white rice with roasted or sauteed Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and broccoli. Sometimes I'll toss in some avocado for creamy texture and healthy fats, or take a cue from Stewart and add a squeeze of lime.\n\nI also believe this tofu would be a tasty addition to a Caesar salad, lettuce wrap, or taco with black beans and avocado.",

    "description": "My partner and I spent 10 days in Japan seeing spots like Kyoto and Tokyo. Planning mistakes, like visiting in September, made our trip worse.",
    "fullText": "When my boyfriend and I planned a 10-day trip to Japan, we had no idea what to expect.\n\nAlthough we've traveled around the world together, it was our first time visiting the country. Upon landing, everything felt completely foreign — it was evident I was far from home.\n\nFortunately, we found Japan to be fun and easy to navigate as foreigners. With translation apps and a little bit of research, the majority of our trip went by without a hitch.\n\nEven still, we made a few mistakes that put a damper on our vacation. Here are a few things we'd do differently to make our next trip even better if we go back to Japan.\n\nThough this isn't the most crowded time to visit the country, the weather was far from ideal.\n\nMost days, the temperature hovered around 93 degrees Fahrenheit which, combined with 98% humidity and no breeze, left us miserable in the oppressive heat.\n\nWeather is hard to predict, but I wish we'd booked our trip just a month or two later. After all, October and November tend to be cooler in Japan.\n\nThe heat took away from our enjoyment of Japan's sites, whether the astonishing Osaka Castle or Tokyo's Sensō-ji Buddhist Temple.\n\nThe best thing we did was book accommodation with laundry services. We sweat through at least two outfits a day, so having easy access to laundry was a lifesaver.\n\nThere's little space for non-essentials in Japan's densely populated cities — especially bulky luggage.\n\nMy boyfriend and I each traveled with a large suitcase, but this was inconvenient. Not only is there limited bag space on the trains, but also doors open and close quickly. If you don't get all your luggage on board in time, you and your bags will be left on the platform.\n\nNext time, we'd use one of Japan's luggage delivery services. For a nominal fee, these services deliver your bags to and from the airport and from hotel to hotel throughout the country.\n\nWe didn't know about this service before our trip, but it would've made a huge difference on travel days.\n\nWhen I travel, I'm far from a planner — on most trips, I do very little research in advance. Sometimes, I don't even know where I'm sleeping the following evening when I wake up in the morning.\n\nShortly after arriving in Japan, however, we quickly realized we should've done more planning before boarding our flights.\n\nJapanese cities like Tokyo felt overwhelming in a way I've never experienced elsewhere. The sheer number of people, restaurants, skyscrapers, and things to do was mind-boggling.\n\nWe were struck with choice overload around every corner. As a result, we missed out on several experiences due to poor planning.\n\nI would've loved visiting Kinkaku-ji Temple in Kyoto — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — but I didn't learn about it until my last evening in the city.\n\nLikewise, watching a Sumo tournament in Osaka would have been fascinating, but our short stay didn't offer enough time to attend.\n\nIf we return to Japan, I'd like to to come equipped with a list of a few must-visit stops and experiences we'd like to check off.",

Roughly 10% to 15% of Reality Labs' 15,000 employees are expected to be laid off, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe metaverse has been a costly bet for Meta, racking up more than $70 billion in losses since 2020. It has faced repeated rounds of cuts as Meta shifts its attention — and spending — toward AI.\n\nIn a memo obtained by Business Insider last year, Meta's CTO, who oversees the company's metaverse efforts, called 2025 \"the most critical\" year of his tenure.\n\nWorkrooms showcased how Meta Horizon could bring people together to work, collaborate, and connect, the company said. But Meta Horizon has since developed into a social platform that supports a wide range of productivity apps and tools.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta said its Horizon managed services will no longer be available for purchase from February 20, although customers would continue to receive support until the start of 2030.",

    "fullText": "The person who named Google's Nano Banana AI image-generation model has a pretty good idea of why the world found it so appealing.\n\n\"One reason we were successful is the model was available everywhere from day one — it didn't matter what country you were in, or whether you were a developer or a consumer, you had it on the same day,\" Product Manager Naina Raisinghani recently told Keyword, Google's official blog. \"And then culturally relevant prompts went viral everywhere, like the popular figurine trend, which started in Thailand, or the saree trend in India.\"\n\nGoogle revealed that Raisinghani was the originator of the model's zany codename, a last-minute decision.\n\n\"So at 2:30 a.m., one of the PMs messaged me saying we needed to submit it, and I said, 'OK, how about something funny like 'Nano Banana'?' And they're like, 'Yeah, sure. That's completely nonsensical,'\" Raisinghani told Keyword.\n\nThe search giant previously had a sweet tooth when it publicly named versions of its Android operating system after a dessert, a tradition it ended in 2019 when it reverted to the less indulgent practice of going with a numeral.\n\nNano Banana isn't the result of a health kick, though. Raisinghani said it is a play on her own nickname, \"Naina Banana.\"\n\n\"Some of my friends call me Naina Banana, and others call me Nano because I'm short and I like computers,\" she said. \"So I just smushed my two nicknames together. And it fit because it was a Flash model.\"\n\nAI frontier model makers and hyperscalers have frequently chosen creative (and sometimes food-centric codenames) for their models during public testing.\n\nLMArena, a popular AI testing platform, allows users to pit two AI models against each other, and they vote for a winner. After the vote, the initially masked model names are revealed. Companies can choose both publicly released models and those still in development, hence the codenames.\n\nGoogle doesn't have any plans to change the model's name.\n\n\"People responded really well,\" Raisinghani said. \"They were so impressed with it, and then they found the name funny, and that kind of grew discourse.\"\n\nRaisinghani also said her team is having fun with the banana wordplay and imagery.\n\n\"We've embraced the banana emoji as one of us. The team is split on the banana puns of it all,\" she said. \"But we're glad people find the model appealing.\"",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Is Gravity Ending?",
    "description": "Do we all need to tether ourselves on August 12?",
    "fullText": "There is a rumor going around online—on Reddit, Facebook, TikTok, and (I assume) Friendster—that gravity will stop working for seven seconds on August 12. Here is part of the warning posted online:\n\nIn November 2024, a secret NASA document titled \"Project Anchor\" leaked online. The project's budget is $89 billion, and its goal is to survive a 7-second gravitational anomaly expected on August 12, 2026, at 14:33 UTC\n\nKey facts:• Duration: 7.3 seconds.• Expected casualties: 40-60 million.\n\nWhat will happen: 1-2 seconds: Everything not secured will rise (people, vehicles, animals).3-4 seconds: Objects will continue to rise to 15-20 meters.5-6 seconds: Panic and chaos will ensue as people hit ceilings.7 seconds: Gravity returns, and everything falls from height.\n\nExpected consequences:• 40 million deaths from falls.• Infrastructure destruction.• Economic collapse lasting over 10 years.• Mass panic.\n\nThis is a shockingly irresponsible prediction filled with misinformation. In a theoretical world where gravity was optional, the death toll would ultimately be much greater, but it would come from earthquakes and tidal waves, not fall damage.\n\nWe'll have to wait until August for observational data about the Great Gravity Switch-Off, but I wanted to be prepared, so I asked Joel Meyers, a theoretical cosmologist and professor at Southern Methodist University, what we can expect on August 12. He said that most of us would survive the initial period of weightlessness without injury, and there's no reason to tie yourself to the sofa. \"It depends on where you are in terms of latitude, but for somebody in, say, New York City, in seven seconds with no gravity, you'd expect to sort of slowly drift upward by about two feet off the surface of the Earth.\"\n\nSo, shockingly, conspiracy theorists on the internet are wrong: you wouldn't \"rise to 15-20 meters;\" you wouldn't even hit your head on the ceiling. You'd just float—unless you leapt into the air at the right moment. \"An average person who could jump about a foot and a half would actually end up jumping about 64 feet in the air without gravity,\" Meyers said.\n\nBefore I spoke to a patient theoretical cosmologist, I was concerned that the lack of gravity inside my body might cause my atoms to detach from one another and I'd dissolve into dust, which I am generally not in favor of. \"Gravity itself doesn't play a role in holding us together,\" Meyers said. \"The structure of our bodies are not gravitational, but electromagnetic.\"\n\nAnother personal gravity fear involves breathing. Since gravity holds the atmosphere to earth, wouldn't all the air be instantly ejected into space instead of staying in my lungs where it belongs? Nope. Decompression would happen, but it would take time. \"The upper layers of the atmosphere would start to float out into space, being pushed away by the layers of atmosphere below them,\" Meyers said, \"But a few seconds wouldn't be long enough for us to lose all of the atmosphere around the Earth.\"\n\nWhen the gravity turns back on, though, it would create a air pressure wave that would disrupt weather patterns in ways we couldn't possibly predict. Worse than that would be the effect of sudden gravity loss on the planet itself. \"This is where things get a little more catastrophic,\" Meyers said. \"In the absence of gravity, there's nothing to fight against that pressure that exists in the core of the Earth or the mantle or the crust. The Earth wouldn't instantaneously explode—it takes time for the mass to move in response to the pressure and to the forces—but there would certainly be a lot of tectonic activity.\"\n\nBut it gets worse. After seven seconds, the Earth would clump back together, which \"would create an impulse that would spread throughout the world in terms of global earthquakes in ways that are really difficult to predict in detail,\" Meyers said.\n\nIf you're going anywhere on August 12, make sure you're not traveling by car. The lack of gravity means your wheels would leave the road, so your ability to steer or brake would be gone. \"You would effectively just be continuing in a straight line at whatever speed you were traveling just before gravity turned off,\" Meyers said, so expect traffic delays on the 405 as every car crashes into every other car, tree, and barrier. Airplanes and submarines would be safe, though, which brings me to my personal plan for August 12.\n\nSince I am not on NASA's list of chosen people, I am going to ride this thing out inside the metal womb of a deep sea submersible. The submersible is a closed system designed to withstand changes in external pressure, negating any atmospheric effect. The turmoil of the ocean rising then falling would likely cause massive tidal waves, but not where I am, under the sea.\n\nWhile the rest of you suckers are dealing with the aftereffects of unimaginable global earthquakes and magma flows, I'll be chilling in my submarine, playing Angry Birds. When the time is right, I'll return triumphantly to the surface to rule over the ruined planet. \"I think that's a very solid plan; [it] really does cover a lot of the bases,\" Meyers said.\n\nI felt dumb doing it, but I asked Meyers point-blank what the chances are that the internet is right about gravity ending on August 12. He said, \"it is very far outside the realm of possibility.\"\n\nThere is no secret NASA document titled \"Project Anchor,\" and there's no way to turn off gravity. \"Gravity is an inherent property of space-time,\" Meyers explained, closing the book on one the year's dumbest conspiracy theories.",

    "description": "Master 90:10 split screen for ultimate mobile productivity.",
    "fullText": "Stock Android added the concept of App Pairs back in Android 15. You choose two apps to use in split screen mode, add a shortcut to the paired apps to the home screen, and it's now trivially easy to trigger split screen multitasking (instead of having to perform multiple tap and drag gestures).\n\nIt sounds neat, but I never really used it, because on my small Pixel 9a, using apps in 50:50 split-screen mode is hardly user-friendly. There's just not enough room on the screen for each app to take up half of it and still be usable. But that changed with Android 16, thanks to a small update to how split screen works.\n\nIn Android 16, the split screen ratios for app pairs are much more flexible. You can have two apps in 70:30, or even 90:10. And once you get used to the idea of 90:10 split screen multitasking, things really start to flow.\n\nFor example, I have an app pair for my Chrome and Gemini apps. Chrome for browsing, and Gemini for research.\n\nChrome is usually my maximized app, taking up 90% of my screen space, while Gemini is docked at the bottom, minimized. But with one tap, Gemini comes to the front and Chrome takes a back seat. And I can keep switching between the two just as easily. This is much faster than using Android's multitasking menu.\n\nTo set up an App Pair and try this out for yourself, you'll first need to create a split screen pair. Open the two apps that you want to pair, and then go to the multitasking view (swipe up from the Home bar and hold for a second). Tap the name of the first app you want to open and choose the Split screen option. Then choose another app to pair it with. You'll now enter a 50:50 split screen view. Grab the handle in between the two apps and drag it all the way up or all the way down to trigger the 90:10 split. Alternatively, you can also set up a 70:30 split by leaving some extra space on your second app.\n\nNow, go back to the multitasking view, tap on one of the app names, and choose the Save app pair option.\n\nAfter that, you'll find the app pair as a shortcut on your home screen. Tap on it to launch your pre-configured app combo. And yes, it does remember your last used split screen ratio, saving you some valuable setup time.",

    "title": "15 Shows Like 'Bridgerton' You Should Watch Next",
    "description": "Bridgerton's not the only sexy period drama around.",
    "fullText": "Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes' candy-colored, ultra-stylized period piece has been a legitimate sensation for Netflix, adapting the Julia Quinn novel series that itself owes plenty to Jane Austen (as does just about any Regency romance). With a large, rotating ensemble—led, perhaps, by Nicola Coughlan's Penelope Bridgerton, who is ably assisted by Adjoa Andoh, Jonathan Bailey, Ruth Gemmell, Polly Walker, and Julie Andrews (as the voice of the mysterious Lady Whistledown)—the show revels in the tropes of the literature of the era while turning up the dial on sex, scandal, and drama. With four seasons and a spin-off, Bridgerton doesn't show signs of slowing down—but it's hardly the only hot period drama in town.\n\nWhile not quite going full Bridgerton in terms of hyper-stylization, this 1870s-set adaptation of an unfinished Edith Wharton novel isn't afraid to take several liberties in terms of costuming and music (see, for example, a key second season moment set to Sabrina Carpenter's \"Looking at Me.\") The buccaneers of the title are among the so-called dollar princesses of the era: Nan St. George (Kristine Froseth) and her friends are young women from upperclass American families on the make among the British aristocracy—the Americans get titles, and the English lords get to keep their frequently cash-poor estates running. What starts as soapy mercenary mission for the strong and spirited young women becomes a hunt for true love. It's been renewed for a third season at Apple. Stream The Buccaneers on Apple TV+.\n\nWhat if we did a steamy period drama involving England's first (if only for nine days) queen, Jane Grey? But with an oppressed class of humans who can turn into animals? Based on a book from Cynthia Hand, Brodi Ashton, and Jodi Meadows, the show stars Emily Bader as the titular queenly contender, dealing with a dying king cousin, a sketchy marriage, and competition from sisters Elizabeth and Mary. The magic and shapeshifting make the whole thing sufficiently bonkers and a lot of fun, kicking off with the invocation: \"She could have been the leader England needed. Instead, history remembers her as the ultimate damsel in distress. Fuck that.\" Stream My Lady Jane on Prime Video.\n\nCatherine the Great had a little bit of a moment a couple of years back, kicked off by that high-profile HBO miniseries starring Helen Mirren. This is not that. The opening credits offer up that this is an “occasionally true story,” so you know what you're in for. No real history lessons here, but a legitimately funny political satire, and of costume dramas in general, from the guy who co-wrote The Favourite, and starring everyone’s favourite Fanning alongside Nicholas Hoult. He plays Emperor Peter III, the husband who Catherine would ultimately overthrow, and the show plays on the sexual tension (and sometimes outright lust) between this married couple/political rivals always on the verge of either killing each other or ripping each other's clothes off. Stream The Great on Hulu.\n\nJulian Fellowes made period drama buzz-worthy with Downton Abbey, and does something similar here while shifting the time and place to the 1880s in New York City. We're introduced to the world of upper and then extremely upper-class New York City society by Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson), poor relation to the estranged aunties who take her in, and Peggy Scott (Denée Benton), a young Black writer from a solidly middle-class family who becomes a secretary to Christine Baranski's Agnes van Rhijn. Old-money Agnes and sister Ada (Cynthia Nixon) live across the street from new-money social climbers the Russells (led with juicy imperiousness by Carrie Coon's Bertha); established society isn't keen on letting in these upstarts—though money very much talks. In one sense, the stakes here could not possibly be lower (Bertha wants a better seat at the opera! Twink footman invents a new clock!)—so why is the show so addictive? It's been renewed for a fourth season. Stream The Gilded Age on HBO Max.\n\nSanditon is based on Jane Austen's final, incomplete work, which allows for plenty of creative leeway—it doesn't have the stylistic whimsy of Bridgerton, but serves as a purer distillation of the regency-drama thrills that Austen bequeathed to us. Here, the wildly independent Charlotte Heywood (Rose Williams) sets out to reinvent herself while moving to the title's growing seaside resort town (based, probably, on the real-life Worthing). She discovers that commercial prospects have drawn schemers and chancers to the area, creating a unique and vibrant social scene, with all of the balls and fancy costumes you'd expect. Naturally, romantic complications ensue when Charlotte gets judgy about the entrepreneurial Parker family and finds herself at odds with, and then getting close to, the wild youngest son, Sidney (Theo James). Stream Sanditon on PBS Passport or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nDickinson is so scrupulously weird that it gets points just for being unexpected. The most surprising thing about it, though, is that it's not merely idiosyncratic—it’s good. The show imagines the life of 19th-century poet Emily Dickinson, with the conceit that she didn’t fit especially well in her own time, a fact the show reflects stylistically through the casual use of anachronisms and more modern sensibilities (think Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette or, for that matter, Bridgerton). It’s also beautifully filmed and acted, and impressively light for a show about a figure as mysterious and haunted as Emily herself. Stream Dickinson on Apple TV+.\n\nMoving the clock back a few centuries and heading to Italy, The Decameron is a funny, dark, ultimately surprisingly humane (after a fashion) show that takes on Giovanni Boccaccio's 14th-century short story collection with Bridgerton-esque swagger. With the plague ravaging Florence, a bunch of nobles and attendants make their way to a countryside villa to wait out the plague and drain the liquor supplies. Rules and mores are turned upside down, particularly by the servant Licisca (Tanya Reynolds), who kind of accidentally kills her lady on the way to the villa and decides to take her place. Somehow, despite being about mostly terrible people, this makes for an entirely addictive binge experience that deserved a lot more attention than it got when it was released. Stream The Decameron on Netflix.\n\nThe show may play fast and loose with history, but does remind us that the Tudors were far hornier than all those archbishops would have us believe. The show’s Jonathan Rhys Meyers is quite a bit hotter and probably a fair bit more lovable than the actual sociopathic, serial-killing Henry—but many of the women characters give as well as they get (both politically and in bed), particularly Natalie Dormer’s Anne Boleyn. Stream The Tudors on Paramount+ and Prime Video.\n\nWe didn't come here for historical accuracy, and this CW drama isn't offering much. Adelaide Kane stars as Queen Mary Stuart, better known as Mary, Queen of Scots, beginning the series as a teenage girlboss coming of age while also coming into her royal power. It's soapy, sexy, and a little bit campy—which I absolutely mean as a compliment. Stream Reign on Prime Video.\n\nWith much of the heightened style of Bridgerton, but a steampunk aesthetic, Washington Black follows a young genius (Ernest Kingsley Jr.), once enslaved, with as inventive a mind and spirit as any Jules Verne character as he comes under the mentorship of Sterling K. Brown's Medwin Harris. That introduction to a larger world sets our lead off on a series of adventures that are whimsical without ignoring the particular dangers and challenges to be faced by a Black man in the 19th century. In the absence of more complex narratives about real historical figures, this show (and the Esi Edugyan novel on which it's based) at least centers the notion that Black North American history included innovation, progress, and even joy. Stream Washington Black on Hulu.\n\nLet's head over to Madrid, just a few decades earlier than Bridgerton, where Clara Belmonte (Michelle Jenner) has just taken a job in the kitchens of the Duke of Castamar (Roberto Enríquez). He's been a virtual recluse since the unexpected death of his wife, though now the King and various family members are pressuring him to get back on the horse, literally and figuratively, and fulfill his obligations as a noble. Clara, on the other hand, had developed a bit of agoraphobia following the execution of her father, and she's perfectly content to toil in the gloomy kitchens rather than go outside. Of course, the grieving Duke takes notice of her just as he's being plied with marriage prospects. Plenty of characters, subplots, and sex in this Spanish import. Stream The Cook of Castamar on Netflix.\n\nA fun and fast-moving historical crime drama, the show (heavily) dramatizes the live of the real-life Poët, Italy's first female lawyer—disbarred as the series opens in 1883 because LADY LAWYER?! WHAT? While she fights the ruling, she takes a job at her brother's law firm where, of course, she's the real brains of the operation, solving big cases in grand period style (and with a fair bit of sex, as well). It's been renewed for a third season. Stream The Law According to Lidia Poët on Netflix.\n\nHarlots takes the historical costume drama in unique directions, and deserved more attention than it got during its three-season run. Its women aren’t dressed in fancy dresses because they’re royalty, but because they’re high-end sex workers (if the title didn’t make clear) in Georgian England. When Margaret Wells moves her brothel to Soho, she comes into direct competition with her own former madam, who runs a high-end establishment in the same neighborhood. It’s got more sex and moves at a faster pace than more traditional period pieces, and the chess game between rival houses (as they both fight the male-dominated law enforcement establishment) makes for juicy entertainment. Stream Harlots on Hulu.\n\nThough her love dared not speak its name, the real-life Anne Lister certainly had no problem putting words to it—something like five million of them across her many diaries. So many, in fact, that the production of this show necessitated new transcriptions of works that hadn't been fully examined, despite having been written in the 1830s. Suranne Jones stars as Anne Lister, landowner and budding industrialist who returns to her inherited family estate only to discover that the neighbors are snatching coal from her land—and also that Ann Walker (Sophie Rundle), a wealthy estate owner, is looking pretty fine. It's a clever, funny series, and its use of Lister's prolific diaries gives it a real sense of verisimilitude in its depiction of a queer trailblazer. Stream Gentleman Jack on HBO Max or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThis one's probably obvious, given its direct relationship, but, just in case you missed it, let's give this Bridgerton spin-off series its due. Maintaining much of the original show's style, but with a laser focus on the title character, Charlotte rather brilliantly crafts a passionate, tortured romance between the Queen (here played as a young woman by India Amarteifio, with Golda Rosheuvel reprising the role for the framing bits), and King George III (Corey Mylchreest). The pressures of royal life and the king's growing mental illness create a rocky road for the young couple, but their passion is moving and deeply, deeply horny. Stream Queen Charlotte on Netflix.",

RageCheck is a potentially useful tool here.\n\nBuilt using concepts from social science research, this website can analyze any link or screenshot. It points out examples of potentially manipulative language, from us-versus-them framing to emotionally loaded phrasing. \"The system analyzes text for linguistic patterns commonly associated with manipulative framing—language optimized to provoke high-arousal reactions over understanding,\" says the methodology page. \"It does not assess factual accuracy or political bias.\"\n\nUsing the site is simple: just paste a link to an article and hit Enter. After a few moments, you'll see a statistical breakdown of the potentially manipulative language in the piece across five categories—emotional heat, us versus them, moral outrage, black-and-white thinking, and fight picking. The article is excerpted below, with examples of these tactics highlighted. In the left panel you'll see a \"Bait Score,\" which is an attempt to calculate how manipulative the article is being. Below that, you'll see a list of the potentially manipulative techniques employed in the article.\n\nNone of this is intended to be used as an alternative to fact checking or serve as some kind of truth-detecting machine. \"A high score means content uses manipulative framing—it doesn't mean the underlying claims are false,\" says the about page. \"Conversely, a low score doesn't mean content is true.\"\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the techniques this tool detects also aren't necessarily bad. Some news stories really should inspire moral outrage, especially in the context of an opinion piece or editorial. Regardless, there's still value in identifying those techniques.\n\nBasically, this is a tool that can help you think critically about the media you're consuming, not do that critical thinking for you.

    "description": "Learn how response caching in GraphOS Router enables entity-level caching to reduce subgraph load and improve query latency.",
    "fullText": "Cache subgraph responses to improve query performance\n\nLearn how GraphOS Router can cache subgraph query responses using Redis to improve your query latency for entities in the supergraph.\n\nAn entity gets its fields from one or more subgraphs. To respond to a client request for an entity, GraphOS Router must make multiple subgraph requests. Different clients requesting the same entity can make redundant, identical subgraph requests.\n\nResponse caching enables the router to cache origin responses and reuse them across queries. (An origin is a data source.) The router caches two kinds of data:\n\nRoot query fields: Cached as complete units (the entire response for that root field)\n\nEntity representations: Cached independently—each origin's contribution to an entity is cached separately and can be reused across different queries. (See _entities query.)\n\nThe router uses Redis to cache data from origin query responses. The cache organizes data by origin and entity representation, so different clients requesting the same data hit shared cache entries. You can use the cache debugger to see exactly what's being cached during development.\n\nReduce the load on your underlying services\n\nImprove overall latencies for client requests\n\nThe router provides a GraphQL-aware cache with advantages over a generic CDN. It caches at the entity and root field level—GraphQL-native and reusable across users and requests.\n\nGraphQL responses present unique caching challenges that traditional HTTP caching doesn't address well. A typical GraphQL response combines data from multiple sources with varying freshness requirements and visibility constraints:\n\nMixed TTLs: A single response might include product prices (change weekly), inventory (change constantly), and user reviews (change occasionally). Traditional response caching forces you to use the shortest time to live (TTL)—the duration data remains valid in cache—for the entire response.\n\nPersonalized and public data: Responses often mix public data (product details) with private data (user's cart, viewing history). This makes full-response caching either impossible or requires separate cache entries per user.\n\nHigh duplication: Different queries requesting similar entities result in duplicate cached data. For example, a product list query and a product detail query both cache the same product name and price.\n\nResponse caching solves these challenges by caching origin responses with flexible cache control. The router determines cache TTLs from the Cache-Control HTTP headers returned by your origins—these headers are derived from @cacheControl directives in your schema. When an origin response contains multiple entity representations, the router uses the minimum TTL value. Different responses can have different TTLs and visibility settings, and you can actively invalidate cached data when you know it has changed.\n\nCompared to caching entire client responses, response caching in the router supports finer control over:\n\nthe time to live (TTL) and programmatic invalidation of cached data\n\nthe amount of data being cached\n\nsharing cached data across users while maintaining privacy for personalized data\n\nFor example, consider the Products and Inventory subgraphs from the Entities guide:\n\nAssume the client for a shopping cart application requests the following for each product in the cart:\n\nThe product's name and price from the Products subgraph\n\nThe product's availability in inventory from the Inventory subgraph\n\nIf caching the entire client response, it would require a short TTL because the cart data can change often and the real-time inventory has to be up to date. A client-response cache couldn't be shared between users, because each cart is personal. A client-response cache might also duplicate data because the same products might appear in multiple carts.\n\nWith response caching enabled for this example, the router can:\n\nStore each product's description and price separately with a long TTL\n\nMinimize the number of subgraph requests made for each client request, with some client requests fetching all product data from the cache and requiring no subgraph requests\n\nShare the product cache between all users\n\nCache the cart per user, with a small amount of data\n\nCache inventory data with a short TTL or not cache it at all\n\nFor example, the following diagram shows how a price entity can be cached and then combined with purchase and inventory fragments to serve a products query. Because price data is subject to change less often than inventory data, it makes sense to cache it with a different TTL.",

    "fullText": "I’m Isaac Saul, and this is Tangle. You are reading a preview of a members-only Friday edition. To read it in full, you'll be asked to subscribe.\n\nDid someone forward you this email? \n\nOne of my favorite things about Tangle is the process that happens before publication — the one our readers and listeners never get to see.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about this in recent months: How much debate, dialogue, and discussion goes into everything we publish. How much I learn from the conversations we have pre-publication. How desperately our country needs more of what I believe our staff models every day. I also think a lot about how trust in the media is at an all-time low, and all the innovative ways organizations like ours could try to win that trust back.\n\nThen, a few days ago, during a discussion in our team Slack channel, I fired off this message:\n\nAfter sending the message, I couldn’t shake the thought. Maybe we should publish a transcript of that conversation. Maybe, actually, showing what happens behind-the-scenes would interest our audience, model civil debate, and help build trust in our brand. In other words: Good content, good citizenship, good business. That’s a win-win-win.\n\nSo, deciding I’d ask for permission after the fact, I did something slightly invasive: I started copying and pasting some Slack messages into a Google Doc. I pulled out four exchanges from the past few weeks that I thought would be interesting for our readers to see, and then I told my staff I was going to “leak” them.\n\nThe first is a conversation about whether my take on the investigation into Jerome Powell crossed some kind of Rubicon of Trump criticism, and whether I should address that explicitly with our audience. The second is our team’s initial reaction to Associate Editor Audrey Moorehead’s take on the oral arguments from the Supreme Court cases about state bans on trans women in women’s sports. The third is a debate about whether we should officially move The Washington Post editorial board from “left” to “right” (something readers have written in to ask about). And the fourth is the initial conversation about my take on the Minneapolis ICE shooting.\n\nEach of these transcripts reflect the conversations almost exactly as they happened. Nothing has been changed except some punctuation and capitalization for readability (since normal people, unlike our Managing Editor Ari Weitzman, use shorthand and incorrect punctuation in Slack). In a few cases, we also omitted interruptions or asides — for instance, sometimes during a debate or discussion, someone will chime in with a message like, “Sorry to interrupt, but here’s an idea for the subject line of the email.” I’ve left those out. We also decided to note threaded responses — comments responding directly to other messages — as block quotes (as shown below).\n\nAlso, these conversations do not capture nearly all the debate and discussion that we have during newsletter production. Indeed, the bulk of our staff’s back and forth happens inside the Google document where we edit every day’s issue as a team, and that process involves a few more editors who aren’t in our Slack channel. We’ll also have in-person conversations among the editors working side by side in our office, direct messages between individual editors, and occasional calls to discuss more nuanced concerns.\n\nStill, as you’ll see, this is an authentic look into how we discuss and debate the minutiae of our content every day. Below are some very honest, forthright conversations — some exchanges that were so forthright we even considered taking them out — and many things I sincerely doubt other media outlets would ever make public. I’m curious what you all think, if you found this exercise helpful, and any reactions or comments you might have.\n\nAri Weitzman (Managing Editor): I struggled editing the take today. I wanted to find some pushback to the tone you took, but I don’t have any. If anything, my edits intensified the language of your position. I really loved this take.\n\nAri Weitzman (Managing Editor): This feels actually like a line-in-the-sand moment for you, possibly for Tangle, with covering Trump. To the point where I might even suggest pulling a ripcord and dedicating a Friday edition to saying something like “Trump has crossed a Rubicon” or just answering mailbag questions from readers concerned about the impartiality of our coverage as the Trump criticism crescendos.\n\nIsaac Saul (Executive Editor): Yeah, it’s just like… C’mon. I’m not even trafficking in the “well let’s see” stuff at this point, and I think it’s disingenuous to.\n\nWill Kaback (Senior Editor): Yeah I mean every conservative editorial board has come out against this. NY Post, Washington Examiner, and then the ones you'd expect (National Review/WSJ). Meanwhile, The Federalist, Hot Air, PJ Media, etc. have published almost nothing about it — even news articles — which is always telling.\n\nAudrey Moorehead (Associate Editor): I agree with that assessment. The tone of this piece feels different even from past criticisms of Trump. I’m not sure how I feel about it overall — I basically agree with the take, and I don’t think the take should be edited down to become more milquetoast and less honest. Nevertheless, the tone bothers me, and I could see it losing a lot of conservative readers.\n\nAudrey Moorehead (Associate Editor): Of the two approaches you suggested, Ari, I’d favor a reader mailbag version, though I also think we could run a “crossing the Rubicon” piece and then a mailbag in response.\n\nIsaac Saul (Executive Editor): Yeah, I don’t really feel like we need to write some “crossing of the Rubicon” piece, which we already kinda did with “yes things are pretty bad.” I’m happy to answer mailbag Qs about it, but I’d rather just let the take stand on its own. I feel like drawing more attention to it is unhelpful in almost every way.\n\nAri Weitzman (Managing Editor): On point two, I agree, I don’t want to suggest another piece that just emphasizes today’s take. On point one, honestly, it seems like things have gotten even worse since then — and the posture you’re taking in Tangle is more oppositional to Trump at root. I felt like the moment on [Suspension of the Rules] when you said you don’t think you’ve ever forgiven Trump for [January 6] was informative (for me, and I think for listeners), and I think something that gives you a chance to talk about this stance would be helpful. If today’s survey results [from the Jan. 12 survey on “Donroe Doctrine”] are any indication, we still have a good deal of Trump-friendly and traditional conservative readers we should speak to.\n\nAudrey Moorehead (Associate Editor): ^ I agree with that. I also think that a large amount of our newsletter readers don’t listen to [Suspension of the Rules] and as such your feelings as expressed in the newsletter feel more out of left field — I think you should address those people.\n\nIsaac Saul (Executive Editor): Today’s take didn’t feel Rubicon-y to me which is interesting. Just feel like it’s obvious and a lot of conservative writers stating it plainly. But maybe that’s the point in terms of my perspective.\n\nAudrey Moorehead (Associate Editor): As far as Tangle goes, I think the harshness of your tone here — with no buttresses, moderate qualifiers, etc, and even with an explicit rejection of those moderating qualifiers — is crossing a Rubicon.\n\nAri Weitzman (Managing Editor): ^^^ Yes, thank you, Audrey. The explicit rejection of the moderation you would have struck in March is what I’m realizing stood out to me.\n\nLindsey Knuth (Associate Editor): I feel like we’ve been beating the drum calling out political prosecutions on both sides — and this one seems particularly egregious, given its effect on the economy and targeting of a clearly reliable figure. It didn’t overly read as a broader castigation of Trump — I'm curious whether our conservative readers would support these charges? I see pro-fed-independence as pretty nonpartisan.\n\nWill Kaback (Senior Editor): ^To that point, this is just about the only defense of the investigation that I could find, and I think the headline speaks for itself:\n\nWill Kaback (Senior Editor): To me, a Rubicon moment would be a take like this on an issue where there is substantive disagreement and debate between the sides, and Isaac just solely advocates for the Trump-critical view because he feels Trump has moved beyond the pale.\n\nIsaac Saul (Executive Editor): Interesting discussion. Wish we had a podcast running, lol — maybe we publish the transcript of this Slack? (Half kidding)\n\nAudrey Moorehead (Associate Editor): Today feels like a Rubicon for me because I think the defining feature of Tangle has long been that, even in moments where it doesn’t make sense, Isaac is willing to add those reasonable discussions about, say, Powell’s tenure — which always reads to me as a peacemaking gesture to those who disagree — but then explains why they’re irrelevant. I also think that today’s take will be more grating for conservative readers presented alongside the reader Q [about Renee Good’s death], which is another situation where I feel like Isaac is usually more moderate but is today being more overt about his moral outrage over the situation.\n\nAri Weitzman (Managing Editor): That’s a good [perspective], thank you for that. I think I’m getting a sense that the answer to the implied question of “what’s changed” is, “The admin is openly doing political prosecution and openly lying about what its masked quasi-police force is doing, and is ramping up both of these things,” and maybe that’s what’s scratching at me as something to get into explicitly and can explain the stance to conservative readers.\n\nAudrey Moorehead (Associate Editor): Yeah, maybe. But, as someone who does know that that’s the underlying impetus for the change in attitude that's slowly occurring in Isaac’s takes, it doesn’t exactly alleviate the way that the tone grates with me.\n\nAudrey Moorehead (Associate Editor): I do want to make one suggestion, though, which is — to Will’s point about bipartisan condemnation of this — could we explicate that bipartisan condemnation in the take? Right now we mention Republicans who are against the move, but that paragraph is still (rightly) broadly critical of congressional GOP spinelessness. But I think pointing out that even conservative commentators are condemning this will be a relevant point that might soften the take to more right-leaning readers — I can make a suggestion [in the draft], I think it could go in the very graf where Isaac says there’s no need to include the discussion about Powell\n\nLindsey Knuth (Associate Editor): Like the suggestion Audrey — I think it could go in a few different places, but works where you put it\n\nIsaac Saul (Executive Editor): I like Audrey’s suggestion. We could even add what Will said — that some places just straight up ignored it?\n\nAri Weitzman (Managing Editor): I think that’d be very powerful. For what it’s worth, I think we can do more with this section about why this is different to you and lengthen it if we wanted to. NOT BY A TON, but we are currently under 4400 [words].\n\nIsaac Saul (Executive Editor): Added something.\n\nAri Weitzman (Managing Editor): Looks great. Small edits from Audrey and me.",

You'll be doing a lot of digging throughout your journey, but the activity itself is well worth your while. Not only will you be able to complete exhibits in the Museum, but you'll likely end up with a lot of cash. We've got you covered with a step-by-step explanation, along with a list of all Fossils in the game, in this article.\n\nFind all of our guides on Nintendo's beloved life sim, including those on the 3.0 update, in our Animal Crossing: New Horizons guides hub.\n\nBefore you can start collecting Fossils in the game, you must do a basic task for Tom Nook in the Resident Services tent. You'll just need to hand over five unique bugs or fish to him:\n\nTom Nook will call his friend, Blathers, when you donate unique specimens. Eventually, he'll give you a construction item for Blathers' tent.\n\nYou should be able to gather Fossils in Animal Crossing: New Horizons soon enough. Once you have the construction item, place it anywhere on your island. After a daily reset at 5 a.m. local time, Blathers' tent will be fully built.\n\nBlathers knows you've already donated a bunch of stuff earlier, but he still wants you to provide 15 additional specimens of unique bugs, fish, or fossils.\n\nNote: Assuming you found a bunch of insects and fish earlier, don't sell them to Timmy. Instead, you can just place them somewhere on your island. Once Blathers arrives, you can donate the unique specimens to him to quickly add to the remainder of the tally.\n\nTo obtain Fossils in the game, you need to craft a Shovel. The recipe for the initial option, the Flimsy Shovel, comes from Blathers. You need 5x Hardwood to craft it, so make sure you already have an Axe.\n\nIn any case, roam around the island and look for star-shaped markers on the ground. Use the Shovel to dig them up to obtain a Fossils that still have to be identified.\n\nNote: There are usually three or more dig spots on your island. New dig spots appear every daily reset.\n\nAfter finding a Fossil, you must hand it over to Blathers so it can be assessed and identified. Blathers will also ask if you want to learn more about the ancient creatures' parts that you discovered, but it's up to you if you want to have a chat about those.\n\nWhat about extra specimens? Well, don't fret. Generally speaking, you should only give one of each unique specimen to Blathers to add to your collection. As for all the extras that you obtain later:\n\nBelow is a list of Fossils in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, along with their respective selling price. Note that several of these form complete sets that are exhibited in the Museum. The larger the dinosaur/creature, the more body parts it has that are part of the set.\n\nSome Fossils are standalone items. You only need one of these, and the firstone you donate to Blathers will be exhibited in the Museum:\n\nThat does it for our guide on Animal Crossing: New Horizons Fossils and specimens. Keep growing your Museum collection so everyone can marvel at your exhibits. If you need help with other matters, you can always head to our guides hub.",

    "title": "Hands-On Introduction to Unikernels",
    "description": "Learn what a unikernel is and how it compares to a Linux container. Build and run your first unikernel inside a playground box.",
    "fullText": "The source of this tutorial is available on GitHub.\nFeel free to use that source repository to contact the author with questions, discuss possible improvements or report mistakes.\n\nVirtual machines provide a level of isolation unattainable by any flavor of Linux container.\nVirtualization technologies are widely adopted in the industry as a response to stringent security requirements, particularly in environments that share hardware between multiple tenants and must guarantee opaque boundaries between those tenants.\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise that cloud hyperscalers provide access to compute in various forms of virtual machines1 rather than some abstraction on top of a shared OS kernel.\n\nBut reaping the security benefits of virtual machines typically requires compromising on performance aspects.\nCold booting an entire operating system takes significantly more time than spawning an OS process, which hinders dynamic application scaling.\nAlso with each VM's kernel making independent scheduling decisions on top of the same hardware resources (CPU, memory, network, GPUs, ...), running multiple general-purpose operating systems such as Linux side by side requires smart hypervisors in order to distribute those resources optimally2.\n\nYou will often encounter the term \"Micro VM\" to describe a type of virtual machine that attempts to address the aforementioned limitations by reducing their memory footprint through restricted device support and guest3 functionalities.\nWhile this approach demonstrates measurable improvements to boot times, the guest itself still carries the overhead of a full, general-purpose operating system.\n\nUnikernels propose a solution to that exact problem.\n\nThroughout this tutorial, you will learn what a unikernel is made of and even build one yourself.\nYou will be guided throughout the steps required for running this unikernel on any Linux host, then package it as an OCI image that can be run by Docker.\n\nIn essence, a unikernel is a highly specialized type of kernel that is tailored for running one application, and that application specifically.\n\nThe application is the kernel, as much as the kernel is the application.\n\nThis design avoids paying the performance penalty of switching contexts on system calls between the user space and the kernel space, a behavior that is unavoidable in traditional operating systems.\nIt allows a direct and quicker access to the hardware.\n\nUnikernels operate in a single address space.\n\nThere exists different types of unikernel projects.\nSome are tailored to run applications written in specific programming languages, others are more versatile.\nSome are monolithic, others are modular.\nSome require compiling and linking the application in a special way, others are able to run unmodified ELF executables.\n\nDespite those differences, all strive to achieve specialization in a similar way: by selecting only the components of the software stack which are relevant to the application.\nFor instance, there is no use for disk filesystem drivers in a piece of software which interacts solely with the network and does not write any data to disk.\nLikewise, because the unikernel is a single application, it does not require any user management or scheduling facilities.\nThese become opportunities for reducing the software footprint by cutting on bloat, also reducing its attack surface by extension.\n\nWe often refer to the unikernel paradigm as \"library operating systems\".\n\nSpecializing a unikernel by components selection.\n\nThe artifact produced by building a unikernel is a kernel executable that comprises the application, along with only the parts of the OS kernel, libraries and possible runtime that were selected for that application.\nBecause a unikernel is meant to be materialized as a virtual machine, the produced artifact is specific to the target hypervisor (KVM4, Xen5, VMware, ...) and CPU architecture.\n\nThe Unikernel Alliance is the home of a few active unikernel (and unikernel-centric) projects to peruse:\n\nThere also exists a few noteworthy unikernel projects which are not part of the Unikernel Alliance:\n\nAs a result, unikernels offer increased security and performance compared to a containerized Linux process.\n\nIt would feel dishonest to praise unikernels for their many benefits without acknowledging some of their limitations.\n\nNowadays, the comparison of unikernels with Linux containers seems unavoidable, therefore the aspects enumerated below focus deliberately on use-cases that a container typically enables and which presents challenges when running the same application as a unikernel.\n\nWe are starting with some fully embraced bait; the absence of shells and users is absolutely desired for reducing the attack surface of applications.\n\nYet, when comes the need to troubleshoot a misbehaving live application it is hard to beat the convenience of containers.\nNeed to use a specific tool but the container's root filesystem is only one statically linked executable?\nNo problem, attach your favorite debugging shell to the namespaces of the container, become root if you please, and off you go.\n\nWith a unikernel? You better be sure that the application has comprehensive observability facilities built-in.\n\nUnikernels are inherently single-process OSes due to their single address space design.\n\nA range of applications use the POSIX fork system call to create child processes such as additional workers, data snapshotters, etc.\nRunning such applications as unikernels present challenges and require trade-offs.\nSome notable examples:\n\nContainers being regular OS processes, they do not suffer from such limitation.\n\nNote that a recent research paper shows promising advancements in supporting fork in single-address-space operating systems: μFork: Supporting POSIX fork Within a Single-Address-Space OS (September 2025).\n\nUnikernels are still considered a niche technology despite building on concepts developed in the late 1990s.\nAs such, they lack the standardization that emerges once a technology achieves a certain degree of maturity.\nThis means that there is currently no compatibility whatsoever between unikernel projects and their associated tooling.\n\nInterestingly, compatibility with container-centric and cloud-native tooling is limited but not nonexistent, as you will discover later in this tutorial.\n\nThis lack of standardization is no different from the early days of containers, which weren't standardized either until several years into the existence of Docker containers.\n\nBecause unikernels are purpose-built and combine both the user and kernel code, they generally require a deeper knowledge about the software stack than is required for building conventional application artifacts.\nPorting an application as a unikernel may require specialist knowledge from the runtime through the kernel interfaces all the way down to the hardware.\n\nAs previously mentioned, there exists unikernel projects that can run unmodified ELF executables in a binary-compatible mode (POSIX compliant).\nEven though these do not enable the full, uncompromised performance and security benefits of purpose-built unikernels, they preserve a number of those benefits over a general-purpose, multi-user operating system kernel like Linux.\nThey also bring the process of building a unikernel closer to the one of assembling a container image. Win-win.\n\nFinally, one limitation that stems from the virtual machine model and not the unikernel architecture in itself is the lack of supporting facilities for inter-process communications.\nWithout a shared kernel to provide such facilities, applications running as unikernels must communicate over the network or via channels provided by their underlying hypervisor.\n\nContainers allow multiple processes to be confined together and communicate over UNIX domain sockets, POSIX message queues, a loopback network interface, OS signals, etc.\n\nNow that you are equipped with general knowledge about unikernels, let's begin with the hands-on part of the tutorial, shall we?\n\nIn this tutorial, you are going to build the Nginx web server as a Unikraft unikernel, from sources.\n\nNginx is a classic example of server application that is both incredibly widespread6 and easy to interact with.\n\nThe Unikraft kernel was chosen for this tutorial because it ticks the following boxes:\n\nThe playground box is pre-initialized with the following two directories inside your HOME:\n\nStart by changing your working directory to nginx/. You will remain in there throughout most of this tutorial:\n\nThis directory contains a few files which are solely responsible for configuring and building the unikernel:\n\nUse the tabs below for a description of the purpose of each of these files:\n\nA file in which kernel options with non-default values are specified.\n\nOptions which are specific to our flavor of the unikernel are enabled in this file and will be merged with the defaults of the Unikraft kernel:\n\nA declaration of kernel options which are custom to the application, in KConfig language.\n\nIn the case of our Nginx application, the only option APPNGINX is used to auto-select a few additional kernel options, highlighted below.\nThis is mostly a convenience to keep the defconfig file lean.\n\nThe directory that contains the sources required to build our unikernel.\nIn this tutorial, all required sources are symbolic links to the sources/ directory described above.\n\nA minimal Makefile that calls into Unikraft's core Makefile, passing a list of paths to our sources stored in workdir/.\n\nFirst, a kernel needs a configuration, and a unikernel in no exception.\nYou have already encountered the qemu-x86_64.defconfig file, you are now going to generate the full kernel configuration based on those few customized values:\n\nThis command should have generated a file named .config inside the workspace:\n\nIt contains an aggregation of all the kernel options explicitly or implicitly selected inside the workspace, merged with the defaults from the Unikraft core.\n\nInstead of invoking the defconfig goal, you could have selected kernel options via a terminal-based kernel configuration interface.\n\nSince your .config file is already generated, opening this interface will display the options that were selected by the defconfig goal.\nGive it a try!\nIf you have ever built the Linux kernel from sources this should look familiar, even spark a bit of nostalgia :)\n\n(You might have to expand the side panel for your web-based terminal to have large enough dimensions.)\n\nWith the kernel configuration generated, you are now ready to proceed with the build. Let's go:\n\nThe build process goes through a few steps, including fetching the source code of the libraries and application (Nginx) which are not yet cached locally:\n\nUnfortunately, about 10 seconds in, an error comes and ruins the party already:\n\nThis is part of the tutorial and a good segue into some peculiarity about the unikernel you are building.\n\nIf you take a step back and think about what a typical application package contains—be it an OS package or a container image—you might be able to guess where we are heading.\nLet's take a look at the files included with the nginx-common package of the playground box's distribution:\n\nThat's right, a bunch of static resources.\nWhile some are support files for the playground's Linux distribution (service definition, logrotate config, docs) others, such as the highlighted ones, are required by the Nginx application to function.\n\nOn any Linux system, exposing such files to an application is commonly accepted as storing the files on a mounted filesystem and giving read/write permissions on these files to the UNIX user that the application is going to run as.\nIn a container image, those same files are either part of the root filesystem already, or bind mounted at run time to the root filesystem that the container pivots to.\n\nBut our unikernel does not have access to a filesystem exposed through a shared host kernel, so those files must be provided to the application by different means.\nOne option could have been to enable selected filesystem drivers via kernel options and share files from the host at run time through the target hypervisor, similarly to a bind mount on Linux.\n\nSharing files from the host over the 9p protocol.\n\nHowever, the option we selected in this tutorial is to embed the files in an initial ramdisk (initrd) using the kernel option CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_CI_EINITRD=y (and related CONFIG_LIBVFSCORE_AUTOMOUNT_* configuration options).\nWith this approach, the initial ramdisk is expanded into a root filesystem mounted as a read-write RAM-based filesystem (ramfs) upon booting the unikernel.\nA perfect solution for static and non-persistent files.\n\nEmbedding files into the unikernel as an init ramdisk.\n\nWe pinpointed earlier the lack of standardization across unikernel projects.\nThe approaches proposed in this section are a demonstration of mechanisms and configurations which are highly Unikraft-specific and may or may not have an equivalent in other unikernels.\n\nThe files that need to be embedded are already part of your workspace and stored in the rootfs/ directory:\n\nYou need to convert the contents of this directory into a cpio8 archive. (Remember the error message?)\nThe Unikraft core includes a support script which achieves just that:\n\nThe result is an archive named initrd.cpio containing all the files staged for embedding into the unikernel artifact at build time.\n\nThe format of a cpio archive isn't that different from that of a tarball.\nFiles are merely concatenated with their contents separated by some headers and metadata.\n\nYou can print the contents of the generated initrd.cpio using the following command and verify that it matches that of the rootfs/ directory:\n\nYou should now have all required resources sorted out:\n\nLet's try building the unikernel one more time:\n\nAfter about 2 minutes, you should see the build succeed with a final linking and stripping of the build artifacts:\n\nAll files resulting from the build are written to the build/ directory.\nThe one without an extension in the list below is the kernel:\n\nThe base name of the generated kernel artifacts follows the naming convention:\n\nYou can verify that the file name nginx_qemu-x86_64 indeed matches the kernel configuration used during the build:\n\nThe format of this kernel is an ELF executable, just like the Linux kernel that your playground box is currently running on:\n\nOne thing should be particularly striking about this artifact: its small size.\nThe Nginx application and all the OS components required for running it fit into... less than 2 MB!\n\nFor comparison, on the playground box's distribution the nginx binary, the GNU libc and the Linux kernel taken together weigh almost 60 MB:\n\nThe kernel you just built can be run as a machine.\nA unikernel could technically boot on a physical machine (e.g. your laptop) providing that it was built with drivers compatible with its hardware.\nHowever, unikernels are largely meant to run as virtual machines rather than physical ones, as mentioned in the introduction to this tutorial.\nThis is mostly for two reasons:\n\nYour nginx_qemu-x86_64 kernel is suitable for the KVM hypervisor and its userspace component in the QEMU10 virtual machine manager (VMM).\nYou will leverage both when running the unikernel on the playground box.\nProducing a unikernel for a different hypervisor (such as Xen) or a different VMM (such as Firecracker11) would have required different build time parameters (kernel options).\n\nThe KVM kernel module effectively turns the Linux host operating system into a type-1 hypervisor.\nTo leverage this virtualization solution, the host's CPU needs to support certain CPU instructions through virtualization extensions.\n\nVirtualization extensions for x86-based CPUs are denoted as:\n\nYou can check whether those extensions are enabled on the playground box by looking for the corresponding CPU flags:\n\nThe other requirement is that the host's Linux kernel includes the kvm module, expectedly.\n\nBoth of those requirements can conveniently be checked using a single command: kvm-ok.\n\nNo KVM module is available inside iximiuz Labs playgrounds, whether kvm_amd nor kvm_intel, even though the CPU could support it:\n\nThis is luckily not an obstacle, as QEMU is capable of running virtual machines without KVM support.\nMachines with emulated hardware do not offer the same performance as the ones with hardware-assisted virtualization, but this is totally acceptable in the context of this tutorial.\n\nSimply omit any KVM-related flag such as -enable-kvm in the following command and you should be good to go.\n\nLet's now run the kernel as a freshly created virtual machine using QEMU.\nNotice the unikernel executable you built in the previous section passed as argument, as well as kernel command-line parameters pointing at one of the files from your previously generated cpio archive:\n\nInterestingly, those kernel parameters do not look like typical OS kernel command-line parameters, and indeed they are not. Those parameters are Nginx command-line parameters!\nA unikernel has OS and application components built into a single kernel artifact, so this should hopefully make a lot of sense.\n\nShould you need to pass parameters to the core kernel components, you would have to keep them separated from the application's parameters with --, as follows:\n\nWe will use this mechanism in the next section of this tutorial.\n\nAs soon as the virtual machine is created, its console output will be printed to your terminal, just like when booting a Linux box.\nIt includes the BIOS messages and the unikernel's boot messages:\n\nThere are three notable things to be observed in this output:\n\nAll of this under 150 milliseconds, on emulated hardware.\n\nFor comparison, your current playground micro VM requires about 2 seconds just to reach the point where it can run its init process, and about half a second more for reaching the main user target, with hardware acceleration enabled.\n\nHaving to wait that long for starting a Nginx server would feel like an eternity.\n\nTake a look at the console logs of your playground Linux box and compare them with what you are currently seeing in your terminal :)\n\nSo, what else can we do with this unikernel at that point? Not much, at least not just yet.\nSince you did not create the virtual machine with any network device, you cannot perform any meaningful interaction with the Nginx server, such as sending a HTTP request to it.\nThis aspect was deliberately left out from this section.\nThe good news is that we are going to remediate to it in the next one.\n\nFor now, terminate the QEMU process by sending the key combination Ctrl+A followed by X on your keyboard.\n\nIn case this key sequence does not work for you, open a second terminal and interrupt the QEMU process from there:\n\nAs the BIOS sends control characters which tend to corrupt interactive terminals, consider resetting your terminal's state now to avoid glitches when typing future commands:\n\nBut that didn't make for a catchy heading.\n\nArguably, we could have covered a bit of the network configuration required for obtaining a HTTP response from Nginx in the previous section, and this tutorial could have ended here.\nExcept that would have meant passing on some very interesting ways of running unikernels alongside Linux containers.\n\nContainers are currently the dominant deployment unit in the cloud-native landscape.\nA rich ecosystem of technologies, rallied behind the Kubernetes12 project, allows virtually anyone to run services at \"Google-scale\" nowadays.\nMuch of this convenience stems from the assumption that everything is packaged and run like a container.\n\nCould unikernels, instead of competing against this ecosystem, tap into its richness to ease their adoption?\n\nIt turns out that this idea isn't new.\nSeveral projects have shown that it is possible to run applications as if they were a container, but with the enhanced isolation of a virtual machine.\nThose are presented in the section Secure Container Runtimes of the post Journey From Containerization To Orchestration And Beyond.\n\nIn this section, you will use two open source projects listed on the page of the Unikernel Alliance:\n\n... all of this using nothing but the docker CLI.\n\nBunny makes packaging unikernels as easy as it is to package containers.\nThe resulting images are standard OCI images that can be pushed to and pulled from any container registry.\n\nFirst off, change your working directory to oci/, assuming that you are currently still in the nginx/ workspace:\n\nThis directory contains a single file named bunnyfile with a YAML syntax.\n\nYou would be right to assume that a unikernel shall be packaged using instructions from a Dockerfile, like any other container image.\nHowever, because Bunny was designed to be used as a frontend for BuildKit13, it is able to parse its own build definition which is tailored for packaging the special software artifact which are unikernels.\n\nIn a bunnyfile, the generic and imperative instructions of a Dockerfile (ENV, COPY, RUN, etc.) are traded for declarative and structured attributes which describe the nature of the unikernel and how it should be run:\n\nThe Dockerfile syntax is also supported by Bunny as an alternative to the bunnyfile syntax.\n\nAccording to that last path instruction, Bunny expects the unikernel executable inside the current directory with the name nginx_qemu-x86_64, so you will need to copy it there:\n\nRun a Docker image build inside the current directory, using bunnyfile in place of the default Dockerfile, and see what happens:\n\nEven though bunny does not come pre-installed inside the playground box, the build completed without hurdle.\nIs this surprising? Upon closer inspection, it shouldn't be.\n\nBecause the first line in the bunnyfile is a syntax directive with a special meaning, BuildKit was able to understand that it had to load the bunny frontend dynamically from a container image and invoke it to generate its build graph:\n\nThe OCI images produced by Bunny have the peculiarity of being automatically labeled with some exotic key-values.\nYou can enumerate these by inspecting the lab/nginx-unikernel:latest image you created:\n\nWithout further ado, let's figure out what makes those labels useful.\n\nIn order to create and run a container, the containerd container manager invokes a container runtime that prepares the containerized process to run within the desired namespaces and cgroups hierarchy.\nIn the realm of Linux containers, the container runtime of reference is runc.\n\nBecause the detail of this flow is beyond the scope of this tutorial, feel free to take the challenge Create and Start a Container Manually With runc if you are interested in ramping up your knowledge about container runtimes.\nConsider reading the post Journey From Containerization To Orchestration And Beyond as well.\n\nrunc makes numerous assumptions about the way a container has to run:\n\nA unikernel is different. As a virtual machine running under the management of a virtual machine manager:\n\nFor those reasons, spinning up a unikernel–or in fact any kind of virtual machine–from a container image requires a container runtime that is aware of those distinctions and is capable of operating around them.\n\nIn containerd, there is a naming convention that allows selecting a specific runtime for running a container without having to configure containerd to know about that runtime.\n\nIt turns out that the urunc shim executable installed on the playground box follows that naming convention:\n\nSo all you need to do in order to pick urunc for running your Nginx unikernel image is specify that runtime name as an argument to docker container run.\nWe also set its name explicitly to unikernel to facilitate future docker commands:\n\nWhen the --runtime flag is not specified in docker container run commands, containerd chooses the runtime based on its own default.\nIn a vanilla containerd distribution, this default is runc:\n\nVerify that the unikernel is running (as a container):\n\nThen print its logs (console output):\n\nThe output is more or less identical to the one shown when you ran the unikernel via QEMU earlier.\n\nAs the BIOS sends control characters which tend to corrupt interactive terminals, consider resetting your terminal's state now to avoid glitches when typing future commands:\n\nIt doesn't end here.\nCheck the IP address assigned to the container:\n\nThen send a HTTP request to that IP address using curl:\n\nThis time around, networking is fully functional, and it appears to be working just like with a container!\n\nThat is great progress compared to what you ended up with at the end of the previous section.\nNot only interacting with the application running inside the guest is now a reality, but reaching that state was remarkably easy;\nyou did not need to use anything but docker commands, or even make adjustments to your unikernel.\n\nWe are now going to dissect what just happened in order to understand how making the unikernel feel like we are interacting with a Linux container is even possible.\n\nAs explained earlier in this tutorial, iximiuz Labs playgrounds do not support KVM.\nDuring its initialization, your playground box built and installed a patched version of urunc which omits certain problematic QEMU CLI flags such as -enable-kvm.\n\nIf you look at the processes currently running in your playground box, you should see a process with a familiar command line at the bottom of the list:\n\nThat's right, a QEMU process, parented to the urunc container shim, with arguments that look very similar to the ones you passed on the command line to create the virtual machine manually in the previous section of this tutorial.\n\nRemember those somewhat exotic labels set on the container image?\nYou just found the usage of two of them:\n\nThis parenting of qemu-system-x86_64 to the container shim is the reason why docker container logs printed the standard output (stdout) of the QEMU process, namely the virtual machine's console output.\n\nIf you manage to list the processes fast enough while the container is still being created, you will notice that the process with the container's PID was originally a urunc process (not to be mistaken for a urunc shim process):\n\nUpon starting the container, urunc eventually \"became\" the container process (qemu-system-x86_64) by means of a POSIX exec system call.\n\nThe author of this tutorial wrote extensively about what happens between the creation of the container shim and that of the container process in a post titled OCI runtime: container creation flow.\n\nThis parent-child relationship between the two processes also means that the \"unikernel container\" is a virtual machine monitored by QEMU.\nIn other words, where a regular Nginx container would have nginx running as the container process, urunc created a qemu-system-x86_64 process to run the unikernel.\n\nTo verify this, compare the process ID (PID) of the container seen by Docker to the process ID seen by Linux for the process name qemu-system-x86_64.\nBoth commands will print the same value:\n\nUnikernel VM parented to a container shim.\n\nTo verify that urunc created the qemu-system-x86_64 process inside a distinct PID namespace like in a regular container, enter the pid namespace of the unikernel container and list its processes.\n\nQEMU will be displayed with the PID 1 this time, not 23951:\n\nThe PID namespace may be largely irrelevant for the unikernel, but another namespace is crucial: the Network namespace.\n\nBefore diving into namespaces, let's take another look at the command-line parameters of the QEMU process.\nCompared to our first, manual invocation of QEMU, the one spawned by urunc has a few additional flags related to network devices:\n\nurunc also prepended the kernel command-line declared in the container image with few extra parameters, especially:\n\nThe fact that 172.17.0.2 is the same IP address as the one you sent a HTTP request to earlier is noteworthy.\n\nYou might remember the following statement from right after you printed the logs of the container:\n\nThe output is more or less identical to the one shown when you ran the unikernel via QEMU earlier.\n\nWell, a few network-related console messages actually are a novelty compared to the first, manual run of the Nginx unikernel:\n\nThose messages indicate that the unikernel recognized the network device provided by QEMU (a VirtIO device) and was able to configure a corresponding network interface.\n\nFor reference, the first, manual run only showed:\n\nHow did urunc know what command-line parameters to pass to the unikernel to configure its network stack?\n\nRemember those somewhat exotic labels set on the container image (again)?\nOne of them was:\n\nMystery solved!\n\nNow, the network device and kernel command-line parameters alone do not suffice to making the guest's Nginx web server reachable from the host.\nWhy? Because at that point the IP address 172.17.0.2 is not yet assigned to any network interface on the host.\n\nBefore a container is started, containerd calls a CNI14 plugin to set up the container's network.\nIt is during that process that the network interface(s) of the container are created and configured.\nTypically, the outcome is a pair of veth devices: one inside the root Network namespace and one inside the container's.\nThe root end gets attached to a bridge device so that network packets can be routed to the container over that bridge (docker0 on the playground box).\n\nIn certain environments, such as your playground box, containerd isn't configured to set up the network by calling a CNI plugin.\nIn that case, the Docker daemon handles the setup of the container's network itself.\n\nTake a look at the network links inside both of these namespaces:\n\nThe veth0744538 interface with the ID 8 is the root end of the veth pair.\n\nIts peer is the interface with the ID 2 (denoted by the suffix @if2) inside the container's Network namespace.\n\nThe eth0 interface with the ID 2 is the container end of the veth pair.\n\nIts peer is the interface with the ID 8 (denoted by the suffix @if8) inside the root Network namespace.\n\nIt was assigned the IP address 172.17.0.2 within the container network routed over the docker0 bridge.\n\nIn a standard setup, the container's Network namespace would only have the lo (loopback) and eth0 (veth) interfaces.\nOn the Container tab above though, you can see an additional tap0_urunc interface. What is that?\n\ntap0_urunc is a tap network device created by urunc and provided to QEMU with the command-line flag -net tap,ifname=tap0_urunc.\nThe usage of such devices is the standard way in QEMU to connect the network interface of the guest (unikernel) to a real network, such as the one of the Linux host.\n\nThis is an implementation decision of urunc, and a clever design when you think about it.\n\nCNI can configure network interfaces in a lot of different manners inside a container's network.\nA containerized Linux process can always assume that the network is usable as-is, thanks to the plumbing operated by CNI.\n\nFor an application running as a guest inside a virtual machine, this assumption falls apart and deploying a working network stack may require non-trivial configuration of both the host and guest.\n\nA container runtime such as urunc cannot possibly have differentiated logic for each CNI plugin under the sun.\nWhat it can do, however, is rely on the tap0_urunc interface to look the same in every unikernel container, then configure the network to redirect all network packets between tap0_urunc and the default interface inside the container's Network namespace (eth0).\n\nurunc implements this through traffic control, using egress redirects.\nYou can peek inside the container's Network namespace and inspect those filters:\n\nIngress filter that redirects tap0_urunc->eth0:\n\nIngress filter that redirects eth0->tap0_urunc:\n\nUnikernel guest connected to the host network via a TAP device.\n\nIn summary, the urunc container runtime managed to network the unikernel behind a regular container IP address by combining the following components and mechanisms:\n\nThat approach allows to connect practically any virtual machine to the host inside a Network namespace, making it possible to manage container and unikernel workloads using the same container infrastructure.\n\nThis tutorial is now being concluded by touching on the container configurations that can affect the settings of the unikernel virtual machine.\n\nLet's look one more time at the command-line parameters of the QEMU process:\n\nThe flag -m 268M allocates a RAM size of 268 MiB to the virtual machine's guest, even though you did not specify any resource constraint with the docker container run command.\nWhy is that?\n\nContainerized processes run inside a cgroups hierarchy that constrains their resource usage for CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.\nApplying this model to a virtual machine makes little sense because virtual machines have a distinct isolation model underpinned by virtualized hardware.\n\nurunc did in fact not place the QEMU process into a particular cgroups hierarchy, so it inherited the hierarchy of the containerd service:\n\nInstead, urunc attempted to translate the container configuration into suitable virtual machine parameters.\nBecause no memory configuration was requested, a reasonably large RAM size of 268 MiB was decided upon (QEMU's default is 128 MiB).\n\nWhen an application is deployed as a regular Linux container, the container runtime can generally make assumptions about cgroups being the preferred method for constraining the resource usage of that application, in accordance with the container's configuration.\nIn a context where the application is instead deployed as a virtual machine, the container runtime must make its own decisions in order to match the requested constraints as closely as possible.\n\nLet's see what urunc does when we explicitly set resource constraints while creating the unikernel container.\n\nTerminate the previous container to avoid future confusions:\n\nCreate another unikernel container, this time with an explicit memory constraint of 64 MiB:\n\nVerify that the new container has the expected configuration:\n\nLast but not least, ensure that the new QEMU virtual machine has 64 MiB of RAM instead of 268 MiB:\n\nThis short experiment should hopefully be a good demonstration of how parity can be achieved between various methods of constraining the resource usage of containers that differ in nature, such as unikernel VMs.\n\nIn this tutorial, you've learnt about what a unikernel is: its architecture, what it enables, but also its limitations.\n\nThrough some guided hands-on activity, you've built a web server application as a unikernel, an exercise which hopefully ignited your curiosity to explore other unikernel frameworks and experiment with them.\n\nYou've seen how some existing open source projects make it possible to integrate unikernels with a container-centric infrastructure, without having to discard the tools you are already familiar with.\n\nLevel up your Server Side game — Join 20,000 engineers who receive insightful learning materials straight to their inbox",

    "fullText": "Remember early 2025? “Vibe coding” was a meme and seemed mostly a tool for casual builders or those new to coding. It was often used disparagingly, or to imply a lack of deep technical expertise. Some very cool basic applications were being built, but AI coding assistants couldn’t reliably function in complex codebases. But what a difference a year has made!\n\nIt’s now 2026, and we find ourselves living in a new reality. Some of the most influential voices in software engineering like DHH (Ruby on Rails), Andrej Karpathy (prev OpenAI, Tesla), Tobi Lutke (Shopify), Salvatore Sanfilippo (Redis), and Mitchell Hashimoto (Ghostty, prev Hashicorp) are publicly embracing a new  paradigm: completely AI generated code controlled by human-in-the-loop prompting. It was also recently publicized that Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux and Git) is leveraging AI vibe-coding in his side-projects.\n\nAI is everywhere: if you’re a software developer, you’ve almost certainly tried at least one AI-assisted coding solution over the past year. It’s a safe assumption that a large portion of developers are using AI to help them, but we still know shockingly little about how their code was derived. This secrecy is outdated, especially now that the practice is being normalized by industry leaders.\n\nThe open source community is built on top of foundations of transparency and collaboration, of which knowledge sharing is a key component. At Mozilla.ai, we believe we must embrace and encourage the disclosure of AI usage as quickly as possible. We need to move away from “Should we AI?” and towards a structure that clearly defines our expectations for where we encourage AI usage and how we document it.\n\nIn our project any-llm, we’ve started to iterate on this philosophy by creating a pull request template that requests a few pieces of information whenever a PR is submitted.\n\nHere’s a snippet of the relevant part of our pull request template:\n\nFirst, we request that the contributors specify their level of AI usage: was AI used to draft and make edits? Or was their contribution completely AI-generated with them only directing it via plain language prompts? Both are acceptable, but it helps a reviewer understand how to approach their review. If we know the code is completely AI generated, we can be candid with our feedback and direct the contributor towards improving their prompting or AI coding configuration to improve quality. Without this transparency, it can be difficult to give feedback since a reviewer doesn’t want to offend the contributor by insinuating that their work came from a bot.\n\nSecond, we request information about the contributors' AI setup: what model(s) and IDE/CLI tools were used? This is valuable metadata for crowdsourcing best practices. Maybe there is one model or tool that works amazingly well with a certain codebase or language! Openly sharing this information allows all of us to learn from each other.\n\nLastly, we request that any responses to comments come from the contributor themselves and not their AI tool. It is frustrating to write comments without knowing if a human is on the other side reading and responding to the feedback. The open source community is a wonderful place to learn from each other, and that learning happens best when humans talk to humans. Of course, AI can be used to help the contributor brainstorm or improve their grammar, but we think the core discussion should still happen between two humans.\n\nWe welcome community opinions and hope to see similar approaches be adopted across the open source community. Let's keep learning and developing together!",

    "fullText": "Lewis Hamilton's race engineer from the 2025 Formula 1 season has been moved to a new role at Ferrari.\n\nRiccardo Adami will take over as manager of the Ferrari driver academy and their programme for testing previous cars.\n\nA Ferrari statement made no reference to Hamilton by name, saying only: \"The appointment of the new race engineer for car number 44 will be announced in due course.\"\n\nThe move comes after consistent speculation throughout the 2025 campaign there were communication problems between Hamilton and Adami.\n\nHamilton, 41, always denied that was the case and insisted their relationship was fine, despite the impression left by a number of their conversations over team radio.\n\nThe relationship with their race engineer is one of the most important for any driver.\n\nThe engineer is the person the driver talks to over the radio from the car, they decide together on changes to improve a car's performance and at times the role is as much a counsellor as colleague.\n\nBefore joining Ferrari, Hamilton worked with one engineer at Mercedes - Peter Bonnington - for all his 12 years at the team.\n\nSeven-time champion Hamilton had a difficult first season at Ferrari and spoke a number of times of his belief changes were needed within the organisation, without specifying what they were.\n\nFerrari's statement added: \"[Adami's] extensive trackside experience and Formula 1 expertise contributes to the development of future talent and to strengthening performance culture across the program.\"\n\nTesting previous cars programmes have become important within F1 as ways of giving young drivers experience, with in-season testing in current cars heavily restricted.\n\nHamilton was outperformed by team-mate Charles Leclerc during his first season at Ferrari.\n\nThe Briton finished one place and 84 points behind Leclerc in the championship and was beaten by the Monegasque 22 times to seven in qualifying at an average advantage of 0.15 seconds a lap. Leclerc's average grid position was 5.6 while Hamilton's was 9.5.\n\nHamilton was knocked out in the first session of qualifying for the final three races of the season.\n\nAt the final race of the year in Abu Dhabi there was an apparently awkward between Hamilton and Adami, when the Briton told his engineer not to inform him who was ahead of him on track.\n\nHaving been advised the car in front was Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, Hamilton responded: \"Stop telling me I'm racing people. I know I'm racing him, man. Just leave me to it. I'm racing everyone ahead of me.\"\n\nAdami previously worked with both Carlos Sainz and Sebastian Vettel - and had an at-times strained relationship with the German.\n\nThere were a number of times during the 2017-18 season, when Ferrari had a competitive car but let their title hopes slip away with a series of mistakes, when Vettel ran out of patience with the team's race operations.\n\nSainz also questioned the team's strategy choices on a number of occasions during his four years at Ferrari.",

    "fullText": "This is how you draw it up if you're someone who roots for karmic justice.\n\nA Redditor posting to the r/ConvenientCop subreddit shared dashcam footage. It shows a truck driver \"rolling coal\" only to immediately get pulled over by horseback cops (\n\nThe YouTube footage, dating back to 2012, shows that the practice is anything but new. Coal rolling is a move where drivers modify diesel trucks to send out large clouds of smoke. The targets of it are often environmentally conscious people like pedestrians, bikers, or EV drivers.\n\nIt's unclear what the exact rationale for the truck driver's rolling coal was in this case. Them having a dashcam to document themselves doing it could indicate it's a regular part of their routine.\n\nIn any case, police on horses emerged from a cloud of smoke to pull the driver over.\n\nCoal rolling involves releasing hazardous pollutants, contributing to air pollution linked to health issues such as asthma and heart disease. For that reason, U.S. law now prohibits modifying engines to increase pollution. Doing so is a violation of the Clean Air Act.\n\nIn 2023, the government filed a lawsuit against eBay alleging the site allowed the sale of devices that allowed users to disable pollution controls. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated that a \"full delete\" of emission controls could increase pollution equivalent to 300 regulated trucks\n\nWhile laws are on the books to curtail rolling coal, enforcement varies by state.\n\nThe worst outcomes are when other drivers, cyclists and pedestrians are exposed to the pollutants, threatened, or involved in an accident. Rolling coal reduces visibility and distracts the driver doing it, which happened in one such incident in Texas with six cyclists getting hit.\n\nCommenters on Reddit were baffled by the driver's actions.\n\nHow would you describe your driving style?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know who guys like this are trying to impress,\" one wrote.\n\n\"It's about trolling, not impressing,\" a commenter argued. \"Coal rollers are the type of people who just want to p*** off innocent strangers.\"\n\n\"What a waste of time and money,\" a Redditor concluded.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Portland Communications, founded by Keir Starmer’s communications chief, linked to so-called black hat edits\n\nA high-profile PR company founded by Keir Starmer’s communications chief has been accused of commissioning changes to Wikipedia pages to make them more favourable towards clients.\n\nPortland Communications, founded by Tim Allan, has been linked to the so-called black hat edits, sometimes referred to as “Wikilaundering”. Several changes were made to Wikipedia pages by a network of editors, allegedly controlled by a contractor working on Portland’s behalf.\n\nAccording to an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), Portland outsourced Wikipedia editing relating to some of its high-profile clients, including the state of Qatar.\n\nTBIJ said it had evidence of alleged Wikipedia edits made on behalf of Portland between 2016 and 2024. Between 2016 and 2021, many were made by Web3 Consulting, which is run by a consultant allegedly used by Portland to make edits.\n\nPortland was founded by Allan, a former adviser to Tony Blair, in 2001. There is no suggestion that Allan personally ordered any changes to be made or was aware of them. He sold most of his shares in the company in 2012 and left Portland in 2019. He was contacted for comment.\n\nA spokesperson for Portland said: “Portland does not have a relationship with the firm mentioned and has a policy of strict adherence to the guidelines on all social media platforms.”\n\nA Portland employee said: “If anyone who worked here in the past did this, they were foolish. For sure nobody does it today.”\n\nTBIJ said some of the alleged edits were designed to improve Qatar’s image by burying references to critical reporting before the 2022 World Cup.\n\nThe intermediary is alleged to have removed suggestions that a billion-dollar philanthropy project linked to another Portland client had failed to achieve its mission.\n\nTBIJ found other subtle changes, such as relegating unwelcome information about clients under descriptions of their philanthropic work, or swapping out critical news references to articles with something more positive.\n\nUndisclosed paid advocacy on Wikipedia, also known as “black hat” editing, violates the terms of use set out by The Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit body that supports the online encyclopedia.\n\nThe practice of institutions, states and individuals finessing their Wikipedia pages to improve their image is frowned on by the PR industry.\n\nGuidelines on the use of “dark arts” in relation to Wikipedia, written by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations (CIPR), state: “Intentional deceit and anonymous or incognito activities are breaches of professional codes of conduct.” The CIPR is a voluntary members-based association to which Portland has not signed up.\n\nThe rise of AI chatbots and summaries have made Wikipedia pages even more influential, as they are often a source for the tools.\n\nPortland has a history of making Wikipedia edits. In 2012, it was found to have made alterations on behalf of the company that produces Stella Artois, removing references on Wikipedia to an unwanted nickname, “wife beater”.\n\nAt the time, it said the changes had been made openly and within Wikipedia’s rules.\n\nHowever, former employees told TBIJ that Portland instead began to contract out edits of Wikipedia, with one telling its reporters: “No one said: ‘We should stop doing this’. The question was how we could keep doing it without getting caught.”\n\nSeveral of its sources claimed Portland commissioned a web consultant, Radek Kotlarek, whose network of accounts made Wikipedia changes. TBIJ said seven Portland insiders said Kotlarek’s services were used.\n\nKotlarek was contacted for comment, but did not respond.\n\nThe TBIJ’s investigation claimed to have identified a network of 26 accounts making edits. They were linked to Web3 Consulting, Kotlarek’s company. TBIJ said that while its sources were confidential, it had been able to corroborate their information using the public record of Wikipedia edits.\n\nAll accounts in this network that were still active in 2024 were blocked by volunteer Wikipedia editors, who investigated their activity.\n\nSix former Portland employees involved in some of the Qatar work reportedly said that Wikipedia edits were a common request. They claimed that Portland hired subcontractors to target pages related to Qatar’s human rights record, particularly around World Cup stadium-building.\n\nSome changes were performed by accounts outside the Web3 network.\n\nCompanies other than Portland also worked on major accounts such as the Qatar government’s public relations.\n\nAllan has faced controversy since becoming Downing Street’s executive director of communications at the start of September, as part of Starmer’s attempt at a government-wide reset. He retains a financial stake in another PR firm, Strand Partners, but has said he will not to take dividends or become involved in running the company while in government. He also resigned as chair on his appointment to No 10.\n\nHe has also pushed for sweeping changes to political journalists’ access to Downing Street, including scrapping one of the two daily briefings with the prime minister’s official spokesperson.\n\nIn an email last month, Allan said the changes were necessary because the media landscape had been “utterly transformed”, making existing arrangements “not fit for purpose”. The group that represents political journalists was not consulted on the plan.\n\nJournalists warned the move towards ad hoc press conferences could restrict access and scrutiny.",

    "fullText": "Moderators accuse social media firm of unfair dismissal after it fired hundreds in UK just before vote to form union\n\nTikTok moderators have accused the social media company of “oppressive and intimidating” union busting after it fired hundreds of workers in the UK, beginning the process just before they were due to vote on forming a union.\n\nThe moderators wanted to establish a collective bargaining unit to protect themselves from the personal costs of checking extreme and violent content, and have claimed TikTok is guilty of unfair dismissal and breaching trade union laws.\n\nAbout 400 moderators in London were fired before Christmas in a process initiated a week before the vote was due to take place.\n\nTikTok, which has about 30m monthly users in Britain, strongly denies a legal claim that has been lodged with an employment tribunal on behalf of three former workers, describing it as “baseless”.\n\nIt said the sackings were part of a global restructuring involving roles in the UK, and south and south-east Asia amid the increasing use of AI to automate the removal of posts that violate content rules, with 91% of transgressive content now removed automatically.\n\nBut John Chadfield, the national officer for tech workers at the Communication Workers Union, which represented about 250 of the affected moderators, said of the legal action: “This is holding TikTok to account for union busting.”\n\nHe added: “Content moderators have the most dangerous job on the internet. They are exposed to the child sex abuse material, executions, war and drug use. Their job is to make sure this content doesn’t reach TikTok’s 30 million monthly users. It is high pressure and low paid. They wanted input into their workflows and more say over how they kept the platform safe. They said they were being asked to do too much with too few resources.”\n\nA TikTok spokesperson said: “These changes were part of a wider global reorganisation, as we evolve our global operating model for trust and safety with the benefit of technological advancements to continue maximising safety for our users.”\n\nThe dispute began in August 2025, when the union had been poised to ballot several hundred of TikTok’s moderators and quality assurance agents from the trust and safety team, whose job was to vet posts for compliance with TikTok’s rules – including traumatic posts processed at high speed. TikTok announced a restructuring exercise that put members of the proposed bargaining unit at risk of redundancy, according to the legal claim.\n\nRosa Curling, a co-executive director of the tech justice non-profit Foxglove, which is backing the action, called TikTok’s treatment of its content moderators “appalling”.\n\nShe said by “laying off essential safety workers they are putting the platforms’ users at risk”, adding: “TikTok has made its position clear: union busting and trampling on our labour laws comes first – the safety of its users, including millions of children, and the wellbeing of its essential safety workers, comes last. We hope the employment tribunal will force them to change course.”\n\nAccording to TikTok, its increasing use of AI has reduced moderators’ exposure to graphic content by 76% in the past year.\n\nMichael Newman, a partner at the law firm Leigh Day, said: “This case is an important example of how individuals who band together can stand up to the might of big tech firms, and especially of how the fig leaf of AI cost savings should not be allowed to obscure vital safety concerns.”",

    "fullText": "You can find original article here Nrn. \n\nSailormen Inc., a Miami-based Popeyes franchisee with more than 130 restaurants in its portfolio, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of Florida.&nbsp;\n\nIn its filing, the company estimated it had about $130 million in debt. The company said it has “faced significant challenges” throughout the past year leading to its financial struggles, including rising operational costs due to inflation and increased borrowing expenses, higher wages, and consumer behavior changes since the pandemic that drove lower traffic.\n\nAdditionally, in late 2023, Sailormen entered into an agreement with a buyer, Tar Heels Spice, to sell 16 of its Georgia restaurants as part of a restructuring plan. That deal fell through, however, further straining the company’s finances. Sailormen stopped covering rent for the locations in April 2024 and then filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Tar Heels Spice in August 2024.&nbsp;\n\nFurther, the company’s primary lender, BMO Bank, filed a lawsuit in December for breach of contract against Sailormen related to the franchisee’s loan obligations. In that complaint, BMO is seeking a court-appointed receiver to take control of Sailormen and its assets, which was the catalyst for the Chapter 11 filing. Sailormen said its stakeholders “will fare better” because of the filing.\n\nSailormen ended 2025 with more than $233 million in sales and a net operating loss of nearly $19 million.&nbsp;\n\nThis filing comes on the heels of a relatively soft year for the chain, including -2% same-store sales in the most recently reported third quarter. Those results followed a 0.9% decline in same-store sales in Q2, and -4% in Q1.&nbsp;In 2024, however, Popeyes sales were up nearly 4%, while the company has increased its sales by nearly 20% since 2021.&nbsp;\n\nSeveral concepts have filed bankruptcy already, less than a month into 2026, illustrating a market rife with challenges such as higher cost inputs and slower consumer usage. Over the past six weeks, concepts including Pieology Pizza, Taste of Belgium, Ray Ray’s Hog Pit, and Compass Coffee have all filed for protection.&nbsp;\n\nContact Alicia Kelso at Alicia.Kelso@informa.com\n\nFollow her on TikTok: @aliciakelso",

    "description": "Scientists believe the map could shed light on how Antarctica's vast ice sheet will respond to climate change.",
    "fullText": "A new map has unmasked the landscape beneath Antarctica's ice in unprecedented detail, something scientists say could greatly enhance our understanding of the frozen white continent.\n\nResearchers used satellite data and the physics of how Antarctica's glaciers move to work out what the continent might look like beneath the ice.\n\nThey found evidence of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, and say their maps of some of Antarctica's hidden mountain ranges are clearer than ever before.\n\nWhile the maps are subject to uncertainties, the researchers believe the new details could shed light on how Antarctica will respond to climate change - and what that means for sea-level rise.\n\n\"It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on,\" lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News.\n\nThanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery.\n\nIn fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's \"underbelly\" – the topography beneath the ice sheet.\n\nBut researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made.\n\n\"I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once,\" said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. \"I think that's amazing.\"\n\nTraditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to \"see\" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks.\n\nBut these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps.\n\n“If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham.\n\nSo the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks.\n\n“It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden.\n\n“And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.”\n\nWhile we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice.\n\n\"I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there,\" said Ockenden.\n\n\"It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'.\"\n\nOne intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin.\n\nThe channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies.\n\nThe researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties.\n\nAnd much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice.\n\nBut other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward.\n\n\"This is a really useful product,\" said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping.\n\n\"It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys,\" he added.\n\nA more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say.\n\nThat is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in a warming climate.\n\nAnd that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science.\n\n“[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell.\n\nThe study is published in the academic journal, Science.\n\nAntarctic glacier's rapid retreat sparks scientific 'whodunnit'\n\nCoastlines in danger even if climate target met, scientists warn\n\n'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting\n\nScientists probe the secrets of mega icebergs\n\nWest Antarctic ice shelf melt 'unavoidable'\n\nNorwegian seafloor holds clue to Antarctic melting\n\nAccelerating melt of ice sheets now 'unmistakable'\n\n Outside the UK?",

Despite preconceptions of cavemen dining on bounties of meat, “it’s pretty obvious that the majority of what everybody was eating was vegetable matter” such as sea kale, samphire and nettles, says Dr Annie Gray, a food historian and the author of The Bookshop, the Draper, the Candlestick Maker: A History of the High Street.\n\nThis was still the case into the 19th century. The Victorians ate whatever vegetables were in season and available at their local market, or could be grown in their garden, including the now lesser-seen marrow, skirret and Japanese artichokes, she explains.\n\nNowadays, these little-known vegetables have declined in popularity and given way to the more exotic aubergine and bok choy (though potatoes, carrots, onions and peas remain the nation’s firm favourites, polls show).\n\nWhile the vegetables we eat have changed through the generations, one thing that has remained the same is their important role in our health. They enhance our immune system and maintain our bones, muscles and organs. “Five a day” is the mantra that has been drilled into us for the last two decades but the consensus is the more, the merrier. Recently, scientists have called for people to aim for 30 different varieties of plant per week (though, admittedly, this includes nuts, seeds and whole grains, as well as vegetables and fruit).\n\nDespite their vital role being clear, the number we’re buying has reached a 50-year low and meat eating has become much more common, which is only encouraged by recent high-protein and carnivore diet trends. Simultaneously, Britain has seen the return of Victorian-era diseases such as scurvy (a severe vitamin C deficiency) and rickets (caused by a lack of vitamin D and calcium), as well as rocketing hospitalisation due to malnutrition and iron deficiencies.\n\nSo, if we’re eating fewer vegetables, it’s important to make sure we’re maximising our nutritional bang for buck. While “including as many different types of vegetables in your diet is the goal”, some varieties do come up trumps, Lambert explains. Red, orange and yellow vegetables are high in vitamins A and C, while dark greens contain iron and folate but those with a high water content – cucumber, marrow and cabbage – offer fewer nutrients.\n\nHere’s her pick of the most nutritious veg.\n\nA nutritional powerhouse loaded with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytonutrients, broccoli is rich in vitamins C and K, which support immune function and bone health. It also contains sulforaphane, a potent antioxidant known for its anti-inflammatory properties which has been shown to reduce the ability of cancerous cells to multiply.\n\nAdditionally, broccoli is rich in fibre, folate and potassium, promoting heart health and aiding in digestion. The combination of these nutrients and antioxidants makes broccoli an excellent vegetable to include in your diet. Other cruciferous vegetables – cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and cabbage – are also excellent for us, though there are slight differences in their nutritional composition.\n\nEat it raw in salads or as a snack\n\nTo retain the nutrients in broccoli, steam it or eat it raw in salads or as snacks. Avoid boiling for long periods and overcooking in general. This can lead to a significant loss of water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C and folate) and antioxidants.\n\nOften considered a “superfood” due to its dense nutrient profile and high antioxidant content, kale is an excellent source of vitamins A, C and K, as well as fibre, calcium and iron. It contains powerful antioxidants such as quercetin and kaempferol, which act to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. The high levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in kale support eye health. Its impressive array of phytonutrients contributes to overall health, making it a top choice for a nutrient-dense diet.\n\nEat it raw in salads or smoothies\n\nSimilar to broccoli, to retain the nutrients in kale, lightly steam it or consume it raw in salads or smoothies. Avoid boiling for extended periods or overcooking, as these methods can reduce its vitamin content and overall nutrient density.\n\nVibrant and nutrient-dense, bell peppers are available in various colours, each offering unique health benefits. They are exceptionally high in vitamin C, vital for immune function, skin health and wound healing. Bell peppers also provide vitamins A and E, potassium and fibre. Their rich antioxidant profile, including beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, supports eye health and protects against oxidative damage, which can contribute to ageing and health problems such as heart disease. The phytonutrients in bell peppers make them a versatile and delicious addition to any diet.\n\nEat them raw in salads or as a snack\n\nLightly sauté or roast below 200C\n\nTo retain the nutrients in bell peppers, eat them raw in salads or as snacks, or lightly sauté or roast them at moderate temperatures, such as in a tray bake, below 200C, which will provide a delicious flavour. Prolonged high-temperature cooking above 200C, or boiling, can lead to a loss of water-soluble vitamins (particularly their high vitamin C content), as well as damaging the delicate phytonutrients.\n\nAn excellent source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, sweet potatoes are a top choice for nutrient density. They are particularly rich in beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A, which can help to support various vital functions such as vision, immune function and skin health.\n\nSweet potatoes also provide dietary fibre, promoting healthy digestion and stable blood sugar levels. On top of all that, they are a great source of vitamin C, manganese and potassium, all contributing to overall health. The antioxidants in sweet potatoes help combat inflammation and oxidative stress, further enhancing their nutritional value.\n\nTo retain the nutrients in sweet potatoes, bake, roast or steam them with the skin on. The skin of sweet potatoes is often what contains the majority of fibre, so keep this on for additional fibre intake. Avoid frying or boiling them for long periods, as these methods can diminish their nutrient content.\n\nRed cabbage offers an impressive number of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. It’s particularly high in vitamin C, which helps to protect cells, maintains skin health, vessels, bones and cartilage, and aids in wound healing. Red cabbage is also a great source of vitamin K, important for blood clotting and bone health, and vitamin A, which supports vision and skin health.\n\nThe deep purple colour of red cabbage is due to its high content of anthocyanins, powerful antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and may protect against chronic diseases, nutrients that you won’t find in green or white cabbage. In fact, red cabbage contains significantly more vitamin A, vitamin C and antioxidants than its green or white counterparts. Red cabbage also contains fibre, which aids in digestion and promotes a healthy gut microbiome.\n\nTo preserve the nutrients, it’s best to eat it raw in salads or lightly sauté it. Fermenting red cabbage, as in sauerkraut, is another excellent way to enhance its nutritional value, particularly by adding probiotics, making it great for your gut health. Avoid boiling for long periods, as this can lead to a significant loss of its vibrant colour and water-soluble nutrients such as vitamin C.\n\nCarrots are well known for their high beta-carotene content, which the body converts into vitamin A, supporting vision, immune function and skin health. They also provide a good amount of fibre, which promotes healthy digestion and stable blood sugar levels. Carrots contain antioxidants such as lutein and zeaxanthin, which are beneficial for eye health. The phytonutrients in carrots contribute to their vibrant colour and nutritional benefits, making them a versatile and nutritious vegetable.\n\nWhile carrots are a great snack raw, cooking them may actually “improve” their nutritional profile. This is because cooking helps to break down the cell walls, making the beta-carotene more easily absorbed and converted into vitamin A by the body. Steaming or lightly boiling carrots is optimal to preserve their nutrient content while enhancing their bioavailability. Avoid boiling for long periods and overcooking them.\n\nBeetroot is a vibrant root vegetable known for its high nutrient and antioxidant content. Rich in folate, manganese and potassium, beetroot supports heart health and overall well-being. It contains betalains, powerful phytonutrients with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Beetroot is also high in nitrates, which can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure. Its deep colour is a testament to its rich phytonutrient profile, making beetroot a valuable addition to a healthy diet.\n\nSteam or roast at moderate temperatures\n\nEat them raw in salads or juices\n\nTo retain the nutrients in beetroot, cook it by steaming or roasting at moderate temperatures, or consume it raw in salads or juices. Pickling introduces gut-friendly bacteria, though it leads to a small amount of nutrients being lost. Avoid boiling and prolonged high-temperature cooking, as these methods can lead to nutrient loss, especially of water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C, and minerals.\n\nOnions are often forgotten about when speaking of vegetables, but they are a highly nutritious and versatile ingredient, used in a wide range of dishes. They are an excellent source of vitamins C and B6, folate and potassium. Onions are rich in antioxidants, particularly quercetin, which holds antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help to lower high blood pressure and therefore reduce the risk of heart disease. Additionally, onions are rich in prebiotics, which promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and support digestive health.\n\nBoth white and red varieties are great. Red onions contain greater levels of anthocyanins than white onions, a phytochemical which has been linked to reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Meanwhile, white onions contain quercetin, which holds antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help to lower high blood pressure. The combination of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and prebiotics in onions supports immune function, heart health and overall well-being. Whether eaten raw, sautéd, roasted or caramelised, onions are a flavourful and health-boosting addition to any diet.\n\nLightly sauté or roast at a medium heat\n\nTo retain the nutrients in onions, cook them by lightly sautéing over a medium heat or roasting at moderate temperatures, or consume them raw in salads. Avoid deep-frying and prolonged high-temperature cooking, as these methods can destroy beneficial compounds. Exposing onions to a low heat over a long period of time, such as when cooked into sauces, may reduce some antioxidants but only by a very small amount and does not dramatically change their nutritional value.\n\nRich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, cauliflower is particularly high in vitamin C, which supports immune health, maintains healthy skin and protects cells. The vegetable is also a good source of vitamin K, which plays a role in bone health and blood clotting, and folate (vitamin B9), which is important for DNA synthesis and cell growth, as well as being essential during pregnancy. Like broccoli, cauliflower also contains sulforaphane, a potent antioxidant that is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and has been shown to reduce the ability of cancerous cells to multiply. Its fibre content supports digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut.\n\nSteam or roast at moderate temperatures\n\nTo retain the nutrients in cauliflower, steaming or roasting it at moderate temperatures is ideal. Avoid boiling for long periods, as this can lead to nutrient loss, particularly of water-soluble vitamins, and can result in a less desirable texture. Cauliflower can also be used as a low-carb substitute for grains, such as in cauliflower rice or pizza crust, which is particularly useful for people with diabetes, who require lower glycemic index (GI) foods.\n\nMushrooms are particularly high in B vitamins (such as riboflavin, niacin and pantothenic acid), which can support energy production and brain health, as well as selenium, potassium and copper. Selenium is a key mineral needed to support the immune system. Mushrooms are one of the few non-animal sources of vitamin D when exposed to sunlight; however, if mushrooms haven’t been exposed to UV light or direct sunlight, they are unlikely to contain high levels of vitamin D2. It’s also important to note that the type of vitamin D found in mushrooms (D2) is less bioavailable than D3, which is found in animal products or algae. However, mushrooms also contain immune-modulating nutrients such as beta-glucan, which can support the body’s ability to fight infections. Mushrooms also contain several prebiotic strains which can promote a healthy gut microbiome.\n\nLightly sauté, grill or roast or roast at a medium heat\n\nMushrooms can be sautéd, grilled, roasted or added to soups and stews. To increase their levels of vitamin D, leave them in direct sunlight for 15-20 minutes before cooking. Avoid overcooking to preserve their nutrient content.\n\nA nutrient-dense vegetable, asparagus is particularly high in folate (vitamin B9), which is crucial for DNA synthesis and cell growth. It’s also a good source of vitamins A, C, E and K, which together can support immune function, skin health, cell health and bone health. Asparagus is rich in antioxidants such as glutathione, which can help to combat free radicals, molecules that can damage your body’s cells. Asparagus also contains fibre, which can help in digestion and promote a healthy gut microbiome.\n\nTo preserve the delicate nutrients in asparagus, it’s best to steam, grill, or roast it lightly. Avoid overcooking or boiling for extended periods, as this can lead to a loss of vitamins and a less appealing texture.\n\nPeas are a highly nutritious legume, packed with vitamins, minerals and plant-based protein. They are an excellent source of vitamins A, C, and K, which support immune function and overall cellular health and contribute to the body’s ability to repair tissues. They also contain B vitamins, particularly thiamine and niacin, which aid in energy metabolism and support the health of nerves and muscles.\n\nThey are also a great source of minerals such as magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Additionally, peas contain phytonutrients such as carotenoids and flavonoids that help protect the body against oxidative stress and inflammation. The soluble fibre in peas helps regulate cholesterol levels, particularly LDL cholesterol, and supports digestive health by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. With their high fibre and significant plant-based protein content, peas contribute to a feeling of fullness and are a valuable plant-based source of iron, essential for red blood cell production and efficient oxygen transport throughout the body.\n\nTo retain bright colour and nutrients in peas, lightly steam or sauté them. Avoid boiling for long periods, as this can lead to a loss of water-soluble vitamins and a mushy texture.\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy of lettuce varieties is romaine, due to its greater nutritional value. It is rich in essential vitamins including A, C, K and folate, as well as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium. Its darker green leaves indicate a higher concentration of beneficial antioxidants and phytonutrients that can support eye health and help protect against degenerative eye conditions. Despite being lower in energy and fibre compared with some leafy greens, romaine lettuce still provides significant nutritional benefits. Its high water content also aids in hydration, and its mild flavour makes it a versatile ingredient in salads and sandwiches, enhancing the overall nutritional profile of meals.\n\nRomaine lettuce is best consumed raw to preserve its nutrient content. Avoid cooking lettuce, as heat can cause it to wilt and lose its nutrient content, especially its water-soluble vitamins and delicate antioxidants.\n\nGreen beans are a good source of vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin C, vitamin K, folate and manganese. Manganese supports metabolism, bone health and wound healing. Green beans are also a source of fibre, which supports digestion and helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome. Green beans also contain polyphenols such as flavonoids, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. While not as nutrient-dense as some other vegetables, they are still a healthy and versatile addition to meals, offering a balance of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients.\n\nBlanch in boiling water and plunge in cold water\n\nGreen beans are best when lightly steamed or sautéd, preserving their texture and nutrients. Blanching them briefly in boiling water and then plunging them into ice water can also retain their colour and nutrients. Avoid overcooking.\n\nThey are a staple vegetable to many for a reason. Potatoes provide a good source of vitamins C, pyridoxine, niacin and folate, as well as potassium, manganese, magnesium and phosphorus. They are versatile and can be prepared in a variety of ways, making them a popular choice in many diets. They contain fibre, even more so when consumed with the skin on. However, their high GI means they can cause a rapid spike in blood glucose, making them less ideal for those managing blood sugar levels, such as people who have diabetes. Despite this, potatoes offer valuable nutrients and are a good source of energy because of their high carbohydrate content, at a relatively low cost, meaning they are a staple to many people’s diets.\n\nBake, roast or steam them with the skin on\n\nTo maximise the nutritional benefits of potatoes, bake, roast or steam them with the skin on. This helps preserve their fibre and nutrient content. Avoid deep-frying (such as chips), as this introduces unhealthy fats and significantly increases the calorie content and may take away from their nutritional value.\n\nSweet corn can be a great addition to your diet as it contains important nutrients such as vitamin C and folate, which are important for overall cellular health. It is also a great source of the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which are known to promote and protect eye health. While sweet corn generally contains more sugar than most other vegetables, it is also a great source of fibre. Regardless of its sugar content, the fibre present in sweet corn makes it a low GI food as fibre prevents the rapid blood sugar spikes that are seen in high-GI foods. Reasoning for its lower ranking simply comes down to the fact that it isn’t as nutrient-dense as other vegetables; however, sweet corn can still be a part of a very healthy, balanced diet.\n\nTo retain the nutrients in sweet corn, it’s best to steam or grill it. Avoid boiling sweet corn for long periods, as this can lead to a loss of water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C. Light cooking methods help maintain its sweet flavour and nutrient profile. When looking to buy tinned sweet corn, try to opt for those lower in added sugar or salt.\n\nCelery is often overlooked because of its high water content and is therefore thought of as a vegetable that doesn’t do much for you in terms of nutrition. Yet it is low in calories and provides vitamins C and K, potassium and folate. Celery contains antioxidants such as flavonoids and vitamin C, which help protect cells from damage. Its high water content aids in hydration, and the fibre it provides supports digestion. While not as nutrient-dense as some other vegetables, celery is rich in phytonutrients with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it worthy of inclusion in a balanced diet.\n\nEat it raw in salads or as a snack\n\nSimilar to the other vegetables, it is recommended to consume celery raw in salads or as a snack, or lightly steam it, and to avoid boiling or prolonged cooking, as these methods can cause a loss of water-soluble nutrients.\n\nThese two vegetables are great to include in your diet as they still provide small amounts of nutrients and fibre. But, overall, they’re not as beneficial as other veg.\n\nCucumber is a refreshing vegetable with a very high (96 per cent) water content, making it hydrating but relatively low in nutrients. While it does provide some nutrients such as B vitamins, vitamins C and K, copper, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium, it lacks the nutrient density of many other vegetables.\n\nCucumbers contain some antioxidants, such as flavonoids, which may help reduce inflammation and protect against oxidative stress. The skin of cucumbers also contains fibre, which supports digestion and promotes a healthy gut microbiome, but overall they are not as nutrient-rich as other options such as leafy greens or cruciferous vegetables.\n\nEat it raw in salads or as a snack\n\nCucumbers are best consumed raw to maximise their hydration and nutrient content. They are perfect for salads, sandwiches, or as a refreshing snack. For added fibre and nutrients, leave the skin on.\n\nIceberg lettuce is ranked at the bottom because of its low nutrient density compared with other lettuce and leaf varieties. It provides very small amounts of essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins A, C, and K, and is lower in fibre and antioxidants than its darker-leafed counterparts. The light green, almost white colour of iceberg lettuce indicates a lower concentration of phytonutrients and beneficial compounds. While it contributes to hydration due to its high water content (approximately 96 per cent), its nutritional benefits are limited compared with more nutrient-dense greens such as romaine or cos lettuce.\n\nLike romaine, iceberg lettuce isn’t often cooked or exposed to heat. It is best used raw in the likes of salads, sandwiches and other fresh dishes to provide a crisp texture. Avoid cooking lettuce, as heat can cause it to wilt and lose its nutrient content, especially its water-soluble vitamins and delicate antioxidants.\n\nThough we need them only in tiny doses, vitamins are key for keeping our bodies working properly. They bolster our immune system, strengthen our bones and keep our skin healthy. Our bodies can’t make them, so we need to get them from our diet.\n\n“Vegetables are major sources of the essential vitamins, particularly vitamins A, C, K, folate and E,” explains Dr Maria Traka, the head of food and nutrition at the Quadram Institute. For example, vitamin A helps us see things in dim light, while vitamin K helps blood clot together so wounds can heal.\n\nUnfortunately, popping a multivitamin isn’t necessarily a quick fix if you’re not eating enough vegetables. “Obtaining nutrients from whole foods maximises nutrient absorption and minimises the risk of over-intake,” which can be toxic, she explains. Over long periods, very high doses of vitamin A can weaken our bones, too much vitamin D can damage the kidneys and heart, and excessive amounts of iron can be fatal.\n\n“Additionally, vegetables contain other beneficial components such as polyphenols, carotenoids and phytochemicals,” which aren’t present in supplements, Dr Traka notes. “Studies suggest these reduce the risk of many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, degenerative eye diseases and osteoporosis.”\n\nFibre is a carbohydrate that’s found in plants. “It acts to push other materials through the intestines so promotes regular bowel movements, improves gut motility and can relieve constipation,” Dr Traka explains.\n\nIt helps fill us up, which can help prevent overeating and weight gain, improves our blood sugar control, so can protect against Type 2 diabetes, and feeds our gut microbiome, so is beneficial for our gut health, she notes. Fibre has also been shown to protect against inflammation, cardiovascular disease and bowel cancer, Dr Traka adds.\n\nPer 100g, peas (6g), sweet potato (4g), Brussels sprouts (3.9g) and broccoli (2.6g) are among the most fibre-rich vegetables.\n\nHearty, high-carbohydrate vegetables are often demonised for being higher in calories than leafy greens and salad vegetables. However, potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips and sweet corn are still nutritious. They are starchy foods that are full of fibre and vitamins.\n\n“They offer unique benefits that lower-carb vegetables may not provide,” explains Dr Traka. “They provide a quick and sustained source of energy. The fibre content in these vegetables promotes satiety, aids in weight management and helps regulate digestion and blood sugar levels.”\n\nFresh vegetables are, of course, packed with nutrients, but frozen can be just as nutritious or, in some cases, superior.\n\nFor example, studies suggest frozen kale contains more antioxidants, while frozen broccoli has more B vitamins. This is because vegetables are frozen at their peak, which locks in their high nutritional value. However, frozen vegetables can lose some vitamins during cooking, as they release more water during cooking.\n\nThe picture is mixed in relation to tinned. “Some water-soluble vitamins such as B vitamins and vitamin C can be lost in the canning process or leach into the surrounding liquid,” Dr Traka explains. “Additionally, check the label and choose tinned vegetables that haven’t got added salt or sugar.”\n\nWhen it comes to cooking, root vegetables drizzled with honey and roasted in the oven for an hour are obviously delicious. Unfortunately, minimal cooking is generally better, as it prevents nutrients from being lost, explains Dr Traka.\n\n“Lightly steamed is better than boiled, as boiling vegetables in a lot of water causes B vitamins and vitamin C to escape into the water,” she says. When frying or roasting, avoid dousing vegetables in oil or butter as it adds unnecessary calories, she says.\n\nAccording to government guidelines, we should be aiming for five portions (around 80g) of different vegetables per day.\n\nThe most nutrient-dense green vegetables are dark, leafy greens like kale, spinach, Swiss chard, and collard greens. Broccoli is also a brilliant green vegetable.\n\nYes, there is a negligible difference between nutrients in fresh and canned vegetables. Both are healthy.\n\nThe Science of Plant-Based Nutrition by Rhiannon Lambert is out now\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves",
    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves ​of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.\n\nKyiv, one of Eastern ‌Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.\n\nKlitschko said the current energy crisis ‌was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity,\" Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview ⁠in his office at the heart of ‌Kyiv.\n\nSome Kyiv residents face up to 18 to 20 hours a day without mains electricity. Ukraine declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles due to accumulated wartime ‍damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.\n\nBitter cold weather with icy rain and snow exacerbated the challenges. Nighttime minimum temperatures have dipped to around -17 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) in Kyiv this week.\n\nFAST REPAIRS, GENERATORS AND INTERNATIONAL AID\n\nKlitschko said Ukraine's international partners had ​rushed in additional generators, and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian ‌strike last week that knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings.\n\nAbout 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.\n\n\"We're not just working during the day now, we're working at night too,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as the start and end of the working day for us.\"\n\nIn addition to repairs and generators, the city opened about 1,300 sites with heaters to help residents keep warm, and was working to install mini thermal power stations in ⁠some districts to decentralize electricity and heating.\n\nWith generators, the priority was ​to provide electricity to ensure water supplies and power hospitals, kindergartens, ​and other key critical infrastructure, Klitschko said. About 300 tonnes of fuel a day were needed to do that.\n\nKlitschko reiterated his call for Kyiv residents to leave the city if they ‍have the opportunity to do ⁠so to ease the pressure on its infrastructure.\n\nSchools in Kyiv extended their winter holidays, and many commercial companies have switched to remote work arrangements.\n\nKlitschko said that despite all the challenges, city officials were determined to ⁠restore heating supplies in full, and they were also planning for backup scenarios in case new Russian air strikes damage the energy infrastructure.\n\n\"This ‌winter will be difficult, but we are doing everything that's possible and impossible,\" Klitschko said.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Olena Harmash; editing by Daniel Flynn and Alex Richardson)",

Your weekly roundup of offbeat stories from around the world.\n\nIn one of the most improbable match-ups since David smote Goliath, a miniature deer appeared to get the better of a fully grown rhino in a head-to-head at a Polish zoo.\n\nA video of the tiny muntjac stag facing down the 1.7-tonne rhino -- and seemingly winning -- broke the internet.\n\n\"Someone probably forgot to look in the mirror this morning,\" Wroclaw zoo joked on its Facebook page after the deer got territorial with a thick-skinned neighbour nearly 120 times his size.\n\nAt first the female rhino called Maruska appeared amused by the deer's cheek at taking her on.\n\nBut by the end of the clip, the muntjac was chasing her around the enclosure they share.\n\nDespite muntjacs being \"very territorial\", the two species get along well and have lived happily together for years, zookeeper Maciej Okupnik told local media.\n\n\"This time, Daddy deer got a little carried away by his hormones,\" he added, with the zoo praising the way the female rhino dealt with his hilariously delusional machismo.\n\nA Malian witch doctor was arrested after making nearly $39,000 for promising that the west African country would win the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThe man, a former political activist, who \"made a fortune\" after proclaiming himself a marabout (faith healer) overnight, was saved by the police when an angry mob turned up at his house after The Eagles were beaten 1-0 in the quarter finals by neighbours Senegal.\n\nHe was later held for fraud by the cybercrime division in the capital, Bamako.\n\nBelief in faith healers and fortune tellers is common across the region but \"charlatanism is punishable by law in Mali\", a division official told AFP.\n\nIt pays to get straight to the point in China.\n\nA new alert app called \"Are You Dead?\" for people who live alone quickly became the most downloaded in the country.\n\nMore and more people in China are living alone as marriage rates fall and the number of elderly empty-nesters grow.\n\nThe app's blunt name and ghost icon clearly did not put them off. \"Are You Dead?\" sends an email to an emergency contact if you don't check in every two days.\n\nBut it was too much for IT worker Yaya Song. \"If I wanted my grandparents to download this app, I probably wouldn't be able to bring myself to say the name,\" she said.\n\nAnd she was not alone. With the name making headlines across the world, the app's makers decided to ditch the catchy moniker for the duller \"Demumu\" for its next release.\n\nThe famously laidback Hollywood star Matthew McConaughey is trying to patent his voice and image to protect himself from AI, including his famous catchphrase \"all right, all right, all right\" from the iconic slacker movie \"Dazed and Confused\".\n\nSo unauthorised use of his Texan drawl will soon be officially no longer cool, man.",

    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital.",
    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the U.S. controlling Greenland, a message that came as a bipartisan Congressional delegation sought to lower tensions in the Danish capital.\n\nTrump for months has insisted that the U.S. should control Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in U.S. hands would be “unacceptable.”\n\nDuring an unrelated event at the White House about rural health care, he recounted Friday how he had threatened European allies with tariffs on pharmaceuticals.\n\n“I may do that for Greenland too,” Trump said. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security. So I may do that,” he said.\n\nHe had not previously mentioned using tariffs to try to force the issue.\n\nEarlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThat encounter didn’t resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group — on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views.\n\nEuropean leaders have insisted that is only for Denmark and Greenland to decide on matters concerning the territory, and Denmark said this week that it was increasing its military presence in Greenland in cooperation with allies.\n\nA relationship that ‘we need to nurture’\n\nIn Copenhagen, a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives met Friday with Danish and Greenlandic lawmakers, and with leaders including Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.\n\nDelegation leader Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, thanked the group’s hosts for “225 years of being a good and trusted ally and partner” and said that “we had a strong and robust dialogue about how we extend that into the future.”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said after meeting lawmakers that the visit reflected a strong relationship over decades and “it is one that we need to nurture.” She told reporters that “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset, and I think that’s what you’re hearing with this delegation.”\n\nThe tone contrasted with that emanating from the White House. Trump has sought to justify his calls for a U.S. takeover by repeatedly claiming that China and Russia have their own designs on Greenland, which holds vast untapped reserves of critical minerals. The White House hasn’t ruled out taking the territory by force.\n\n“We have heard so many lies, to be honest and so much exaggeration on the threats towards Greenland,” said Aaja Chemnitz, a Greenlandic politician and member of the Danish parliament who took part in Friday’s meetings. “And mostly, I would say the threats that we’re seeing right now is from the U.S. side.”\n\nMurkowski emphasized the role of Congress in spending and in conveying messages from constituents.\n\n“I think it is important to underscore that when you ask the American people whether or not they think it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, the vast majority, some 75%, will say, we do not think that that is a good idea,” she said.\n\nAlong with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, Murkowski has introduced bipartisan legislation that would prohibit the use of U.S. Defense or State department funds to annex or take control of Greenland or the sovereign territory of any NATO member state without that ally’s consent or authorization from the North Atlantic Council.\n\nInuit council criticizes White House statements\n\nThe dispute is looming large in the lives of Greenlanders. Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said on Tuesday that “if we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.””\n\nThe chair of the Nuuk, Greenland-based Inuit Circumpolar Council, which represents around 180,000 Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia’s Chukotka region on international issues, said persistent statements from the White House that the U.S. must own Greenland offer “a clear picture of how the US administration views the people of Greenland, how the U.S. administration views Indigenous peoples, and peoples that are few in numbers.”\n\nSara Olsvig told The Associated Press in Nuuk that the issue is “how one of the biggest powers in the world views other peoples that are less powerful than them. And that really is concerning.”\n\nIndigenous Inuit in Greenland do not want to be colonized again, she said.\n\nSuperville reported from Washington. Emma Burrows in Nuuk, Greenland and Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",

    "description": "The fight in Ukraine changes so rapidly that weapons makers can't afford to constantly overhaul and redevelop whole systems.",
    "fullText": "The battlefield in Ukraine is changing constantly, and weapons makers are rushing to keep up.\n\nDrone and ground robot makers said they're designing their systems in ways that allow them to be easily updated.\n\nThey're either modular, meaning parts can be swapped out, or designed so software changes are all that's needed.\n\nRapid changes on the battlefield in Ukraine are prompting Western weapons manufacturers to reassess how military technology is developed and upgraded.\n\nWith the fight evolving quickly, arms companies in Ukraine and Europe say that they can't afford to start from scratch and completely redesign entire systems each time conditions shift.\n\nInstead, companies making aerial drones and ground robots told Business Insider that their focus is now on creating weapons that can be upgraded by simply changing parts or software rather than overhauling the whole system.\n\nDesigns are modular, like Lego pieces, with parts being easily swapped out as new mission demands arise. Increasingly, companies are turning to software-first designs for more convenient upgrades.\n\nDefense technology has been moving in this direction, but revelations from Russia's war against Ukraine are injecting new urgency.\n\nPatrick Shepherd, the chief sales officer for Milrem Robotics, an Estonian company that makes autonomous uncrewed ground vehicles and has some in Ukraine, said that these changes are key to staying ahead, as they provide much faster adaptation than what \"traditional, monolithic designs\" permit.\n\nUkraine's soldiers say that battlefield tech can become out of date in weeks and months, with electronic warfare, new drone countermeasures, and new tactics blunting once-effective systems.\n\nAmong the companies involved in this evolving technology battle is DroneShield, an Australian company that develops counter-drone technology and operates across Europe. It has multimillion-dollar US military contracts and has multiple systems in Ukraine.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of DroneShield's US arm, said that the drone and counter-drone fight has sped up globally since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, cutting development cycles to weeks rather than months or years.\n\nThe only way to keep pace, he said, is to build \"systems that are not fixed, solving the problem of today, but ones that can address an issue today and adapt as needed.\"\n\nLithuanian drone company Granta Autonomy was one of the first companies to send drones to Ukraine. CEO Gediminas Guoba said the company needs to build systems that are not simply ready for this year or the next, but can be updated and upgraded for new operations even further into the future.\n\nThat means building systems that can be easily reworked. Anything else, he said, and \"we will lose the battle.\"\n\nMcCrann said the faster development cycle is why DroneShield has put greater emphasis on modular and adaptable designs.\n\nLikewise, Shepherd said that Milrem builds flexibility into its systems from the outset, allowing sensors, payloads, mission systems, and other components to be integrated, removed, or upgraded without redesigning the entire vehicle.\n\nAchi, the CEO of Ukraine's Ark Robotics, which makes autonomous robots used by nearly two dozen Ukrainian brigades, said the company focuses on making its platforms \"as cheap and as mass producible as possible.\" He spoke to Business Insider using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\n\"And then when we get this right, we can do surface-level customization,\" like adding armor or additional equipment. The base platform remains the same, letting the company scale production without driving up costs.\n\nLatvia-based Origin Robotics manufactures both drones and drone interceptors used by Ukrainian and NATO forces. Its CEO, Agris Kipurs, told BI that the company also prioritizes modular systems to adapt quickly to battlefield changes.\n\nModular designs aren't just for companies striving to keep their edge in a competitive industry. Warfighters need them too. Ukrainian soldiers have said they need flexible systems that can be easily modified at the front.\n\nOleksandr Yabchanka, the head of robotic systems for Ukraine's Da Vinci Wolves Battalion, previously told Business Insider that the ground robots his unit uses can be configured for different missions, be it evacuating wounded troops or attacking Russian positions. He said the robots work like Lego bricks.\n\nShepherd said that Milrem's robots follow the same logic, avoiding designs built around a single mission. They can be customized by soldiers for evacuation, explosive disposal, intelligence gathering, or weaponized roles.\n\nIn some cases, soldiers adapt systems in ways manufacturers did not anticipate.\n\nWestern companies say they are learning from those changes. McCrann said Ukraine has been technologically innovative \"because they have to be,\" and that this is driving industry adaptation.\n\nCompanies sometimes have group chats and FaceTime calls with Ukrainian soldiers to get real-time feedback, and weapons software is where they can make the biggest changes the fastest.\n\nShepherd said that software is now playing a central role in adapting systems, whether for command-and-control integration or mission management. \"Software updates can be developed, tested, and deployed much more quickly, allowing lessons learned from the field to be integrated on shorter timescales,\" he said.\n\nMcCrann said DroneShield has focused on a software-first approach, where upgrades add new capabilities without hardware modifications.\n\nGuoba said Granta Autonomy's drones have not changed much over the last year or two, but the software inside them, on the other hand, \"is changing every month.\"\n\nSoftware can be remotely pushed to weaponry already in Ukraine, eliminating the need to ship gear back to the factory. That speed, and the ability to test changes quickly, has made software the preferred tool for rapid adaptation.\n\nUltimately, Ark Robotics' Achi said, \"software is easier to do.\"\n\nArk's aerial drones and ground robots rely on onboard and server-based software, and the company is developing systems to allow thousands of platforms to operate together with minimal human involvement.\n\nHe said Ark also deploys engineers forward to implement software changes tailored to specific units or missions. It follows a similar approach for hardware, though those changes take longer to implement.\n\nKipurs said Origin makes its systems \"software-intensive\" so development is continuous, \"with updates regularly pushed to improve systems that have already been delivered.\"\n\nIt only uses hardware changes \"when they provide clear benefits across all intended users.\" Because the company also builds for NATO customers, systems must remain broadly interoperable.\n\nShepherd said companies still need to strike a balance. Systems must remain reliable, so not every update can be rushed to the field. The key, he said, is close collaboration with Ukrainian soldiers and fast but disciplined feedback loops.",

    "title": "Scientists May Have Found the Blueprint of the Human Body at the Bottom of the Ocean",
    "description": "Scientists discovered that the brainless sea anemone build their bodies with a technique common in bilaterians... which is what humans are.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nOne major division of the kingdom Animalia is Cnidarians (animals built around a central point) and bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry), which includes us humans.\n\nA study found that the sea anemone, a member of the Cnidarian phylum, uses bilaterian-like techniques to form its body.\n\nThis suggests that these techniques likely evolved before these two phyla separated evolutionarily some 600 to 700 million years ago, though it can't be ruled out that these techniques evolved independently.\n\nMake a list of complex animals as distantly related to humans as possible, and sea anemones would likely be near the top of the list. Of course, one lives in the water and the other doesn’t, but the differences are more biologically fundamental than that—sea anemones don’t even have brains.\n\nSo it’s surprising that this species in the phylum Cnidarians (along with jellyfish, corals, and other sea creatures) contains an ancient blueprint for bilaterians, of which Homo sapiens are a card-carrying member.\n\nA study by a team of scientists at the University of Vienne discovered that sea anemones, whose Cnidarian status means they grow radially around a central point (after all, what is the “face” of a jellyfish), use a technique commonly associated with bilaterians, known as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) shuttling, to build their bodies. This complicates the picture of exactly when this technique evolved or if it possibly evolved independently of bilaterians. The results of the study were published last year in the journal Science Advances.\n\n“Not all Bilateria use Chordin-mediated BMP shuttling, for example, frogs do, but fish don’t, however, shuttling seems to pop up over and over again in very distantly related animals making it a good candidate for an ancestral patterning mechanism,” University of Vienna’s David Mörsdorf, a lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “The fact that not only bilaterians but also sea anemones use shuttling to shape their body axes, tells us that this mechanism is incredibly ancient.”\n\nTo put it simply, BMPs are a kind of molecular messenger that signals to embryonic cells where they are in the body and what kind of tissue they should form. Local inhibition from an inhibitor named Chordin (which can also act as a shuttle) along with BMP shuttling creates gradients of BMP in the body. When these levels are their lowest, for example, the body knows to form the central nervous system. Moderate levels signal kidney development, and maximum levels signal the formation of the skin of the belly. This is how bilaterians form the body’s layout from back to body.\n\nMörsdorf and his colleagues found that Chordin also acts as a BMP shuttle—just as displayed in bilaterians like flies and frogs. Thi signals that this particular evolutionary trait likely developed before Cnidarians and bilaterians diverged. Seeing as these two phylums of the animal kingdom have vastly different biological structures, that divergence occurred long ago, likely 600 to 700 million years ago.\n\n“We might never be able to exclude the possibility that bilaterians and bilaterally symmetric cnidarians evolved their bilateral body plans independently,” University of Vienna’s Grigory Genikhovich, a senior author of the study, said in a press statement. “However, if the last common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria was a bilaterally symmetric animal, chances are that it used Chordin to shuttle BMPs to make its back-to-belly axis.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "HAVANA (AP) — Trumpets and drums played solemnly at Havana's airport Thursday as white-gloved Cuban soldiers marched out of a plane carrying urns with remains of the 32 Cuban officers killed during a stunning U.S. attack on Venezuela.\n\nNearby, thousands of Cubans lined one of Havana’s most iconic streets to await the bodies as the island remained under threat by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nThe soldiers' shoes clacked as they marched stiff-legged into the headquarters of the Ministry of the Armed Forces and placed the urns on a long table next to the pictures of those killed. Tens of thousands of people paid their respects, saluting the urns or holding their hand over their heart, many of them drenched from standing outside in a heavy downpour.\n\nThursday’s mass funeral was only one of a handful that the Cuban government has organized over the past half-century.\n\nThe soldiers were part of the security detail of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro during the Jan. 3 raid on his residence to seize the former leader and bring him to the U.S. to face drug trafficking charges.\n\nState television also showed images of what it said were more than a dozen wounded combatants from the raid, accompanied by Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez after arriving Wednesday night from Venezuela. A man identified in state media as Col. Pedro Yadín Domínguez attended Thursday's ceremony in a wheelchair.\n\nHe said it was a “disproportionate attack” that killed 11 colleagues around him as they slept. Yadín said he was committed to doing “whatever it takes to defend this people and to remain united in the face of threats from the United States.”\n\nTensions between Cuba and the U.S. have spiked, with Trump recently demanding that the Caribbean country make a deal with him before it is “too late.” He did not explain what kind of deal.\n\nTrump also has said that Cuba will no longer live off Venezuela's money and oil. Experts warn that the abrupt end of oil shipments could be catastrophic for Cuba, which is already struggling with serious blackouts and a crumbling power grid.\n\nOfficials unfurled a massive flag at Havana's airport as President Miguel Díaz-Canel, clad in military garb, stood silent next to former President Raúl Castro, with what appeared to be the relatives of those killed looking on nearby.\n\nCuban Interior Minister Lázaro Alberto Álvarez Casas called the slain soldiers “heroes” of an anti-imperialist struggle spanning both Cuba and Venezuela. In an apparent reference to the U.S., he said the “enemy” speaks of “high-precision operations, of troops, of elites, of supremacy.\n\n“We, on the other hand, speak of faces, of families who have lost a father, a son, a husband, a brother,” Álvarez said.\n\nThe events demonstrate that “imperialism may possess more sophisticated weapons; it may have immense material wealth; it may buy the minds of the wavering; but there is one thing it will never be able to buy: the dignity of the Cuban people,” he said.\n\nCarmen Gómez, a 58-year-old industrial designer, was among the thousands of Cubans who lined a street where motorcycles and military vehicles thundered by with the remains of those killed.\n\n“They are people willing to defend their principles and values, and we must pay tribute to them,” Gómez said. “It’s because of the sense of patriotism that Cubans have, and that will always unite us.”\n\nThe 32 military personnel ranged in age from 26 to 60 and were part of protection agreements between the two countries.\n\nOfficials in Cuba have said they expect a massive demonstration Friday across from the U.S. Embassy to protest the deaths.\n\n“People are upset and hurt ... many do believe that the dead are martyrs” of a historic struggle against the United States, analyst and former diplomat Carlos Alzugaray told The Associated Press.\n\nThe first mass funeral in decades\n\nIn October 1976, then-President Fidel Castro led a massive demonstration to bid farewell to the 73 people killed in the bombing of a civilian flight financed by anti-revolutionary leaders in the U.S. Most of the victims were Cuban athletes.\n\nIn December 1989, officials organized a ceremony to honor the more than 2,000 Cuban combatants who died in Angola during Cuba’s participation in a war that defeated the South African army.\n\nIn October 1997, memorial services were held following the arrival of the remains of guerrilla commander Ernesto “Che” Guevara and six of his comrades, who died in 1967.\n\nThe latest mass burial is critical to honor those slain, said José Luis Piñeiro, a 60-year-old doctor who lived for four years in Venezuela.\n\n“I don’t think Trump is crazy enough to come and enter a country like this, ours, and if he does, he’s going to have to take an aspirin or some painkiller to avoid the headache he’s going to get,” Piñeiro said. “These were 32 heroes who fought him. Can you imagine an entire nation? He’s going to lose.”\n\nCuba riled by US aid for hurricane recovery\n\nThe remains arrived a day after the U.S. announced $3 million in additional aid to help the island recover from the catastrophic Hurricane Melissa. The first flight took off on Wednesday, and a second flight was scheduled for Friday. A commercial vessel also will deliver food and other supplies.\n\nCuba had said on Wednesday that any contributions will be channeled through the government.\n\nBut U.S. State Department foreign assistance official Jeremy Lewin said Thursday that the U.S. was working with Cuba’s Catholic Church to distribute aid, as part of Washington's efforts to give assistance directly to the Cuban people.\n\n“There’s nothing political about cans of tuna and rice and beans and pasta,” he said Thursday, warning that the Cuban government should not intervene or divert supplies. “We will be watching, and we will hold them accountable.”\n\nLewin said the Cuban government has a choice to: “Step down or better provide towards people.” Lewin added that “if there was no regime,” the U.S. would provide “billions and billions of dollars” in assistance, as well as investment and development: “That’s what lies on the other side of the regime for the Cuban people.”\n\nRodríguez, the Cuban foreign minister, said the U.S. government was “exploiting what appears to be a humanitarian gesture for opportunistic and politically manipulative purposes.”\n\nCoto contributed from San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

    "description": "A heavily modified 1969 Chevrolet Corvette Pro Street convertible with supercharged V8 power is newly listed for sale.",
    "fullText": "A modified 1969 Chevrolet Corvette Convertible built in Pro Street style has entered the market with an asking price of $61,995, offering a dramatic interpretation of one of Chevrolet’s most recognizable performance cars. The listing presents the vehicle as a new arrival, emphasizing its aggressive mechanical configuration and classic open-top Corvette design.\n\nFinished in Brilliant Red metallic, the two-door convertible retains the familiar lines of the 1969 Corvette while incorporating substantial performance-focused upgrades. Power comes from a supercharged 406-cubic-inch V8 running on gasoline, paired with a four-speed manual transmission. The combination positions the car firmly in the Pro Street category, blending classic muscle car aesthetics with drag-inspired performance hardware.\n\nThe Corvette shows 59,390 miles on the odometer. While the listing does not specify how many of those miles were accumulated before or after modification, the overall presentation centers on performance rather than originality. Four-wheel disc brakes are included, supporting the car’s high-output setup and aligning with the Pro Street theme of enhanced stopping capability to match increased power.\n\nInside, the Corvette features a black interior with vinyl upholstery. Bucket seats with a center console are fitted, and the manual shifter is console-mounted, maintaining a traditional sports car layout. The interior configuration reflects a balance between stripped-down performance intent and recognizable Corvette comfort cues.\n\nThe vehicle is offered with financing options listed at $627 per month, along with additional services that may include vehicle protection plans, insurance assistance, and transportation to the buyer’s location. These options suggest the seller is positioning the car for enthusiasts seeking a turnkey, high-impact classic rather than a restoration project.\n\nThe 1969 model year remains a standout in Corvette history, marking the final year before major styling changes arrived in the early 1970s. Convertible versions from this era continue to attract attention, particularly when paired with extensive performance modifications that push them beyond factory specifications.\n\nWhile full details are still pending, the listing highlights the Corvette’s supercharged V8, manual transmission, and Pro Street character as defining features. As presented, this 1969 Corvette Convertible offers a bold, unapologetic take on classic American performance, aimed squarely at buyers drawn to visual impact and raw mechanical presence rather than factory-correct preservation.\n\n⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious",

    "description": "An Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s violent crackdown on protests.  Members of the National Army of Kurdistan, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed,” Jwansher Rafati, a PAK representative, told The Associated Press on Thursday.",
    "fullText": "IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — An Iranian Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s violent crackdown on protests.\n\nMembers of the National Army of Kurdistan, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed,” Jwansher Rafati, a PAK representative, told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nIranian media has previously accused the group and other Kurdish factions of attacking security forces.\n\nIranian activists say more than 2,797 people were killed in the government’s crackdown on a recent wave of nationwide protests.\n\nA handful of Iranian Kurdish dissident or separatist groups — some with armed wings — have long found a safe haven in northern Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region, where their presence has been a point of friction between the central government in Baghdad and Tehran.\n\nIran has occasionally launched strikes on the groups’ sites in Iraq but has not done so since the outbreak of the recent protests.\n\nThe PAK is the first of the groups to claim armed operations since the protests and crackdown began.\n\n“When we found out that the IRGC was shooting protesters directly, our fighters in Ilam, Kermanshah, and Firuzkuh responded with armed operations and inflicted significant damage on the regime’s forces,” Rafati said in an interview in Irbil, the capital of northern Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region.\n\nThe PAK has also claimed a number of attacks online and posted video of what it said were operations against IRGC targets, sometimes accompanied by grainy videos showing gunshots or explosions and buildings ablaze. The AP was not able to confirm the extent of the damages or the impact of the attacks.\n\nRafati said the attacks were launched by members of the group’s National Army of Kurdistan military wing based inside Iran. The group had not sent any forces from Iraq, but it anticipates that Iran may strike PAK bases in Iraq in retaliation for its operations, he added.\n\nHe said the PAK has been providing support to dozens of Iranians who fled to the Kurdish area in Iraq since the crackdown on protests began.\n\nThe PAK claims may put Iraqi authorities in a sensitive situation with Tehran — which wields significant influence over its neighbor — concerning the group's ongoing presence in northern Iraq.\n\nIraq in 2023 reached an agreement with Iran to disarm Kurdish Iranian dissident groups and move them from their bases near the border areas into camps designated by Baghdad. The bases were shut down and movement within Iraq was restricted, but the groups have remained active.\n\nDuring the Israel-Iran war last year, the PAK and other Kurdish dissident groups began organizing politically in case the authorities in Tehran should lose their hold on power but did not launch armed operations.\n\nA PAK spokesperson told the AP at the time that premature armed mobilization could endanger the Kurdish groups and the fragile security of Kurdish areas, both in Iraq and across the border in Iran.\n\nA decade ago, PAK forces received training from the U.S. military when they were taking part in the fight against the Islamic State militant group after it swept across Iraq and Syria, seizing large swathes of territory.\n\nIronically, the PAK at the time found itself allied with Iran-backed Shiite Iraqi militias that were also fighting against IS.\n\nAt that time, the PAK received funding from Iraq's Kurdish regional government, but says now that most of its funding comes from its supporters in Iran and the diaspora.\n\nDuring the recent protests, Iranian state media has repeatedly referred to the demonstrators as “terrorists” and alleged they received support from America and Israel, without offering evidence to support the claim.\n\nIranian state television aired what appeared to be surveillance video of a group of men wearing the baggy pants common among the Kurds, firing pistols, in Iran’s western Kurdish region. It has also published images of seized weapons in the area.\n\nThe semiofficial Tasnim news agency, which is close to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, said Kurdish groups including the PAK “have played an active role in inciting these movements by issuing coordinated statements and messages.” It said that “groups based in northern Iraq have passed the stage of psychological warfare and media operations and have entered the field phase.”\n\nThe semiofficial Fars news agency, which is also close to the Revolutionary Guard, reported on Jan. 10 that another group — the Kurdistan Free Life Party, or PJAK — had killed eight Guard members in Kermanshah and that a PJAK sniper killed a police officer in Ilam province. PJAK has not claimed any armed operations during the protests.",

    "description": "According to internal emails editorial doubts were raised before publication, with some journalists questioning not only the thinness of the sourcing.",
    "fullText": "New leaked emails have revealed the “huge internal concern” in the CBS newsroom over whether the network should push anonymously sourced claims about the injuries reportedly suffered by the ICE officer who shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis.\n\nThe exclusive report, which was first published on X and then expanded into an article, claimed that the agent, Jonathan Ross, “suffered internal bleeding to the torso.” The claim, attributed to “two U.S. officials”, however, raised immediate skepticism in the newsroom, according to Guardian reporter Jeremy Barr.\n\nAccording to internal emails seen by Barr, editorial doubts were raised before publication with some journalists questioning not only the thinness of the sourcing but the political implications of amplifying the unverified medical claim, given the incendiary nature of the incident.\n\nIn one email, a medical producer suggested clarifying the extent of Ross’s injuries, writing: “It would be helpful to ask what type of treatment he received.”\n\n“I’m no doctor, but internal bleeding is a very broad term and can range in severity,” CBS News senior vice-president David Reiter wrote.\n\nHe added: “A bruise is internal bleeding. But it can also be something serious. We do know that the ICE agent walked away from the incident – we have that on camera.”\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, one staffer said the report was viewed as “a thinly-veiled, anonymous leak by [the Trump administration] to someone who’d carry it online.”\n\nAnother added: “Felt to many here like we were carrying water for the admin’s justifying of the shooting to keep our access to our sources.”\n\nThose staffers reportedly told the newspaper that the network editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, showed strong interest in the story during an editorial call.\n\nCBS defended its reporting, saying it followed “its rigorous editorial process” while other outlets, including ABC News, NBC News and The New York Times went on to echo the reporting. Fox News cited the Department of Homeland Security in its report, while conceding key details remained unclear.\n\nThe post Leaked Emails Show ‘Concern’ in CBS Newsroom Over ICE Agent ‘Internal Bleeding’ Exclusive: Report first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Analysts debate whether Bitcoin will follow gold's scarcity-driven surge or take a more volatile path due to structural market differences.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin's exchange-traded funds could be following the exact structural playbook that preceded gold's historic 2025 surge, a parallel that suggests a potential parabolic move awaits the top cryptocurrency.\n\nThe analogy was highlighted by Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matthew Hougan on a podcast with influencer Michael 'Threadguy' Jerome.\n\n\"That’s the same thing that’s happening in Bitcoin,\" Hougan said, pointing to the transformation in gold after central banks began \"panic buying\" following the 2022 Ukraine war sanctions.\n\nCentral bank demand for gold jumped from 400 tons to over 1,000 tons annually starting in 2022. That relentless buying absorbed supply for years before igniting a price explosion: gold closed 2022 down, rallied 13% in 2023, 27% in 2024, and then surged nearly 65% in 2025.\n\n“Eventually, what gold tells you is that sellers run out of ammo. And that’s when the price goes parabolic,” the analyst said.\n\nHe sees the same pattern in Bitcoin ETFs, which have consistently bought more than 100% of the new supply since launch. “So I do think gold has shown what’s going to happen... we’re going to get to that parabolic blowoff move if that buy-side demand continues.”\n\nThis “gold-first, Bitcoin-follows” pattern has been observed before, as highlighted in a previous Decrypt report, where Lawrence Lepard, co-founder of Equity Management Associates, noted “Gold often moves first, and then Bitcoin follows and outperforms.\"\n\nFurthermore, following gold's major rallies, \"a swift rebound shouldn't be the base case,\" Ryan McMillin, chief investment officer at Merkle Tree Capital, previously told Decrypt, suggesting any follow-on move may require patience.\n\nBitcoin Google Searches Hit 11-Month Low as Gold Continues to Climb\n\nOther analysts agree with the high-level premise—that sustained buying absorbs selling pressure—but caution that Bitcoin’s path will have its own distinct volatility and drivers.\n\nTim Sun, senior researcher at HashKey Group, partially agreed with McMillin’s views. \"At a high level, the fact that sustained structural buying absorbs market selling pressure is indeed a core characteristic of any supply-scarce asset entering a long-term bull market,\" he told Decrypt.\n\nHowever, Sun highlighted critical distinctions in market structure.\n\nGold, Silver Hit New Highs as Bitcoin Trades Flat Ahead of Key Macroeconomic Events\n\nFor gold, buyers are typically central banks and sovereign wealth funds seeking a \"hedge against fiat currency credibility,\" resulting in low-leverage, long-term capital. Bitcoin ETF buyers, while institutional, still treat it as a risk asset, leading to \"far higher\" embedded leverage and trading activity.",

    "description": "Carhartt CEO Lisa Hubbard weighs on the essential worker shortage in the US.",
    "fullText": "Carhartt, the 137-year-old workwear maker, depends on workers in factories and mechanic shops to buy their hoodies and jackets.\n\nThe decline of blue-collar jobs presents a problem for the Detroit-based seller.\n\n\"Jobs in the skilled trades, technical workers are really undervalued jobs in our country right now and difficult to access,\" Carhartt CEO Linda Hubbard said on Yahoo Finance's Market Catalysts (video above). Hubbard, a trained accountant who has been with the family-owned Carhartt since 2002, landed the top job in 2024.\n\nCarhartt has teamed up with fellow Detroit company Ford (F) to address the issue. The companies — founded a mile apart — announced this week a multiyear strategic partnership that includes a new Ford Super Duty Carhartt-themed truck in 2027, apparel that supports the skilled trades, and workforce development and community building.\n\nIt's a natural extension of the longtime relationship: Carhartt outfitted Ford factory workers from the 1920s through the 1970s.\n\n\"Part of our mission, of course, is to make great gear to serve and protect the people that are doing these really difficult jobs,\" Hubbard said. \"But also part of our mission is to continue to help them in different ways. And some of that is to just show there's opportunity out there for new people interested in the trades.\"\n\nIt's a tie-up that's vital at this juncture in the US economy.\n\nThe essential economy, as Ford CEO Jim Farley coined it in recent months, comprises critical industries like construction, utilities, freight and delivery, agriculture, transportation, oil and gas, energy, first responders, and equipment manufacturing.\n\nThese industries account for $12 trillion of gross domestic product, 95 million jobs, and 3 million businesses.\n\nThis area of the economy continues to experience labor shortages as older workers age out and Gen Z views jobs such as loading trains as too demanding. Meanwhile, some existing workers lack the skills experts say are necessary to stay current as AI technology becomes embedded throughout the supply chain.\n\nAccording to a survey by PRT Staffing, 17.4% of companies in manufacturing report worker shortages. The problem may get worse before it gets better, even as Ford and others invest in expanding the talent pool. PRT projects the need to fill 3.8 million manufacturing jobs over the next decade.\n\nLast September, Ford announced workforce development investments totaling more than $5 million through 2026. The money will flow into 15 Ford Future Builders Labs in Michigan and Tennessee to bring hands-on learning to K-12 students. The company added that it will partner with SkillsUSA to expand advanced manufacturing and automotive programs for high school students.",

    "fullText": "The news was a firehose of stories of authoritarian behavior. We can’t let ourselves drown.\n\nAfew months ago, when my editors asked me to try my hand at a new “Authoritarian Watch” column in the new year, part of me worried that some weeks I would struggle to find material. After all, surely even the Trump administration would slow down; surely, not all their actions would be authoritarian.\n\nTurns out I needn’t have worried.\n\nTake Venezuela, or, more accurately, take Venezuela’s leader and spirit him away to a jail in Brooklyn and then take Venezuela’s oil and sell it on the open market. Who will determine how the profit is divvied up? “Me,” Trumps said, in a rare moment of honesty.\n\nOr take Greenland, or more accurately, well… “take Greenland.” Because, as Trump so piquantly puts it, “Ownership is very important.” He went on to tell his New York Times interviewers that “that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success.” This is a 21st-century version of the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes’s hubristic claim, “I would annex the planets if I could; I often think of that. It makes me sad to see them so clear and yet so far.” (Well, Elon Musk is set on colonizing space and realizing Rhodes’s dream.)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is increasingly set on creating his own Lebensraum here on planet earth. While Hitler sought living space for his German Volk, Trump seeks to secure resource space: access to unlimited oil via Venezuela, access to rare earth minerals via Greenland, and access to pliant markets across Latin America and the Caribbean. All of this is backed by a pledge to vastly increase US military spending (last week he posted on social media that he needed a 50 percent increase in military spending over the next year)—thus putting the entire economy and country on a permanent war footing. And he may indeed need the military after declaring that the entire Western Hemisphere now exists solely to pleasure and enrich the United States. He calls this grotesque philosophy by the anodyne name of the “Donroe Doctrine.”\n\n“In foreign policy, he has discovered he can do whatever the hell he wants,” Steven Levitsky, Harvard professor of government and director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, said of Trump’s new doctrine. “There are no constraints. This should be terrifying for anyone who believes in the international order.”\n\nIn the blink of a sleepy Trump eye, the world has regressed from a purportedly postcolonial era to a most avowedly colonial one. And, as the US presents itself to the world in full colonial finery, Stephen Miller, Trump’s ghoulish immigration enforcer and now foreign policy guru, has said that Europe’s great powers were wrong to have ditched their empires and even more wrong to then have allowed those brown and Black ex-colonials to migrate to the First World and “reverse colonize” them.\n\nOne can almost see Miller, in khakis and a pith helmet, guarded by Pete Hegseth and his vandal hordes, slashing his way through the jungle while quoting Rudyard Kipling—or, since 21st-century American colonialists seem somewhat less poetically inclined than the old British empire builders, belting out some skinhead anthem as he subdues the natives.\n\nMiller’s white nationalism is infecting every aspect of the US government. Recently, the head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission posted a video requesting that white males who had suffered job discrimination contact the government to see if they could file a claim for racial or sexual discrimination. Because, of course, if one looks at the vast history of discrimination in the United States, it is white males who have been treated most unfairly. That now seems to be the Trump administration’s official view. After all, Trump recently noted that the outcome of the civil rights movement was that “white people were very badly treated” and that the country embraced “reverse discrimination.”\n\nAfter ICE agents murdered Renée Good in Minneapolis, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem spouted a slew of lies about Good from a podium emblazoned with the logo “One of ours, all of yours.” In other words, “Dare to fuck with us as we implement our government-sponsored pogrom against Somalis and other non-white residents in Minneapolis, and we will come after all of you.”\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Dani McClain\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Joan Walsh\n\nStories have emerged in recent weeks that in DHS’s $100 million effort to enlist 10,000 additional ICE agents, recruiters are targeting gun shows, UFC Fight Nights, and other far-right hangouts; and in these efforts, they’re using what critics have labeled a neo-Nazi song, “We’ll have our home again.” The department has also published Uncle Sam recruitment posters emblazoned with the words: “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.”\n\nIt’s hard to look at all of this and not think of the fascist paramilitaries and nativist propaganda machines led by men such as Hitler, Franco, Mussolini, and Pinochet. And if you don’t want to take my word for it, take Joe Rogan’s. The podcaster, whose support for Trump was instrumental in his 2024 election win, is now describing ICE as a “Gestapo” agency.\n\nReports out of Minneapolis have detailed ICE agents’ repeatedly invoking the killing of Good, essentially warning protesters that what befell Good will befall them if they continue to oppose the government’s pogroms. That’s not law enforcement; that’s terrorism with a federal uniform. And, to make this threat a reality, Trump is threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act, allowing him to deploy heavily armed military personnel to Minneapolis.\n\nIn 2025, the administration all but ended the country’s refugee resettlement program, letting in only right-wing white Afrikaners from South Africa. In 2026, Trump has upped the ante still further, announcing this week a ban on immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries. Look at the list, which encompasses roughly a third of the countries on earth, and almost all them are predominantly non-white, majority non-Christian, or, in the case of countries like Colombia and Brazil, led by presidents who have had the temerity to challenge Trump.\n\nIn normal times, such an extraordinary—and illegal—action as upending US immigration policy without any input from Congress would dominate the news; this week, so deep has the country sunk into Christian white nationalist mire and so acclimatized have we become to Trump ruling by fiat rather than by legislation, it merited barely a mention.\n\nSo, too, the FBI’s being sicced on Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson got buried under the avalanche of other examples of authoritarianism. Agents raided her home this week to search for files she had compiled while reporting stories on fired federal workers. And while the stunning news that Federal Reserve chair was facing a clearly politically motivated investigation into spending decisions surrounding the renovation of the Reserve’s DC headquarters did create ripples, by midweek it, too, had largely been lost amid the other authoritarian clutter.\n\n“I said in February I thought we were in a constitutional crisis,” outgoing New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, whose term concludes on January 20, told me this week. From the president on down, he explained, members of the administration are repeatedly “thumbing their noses at the rule of law.”\n\nPlatkin—who says that in private many Republican state attorneys general agree with his criticisms but are too scared to go public with their concerns—explained that he remained hopeful that lower courts would continue to push back against Trump’s excesses and that ultimately an aroused public would evict these lawbreakers from the halls of power. “This is not who we are as a nation,” he said. “We cannot accept a scenario where federal law enforcement officers operating for a rogue agency with no training can kill US citizens with impunity.”\n\nPlatkin is scathing in his observations about Trump cabinet members who are enabling the slide to full authoritarian governance. “They’re acting like laws don’t apply to them, and that’s just not true. Trump’s shown us how fragile our system is. And unless people see there’s a cost to doing this, it will happen again.”",

    "description": "Andrea...",
    "fullText": "Formed to oppose the Iraq War, Madres Contra La Guerra have now spent decades trying to end Puerto Rico’s role at the center of the US war machine in Latin America.\n\nIn a blurry black-and-white Polaroid from 1971, Sonia Santiago Hernández reenacts an image of the Madonna and Child. Only 21 years old, she wears a miniskirt and sandals, and oversize sunglasses sit perched on her forehead. She stands in contrapposto outside the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras in San Juan, gazing serenely at her newborn son Gabriel. Since his birth, Gabriel had been her companion at every Vietnam War protest that she attended, shuffling between student comrades who took turns holding him. In the months before her pregnancy, Santiago had been on hunger strike for 26 days.\n\nOn a colonized island where one-third of all Puerto Rican women had been forcefully sterilized from the 1930s to the ’70s, holding the baby for a photo felt like an act of resistance. Gabriel was raised in a house plastered with peace-sign magnets, pins, posters, and stickers—his playpen devoid of toy guns or weapons.\n\n“Maternity is life,” Santiago told me. “War is death. We fight for peace.”\n\nIn 2003, the United States invaded Iraq, and Puerto Rico became overrun with military recruiters. Lurking in malls, colleges, and other youth haunts, they promised financial benefits and opportunity for those who enlisted. More than 38,000 Boricua youth were deployed—including Gabriel.\n\nSantiago’s grief and devastation at her son’s involvement in US war led her to found Madres Contra La Guerra, or Mothers Against War, in May 2003. When the United States attacked Venezuela and abducted Nicolás Maduro on January 3, killing 80 people in the process, Santiago saw Iraq’s history repeating itself. She found herself ridden by the same indignation. “Once again, they are trying to justify their aggression under the rhetoric of narcotrafficking, falsely attributing the origin of drugs in the region to Venezuela,” Santiago said in a Madres’ press release, recalling the threat of weapons of mass destruction that convinced her son to enlist in Iraq. “This is a fabricated narrative designed to cover up a war of plunder.”\n\nAfter waking up to the news in Caracas, Madres coordinated a protest with the Venezuelan Solidarity Network outside of the federal building in San Juan. Their message, beyond an end to the escalation, was directed at Puerto Rican youth soldiers: Don’t become accomplices to the war on Venezuela.\n\nThe attacks of January 3 did not surprise Santiago and other Puerto Ricans, who over the last several months had seen military training exercises take over their public beaches. Since the United States sank the first Venezuelan ship in early September, the supposedly dormant Roosevelt Roads naval base in Ceiba came back to life. The last few months brought the largest military ramp up in the Caribbean since the 1994 invasion of Haiti. Ceibeños often hear the deafening noise of the fighter jets. Their silverware trembles and their lamps shake as F-35s, V-22 Ospreys, and UH-60 Black Hawks roar overhead. Some 15,000 US soldiers have been garrisoned at the base.\n\nLong before the US started its war games with Venezuela, Puerto Rico had operated as the linchpin of the US invasions in the region. In 1954, US militia invaded Guatemala from the Ramey Base in Aguadilla as part of a coup against President Jacobo Arbenz, whose agrarian reform threatened the profits of the United Fruit Company. In 1965, US troops trained in Roosevelt Roads were sent to the Dominican Republic following the overthrow of Juan Bosch. In 1983, Puerto Rico served as a staging ground for the US invasion of Grenada, and again for the 1989 invasion of Panama. Maduro’s first stop on his way out of Venezuela was through Aguadilla. In the now-viral image of Maduro in a gray Nike Tech jumpsuit, he clutches a Nikini water bottle, a brand sold in Puerto Rico.\n\nSantiago notes that the invasions that preceded the attacks on Venezuela were also a reflection—not of “manifest destiny” but of US economic and geopolitical interests. “They are using this invasion to guarantee forced access to their resources, the oil and natural resources that belong to the Venezuelan people.” Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, which will now trade exclusively with the United States.\n\nWhat began as an anti-recruitment group advocating for conscientious objection to the Iraq War became an organization devoted to peaceful civil disobedience. Since its inception, the group’s protests have shut down the entry points of prominent recruitment centers and military bases. Madres’ coalition of 200 families formed part of a broad anti-military resistance in Puerto Rico, which, in addition to protesting the Iraq War, was trying to push the US military out of Vieques.\n\nVieques is a tiny appendage off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico that housed the Vieques Naval Training Range, the construction of which displaced 10,000 Viequenses. The US military used the base to perform countless experiments with toxic weapons, including agent orange, napalm, white phosphorus, and heavy metals. In 1999, a bombing accident killed a local security guard, David Sanes Rodriguez. That year, activist and Independence Party president Rubén Berríos began a year-long civil sit-in at the navy’s high-impact zone, sparking a wave of fierce opposition. A few years later, Vieques closed; along with it, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base, once one of the largest bases in the world.\n\nThe media often uses the word “remilitarization” to describe the situation in Puerto Rico.Santiago rejects that characterization. “It’s not ‘remilitarization’; it’s reactivation,” she said. “They’re doing the same thing they always did. They were just passive for a while. But they never left.”\n\nThe “passive” period that Santiago mentions was filled with broken promises. When the military shuttered Vieques, it promised a cleanup, but thousands of acres remain contaminated. Cancer rates are 30 percent higher in Vieques than on the rest of the island. Fort Allen, Camp Santiago, and Fort Buchanan never closed. Nor did the Muñiz Air National Guard Base in Carolina, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spouted made-up propaganda about a fictional Venezuelan drug cartel.\n\nImmediately following the January 3 attacks on Venezuela, the US military held “Army of the Caribbean Week ’26” at Fort Buchanan. It is the first event of its kind, and it involved deploying thousands of troops and beefing up military equipment for a week of training in a “commitment to duty and readiness in the Caribbean.” Press releases about Army Week are vague, intentionally distanced from Venezuela, but Trump warned that he could target Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico next. If that happens, it’s more than likely that Puerto Rico will again be the staging ground.\n\nThe strikes on Venezuelan ships came from Roosevelt Roads, and it led Madres Contra La Guerra to block the entry to the base for the first time in 20 years. Now 67, Santiago leads a group of mothers, elders, and youth in a bus en route to Ceiba. She wears red lipstick and a black peace-sign T-shirt that reads, “War is the Antithesis of Life.” Over the clamor of helicopters, the Madres chant, “Basta ya, basta ya, No a guerra criminal”—“Stop it now, Stop it now, No to criminal wars”—to the percussive rhythms of bomba (ironically and unrelatedly, Spanish for “bomb”). Accompanying the protesters is a group of drummers, Tambores Por Palestina.\n\nA central tenet of the Madres’ philosophy is solidarity with other colonized countries and mothers. It began with Iraq and has now extended toPalestine and Venezuela. Every Tuesday since October 2023, Madres can be found wearing keffiyehs outside the Israeli consulate in San Juan leading the islands’ most prominent anti-genocide protests. Their visibility has earned Madres multiple visits from the FBI. Yet they remain unflinchingly vocal about the shared colonial struggle of Palestine and Puerto Rico, swinging both flags in communion.\n\nSimilarly, Madres often refer to Venezuela as a “sister country.” “We understand that Venezuela, like every Latin American country, is being accosted by US imperialist interests,” Santiago said. “But beyond that, there’s an enormous cultural and linguistic affinity between us, a shared history of liberation struggles.” Santiago references Simón Bolívar in Venezuela and Ramón Emeterio Betances in Puerto Rico, whose cries for independence reverberate through present decolonial movements across the island.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nFeature\n\n /\n\n Dani McClain\n\nA significant element of Madres activism is fighting for restitution for the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the agreement that handed over Puerto Rico, Cuba, Philippines, Hawaii, and Guam to the United States after the Spanish-American War and made them de facto military colonies. Santiago sees the treaty as the origins of Puerto Rico as a colonial war laboratory. “It’s important to emphasize it, denounce it, and demand reparations. They need to return those lands on a national level,” Santiago said. “Those aren’t Roosevelt’s roads, those are the roads of my people, the Ceibeños. They steal land and then name it after themselves. It’s not right.”\n\nSantiago still speaks of motherhood with reverence and affection. She claims it is the undercurrent of her solidarity and her struggle for peace. “When you create life, you’re not thinking that you will raise them to kill or be killed,” she said, evoking her son Gabriel, now a veteran who struggles with PTSD. “That thread of maternity can be extrapolated not only onto your child, but for all of humanity.”\n\nHer words echo the sentiments of “militant mother” movements across Latin America—Madres de la Plaza de Mayo in Argentina and Madres Buscadoras in Mexico. Santiago and some of her peers have travelled to Argentina. They’ve broken bread with mothers in Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador and accompanied them in their grief and sense of political possibility. Santiago maintains that the maternity knows no border.\n\nThere’s anger, frustration, and indignation embedded in mothers’ movements like Madres Contra la Guerra. Yet Santiago stressed revolutionary kindness above all. “Maternity is derived from tenderness and love. Solidarity is tenderness between communities,” she explained, recalling Venezuela, Palestine, and her own children. “It’s really simple. It’s philosophical, yes, but it’s actually the simplest feeling there is.”",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran returned to uneasy calm after a wave of protests that drew a bloody crackdown, a senior hard-line cleric called Friday for the death penalty for detained demonstrators and directly threatened U.S. President Donald Trump — evidence of the rage gripping authorities in the Islamic Republic.\n\nHarsh repression that has left several thousand people dead appears to have succeeded in stifling demonstrations that began Dec. 28 over Iran’s ailing economy and morphed into protests directly challenging the country’s theocracy.\n\nThere have been no signs of protests for days in Tehran, where shopping and street life have returned to outward normality, though a week-old internet blackout continued. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the death toll, at 2,797. The number continues to rise.\n\nIran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi urged the U.S. to make good on its pledge to intervene, calling Trump “a man of his word.”\n\nAyatollah Ahmad Khatami's sermon, carried by Iranian state radio, sparked chants from those gathered for prayers, including: “Armed hypocrites should be put to death!” Executions, as well as the killing of peaceful protesters, are two of the red lines laid down by Trump for possible military action against Iran.\n\nKhatami, a member of Iran's Assembly of Experts and Guardian Council long known for his hard-line views, described the protesters as the “butlers” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “Trump’s soldiers.” He insisted their plans “imagined disintegrating the country.”\n\n“They should wait for hard revenge from the system,” Khatami said of Netanyahu and Trump. “Americans and Zionists should not expect peace.”\n\nHis fiery speech came as allies of Iran and the United States alike sought to defuse tensions. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israel's Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nPeskov said “the situation in the region is quite tense, and the president is continuing his efforts to help de-escalate it.”\n\nRussia had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Moscow has watched several key allies suffer blows as its resources and focus are consumed by its 4-year-old war against Ukraine, including the downfall of Syria’s former President Bashar Assad in 2024, last year’s U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran and the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro this month.\n\nExiled Iranian royal calls for fight to continue\n\nDays after Trump pledged “help is on its way” for the protesters, both the demonstrations and the prospect of imminent U.S. retaliation appeared to have receded. One diplomat told The Associated Press that top officials from Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Qatar had raised concerns with Trump that a U.S. military intervention would shake the global economy and destabilize an already volatile region.\n\nYet the Trump administration has warned it will act if Iran executes detained protesters. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes the president's promise of assistance.\n\n“I believe the president is a man of his word,\" Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. He added that \"regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice to carry on the fight.“\n\nDespite support by diehard monarchists in the diaspora, Pahlavi has struggled to gain wider appeal within Iran. But that has not stopped him from presenting himself as the transitional leader of Iran if the regime were to fall.\n\nIran and the U.S. traded angry accusations Thursday at a session of the United Nations Security Council, with U.S. ambassador Mike Waltz saying that Trump “has made it clear that all options are on the table to stop the slaughter.”\n\nGholam Hossein Darzi, the deputy Iranian ambassador to the U.N., blasted the U.S. for what he said was American “direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran to violence.”\n\nIran authorities list protest damage\n\nKhatami, the hard-line cleric, also provided the first overall statistics on damage from the protests, claiming 350 mosques, 126 prayer halls and 20 other holy places had sustained damage. Another 80 homes of Friday prayer leaders — an important position within Iran's theocracy — were also damaged, likely underlining the anger demonstrators felt toward symbols of the government.\n\nHe said 400 hospitals, 106 ambulance, 71 fire department vehicles and another 50 emergency vehicles also sustained damage.\n\nEven as protests appeared to have been smothered inside Iran, thousands of exiled Iranians and their supporters have taken to the streets in cities across Europe to shout out their rage at the government of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAmid the continuing internet shutdown, some Iranians crossed borders to communicate with the outside world. At a border crossing in Turkey’s eastern province of Van, a trickle of Iranians crossing Friday said they were traveling to get around the communications blackout.\n\n“I will go back to Iran after they open the internet,” said a traveler who gave only his first name, Mehdi, out of security concerns.\n\nAlso crossing the border were some Turkish citizens escaping the unrest in Iran.\n\nMehmet Önder, 47, was in Tehran for his textiles business when the protests erupted. He said laid low in his hotel until it was shut for security reasons, then stayed with one of his customers until he was able to return to Turkey.\n\nAlthough he did not venture into the streets, Önder said he heard heavy gunfire.\n\n“I understand guns, because I served in the military in the southeast of Turkey,” he said. “The guns they were firing were not simple weapons. They were machine-guns.”\n\nIn a sign of the conflict’s potential to spill over borders, a Kurdish separatist group in Iraq said it has launched attacks on Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in recent days in retaliation for Tehran’s crackdown on protests.\n\nA representative of the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, said its members have “played a role in the protests through both financial support and armed operations to defend protesters when needed.” The group said the attacks were launched by members of its military wing based inside Iran.\n\nThe death toll of at least 2,797, provided by the Human Rights Activists News Agency, exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the 1979 revolution.\n\nThe agency has been accurate throughout years of demonstrations, relying on a network of activists inside Iran that confirms all reported fatalities. The AP has been unable to independently confirm the toll. Iran's government has not provided casualty figures.\n\nAmiri reported from New York. Associated Press journalist Serra Yedikardes contributed to this story from Kapikoy Border Crossing, Turkey.",

    "description": "Ground-penetrating radar detects artificial structures at Turkey's alleged Noah's Ark site, revealing corridors and chambers matching biblical dimensions.",
    "fullText": "Ground-penetrating radar has detected what researchers describe as artificial internal structures at Turkey’s Durupınar Formation—the boat-shaped geological feature that’s sparked decades of Noah’s Ark speculation. The findings include a 13-foot central corridor, layered interiors suggesting three decks, and internal voids reaching six meters deep, matching biblical dimensions with unsettling precision.\n\nModern scanning technology reveals unexpected subsurface features at the controversial Turkish site.\n\nYou know that feeling when your phone’s ultrasound app reveals something unexpected behind a wall? That’s essentially what happened here, but with military-grade ground-penetrating radar. Noah’s Ark Scans, working with Turkish universities, found sharp-angled walls and systematic internal chambers where geologists expected solid rock formation.\n\nThe technology works like underground X-ray vision, bouncing electromagnetic waves off buried structures to create detailed subsurface maps. These aren’t the fuzzy blobs you’d expect from natural geological processes—the radar detected angular structures and organized patterns that suggest human construction.\n\nLaboratory analysis reveals elevated organic matter and chemical signatures consistent with decomposed wood.\n\nSoil samples from 22 locations show something intriguing: potassium levels and organic matter double that of surrounding areas, plus pH changes throughout the formation’s interior. “If this was a wooden vessel, we would expect increased potassium levels and higher organic content—and that’s exactly what we find,” explains soil scientist William Crabtree.\n\nEven the grass above appears discolored, suggesting whatever’s below continues affecting surface conditions thousands of years later. The chemical signature extends throughout the boat-shaped formation, creating a subsurface fingerprint that matches what decomposed timber would leave behind.\n\nRecent ceramic discoveries align with traditional Noah flood chronology estimates.\n\nConstruction crews recently uncovered pottery fragments dating 5,000-7,000 years old near the site—perfectly matching the Chalcolithic period when biblical chronologists place the flood narrative. Dr. Faruk Kaya from Agri Ibrahim Cecen University calls this evidence of early human activity in an area that should have been uninhabited if purely geological.\n\nThe timing couldn’t be more precise for believers: these artifacts place human civilization at the exact location during the window when ancient texts describe the great flood.\n\nGeologists maintain the formation results from ordinary mudflow and erosion processes.\n\nNot everyone’s convinced by the digital treasure hunt. Geologists like Lorence Collins classify Durupınar as natural limonite formation created by mudflow and erosion. Early 1960s excavations found only soil and rocks, while critics note the site sits in a valley—contradicting Genesis 8:4’s description of the ark landing on “mountains of Ararat.”\n\nThe debate continues as Turkish authorities plan core drilling that could definitively settle whether faith and science converge at this windswept Turkish hillside.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "fullText": "Formula 1’s financial strength continues to rise, with four of the sport’s biggest names appearing in Sportico’s 2026 list of the world’s 100 highest-paid athletes.\n\nThe figures show how the championship’s global growth has helped its stars rival football, basketball, and golf’s biggest earners.\n\nThe rankings reflect athlete income during 2025, combining race salaries, prize money, and commercial endorsements. With sponsorship deals expanding and more fans engaging across new markets, Formula 1 has become one of the most lucrative sports in the world.\n\nLewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen both placed inside the top 15, while Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri also featured in the top 100. Together, the four drivers earned over $280 million during the year.\n\nSportico’s latest report confirmed that four current Formula 1 drivers ranked among the highest-earning athletes in 2025.

    "fullText": "Two meets into the season, ninth-ranked UCLA gymnastics has set an unforgiving standard for execution. They know their routines must be virtually perfect in order to avoid reductions from the judges.\n\n“That’s really where our mindset is at,” UCLA coach Janelle McDonald said. “We want to continue to learn and grow from the things that we’ve already experienced and really put in the work to be the best team that we’re capable of being.”\n\nAs they prepare to face Nebraska in their home opener at Pauley Pavilion on Saturday, McDonald said the Bruins are focusing on the small details within their routines and landings. Facing some of the nation's top teams during a quad meet in Utah last week — where UCLA finished third behind defending national champion Oklahoma and No. 2 Louisiana State — set the tone for what is expected to be a challenging season for the Bruins.\n\n“None of us are locked in how we want to be,” McDonald said. “It’s a really good test early in the season to have great competition across the board at a meet but also to be able to kind of see where you’re at and where we need to continue to build, too.”\n\nIf the Bruins can reach and sustain their potential, senior star Jordan Chiles is confident UCLA could challenge for a national title.\n\n“The talent that I see during practices is just remarkable,” Chiles said. “Every girl has their own way of showcasing that and it’s cool to know that our personalities and our talents get to collide together because it’s magical in the gym.\n\n\"We’re going to keep pushing and keep pushing.\"\n\nWith such a young team, McDonald wants her freshmen to get as much experience as possible.\n\n“First few meets of the year, we really wanted to have a lot of takeaways to build from and to learn from,” she said. “I saw some really great adjustments from week one to week two in how we handle our nerves, how we handle the warmups, how we show up for each other.\"\n\nShe attributes that development to a personalized coaching approach that emphasizes strong communication with each gymnast.\n\nChiles secured her second straight Big Ten Gymnast of the Week after posting a 39.575 all-around score in Utah. While she is the top-ranked gymnast in the nation, her focus remains on helping the team win.\n\n“She loves that she gets to do the sport she loves with the people that have her back every step of the way,” McDonald said.\n\nDuring the offseason, Chiles appeared on ABC's “Dancing with the Stars,” and finished third. Despite her very busy schedule then, she still practiced with the team every day.\n\nAfter finishing second in the nation last season, Chiles is extra motivated.\n\n“There’s fuel in my body that I just want the world to understand that the Bruins didn’t come to play this year,” Chiles said. \"It’s just a matter of time when that spark is going to finally ignite and people are gonna be very shocked.\n\n“We are just showing you bits and pieces with every meet that you see, but when it’s time to really shine and go out there and do what we need to do, we’re gonna do it.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "An NBA scout has suggested that Kobe Bryant’s enduring popularity is why LeBron James still isn’t fully embraced by Los Angeles Lakers fans — even as he continues to defy expectations at 41.\n\nLeBron James missed the first 14 games of the season due to sciatica, but has since helped the Los Angeles Lakers to a 24-15 record, putting them fifth in the Western Conference.\n\nWhat LeBron is doing this season cannot go understated, as he is playing excellent basketball at 41 years of age. But not everyone is convinced that Lakers fans are fully aware of what they’re witnessing.\n\nSpeaking to Lakers Daily, an anonymous NBA scout admitted he had been wrong about LeBron James’ decline. The scout added that James has since proved him wrong, praising his form and longevity.\n\nHowever, he argued that James’ greatness isn’t fully appreciated by the Lakers fanbase due to their unwavering support for the late Kobe Bryant.\n\n“I thought he was done after the Suns and Raptors games. He looked so bad on both ends of the floor. I was like, ‘Yeah, Father Time finally got LeBron.’”\n\n“It’s too bad he’s on the Lakers because those fans will never truly appreciate the greatness they are seeing because they are loyal to Kobe, which is stupid because Kobe loved LeBron.”\n\n“Ever since that Raptors game, he has looked unbelievable. He looks like a top-10 player in the league again. It’s incredible. We will never see a player be this good for so long ever again.”\n\nLeBron James has averaged 22.7 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.8 rebounds this season, continuing to lead the LA Lakers in key categories.\n\nSince his return, the team has gone 13-9 in games he has played, with his leadership and playmaking driving their push up the Western Conference standings.\n\nThe 21-time All-Star’s ability to sustain elite production this season has left scouts, analysts, and fans in disbelief.\n\nEven at 41, his physicality and consistency remain unmatched, a testament to his preparation and longevity in a league that rarely spares aging players.\n\nWhile comparisons to Kobe Bryant have long defined his tenure in Los Angeles, the scout’s comments suggest James’ accomplishments may never be fully appreciated by some sections of the Lakers fanbase — even as he continues to rewrite NBA history in purple and gold.",

    "fullText": "Birmingham City manager Amy Merricks says their ambitions should be taken seriously after signing Sweden midfielder Wilma Leidhammar from IFK Norrkoping for an undisclosed club-record fee.\n\nSwedish media report the fee to be £316,000 which would surpass the £308,000 Arsenal paid Hammarby for Australia midfielder Kyra Cooney-Cross in 2023.\n\nThe Blues, who currently sit second in the WSL 2, are pushing for promotion back to the top tier and are competing in the FA Cup fourth round this weekend.\n\nLeidhammar, 22, is an exciting addition from Sweden's Damallsvenskan, where she scored eight goals in 25 games last season.\n\n\"We've had a really, positive window and we're not done yet. We've added lots of players with really good experience and high potential to play at the pinnacle of women's football and that's where we want to be as a club,\" said manager Merricks.\n\n\"I've seen Wilma play for Sweden's youth teams multiple times. She brings, not only her ability on the pitch, but desire and professionalism.\n\n\"If anyone didn't take our ambitions seriously, I hope they really do after this window. It shows what we're pushing for.\"\n\nBirmingham City take on third-tier side Hull City on Sunday (14:00 GMT) and Merricks says the Blues want to go all the way in the FA Cup.\n\nShe has urged her players to build on their positive start to the campaign which puts them in a strong position for the WSL 2 title race.\n\n\"We have a really good foundation and are in a good position. I don't have to do all the talking. The players set out their targets and know what they want to achieve.\n\n\"For me, it's about driving the actions and the performance behaviours that will get us success. I'm really happy with where we are but we want to push for more.\n\n\"We haven't been quiet about it. We want to win the league. That comes with a relentless desire every day to make sure our actions match that. Our job isn't done.\"",

She netted nine goals in the 2025 Damallsvenskan and provided seven assists. She has captained IFK Norrköping on several occasions during her time at the club.\n\nOn the international stage, Leidhammar has represented Sweden at various youth levels. The next step will be to push for senior honours.\n\nAfter joining Birmingham City, Leidhammar said “I’m really excited. First to meet them, then to train, play games, hopefully win and get promoted in the end. That is, of course, the dream.\n\n“From my first conversations with Amy [Merricks] and Hope [Powell], I could feel the ambition of the club straight away, and it felt like the right place for me.\n\n“I play with a lot of passion, play with my heart out, and it’s really important for me to enjoy every moment.”\n\nLeidhammar will be available for selection for Birmingham City once the necessary international clearance has been received.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United boss Marc Skinner says Ella Toone has \"a chance\" of being available for February's Champions League ties against Atletico Madrid.\n\nEngland attacking midfielder Toone sustained a hip injury in late December that ruled her out of Saturday's goalless draw with Arsenal in the Women's Super League.\n\nSkinner said the problem was likely to keep Toone, 26, sidelined for \"six to eight weeks\" in total.\n\nAbout half that time has now elapsed, with United travelling to play Atletico in the Champions League last 16 on Thursday, 12 February and hosting the second leg seven days later.\n\nIn Toone's absence, United have bolstered their attack with the signing of Sweden striker Ellen Wangerheim, 21, from Hammarby on a three-year deal.\n\nPrior to last Saturday, Toone had featured in every WSL match for United this season, scoring three times and providing five assists.\n\nWith United still in contention for the three domestic competitions as well as in the hunt for European silverware, Skinner has to balance the desire to have Toone in his team with the risk of potentially accelerating her recovery too quickly.\n\n\"There is a chance she could be back going into those windows, but it moves every day,\" he said. \"It is what is best for Ella as well.\n\n\"We can't rush her back. She will be ready for football before the end of the season for sure.\"\n\nTalented Sweden striker Wangerheim is the latest addition to a United attack that has also been reinforced with Germany star Lea Schuller this window.\n\nWangerheim arrives in Manchester after scoring 17 goals for Hammarby to help them finish second in the Swedish league in November.\n\nShe was an unused substitute for Sweden when England beat them on penalties in the European Championship quarter-finals last summer.\n\nSkinner said the new signing will allow his side to be \"more unpredictable\" in their quest to win titles this season.\n\n\"I thought we were becoming too predictable,\" he said. \"The Manchester United spirit is about attacking with speed and invasion - and she brings that in abundance.\n\n\"She is a lovely quiet character off the field. On it, she gets alive. She wants to take people on and run behind and I felt we had lost that a little bit.\n\n\"She is 21 but has so much experience already. She had 3,000 minutes in 2025 but still sits in the category of us being able to add lots of quality to her football too.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Max Verstappen acknowledged that Red Bull’s prospects this season are an “unknown” until the cars take to the track, given the regulation shake-up.\n\nNew engine and chassis regulations threaten to alter the order on the grid in 2026, as Red Bull builds its own engine for the first time alongside Ford.\n\nRed Bull unveiled their striking new car livery at a launch event in Detroit on Thursday night and four-time F1 world champion Verstappen, who just missed out on a fifth consecutive title by two points last year, admitted the drivers will need some time to adjust to the new rules, which include “active aero” and “overtake mode” to replace DRS.\n\n“It’s all still a bit unknown,” Verstappen said. “Of course, it’s a very big, big change with the engine, the car, as you can see also the dimension of the car has changed a bit.\n\n“So for us drivers as well initially, we’ll take a bit of time to adjust. And that’s why it’s very important during the test days that we are getting our laps, so we can optimise everything as well as possible.”\n\nVerstappen was present alongside team principal Laurent Mekies and new teammate Isack Hadjar – his fourth different teammate in 15 months – as Red Bull revealed their throwback livery on Thursday.\n\n“The gloss is cool, it is a more retro look, the colour is really bold and blue, I really like it,” Verstappen said. “Seeing it in real life was special and I was really impressed and surprised by how much of a change it is.\n\n“The whole look brings back a lot of great memories of back in the day when I was just starting out in F1 and everything was new.\n\n“I’m excited to drive a car with a completely different look. I’m not sure the mechanics will be happy about the time it’ll take to keep this clean!\n\n“But it’s going to look really slick and will be nice for everyone to see out on track.”\n\nThe first of three pre-season tests takes place in private in Barcelona from 26-30 January. The new season starts on 8 March with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne.",

    "fullText": "Nasser Al-Attiyah moved a step closer to a sixth Dakar Rally crown by claiming victory on the penultimate stage of the 2026 event on Friday.\n\nThe Dacia driver led the majority of the 311km test between Al Henakiyah and Yanbu, with Ford duo Mitch Guthrie and Mattias Ekstrom only briefly interrupting his hold during the day.\n​\nAl-Attiyah first shot to the front just before the 100km mark, dispatching early leader Guthrie as team-mate Sebastien Loeb briefly made it a 1-2 for Dacia.\n​\nEkstrom snatched the top spot from Al-Attiyah at the third checkpoint, but the latter bounced back in the next 50km to reinstate the status quo.\n​\nThe gap between the two remained under a minute for the next phase of the stage, but Al-Attiyah managed to extend his advantage to 1m38s at the final checkpoint before the finish, as Guthrie and Toyota’s Toby Price also joined the fight for victory.\n​\nIn the final dash to the finish, Al-Attiyah managed to avoid any late drama to secure the stage win by 1m04s, sealing his second victory of 2026.\n​\nIt also marked the 50th stage win of his illustrious Dakar career, drawing him level with record holders Stephane Peterhansel and Ari Vatanen as the most successful drivers in the rally’s history.\n\nGuthrie ultimately prevailed in the fight for second, recovering from being four minutes down earlier in the stage to edge out his more experienced team-mate Ekstrom.\n​\nThe Swede tumbled to fourth at the finish, albeit only 1m49s back from Al-Attiyah, after Price upped his pace in his factory Hilux to secure the final spot on the stage podium.\n​\nEryk Goczal and his father Marek Goczal again managed to mix with the factory teams, finishing fifth and sixth respectively with Energylandia Toyota.\n​\nBoth managed to eclipse nine-time World Rally champion Loeb, who was demoted to seventh at the end of the stage, more than five minutes behind team-mate Al-Attiyah.\n\nMeanwhile, Nani Roma’s hopes of claiming a third Dakar win suffered a major setback with an uninspired drive to eighth, losing more than six minutes over the course of Stage 12.\n​\nHenk Lategan, who dropped four hours on Thursday due to a broken bolt, wound up in ninth for the factory Toyota team, with team-mate Seth Quintero finishing two places behind in 11th.\n​\nThey were separated by Carlos Sainz Sr in another of the factory Fords, the rally legend yet to register a stage win in the 48th edition of the event.\n​\nWith only a 108km loop in Yanbu to run on Saturday, Al-Attiyah leads the overall standings with an extended advantage of 15m02s over Roma, securing his grip on that sixth Dakar title.\n​\nEkstrom leapfrogged Loeb to grab third place, but with just 29 seconds separating the two, the fight for the final podium spot remains on.\n​\nSainz has settled into fifth, while sixth-placed Mathieu Serradori (Century) is being chased by Dacia driver Lucas Moraes.\n​\nPrice remains Toyota’s highest-placed driver in eighth ahead of team-mate Quintero, with Guthrie climbing back into 10th place.\n\nDakar 2026, Stage 11: Mattias Ekstrom leads Ford 1-2-3, Henk Lategan out of contention\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Zinchenko has struggled for minutes since arriving at the City Ground and was replaced at half-time in last week’s FA Cup defeat at Wrexham, with reports suggesting Forest may look to cut the deal short ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Arsenal.\n\nDyche said: “We have spoken to the player, made it clear of his situation, he is aware of that so we will see what happens. He is a thorough professional, he has been and I am sure he will be going forward.”\n\nThe Ukraine international would not be eligible to face Arsenal under Premier League rules on loanees playing against parent clubs, although he has started only four league matches for Forest this season and just once under Dyche, so even if he could be selected it is unlikely he would be.\n\nZinchenko has also missed seven Premier League matches with a groin injury after feeling pain during a Europa League game against Porto on October 23 and being substituted at half-time.\n\nAt Arsenal, he missed a total of 48 matches for club and country since the start of the 22/23 season.\n\nDyche was appointed on 21 October 2025 and Zinchenko has played 280 minutes under him across five of the 18 matches Forest have played since his arrival.\n\nArsenal have no place for him in their squad, so even if an agreement could be found to cut the loan deal short, the Gunners would likely be looking for another loan or permanent sale.\n\nZinchenko is out of contract with Arsenal in the summer and so is free to agree a deal with a foreign club during this window for a free move in the summer.

    "fullText": "Talented Sweden striker Ellen Wangerheim is the latest addition to a Manchester United attack that has also been reinforced with Germany star Lea Schuller this window.\n\nWangerheim arrives in Manchester after scoring 17 goals for Hammarby to help them finish second in the Swedish league in November.\n\nShe was an unused substitute for Sweden when England beat them on penalties in the European Championship quarter-finals last summer.\n\nBoss Marc Skinner said the new signing will allow his side to be \"more unpredictable\" in their quest to win titles this season.\n\n\"I thought we were becoming too predictable,\" he said. \"The Manchester United spirit is about attacking with speed and invasion - and she brings that in abundance.\n\n\"She is a lovely quiet character off the field. On it, she gets alive. She wants to take people on and run behind and I felt we had lost that a little bit.\n\n\"She is 21 but has so much experience already. She had 3,000 minutes in 2025 but still sits in the category of us being able to add lots of quality to her football too.\n\nAfter completing the move, Wangerheim said: \"I am so excited. It feels amazing to be here. It's a huge club with big history.\n\n\"Sitting here in this shirt is a proud moment for me. It's always been my dream to move abroad and to play in another country, in Europe and in a really big football club.\"",

    "title": "The peril ‘true fans’ now face after Fifa’s World Cup ticket deadline",
    "description": "Many England fans have had to commit to World Cup tickets after Fifa’s deadline for initial applications passed on Tuesday, though how much they’ll have to pay – whether $60 or $7,000 - is still unknown",
    "fullText": "The deadline for initial World Cup ticket applications passed on Tuesday, with many England fans having no idea what they’ll end up paying, despite having to commit. The difference could end up being thousands of dollars, but they now can’t cancel.\n\nSome fans eligible for the limited $60 (£44.75) “category 4” tickets will still be sitting near relatives in the same section, facing thousands of dollars in difference. There have been many similar stories. A number of supporters naturally rushed to book already expensive hotels and flights when the schedule was confirmed on 6 December, only to make the difficult decision to cancel once prices were actually announced a few days later. A new system, which represents an inexplicable shift from all recent tournaments, has ensured some tickets have gone up to five times the price of Qatar. The initial backlash forced Fifa into a minor climbdown, where 10 per cent of tickets for all qualified teams – the Participating Member Associations (PMA) – were brought into a fixed $60 “category 4”. There’s an immense jump to category 3.\n\nDiscussion groups involving members of the England Supporters Travel Club (ESTC) feature comments like “obscene”, “blatant exploitation”, a “preying on loyalty and the feeling this is priceless”, and ultimately: “Fifa can stick it. They’ve ruined the best tournament in the world.”\n\nAll of which represents a doubt and uncertainty that cuts a very different tone to Fifa’s bombastic press release about “500 million ticket requests” and how this set “a new benchmark for demand in the history of world sport”.\n\nSupporter groups have nevertheless expressed cynicism at those figures, and the manner in which they escalated over the 33-day application period, despite Fifa stating that unique credit card data has been used for validation.\n\nSuch claims don’t mesh with experience on the ground. Data from Football Supporters Europe (FSE) – who represent fan groups across the continent – suggests that the level of interest is comparable with Qatar. That tournament barely saw any major fan group travel outside Argentina, Mexico, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. That might end up a concern given that Fifa said on Tuesday the highest number of applications outside the hosts came from Germany, England, Brazil, Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nIt is certainly a concern as regards how this tournament will feel, look and sound, and whether there will be enough emotionally invested fans to create the atmosphere that really amplifies a World Cup. Essentially, what Argentina brought to 2014 and 2022.\n\nFans who actually have confirmed orders laugh wryly at the Fifa sign-off – typically underneath figures reaching around $7,000, potentially breaching many credit limits before hotels and flights – that reads: “Thanks for being a true fan!”\n\nSuch marketing speak was echoed by president Gianni Infantino in Tuesday’s statement: “I would like to thank and congratulate football fans everywhere for this extraordinary response. Knowing how much this tournament means to people around the world, our only regret is that we cannot welcome every fan inside the stadiums.”\n\nExcept, this gratitude is apparently expressed in prices that ensure only a certain tax band can actually afford to be welcomed inside the stadiums, in a system that doesn’t seem to truly recognise this “meaning”.\n\nAs written in The Independent before, the entire story articulates a central tension in 2026 football, which is that between its cultural importance and the will to make it a mere entertainment commodity. Fifa, officially a not-for-profit charity, seems to very much be leaning towards the latter.\n\nDuly, there is a deepening anger at the lack of attention to a genuine social issue within this. The Independent has already reported how the normally protected accessibility tickets are appearing on Fifa’s own resale site at six times the price, amid the controversy that carers will also be charged in a decision that goes against the body’s own statutes on human rights.\n\nThose within Fifa privately stress that the US hosting has thrown up more legal complications than any previous World Cup, especially with how legislation prevents requests for proof of disability, leading to the current system.\n\nFan groups counter that this is another case of “a pinch of truth being expanded to justify the whole ticketing policy”. They argue that Fifa knew all of this years in advance, so could have come up with multiple different solutions or guardrails, and that there’s nothing to prevent making a companion ticket free of charge or putting accessibility in the cheapest category.\n\nThey proffer that the same applies to the ongoing debate over the US “secondary market” – in other words, legalised touting – that Fifa insiders say “throws up completely new challenges than anything we’ve faced before”.\n\nAgain, multiple proactive solutions were possible, including protecting PMA tickets from transfer. There’s instead a feeling that Fifa is just seeking to earn resale differences themselves rather than tackle the issue.\n\nThat runs alongside ongoing frustration that the FA are not more outspoken on behalf of England fans. The body’s general stance is that the idiosyncratic top-down nature of football politics means they can be most effective in raising issues behind the scenes. It’s understood the FA did relay concerns to Fifa amid the initial backlash, and that this played a part in the creation of category 4 tickets.\n\nHowever, the highly limited number has created a headache for the FA, as travelling fans who fall just outside the caps needed for $60 tickets face ballots to see whether they are in the much more expensive category 2 rather than 3. Such fans pay £70 every two years to be a member of the ESTC and generally go to at least 11 away games over four years, in the hope that such loyalty will be rewarded, only to be faced with what they feel is “exploitation”.\n\nThat has fostered further frustration with the FA strategy, and questions like “what results can they actually point to?” Ultimately, the big nations have never even tried to properly challenge Infantino’s Fifa as a bloc.\n\nFor the FA’s part, they have been more proactive than many of their counterparts, amid a lament that the initial backlash has waned. Belgium and Denmark have instead parroted Fifa’s lines about raising money for the global game and the need to conform to the US market.\n\nSuch responses also cut to the core of all this, Fifa’s power structure, and how it was decided. Pricing ultimately came from those close to Infantino, with very little information dispersed – even to the Fifa Council.\n\nWhen pressed, insiders ultimately resort to those same justifications: raising money for the game, and “demand”.\n\nThat’s despite Fifa’s immense surpluses coming from the old pricing system, and the key point that they just do not have to concern themselves with demand. What’s more, no previous World Cup has conformed to the host market.\n\nBut what of the future? As one senior official said, “the sad part is that it’s probably done”. In other words, the prices are set for this tournament. Just one of many further questions is what happens if it’s a commercial success.",

    "title": "Feldera's Visual Profiler",
    "description": "We built a browser-based visualizer to dig into a Feldera pipeline's performance metrics. This tool can help users troubleshoot performance problems and diagnose bottlenecks.",
    "fullText": "Feldera is essentially a SQL query engine. There are countless query engines; each database includes a query engine, and there are even more query engines that are not part of a traditional database, e.g. Apache Spark. The query engine is the component of the database that is given a query written in the SQL programming language and which computes the result of that query based on the current content of the database.\n\nWhat differentiates Feldera from most existing query engines is the focus on incremental view maintenance. The main use case for Feldera is when users have a continuously-changing database but a slowly changing set of queries. The second time a query is evaluated, Feldera takes advantage of information acquired during the prior execution to compute the result faster than a traditional database would do. Feldera does that by only computing what has changed from the previous computation.\n\nThe SQL language is composed from a set of primitive operations that all compute on data collections (also called relations); these operations are named SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc. A SQL query is composed of a combination of these operations.\n\nThis query is composed of three operators, executed in the following order:\n\nStandard query engines implement query evaluation by compiling SQL programs into a dataflow graph representation, optimizing this representation, and then executing this representation by feeding the data in the database as inputs.\n\nWhat is a dataflow graph? It is a representation of a program composed of two kinds of objects: nodes and edges. Nodes represent computations, and edges show how data flows between nodes. Dataflow graphs can be represented visually as networks of boxes and arrows: the boxes are the computations, which the arrows show how data produced by a node is consumed by other nodes. For SQL programs you can think of the nodes as roughly representing the SQL primitive operations, while each edge represents a collection: the result produced by the node when it receives inputs.\n\nThe dataflow graph for the previous query is the following:\n\nFeldera's query engine works in a very similar way. The Feldera SQL compiler has two stages: in a first stage it uses the Apache Calcite infrastructure to compile the query into a query plan, which is optimized using the Calcite optimizer. Afterwards the plan is converted to an incremental plan, where each operator is substituted with an operator that does not compute on collections, but rather on changes, which are described by Z-sets.\n\nUnlike database queries, Feldera queries are supposed to run continuously, each receiving many input changes and producing many output changes. So Feldera queries are compiled into a pipeline, which then runs for a long time, receiving inputs and producing outputs.\n\nAs you can see, there is a long way between the program you write (in SQL) and the program that will be executed to process the data (the pipeline). What can you do if your program is too slow, or requires too many resources (runs out of memory or disk space)? How can you understand where the problems are and how can you perhaps rewrite the program to make it more efficient?\n\nUntil recently there was no easy way for Feldera end users to answer this question. Even experienced members of the Feldera team had to spend an inordinate amount of time to understand and troubleshoot the behavior of programs. No longer! Enter the Feldera profiling visualization tool.\n\nProfiling in programming is the technique of measuring and understanding the\nbehavior of computer programs.\n\nWe added lots of instrumentation code which collects measurements about the behavior of each operator in a pipeline. These measurements are aggregated into measurement statistics. For example, the pipeline will measure how much time an operator spends to process each change. During the lifetime of a pipeline each operator may be invoked millions of times, so the information is summarized, for example, as the \"total time\" spent executing this operator.\n\nThere are many interesting measurements that may be collected: how much data is received by the operator, how much data is produced by the operator (note that an operator like WHERE produces less data than it receives), how much data was written to disk, how much memory was allocated by an operator, when searching for a value what is the success rate (for JOIN operations), etc.\n\nFeldera pipelines are designed to take advantage of multiple CPU cores (and soon will be also be able to take advantage of multiple computers). When you start a pipeline you specify a number of cores, and each operator of the dataflow graph is instantiated once for every core. Sometimes, data needs to be moved between cores, and then a special operator called exchange is used. When you allocate 2 cores, the previous pipeline may actually look like the following picture:\n\nThe exchange operator is the dotted box which has the cross-arrows showing data movement between cores.\n\nDuring execution each of the cores will collect separate profiling measurements.\n\nA large SQL program can be composed of a thousands of operators, each of which can be executed on tens of cores, and each of which can collect hundreds of measurements. How can we make sense of all this data?\n\nWe built a tool to graphically display the performance data produced by a running pipeline and to allow users to interactively browse this data. We describe here only the core capabilities of this tool, because it is still under very active development, and the actual user interface and features are still changing.\n\nThe profile visualization tool lets you display the dataflow graph of the program. The following screenshot shows the dataflow graph for our little example program:\n\nYou will notice that there are two subgraphs: the one on the left has been created by the compiler, and shows how the content of the system built-in error_view is produced (for this program the content is always an empty constant - there can be no errors). The graph on the right is from the SQL program itself.\n\nThis dataflow graph actually has two outputs: one for the view v on the right, and one for the input table t itself. Each table has automatically an attached view which allows the user to monitor the table's content.\n\nA drop-down box allows you to select any of the collected metrics:\n\nThe nodes in the graph are colored according to the selected metric: nodes are white when the metric is low, and nodes are red when the metric is high, with various shades of pink to show values in between. For the previous program the currently selected metric is time%; this means that the red nodes are the places where most of the execution time is spent.\n\nVarious pieces of information can be overlaid on top of the dataflow graph. For example, hovering or clicking on a node in the graph will display all the metrics collected during the program's execution for that node. These metrics are displayed as a table, with one column for each core:\n\nBecause this table has 8 data columns, it follows that this program was executed on a machine with 8 CPU cores.\n\nIn addition, information such as the original approximate SQL source code position for the node is displayed if it is available:\n\nWhen hovering with the mouse over a node, or clicking over a node, the reachable nodes through the graph are displayed by coloring incoming (blue) and outgoing (red) edges:\n\nSome dataflow graph operators are actually little graphs themselves; these are displayed as boxes with rounded corners. The following image shows a region named n_r0 region which expands to three operators, implementing the Feldera version of the exchange operator described above. (This operator has 3 stages: send, receive, and merge). Double-clicking on such operators will expand them further. Double-clicking on an expansion will contract it again.\n\nThe profiling data can be collected directly from a running job or by saving a support bundle. The profiling data is saved in a json file, and it can be sent for troubleshooting remotely, without requiring direct access to the cluster where the pipelines are running.\n\nIn future articles we will describe various use cases for using the profiler to troubleshoot performance problems and optimize programs.",

    "fullText": "A landmark United Nations treaty protecting marine diversity in international waters is due to enter into force, after 81 governments agreed to include it in their national laws.\n\nIn total, 148 countries, representing more than three-quarters of all UN member states, have signed on to the High Seas Treaty since it was adopted in June 2023.\n\nCountries that have fully ratified the treaty in their national laws include island nations such as Palau, Cuba and the Maldives, as well as some of the world’s biggest economies, including China, Germany, Japan, France and Brazil.\n\nComing into force on Saturday and officially known as the Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), the treaty offers new protections to an area covering two-thirds of the world’s oceans and as many as 10 million different species, many of which are still unidentified.\n\nRebecca Hubbard, the director of the High Seas Alliance, a nongovernmental organisation that supports the treaty, said the agreement offers a means to protect an “extraordinary part of our planet”.\n\n“The High Seas are full of life, from tiny plankton all the way up to the great whales that rely on them,” Hubbard said in a statement.\n\n“We’re only just beginning to understand how important this vast, interconnected world is for the health of our entire planet,” she said.\n\n“Whether it’s underwater mountains, deep-sea plains and trenches, the icy polar waters, or the open-ocean highways that migratory species travel, the High Seas are as vital as they are immense,” she added.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has previously described the treaty as “a lifeline for the ocean and humanity”, as it faces threats including “climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution”.\n\n“Covering more than two-thirds of the ocean, the agreement sets binding rules to conserve and sustainably use marine biodiversity, share benefits more fairly, create protected areas, and advance science and capacity-building,” Guterres said last year, urging governments that had yet to ratify to do so soon.\n\nThe United States, which signed on to the agreement in 2023, is one of a number of holdouts, alongside India, the United Kingdom and Russia, according to a list of signatories maintained by the UN.\n\nCountries that have signed on but have yet to ratify the treaty are not legally obliged to fulfil its requirements, but are meant to refrain from activities that are contradictory to the treaty’s objectives.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has announced that his country plans to withdraw from a wide range of UN conventions and treaties, although it did not include the High Seas Treaty in a list of 66 UN and international organisations it plans to leave, released last month.\n\nTrump has also signed a controversial order to boost deep-sea mining, promised to expand offshore drilling for oil, and sunk an agreement to clean up polluting fuels in global shipping.",

    "description": "Airline Ratings has revealed its Top 25 Safest Full-Service and Low-Cost Airlines for 2026, highlighting excellence in turbulence prevention, crew expertise, and overall safety.",
    "fullText": "AirlineRatings.com, the world’s only airline safety and product rating website, has announced its Top 25 Safest Full-Service and Top 25 Safest Low-Cost Airlines for 2026 from the 320 airlines it monitors.\n\nIn compiling the list, CEO Sharon Petersen stressed that it is important for the travelling public to understand just how narrow the margins are between the world’s safest airlines, and that small numerical differences should not be interpreted as gaps in safety. She explained:\n\n“What stands out this year is how little separates the leaders. Less than four points covered positions one through 14, and at the very top the margins were even tighter, with just 1.3 points separating positions one through six in the full service category. We may be reaching a point where traditional rankings risk being misleading, and where grouping airlines into performance tiers provides a more accurate reflection of reality. All airlines in the Top 25 are world leaders in aviation safety, and claims that one is significantly safer or less safe than another are both sensationalist and false.”\n\nExplaining the methodology behind the rankings, she said:\n\n“Much of our criteria remains consistent year on year and considers incident rates adjusted for the total number of flights, fleet age, serious incidents, pilot training and international safety audits. One change for this year is that we are placing a greater emphasis on turbulence prevention, as it remains the leading cause of in-flight injuries. To support this, we consider an airline’s participation in the IATA Turbulence Aware1 programme or equivalent, as well as the Airline Ratings onboard safety audit. Transparency from airlines is also critical to this process.\n\nOn changes to the World’s Safest Full-Service Airlines list for 2026, Petersen said:\n\n“This is the first year a Gulf carrier has taken the number one spot. Etihad achieved this through a combination of factors: a young fleet, advancements in cockpit safety, particularly around turbulence, a crash-free history, and the lowest incident rate per flight of any airline on the list. The airline also participated in our independent onboard safety audit and demonstrated excellent adherence to turbulence management in the cabin.\n\n“Other notable inclusions are STARLUX and Fiji Airways, both making their list debut. While we generally would not include a relatively young airline such as STARLUX, their approach to safety and transparency is exceptional, and the fact other leading airlines talk about them really says it all. Another change that will be welcomed by our readers is the reinstatement of Singapore Airlines, which was excluded in 2025 following a serious turbulence related incident. After visiting their safety and training centre and holding extensive discussions with their operations team, we are pleased to have them back on the list.”\n\nflydubai (Now considered a full-service airline and will be assessed accordingly in future publications.)\n\nIn ranking the world’s safest low-cost airlines* Petersen said:\n\n“Notable changes this year include the inclusion of Spring Airlines China, the first Chinese airline to appear on any of our rankings, and airBaltic, which has made a significant jump into the top 10. HK Express claimed the top accolade for a second time, driven by a modern fleet, exceptionally low incident rate, and an almost flawless onboard safety audit. Given Hong Kong’s stringent incident reporting requirements, this low incident rate and absence of serious incidents genuinely reflects a highly disciplined and well-run operation.”\n\nShe continued, “Overall, it is important to note that every airline featured in the 2026 list has recorded incidents over the past two years, from tail strikes to on-board fires and engine shutdowns, yet the actual incident rate per flight sits between 0.002 and 0.09 across the airlines, which is a true credit to the industry as a whole.”\n\nIn the modern era of aviation, where serious incidents are rare, inclusion in the Top 25 reflects not just excellence in aircraft and operations, but the crucial role of skilled aircrew and robust safety practices across the airline, reinforcing that safety today is defined by consistency, culture, adaptation and effective risk management across millions of flights.\n\nFor media enquiries, please email: [email protected]\n\n1: Airline Ratings is not affiliated with the IATA Turbulence Aware programme.\n\n2: Excludes Delta Air Lines' main subsidiary Endeavor Air.\n\n3 : Excludes American Airlines' main subsidiaries being Envoy Air, Piedmont Airlines, and PSA Airlines which all operate under the American Eagle brand.\n\n4: Excludes AirAsia Cambodia due to only 2 aircraft.\n\n5: Excludes Ryanair Subsidiary ‘Buzz’.\n\n6: Excludes Volaris Costa Rica and Volaris El Salvador due to fleet size.\n\n*: It is important to note that airlines operating fewer than 25 aircraft were excluded from consideration in the Low Cost Carrier category to allow focus on larger, high-frequency operations. Further, where applicable, Airline Ratings have evaluated the performance of individual airlines with their own Air Operator Certificates (AOCs) within a group, since not all group members perform equally or hold the same international audit certifications\n\nHave questions or want to share your thoughts?",

    "description": "The Venezuelan opposition leader’s efforts to share her award with the U.S. president have shaken some Norwegians’ faith in their signature soft-power tool.",
    "fullText": "María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader and last year’s Nobel Peace Prize winner, presented her prize to President Trump on Thursday during a meeting in the White House.\n\nMr. Trump took to social media several hours later to thank her.\n\n“María presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done,” he wrote. “Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you María!”\n\nThe White House shared on social media an image of Mr. Trump holding the frame containing the Nobel medal. The inscription reads that his “Principled and Decisive Action to Secure a Free Venezuela” has been recognized. The Nobel Committee has said the Peace Prize is not transferable.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Machado, speaking to reporters earlier after meeting with Mr. Trump, said she had made the presentation “as a recognition for his unique commitment to our freedom.”\n\nThe highly unusual gesture came after months of clamoring by the American president that he had deserved the prize that she was awarded for seeking to usher a peaceful transition to democracy in Venezuela.\n\nMs. Machado had repeatedly dedicated the prize to Mr. Trump and praised the U.S. military operation nearly two weeks ago that ousted Venezuela’s longtime authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro. Mr. Trump has made clear that he thought he had deserved the prize, saying he had ended several wars and castigating Norway for overlooking him.\n\nBeyond cheering U.S. intervention in her country, Ms. Machado has remained mum about a bombing campaign against boats that Mr. Trump says are smuggling drugs. The American strikes have killed more than 100 people.\n\nIt is unclear what Ms. Machado gained out of her meeting with Mr. Trump. After ousting Mr. Maduro, he declined to install her in power, saying that “she’s a very nice woman, but she doesn’t have the respect” needed to lead the country.\n\nIndependently verified vote counts in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election showed that Ms. Machado’s party had beaten Mr. Maduro by a wide margin. The Venezuelan authorities, nonetheless, declared Mr. Maduro the victor, and his government embarked on a harsh repression campaign against critics of the outcome.\n\nSpeaking to supporters and reporters in Washington on Thursday, Ms. Machado said she was “impressed” by how clear Mr. Trump was on her country’s situation and “how much he cares.”\n\nHer efforts to cozy up to Mr. Trump have been met with scorn across the Atlantic Ocean in Norway, where the prize is regarded not just as prestigious and freighted with symbolism, but also as the country’s primary soft-power tool — and where Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular. The Nobel Institute, which awards it, has been in serious damage-control mode.\n\nLast Friday, after Ms. Machado floated the idea of sharing the prize with Mr. Trump in a Fox News interview, the institute offered a reminder about what the rules governing the award allow, saying that the facts were “clear and well established.”\n\n“Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared or transferred to others,” the institute wrote. “The decision is final and stands for all time.”\n\nThe day before Ms. Machado arrived in Washington, Kristian Harpviken, the director of the institute, who is also the secretary of the committee that chooses award recipients, said he would not be drawn further into the deepening controversy.\n\n“The prize is awarded on the basis of the laureate’s contributions by the time that the committee’s decision is taken,” he said.\n\nThat explanation has been insufficient for many Norwegians.\n\n“A Nobel committee can never guard against peace prize laureates committing acts that run counter to the intention of the prize,’’ Lena Lindgren, a columnist for the Norwegian weekly Morgenbladet, said in an interview. “But what is new now is that the prize is being used in a political game, a warlike game.”\n\nMs. Machado’s trip to Washington also drew derision from those now in power in Venezuela. Speaking in Caracas on Thursday, Venezuela’s interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez, who gained the Trump administration’s support in taking over after Mr. Maduro’s ouster, took aim at Ms. Machado in a thinly veiled reference.\n\n“And if one day, as acting president, I have to go to Washington, I will do so with my head held high, not on my knees,” she said.\n\nIt is far from the first time the Nobel committee has been criticized for its choice, or been accused of abetting violent leaders or governments.\n\nGlobal outrage followed the choice of President Barack Obama, who at the time was presiding over military engagements on several continents.\n\nAnd less than a year after receiving the award, Abiy Ahmed, the president of Ethiopia, embarked on a scorched-earth campaign in his country’s Tigray region that left hundreds of thousands dead, wounded and starving. Henry Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ were awarded the prize before a cease-fire to end the Vietnam War broke down, with Mr. Kissinger ultimately trying to return the prize amid a wave of protests. His North Vietnamese counterpart rejected it outright.\n\nWhat makes the dispute swirling around Ms. Machado unusual, according to Asle Sveen, a former researcher at the Nobel Institute, is Norwegians’ particularly dim view of Mr. Trump.\n\nMs. Machado “has dedicated her Peace Prize to a highly controversial president, to put it mildly,” Mr. Sveen said. “It is nearly universally accepted in Norway that Donald Trump attacks liberal democracy.”\n\nA Norwegian tabloid, Nettavisen, conducted a poll before the announcement of the award that found three-quarters of respondents were against it being bestowed on Mr. Trump, even if he were instrumental in orchestrating a peace agreement in Ukraine or Gaza.\n\n“The Nobel Committee has compromised the prize” by not foreseeing how Ms. Machado and Mr. Trump would use it to justify military intervention in Venezuela, Ms. Lindgren said. “Norway has been politically embarrassed and has failed to manage the symbolic capital.”\n\nFollowing the 2024 election in Venezuela, Ms. Machado went into hiding for more than a year. In December, she secretly left Venezuela to receive her award in Norway. She missed the award ceremony but appeared in Oslo to greet supporters. Her escape was orchestrated by a company run by U.S. veterans with special operations and intelligence training.\n\nAmerican lawmakers, including Marco Rubio, who was then a Republican senator from Florida and is now Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, had written a letter to the Nobel Committee in 2024 advocating that they award Ms. Machado the peace prize.\n\nThey noted her “peaceful resistance to tyrants” and her “unwavering moral compass,” and said that her efforts showed the “urgent need for international solidarity in the face of aggressive and expansive authoritarianism.”\n\nThere is little doubt that Ms. Machado has long risked her safety to challenge an authoritarian government that jails opponents, tortures critics and censors the press. But she has also embraced Mr. Trump’s military buildup in the Caribbean, repeated debunked claims that Mr. Maduro manipulated U.S. elections, and parroted the Trump administration’s claim that Mr. Maduro simultaneously led two drug organizations, despite scant evidence.\n\nHer assertions fueled accusations that she was amplifying misinformation in what, until now, seemed a failed attempt to gain the American president’s support.\n\nStill, not all Norwegians agree that the award to Ms. Machado was a mistake.\n\nIf it turned out that she supported the U.S. boat strikes, that would not be the best reflection on a laureate, said Marianne Dahl, research director at the Peace Research Institute Oslo. But Ms. Machado was awarded for her pro-democracy work in 2024, Ms. Dahl said. She drew similarities between Ms. Machado and past winners who led popular movements in Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa and Soviet republics, as well as during the so-called Arab Spring.\n\n“It is easy to sit in comfortable Norway and criticize her for talking sweet to Trump,” Ms. Dahl said.\n\nThat, she noted, is exactly what many European and even Norwegian leaders have done. “And they don’t have a repressive regime pursuing them, as Machado has had,” she said.\n\nJack Nicas and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.",

    "fullText": "The team behind Baby Steps discuss why they made a whiny, unprepared manbaby the protagonist – and how players have grown to love Nate as he struggles up a mountain\n\n“I don’t know why he is in a onesie and has a big ass,” shrugs game developer Gabe Cuzzillo. “Bennett just came in with that at some point.”\n\n“I thought it would be cute,” replies Bennett Foddy, who was formerly Cuzzillo’s professor at New York University’s Game Center and is now his collaborator. “Working on character design and animation brings you over to liking big butts. I could give you an enormous amount of evidence for this.”\n\nFoddy and Cuzzillo are talking about Nate, the impressively pathetic manbaby protagonist of their profound and ridiculous comedy game Baby Steps, developed together with Maxi Boch. When I was preparing to talk to them, I felt like I was about to meet my tormentors: I spent a week last year in the grip of this purposefully, transcendentally frustrating game about going on a horrible hiking holiday with the world’s most incompetent loser.\n\nBaby Steps’ premise seems like a cruel joke at first: watch the hapless man suffer! And you will suffer too! But the more I played it, the more meaning I found in it. As the hours passed and I helped Nate overcome his own uselessness and get himself up the mountain, I came around to him.\n\n“People coming around to him is common,” Foddy says. “We’ve had a lot of people say they hated him at the outset – and then they started either identifying with him or identifying him with other people in their lives. Some people end up sexualising him. The commonality between all these things is people coming around in some way, and that is the core philosophy of the game. It should be that it starts out feeling arduous and awkward and annoying and hostile, and then we try to bring you around to find pleasure in it … that happens to Nate in the story as well. He would never go outside for a hike.”\n\nNate is a large, bearded, russet-haired 35-year-old guy with glasses who lives in his parents’ basement. He is socially awkward, a shy urinator, whiny and massively averse to accepting help from anyone. Early in the game you come across another hiker who offers you a map of the mountain; a little mini-map pops up in the corner of the screen for a few seconds before Nate refuses it and it disappears. I guffawed at this. Like most of Baby Steps, it’s a joke about the comfortable, streamlined gaming experiences that we’ve become used to. But it’s also a joke about Nate, and the kind of guy he is.\n\nTalking to Cuzzillo threw me off at first because he is also the voice of Nate; he and Foddy improvised every line in the game. But he also has a deeper connection to the character. “Nate is one manifestation of my personality,” he says. “He’s an aspect of who I am. He’s not a made-up guy. I totally have refuse-the-map guy within me. That’s deep in who I am. If someone tries to help me, I run away screaming. Sometimes that’s a joyful part of who I am, and sometimes it isn’t.”\n\n“In video games you do this too – you immediately put it on the hardest setting and turn off the assists,” attests Foddy.\n\nLike (almost) all game characters, Nate was once a stickman with a block for a head and tissue boxes for feet. Foddy and Cuzzillo ran through nine or 10 prototypes before alighting on the concept for Baby Steps, prototypes that Cuzzillo describes as “very bad”. “We were looking for something with legs,” adds Foddy, straight-faced.\n\nFoddy’s games are full of ostensibly pointless suffering. It’s a theme of his work, alongside the idea of awkwardly moving a character’s body: a previous game of his, Getting Over It, has you trying to fling a guy in a cauldron up a hill with a sledgehammer. This prototype, in which you’d individually control a character’s feet to walk them around, fit that bill: within a couple of days the blockman had become a helicopter pilot, an off-the-shop placeholder asset. It was a couple more years before he became Nate, and six more before the game was finished.\n\n“The idea is that he’s not prepared and he’s out of shape,” says Cuzzillo. “Having an unprepared character gives the player an excuse if they’re feeling like they’re insufficient. They can blame him,” Foddy elaborates. “We had the idea of a cute lumberjacky guy with a little backpack, based on one of our friends, who will never need to know that he was the inspiration.”\n\nAnother of Foddy and Cuzzillo’s friends and colleagues was the source of Baby Steps’ name. They both now teach at NYU’s Game Center, whose chair emeritus Frank Lantz burst into their office with an idea for the name; at that point the main character was a giant baby (you could argue that he still is). Plenty of infantilising imagery remains, from rivers of breast milk to massive sandcastle toys to the gigantic woman who picks Nate up and cradles him in one especially surreal scene.\n\nAs they were playtesting the game with their friends, another aspect of Nate’s personality began to emerge: his misplaced pride. “This slightly obstinate vein of toxic masculine play starts coming out, from seeing some of our friends play it in a certain kind of way,” Foddy says. One of those friends, Julian Cordero (maker of Despelote), started looking very intently off the edge of cliffs after climbing them, inspiring a scene in which Nate’s fellow hiker Mike sits on the edge of a platform contemplating throwing himself all the way down again.\n\nBaby Steps’ interesting exploration of what masculinity means to a guy like Nate is delivered both through the story and the experience of play. You can unlock short, abstract, playable flashbacks to his childhood and the humiliating experiences that have shaped him. There are also somewhat less subtle symbols around, such as the omnipresent phallic imagery. An interesting thing about this game’s meditations on masculinity is that it doesn’t involve women at all: at a time when men’s insecurities are continually being lumped on women and feminism by common-or-garden internet misogynists, this is refreshing. As Foddy says: “Men can have problems with masculinity just by themselves.”\n\nThere is one thing that Nate straightforwardly loves: fruit. Pieces of shiny fruit hang tantalisingly in almost-inaccessible places, tempting you to waste a chunk of your life trying to reach them. If you do, you are treated to a ludicrous close-up of Nate’s face as he noisily consumes it before screaming its name into the wind.\n\n“We needed something to put on top of stuff,” explains Cuzzillo, deadpan. And a selection of increasingly esoteric fruits was the obvious choice? He explains that rewarding the player would be antithetical to the game’s philosophy. “[So] what if it’s a reward for Nate? What if it’s something he loves, so you get to vicariously watch him get a reward? The day we came up with it, we recorded the first five vocal takes … It’s funniest when you’ve tried hardest for it, and what’s at the top is just him having this crazy fruit orgasm.”\n\nThe inspiration for the dumb camera angle – the wide-angle lens from the top of the forehead – was trainspotter Francis Bourgeois. “Something we both got into during Covid, when we were doing initial exploration on this game, is the vein of culture that emerges when people are critically bored,” explains Foddy. “The idea is that these fruit cutscenes are coming when the player is feeling as unhinged as Nate is when he’s enjoying the fruit.”\n\nThat is the joke that Baby Steps keeps coming back to: you might hate Nate, but also if you’re playing a game like this, then in some way you are Nate. After many, many hours on the mountain, out in the snow, you reach an ending when Nate finds a cabin owned by a donkey-man whom he’s sort of befriended on his journey. After a few false starts, he finally knocks on the door and asks to be let in from the cold. You can go for a walk after that concluding scene, but the game goes to great lengths to warn you that there’s no point. There’s nothing else out there.\n\nBaby Steps’ final joke is that it’s lying to you: there is a final cutscene at the top of the mountain. You can go find it if you want, if you’re just irredeemably that kind of person. But for me, the game’s true ending is Nate finally learning to ask for help. I was rather moved by it.\n\nAfter Cuzzillo finished his first commercial game, 2019’s Ape Out, he felt ambivalent about it. “I wasn’t sure whether it was worth it; whether, once I was at the top of the mountain, I really wished I had climbed it,” he says. But he’s feeling much better about Baby Steps in retrospect, and about Nate.\n\n“I understand it way more now after finishing it. I feel like I’m re-realising all the things the game is about… Nate is a microcosm of the whole game, where it’s both a piss-take and sincere at the same time. It’s not one or the other.”",

    "fullText": "Patrick Vallance says robots would take away ‘repetitive’ tasks, but Sadiq Khan warns AI will usher in ‘new era of mass unemployment’\n\nAdvances in AI and robotics will transform human jobs, starting with roles in warehouses and factories, the UK science minister has said, as the government announced plans to reduce red tape for robot and defence tech companies.\n\nPatrick Vallance said technological progress was creating a “whole new area” for robots to work in. “What’s really changing now is the combination of AI and robotics. It is opening up a whole new area, particularly in the sorts of things like humanoid robotics. And that will increase productivity, it will change the human job,” he told the Guardian.\n\nLord Vallance spoke as a government unit helping to deploy new technologies in Britain announced robots and defence as new sectors receiving its support.\n\nHe said factories and warehouses, already at the forefront of robot deployment, will undergo further change as a result of the new generation of humanoid robots.\n\n“Activities that require movement around warehouses and factories, or those sorts of things that can be made robotic, will be made robotic. I think they will be made robotic in many cases and therefore, will change the nature of those jobs. That’s going to be the first wave,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has warned that AI could “usher in a new era of mass unemployment”.\n\nSpeaking in his annual Mansion House speech on Thursday, Khan said artificial intelligence could destroy a significant amount of jobs in London unless ministers act to help replace jobs taken over by the technology.\n\nAsked to comment on Khan’s speech, Vallance said robots would take away “repetitive” tasks. “You take away some of the things which are less interesting, repetitive things that can be done in another way,” he said.\n\nVallance, formerly the government’s chief scientific adviser, added that the example of robotics assisting in surgery showed how the technology can enhance jobs.\n\n“Robotics is not displacing surgeons, it’s radically improving how those surgeons work and allowing things to be done with more precision,” he said.\n\nThe government announced on Friday that the Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) is expanding its remit to defence tech and robotics, with the aim of slashing red tape for companies operating in those spaces.\n\nThe Department for Science, Innovation and Technology is also releasing £52m for new hubs to drive robotics adoption in British businesses. These hubs will offer companies advice on using robots and live demonstrations. “The RIO will aim to streamline overlapping requirements to bring products to market safely, but more quickly, to improve lives and grow our economy,” it said.\n\nThe department added that autonomous drones could benefit from the wider RIO remit. Such technology could require separate approvals for aviation, data protection, and sector-specific safety rules, in an expensive process that could take months.\n\nVallance was speaking during a visit to Humanoid, a UK-based robotics company that has already deployed its prototypes in a factory operated by German industrial group Siemens.\n\nAdam Kelsall, Humanoid’s head of product management, said the company welcomed “anything that gets us into the real world and testing [robots] sooner”.",

    "fullText": "Despite restrictions announced this week, Guardian reporters find standalone app continues to allow posting of nonconsensual content\n\nX has continued to allow users to post highly sexualised videos of women in bikinis generated by its AI tool Grok, despite the company’s claim to have cracked down on misuse.\n\nThe Guardian was able to create short videos of people stripping to bikinis from photographs of fully clothed, real women. It was also possible to post this adult content on to X’s public platform without any sign of it being moderated, meaning the clip could be viewed within seconds by anyone with an account.\n\nIt appeared to offer a straightforward workaround to restrictions announced by Elon Musk’s social network this week. These had been welcomed by the prime minister, Keir Starmer, who had described the photographs generated by Grok as “disgusting” and “shameful”.\n\nAfter weeks of rising public concern, X said late on Wednesday it had “implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis”.\n\nIt said the restriction would apply to all users, including paid subscribers, and it had “zero tolerance for any forms of child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content”. But it did not specify whether people would still be able to create such images on the standalone Grok app, and then share this material publicly on X.\n\nThe Guardian found that this standalone version of Grok, known as Grok Imagine – which is easily accessible through a web browser – was still responding to prompts to digitally remove the clothes from images of women.\n\nReporters uploaded still images of fully clothed real-life women, and prompted the AI tool to dress them in bikinis. The platform responded by going further than the request, to create short videos of the women removing their clothes in the manner of a sexually provocative striptease.\n\nX has been contacted for comment.\n\nRebecca Hitchen, the head of policy and campaigns at the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said such a simple workaround should not be possible.\n\n“The continued ease of access to sophisticated nudification tools clearly demonstrates that X isn’t taking the issue of online violence against women and girls seriously enough,” she said.\n\nHitchen called on the UK government and Ofcom, the media regulator, to pressure X and other platforms “to stop the proliferation of image-based sexual abuse”.\n\n“It’s hard to believe that xAI and Elon Musk can’t work out how to prevent these images from being spewed out by Grok,” said Penny East, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society. “First, Musk decided the solution was to preserve nudification as a privilege only for those users who pay for X. Then he pledged to stop it entirely. And yet it has not stopped.\n\n“The truth is Musk and the tech sector simply do not prioritise safety or dignity in the products they create. It’s a pretty low bar for women to expect that they can converse online without men undressing them. And yet seemingly even that is impossible.”\n\nWhile Downing Street had said it felt “vindicated” by the steps X had taken, there was also caution among ministers about the extent of the changes and how they would be delivered.\n\nOn Thursday, Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, who had described the sexual manipulation of images of women and children as “despicable and abhorrent”, welcomed the move and thanked “those who have spoken out against this abuse, above all the victims”.\n\nHowever, she added: “I will expect the facts to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom’s ongoing investigation.”\n\nStarmer also demanded X to act without delay. “Free speech is not the freedom to violate consent,” he said. “Young women’s images are not public property, and their safety is not up for debate. I welcome that X is now acting to ensure full compliance with UK law – it must happen immediately.”\n\nOfcom said its formal investigation into X, launched on Monday, remained ongoing and it was “working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what’s being done to fix it”.\n\nCanada’s privacy watchdog said it was investigating xAI, while authorities in the Philippines said they were moving to block Grok, with Malaysian authorities planning to take legal action.\n\nBut the controversy may have been helpful for boosting public awareness of Grok. On Thursday, Musk shared a post claiming “popularity and real world usage are skyrocketing globally” – alongside a graph of “Grok” as a search term hitting a new high on Google Trends. Musk simply added: “Try Grok.com.”\n\nA government spokesperson said: “The Online Safety Act already requires platforms like X to prevent illegal content, including nonconsensual intimate images and child abuse material, from appearing on their services.\n\n“The secretary of state has said she expects X’s compliance with UK laws to be fully and robustly established by Ofcom’s investigation, which is already under way, and the government will not rest until social media companies meet their legal duties.\n\n“We are also taking further action through the proposed ‘nudification’ offence, which will target tools designed specifically to generate nonconsensual intimate images.”",

    "fullText": "Move comes as calls for Australia-style social media ban for under-16s grow around world\n\nTikTok will begin to roll out new age-verification technology across the EU in the coming weeks, as calls grow for an Australia-style social media ban for under-16s in countries including the UK.\n\nByteDance-owned TikTok, and other major platforms popular with young people such as YouTube, are coming under increasing pressure to better identify and remove accounts belonging to children.\n\nThe system, which has been quietly piloted in the EU over the past year, analyses profile information, posted videos and behavioural signals to predict whether an account may be belong to a user under the age of 13.\n\nAs well as analysing information the account holder provides about themselves, the technology looks at behaviour such as the videos a user publishes, and “other on-platform behaviour”.\n\nTikTok said accounts flagged by the system would be reviewed by specialist moderators rather than face an automatic ban, and may then be removed.\n\nIt also said users would have an opportunity to appeal against the removal of an account if an error had been made.\n\nOptions for age identification offered by TikTok during the appeal process include facial age estimation by the verification company Yoti, credit card authorisation or government-approved identification.\n\nThe European pilot led to the removal of thousands of accounts.\n\nThe rollout of the system comes as European authorities scrutinise how platforms verify users’ ages under data protection rules.\n\nTikTok said its system complied with data and privacy laws. “The prediction of the likelihood that someone is under the age of 13 is not used for purposes other than to decide whether to send an account to human moderators and to monitor and improve the technology,” the company said in a blogpost.\n\n“By adopting this approach, we are able to deliver safety for teens in a privacy-preserving manner. We take our responsibility to protect our community, and teens in particular, incredibly seriously.”\n\nIt said other features to protect younger users on its service included not allowing under-16s to direct-message, while under-18s have a 60-minute screen-time limit and do not receive notifications “after bed time”.\n\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, also uses Yoti to verify users’ ages on Facebook.\n\nIn December, Australia implemented a social media ban for people under the age of 16. On Thursday, the country’s eSafety commissioner revealed that more than 4.7m accounts had been removed across 10 platforms – including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snap and Facebook – since the ban was implemented on 10 December.\n\nEarlier this week, Keir Starmer told MPs he was open to a social media ban for young people in the UK after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers were spending on their smartphones.\n\nThe prime minister told Labour MPs he had become alarmed at reports of five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media was doing to under-16s.\n\nStarmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellen Roome, whose 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong, called for more rights for parents to access social media accounts of their children if they die.\n\nThe European parliament is pushing for age limits on social media, while Denmark wants to ban social media for those under 15.\n\nTikTok told Reuters the new technology was built specifically to comply with the EU’s regulatory requirements. The company has worked with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, its lead EU privacy regulator, while developing the system.\n\nIn 2023, a Guardian investigation found that moderators were being told to allow under-13s to stay on the platform if they claimed their parents were overseeing their accounts.",

This issue is presumably covered by general references to verification. With reported sanctions as high as $52,000 and multiple sanctions in the $10,000 range, surely the danger of sanctions and adverse impact on reputation merit more attention. Years ago, I clerked for a federal judge who placed cases first on the law and motion calendar when an attorney misquoted (e.g., omitting the \"not\") or miscited authorities so the assembly of attorneys and clients awaiting hearing of their matter would all learn the painful lesson.ReplyShareAndrew 15hLiked by Justin CurlAgreed that large versus small matters is an important distinction. There's just no way to mark up a 10 page contract for a small transaction in a way that is cost effective, but a prompt to \"revise this to be more seller friendly\" will get you 90% of the way there in 5 minutes and in another 10 I can spot check for which changes are appropriate and which are unreasonable or unnecessary.

But whether this provides genuine security or hidden risk depends on where the money comes from and how long it needs to last.\n\nOn Reddit's r/FinancialPlanning forum, one user asked how much they'd need saved to live on $80,000 annually, with responses emphasizing \"you need $2,000,000 today for $80,000 a year to last at least 30 years, including increases for inflation.\" The core tension is similar for anyone targeting $85,000: can your portfolio sustain withdrawals while keeping pace with inflation over 25-30 years?\n\nPrimary Challenge: Balancing sustainable withdrawals with inflation protection\n\nTime Horizon: 25-30+ years in retirement\n\nCritical Factor: Asset allocation between growth and income investments\n\nThe biggest risk isn't whether $85,000 feels comfortable today - it's whether that purchasing power survives decades of inflation. At 2.5% inflation, $85,000 in today's dollars needs to become $139,000 in 20 years to maintain the same purchasing power.\n\nUsing the 4% withdrawal rule, you'd need roughly $2.1 million invested to generate $85,000 annually. But portfolio composition matters enormously. A conservative 30/70 stocks-to-bonds allocation might feel safer short-term, but severely limits long-term growth. Based on the S&P 500's 10.8% annualized return over 20 years, a $1 million portfolio split 30/70 between stocks and bonds would grow to approximately $3.9 million over 30 years. The same portfolio at 70/30 would reach $9.2 million.\n\nThat difference determines whether your income increases with inflation or gets slowly eroded. Retirees who lean too heavily on fixed-income investments often cut spending in their 70s and 80s when healthcare costs surge.\n\nDividend-Focused Equity Exposure: Consider dividend-paying equities like those in SCHD (Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF), which currently yields 3.81%. A $500,000 allocation would generate roughly $19,000 annually in dividends while maintaining growth potential, providing income without forced selling during market downturns.\n\nLayered Withdrawal Strategy: Split your portfolio into buckets. Keep 2-3 years of expenses in cash or short-term bonds ($170,000-$255,000). Hold another 5-7 years in intermediate bonds. Invest the remainder in diversified equities. This lets you avoid selling stocks during bear markets while maintaining long-term growth.",

    "fullText": "Get in, loser, we're going back to 2016.\n\nOpen Instagram this week, and you'd think you were back in the early days of Tumblr and Snapchat. Think Lo-Fi selfies, thick winged eyeliner, and the dog-ear Snapchat filter.\n\nPeople on Instagram and TikTok, influencers and regular folks alike, have been posting throwback pictures from 2016.\n\nIn some posts, millennials openly mourned for the halcyon days of 2016, when they were free to wear skinny jeans without being scorned by Gen Z coworkers, some 20 pounds lighter, and juicing up their feeds with the Clarendon and Gingham Instagram filters.\n\nIt was also a huge year for music, yielding 2010s-defining pop hits like The Chainsmokers' \"Closer,\" Justin Bieber's \"Love Yourself,\" and Alan Walker's \"Faded.\"\n\nNo surprise, millennials are craving a walk down memory lane.\n\nKar Brulhart, a Mexico City-based social media strategist and coach, said 2016 is trending because of nostalgia and a broader shift toward analogue — think paperback books, flip phones, and digital cameras.\n\nBut beyond that, Brulhart said, revisiting the 2016 era provides relief.\n\n\"Especially in the US, where the political and cultural climate feels increasingly charged, people genuinely don't know what — or how — to post anymore. Revisiting that era gives people a socially acceptable break from having to respond, react, or perform relevance,\" she said.\n\nCelebrities like Charlie Puth, Eva Longoria, Lucy Hale, and Karlie Kloss have jumped on the trend, posting awkward, unglamorous selfies.\n\nKylie Jenner's 2016 post on Thursday, captioned \"You just had to be there,\" has gotten over 2.4 million likes as of press time. The \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" star posted pictures of herself wearing skinny jeans, black Converse high tops, and her iconic Kylie Lip Kit.\n\nMakeup artist and beauty influencer James Charles revived a full 2016 cut-crease eyeshadow routine in a TikTok video on Wednesday, which has garnered about 5.6 million views.\n\nOthers used the trend to remember milestones. John Legend posted a picture of himself and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, sharing a kiss after the birth of their first child in 2016.\n\nAnd brands wasted no time capitalizing on the throwback trend. LA-based fashion brand Reformation posted pictures of celebrities like Taylor Swift and Emily Ratajkowski in its 2016 range with the caption, \"We miss 2016 too.\"\n\nThe trend reveals a yearning for a simpler time, social media and PR experts say.\n\nHailey Bailey, the founder of Los Angeles-based PR and talent management firm Image PR, said the trend is a result of millennials like herself \"craving the innocence, promise, and naivety of our summer 2016 selves.\"\n\n\"I think most millennials look at where they are at in life right now and think, 'Wow, I thought I'd be in a different place,'\" Bailey said. \"Many of us can't afford to buy a house anytime soon, or haven't found the right partner, or are so career-focused we can't even think about having children.\"\n\nBrulhart said that in 2016, chronological posts were the only way to experience Instagram. That was before Reels, AI-generated \"slop,\" and hyper-clean, aesthetic-first feeds took over the app.\n\n\"There was far less curation, and people weren't trying to brand themselves with every post,\" she said. \"They were documenting life as it happened, not worrying about the likes or engagement.\"\n\nThe trend felt like a gentle moment of reflection to her.\n\n\"It's not about wanting to go backward, but about remembering a version of ourselves that perhaps felt lighter,\" Brulhart said.",

    "title": "Disney's sluggish stock threatens to dent CEO Bob Iger's legacy",
    "description": "Disney's stock is lagging despite CEO Bob Iger's comeback tour. Analysts broke down the reasons and the potential impact his successor could have.",
    "fullText": "Why has the market fallen out of love with Disney?\n\nBob Iger is nearing the end of a multi-year comeback run as CEO and has overseen several key improvements to Disney's business. Streaming has stopped bleeding cash. The company has mapped out a major expansion pipeline for parks and experiences. ESPN is bolstering its streaming strategy as the pay-TV bundle continues to shrink.\n\nDespite this, the stock is sitting about 43% below its 2021 peak — and it could leave a dent in Iger's legacy.\n\nDuring Iger's 15-year first run as CEO, which ended in 2020, Disney's stock surged as he transformed the company through acquisitions — Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm — that powered its movies, TV shows, consumer products, and parks. The introduction of the streaming service Disney+ in 2019 set off a growth narrative that saw the stock reach its all-time high of $198.60 in March 2021.\n\nSince then, Disney has fallen well behind the S&P 500. Disney is trading around $114 — up about 24% from the start of Iger's second term as CEO. By comparison, the S&P has gained around 75%.\n\n\"Disney was the one stock in media that you could compare to everyone else,\" longtime Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said, referring to the broader market. \"This is the lowest relative valuation it's had in more than 40 years.\"\n\nDisney is operating within a complicated environment for media giants during Iger's second run, which is reflected in the varied stock performance of its competitors. Disney has no exact peer, but shares of its biggest rival, the pure-play streamer Netflix, have gained nearly 206% since November 2022, when Iger returned to Disney. Warner Bros. Discovery — which includes a storied Hollywood studio and HBO — was lagging until takeover interest fueled a stock run. Its shares are up 165% in that time period. Shares of NBCUniversal owner Comcast, which is dealing with both a troubled cable business and a sub-scale streamer, have declined about 12%.\n\nDisney employees and everyday investors who spoke with Business Insider said they were frustrated by the stock's performance, but most believed it would eventually rebound.\n\n\"The fundamentals are there, and while the stock has lagged, it's part of a diversified portfolio, so I can afford to wait it out,\" said Dia Adams, a Disney fan and travel agent.\n\nSo, what's holding back the stock?\n\nWall Street analysts describe Disney as comprising three separate but interconnected businesses, each with its own distinct risk profile. At any given time, one of them looks shaky enough to hamper Disney's overall growth story.\n\nDisney's Entertainment division, which spans linear TV networks, streaming services, and studios, is the most complex piece. Revenue from Disney's traditional TV business continues to decline as viewers shift away from the medium. That was on full display in Disney's fiscal fourth quarter ending September 27, with linear operating income falling 21% year over year.\n\nThe streaming business has been a bright spot, with operating income up 39% year over year in the fourth quarter. However, skeptics are concerned about streaming's ability to replace linear TV's decline and point out that growth is increasingly coming from outside the US, where people are often more price-sensitive.\n\nThe streaming wars could also get tougher for Disney moving forward. Netflix and Paramount Skydance are in a bidding war over Warner Bros. Discovery, and whichever combination emerges will create a larger rival that could put pressure on Disney.\n\nThen there's Disney's studio business: hit-driven and expensive.\n\nWall Street was looking for Iger to work his magic on the movie business, and the films were \"horrific\" in Disney's 2025 fiscal year, Ehrlich said. The company blamed a decline in studio revenue on comparisons to the prior year's \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" and \"Inside Out 2.\" Things have been looking up, though, with the blockbuster performance of \"Zootopia 2\" at the box office.\n\nThe Experiences division encompasses theme parks and cruise ships, and has become a top driver of profit for Disney. The division's recent strength has relied heavily on price increases rather than a bump in attendance.\n\nThat raises a key question: How much pricing power does Disney have left?\n\nIn 2025, domestic park attendance decreased 1%, according to Disney's annual report. Disney has also faced concerns about competition in Florida from Comcast's recently opened Epic Universe, and about the delayed debut of Disney Adventure in Singapore, now scheduled for March.\n\nSports is the smallest segment of Disney's business by revenue, but it has a clear growth story.\n\nESPN is modernizing for streaming with a newly enhanced app and big direct-to-consumer ambitions. That said, the cost of sports rights is increasing, and competition is intensifying — not only from traditional rivals like Fox, but also from deep-pocketed tech companies such as YouTube and Amazon.\n\nDisney's sports spending was a topic on its latest earnings call after it paid more than a 73% increase for NBA rights in its latest deal, which kicked off with the 2025-2026 season. The company said the value to audiences and advertisers was big, even if the cost creates some \"bumpiness\" in financial results.\n\nWall Street sees no quick fix for Disney's stock. Analysts want proof of steady, repeatable earnings growth, whether from a stronger film slate, improved streaming profitability, or an expected lift from the cruise business in late 2026.\n\nThe stock price matters in ways that affect Disney operationally. Equity is critical to retaining top executives, and stagnant shares can dull the appeal of stock-based pay. This could complicate the job of Disney's next CEO.\n\nDisney's CEO succession has become a favorite parlor game, with chatter centering on Experiences chief Josh D'Amaro and Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden.\n\nRegardless of who is chosen, investors are hoping for steady leadership over reinvention. The desire for continuity limits Iger's ability to make sweeping changes in his final months.\n\n\"Typically, CEOs will try very hard to exit on a high note,\" said Laurent Yoon, US media and telecom analyst at Bernstein. \"For Iger, it's certainly not good. It's going to be difficult to get stock in a good direction, at least near term.\"",

    "title": "A millennial quit a 6-figure job at Google to pursue more meaningful work: 'I wanted more out of my career and my life.'",
    "description": "Job quitters have become outliers in a frozen hiring market. Those who do it say the uncertainty was worth it to take some agency over their lives.",
    "fullText": "Earlier this year, Joslyn Orgill faced a career-defining choice: keep her six-figure data engineer job at Google — or leave it behind to pursue a path she hoped would make her happier in the long run.\n\nThere were many reasons it made sense to stay put. For one, Orgill had long viewed Google as the top destination for aspiring technical engineers — and she'd worked hard to get there. She spent two summers interning at ExxonMobil and Adobe, and in 2021 earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree in information systems from Brigham Young University through an integrated program.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, she was doing well — and she and her husband had bought a home in Austin less than two years earlier, a decision that made staying at Google feel like the practical choice.\n\nHowever, the reasons to leave began to build — she was concerned about job security in a tech career, felt somewhat invisible at a large company, and had a growing desire to pursue work she was more passionate about.\n\n\"Google's an amazing company, but the job just wasn't a great fit for me,\" said the 30-year-old.\n\nOver the past year, I've interviewed more than a dozen workers who, like Orgill, chose to quit their jobs with a major employer — in some cases, without having another role lined up. While some eventually landed at another large corporation, others stepped away from the corporate world entirely; they joined a smaller business, pursued a venture of their own, made a career pivot, or focused on personal matters, such as parenting.\n\nThese individuals have become outliers in an economy where workers are quitting at one of the lowest rates in the past decade — a trend driven by a hiring slowdown that's left many clinging to their jobs with few alternatives. Those who have called it quits in this environment told Business Insider they did so due to concerns about job security, shifts in workplace culture, entrepreneurial ambitions, and a desire to do more meaningful work. In short, they tend to quit because they want more agency over their careers in the long run.\n\nOrgill shared how she eventually became confident in her decision — and offered advice for others facing a crossroads in their careers.\n\nOrgill's decision was shaped in part by her time at BYU, where she taught two sections of an introductory programming and analytics course as an adjunct professor. She loved it and felt she was good at it.\n\nIn November 2021, Orgill received an offer for a full-time cloud technical resident role at Google, based in Austin, with the help of a referral from her sister-in-law. After she gave her a tour of a Google office, Orgill was especially eager to join the company.\n\n\"I just loved the vibes,\" she said. \"I was really excited to work at Google.\"\n\nShe eventually settled into a full-time data engineer role, but over time, she said she began to feel \"unseen\" — and that it often didn't feel like her work was making much of an impact.\n\n\"I wanted more out of my career and my life,\" she said, \"something that I was more passionate about than what I could achieve at a big company like Google.\"\n\nOrgill considered pursuing new roles, both inside and outside Google, but said there didn't seem to be many openings she was interested in — something she attributed, in part, to a broader hiring slowdown in tech.\n\n\"I had friends who were graduating and weren't able to find jobs,\" she said, \"so I just didn't have a lot of confidence that I would be able to find something that I enjoyed more at a different tech company.\"\n\nOrgill also wasn't fully confident in her job security at Google — or in the tech industry more broadly. That concern hit home in January 2023, about six months into the job, when Google announced plans to lay off around 12,000 workers.\n\n\"It was a crazy, crazy day,\" she said. \"That was a scary time.\"\n\nAs doubts about her career grew, Orgill said her interest in teaching lingered in the back of her mind. One path she'd considered was working in tech, earning good money, and returning to teaching later in life. But over time, she began to question whether it was worth postponing what she truly wanted to do.\n\n\"I felt like there were so many reasons not to — I'm making enough money, we just bought a house — but I realized that if I don't do it now, I'll always be wondering: what if I had?\"\n\nLast August, she left her job at Google to pursue a Ph.D. in computer science with a focus on education at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nWhile she's still figuring out what she wants to do after the program — which typically takes four to six years — she's strongly considering an academic career, potentially as a professor teaching computer science or information systems courses. Her larger goal, she said, is to help broaden participation in the computer science field.\n\n\"I want other people to feel confident that they can do something with technology, even if they're from an underrepresented group,\" she said.\n\nOrgill said she received three years of funding from the university to pursue her Ph.D. and receives a modest monthly stipend. From a financial perspective, a big reason she felt comfortable resigning from Google is that her husband works remotely and kept his job when they moved to Illinois.\n\nThe couple tried to sell their home in Austin but didn't secure an offer they felt good about, so they're renting it out to friends while living in an apartment near campus. However, the rent they collect doesn't fully cover the mortgage, so they hope to sell the home eventually.\n\nOrgill said her experience in the Ph.D. program has been good so far. When she occasionally wonders whether leaving Google was the right move, she thinks back to how much she enjoyed teaching at BYU.\n\n\"That's what I go back to when I'm scared,\" she said, \"because getting a Ph.D. is a lot of work, and obviously giving up a salary and all of the benefits that I had was a big deal.\"\n\nOne of Orgill's top pieces of advice for others weighing a big career move: consider how much you're willing to give up financially to pursue more meaningful work. She added that having a supportive partner has also been crucial to making the pivot.\n\n\"My husband was incredibly supportive and wanted me to find something that I was passionate about,\" she said. \"I'm really grateful for that.\"",

    "description": "Silver prices are soaring — but industry demand could cap the rally",
    "fullText": "Silver has outshone gold in the blistering precious-metals rally, but the surge may be running into a real-world constraint: The industries that actually use the white metal may be starting to pull back.\n\n\"At some price level, fabricators and end users simply cannot absorb higher costs,\" Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, wrote on Wednesday.\n\nIndustrial applications for silver include solar panels, electronics, and chips crucial to the AI buildout.\n\n\"They either try to pass them on and fail, cut back on purchases, or look for substitutes,\" Hansen added.\n\nThe spot silver price hit a fresh record high above $93 per troy ounce this week and is already up nearly 26% in 2026. The precious metal surged about 170% in 2025, far outpacing the 73% gain in gold prices over the same period.\n\nSilver occupies a more complicated position than gold because it is both a precious metal and a core industrial input. This means it benefits from the same fear-driven demand that lifts gold, while also being tied to long-term themes such as electrification, solar energy, and electronics.\n\nThat mix made silver especially vulnerable to supply shocks. A physical short squeeze in London last year amplified the surge after inventories were left unusually thin by large flows of metal into US vaults amid tariff concerns.\n\nChinese production overcapacity and intense competition in recent years have driven up demand for the precious metal and other inputs.\n\nWith silver now trading around $91 an ounce, some industrial consumers are beginning to respond by cutting usage or turning to substitutes.\n\nRecently, major Chinese solar manufacturers Longi Green Energy Technology and Jinko Solar said they would begin substituting some silver with cheaper base metals. Even so, it may take time before slower buying and the use of existing stockpiles become visible enough to change the broader narrative around silver's boom, Hansen wrote.\n\n\"Every rally eventually meets its limit, and for silver, the most likely brake is industrial demand destruction,\" wrote Hansen.",

    "description": "Destiny says witnesses quickly started pouring milk on her children to try and alleviate the effects of the tear gas.",
    "fullText": "A family of eight traveling in their car was caught in the crossfire between protestors and ICE agents in northern Minneapolis, and it led to three of their six children — including a six-month-old baby — being hospitalized. Well, I shouldn't really say crossfire, since one group was yelling and throwing snowballs while the other was using live munitions. I'll let you guess which was which.\n\nShawn Jackson, the children's father and the driver of the car, told FOX 9 KMSP at the scene that his children, who are between six months and 11 years old, were hurt when a flashbang stun grenade (or possibly tear gas) detonated nearby. As he stood next to his SUV, which was covered in some sort of chemical residue, Jackson told the reporter that the blast from the non-lethal (but incredibly dangerous) explosive device was strong enough to set off the airbags in what appears to be his GMT800 Chevy Tahoe.\n\nDespite the fact half of Jackon's kids ended up in the hospital, everyone involved is lucky things didn't end much, much worse. Here's what he and his wife, Destiny, told FOX 9:\n\n\"Officers threw flash bangs and tear gas in my car. I got six kids in the car [...] My 6-month-old can't even breathe. This was flipped over,\" Shawn said, holding up his child's car seat. \"My car filled with tear gas, I'm trying to pull my kids from the car.\"\n\nHis wife, Destiny Jackson, told FOX 9 their 6-month-old infant stopped breathing and lost consciousness. She then performed CPR on her baby while others poured milk on her other children in an effort to neutralize the tear gas.\n\nAlong with the six-month old, their 11-year-old and seven-year-old, who has asthma, were hospitalized. Both Jackson parents also had to be treated.\n\nPeople in the area quickly sprang into action to help the Jacksons. Destiny says witnesses quickly started pouring milk on her children to try and alleviate the effects of the tear gas. Others called EMS and coached her through CPR on her infant child.\n\n\"A lot of people from the community were there trying to help us in that situation,\" she said.\n\nI'm fairly certain there are quite a few people who are ready to type FAFO with a cry/laugh emoji into the comments section and say that they shouldn't interfere in government work, but before you do that, take a step back, reevaluate your life and listen to what I'm about to tell you. The Jacksons were not part of any protest.\n\nThey were on their way home from their oldest child's basketball game, and their route just so happened to go by the protests, which they weren't aware were happening. She says they did see police lights and protestors, but the road wasn't blocked and everything was fairly calm, so they continued on their way.\n\nWhile driving through, Shawn briefly stopped to ask people on the street what was happening, and that's when Destiny spotted her mother in the crowd and attempted to get her to leave, \"before anything did happen.\" Destiny says that after about half an hour of pleading with her mother to go home, she agreed, and as they were getting ready to go, ICE descended upon the scene in their cars.\n\n\"A couple of them proceeded to start screaming in my window, and they were saying, 'Get out of here. Get the F- out of here.'\" Destiny told FOX 9. She went on to say that she told the screaming ICE agents that if they moved away from their car, they would gladly leave, which is what they were trying to do the whole time.\n\n\"We know what happened when Renee tried to move. You guys said that she hit you when she didn't,\" Destiny said during the interview. It's not just Renee Good of course, 13 people have been shot at in their cars by ICE agents.\n\nAfter not moving their cars, the Jacksons were stuck.

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - India has issued a final warning to Apple that it will proceed in an antitrust case ​against the U.S. tech giant as the company has delayed responses to ‌officials for over a year and undermined the investigation, a confidential order shows.\n\nApple has said it fears ‌it could be fined up to $38 billion if India's competition watchdog uses its global turnover calculation for penalties, after an investigation found it had abused its position on its app store. Apple, which denies the allegations, has challenged the penalty rules in ⁠an Indian court, and the ‌matter is pending.\n\nWhile the Delhi High Court is still hearing that challenge, a confidential December 31 order from the Competition Commission of ‍India (CCI) shows Apple privately sought to pause the entire case while the penalty‑rules dispute is before the court. The CCI rejected the request.\n\nThe watchdog said it asked Apple in October ​2024 to file objections to the investigation’s findings and provide financial details typically ‌used to assess penalties, but the company has received \"repeated extensions\" since then.\n\n\"The Commission is of the considered view that repeated extensions, despite unambiguous directions, undermine procedural discipline and impede the timely conclusion of proceedings,\" CCI noted in its order, seen by Reuters.\n\n\"Such indulgence cannot be continued indefinitely,\" it added, giving Apple a final warning ⁠that it will proceed in the case unilaterally ​if no response is received by next week.\n\nApple ​did not respond to Reuters queries.\n\nA source familiar with the matter said Apple views CCI's December order as a move to preempt the ‍ongoing court proceedings and ⁠the company was not likely to respond to it before the judges hear it next on January 27.\n\nSince 2022, Tinder-owner Match and Indian startups ⁠have been locked in an antitrust battle with Apple. Investigators in 2024 issued a report saying the ‌U.S. smartphone company engaged in \"abusive conduct\" on the iOS apps market.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Aditya Kalra, Editing by Louise Heavens)",

    "description": "Semafor CEO Justin Smith explains how his company bucked industry trends by focusing on Washington, DC, and the \"global leadership class.\"",
    "fullText": "The news business is gloomy these days, and lots of companies are bracing for more grim news: Changes in the distribution landscape are making it harder to get the news you produce in front of people who want to consume it, which means you have less revenue to make more compelling news. Which can lead to a grim cycle.\n\nBut last week, Semafor, which pitches itself as a news outlet for the global leadership class, said it was bucking the trend: The startup, launched by former BuzzFeed editor Ben Smith and former Bloomberg executive Justin Smith in 2022, had turned a profit in 2025.\n\nThe speed at which Semafor has made this work is surprising. The business plan is less so: Semafor, like other recent successful news startups, has built itself by aiming squarely at Washington, DC, and positioning itself as a way for advertisers to reach powerful CEOs and government officials who do business there.\n\nI talked to Semafor CEO Justin Smith (he's not related to Ben Smith) about why the Washington market is lucrative and how his company thinks it can make more money in the future. You can listen to our entire conversation on my Channels podcast; what follows are edited excerpts from our chat.\n\nPeter Kafka: You folks just announced that you were profitable last year, your third year in operation. You also announced that you had raised another $30 million, and made a profit of $2 million on $40 million in revenue. If you're making money, why did you raise more money?\n\nJustin Smith: If you've been in the media business for 30 years, you know the media business is pretty unpredictable. Just because you've had a good couple of years, and you've developed what we think is a really interesting model — if there's a chance to raise money, with good long-term investors, to accelerate the things that are working, it's a good idea.\n\nWe feel like it's taken three years, but we've got the foundation of what we believe is an interesting innovation in the media space. It's a new formula that is working, and we feel like we can extend it across the world and across new markets, and that's what we're going to use the new capital for.\n\nSemafor has leaned heavily into events since you launched, and you say 50% of your revenue comes from events. But that's a very hard business to scale. How do you think you'll grow?\n\nWe did almost a hundred events this year. But a lot of the energy and focus of our event strategy is around some of the bigger convenings that we do. As we go forward, the idea is not necessarily to go from a hundred to 200 to 300 events.\n\nThe strategy is much more likely to be to build a series of tentpoles that themselves become larger, more significant, more valuable commercially, more influential editorially. That's how you scale it.\n\nI've seen people talking about your ambition to take on Davos, the annual global business/policy conference happening this month. Is that a real plan?\n\nWhen we started Semafor, in the original business plan deck, we saw an opportunity to build a leading CEO convening in the United States. We looked at the US market, and we thought, \"It's interesting. This is the largest economy in the world, and there is not a dominant leading CEO convening platform.\"\n\nWe thought that was an interesting fact, which presented an opportunity. So from the very beginning, we envisioned building this from scratch. And we identified Washington, DC, as the best location to do this, which was also a little bit of an unusual choice.\n\nDC's historically not been a place where CEOs travel. It's not been historically a center of business, but that of course has been changing across the last five to seven years: The role of geopolitics in the boardroom, the rise of regulation — all these different trends have converged and now CEOs from both the United States and across the world find themselves in Washington three, four, five, 10 times a year. And we were fortunate because we made that bet.\n\nPeter: You've been describing a business that's very DC-based. You are based in DC. It's really striking that some of the most successful media startups of the last few years — you guys, Axios, Punchbowl, Puck, to some extent — are all making money or trying to make money in Washington, by matching advertisers with powerful people. How much bigger can that market get?\n\nIt's effectively a B2B marketplace. What's sometimes confusing to people is that many of these news properties, including Semafor, are consumer-facing now — consumer web pages and consumer-focused newsletters. But since the audience that they're appealing to is this segment of this leadership audience, it allows for a much more targeted type of business monetization.\n\nIn this case, it's the corporate affairs market, which is largely corporate reputation. There's also a bit of advocacy advertising.\n\nFacebook saying, \"We believe healthy regulation is a great idea.\"\n\nExactly. This market has existed for a long time, and there was a whole predecessor group of brands before Politico and Axios. You may remember Roll Call, or the Hill, or National Journal. Those were some of the most successful and profitable and commercially viable media businesses around.\n\nObviously, these new digital disruptors came along and stole the market from those legacy players. But I think what also happened is that the market grew really, really dramatically because the intersection of government and business has become more pronounced and more intense.\n\nI think the stakes have gotten higher and higher and higher for companies operating in the US, and their needs to communicate their corporate brand positions have gotten more urgent.\n\nI had heard early on that you guys were going to make your version of the networks' Sunday shows, which is fueled by that same economy.\n\nThose were some of the most profitable TV shows on television back in the day. They probably still are today.\n\nYou guys have not launched your version of a Sunday show. Do you think that's something you'll try?\n\nWe actually started with a video investment. We thought, \"Let's see if we can produce this opinion leader video.\" We tried, and were unable to really figure it out, and we ended up killing it within six months or so.\n\nBecause as a startup, I think that's probably one of the better decisions we made — just to focus on the stuff that's working, and stop doing the stuff that's not working.",

    "description": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.",
    "fullText": "Military veterans aged 65 face being mobilised under new powers to prepare the Armed Forces for war.\n\nThe Government is set to increase the age at which the nation’s pool of retired soldiers, known as the strategic reserve, can be called upon from 55 to 65.\n\nThe new measures are being introduced as part of a new Armed Forces bill, which will be published in Parliament later.\n\nThe changes will make it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former military personnel.\n\nThe Army has shrunk to its smallest number in more than 200 years, with just over 70,000 full-time, fully-trained troops ready to deploy to the frontline.\n\nUnder existing rules, the pool of retired soldiers can be called upon in the event of “national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK”.\n\nHowever, under the new changes, this will be lowered to “warlike preparations”, which is already the threshold for reservists who have recently left the Armed Forces.\n\nThe measures come amid fears Britain could be dragged into a full-scale war with Russia in a matter of years.\n\nDefence and security chiefs have repeatedly warned of the potential for large-scale war in recent months.\n\nAl Carns, the Armed Forces minister, said just before Christmas that war was “already knocking on Europe’s door” and that Britain had to be prepared for a conflict that was “bigger” than those fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nLast week, the UK announced it would be deploying troops to Ukraine, alongside France, if and when a ceasefire deal between Moscow and Kyiv is agreed.\n\nWhile it is unclear exactly how many troops could be involved, reports have suggested up to 7,500 UK personnel could be deployed.\n\nIf this figure is accurate, it would effectively mean that around 21,000 personnel would be committed to Ukraine – with one cohort deployed, another in training and a third recovering for operations there.\n\nHowever, military analysts have warned such a deployment would stretch the Armed Forces and would effectively become an “all of Army effort” to maintain.\n\nSources at the Ministry of Defence have pushed back against suggestions that 7,500 troops could be deployed, with insiders saying it could be lower.\n\nOn Friday, the Government pledged to spend £200m to upgrade armoured vehicles and buy new kit in preparation for the peacekeeping mission.\n\nThe proposed changes would come into force next year if approved by Parliament, the BBC reported.\n\nThe Government estimates there are around 95,000 people within the strategic reserve, including veterans from the Royal Navy, Army, and RAF.\n\nThese are different to the reserve forces, which comprise personnel who volunteer part-time to serve in the military. Currently, there are almost 32,000 active reservists across the three wings of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe military has struggled to recruit and retain personnel in recent years. The Army has suffered the most, having shrunk from more than 100,000 personnel in 2010 to just over 70,000 now.\n\nThe most recent figures show a very marginal increase in the number of people joining the military. But it is still at its lowest ebb since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces is grappling with a £28 billion funding black hole over the next four years despite plans to boost defence spending.\n\nSir Keir Starmer was warned about the shortfall by the head of the military, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, a few days before Christmas.\n\nOn Monday, Sir Richard admitted Britain did not have the cash to deliver its military ambitions, which were set out by the PM in June as part of the Strategic Defence Review.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff told MPs on the Commons defence committee: “I’ll be completely honest with you – we will not be able to do everything that we would wish to do as quickly as we might want to do it.\n\n“If we wanted to do everything that’s currently in the programme and do all the extra things in the SDR [strategic defence review], could we do that with the budget that we have got? The answer’s no.”\n\nThis is despite Sir Keir having announced last year that defence spending would rise from 2.3 per cent of GDP to 2.6 per cent by 2027. Looser pledges were also made in the strategic defence review to hit 3 per cent in the early 2030s and 3.5 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs part of the Strategic Defence Review, Sir Keir vowed to build 12 new nuclear attack submarines and spend billions more on new defence technology.\n\nBritain’s military spending is the subject of increasing criticism, with a parliamentary report last year warning the country was not ready to defend itself against attack.\n\nEarlier this month, the UK fell down the global defence spending rankings, and is now Nato’s 12th-biggest spender in terms of GDP compared with third in 2021.\n\nNews of the latest shortfall is said to have prompted Sir Keir to order a key MoD document, the defence investment plan, to be overhauled.\n\nThe Defence Investment Plan, which will set out how the Government’s long-term defence plans will be paid for, was originally due to be published in the autumn. However, it now appears to be stuck in financial purgatory, with Sir Richard telling MPs the MoD “do not have a date” for when it will be released.\n\nIt prompted concerns that the Armed Forces could soon be forced to make sweeping cuts to balance the books.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "title": "'Task' versus 'purpose': Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang explains why AI won't kill jobs.",
    "description": "AI may automate tasks, but your job's purpose may be immune from AI disruption. This applies to radiology, law, coding, and even waiting tables.",
    "fullText": "Hospitals, law firms, and tech companies are getting a preview of how AI is likely to reshape work: by automating tasks without eliminating the underlying jobs.\n\nThat's the core message Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized in a recent appearance on the No Priors podcast.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview, he argued that fears of mass job destruction often confuse the \"tasks\" involved in a job with the broader \"purpose\" of the role. AI, in his view, changes how tasks get done, but the purpose remains the same. And that means, the technology probably won't destroy jobs and could even increase demand for the people responsible for outcomes at work.\n\nHuang's framing is straightforward: Most jobs contain repeatable tasks that technology can compress, and a broader purpose that remains human-led. He highlighted radiology as a real-world example.\n\nYears ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted that AI would eradicate many radiology jobs and advised students to avoid the field. The opposite happened. While AI is automating many radiology tasks, there are actually more radiologists employed now than when Hinton made his prediction in 2016.\n\nHere are the killer stats, shared in this 2025 blog post that describes why radiologists are still in huge demand: In 2025, American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered a record 1,208 positions, a 4% increase from 2024, and the field's vacancy rates are at all-time highs. Also, in 2025, radiology was the second-highest-paid medical specialty in the country, with an average income of $520,000, over 48% percent higher than the average radiologist salary in 2015 (the year before Hinton's prediction).\n\nHow did this happen? Huang argued that the job's purpose isn't \"reading scans.\" Those are tasks that AI has automated. The true purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose disease, guide treatment, and support those efforts with research. When AI helps clinicians evaluate more images with higher confidence, hospitals can serve more patients, generate more revenue, and justify hiring more specialists.\n\nThe same logic, he said, applies across the economy.\n\n\"I spend most of my day typing,\" Huang noted, describing typing as a task, not his job's purpose. Tools that automate writing don't eliminate the need for executives; they often expand the amount of work leaders and other employees can take on, he said.\n\n\"The fact that somebody could use AI to automate a lot of my typing — I really appreciate that, and it helps a lot,\" he said. \"It hasn't really made me, if you will, less busy. In a lot of ways, I become more busy because I'm able to do more work.\"\n\nThis \"task versus purpose\" framework is increasingly visible in knowledge work, where AI tools are speeding up and automating tasks such as drafting, summarizing, and generating code.\n\nHuang pointed to software engineering as a case where AI can reduce time spent on a core task (writing code) while raising demand for the job's purpose: solving problems and identifying new ones worth solving.\n\nNvidia, he said, is hiring aggressively even as AI coding tools such as Cursor spread through the company's engineering teams, because productivity gains allow companies to pursue more ideas. That can boost revenue, leaving more money to hire new staff.\n\nLaw is another example he cited. Reading and drafting contracts are tasks, while the purpose of a lawyer is to protect clients and resolve disputes. AI can accelerate document-heavy work, but the role's true value relies on judgment, strategy, and accountability — and you need experienced, trustworthy human attorneys for that.\n\nThis even applies to waiters working in a restaurant. Their task is taking food orders, but their purpose is to ensure guests have a great time, Huang said.\n\n\"If some AI is taking the order or even delivering the food, their job is still helping us have a great experience,\" the CEO added. \"They would reshape their jobs accordingly.\"\n\nHuang's argument isn't that AI won't disrupt roles — it will. But he contends the early evidence points less toward a wholesale collapse of employment and more toward job redesign.\n\nFor workers, the implication is pragmatic: if your role is defined primarily by a repeatable task, AI is a direct threat. If it's anchored in outcomes — diagnosis, customer experience, problem-solving, conflict resolution — AI may be less a replacement than a lever, changing what you spend time on while keeping your job's purpose intact.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "I tried Amazon's Zoox. It's unlike any robotaxi out there.",
    "description": "Zoox's robotaxis do not have a steering wheel and are bi-directional. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee described the experience as like a theme park ride.",
    "fullText": "Of all the robotaxis I've tried, Amazon's Zoox feels different.\n\nZoox — founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon four years later — is a robotaxi company that has limited operations in Las Vegas and San Francisco with about 50 vehicles between the two major cities. The company has said Austin and Miami are next on the map.\n\nThe service is considerably smaller than its competitor, Waymo, and that limitation was acutely felt in my experience hailing a Zoox on a Thursday night in Las Vegas during the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nHowever, the rider experience itself felt more akin to an amusement-park-ride-slash-party-bus than an average ride-hail service in an everyday car, which makes Zoox a true differentiator against the emerging players in the robotaxi race.\n\nThe company doesn't bulk order vehicles from automakers to retrofit them with sensors the same way Waymo or Uber does. Instead, Zoox designed a vehicle solely for robotaxi operations and builds the cars out of a factory in Hayward, California.\n\nThe robotaxi doesn't have a steering wheel or brake pedal — only seats inside the vehicle. The car is also bi-directional, meaning the Zoox's \"front\" goes both ways.\n\nThis helps the vehicle navigate tight spaces and avoid the need to execute U-turns or three-point turns.\n\nHowever, riders will mainly feel the difference once they step inside the Zoox.\n\nA chime plays as the robotaxi's doors slide open — almost like a grand entrance to the Zoox experience.\n\nThe interior reminded me of one of those immersive Disneyland rides or even a party-themed Gondola lift.\n\nInside, there are four seats — two on each side of the car, facing each other. I found that it encourages a social experience if you're bringing along multiple riders.\n\nThe headliner — or the roof — of the robotaxi has starlights which reminded me of the inside a Rolls-Royce or limousine. That touch felt especially appropriate for the Vegas scene, but it also seemed to add to the overall social experience Zoox is going for. It feels like a party inside the car.\n\nSurprisingly, the seats were comfortable. The photos and videos I've seen of the Zoox made me think the seats would feel like a bus or subway seat, but they have a plush touch to them.\n\nI don't see myself falling asleep inside the vehicle, simply because you're forced to sit upright and can't lie back in the seats, but they're comfortable enough for a 30- to 45-minute ride.\n\nAnother surprise: There's plenty of leg room that provides enough space between you and another rider in front of you. I went on a Zoox ride with a company spokesperson facing me, and space was not an issue.\n\nI tried a Zoox facing forward and backward inside the car.\n\nThere have been some reports of riders feeling nauseous when they face backward. I didn't experience that, but that could just be unique to me.\n\nThe Zoox app tells riders which way to face if they are prone to motion sickness.\n\nOutside the flashy headliner, there's little else inside the car. There are four wireless phone chargers, two small armrests, and four touchscreens by each of the seats, which allow riders to control the cabin temperature, change the music, and call for rider support.\n\nZoox is in a pilot stage of its operation in Las Vegas, working with fewer than 50 robotaxis inside the city. The service is free for now and limited to a handful of preset destinations.\n\nI hailed a Zoox from one of the stops, the Luxor Hotel, and was given a 25-minute wait time. The real wait-time was 37 minutes.\n\nThose two factors alone — limited destinations and long wait times — make Zoox less of a serious choice for day-to-day travel and more like a novelty experience to try once.\n\nThe rider experience also has room for improvement.\n\nFor all the effort Zoox put into creating a social in-car experience, the company has yet to provide riders with the option to connect to their Spotify or Apple Music. For now, passengers hear a curated music service from Stingray Music — similar to an iHeartRadio program.\n\nThe ride itself was mostly smooth. There was one moment that stuck out while the Zoox was going down the Strip.\n\nTraffic was heavy at night, and the Zoox attempted to make a lane change while it was stopped behind a line of cars waiting at a red light.\n\nThe robotaxi began to move into the right lane, possibly to navigate around the traffic and transition to a less-congested lane. As it began to enter the right lane, with the body of the car now at a diagonal, the Zoox suddenly stopped. The car hesitated, lurched a little bit forward, and paused again. About 10 seconds later, the car straightened out and remained in the current lane.\n\nZoox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter a nearly 35-minute ride, I was dropped off at AREA15, a Vegas entertainment hub that was one of the closest stops to my hotel.\n\nA couple who had just taken a ride before me was trying to hail another Zoox to get back to their hotel at Excalibur.\n\nThe outside temperature was around 40 degrees.\n\nWe both resorted to calling an Uber.",

    "title": "I made a drastic career pivot at 27 and regretted it. Here are 3 things I wish I had done differently.",
    "description": "Justine Tello shares the lessons she learned from leaving public relations for teaching, then pivoting to running a small business with her spouse.",
    "fullText": "In July 2024, five years into my career, I made a drastic job switch that I would soon come to regret.\n\nFollowing about a year of disenchantment at my workplace, I left my job at a public relations agency to become a high school English teacher. I took a nearly 36% pay cut.\n\nI wasn't concerned about my paycheck because I desired a more meaningful and impactful role. I soon found myself underprepared and overwhelmed by the switch, and I left my teaching role after my first semester.\n\nAt first, I relied on my savings, my family's support, and my meager earnings as a part-time yoga teacher. My then-boyfriend and I got engaged and were married six months later.\n\nNow, we co-own a small HVAC and electrical company, where I lead the communications and marketing strategy.\n\nI loved getting to know the students and having the opportunity to mentor some of them. I learned many new skills while preparing lessons and grading papers.\n\nWhen it came to my career and my goals, the position didn't align with what I had historically wanted, and I didn't accept the job with a strategy in mind — I accepted it to pursue something new, whether I was prepared for it or not.\n\nTruthfully, I switched careers because I was dissatisfied with my original place of work, feeling stagnant in my personal growth, and lacking interest in my clients' missions. Instead of reframing my perspective or setting a new career goal, I sought a quick escape.\n\nAfter a year of reflection, I've identified three crucial mistakes that led to my unsatisfying career change.\n\nIn my final year at my PR agency, I found myself more easily discouraged by problems that were smaller than I initially perceived, or by those that had been resolved yet still lingered in my mind, like a delayed promotion, company layoffs, and a dissonant relationship with a supervisor.\n\nThese were challenging, but for the most part, I believe that the company and my managers handled problems well, and things began to smooth out over time.\n\nUnfortunately, my attitude toward my workplace remained negative after a handful of poor, back-to-back experiences. Although I was working with several amazing team members and continued to take on tasks I enjoyed, my dissatisfaction with my workplace persisted.\n\nI was burned out and a little lonely. I had been working remotely for over four years, which takes a toll on an extrovert like me, despite spending many evenings and weekends with friends and family. I longed for a position that included in-person connections, and I latched onto the idea that I could only solve my issues by switching to a new workplace.\n\nI halfheartedly applied to new PR jobs, but nothing panned out. I applied for a position as a high school English teacher on the recommendation of a family member, not because teaching was my ultimate passion, but because people are, and it felt like a way to contribute something meaningful.\n\nThe offer letter was framed as a call to something greater, and it felt like I would be filling a role that desperately needed someone. While I longed to have a positive impact on their lives, I also felt an obligation to accept the position.\n\nIf I could step back in time to the middle of my discontent in my PR role, I would try to reframe my perspective and approach my job with a different attitude. Every job can be impactful and meaningful if approached with the perspective of doing your best for yourself and for others.\n\nIf I still found my PR job no longer a fit and longed to have a greater impact on the world, the next step shouldn't have been to bail, but rather to determine clear career goals that aligned with my personal values and mission.\n\nI tried to pursue a shiny, new calling rather than develop a solid career plan. It didn't work out because I gave significant weight to one over the other, but the two can fit hand in hand.\n\nIt's better to approach a career change intentionally and with an overarching goal, rather than latching onto a new idea and pursuing it blindly. Oftentimes, it's frightening to define our goals and a solid plan, because we feel that once we decide on a direction, we can never change our path. That's inaccurate.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would've drawn up a clear plan — perhaps including multiple potential pathways — before switching fields. If the desire to teach high school English was lying dormant somewhere inside my heart, it surely would've made itself known in a new-career-ideas brainstorm.\n\nI would recommend that anyone looking to discover their true passion or calling jot down a mix of their skills and interests, and then research which jobs align with both. If a new career of interest arises, pursue it intentionally by identifying existing or gaining new relevant experience and by connecting with people in the field.\n\nI quit my teaching role because of long work hours, emotional exhaustion, and a sense that I was operating in a silo. A few other teachers occasionally offered me encouragement or advice, but I was still required to create curricula from scratch and develop my lessons on my own.\n\nWhile I would like to change some of my past career choices, I don't regret the lessons I learned and the students and coworkers I met.\n\nI'm grateful to have had the opportunity to discover more about myself through this process — to see where I can change my attitude, set new goals, and achieve greater things in the future. Every failure is a learning experience, and I'll try to make this one count.",

A 2018 analysis showed its five-star stocks crushed those it rated lower.\n\nThe firm said a five-star rating means that: \"We believe appreciation beyond a fair risk-adjusted return is highly likely over a multiyear time frame. Our analysis indicates that the current market price represents an excessively pessimistic outlook, which limits downside risk and maximizes upside potential.\"\n\nMorningstar's price-to-fair value ratio for each stock is also included.

    "title": "Goldman Sachs is crushing it",
    "description": "Strong earnings, rising shares, and a bet on AI are converging at a pivotal moment for Goldman Sachs after riding out ups and downs.",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs is acting like Goldman Sachs again.\n\nThe Wall Street giant is coming off one of its best years on record, its share price is through the roof, and its executives are downright giddy over its swelling deal pipeline. Equity trading is booming, and dealmaking is thriving ahead of what could be one of the biggest years for IPOs of all time, big boons for Goldman's bottom line.\n\nIf the bank had lost its luster, CEO David Solomon seems to have gotten it back. Goldman is once again Wall Street's top dog. It's a swift comeback for a firm that some declared dead as recently as 2023. The scars of an internal PR crisis and concerns over Solomon's DJ side hustle are long in the past. Goldman is on the attack again as it readies for a monster year.\n\n\"I think the world is set up at the moment to be incredibly constructive in 2026 for M&A and capital markets activity,\" Solomon told an analyst. \"The 2021 levels will be exceeded again. They might be exceeded in 2026.\"\n\nBeing on the right footing is all the more important as other banks are jockeying for some of the industry's hottest deals too. In a memo to her staff on Wednesday, Citi CEO Jane Fraser warned her staff against settling for second best.\n\n\"The animal spirits have been unleashed,\" veteran Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo told Business Insider last week, noting competition among the banks is now \"at its most intense level since before the global financial crisis.\"\n\nHere's how Goldman got its swagger back and what's still at stake.\n\nMuch of Solomon's vision that's playing out today dates back to a 2020 investor day just a few weeks before the coronavirus pandemic sent the world into a tailspin. At the presentation — which featured a number of then-Goldman officials who are no longer at the bank — its leaders teased two pursuits that would go on to shape its future: \"digitization\" and \"consumerization.\"\n\nNot everything went according to plan.\n\nIts consumer banking venture, Marcus, proved a costly distraction that fomented schisms among power brokers and sent some partners to the exits. Stephanie Cohen, the bank's former chief strategy officer and an architect of its consumer strategy, left the firm in 2024 to go to the tech sector.\n\nThe bank retreated from many of its consumer ambitions due to ballooning spending, but the Marcus brand lives on as a deposits platform within its combined asset and wealth management business. Marcus holds more than $100 billion in consumer deposits in the US and UK, contributing to more than $500 billion in deposits overall, the bank has said.\n\nThe bank also got closure on another Marcus venture this week. It has relinquished its Apple Card partnership to JPMorgan. A silver lining for the bank is that this transfer meant analysts didn't pepper Solomon with questions about President Donald Trump's 10% credit card interest proposal. Other CEOs had to address it point-blank during their earnings calls.\n\nAside from the consumer flop, other initiatives stuck. Solomon merged the asset and wealth businesses in late 2022. The gambit appears to have paid off — the business' assets under supervision climbed nearly half a trillion dollars to $3.6 trillion last year, an all-time high, alongside investments in private banking, alternatives, and wealth management in the high-net-worth category.\n\nAbout a year ago, Goldman formalized its Capital Solutions Group, coalescing its advisory, financing, structuring, and risk-management capabilities. The unit's primary objective is helping corporate clients navigate increasingly bespoke capital needs at a time when liquidity demands are skyrocketing.\n\nThe consumer banking misfire fueled multiple years of unrest from 2022 to 2024.\n\nAt times, the infighting spilled into public view, with some frustrated partners turning to reporters to get the CEO's attention. Some who worked directly with Solomon bristled over a management style they said could be abrasive and alienating; he, in turn, told veteran journalist Bethany McLean that internal leaks were \"damaging the firm.\" Those familiar with Goldman's closely guarded mystique were surprised at the spillover at the time, saying it conflicted with the bank's pristine image.\n\nTensions resurfaced almost two years ago, when questions about the advancement of women at Goldman were thrust to the center stage following a critical Wall Street Journal report. Business Insider later revealed talking points the firm circulated to managers to quell concerns from within its own walls, acknowledging that the issue had become a flashpoint.\n\nEven so, Solomon and his deputy, President and COO John Waldron, kept moving — and the bank continues to draw hopefuls at scale.\n\nMore than a million people applied for jobs at the bank last year, Solomon said, and its ultra-exclusive internship acceptance was less than 1%.\n\nWith the business stabilized, Goldman is focused on its next chapter, and chatter surrounding Solomon has died down. Last year, the bank awarded both Solomon and Waldron $80 million in restricted stock units to vest over five years, signaling it doesn't want the duo going anywhere.\n\nLast year, it acquired the ETF platform, Innovator; the VC firm Industry Ventures; and partnered with T. Rowe Price. In the fall, the firm rolled out One Goldman Sachs 3.0, an AI-driven overhaul of an internal operating model designed to unify business lines, cross-sell products, and foster company cohesion.\n\nIt's pouring billions into the development of technology — Solomon has said he wishes his $6 billion tech budget was higher — and deployment of artificial intelligence to supercharge the bank's workers and cut costs.\n\nBut the road ahead is never certain. Goldman has stumbled on high-profile tech initiatives before, and executives have acknowledged that changing how a 150-year-old institution works is neither quick nor easy. Pressed by Mayo for more specifics on what Goldman's AI investments will entail, Solomon sought to reassure listeners that the firm is taking a measured approach.\n\n\"This is not a new era for Goldman Sachs,\" he said. Goldman, he added, remains focused on its two core businesses — its global banking and markets franchise, and its asset and wealth management unit — with AI serving as an accelerant.\n\n\"It's not just to take cost out,\" Solomon said. \"It's to free up capacity to invest in other areas where we see growth opportunities that we've been a little bit constrained.\"\n\nAfter the ups and downs of the first half of the decade, Solomon is poised to enter the second half with the wind at his back and his hands held tightly to one of Wall Street's most feared and coveted thrones. Partners, shareholders, journalists, and rivals will be watching closely to see where he steers Goldman next.",

    "title": "Is Trader Joe's actually healthier than other grocery stores? We put 12 products to the test.",
    "description": "We compared the nutritional content of Trader Joe's popular snacks with similar products from large supermarkets.",
    "fullText": "Trader Joe's has a reputation as a \"healthier\" grocery store — fewer additives, quirky private labels, smaller ingredient lists.\n\nThe store chain says it's committed to using only natural ingredients in its private-label foods, including no artificial dyes, no MSG, and no high-fructose corn syrup.\n\nDoes that actually translate into meaningfully healthier food?\n\nWe put that reputation to the test by comparing 12 Trader Joe's own-brand products with similar products from Stop & Shop and the northeast chain Foodtown.\n\nTo craft this head-to-head comparison, we selected similar products, such as vanilla ice cream, sandwich cookies, and frozen pizzas. We did not measure long-term health outcomes or blood biomarkers; instead, we focused on the sodium, added sugar, and saturated fat content of each product.\n\nAll the products we looked at were ultraprocessed foods (UPFs), meaning foods that are broken down from their fresh or whole form and treated with additives, thickeners, and colors.\n\nTrader Joe's had one big advantage over its competition: its famously low prices.\n\nBrownie Truffle Baking Mix: Less total sugar and sodium; uses unbleached flour\n\nIn our head-to-head competition, Trader Joe's slightly edges out competitors across some factors, but not by much.\n\nAll of these examples are ultraprocessed foods. As a result, most of the product differences were minimal.\n\nWhen comparing similar products, Trader Joe's versions often had similar (or even identical) caloric, sugar, and fat content.\n\nIn some cases, Trader Joe's had slightly less sodium, such as its Joe-Joe's or Cookie Butter. That wasn't always the case — its White Cheddar Corn Puffs had more sodium than the Pirate's Booty version.\n\nIt's important to remember that small nutritional differences rarely outweigh overall dietary patterns. Maddie Pasquariello, a registered dietitian, told Business Insider that if you're mostly cooking meals from whole foods, being mindful of your sodium intake, and eating minimal UPFs, you don't need to fixate on ultraprocessed labels so much.\n\n\"My ethos with nutrition is that if you're going to have the chips or the brownie, have them,\" she said. \"It can be fun to seek out healthier versions of your favorite foods from time to time, but I don't think you need to treat your whole diet like this.\"\n\nIn our comparison, we looked at how many ingredients each product had, and which of those ingredients were additives: ingredients which, in some cases, may be used to bind an ultraprocessed food together.\n\nTo be clear, ingredients like riboflavin (vitamin B2) or ascorbic acid (derived from vitamin C) are not harmful on their own; they are essential nutrients. The issue isn't their presence; it's what their presence often signals about how much a food has been processed.\n\nThese compounds are often added back to foods after processing to stabilize texture, prevent spoilage, and replace nutrients lost during refining. They can be a sign that the original food structure has been compromised during processing, stripping away fiber and micronutrients that contribute to the food's texture and flavor. Additives are used to make packaged products palatable and shelf-stable again.\n\nAdditives alone aren't what make UPFs less nutritious, Pasquariello said. What matters more is the overall macronutrient profile — how much protein or fiber the food has, if at all — and how palatable the food is.\n\n\"That is, how likely you are to overeat it,\" she said. \"Many UPFs are highly palatable, making it more likely that you over-consume them.\"\n\nResearch links ultraprocessed foods to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and weight gain, among other health issues. These risks show up across brands, including the ones advertising \"all-natural\" ingredients.\n\nTrader Joe's often wins on price, sometimes dramatically. Its Pretzel Slims, frozen pizza, and frozen butter chicken were all about half the price of its competitors' products.\n\nIt also stood out in its marketing. Pasquariello said a lot of brands put labels like \"low-calorie,\" \"high in fiber,\" \"good source of,\" and \"organic\" on their packaging, which she \"ultimately ignores\" until she's read the label. Overall, Trader Joe's marketing was simpler, with fewer health claims on the packaging.\n\nThe only caveat was its serving sizes: On some products, like its Joe-Joe's, Trader Joe's used a smaller serving size than its competitor, making it appear overall lower in calories or fat.\n\nBased on this ad-hoc comparison, Trader Joe's foods are sometimes marginally better than other brands in terms of sodium levels. Often, its packaged snacks are nutritionally similar to those found at other major supermarkets.\n\nUltimately, snacks are still snacks and should be eaten in moderation. The biggest health gains come from minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.\n\nIf you're eating all that, choosing between a Joe-Joe and an Oreo comes down to preference.\n\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson from Trader Joe's shared the following, which has been edited for length:\n\n\"Trader Joe's-branded products promise great quality for exceptional, everyday prices. At Trader Joe's, value lies at the intersection of top quality and great price. We taste everything before we put our name on it and offer only what we feel is extraordinary. We are grateful to each customer who chooses to shop in our stores and value the trust they place in our brand every time they shop.\"",

    "fullText": "Reid Hoffman loves AI. So much so that, for Christmas, instead of fuzzy socks or wool sweaters, he gave his friends and family an AI music album.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder and Greylock partner, who Forbes estimates has a $2.5 billion net worth, recently told Wired he generated silly Christmas songs using AI and pressed them onto records.\n\n\"There's a song on ugly sweaters and all of this kinda stuff,\" he said. \"As opposed to the 'Holly, Jolly Christmas,' you know, something that actually has some humor. Almost like what 'Weird Al' Yankovic would do if he was doing a Christmas album.\"\n\nTo create the Christmas music, Hoffman said he used two different AI agents: one to write the lyrics and another to compose the music.\n\nIt's not clear which AI tool Hoffman used to generated the songs. His current firm, Greylock, doesn't list any of the major music-generating apps — like Suno, Udio, or AIVA — in its investment portfolio.\n\nBut, whichever tool he used, Hoffman said he was impressed by the result.\n\nHe said he told everyone who received the gift that it was AI, but when he played it for his wife, she couldn't tell it was computer-generated.\n\nThe Christmas surprise comes as Hoffman has been talking about AI while promoting a new book published with journalist Greg Beato titled \"Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future.\"\n\nIn it, the two argue that AI doesn't need to be a dystopian technology destined to displace workers or lead to human extinction, as some more pessimistic about the technology have warned.\n\nHoffman argues that AI skeptics are falling into the same trap that has gripped tech cynics in the past, including existential complaints during the rollouts of the printing press, electricity, and the internet.\n\n\"My push for people is if you are not using AI in a way today that isn't seriously helpful to you, you are not actually trying hard enough,\" he told Wired. \"Now, of course it'll transform jobs, and there'll be a bunch of pain in that transformation. But the way that you as an individual can avoid that is to be engaged.\"",

    "description": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson said AI isn't going away, but it's not quite at the level it needs to be to bring about major changes.",
    "fullText": "Tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson says he's hopeful about AI in the long term, but right now, he's just not seeing enough to meaningfully change his approach.\n\n\"I feel like it's a little bit like a flickering light bulb,\" Hansson said during a recent episode of \"Next Token.\" \"You're in total darkness and then it'll flicker on and you go like, 'I can see everything.' And then two seconds later, boom, pitch black.\"\n\nHansson said when he asked AI to write lines of code, the output is not \"as good as a job as most junior programmers I've had to deal with.\"\n\n\"I'm not feeling that we're falling behind at 37 Signals in terms of our ability to produce, in terms of our ability to launch things or improve the products,\" he said. \"And this is why I'm a little skeptical about the claims that AI is already now at a place where you can take your standard SaaS business and then fire half the programmers and still go faster.\"\n\nHumans coded 95% of the code for Fizzy, 37 Signals' Kanban-inspired organization product, Hansson said. They've experienced with AI-powered features for the product, but for now, they've ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nHansson said he doesn't see his business losing ground because he's focusing on writing his own code. For the time being, he can still \"care about the beauty of it.\"\n\n\"That's a luxury that perhaps is akin to what a modern saddle maker enjoys when you go, \"Oh, the letter's just right, and the stitching is just right.' And you're like, 'Okay, but you're no longer part of the main production for transportation,'\" he said. \"And I'm like, 'Well, so what?' I'll continue to make my handwritten code saddles as long as I can for my enjoyment.\"\n\nAlternatively, Hansson said he's seen the promise of AI in the type of tools Shopify uses, where he serves on the board.\n\n\"Some of the things that they've done with SiteKick, the AI agent they have helping merchants set up their shop and optimize their shop is truly incredible,\" he said. \"And there's some real tangible benefits in that that I think are undisputable.\"\n\nOverall, Hansson said he's excited about the promise of a new era that could upend development, just as the iPhone's 2007 release ushered in a focus on mobile optimization.\n\n\"This is the first one where we, in real time, know the world is going to look totally different, and we don't know what the final result is going to be,\" he said. \"So I think the best thing you can just do is accept that A, we don't know, B, that it's really exciting, and C, just try to hold onto your hat, jump on there cowboy and ride it and see where it goes.\"\n\nHe also said AI isn't going away, no matter what some people may hope.\n\n\"That power does not exist. You don't get to roll these things back. Now, you could personally choose that you're not going to use gen AI,\" he said, adding that some people may also try to avoid buying products that were aided by AI.\n\nHansson said he's amazed by just how much of the US economy is based on large bets that AI will break through its current limitations and reach something akin to Artificial General Intelligence, the theoretical moment where AI reaches capabilities akin to humans.\n\n\"The entire American economy right now is one big bet that that's going to happen,\" he said. \"And I, as AI positive as I am, still marvel at that. The conviction of an entire economy to just combined go like 'Whatever takes 100 trillion, a thousand trillion. I don't care. We will get there.' I go like, 'That's why America is fucking number one.'\"",

    "title": "A leading European AI startup says its edge over Silicon Valley isn't better tech — it's not being American",
    "description": "Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch said European governments and firms want AI they can control, deploy locally, and run independently of US tech giants.",
    "fullText": "As the race to dominate AI accelerates, Europe's most prominent AI startup is betting that geography — not just technology — can be a competitive advantage in its home market.\n\nArthur Mensch, the CEO and cofounder of French AI company Mistral, said the company's edge in Europe over Silicon Valley rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic isn't about having dramatically smarter models.\n\nInstead, he said that many European governments and regulated enterprises are seeking AI systems they can control, customize, and operate independently, rather than relying on a small number of external providers.\n\n\"European governments are coming to us because they want to build the technology and they want to serve their citizens,\" Mensch said on the \"Big Technology Podcast\" on Wednesday.\n\nMistral, founded in 2023 and now valued at roughly $14 billion, develops large language models that rival those of leading US systems.\n\nBut Mensch said that frontier AI models are rapidly converging in performance as research spreads and training techniques become widely available.\n\nAs a result, the real battleground is shifting away from raw intelligence and toward deployment, control, and trust — a shift that plays directly into Mistral's pitch in Europe.\n\nMensch said governments, banks, and heavily regulated industries want AI systems they can customize, deploy locally, and operate independently — without fear that a single vendor could change the rules or shut off access.\n\nThe approach has already paid off. France's military recently selected Mistral for an AI deal that keeps sensitive systems running on French-controlled infrastructure.\n\nMensch pushed back on the idea that the company benefits merely from EU regulation or protectionism.\n\nInstead, he framed the demand as geopolitical and operational.\n\nEuropean governments, he said, want AI that they can govern themselves and use to serve citizens without depending on foreign platforms.\n\nThe same logic applies to regulated enterprises that need tighter control over data, compliance, and security.\n\nMistral's embrace of open-source models is central to that strategy.\n\nOpen source allows customers to run AI on their own infrastructure, build redundancy, and avoid vendor lock-in — a sharp contrast to the closed, centralized platforms favored by many US firms.\n\nThe appeal isn't limited to Europe. Mensch said Mistral also works with US and Asian customers who want to reduce dependence on a small group of American providers and retain more autonomy over how AI is used inside their organizations.\n\nThat approach is already extending beyond the West. Mistral recently deepened a partnership with Morocco's government to co-build locally tailored AI models and launch a joint research and development lab aimed at strengthening the country's technological autonomy.\n\nLong term, Mensch said he doesn't believe AI will be dominated by a single winner or country. Instead, he expects multiple regional centers of expertise shaped by local needs, industries, and political realities.\n\nIn that future, he suggested, Mistral's biggest advantage may not be the models it builds — but where, and how, it builds them.\n\nDo you work for Mistral and have a tip or story to share?

    "description": "Cisco's chief people officer said when the company finds top-tier talent, executives like Jeetu Patel call them up.",
    "fullText": "Specialized AI talent can be hard to come by — and companies are jockeying to scoop them up.\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing battle for elite talent, Cisco's chief people officer says that AI and machine-learning operations positions are \"really hard\" to fill at the company.\n\n\"The qualified pool is so small, and the demand is so high,\" Jones said.\n\nPart of that is because \"everyone\" is currently hiring for those positions right now. She said that every forward-thinking organization needs AI in its products and also in its internal IT teams.\n\nThose jobs also require a \"slightly different level of specialization,\" she said. AI and ML Ops roles typically involve automating and streamlining IT operations, the company said. The strongest candidates are those with experience working in AI, ML, and operations, and those who have a track record of developing successful products.\n\n\"We're looking for people who have done this, who have been there, and have a good story to tell,\" Jones said, adding that she wants to know about what they built.\n\nAs the AI talent wars continue, Jones said that one factor that makes a \"really big difference\" is having leaders at the company talk directly to talent. She said that shouldn't reflect negatively on recruiters, but in the current landscape, there's \"a lot of AI washing going on,\" which makes it hard to differentiate the real wins.\n\n\"Companies are talking about all these things they're doing and how they're slapping AI on everything,\" Jones said. \"But they're actually not doing interesting things with work or with products.\"\n\nShe said mobilizing executives like Cisco's president and chief product officer, Jeetu Patel, has helped score some of those top candidates. She said when the company has a strong AI candidate, he'll pick up the phone and give them a call.\n\n\"If there's someone that we are really strategically trying to hire, we will get him involved,\" Jones said.\n\nPatel, whom the company poached from Box in 2020, understands the connection between having the best people design products and the success of those products, Jones said.\n\nCisco isn't the only company to use this technique. Citadel CTO Umesh Subramanian recently told Business Insider that he personally calls top entry-level candidates during the hiring process to talk through their decision-making.\n\nOpenAI's Sam Altman has also reportedly called candidates to convince them to join the AI company, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously appeared in email chains to recruit talent and has also reportedly hosted top candidates at his home for meals.\n\nWhat qualifies a candidate to get a phone call from Cisco's Patel?\n\nAside from \"top-tier\" technical skills and experience, Jones assesses for behavior and potential when evaluating top talent. She said, \"It's not just about skills,\" because those can be learned, but also about the leadership characteristics an applicant has.\n\n\"We want to know, not only have you done these things, but are you intellectually curious? Are you intellectually and emotionally agile? Are you someone who brings your team along with you?\" Jones said.\n\nJones said that the company also has to put its efforts toward \"naturally\" attracting talent both online and in person by creating a presence in the tech community. She said that includes having senior leaders connect with talent at industry events and building community through channels like its Tech Pulse newsletter, which highlights Cisco's leadership in the AI era.\n\nIt also involves leaders sharing career opportunities on LinkedIn and participating in events with entry talent recruiting to engage with the next generation of AI professionals, the company said.\n\n\"We've tried to insert ourselves into not just your typical talent branding, but going where that talent lives — in the forums that they're on, in the hobbies that they have, to ensure that we have a presence there,\" Jones said.",

    "fullText": "Longevity and biohacking have become synonymous with the tech world, but an obsession with physical fitness wasn't always the norm in Silicon Valley, according to one CEO.\n\nBrian Chesky, the 44-year-old cofounder and CEO of Airbnb, said he felt like his interest in bodybuilding made him stand out when he first arrived in the late 2000s, and not in a good way.\n\nWhen asked about the latest peptide craze during a \"TBPN\" livestream on Wednesday, Chesky said he'd been slightly surprised to see the way the tech community has embraced fitness.\n\n\"When I came to Silicon Valley, I was slightly self-conscious about wearing long-sleeve shirts because I thought if I wear a short-sleeve shirt, people will think I'm a meathead and therefore an idiot,\" he told the \"TBPN\" hosts. \"People just didn't really lift weights in 2007, 2008.\"\n\nBefore starting Airbnb, Chesky played hockey in college and was a competitive bodybuilder, an interest he said got sparked after an injury sent him to physical therapy.\n\nHe told the podcast hosts he was excited to see more people embracing fitness and following the science on nutrition and weightlifting. He also said that many of the things he learned through bodybuilding, he brought with him to Silicon Valley.\n\n\"You don't get in shape in one workout. It's 1% a day,\" he said. Likewise, in Silicon Valley, \"It's not about one idea. It's about grinding every single day year-over-year with consistency,\" he said. \"Overnight successes take thousands of days, actually, typically.\"\n\nChesky also discussed Airbnb's announcement on Wednesday that Ahmad Al-Dahle, formerly head of generative AI at Meta, was joining the company as CTO. Chesky has previously shared his plan for Airbnb to become an AI-first app.\n\nOn the \"TBPN\" livestream, the topic of fitness initially came up after co-host John Coogan said, \"The chat is begging us to ask you for an arm routine.\"\n\nChesky, wearing a black, fitted, short-sleeve shirt, delivered.\n\n\"Genetically, I have better arms than shoulders or chests,\" the CEO said, adding he doesn't have a dedicated arm day and instead does arms with shoulders.\n\nChesky said he usually does two bicep exercises and two tricep exercises, \"typically a compound free weight movement and a machine movement.\" For example, he said his bicep workout might include a dumbbell curl followed by a Hammer Strength cable exercise with a rope or V bar, while his tricep workout includes a cable pushdown and maybe a skull crusher.\n\nWhen asked if he's using AI in the gym, Chesky said he has a personal trainer — a former Mr. Universe — for his workouts, but that he is using AI for nutrition and supplements.\n\nHe said he got bloodwork done and then uploaded the PDF to an AI chatbot to analyze it. He realized he was short on Vitamin D, so he started supplementing it.\n\nFar from being out of place these days, the marriage of tech and fitness only appears to be growing, with major AI companies expanding into healthcare and tech billionaires going all in on longevity.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge in Minnesota on Thursday ordered the release of a Liberian man four days after heavily armed immigration agents broke into his home using a battering ram and arrested him.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan said in his ruling that the agents violated Garrison Gibson’s Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.\n\n“To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.’s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,” he said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been ramping up immigration arrests in Minnesota in what the department has called its largest enforcement operation. DHS says its officers have arrested more than 2,500 people since Nov. 29.\n\nMarc Prokosch, Gibson’s attorney, said he was “thrilled” by the judge's order. He had filed a habeas corpus petition, used by courts to determine if an imprisonment is legal, and called the arrest a “blatant constitutional violation\" since the agents did not have a proper warrant.\n\nGibson’s wife was inside their Minneapolis home with the couple’s 9-year-old child during the raid. Prokosch said she was deeply shaken by the arrest.\n\nGibson, 37, was being held at an immigration detention center in Albert Lea after being held at a large camp on the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas, according to ICE’s detainee locator.\n\nDHS did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on the order and has not responded to a prior email with follow-up questions about Gibson’s case.\n\nGibson, who fled the Liberian civil war as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed by the courts. He had remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.\n\nOnly days before his arrest, Gibson had checked in with immigration authorities at regional immigration offices — the same building where agents have been staging enforcement raids in recent weeks.\n\nBryan said in his Thursday order that he agrees with Gibson's assertions that since he had already been released on an order of supervision, officials “violated applicable regulations” by not giving him enough notice that it had been revoked and the reasoning, as well as not providing him an interview right after he was detained.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, had said that Gibson has “a lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.” She did not indicate if those were arrests, charges or convictions.\n\nCourt records indicate Gibson’s legal history shows only the one felony in 2008, along with a few traffic violations, minor drug arrests and an arrest for riding public transportation without paying the fare.\n\nThe Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement campaign — has been wracked by fear and anger in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, who was shot Jan. 7 during a confrontation with agents. On Wednesday, a man was shot and wounded by an immigration officer who had been attacked with a shovel and broom handle.",

Look at this vehicle, look at what it says: It says ‘F ICE.’ You have these individuals who are putting their middle finger -- proudly so -- at the camera,” Leavitt said.\n\n“People don’t do this without encouragement from people in power who make it feel like it’s O.K.,” the press secretary continued.\n\nTrump critics raised their eyebrows over Leavitt’s remarks, sharing photos of the president giving the middle finger.\n\n“Who wants to tell her?” said liberal influencer Joanne Carducci, who tweets under the name JoJoFromJerz.\n\n“This is so rich given her boss did the exact same thing this week. Oh wait, but that was ‘an appropriate response,’ coming from the President,” tweeted another X user. “The hypocrisy and gaslighting with these people is so off the charts that I think they’re starting to truly believe their own lies.”\n\nOf Leavitt, another user said, “Is she this braindead?”\n\nThe White House press secretary addressed the media hours after Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to quell the protests.\n\n“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump stated in a post on his Truth Social profile.\n\nThe Insurrection Act of 1807, which authorizes the president to deploy the U.S. military in America in response to domestic unrest, was last used by then-President George H.W.

    "description": "Nvidia could face the risk of ceding its software edge if it loses the China market.",
    "fullText": "Nvidia's (NVDA) China business continues to face geopolitical hurdles, which could pose longer-term competitive risks for the AI chipmaker.\n\nOngoing US-China tensions have upended Nvidia’s sales in what was one of its largest markets. In the company’s most recent quarter, revenue from China, which includes Hong Kong, dropped 45% from a year ago to about $3 billion, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nAnd while the Trump administration green-lighted the sale of Nvidia’s H200 chip to China this week, albeit with a 25% tax, Reuters reported that China is barring imports of the GPUs except in special cases.\n\nSo far, Nvidia's dominant position in the chip market doesn't appear to have suffered much after the company initially lost access to the Chinese AI market in 2025. It became the first company with a $5 trillion valuation last fall. Despite a decline in China sales, its third quarter revenue overall soared more than 60% during the period to about $57 billion.\n\nBut over the long term, the Chinese commercial sector’s development and use of domestic chips could narrow Nvidia’s lead on the global stage, Wall Street analysts told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThey said Nvidia's dominance in AI software could suffer if Chinese tech developers begin making advances in open source alternatives, which would hurt its leadership in hardware as well.\n\n“That's the real nightmare scenario,” Seaport analyst Jay Goldberg said.\n\nMuch of Nvidia’s competitive edge comes from its software stack. Developers using its AI systems rely on the company’s CUDA platform, which includes a library of proprietary tools that lets them program its GPUs efficiently and reinforces the company’s dominance in the chip market.\n\nAs companies build on CUDA, the cost of switching to a new software platform becomes disadvantageous, and they end up sticking with Nvidia’s offerings, which are only available if developers are programming on Nvidia's GPUs. Hence, the preference for Nvidia's software is key to maintaining its lead in the hardware space.\n\nWhile China’s chip suppliers — from tech giants Huawei and Alibaba (BABA) to newly public players such as Moore Threads and MetaX — lag Nvidia in the performance capabilities of their chips, there’s a risk that the country’s AI developers, forced to use those inferior, domestically-produced chips, will build their own open-source software. Open-source AI software is typically written to run on many different types of chips.",

    "fullText": "In a lot of retail areas, there seem to be two clear-cut market leaders, and most people have a favorite.\n\nYou might prefer Lowe's over Home Depot, or Sam's Club over Costco.\n\nThe same logic applies to food. Some people are diehard Hostess fans, while others ride or die with Little Debbie.\n\nIn some areas, these choices can be polarizing and divisive. One person might be all in on the Big Mac, while their partner greatly prefers the Whopper.\n\nThe most polarizing battle, however, might be the choice between Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\nBoth companies have made public claims to be better than the other, and each one has restaurants and other partners such as theme parks, movie theaters, and arenas under exclusive deals.\n\nWhen a brand switches from Coke to Pepsi or vice versa, it's going to anger some customers, and that's exactly what Costco has done in its food court. The warehouse club has switched back to Coca-Cola products from PepsiCo brands.\n\nBecause Coke and Pepsi both have a large fan base, switching can anger some customers.\n\nI experienced a similar reaction last year aboard Carnival Celebration when the cruise line switched from Pepsi products to Coca-Cola mid-sailing. As inventory ran out, Coke fans hunted for remaining Coke products, while Pepsi drinkers searched for the last Mountain Dew and Pepsi, highlighting how emotionally charged soda loyalty can be.\n\nCostco rolled out the change toward the end of 2025 and finished swapping Pepsi products for Coca-Cola brands in the beginning of 2026.\n\nThat's not something Costco has commented on extensively, but CEO Ron Vachris addressed it during the question-and-answer session of the retailer's annual meeting.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n“Yes, that is accurate,” Vachris said. “This summer, we will begin converting our food court fountain business back over to Coca-Cola.”\n\nCostco had been under an exclusive deal with Pepsi since 2013.\n\n\"Costco originally made the switch to Pepsi in 2013 as a cost-saving measure, in order to keep the price of their famous hot dog and soda combo at $1.50. At the time, Pepsi was offering Walmart a better pricing deal that Costco couldn’t match. When Costco asked Coke for the same pricing, Coke refused, leading Costco to pull all Coke products from their stores for an entire month,\" Costco Insider reported.",

    "title": "The Supreme Court Just Decided a Major Issue in Cases Like Renee Good’s Shooting—and Not How You Might Expect",
    "description": "Last week, Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a white mother of three, while she was in her SUV.",
    "fullText": "After federal agents killed an unarmed American citizen in broad daylight last week, high-ranking government officials rushed to defend the shooter, framed a mother’s attempt to escape an escalating confrontation as “domestic terrorism,” and blamed the victim for her own death. The killing of Renee Good is not just a failure of policing—the public response by those in power should alarm every American who believes that being frightened by armed agents and trying to drive away should not be a capital offense. Indeed, recent Supreme Court precedent illuminates why the shooting of Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross is not the case of self-defense that administration officials are suggesting. The totality of events—which has been the standard established by the court since 1989 and was reaffirmed just last year—suggests that it was not reasonable for Ross to shoot Good in the head as she was attempting to drive away from ICE agents trying to forcibly remove her from her car.\n\nLast week, Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, a white mother of three, while she was in her SUV, apparently attempting to leave a situation that was becoming increasingly hostile. In cellphone video of the incident, we can see two ICE agents exit a pickup truck and approach Good’s car. As one agent appears to reach through the driver’s open window and tries to open the door, Good slowly reverses, then turns towards the right and drives forward slowly, attempting to leave. At that moment, a third officer, who is standing in front of Good’s car, unholsters his gun and, while moving to the side of the vehicle, fires several shots inside, striking Good in the head. The car continues to move forward and crashes into a parked car. Good was pronounced dead shortly after.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the agent who shot Good, saying, “This was an act of domestic terrorism. ICE officers got stuck in the snow and were attempting to push out their vehicle when a woman attacked them.” President Donald Trump also weighed in immediately after the killing, writing on Truth Social, “The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense.” None of the videos that have emerged from the shooting show Good running over the agent or attacking agents prior to her death.\n\nGood was a U.S. citizen, and DHS has stated she was not a target of an ICE investigation. She was shot just blocks from her home.\n\nAnother video of the incident follows what happened before the agents approached Good’s SUV. In the video, Good extends her arm from the open driver’s window and makes the “Go ahead” signal to a pickup truck that has just pulled up and stopped a few feet from her car, right before ICE agents exited the vehicle. The footage suggests that Good was not attempting to block agents with her car, as some have claimed.\n\nA third video, taken from the cellphone of the agent who shot Good, features a smiling Good, with her car window rolled down, saying, “That’s fine, dude. I’m not mad at you.” It also shows a woman, later identified as Becca Good, Good’s wife, outside the car, filming the ICE agent. As the agent is filming the license plate of their car, Becca says, “That’s OK, we don’t change our plates every morning, just so you know. It’ll be the same plate when you come talk to us later.” A few seconds later, two agents approach the SUV, one trying to open the driver’s-side door, while yelling, “Get out of the fucking car!” Possibly frightened at what appears to be a hostile situation, Good puts the car in reverse, then drives forward. The camera suddenly points towards the sky, and we hear a thud. Three shots ring out, one immediately after the other. After that, we hear a male voice saying, “Fucking bitch.”\n\nThe government has claimed that the agent who shot Good was in fear for his life and was acting in self-defense. The videos illustrate something else: an avoidable tragedy. Again, recent Supreme Court precedent helps explain why.\n\nIn assessing whether a law enforcement agent’s use of deadly force was reasonable or excessive, the court this past summer rejected the 5th Circuit’s narrow “moment of threat” doctrine—which stated that the only thing that matters in determining whether an officer reasonably fears for their life in a use-of-force situation is the moment of the shooting itself—as inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment. The court, in Barnes v. Felix, rejected this narrow time-framing approach and repeated what it had held in Graham v. Connor: In assessing the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force, one must consider the totality of circumstances.\n\nMany of those defending the shooting appear to be focusing on the moment just before he fired the first shot. Applying a moment-of-threat approach to this shooting would require one to freeze-frame the video at the moment the officer was standing in front of Good’s car and saw it inching forward. Under such a cramped view of the incident, one might conclude that in that moment, the officer feared for his life and therefore needed to shoot to defend himself.\n\nIn contrast, if we broaden the time frame and consider that the agent put himself in front of the vehicle, that a smiling Good had, seconds earlier, told the agent, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you” and started to move her car forward only after other agents approached her vehicle, with one reaching in through the open window, trying to open the driver’s side door, and screaming for her to get out of the “fucking car,” the claim that the agent needed to shoot Good to save his life seems less plausible. That the agent was able to stay on his two feet, move to the side of the car, and fire two shots into the open driver’s-side window as Good was turning the SUV to the right and trying to drive away further undermines the claim that he acted in self-defense to neutralize an imminent threat to his life. The videos suggest that Good was simply trying to leave what was becoming an increasingly hostile situation, not purposely trying to hit the ICE agent who had dangerously put himself in front of her car.\n\nOne question the court left open in Barnes was whether it is appropriate to consider prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk of an encounter with a civilian turning deadly—something many have called “officer-created jeopardy.” It seems obvious that if one is applying a totality-of-the-circumstances approach, then prior conduct of law enforcement that increases the risk that the encounter will turn deadly is just part of the totality of the circumstances and ought to be part of the inquiry.\n\nSome have pointed out that putting oneself in front of a moving vehicle is not considered a wise police practice. Similarly, shooting into a moving vehicle is not considered a good police practice unless necessary to stop an armed or dangerous felon (neither of which accurately describes Good), because of the risk of injury to the occupant of the vehicle and nearby bystanders. Although the first shot appears to have gone through the car’s front windshield, the second and third shots seem to have been fired by the agent at Good’s head through the open driver’s-side window as she was trying to leave. The officer by that time was firing from the side of the vehicle, not shooting someone trying to run him over as has been claimed. If he simply wanted to stop the vehicle from escaping, why did he aim at the driver’s head rather than the tires of the SUV?\n\nIn discussing the shooting, Noem said, “Any loss of life is a tragedy, and I think all of us can agree that, in this situation, it was preventable,” suggesting it was Good’s own fault that she had been shot. Similarly, Vice President J.D. Vance has said that Good’s death was “a tragedy of her own making.” With these comments, Noem, Vance, and others defending the officer posit that if Good had simply followed orders and gotten out of the car, none of this would have happened.\n\nIronically, Good’s death was completely preventable, not because Good failed to comply with the order to exit her car but because the officer could have exercised restraint and refrained from shooting her. He had taken a video of her license plate number, so if the agency wanted to track her down, it could have done so later. When the agent fired two shots into the open driver’s-side window from the side of Good’s car, Good was not posing an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to him or any other agent. Good was not a violent felon trying to flee the scene of a crime. She was just trying to get home to her three kids in one piece.",

    "fullText": "Scottish Cup, fourth round: Dunfermline Athletic v Hibernian\n\nVenue: East End Park, Dunfermline Date: Saturday, 17 January Time: 12:30 GMT\n\nCoverage: Watch on BBC One Scotland & iPlayer, live text commentary on the BBC Sport website & app\n\nNeil Lennon says the death of his father in December meant losing his \"biggest influence\".\n\nThe Dunfermline Athletic manager will come up against his former club Hibernian in a Scottish Cup fourth-round tie on Saturday.\n\nLennon, who has also managed Celtic twice, said of his recent bereavement: \"It was huge. He was my father. He was my best friend. He was the biggest influence on my life.\n\n\"He was never any further than a phone call away. He enjoyed all the highs and supported all the lows. I couldn't have asked for a better guy than Gerry Lennon.\"\n\nLennon says he still misses his father \"awfully every day\".\n\n\"There'll be maybe 10,000 or 11,000 here on Saturday,\" Lennon said.\n\n\"He'd be loving it. 'Just go and do your stuff, son. Just trust your gut instinct.'\"\n\nLennon regards Saturday's match as \"a very old-fashioned sort of cup tie\".\n\n\"I don't think we could have got much better in terms of size, in terms of prestige, in terms of two sets of supporters to support traditionally big clubs,\" Lennon told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"I want them to turn up and play and compete and match Hibs and try to beat them. They'll think maybe we can get a run at this. But we want a run at it as well.\"\n\nHaving taken over at East End Park in March, Lennon steered the club clear of relegation trouble and the Pars are currently fifth in the Scottish Championship, three points off the play-off zone with a game in hand.\n\n\"We knew that promotion would probably be a bit of a long shot this year,\" Lennon said.\n\n\"We want to finish as high up the table as possible. We've developed and we've got some good assets in the team. We try to play a good style of football, good style of attacking football.\n\n\"[It's] a two, three-year sort of thing really to get out of this division. It's a tough division. There's only one place that guarantees an automatic promotion, which makes it even tougher.\"\n\nTop-flight match, Nygren & Leven in focus in Scottish Cup\n\nListen: Scottish Cup weekend preview\n\nLennon to miss Dunfermline game after death of father\n\nLooking back on his two and a half years as Hibs boss, Lennon regards himself \"fortunate\" for having had his time there.\n\nHe replaced Scottish Cup-winning manager Alan Stubbs and soon secured automatic qualification to the Premiership. Hibs then finished fourth in their first season back in the top flight.\n\n\"The club was psychologically in a good place, but they hadn't got out of the Championship,\" Lennon said of his 2016 summer arrival at Easter Road. \"So it was a bit of a sweep for them.\n\n\"I had a really good time and I also inherited a really good squad. I just felt that I needed to add a few bits and pieces to it to get out of the Championship.\n\n\"We did that, thankfully, and then we had a great season the following year where some of the football we played was something that I wanted to bring to the club because I always remember the Tony Mowbray era, the football that they played.\n\n\"So I think it's sort of in the DNA of the county to play that style of football. And I loved it. The crowds were packing in, home and away. We had the derbies, we went to Glasgow and won at Ibrox and beat Celtic and got a couple of semi-finals.\n\n\"We had a really good football team. It was just fantastic, very exciting. And I look back on it with a lot of fond memories, probably some of the happiest times in my managerial career anyway.\"\n\nLennon sees much to admire in the current Hibernian side.\n\n\"They've hit a really good form again, despite having a couple of players missing,\" he added.\n\n\"I can see similarities again coming through. Edinburgh football is on the up at the minute.\n\n\"Hearts on the up at the minute, Hibs not far behind. They had a great season last year. They are building a bit of momentum again.\"",

    "fullText": "New Orleans Saints kicker Charlie Smyth says he does not believe he has \"made it\" despite becoming an NFL starter this season.\n\nThe 24-year-old, from Mayobridge in Northern Ireland, made his regular season debut against the Miami Dolphins in November and was the Saints' kicker for the final six games of their campaign.\n\nHe made 12 of 16 field goals, with a long of 57 yards, for the side who missed the play-offs with a 6-11 record in the NFC South, while also adding all 13 extra points he attempted.\n\nThe former Gaelic footballer authored some memorable moments along the way, most notably when kicking the game-winner with six seconds remaining against the Carolina Panthers and later tying a franchise record with five field goals against the New York Jets.\n\nHaving originally joined the Saints' practice squad in 2024 as part of the NFL's international player pathway programme, he was elevated to the 53-man roster for the first time last month and rewarded with a new three-year contract.\n\nEven in an NFL season that featured 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers coming out of retirement five years after his last appearance, Smyth securing a starting role less than two years after his first game in the sport ranks as one of the most unlikely stories of the campaign.\n\nRather than embrace his newfound fame at the end of his rookie season, Smyth has already switched focus to ensuring he can have a long career in the sport.\n\n\"You come home and people nearly see you as someone different. People at home are bigging you up, but I'm not thinking I've made it, I haven't,\" he told the GAA Social, the BBC's Gaelic games podcast.\n\n\"I don't feel like people at home really understand the standards. If I want to keep my job, if I want to be an NFL kicker for as long as my right leg allows me to be, there's a standard where you need to be 85 to 90%, or really good in moments.\n\n\"I think I went 12 for 16 on the stats. That's not going to cut it long term.\"",

    "fullText": "Premiership clubs enter the Scottish Cup this weekend - and some of them are facing each other.\n\nHere are some of the names and games to look out for.\n\nOf the three all-top flight ties on Saturday, Falkirk's visit to Hearts (20:00 GMT) is the one that most captures the imagination.\n\nHearts are flying high at the top of the Premiership, six points clear of their nearest challengers after a hard-fought midweek win over St Mirren.\n\nDerek McInnes' side had an early exit from this season's Premier Sports Cup and will be eager to go far in the Scottish Cup, even more so with new signings in the door this month.\n\nAs for Falkirk, they ran Celtic close on Wednesday evening and the 1-0 defeat should not overly dampen what has been a fine campaign so far for John McGlynn's side.\n\nThe two league encounters between Hearts and Falkirk this season have both been won by Hearts and the Bairns are yet to score in the fixture this term.\n\nFalkirk won the last knock-out meeting between the two, 2-0 at home in the League Cup in August 2024, and also won on their visit to Tynecastle - 3-2 when both were in the Championship in January 2015.\n\nHowever, to prevail again they would have to end Hearts' 13-game unbeaten home run this season.\n\nBenjamin Nygren consolidated his status as Celtic's top scorer with the midweek winner against Falkirk.\n\nThe 24-year-old Sweden midfielder moved on to 12 goals this campaign, five more than last season's top marksman, Daizen Maeda.\n\nNygren has proved to be a versatile option in attack for Celtic since his summer arrival from Nordsjaelland, good with both feet and in the air while also possessing the ability to play in different positions.\n\nHowever, with Martin O'Neill once again rejuvenating Celtic, Nygren is probably playing in his preferred midfield position going into Sunday's meeting with Auchinleck Talbot at Kilmarnock's Rugby Park (17:30).\n\nPeter Leven's third spell as Aberdeen's interim manager has got off to a difficult start.\n\nSuccessive 2-0 defeats by Rangers away and at home have done little to lift the mood at Pittodrie following Scottish Cup-winning manager Jimmy Thelin's departure earlier this month.\n\nThe Dons are on a seven-match winless streak in all competitions, with only one draw picked up during that sequence.\n\nAberdeen start the defence of their Scottish Cup at home to Championship side Raith Rovers on Sunday (14:30).\n\nThe Kirkcaldy side enjoyed an immediate upturn in form after Dougie Imrie arrived from Greenock Morton as manager in November, albeit they have only won once in their latest five outings, and travel to Pittodrie without pressure in this tie.\n\nRovers won their latest knock-out meeting, 2-1 at home in the League Cup in August 2021, and won 1-0 at Pittodrie in their last Scottish Cup meeting in February 2010.\n\nA repeat would certainly make headlines, something Leven will know all too well.\n\nO'Neill calls for patience on Celtic transfers\n\nHearts 'underdogs by long shot' but still setting Premiership pace",

    "fullText": "Zoe Stratford took two weeks to bask in England's Women's Rugby World Cup glory.\n\nShortly after lifting the world title in front of nearly 82,000 people at Twickenham, the England captain and her club and country team-mate Natasha Hunt were picking up something else - the keys to a new business venture.\n\nWhile each of the Red Roses earned a World Cup-winning bonus of £20,000 and the most lucrative of their central contracts are worth just short of £50,000, all of England's squad have to make plans for life after rugby.\n\nWing Abby Dow, 28, retired after the tournament to pursue a career in mechanical engineering. Hooker May Campbell combines her rugby with working at a crypto payment company. Amy Cokayne is a police officer in the Royal Air Force.\n\nLock Stratford and scrum-half Hunt have chosen a different route, opening a coffee shop together.\n\nThe pair have premises close to Kingsholm, where they run out for PWR side Gloucester-Hartpury.\n\n\"It's been incredibly fun renovating it, putting our ideas into it,\" said Stratford.\n\n\"With rugby we had so much intensity coming into the World Cup. Afterwards we were a bit exhausted with it, so this gave us a new lease of life.\n\n\"We didn't just have rugby, we could put our energy into this coffee shop and making it ours.\"\n\nTheir shop is called 'MoZo' - an amalgamation of Stratford's first name and Hunt's nickname 'Mo'.\n\nStratford says that the venture has given her a valuable distraction from sport, allowing her to switch off when she is away from the pitch.\n\n\"It is super important to have these other interests,\" she added.\n\n\"I think the reason so many of the girls are successful is because they have interests besides rugby. The coffee shop give us that release.\"\n\nBoth Stratford and Hunt have been getting stuck in on the shop floor working shifts, including on the day of Gloucester men's match against Castres in early December.\n\n\"I am terrible at coffee art,\" Stratford said when asked about the skill of making patterns and pictures in the frothy top of drinks.\n\n\"I stick to the till. Mo is very good though. Sometimes I mess the stock up and she is pulling her hair out with me, but it is cool.\n\n\"It is something we have wanted to do and hopefully we will grow it.\"\n\nThree-time defending champions Gloucester-Hartpury have won all seven of their PWR games this season, while both Stratford and Hunt were named in a 47-strong England training camp this month.\n\nEngland begin the defence of their Women's Six Nations title against Ireland at Allianz Stadium in Twickenham on 11 April.",

    "description": "Era-defining rivalries continue and career Grand Slams could be unlocked as the Australian Open starts on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "After another off-season break deemed too short by some, the first Grand Slam of the year is about to begin.\n\nSo what are the main Australian Open storylines to be aware of before play gets under way on Sunday?\n\n'A chapter of life' ends - Alcaraz on Ferrero split\n\n5 Live Sport: All About... Australian Open\n\nThis is the question everyone has been asking.\n\nJannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are not just the best two players on the ATP Tour – they are operating in a class of their own.\n\nThe pair have claimed the past eight major titles between them, with Italy's Sinner targeting a third Melbourne title in a row.\n\nSinner's relentlessly metronomic baseline game marries perfectly with the medium-fast hard courts. The looser, more creative Alcaraz has not managed to master the Melbourne surface and has yet to go beyond the quarter-finals here.\n\nThat, however, is down to lack of rhythm at the start of the year, rather than a lack of adaptability.\n\nIf the 22-year-old Spaniard does hit the ground running – as he starts a new era without long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero – he will become the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam.\n\nAlcaraz said at the end of last season that in 2026 he would \"rather win my first Australian Open than retain my French Open and US Open titles\".\n\nAlcaraz is not the only player aiming to complete a clean sweep of Slam titles.\n\nLike Alcaraz, Poland's Iga Swiatek has six Grand Slam titles to her name, and the Australian Open is the missing piece of the jigsaw.\n\nThe 24-year-old has already cemented her place as a future great after a Wimbledon triumph last year which few predicted - including herself.\n\nHowever, defeats by Coco Gauff and Belinda Bencic at the curtain-raising United Cup showed Swiatek will need to quickly iron a few things out in Melbourne.\n\nSwiatek says she can \"hear\" the talk about the career Slam, but she is intent on shutting out any thoughts of achieving it.\n\n\"Obviously it would be a dream come true. This is not my clear goal that I wake up with. I'm thinking more about how I want to play, what I want to improve day by day,\" she said.\n\nGauff joins Swiatek as part of a triumvirate who has won nine of the past 12 majors, but it is the third member - two-time Melbourne champion Aryna Sabalenka - who is the pre-tournament favourite.\n\nWorld number one Sabalenka warmed up by winning the Brisbane title last week, although she believes that counts for little.\n\n\"It's tennis - that's why it's so beautiful because you cannot predict anything,\" said the 27-year-old Belarusian, who lost to Madison Keys in last year's Australian Open final.\n\n\"Every day you go out there and prove your level.\"\n\nThe problem with emerging as a teenage superstar is that expectations suddenly rocket and, in Emma Raducanu's case, become almost unmanageable.\n\nNow into the fifth season since her scarcely believable US Open triumph, there is no escaping that the 23-year-old needs to prove she belongs at the top of the WTA Tour.\n\nThe challenge for Raducanu this season is closing the gulf to the very best in terms of head-to-head results and ranking.\n\nThe signs last year were encouraging and regaining her place in the world's top 30 means she will be seeded at the Australian Open – but the prospect of Sabalenka in the third round looms large.\n\nRaducanu is one of seven British players in the men's and women's singles draws, and she is the highest-ranked following Jack Draper's withdrawal with injury.\n\nCameron Norrie, Jacob Fearnley, Francesca Jones, Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter all earned direct entry, while Arthur Fery came through qualifying.\n\nRaducanu beaten by world number 204 in Hobart\n\nAustralia has felt like a home away from home for Novak Djokovic for the majority of his career.\n\nThe Serb has won 10 of his 24 Grand Slam titles on Rod Laver Arena and the smart money goes on him winning again in Melbourne if he is to finally pull clear of Margaret Court with a standalone all-time record 25th.\n\nThere is no escaping that Father Time is catching up with the 38-year-old.\n\nIn the past two seasons he has struggled to match Alcaraz and Sinner physically over five sets, yet he remains the player most capable of beating them with his technical ability and single-mindedness.\n\nLast season Djokovic reached the semi-finals of all four majors - a remarkable feat of consistency at the highest level.\n\nPredicting what the world number four might achieve this year is difficult. It would also be foolish to write him off.\n\nLive radio commentaries across BBC Radio 5 Live Sport and BBC Sounds, plus live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website and app\n\nA few factors have helped the Australian Open market itself as the 'Happy Slam'.\n\nSun-soaked Melbourne summer days boost the dopamine levels, while the feelgood factor is helped by the party atmosphere around the grounds.\n\nSuperstar DJs, hot bands, hip restaurant link-ups and premium alcohol brands are available around the site, which is based in the heart of Melbourne's central district.\n\nTournament director Craig Tiley understands the importance of closing the gap on Wimbledon, the French Open and US Open in terms of status and commercial pull.\n\nPlayers talk glowingly about the event, with particular emphasis placed on the quality of facilities behind the scenes.\n\nHowever, a group of leading players are said to be \"disappointed\" the organisers still don't provide a greater share of the total revenue - even though a record prize pot of £55m is available this year.\n\nWider concerns remain over player welfare and, with the Australian Open having a history of issues with heat and late-night finishes, those issues could come to the fore again over the next fortnight.\n\nMaking progress or helpless?

    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah will return to Liverpool next week with boss Arne Slot saying he would be pleased to have the forward back even if he had \"15 attackers\".\n\nFor the past month Salah has been on international duty with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), but he will head back to Merseyside after Saturday's third-place play-off against Nigeria.\n\nThe 33-year-old gave an explosive interview shortly before departing for Afcon, in which he claimed \"someone doesn't want me in the club\" and that he no longer had any relationship with Slot.\n\nHe was subsequently left out of the Liverpool squad for their 1-0 win at Inter Milan but came off the bench to register an assist against Brighton four days later.\n\nSlot said before the Inter game he had \"no clue\" if Salah, who has scored 250 goals in 421 appearances for Liverpool, had played his last game for the club, but he is now ready to welcome him back.\n\n\"First of all, he needs to play another big game for Egypt on Saturday and then he comes back to us,\" said Slot.\n\n\"I am happy that he comes back. Mo has been so important for this club, for me, so I am happy that he is back.\n\n\"Even if I had 15 attackers I still would have been happy if he came back but that is not our current situation.\"\n\nLiverpool are unbeaten in six games since Salah left for Afcon, winning three, and face Burnley at Anfield on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\n\nBut with record signing Alexander Isak out for a number of months after undergoing surgery on a left leg fracture, Slot will be glad to have his attacking options boosted.\n\nThe Reds travel to Marseille for a Champions League game on Wednesday but no decision has been made over whether Salah will be available for that, or if he will be held back until Bournemouth away on 24 January.\n\n\"We are talking together about [the Marseille game] now,\" Slot said.\n\n\"We are in talks with him about what is expected of him over there, what is expected over here. But first of all he needs to have an important game on Saturday and next week he will be back.\"\n\nOn his talks with Salah following the very public fallout last month, the Dutchman added: \"What happens between Mo and me, on the phone or over here, stays between the two of us.\n\n\"And I don't think it is necessary for me to share all the private conversations I have.\"\n\nSlot also confirmed that Liverpool have no further injury worries outside of long-term absentees Isak, Conor Bradley and Giovanni Leoni.",

    "description": "For the first time in the 12-year history of the CFP, both starting QBs in the title game hail from Florida high schools. But it’s not just the quarterbacks.",
    "fullText": "For the first time in the 12-year history of the CFP, both starting QBs in the title game hail from Florida high schools. But it’s not just the quarterbacks. What’s even more intriguing is that 58 players in the National Championship were born in Florida, which is a blueprint that the new head coach, Jon Sumrall, cannot ignore.\n\n“Florida breeds football,” wrote Hard Rock Bet, Florida’s only legal sports book, sharing a collage of all Florida-born players on Thursday.\n\nBoth star performers, Fernando Mendoza and Carson Beck, hail from Florida but from different cities. This signals that coach Sumrall needs to focus on recruiting local talent to build a title-winning roster for the Gators. This past season, Florida endured a rough 4–8 campaign, prompting the hiring of Jon Sumrall to get the program back on track.\n\nPrograms dominating with homegrown talent justify the importance of retaining local players. In fact, Georgia, under Kirby Smart, did the same thing in 2024-25. They kept most of their roster from Georgia high schools, which paid off with back-to-back titles and a 2025 playoff run.\n\nWhile Jon Sumrall has already added proven talent. The Gators have secured commitments from Auburn WR Eric Singleton Jr., PSU OT Eagan Boyer, and OL T.J. Shanahan Jr., UCF LB TJ Bullard, Georgia Tech OL Harrison Moore and QB Aaron Philo, and more. Meanwhile, the program has also lost nearly 20 players to the transfer portal, including star QB DJ Lagway.\n\nFilling gaps is now essential. But Sumrall’s 2026 roster shows a chance to return the Gators to the glory days of 2008, when they defeated Oklahoma to win the BCS National Championship.\n\nThe 2026 roster features plenty of Florida-born talent, including Bryce Lovett, Dallas Wilson, Jamari Lyons, TJ Abrams, Cormani McClain, and more. While this year’s national championship clearly shows Florida players have football in their blood, the 2026 roster only needs Sumrall’s guidance to turn that talent into execution.\n\nNow, while Sumrall prioritizes retention and has proven his ability to develop talent at its best, something he already showed at Tulane, it’s time for the Gators to step into the spotlight under his leadership. The HC has already hit the ground running at Florida, making roster retention his top priority. That’s probably why key players, like running back Jadan Baugh, quickly re-signed after meeting with him.\n\n“Future Gators matter, sure, but current Gators matter more,” he said.\n\nWhile his mantra is simple: production over pedigree, at Troy and Tulane, he turned unranked and two-star recruits into NFL-ready talent. Now, Florida hopes he can work the same magic in Gainesville. While both teams boast Florida-born talent, which has the better chance to win? Oddsmakers favor Indiana to take the national championship, yet the Miami Nation hasn’t given up hope.\n\nThe Hurricanes are gearing up to face the Hoosiers for the National Championship on January 19, and the excitement is electric. Here, fans and alumni are buzzing, drawing comparisons to past glory days.\n\nRoderick Carter, a former LB and 1987 national champion, sees echoes of his team in this year’s squad.\n\n“It brings me back to the glory days. Brings me back to where we were competing at a high level,” said Carter.\n\nNow a behavior coach and case manager in Palm Beach County, Carter isn’t worried about the doubters.\n\n“I know there’s a lot of analysis and experts thinking Miami is going to come up short. I just think that we have what it takes, you know, to be victorious come Monday night,” he added.\n\nJust like that, the sentiment is clear: this team has talent and the hunger to win. But on the flip side, fans are riding the wave of momentum from the Fiesta Bowl, where Miami defeated Ole Miss in style.\n\n“I think our defense has been really great this year. Our defense and our offense—we have some really talented players; Malachi Toney has been killing it. Shout out to him. He’s amazing,” said Canes fan Daniela Battisti.\n\nWith the last national title in 2001, many current supporters weren’t even born then, but the spirit of the ‘U’ is alive and roaring.\n\nThe post 2026 National Championship Spotlight Offers a Lesson Jon Sumrall Can’t Afford to Ignore as Gators HC appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

That was not the mentality when I came in here.\n\n\"Now, we go into every game to win. That's the part that will get us where we want to be and that makes me really happy.\"\n\nHaving not played for 17 days - because of weather and FA Cup postponements - Fuchs has focused on togetherness within his team, a fundamental part of the recent upturn of performances.\n\nHe revealed the players had a \"nice spa retreat for team building and team bonding\".\n\nFuch's side face 16th-placed Gillingham at Priestfield with the Exiles knowing a result could lift them off the foot of the League Two table.\n\nThe hosts go into the game off the back of their own stuttering form, winless since 8 November.\n\nNewport have won five of their last six encounters against the Kent club, with their most recent victory coming in the first round of the FA Cup via penalties earlier this season.\n\nCounty supporters will be optimistic given the club's recent activity in the January transfer window.\n\nThe Exiles have secured the permanent signing of James Crole from Cymru Premier side Penybont and three loan signings with Tanatswa Nyakuhwa from Cardiff, Ryan Delaney from Swindon and Harrison Biggins from fellow strugglers Shrewsbury.\n\nThe signings mean for the first time this season Fuchs has genuine depth to choose from.\n\n\"I've got decisions to make, but they are good decisions. We have really good depth, quality players. You bring players in to raise the quality of the team, and they definitely do.\"\n\nFuchs might not be done adding to his squad, confirming the club is \"working on another signing\".",

    "fullText": "Patrick Mahomes makes feelings about Matt Nagy perfectly clear originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are in rare territory.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, the team did not make the playoffs. Star quarterback Patrick Mahomes also went down with a season-ending injury and the Chiefs ended up going 6-11.\n\nThat lack of success hasn't made teams any less interested in the team's assistants, though. Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy and defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo have both received head coach interest from teams in this cycle.\n\nNagy, in particular, appears likely to land a new gig. If the coach leaves, the Chiefs will have to find a new offensive coordinator for the first time since 2023.\n\nRecently, Mahomes was asked about Nagy and the quarterback gave a glowing review.\n\n\"I love Coach Nagy... He gave me a lot of ideas to be better as a person and as a quarterback... Wishing him the best throughout this head-coaching process,\" Mahomes said on Thursday.\n\nIf one of the best quarterbacks of all time likes you as a coach, you're probably doing something right. Mahomes played under Nagy in 2017 during the coach's first tenure in Kansas City, so there's plenty of familiarity between the two.\n\nIn 2023 and 2024 under Nagy, the Chiefs' offense was in the top half of the league in both points scored and total yards. The unit took a step back in 2025, finishing 20th in yards and 21st in points.\n\nHowever, the team as a whole regressed, and the offense dealt with some very bad quarterback play after Mahomes went down. Before the injury, Mahomes threw for 3,587 yards with 22 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.\n\nNagy is now looking for his second chance as a head coach. The first time around, Nagy coached the Chicago Bears from 2018-21 and compiled a 34-31 record. The longtime coach has been with the Chiefs since being fired by the Bears.\n\nSo far, Nagy has been reported to have interviewed with the Tennessee Titans, Baltimore Ravens, Las Vegas Raiders, and Arizona Cardinals for their head coaching vacancies. Notably, Nagy is familiar with Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi, as the two were together with the Chiefs.\n\nMike McDaniel could be headed to the AFC North\n\nRobert Griffin III roasts Browns after disastrous season\n\nDid the Dolphins fire McDaniel because of Harbaugh?\n\nFalcons listed as top landing spot for elite head coach\n\nAre the Cardinals the worst HC job in the NFL?\n\nPete Carroll could be replaced by elite college coach",

    "fullText": "Jacksonville University senior guard Priscilla Williams got off to a slow start vs. Central Arkansas on Jan. 15 at Swisher Gym.\n\nShe then turned in an electrifying second half and overtime on her way to the JU single-game scoring record as the Dolphins rallied from a 10-point deficit with 8:36 to play and a five-point deficit with less than 30 seconds left in regulation to beat the Sugar Bears 96-86.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Williams scored 44 points, 36 of them after halftime, breaking Edyn Battle’s record of 39 points against Bellarmine in the ASUN Tournament on March 7, 2025.\n\nIt's also the high individual game in the ASUN this season. JU (11-5, 3-2 in the ASUN) has scored 90 or more points in two of its last three conference games.\n\n“That was hard-fought, a great game,” Dolphins coach Special Jennings said. “Our team figured out a way to win. Great teams figure out how to get it done.”\n\nWilliams made 10 of 20 shots from the floor (four of seven from the 3-point arc) and did her real damage slashing to the basket, drawing foul after foul.\n\nShe made 20 of 22 shots from the foul line to break another pair of school records. Brandi Buie had the previous record in both categories when she made 16 of 19 on Jan. 23, 2017 vs. Lipscomb.\n\nAmazingly, Williams seemed on her way to a subpar night. She made only one of six field goals in the first half and missed her only two 3-point attempts, scoring eight points as the Dolphins trailed 40-36.\n\n“I was really kind of down in the first half, but my coaches calmed me down and told me to keep shooting,” she said. “I never even knew it was a record. My teammates gave me the ball. Shout out to them for letting me play my game.”\n\nJennings called Williams, who also had eight rebounds, three steals and three blocked shots “a unicorn.”\n\n“She knocks down shots, gets to the basket, makes free throws ... defensively she’s long,” Jennings said. “Really proud of that kid.”\n\nWilliams leads the Dolphins with 15.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game.\n\nWilliams scored 12 points in the third quarter, but the Dolphins trailed 61-57, then fell behind 67-57 when UCA’s Jenna Cooke (21 points), opened the fourth period with 3-point shots on back-to-back possessions.\n\nDespite Williams scoring 10 points over the next 4:06, the Sugar Bears’ Shae Littleford (20 points) helped keep UCA ahead. She made three or four foul shots at one point and the Bears led 77-72 with 31.9 seconds remaining.\n\nIt didn't last. Williams drew a foul and made two shots from the line with 18.3 seconds left and after UCA’s Cheyanne Kemp made one foul shot with 10 seconds left to give the Bears a 78-74 lead, Williams hit a 3-pointer to cut it to one.\n\nEmerie Bohanon was fouled intentionally and missed both free throws with five seconds left. After a timeout, the Dolphins rushed the ball up the court and freshman guard Tatum Brown drove the lane and was fouled with 0.07 left on the clock.\n\nBrown could have ended the game by making both free throws. She tied the game with the front end and missed the second.\n\nBut the Dolphins quickly took control in overtime. Junior guard Bailey Burns (12 points, six rebounds off the bench) scored 10 of her points in overtime, with three slicing layups in the first 1:41 of the extra period putting JU ahead for good. Williams got the school record with two foul shots with 1:05 left.\n\n“We needed this,” Williams said of the victory. “I’m really proud of our team.”\n\nBrown had 14 points and 11 rebounds and Makiya Miller added 12 points. The Dolphins overcame 27 turnovers (matching their season-high) and got out-rebounded 44-34.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Times-Union: Priscilla Williams scores a record 44 points to lead JU to overtime victory",

    "fullText": "Levi’s Stadium is used to roaring crowds and prime-time drama, but Brock Purdy’s most unforgettable moment this season didn’t come on a football field. It came at home, when the 49ers quarterback got the call that his wife Jenna was going into labor, and the team immediately told him to forget practice and be there for the birth of his daughter.\n\nPurdy and his wife Jenna quietly welcomed their first child in July, a daughter named Millie Joleen Purdy. The couple announced the news with a heartfelt joint Instagram post: “Millie Joleen Purdy Life just became a whole lot sweeter.” The arrival was a surprise, but the 49ers had no hesitation in allowing their franchise QB to step away from practice to be by his wife’s side.\n\n“Every single morning I’d wake up and go about my day like normal, just waiting for Jenna to send that text,” Purdy recalled during a press conference. “Then that morning she had her doula over and they said, ‘No, this baby’s coming today.’ I called Coach Shanahan and Lombardi and told them I couldn’t make it in. They were great — they said, ‘Enjoy it. Be there for her.’ And sure enough, our baby came that day.”\n\nPurdy and Jenna Brandt first met as students at Iowa State University and went public with their relationship in November 2022. Purdy proposed the following July in Saint Cloud, Florida, and the couple married on March 9, 2024, in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nJenna, born on Oct. 26, 1999, grew up in Sumner, Iowa, alongside her three siblings. A standout athlete herself, she played setter in high school volleyball before competing at Iowa State and later transferring to the University of Northern Iowa, where she finished her collegiate career in 2022 while studying kinesiology.\n\nNow the two are navigating life as young parents in the middle of an NFL season, something Purdy says has brought him even closer to his teammates.\n\n“So many of us are having kids at the same time,” he said with a smile. “Hopefully, we’ll be together for a while, and our kids can be out on the field pregame. Christian and I have talked about how cool it would be for them to remember us playing in the NFL.”\n\nPurdy is now back leading San Francisco through another postseason push. In a gritty 23–19 wild-card win over the Eagles, a game that saw the Niners lose George Kittle to an Achilles injury, Purdy threw for 262 yards and two touchdowns to help advance to the divisional round.\n\nWatching from the stands in Philadelphia were Jenna and baby Millie, turning the playoff trip into a family affair. Jenna later shared photos from the game on social media, writing, “Took the work trip to cheer on #13! Bang bang!”\n\nFans and fellow NFL wives flooded the comments with support. “Millie in Philly for the win,” one wrote, while Olivia Culpo chimed in with, “Team Millie!!!!!!” Kristin Juszczyk added, “The real star of the show is Millie girl!”\n\nUnder Kyle Shanahan, the 49ers have reached the NFC Championship every year they’ve made the playoffs, and Purdy hopes to keep that streak alive in Saturday’s rubber match with the Seahawks. No matter what happens on the field, the 2025 season has already given Purdy a victory bigger than football.\n\nThe post Brock Purdy’s Wife: When the 49ers Let Their QB Miss Practice for Jenna’s Delivery appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Rival 2025 Africa Cup of Nations final coaches in Rabat on Sunday, Walid Regragui of Morocco and Pape Thiaw of Senegal have both experienced the heartbreak of losing a title decider as players.\n\nStriker Thiaw was part of the Senegal squad that lost the 2002 AFCON final on penalties after a 0-0 draw with defending champions Cameroon.\n\nFull-back Regragui played in the following final, two years later, which Morocco lost 2-1 to hosts Tunisia.\n\nSenegal have played in two subsequent AFCON title deciders, losing to Algeria in 2019 and defeating Egypt on penalties three years later.\n\nBut before the 2025 AFCON, Morocco never progressed beyond the quarter-finals in eight attempts since finishing runners-up in Tunisia.\n\nRegragui created history in 2022 when he coached Morocco to the World Cup semi-finals, shocking Belgium, Spain and Portugal en route.\n\nIt was the first time an African or Arab nation had reached the last four in the quadrennial global showpiece.\n\nWhat made the achievement more remarkable was Regragui had taken charge of the Atlas Lions just three months before the World Cup kicked off after Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic was sacked.\n\nMorocco mocked form and tradition by topping a group including Croatia and Belgium, then eliminated Spain on penalties and Portugal before falling to France.\n\nBased on their performances in Qatar, Morocco were overwhelming favourites to win the 2024 AFCON in the Ivory Coast.\n\nBut after cruising to the round of 16, they came unstuck against South Africa. A brilliant Teboho Mokoena goal direct from a free-kick sealed a 2-0 victory for the underdogs.\n\nHaving qualified comfortably for the 2026 World Cup, Morocco are now one victory away from ending a 50-year wait for a second AFCON title after winning the 1976 tournament in Ethiopia.\n\n\"We are considered firm favourites to win this AFCON. I read that we will win the tournament comfortably. That if we do not win our campaign will be judged a failure,\" Regragui told reporters.\n\n\"My task, and the job of my staff and the senior players, is to keep our feet on the ground and remember why Morocco has not won the AFCON for 50 years.\n\n\"We have not won the AFCON because we lacked humility in many of the tournaments and we must not fall into that trap again.\n\n\"Morocco have progressed since that loss to South Africa. The squad has been rejuvenated. We have introduced young players while retaining the experienced core of the team.\n\n\"We came into this tournament with confidence, but nothing is guaranteed,\" said the 50-year-old born in a southern suburb of Paris.\n\nRegragui was capped 44 times by Morocco during a 14-year playing career, spent mainly in France. He had two seasons with Racing Santander in Spain and one with Moghreb Tetouan in Morocco.\n\nBefore taking charge of the Atlas Lions, his major coaching achievement was leading Wydad Casablanca to victory over Egyptian giants Al Ahly in the 2022 CAF Champions League final.\n\nAfter the disappointment of losing the 2002 AFCON final, Thiaw went to the World Cup in South Korea and Japan later that year.\n\nSenegal stunned defending champions France 1-0 in the opening match and exceeded expectations by reaching the quarter-finals, where they fell to Turkey.\n\nDakar-born Thiaw scored five goals in 16 national team appearances and played for clubs in France, Switzerland, Russia and Spain before retiring in 2009.\n\nAfter three seasons coaching Niarry Tally, a club bankrolled by a biscuit company, he was put in charge of the Senegal team preparing for the 2023 African Nations Championship (CHAN), a competition restricted to home-based footballers.\n\nThiaw unexpectedly led his country to glory, defeating hosts and favourites Algeria on penalties in the final after a goalless draw.\n\nNow 44, he succeeded Aliou Cisse as coach of the senior national team in December 2024 and has lost just once -- to Brazil in a London friendly match.",

Every starter recorded a bucket and they knocked down six of their first seven shots from behind the arc to open a quick double-digit advantage (15-5).\n\nShamet was the first man off the bench halfway through the first, and he immediately knocked down his first shot.\n\n- The Knicks pushed the lead out to as many as 17 points, but Karl-Anthony Towns was forced to the bench after picking up a pair of early fouls, and Golden State was able to flip the momentum. The home team used a 13-2 run to cut the deficit all the way back down to five at the end of the opening quarter (35-30).\n\n- Towns had five points and a game-high six rebounds in the first before being forced to the bench. The big man continued his domination into the second, picking up four more boards and a pair of putback buckets to help keep the slim lead midway through a back-and-forth middle quarter (46-44).\n\n- The Warriors took their first lead minutes later, and they were able to keep it at three heading into the break (62-59). Jimmy Butler led the way with 15 points on 7-of-10 shooting, KAT racked up a first-half double-double, and Mikal Bridges led the Knicks with 12 points.\n\n- Steph Curry didn't make a three during the first half (0-for-5), but it didn't take long for him to snap that skid in the third. The All-Star sharpshooter knocked down his first two coming out of the break as part of a Golden State 13-2 barrage, helping them quickly push the lead out to 11 points (78-67).\n\nMoses Moody added two more triples, giving him seven on the night and a season-high 21 points.\n\n- Each time it looked like the Knicks were ready to take back some of the momentum, the Warriors responded right back. New York simply could not get consecutive stops when they needed them the most, and they found themselves trailing by 12 points heading into the final frame.\n\n- Curry's big second half continued into the fourth, but the Knicks refused to go away, and they used a 10-2 run to get the deficit back down to nine points with just over four minutes remaining. Golden State's hot shooting couldn't be slowed down the stretch, though, and they held on for the victory.\n\nThe Warriors shot 54 percent from the field and 44 percent from behind the arc in the game.\n\n- McBride took advantage of the start with 25 points, Anunoby had 25 as well, Bridges had 21, and Towns had 17 and 20 boards. Shamet knocked down just two of his seven shots in his return and Jordan Clarkson chipped in 11 points, but the rest of the bench combined for just one point.\n\nButler led all scorers with 32 points, Curry had 27, Moody finished with 21 and Brandin Podziemski had 17 off the bench.\n\nCurry got hot after a slow start, making big shots to put this one away late.\n\nKAT 👌 pic.twitter.com/eQNzt8fXJE\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 16, 2026\n\nWelcome back Landry Shamet! pic.twitter.com/6e05v7nXIi\n\n— Knicks Videos (@sny_knicks) January 16, 2026\n\nThe Knicks return home to MSG to host the Phoenix Suns on Saturday at 7:30 p.m.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua has returned to the gym, continuing his recovery from a car crash in Nigeria that killed two of his close friends.\n\nThe former world heavyweight champion sustained injuries in the 29 December incident, which claimed the lives of Sina Ghami, his strength and conditioning coach, and Latif ‘Latz’ Ayodele, a trainer.\n\nThe friends had been travelling on a major road near Lagos when their vehicle stuck a stationary truck.\n\nJoshua sustained injuries, but was released from hospital two days later.\n\nIn a statement at the time, posted on X, Lagos state commissioner for information Gbenga Omotoso said that Joshua was “deemed clinical fit to recuperate from home”.\n\nThe boxer has now posted a Snapchat video showing him working out, hitting pads, and riding a stationary bike.\n\nOne clip was captioned \"mental strength therapy\".\n\nThe Watford-born boxer, of Nigerian descent, was on holiday in the country following his victory over Jake Paul in Miami just 10 days before the fatal collision.\n\nOn Wednesday, promoter Eddie Hearn said he believes Joshua will return to boxing when he has had time to heal.\n\nHe told Sky Sports: “He will need his time physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually before he makes a decision on his future. I do think he will want to return to boxing, but that will be his decision when the time is right.\n\n“It is certainly not a conversation I’ll be having with him any time soon. The only conversation is ‘are you OK?’ and sometimes we find people will give that facade of being OK, but what happened to him is not normal and heartbreaking for all involved.\n\n“When the time is right, I believe he will make his decision and you will hear it from him. That is the only voice you should listen to in that respect and we’ll give him his time to make that decision and heal.”",

    "title": "Here's how big the Dodgers' payroll is about to get after landing Kyle Tucker",
    "description": "When factoring in deferrals and luxury tax payments, the Dodgers are projected to pay nearly $120 million per year to put Kyle Tucker in right field.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers were the two-time defending World Series champions and the most expensive team in MLB history. And then they landed Kyle Tucker.\n\nMore specifically, they reportedly got the former Chicago Cubs star to agree to a four-year, $240 million contract, which is effectively the most expensive deal in MLB history on a per-year basis, when taking into account the deferrals in Shohei Ohtani's $70 million-per-year deal.\n\nIt is an outrageous development. The Dodgers needed outfield help, yes, but teams with a record payroll aren't supposed to go out and grab the most expensive guy on the market, on a deal even larger than expected. MLB has tried over the past several years to discourage its biggest spenders from making the game appear even more unfair, and the Dodgers are laughing at them through a megaphone purchased with Ohtani bucks.\n\nHow big does this make the Dodgers' payroll, which was the largest in MLB last season at $416.7 million per Spotrac? It's now reportedly down to approximately $413.5 million, according to Spotrac.\n\nThat might feel like counterintuitive because, y'know, $60 million-per-year outfielder. Here's why that's the case.\n\nThe Dodgers had an enormous payroll and just added another big contract, but they saw a considerable number of contracts move off the books after 2025. And none of those contracts were for their biggest stars.\n\nMichael Conforto ($17 million), Kirby Yates ($13 million), Chris Taylor ($13 million) Clayton Kershaw ($7.5 million), Kiké Hernández ($6.5 million), Michael Kopech ($5.2 million), Evan Phillips ($6.1 million), Tony Gonsolin ($5.4 million) and Austin Barnes ($3.5 million) made a combined $77.2 million and are now off the team via free agency, trades and non-tenders.\n\nHernández was the only one of those players who made a significant contribution to the Dodgers' World Series run. Using Baseball Reference's calculation of Wins Above Replacement, that nine-man group combined for 0.3 WAR in the regular season.\n\nThe Dodgers had also been spending modestly — by their standards — until the Tucker deal. Since the start of free agency, they had signed three players to major league contracts: closer Edwin Díaz (three years, $69 million), infielder/World Series hero Miguel Rojas (one year, $5.5 million) and infielder Andy Ibañez (one year, $1.2 million).\n\nLos Angeles was on track for a less expensive team until the Tucker deal. The team opted to go moderately more expensive in order to add Yahoo Sports' No. 1 MLB free agent.\n\nLet's just go ahead and list them real quick. Here is every Dodgers contract larger than $50 million total, without factoring in deferrals:\n\nShohei Ohtani: 10 years, $700 million\n\nMookie Betts: 12 years, $365 million\n\nYoshinobu Yamamoto: 12 years, $325 million\n\nKyle Tucker: four years, $240 million\n\nBlake Snell: five years, $182 million\n\nFreddie Freeman: six years, $162 million\n\nWill Smith: 10 years, $140 million\n\nTyler Glasnow: five years, $136.5 million\n\nTommy Edman: five years, $74 million\n\nTanner Scott: four years, $72 million\n\nEdwin Díaz: three years, $69 million\n\nTeoscar Hernández: thee years, $66 million\n\nEvery contract except for Betts and Freeman has been signed since the end of the 2023 season.\n\nAs for deferred money, let's get into that.\n\nHere is that same list, with the money the Dodgers will reportedly be paying for those contracts after they're over.\n\nTeoscar Hernández: $23.5 million\n\nThat adds up to $1.081 billion, and that's not even every Dodgers contract on the books. Obviously, Ohtani is doing most of the work there.\n\n[Get more Dodgers news: L.A. team feed]\n\nWe should also make a quick note about deferrals. The popular conception is that teams who sign players to contracts with deferred money are kicking the can down the line and will someday have to come up with an enormous amount of cash. We celebrate Bobby Bonilla Day for a reason.\n\nHowever, the reality is more complicated than that. Under collective bargaining agreement rules, teams still have to put up \"deferred money,\" but that cash goes to escrow accounts instead of the players. Once in those accounts, teams are under strict regulations over what they can do with it, but they are allowed to invest the cash in low-risk vehicles.\n\nSo that $680 million the Dodgers will owe Ohtani after 2033? They'll have already put that money up, while enjoying interest and modest returns. That's not nothing when the total sum of money working for you is more than $1 billion.\n\nRemember that $413 million mark above? It's not the best representation of what the 2026 roster, as currently constructed, will cost the Dodgers.\n\nLast year, the Dodgers' CBT number was $417 million. For that number, the Dodgers had to pay a $169 million luxury tax bill, which was larger than the 2025 payrolls of 12 MLB teams. In total, the Dodgers paid $586.7 million for their championship roster.\n\nFor 2026, Spotrac projects that tax bill number to go down to $161.9 million, making the total cost around $610 million.\n\nHowever, what's ridiculous is their tax bill would have been around $99.1 million without the Tucker deal, which is rated at $57.1 million per year in CBT calculations due to the deferred money. Because overages are taxed at 110% at the Dodgers' level, Tucker alone will make the Dodgers responsible for $62.8 million in tax money in 2026.\n\nSo the Dodgers are basically paying $119.9 million to put Tucker in right field. Which is larger than the current CBT payrolls of the Cleveland Guardians, Tampa Bay Rays and Miami Marlins.\n\nYou might be wondering, how did we get here? How is there a team making the George Steinbrenner Yankees look like a scrappy underdog?\n\nThe Dodgers have a lot going for them structurally. They are the dominant team in MLB's second-largest market. They have the largest stadium by capacity in MLB. They have the largest TV deal in the sport. They have a fan base with considerable spending power.\n\nThat's why the Dodgers were spending big and winning 100 games per season under their current ownership group. But this level of financial bombardment, which has now yielded back-to-back titles?\n\nIt is not hyperbole to say that Ohtani's contract is the biggest bargain in all of sports, especially when considering the deferrals. The Dodgers don't make much money from his jersey sales or the broadcast of their games in Japan (MLB divides both of those revenue streams among the 30 teams, so the Cincinnati Reds will make as much money from an Ohtani jersey as the Dodgers), but Ohtani has given them the one international star in baseball, combined with a premium brand and seemingly inevitable winning.\n\nIn the way some call Harvard a hedge fund with a university attached, the Dodgers are a Japanese advertising firm with a baseball team attached. The team has so much cultural cachet in Japan it can name its price for on-field advertisements, and will be enjoying popularity in the world's third-richest country for generations.\n\nCombine that with the usual outlay of winning a World Series, which the Dodgers have accomplished twice in as many seasons with Ohtani, and there's nothing comparable on the landscape of MLB.\n\nThe Tucker contract is going to make a lot of fans angry. It's going to make some team owners angry. And so we come to the salary cap question.\n\nWith MLB's CBA up after 2026, many observers feel a labor stoppage is inevitable. MLB has already made it clear it wants a salary cap, which has been a non-starter with the MLB Players Association for decades.\n\nThe Dodgers' dominance has been treated as an endorsement for the salary cap, to level the playing field of an unfair game. The thing is, however, MLB quite likes when the Dodgers are good. And the Yankees. And all of its biggest teams. The league has seen great ratings over the past two years and the Dodgers are a major reason why.\n\nIt's fun for some to imagine the Dodgers being forced to sell their team off if MLB gets its way with a salary cap. However, the reality will probably be less than satisfying for the biggest Dodger haters, at least in the short term. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred wants to keep labor costs down, but he's also going to want the Dodgers to keep winning, to a reasonable degree.\n\nSo what does the Tucker deal mean for the bigger picture? Maybe not much, especially when the Dodgers bringing him in only brought their payroll up to 2025 levels. And it's hard to imagine the Dodgers haven't already thought up some plans depending on how the CBA negotiations go.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIf it were up to college football podcaster and analyst Josh Pate, the Big Ten-SEC debate as to which conference holds the cards isn't even close.\n\nPate said on a recent edition of \"Josh Pate's College Football Show\" that the Big Ten deserves the same respect, if not more, than the SEC in this current era of college football.\n\n“The SEC is lagging behind the Big Ten, at the top,\" Pate said. \"I would even venture to suggest the middle-tier now is at least comparable if not slightly lagging behind. That’s probably where my perception has changed of late, moreso than at the top. So I’m not beating that drum.”\n\nPate made an interesting follow-up point: it doesn't even matter that the Indiana Hoosiers are currently the class of the league. It's the psychological framework about what makes those players more polished than those from the SEC. And it's greater than just mental and physical toughness, Pate said.\n\nMore: Todd McShay passionately defends Dante Moore's decision to return to Oregon Ducks\n\n“Maybe the average Big Ten player is wired a little bit differently, maybe they focus a little more on the football aspect, the mean-and-potatoes aspect of football, instead of the more highlight-ish, branding aspect of football,” Pate said.\n\nThat \"wired\" approach is the most unique part. It can't be taught. It can't be studied.\n\n“If you think that’s ridiculous, it’s because it is,” Pate said. “But that’s been standard practice in the SEC for awhile.

    "description": "The Mets swung for Kyle Tucker, but the outfielder ultimately took the Dodgers' $240 million offer, and New York is now trying to figure out how to salvage their offseason.",
    "fullText": "Only a couple of hours after Steve Cohen tweeted that he was looking for signs of smoke, a Vatican-style reference to the Mets waiting for an answer from Kyle Tucker, the Los Angeles Dodgers stunned him and the entire baseball world by signing the slugger to a deal worth $60 million a year on Thursday night.\n\nSo it’s almost too easy yet…the question begs to be asked: does Cohen want this smoke?\n\nOr will he, like most other MLB teams now, hold his cards close to the vest and wait for the inevitable lockout and war over a salary cap that is coming after the 2026 season?\n\nIn short, the Mets probably thought they were raising the bar into rarefied air by offering Tucker, a very good hitter but hardly a superstar, $220 million over four years. And in some ways, they were. Only for the Dodgers to swat them aside almost dismissively.\n\nSuffice to say, Cohen did no further tweeting on Thursday night.\n\nAnd I’m not blaming him or the Mets for drawing a line at $55 million a year (their final offer) for Tucker, as absurd as that sounds.\n\nYet, getting outbid must still be embarrassing in a way to Cohen. He’s a man who’s accustomed to getting what he wants, after all, even if it means spending obscene amounts of money for art pieces to add to his renowned collection.\n\nAs the richest billionaire owner in baseball, Cohen was supposed to be the death of baseball, remember?\n\nYes, the irony here is that this is what most other owners in the sport feared when Cohen said at his very first press conference as owner of the Mets that he wanted to model his organization after the Dodgers, that he might use his billions to create a new Evil Empire in Queens.\n\nRemember, at the time, the Dodgers were indeed a model organization that consistently drafted and developed home-grown talent in a way that allowed them to challenge for a championship every year without blowing the roof off the payroll.\n\nNow it’s different, of course. Helped in large part by the Shohei Ohtani connection that has attracted other Japanese stars and his willingness to defer hundreds of millions of dollars on his $700-million contract, the Dodgers are now outspending the rest of baseball in a manner that may have made even the famously impulsive George Steinbrenner look like a piker were he still alive today.\n\nEvil Empire? More like King Kong at this point.\n\nStill, Cohen has the money if he wants to compete with the big, bad Dodgers. And none of this is to excuse the Mets for what has been an underwhelming offseason.\n\nAs it is, it’s hard to tell if their sudden all-out pursuit of Tucker was part of their plan all along or more of a realization they desperately needed a big-splash move as Mets fans showed their displeasure with their wallets.\n\nDid they suddenly decide they better find someone to hit behind Juan Soto so he wouldn’t walk 150 times next season?\n\nWouldn’t it just have been easier to give Pete Alonso the $150 million over five years? He had made it clear he was willing to ease into the DH role, so I’ll never understand why the Mets drew such a hard line there.\n\nThey were willing to go three years but not five? It just never made sense, considering their need for a right-handed power hitter. And whatever their intentions at that time were regarding Tucker, they left themselves vulnerable one way or another.\n\nAnd now, even if they change course and throw crazy money at Cody Bellinger, well, sure, he’d make them better in a lot of ways, but he wouldn’t fill the huge hole in the lineup behind Soto.\n\nSo it’s hard to see how they’re going to have anything resembling a championship-caliber offense, whether they go after Bellinger or not.\n\nAnd if they were truly going all-in on run prevention, the David Stearns buzzword from the moment the 2025 season ended, why haven’t they made the expected moves to upgrade their pitching?\n\nDominant starting pitching and a lockdown bullpen would always offer hope of beating anyone, even the Dodgers, in a short series in October, yet the Mets haven’t gone that route either.\n\nAll along, I’ve said it wasn’t fair to judge Stearns until the offseason was over. And who knows, maybe now he’ll go out and trade for Freddy Peralta and sign Framber Valdez, and suddenly the Mets will have a starting rotation that can indeed beat anybody, especially if Nolan McLean blossoms into the ace everyone is now expecting.\n\nBut lest we forget, Edwin Diaz is now a Dodger, too. And while I’m laying some of that on Diaz for seemingly wanting to take the easy route to winning a championship ring, the Mets put themselves in a position to let it happen by not locking up their closer before LA ever got involved.\n\nIn truth, the most logical move at this point for Cohen might just be to hold onto his chips, save his money for Tarik Skubal next winter, or whenever the sport is open for business again, while seeing what McLean, Jonah Tong, Brandon Sproat, Carson Benge, Jett Williams and other top prospects look like by mid-summer as the trading deadline approaches.\n\nI’m not saying the Dodgers are unbeatable. The Blue Jays were one hanging slider away from beating them in the World Series.\n\nBut it’s hard to see how the Mets, without dramatic pitching upgrades at the very minimum, can realistically compete with LA for a championship in 2026.\n\nAnd right now that’s on Stearns. You can blame the Dodgers all you want for blowing up the sport and setting up a salary cap fight not only between owners and players, but owners and owners as well.\n\nYet the Mets shouldn’t be sitting here in mid-January trying to figure out how to save their offseason. If Stearns’ plan was to let the market come to him in search of the best value, which seems to be his M.O., well, it sure looks to be backfiring to the point where desperation is now part of the equation.\n\nDesperation and the LA Dodgers, that is.",

What does the league have for an encore?\n\nEvery team still in the hunt for the Lombardi Trophy plays in the divisional round, with the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks joining the fray after opening the playoffs with a bye. The Broncos will face a steep challenge as they host Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills, while the Seahawks will see the division-rival San Francisco 49ers for the second consecutive week.\n\nOn Sunday, the Houston Texans and their stellar defense will try to end the New England Patriots' dream season, while the Chicago Bears are hoping a massive comeback isn't necessary to survive the Los Angeles Rams at Soldier Field.\n\nFour networks will broadcast the action on divisional weekend, setting the stage for the AFC and NFC championship games.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the NFL's divisional round announcers as the road to Super Bowl 60 continues.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nJim Nantz and Tony Romo will call their second consecutive Bills game, with Allen and Buffalo heading on the road to Denver to face the top-seeded Broncos.\n\nNantz has long been the voice of the NFL on CBS, as he is wrapping up his 22nd season as the network's top play-by-play broadcaster for the league. Nantz also serves as the voice of the Masters on CBS each April and was the voice of college basketball's Final Four before retiring in 2023. Romo is in his ninth season as CBS' lead NFL color analyst alongside Nantz.\n\nKevin Burkhardt and Tom Brady will return for another 49ers broadcast on Saturday, after calling their win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round. This time, San Francisco is looking to knock off its NFC West-rival Seahawks.\n\nBurkhardt has headed Fox's lead NFL broadcasting crew since Joe Buck's departure for ESPN in 2022. Now in his fourth season in the top slot, Burkhardt called has already called two Super Bowls and is no stranger to big games. He will be joined by legendary quarterback Tom Brady, who has settled into his role as a color analyst nicely in his second season.\n\nAfter calling the Texans' wild-card win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Joe Buck and Troy Aikman will see Houston's vaunted defense try to knock Drake Maye and the Patriots out of the playoffs.\n\nBuck and Aikman have been paired together since 2022, but they left Fox for ESPN in 2022 and are in their fourth season as the voices of \"Monday Night Football.\" Buck was formerly the voice of the World Series at Fox, but he has focused on football since jumping to ESPN.\n\nESPN and ABC will air a divisional round game for the third consecutive season as Buck and Aikman look forward to their first Super Bowl broadcast since the move from Fox next season.\n\nMike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth called a bit of a quiet game in the wild-card round as the Patriots held the Los Angeles Chargers to three points, but there could be fireworks as the Bears host the Rams. Chicago is the king of the comeback this season, but L.A. is favored on the road.\n\nTirico has been the voice of \"Sunday Night Football\" on NBC since 2022, when he replaced Al Michaels on a full-time basis, while Collinsworth has been the network's lead color analyst since 2009. This will be the final game for the two until Super Bowl 60 in three weeks, as only CBS and Fox will broadcast the conference championship games.\n\nMORE:Updated 2026 NFL mock draft\n\nAnnouncers (Play-by-Play, Analyst)\n\nLos Angeles Rams @ Carolina Panthers\n\nGreen Bay Packers @ Chicago Bears\n\nBuffalo Bills @ Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nSan Francisco 49ers @ Philadelphia Eagles\n\nLos Angeles Chargers @ New England Patriots\n\nHouston Texans @ Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nAnnouncers (Lead Crew Assignment)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers @ Seattle Seahawks\n\nHouston Texans @ New England Patriots\n\nLos Angeles Rams @ Chicago Bears\n\nAnnouncers (Play-by-Play, Analyst)\n\nAnnouncers (Play-by-Play, Analyst)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNFL referees have been under fire throughout the 2025–26 season. It has often felt as though officials were deciding games, leaving fans around the league calling for reform this offseason.\n\nWhile a controversial call in the regular season can go viral, a missed or questionable call in the playoffs can result in a team being eliminated from contention. The importance of accuracy grows with each round, and the NFL strives to assign its best officiating crews to the biggest matchups.\n\nWith four games on the Divisional Round schedule, four different officiating crews have been assigned. None of those crews worked a game during the Wild Card round last weekend.\n\nHere is more on the referees for the 2026 NFL Divisional Round games.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\n10-12 yards deep in the offensive backfield.

The Umpire is focused on the interior linemen, watching for offensive holding and illegal blocks at the line of scrimmage, in addition to checking player equipment and counting offensive players.\n\nThe Sideline & Clock Monitors: The Down Judge and Line Judge patrol opposite sidelines, ensuring players are not offsides or encroaching and ruling on forward progress. The Down Judge also directs the chain crew. Deeper in the secondary, the Field Judge and Side Judge are positioned 20 yards off the line. They mirror each other, watching the widest receivers for pass interference and illegal contact, and marking plays that go out of bounds. The Field Judge is responsible for the 25-second play clock, while the Side Judge serves as the backup game clock operator.\n\nThe Deep Central Monitor: The Back Judge stands the deepest, typically focusing on the area between the safeties. Their central responsibilities include tracking the 40/25-second play clock, ruling on the validity of catches in the deep middle, and watching for action around the end zone and goalposts.",

    "description": "The OFC Professional League kicks off this week and a Baltic League has been proposed, so is there a future for cross-border football competitions?",
    "fullText": "Eight clubs, seven countries and an opportunity to face the world's best for the winner.\n\nA trailblazing new competition kicks off in Oceania this weekend - but could a similar cross-border league follow in Europe?\n\nThe OFC Professional League contains two clubs from New Zealand and one each from Australia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Tahiti and Vanuatu.\n\nIt will be the first professional league in Oceania since Australia switched to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006, meaning the winners will qualify for Fifa's annual Intercontinental Cup - pitting the champions of each confederation together - and the expanded Club World Cup.\n\nThe first round of fixtures begin at Auckland's 50,000-seater Eden Park from 17 January, with four more venues hosting stages before a play-off in May.\n\nOFC Professional League head Stuart Larman says there is huge support for football across the region and expects to see crowds of more than 10,000 in Fiji and the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe confederation is paying for flights, accommodation and transportation to help sides focus on developing their squads, brand and role in the community.\n\nThe hope, of course, is that the competition flourishes.\n\n\"A lot of things have to fall in place before I think we're ready to expand,\" says Larman. \"But certainly the dream is to get to a larger number of clubs.\n\n\"The success of the league will depend on strength of the clubs - so all have strong community links or ingrained community involvement.\n\n\"That's going to be key for them to have financial success, with big portfolios of commercial partners and a strong team off the pitch which is then generating a lot of money to invest in the first team and youth programmes.\"\n\nIt could also prove a scouting haven - a previously untapped pool of players who now have pathways into the professional game and a competitive environment in which to develop.\n\n\"People will be surprised at the quality,\" adds Larman.\n\n\"The best players in each country are going to get 17 highly competitive matches guaranteed - that is going to be an enormous jump, because more regular, highly competitive football always improves the quality of a player.\"\n\nMaksims Krivunecs starts with a disclaimer - he is not the biggest fan of cross-border leagues, although he is the man trying to pioneer one.\n\n\"I feel it is a necessity,\" says Krivunecs, president of Latvia's top-flight Virsliga, who is proposing a 'Baltic League' he hopes would also include Estonia and Lithuania.\n\nIndependent analysis has backed up Krivunecs' \"quite worrying\" evaluation that the Virsliga is struggling to keep pace with Europe's top 30 leagues.\n\n\"The domestic broadcasting deal is the main fuel for any league in the world to develop clubs, the league and the interest for the competition and unfortunately we have zero broadcasting deal,\" he says.\n\n\"We're very limited with resources. We don't have a big sponsorship market.\"\n\nWith Latvian football also competing with ice hockey and basketball for fans' attention, clubs largely rely on savvy transfers and passionate investors - which is why many have only been formed or reformed in the past 10 to 15 years.\n\n\"In this kind of environment you cannot even plan ahead for multiple years,\" says Krivunecs. \"Because if something happens with the investors' main business, the first thing to disappear is support to the clubs.\n\n\"We all want to build clubs with communities, that have a heritage, history, because that's how you make the product.\"\n\nKrivunecs has had to be innovative in trying to develop that \"product\" and generate interest - fantasy football, statistics, quizzes, predictions, full licensing on Football Manager. He has looked into streaming games on YouTube and collaborating with influencers on Twitch and TikTok.\n\nBut his biggest play is the cross-border Baltic League - one he believes would generate revenue, develop players and help clubs grow on the European circuit.\n\nIt is not a completely original prospect, there have been iterations before including between 2007 and 2011, but not in this format.\n\n\"The cross-border would allow us to create more competitive games,\" says Krivunecs, highlighting the difference in strength between the top and bottom Virsliga clubs. Indeed, RFS beat Ajax in the Europa League last year.\n\n\"We created the roadmap - a common structure, common product, common distribution and marketing.\"\n\nClubs in Latvia's 10-team top flight currently play each other four times. A Baltic League would see that reduced to single home and away fixtures before the top four split to face the corresponding finishers from Lithuania and Estonia.\n\nCarrying over points earned against the other three clubs from their country in the first half of the season, Latvia's four would then face those from Lithuania and Estonia home and away to establish each country's champion, runner-up and so on.\n\nSuch a format is important for each nation to keep their current Uefa competitions places - if the leagues were to merge completely, those would be reduced.\n\nAn overall Baltic League winner would be crowned, however, earning additional prize money.\n\nThe bottom six in each country, meanwhile, would compete to decide who is relegated and who goes into a play-off for a European spot against the fourth-best team - effectively guaranteeing each club has something to play for until the end.\n\n\"All these games are super important,\" says Krivunecs. \"Only two spots are neutral. And most important is that all games are more or less against a similar [level] opponent.\"\n\nKrivunecs believes Uefa would consider the feasibility of a cross-border league if the nations involved request it.\n\nHe says the project has full support from Latvian clubs and authorities, but is yet to fully convince those in Estonia and Lithuania.\n\n\"The more we talk, the more we explain, the more information we bring to their clubs, the situation is changing,\" he adds.\n\n\"What I believe is possible is in the next three years to go with the Lithuanian clubs together to show how it could work. And then Estonia could join.\n\n\"And with a perfect situation, if we want to maximise the market, maybe in future Finland could join because the level of the football is quite similar there.\"\n\nA handful of Welsh teams have long featured in the English leagues but other nations have looked into more defined structures in the past decade.\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands commissioned a feasibility study for a proposed 'BeNeLiga' in 2019 - suggesting it could help close the gap on Europe's top five leagues amid fears the Eredivisie and Belgian Pro League were fading.\n\nProposals for a split-season model were mooted, but in 2022 it was decided there was insufficient Dutch support for the project.\n\nVarious proposals for an 'Atlantic League' have also rumbled in the background since the turn of the century, initially including teams from the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Scandinavia and Scotland.\n\n\"I have spoken with Ajax, Feyenoord, Porto, Rangers and Celtic. They are interested,\" former PSV chairman Harry van Raaij told BBC Radio 5 Live in 2000.\n\nEuropean football's governing body responded by revamping the Uefa Cup with a group stage, but proposals - this time including the Republic of Ireland - re-emerged in 2016 as an alternative to the Champions League.\n\nThose plans, however, have gone cold since Celtic said in 2020 they were no longer interested. One figure involved in those talks believes it is unlikely they will be revived, but suggests there could be a future at youth level.\n\nEnglishman Larman, now based in Auckland but who previously lived in Japan and has worked on projects in more than 100 countries, says cross-border competition is something he has regularly discussed with colleagues, especially in Asia.\n\n\"It made more sense because those countries could not sustain a professional league with a large enough number of teams,\" he says.\n\n\"I always felt that Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would make sense - they would play their regular season and then the best teams play a final stage.\n\n\"They would be much more competitive over time and you get better crowds, it builds the clubs and makes clubs more professional.\"\n\nKrivunecs adds: \"I believe currently the Baltics is the best place for the pilot project. If we show the success of this competition, it might trigger different discussions.\"\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "Wayne Rooney says caretaker head coach Michael Carrick is the \"right choice at this moment in time\" to \"steady the ship\" at Manchester United.\n\nUnited confirmed that Carrick would take charge until the end of the season - succeeding Ruben Amorim - on Tuesday.\n\nRooney and Carrick were team-mates at Old Trafford, playing together on 366 occasions and winning five Premier League titles.\n\n\"It is probably the obvious choice really because I don't think there are any top, top managers available at the minute,\" he said on the latest edition of BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"I think it is the right choice at this moment in time.\n\n\"It is a difficult task of course. Where Manchester United are at the minute is not a good place and Michael has to go in and steady the ship.\"\n\nCarrick's short-term appointment still leaves questions around who the board will turn to in the summer.\n\nXabi Alonso, who left Real Madrid on Monday, and England manager Thomas Tuchel are among the names to have already been suggested.\n\n\"Alonso did incredible at Leverkusen and I think you have more chance of him sitting and waiting and hoping with [Liverpool manager Arne] Slot,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"Tuchel is the one for me. He knows the Premier League, has won trophies. He is doing well at England. Time will tell.\"\n\nWhat is it like to be a caretaker manager?\n\nIs Carrick the right man for Man Utd?\n\nCarrick made 464 appearances for United across a 12-year spell and had a three-game stint as caretaker manager at the club in 2021, winning two games and drawing one.\n\nThe 44-year-old managed Middlesbrough between 2002 and 2005.\n\n\"Michael's great fun. He is a great character, but don't be fooled by how calm he looks,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"He can have fun as well, but make no mistake, he'd be going in there now with full focus.\"\n\nManchester United sit seventh in the Premier League after winning just one of their past six games.\n\nCarrick's first assignment comes on Saturday (12:30 GMT) when Manchester City make the short trip to Old Trafford.\n\n\"It is a massive game for the club, for Michael,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"I think what he will do is bring a bit of calmness, a bit of grit to the game, which I think is needed. It is going to be very difficult, Manchester City are obviously a top team and it will be difficult to get anything out of it even at Old Trafford.\n\n\"But as we've seen over the years, Manchester United if they do turn up can win the game and hopefully that happens on Saturday.\"\n\nCarrick has brought former England assistant Steve Holland in as his number two, with Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion also part of his staff.\n\nHolland worked under Gareth Southgate when England finished fourth at the 2018 World Cup and were runners-up at Euro 2020 and 2024.\n\n\"I was really impressed him tactically at England, how he worked and his organisation,\" Rooney said.\n\n\"Steve Holland did all the training, Gareth Southgate didn't really, he'd be more the manager and Steve took all the sessions.\n\n\"I think what they will bring, Michael and Steve, is an organisation to Manchester United and I'm sure we'll see on Saturday, they'll be harder to beat.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

They also might need to identify a new quarterback, as it seems like Tua Tagovailoa’s days in Miami might be numbered, and the San Francisco 49ers might be willing to part with one of theirs, for the right price.\n\nMac Jones, who made the Pro Bowl in 2021 as a member of the New England Patriots, signed a two-year deal with San Francisco in March of 2025, but he’s resigned to a reserve role behind Brock Purdy, so perhaps the Niners would move him if the Dolphins came calling.\n\nMatt Johnson of Sportsnaut predicts that the Dolphins will trade for Jones over the offseason given his experience and reasonable price tag.\n\n“Moving on from Tua Tagovailoa will be expensive, creating a salary-cap situation that greatly limits whom the Miami Dolphins can pursue as their starting quarterback in 2026. That is why a Mac Jones trade makes the most sense,” Johnson wrote.\n\n“It would be a return home for the Florida native, with the hope that this stint yields better results than his time with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

It is a sufficient supporting cast that, with the right offensive play-caller, could allow him to perform well in a contract year.”\n\nBefore the Dolphins make a decision regarding their quarterback for next season, and potentially beyond, they’ll probably want to get a head coach in place, as that coach could well want a say in the QB selection process.\n\nBut, trading for Jones could be a low-risk, relatively high-reward move for Miami. Jones only has one year remaining on his deal, so acquiring him wouldn’t require a long-term commitment, and he should be highly motivated to perform in a contract year.\n\nIf things work well, the Dolphins could bring him back, as he is still just 27 years old. If not, they could cut bait and move on, no big deal.\n\nOf course, this is all hypothetical right now, but the Dolphins will have to do something at quarterback. Perhaps Jones could be an option.\n\nSteelers predicted to trade for Aaron Rodgers replacement over offseason\n\nRavens owner doesn't rule out Mike Tomlin as a coaching candidate in Baltimore\n\nJalen Hurts aims to end Eagles postseason inconsistencies",

While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning latent actions world models on in-the-wild videos, expanding the scope of existing works that focus on simple robotics simulations, video games, or manipulation data. While this allows us to capture richer actions, it also introduces challenges stemming from the video diversity, such as environmental noise, or the lack of a common embodiment across videos.",

    "fullText": "India’s competition watchdog has issued a final warning to Apple in a long-running antitrust case. After more than a year of back-and-forth, the regulator says Apple’s repeated requests for more time are blocking the process.\n\nThe investigation began after a 2022 complaint from Match, the owner of Tinder, and several Indian startups. Regulators later concluded that Apple abused its position in the iOS app market. They then asked Apple to submit objections and share financial data needed to assess penalties.\n\nSince then, the case has stalled. Apple has sought multiple extensions and challenged how any fine would be calculated. As a result, the dispute has remained stuck in legal review.\n\nThe commission noted that it asked Apple in October 2024 to respond to the findings and provide key financial details. However, Apple kept asking for more time. The order states that this cannot continue and warns that the case will move forward even without Apple’s reply.\n\nApple says it could face a fine of up to $38 billion if regulators base penalties on its global revenue. Because of this, the company has challenged the penalty rules in court and asked to pause the antitrust case until judges rule on that issue.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Apple plans to wait for the next court hearing on January 27 before responding. A source familiar with the matter said Apple views the regulator’s move as an attempt to preempt the court process.\n\nIf Apple does not submit its response by the deadline set by the commission, the regulator says it will proceed on its own. That would bring the long-running dispute closer to a decision, even as Apple continues its legal challenge in court.",

    "title": "The Mind as a City: A Systems View of Consciousness, by Ian Reppel",
    "description": "Ideas for a Changing World.",
    "fullText": "Ian Reppel is an Argentina-based independent researcher and audio engineer with a PhD in theoretical physics and has spent nearly fifteen years working in technology across Europe and Latin America. He writes at ianreppel.org on quantum computing, machine learning, leadership, and psychology, with a particular interest in how technology, incentives, and leadership shape human agency. He is currently writing a book on ethical product psychology, examining how psychology can be used to help people flourish without defaulting to manipulation while still supporting profitable products that make a positive difference. He also runs his own music studio, Crow Oak.\n\nThe following essay by Ian was an honorable mention in the 2025 Berggruen Prize Essay Competition.\n\nConsciousness is best understood as a system, not a single entity. Rather\nthan a single switch, it is an entire control panel with many switches and dials that can selectively disable or boost individual components or connections yielding different experiences we can probe in the lab. The systems view provides a cross-species perspective on consciousness, backed by philosophical traditions from across the globe, that also extends to artificial intelligence.\n\nConsciousness reveals itself at the very edges: when we lose it, when we enter an altered state through meditation or drugs, or when we observe its behavioural effects in other species. If consciousness were a single switch, anæsthesia would turn it off and on again cleanly, and every species would have the same neural wiring. Neither is true. Human anæsthetics alter wakefulness, the contents of experience, self-monitoring, or the ability to report to various degrees depending on the drug, its dose, or the patient’s cortical state. That suggests a composite mechanism: a system of interacting subsystems with failure modes that can be induced selectively. Such a systems view is agnostic of the underlying neural architecture or layout, so it maps well to non-human brains, too. All that matters in the systems view are the functions that make experience at all possible.\n\nWhile there is not a clear definition of consciousness that both scientists and philosophers can agree upon, one area where most can agree on a clear before and after, that is of consciousness and subsequent unconsciousness, even across species, is caused by sedation. Anæsthesia and similar instances where people and animals lose consciousness in a controlled environment are ideal to study the nature of consciousness.\n\nClinical neurology defines levels of arousal and access to contents in terms of measurable dynamics and brain networks. While some decry levels as a poor metaphor for consciousness that overlooks its multi-dimensional aspects, others contest that view. Irrespective of each point of view, these concepts do indeed serve a clear clinical purpose. The systems view of consciousness offers mechanisms and a multi-dimensional view with levels and access that is also based on neural correlates of consciousness, yet entirely free from any theory of mind.\n\nAnæsthesia: now you see it, now you don’t\n\nIn the operating theatre, the anæsthesiologist is a magician. While the patient focuses on counting backwards from ten, they apply a few drops of a clear liquid, and, voilà, the patient’s consciousness disappears entirely, only to reappear after the main performance, the surgery, is done.\n\nThe magic trick looks identical in every act, yet that is the real illusion. Different anæsthetics dissociate level and access with different reproducible neural signatures. Propofol produces frontal alpha rhythms that silence long-range frontoparietal communication. Ketamine preserves arousal while fracturing content and inhibiting the sense of self. Dexmedetomidine yields a sleep-like quiescence from which the patient can easily be aroused, often with dream-like reports upon prompting. There is therefore no single consciousness switch.\n\nClinical metrics such as the perturbational complexity index (PCI) distinguish wakefulness from deep anæsthesia and dreamless sleep. PCI measures the brain’s capacity to coordinate across regions. It can even signal hidden capacity in some non-responsive patients. Anæsthetics such as propofol decrease the PCI, whereas ketamine keeps it steady or increases it. Psychedelics also boost the PCI.\n\nDream research shows that the back of the brain can build vivid scenes even when the frontal regions are not engaged. With a pulse, the thalamus can temporarily restore intentional behaviour from deep anæsthesia in primates. Phrased differently, the brain can generate scenes without arousal, while arousal does not depend on any scene at all. Scene construction and arousal are separable parts of the same system.\n\nAltered states of consciousness\n\nWe do not have to enter the hospital to lose consciousness: we do it every night when we fall asleep. During the non-REM stages, arousal and connectivity are lowered, whereas we have vivid dreams in REM sleep. Content generation is therefore decoupled from behavioural output or sensory input.\n\nTraumatic brain injuries such as a concussion lead to a transient disconnection that impairs arousal, routing, or coordination, depending on the locus and severity. A short loss of consciousness often leads to the disruption of arousal pathways. Longer sequelæ cause network-level dysconnectivity. More severe disorders of consciousness (e.g. coma) can be evaluated with complexity measures, such as PCI. Interestingly, the EEGs of comatose patients often resemble those of people under general anæsthesia.\n\nWhen a person faints, it is usually due to a lack of blood to organs. On an EEG it shows up as a slowing down, followed by a flattening, and eventually a re-emergence to normal patterns. In behavioural terms, a patient twitches and becomes unresponsive for a few seconds. This is a clear case of a failure of the level subsystem while the rest of the architecture remains intact.\n\nPsychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin, increase brain activity and complexity and they tend to reduce the sense of self. Mebufotenin even offers, in certain rare cases, a meditation-like trance of pure awareness without the self or the world around.\n\nMeditation does not raise the level so much as tune access by reducing self-chatter in line with the Buddhist concept of anattā, or lack of a self. Seasoned practitioners can often achieve higher levels of synchrony through gamma waves.\n\nIn imaging studies, we can see a clear pattern: the mind wanders, the lapse is noticed, attention is redirected, and quiet returns. Psychedelics achieve pretty much the same, albeit temporarily, through biochemistry.\n\nThese examples at the edges of consciousness demonstrate that the same outward ‘lights off’ can arise via different component failures. Some drugs target arousal, while others affect routing or coordination. Conversely, ‘lights on’ can return through the restoration of a single or select few pathways. In that sense, consciousness behaves like a multi-component control system with bidirectional couplings (to and from the environment), feedback loops, and characteristic failure modes.\n\nWhat we have so far seen is that consciousness is fragile and it can be disabled through level and access subsystems with different outcomes. These are summarized in the table below.\n\nConsciousness: more than the sum of its parts\n\nSome of what humans do is accomplished without consciousness. Consider the jazz musician submerged in improvisation, whose fingers find the right notes before any conscious thought could guide them. Or consider the common experience of ‘highway hypnosis’ in which one arrives at a familiar destination with no memory of the journey, having navigated complex traffic unconsciously. These are not trivial functions; they are feats of incredible computational complexity, run by fast, efficient, and entirely nonphenomenal systems. As we master a skill, its execution migrates from the slow, energy-intensive prefrontal cortex to the lightning-fast, automated machinery of the basal ganglia and cerebellum. It is a triumph of evolutionary efficiency.\n\nThink of the brain as a metropolis at night. Neurons zip across the city like vehicles; it is busy even when we think the city sleeps. Consciousness is a motion picture narrated by the self that casts a spotlight onto a neighbourhood, a street corner, or the entire skyline. It is not factual newsreel footage, but a deeply personal snapshot of life in the metropolis that requires the various neighbourhoods to be powered up and connected through arterial roads and boulevards. The ‘now’ is a clever reconstruction, an audiovisual illusion of things as they were mere moments ago. It is an illusion so seamless no one ever notices it.\n\nIn this metaphor, level is the power grid. When we are awake, the city is brightly illuminated and busy. General anæsthesia is the equivalent of a city-wide blackout. Non-REM sleep matches a curfew, in which the lights may be on, but cross-town traffic is sparse. Access is the city’s news feed. When information is syndicated, it becomes available to many parts of the metropolis. Consciousness is not a single entity or located in a single spot. It is about functions and their connections. In Figure 1, the components of the consciousness system are shown. We shall explore the various components and links and tie them to the city-at-night metaphor to illustrate the purpose of each. It is based on insights from the edges of consciousness in humans and non-human animals; it is not tied to any single neural architecture.\n\nThe arousal/readiness component is the control room of the city’s power grid. When the voltage is high, the nightlife is vibrant and consciousness’ movie can capture whatever moment is of interest. When the voltage drops, entire blocks go dim and the narrator’s voice goes quiet. It can also raise or lower the brightness across neighbourhoods. Without arousal/readiness, people end up in sleeplike states, such as fainting spells or even a coma.\n\nAnatomically, arousal is handled by the brainstem and hypothalamus by means of orexin, which regulates arousal, wakefulness, and appetite. Norepinephrine sets the voltage levels across the entire city by focusing attention, while acetylcholine boosts incoming sensory transmissions.\n\nIn animals, we find similar brain structures. A single mutation in an orexin receptor causes narcolepsy in dogs, which shows that turning a single chemical key can switch off the lights in the dog park. Cephalopods cycle between quiet and active sleep that resembles REM, though with an entirely different neural architecture.\n\nRelay and synchrony are the traffic rules that coordinate remote regions to keep traffic flowing smoothly across the city. It is the precise timing that matters, not the magnitude or density of traffic (i.e. neuronal spikes). In humans, the thalamus acts as the brain’s clock. Failure in relay/synchrony leads to dissociation as in anæsthesia or ignition failures, in which a local representation never makes it outside the own neighbourhood.\n\nEven though birds lack a laminated neocortex, corvids exhibit the mind as a city: a systems view of consciousness 5 responses that mirror subjective detection, which implies a relay-like coordination in the pallium. While octopuses lack a mammalian thalamus, they show coordinated transitions: as they flip between active and quiet sleep modes, several brain regions’ rhythms alternate as if the octopus’ city re-timed all the traffic lights at once to reroute neural traffic. The implementations are all different, but the function is the same.\n\nWhile relay/synchrony enables the city to coordinate traffic across areas without gridlock, coordination is the actual infrastructure to do that: roads, signs, and traffic lights. In humans, the capacity to coordinate reflects large-scale dynamics right between order and disorder, the sweet spot between gridlock and chaotic traffic where neighbourhoods can synchronize when needed and desynchronize to explore. Evidence suggests that the cortex hovers near this criticality point to maximize flexibility in communication.\n\nVarious functional networks exist in the human brain that require long-range communication. For instance, the default mode network (DMN) is active during introspection, daydreaming, and memory recall. Dogs have an equivalent network as well as sensorimotor and auditory networks. The avian brain also has the hardware necessary for coordination, which proves that a cortex is not required.\n\nStreet cameras and microphones furnish the city’s live feed. Sensing supplies the streams that consciousness draws upon for the scenes in its movie of brain city. In the cortex, the primary sensory areas encode features for use in the entire city. When the data feed is offline, the city runs on guesses. That data feed combined with our expectations (i.e. priors) is used to forecast the ‘now.’ This now-casting improves sensory representations of the world around. The brain anticipates and corrects its now-casts as more sensory data arrives. Integration of sensory data feeds is common in all animals.\n\nIn humans and macaques, gamma waves carry sensory data forward while alpha and beta waves feed it back to shape the signal. In mice, similar band-specific feed-forward and feed-backward mechanisms for sensory information exist. Most of sensing is performed in the primary sensory cortices, insula, and brainstem nuclei.\n\nScene construction is done by the art department, specifically the set designer and continuity editor. They use the control room’s displays and loudspeakers to build a coherent shot from partial footage by filling in gaps or painting over seams so the experience feels seamless. A posterior ‘hot zone’ that crosses the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes is the conductor for dreams in the human brain. The orchestra, so to speak, is shared among many regions, such as the limbic system (emotions), the hippocampus (memories), temporal lobe (visuals), and frontal cortex, yet notably without the logical prefrontal cortex. Without the conductor, the orchestra does not play; the conductor alone is not sufficient to dream either. When scene construction fails, it can lead to dissociation of content that feels fragmented.\n\nScene construction is ultimately powered by prediction: the ‘now’ is the brain’s best guess of it, because sensory data is always delayed and only up to a few hundred milliseconds later available for conscious access. Without prediction, we would bump into each door frame, get hit by every ball, or crash a car into where it was a split-second ago.\n\nCuttlefish have episodic memory that combines the what, where, and when of events in the past with even the possibility of false memories due to errors in scene (re-)construction: their ‘now’ is stitched together after the fact rather than recorded live.\n\nThe access buffer is the jumbotron in the central square: when information hits the screen, the entire city can coordinate around it, as otherwise the footage remains local. Whatever is shown on it is only available briefly and the amount of content that can be displayed is limited, so it is a bit like a scratchpad. Experience without the access buffer leads to disconnected consciousness.\n\nThe access buffer is distributed across the prefrontal and parietal cortices, supported by sensory regions. Sedatives decrease the access buffer’s capacity, so that ultimately awareness cannot reach report/action. A similar structure can be found in birds and mammals.\n\nValuation and salience set the city’s priorities right now, for which the salience network is primarily responsible in humans. The component also acts as the switchboard for attention, as it patches communication between relevant regions as needed. In mammals, homologous networks have been observed. Birds and cephalopods set priorities via different circuits that are linked to motivation and action selection. A failure in this component leads to either apathy or extreme distractibility due to mis-prioritized contents.\n\nConsciousness’ film producer is the self-context, powered by the default mode network, for which homologues exist in dogs. With the aid of the valuation/salience component, it also narrates the motion picture. In case of failure of the self-context, depersonalization, out-of-body illusions, loss of agency, or anosognosia-like dissociations the mind as a city: a systems view of consciousness can occur. Internally, the self-context offers priors that bias internal decisions, whereas externally it is a communication interface.\n\nThis is supported by various philosophical traditions. Ubuntu’s maxim ‘I am because we are’ captures Menkiti’s conviction that personhood is constituted through communal life rather than conferred at birth. Hegel and Mead too believed that the self arises through social interactions and mutual recognition. In social species, a stable narrative self improves predictability and therefore trust.\n\nAvicenna imagined a man suspended in air and cut off from all sensations, not unlike someone inside a modern sensory deprivation tank. Such a floating man would still know that he exists, because self-awareness does not depend on the body or the world. It is a thought experiment designed to home in on the minimal conditions for consciousness, in which the self-context is isolated from all interfaces. It presupposes arousal/readiness to sustain awareness, but self-awareness survives even when sensing and report/action are stripped away, though relay/synchrony and coordination are, in the systems view, still needed.\n\nReport/action externalizes the scenes that have been selected in terms of actions, decisions, or communication. Language is a very efficient means, though need not be the only one, especially across species. In humans the prefrontal and premotor cortices translate accessible content into speech and motion, respectively. When there is no report/action, people are locked in themselves as if paralysed: they experience and are aware of their experiences, but they cannot act on them or talk about them. The ability to produce embodied actions from conscious content is present in all animals.\n\nThe world interface is the city’s connection to and from the outside world with sensors, actuators, and environmental feedback. Inner scenes can play in dreams across many species even though motor output is absent.\n\nThe connections can be subdivided into content and modulatory links. The former carry information payloads from one component to another, whereas the latter only alter what content is promoted or suppressed across regions through neuromodulators. Content moves on millisecond spikes, whereas neuromodulators act through biochemical diffusion processes. These are sometimes referred to as drivers and modulators.\n\nWhen we change modulation without affecting contents as in anæsthesia, we lower arousal and long-range communication in the brain. Likewise, when we alter the contents (e.g. binocular rivalry) while keeping the modulation the same, attention boosts the response of neurons that are tuned to the attended feature or location, thus sharpening the contrast without adding novel content. Similarly, when we stimulate the motor area in monkeys without any change in arousal, they can ‘see’ the motion. These demonstrate that the content/modulation split matches different dissociation mechanisms in the brains of various species.\n\nNishida argued that experience without a self is not only possible but pure: it occurs before the split between subject and object, which is exactly the link between scene construction and coordination\n\nFrom the world interface through sensing, scene construction, coordination, the access buffer, and report/action back to the world interface, the links carry content that stitches frames into a consistent audiovisual experience coloured by the self-context. It consists of the entire conscious feedback loop from sensory inputs to outputs, such as movement and speech.\n\nThe content link from coordination to the self-context updates the self model, and the modulatory link back biases information in the coordination component to be about the self. The latter does not carry new content.\n\nThere is also a link back from the world interface to report/action, although such reflexes are obviously not part of the consciousness system itself as they bypass it entirely.\n\nFrom arousal/readiness to everything else, the connections are neuromodulatory and involve norepinephrine, acetylcholine, histamine, serotonin, dopamine, and orexin.\n\nThe links from valuation/salience are also modulatory, as it prioritizes content for scene construction (amygdala and insula), the self-context (cingulate cortex), and coordination (salience network). This is mostly handled by reward systems.\n\nReport/action and sensing are connected by means of an efference copy, which is the internal duplicate of motion signals for comparison of sensory information to check whether the actual movement matches the desired one. Since no new content is fed back, it is modulatory.\n\nScene construction is modulated through relaying and synchronization. The same is true for coordination that depends on exact timings across brain regions.\n\nThe systems view offers falsifiable predictions. For instance, specific thalamo-cortical stimulation that restores relay/synchrony without raising arousal ought to restore report/action while under dexmedetomidine sedation, which disables the arousal/readiness component. In macaques, such stimulation awakens the cortex within seconds. Deep-brain stimulation of the central thalamus also improves responsiveness in humans with chronic disorders of consciousness. The idea is as follows: under stable anæsthesia, apply a centrallateral stimulation and check whether coherent report transiently returns. If it does indeed, relay/synchrony are as separate as the systems view claims; if not, it is not an independent lever.\n\nWe already know that we can zap the cortex and listen to the electrical echo, which is the essence of the PCI. What is missing is a sequential experiment within the same subjects: one session titrated to unresponsiveness with propofol and another with ketamine. In both cases, the PCI and directed connectivity (i.e. who drives whom) are to be recorded with a structured debrief on recovery about the stability of self and mental scene. If ketamine yields a high PCI with an unstable self while propofol yields a low PCI with simple or absent content in the same subjects, the systems view holds as there are two independent knobs to control consciousness through anæsthesia.\n\nFurthermore, a patch on the back of the cortex tracks whether people are dreaming. When it lights up in the right way, vivid reports follow upon awakening, even if the rest of the brain appears quiet. So, if that patch aids in building content, then a brief zap during non-REM sleep ought to shift people towards mentation without a surge in arousal. Once awake, we must collect the report. If we can selectively turn up scene construction while the level stays low, the systems view holds. If not, it suggests that content and level are less separable than the systems view claims.\n\nSimilar predictions and experiments can be designed to verify whether each component in the systems view is truly independent from the others. Likewise, we can construct experiments that check similar component-wise independence across species. That way, we can gradually refine the model and arrive at a minimal set of components required for consciousness in biological systems.\n\nTheories of mind and the systems view of consciousness\n\nThe systems view presented here unifies the clinical level and cognitive access that is based on insights from the edges of consciousness and various species. It explains why anæsthetics have different signatures rather than a single signature. We can even map concepts from various leading theories of mind to the systems view, upon which theories of mind stop being rivals and instead own a particular component, as shown in Table 2.\n\nAccording to the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), consciousness happens when a representation ‘ignites’ a long-range cortical network, so it becomes available for report, actions, and memory. The key region for GNWT is the prefrontal cortex.\n\nIntegrated Information Theory (IIT) proposes that consciousness arises from information integration. The quantity F measures the degree to which information is integrated, for which the posterior hot zone plays a key role. To have a non-zero value of F, all constituent matter must contain trace elements of consciousness, which leads to panpsychism as a prerequisite.\n\nA recent experiment pitted GNWT against IIT and found that neither explains consciousness satisfactorily. Particularly, the researchers found that consciousness arises even without sustained synchronization in the posterior cortex and without an ignition in the prefrontal cortex. Instead, we can map GNWT to the access buffer and both GNWT and IIT to coordination, as they both require broadcast or integration (i.e. coordination).\n\nIn Predictive processing (PP), the brain is a prediction machine: it generates models of the world and updates these by minimizing a prediction error, which is the difference between its guesses and sensory inputs. The entire control system in PP requires scene construction to generate predictions biased by valuation/salience, arousal/readiness to be able to generate and improve predictions, relay/synchrony for fast communication, coordination for inference over sensorimotor information, and the world interface to close the loop.\n\nRecurrent Processing Theory (RPT) says that feedback loops from sensory areas to higher-level cortical areas give rise to consciousness in thalamo-cortical loops. Features from sensory data are unconsciously extracted (e.g. shapes, colours, and motion), for which feedback from higher-level regions provides context (e.g. a face) that is again used to refine expectations in lower-level areas. Local recurrent processing is sufficient for consciousness, so that the access buffer and access consciousness through the prefrontal cortex are merely add-ons for report/action, not consciousness as a whole.\n\nWith Higher-Order Thought (HOT) theory, a mental state becomes conscious when an individual has a suitable higher-order representation of being in that state. Consciousness is thus meta-awareness. The self-context is the seat of consciousness in HOT, which is powered by the access buffer’s higher-order thoughts. Because the systems view talks about components and connections rather than specific anatomical locations, HOT can be mapped, even though it does not deal with a specific implementation in humans or other animals.\n\nEnactivism (En) posits that all cognition is embodied and thus shaped by sensorimotor actions: animals experience the world by exploring it and understanding the sensorimotor patterns their interactions generate. The world interface and report/action are therefore essential to its operation.\n\nThe systems view offers a blueprint for consciousness in silico based on what we know of it in vivo. It is the specific components, their functions, and their connections that give rise to consciousness, not the neural architecture or substrate; there is no magical separation between carbon and silicon. As such, artificial consciousness is a distinct possibility and falsifiable prediction.\n\nLarge generative models display rich scene construction, but they have no intrinsic arousal/readiness tied to a body: when switched off, they do not exhibit activity such as dreams. Their ‘sensing’ is optional. Report is their only output channel with no sense of self or valuation that matters to its integrity. In the case of robots, ‘sensing‘ is linked to an actual body and they can act as well as report, though artificial embodied experiences powered by multimodal models, such as Google’s RT-X Platform, are still nascent.\n\nA possible objection to consciousness as an emergent phenomenon is often voiced by proponents of IIT: how can consciousness arise from non-conscious matter? There is actually nothing mystical about emergent properties in systems. The motion of atoms and molecules generates heat, even though no atom or molecule has a ‘temperature’ as such. In a similar manner, traffic jams happen because of many cars acting and reacting in a dynamic system, even though no single car has a ‘traffic jamminess’ property. Traffic jams come about through interactions, inherent bottlenecks, and flow patterns, where a phase transition occurs that separates a smooth traffic flow from gridlock. Consciousness is, in the systems view, no more mysterious as system behaviour than traffic jams or heat.\n\nThe systems view offers a unique perspective on a classic puzzle, Theseus’ ship, which asks whether a ship that has every plank replaced one at a time remains the same ship. In minds, the analogue is a gradual neural replacement, which is intimately connected to the question of identity. All that matters in the systems view are the components’ functions and their interactions, not the material itself. So, as long as the planks are nailed together in the same way and they perform the same function as before, it is indeed the same ship. If we replaced all neurons with synthetic ones, but maintained the original connections, functions, and links, the mind would still be the same one.\n\nThe systems view matches the ‘fading and dancing qualia’ thought experiment: if qualia could drift (i.e. vanish or shift) without alterations to function, absurd transitions where reports and actions continue as before while the inner movie conflicts are possible. Since that is deemed implausible, a functional rather than material organization of consciousness is more reasonable.\n\nThe systems view turns Theseus’ ship from a paradox into an engineering challenge: with the right tools we can switch consciousness on or off and perhaps even engineer it into existence in artificial life forms. In that sense, Descartes’ evil demon is nothing but a neurosurgeon who can manipulate a patient’s mind through deep brain stimulation.\n\nPhilosophical zombies are functionally perfect facsimiles with no experience. The systems view refines the thought experiment, because it requires us to specify at which level functional duplication is performed. If it is done at the level of components and their connections, the systems view demotes philosophical zombies to unfalsifiable stipulations. Moreover, by probing the edges of consciousness, we can look for specific connections among components we can break (with anæsthetics) or remake (with stimulation) on demand. If zombies are possible, they are only so in a way that shows all the clinical signatures of consciousness yet lacks it altogether.\n\nThe systems view does not solve the hard problem, but it narrows it. Instead of asking why matter yields experience, it asks which specific causal links yield which families of experience. It does not settle all metaphysics, but it fences it in. The hard/easy divide and the explanatory gap still stand. What changes is where the gap is located and how narrow we can make it.\n\nFirst, the problem of phenomenal character becomes empirical. The self-context is a dedicated node within the systems view that monitors and models what the rest of the system is doing. Attention-schema theory and metacognitive models (e.g. HOT) purport that the brain maintains a simplified sketch of its own access and control. When we edit that sketch, people change what they report about awareness even when early sensory coding remains intact. This reframes the debate around qualia. At least part of the ineffable ‘feel’ is the output of a self-monitor that can be tweaked and tested. Any theory of mind must survive these reversible, component-specific interventions.\n\nSecond, once experience is tied to specific components, claims that phenomenal character floats freely above the consciousness system must account for why the same perturbations predictably erase or restore both signatures and reports.\n\nWhat is left of the hard problem is to explain why a particular state has a particular type of felt presence and why the system insists there is something beyond the obvious.\n\nConsciousness as a system is not a novel idea. Fazang’s golden lion teaches that the matter may be the same, but the relationships among the matter are what turn gold into a lion. Consciousness is the golden lion: it may be made out of neurons, dendrites, and axons, but it is the way these are wired up that gives rise to consciousness.\n\nWe even find echoes of the systems view among the Aztecs. In Nahua philosophy, each person is animated by three forces: tonalli (vigour), teyolía (identity, memory, knowledge), and ihíyotl (affect and desire). It was believed that tonalli could leave the body during sleep, which maps cleanly to arousal/readiness. Valuation/salience is equivalent to ihíyotl, whereas teyolía aligns itself roughly with scene construction, coordination, and the self-context, which together provide a coherent yet biased view of the world and the person in it.\n\nPhilosophical traditions from east and west, north and south, have all espoused consciousness as a system for centuries, though not in those words or with the specific components and connections as proposed here. It does suggest a convergent, systems-level understanding of the mind across cultures.\n\nThe systems view unpacks consciousness into a set of interacting functions whose disruptions map to measurable phenomena across drugs, injuries, and species. It shows why level and access are a useful clinical shorthand. More importantly, it reframes cross-species arguments on consciousness; it is about the components and connections, not a cortex.\n\nWhen we view consciousness not as a ghost in the machine but as the dynamic, functional organization of the machine itself, we gain five benefits. First, it is independent of the neural architecture or its substrate, so that it applies across species and even to artificial life forms. Second, it constrains philosophy. Any theory that denies a systems view must explain how individual components can be disabled selectively yet lead to different experiences. As such, it narrows the hard problem though it does not eliminate it. Third, various theories of mind can be mapped to the components of the system, which reduces rivalry and focuses instead on the merits in each idea. Fourth, we can ask better questions about the inner lives of animals and the ethical implications thereof. The Cambridge and New York declarations on consciousness are already a step in that direction. Like the systems view, these are informed by the latest science and philosophy. Fifth, it explains why current AIs are not imbued with consciousness while offering a blueprint for such artificial consciousness.\n\nWhile we still do not know the minimal set of components and connections needed to generate artificial consciousness in the lab, we do know enough to stop arguing about a single switch of consciousness and instead focus on the entire control panel. The task ahead is therefore to chart the wiring of the entire city of the mind.\n\n[1] Adeeti Aggarwal, Connor Brennan, Jennifer Luo, Helen Chung, Diego Contreras, Max B.

    "description": "Rox creates a unified context layer over an organization’s data by building a custom, proprietary knowledge graph for each organization. The graph models entities, relationships, and contextual signals in a single representation and serves as the foundation for agents that reason over private data.",
    "fullText": "Revenue teams today are surrounded by data, yet starved for actionable insight.\n\nVast amounts of customer and revenue data are generated across an ever-growing set of systems. Core business records live in CRMs and ERPs and are increasingly replicated to data warehouses. Product usage and activity data is captured as time-series events in data warehouses. Critical context is buried in unstructured sources such as emails, call transcripts, support tickets, and public internet data. While each system provides value on its own, the data within them remains siloed. Traditional analytics and BI tools operate within the boundaries of individual data sources, optimizing for aggregation and reporting rather than for understanding how data connects across systems.\n\nThe challenge is not data collection or storage—it is making sense of fragmented data in order to act on it. Revenue teams often struggle to form a coherent view of accounts, opportunities, and customer interactions. Important signals are scattered, context is lost, and answering simple questions often requires manual stitching across dashboards, queries, and conversations. This fragmentation slows decision-making and prevents teams from acting quickly on risk, growth, and opportunity.\n\nRox creates a unified context layer over an organization’s data by building a custom, proprietary knowledge graph for each organization. The graph models entities, relationships, and contextual signals in a single representation and serves as the foundation for agents that reason over private data.\n\nTo support this level of reasoning and flexibility, the knowledge graph must meet two foundational requirements: it must operate directly on enterprise data wherever it lives, and it must adapt to the unique way each organization models its business.\n\nThe Rox knowledge graph is warehouse-native by design. Organizational data remains in its existing systems—including data warehouses, operational databases, and external sources—while Rox provides the compute required to query and transform that data into a knowledge graph. No data is copied into Rox-controlled storage, ensuring that data ownership, access controls, and governance remain entirely within the organization’s environment. This architecture makes the system enterprise-ready by default and aligned with security and compliance requirements.\n\nApache Spark serves as the core compute engine for building the knowledge graph. Spark’s distributed execution model and connector ecosystem allow Rox to operate directly on customer data across a wide range of storage systems, including cloud data warehouses, operational databases, and open table formats.\n\nThe knowledge graph is refreshed through a recurring batch pipeline that runs every 30 minutes. Each run incrementally processes new records, applies updates, and removes stale data across all connected sources. This ensures that the graph stays in sync with upstream systems while avoiding overlapping executions and uncontrolled backlogs.\n\nAt scale, these pipelines process millions of entities and tens of millions of relationships per organization. Spark’s parallel processing, fault tolerance, and query optimization capabilities allow these workloads to complete reliably within the fixed batch window. As a result, Rox can continuously refresh large knowledge graphs on a predictable schedule while operating entirely within the customer’s data environment.\n\nEvery organization represents its data differently. The Rox knowledge graph is built to accommodate this reality through custom-defined mappings and relationships. Organizations define how their existing data models map into the Rox representation, allowing entities and attributes to reflect their specific schemas and business logic. Relationships are equally configurable, enabling teams to express how users, accounts, opportunities, and other entities connect in ways that mirror real operational needs. For example, hierarchical relationships can be defined to allow managers to view accounts and opportunities across their reporting structure. This flexibility ensures that each user sees the data that is relevant to them, modeled in a way that matches how the organization actually operates.\n\nGiven the schema definitions of a customer’s source tables, Rox allows users to define a one-to-one mapping into a unified Rox schema. These mappings specify how individual columns in source systems correspond to Rox entity attributes, including which fields act as stable identifiers. Data types are automatically inferred and normalized as part of this process, allowing source-specific representations to be cast into consistent formats (e.g. converting integers or strings into timestamps).\n\nOn top of these entity mappings, Rox supports explicit join relationships between data across different data systems. By defining which columns can be joined across tables, such as joining a contact table’s account_id field to the id field of an account table, these joins can be used to construct first-class relationships in the knowledge graph, making implicit connections in the source data explicit and queryable.\n\nBeyond basic joins, Rox also supports custom relationship definitions that encode business-specific semantics. For example, multiple relationships may exist between users and accounts, such as the owner of an account versus a solutions engineer supporting an account. These relationships allow the graph to capture not just that two entities are related, but how they are related. Subsets of these relationships can then be used to control visibility and relevance, such as building account assignment rules to determine which accounts a user should see and manage.\n\nAll mappings and relationships are evaluated dynamically. Queries over the knowledge graph are computed at runtime using the organization’s specific schema definitions, relationship rules, and access context. This allows Rox to present a consistent interface across organizations while respecting the unique structure, semantics, and operational logic of each customer’s data.\n\nEach knowledge graph build produces a unified Rox representation of entities and relationships computed at warehouse scale. The output consists of normalized tables for core entities—accounts, opportunities, contacts, and events—along with a relationship table that captures connections between entities. Each entity is assigned a stable Rox identifier while preserving its original source ID for traceability, stored in its own table.\n\nSpark is used to compute and materialize this representation directly in the data warehouse, leveraging distributed execution to process millions of entities and relationships efficiently. While the warehouse serves as the system of record for graph computation, powering interactive use cases requires low-latency reads and high concurrency.\n\nTo support this, the entities and relationships are ingested into Postgres as a serving layer optimized for real-time querying by both the UI and agents. Rather than reloading the entire graph on each build, Rox computes diffs between successive builds and applies only inserts, updates, and deletes to Postgres. This incremental approach minimizes data movement, avoids overlapping batch jobs, and keeps UI- and agent-facing data fresh and responsive.\n\nFor revenue teams, this architecture turns fragmented data into a living system of knowledge. Instead of stitching together dashboards, queries, and conversations, teams get a real-time, connected view of their customers that reflects how the business actually operates. By unifying data across sources and making relationships explicit, Rox enables faster understanding, better decisions, and timely action—unlocking value that was always present in the data, but never accessible.",

    "fullText": "The Sturmabteilung ([ˈʃtʊʁmʔapˌtaɪlʊŋ] ⓘ; SA; lit. 'Storm Division' or loosely 'stormtroopers') was the original paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party of Germany. It played a significant role in Hitler's rise to power in the 1920s and early 1930s. Its primary purposes were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of opposing parties, fighting against the paramilitary units of the opposing parties, especially the Roter Frontkämpferbund of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and intimidating Romani, trade unionists, and especially Jews.\n\nThe SA were colloquially called Brownshirts (Braunhemden) because of the colour of their uniform's shirts, similar to Benito Mussolini's Blackshirts. The official SA uniform was a brown shirt with a brown tie. The colour came about because a large shipment of Lettow-shirts, originally intended for the German colonial troops in Germany's former East Africa colony but which never reached its destination because of naval blockades,[3] was purchased in 1921 by Gerhard Roßbach for use by his Freikorps paramilitary unit. They were later used for his Schill Youth organization in Salzburg, and in 1924 were adopted by the Schill Youth in Germany.[4] The \"Schill Sportversand\" then became the main supplier for the SA's brown shirts. The SA developed pseudo-military titles for its members, with ranks that were later adopted by several other Nazi Party groups.\n\nAfter Hitler rose to Nazi Party leadership in 1921, he formalized the party's militant supporters into the SA as a group that was to protect party gatherings. In 1923, owing to his growing distrust of the SA, Hitler ordered the creation of a bodyguard unit, which was abolished after the failed Beer Hall Putsch later that year. Not long after Hitler's release from prison, he ordered the creation of another bodyguard unit in 1925 that ultimately became the Schutzstaffel (SS). During the Night of the Long Knives (die Nacht der langen Messer) purge in 1934, the SA's then-leader Ernst Röhm was arrested and executed. The SA continued to exist but lost almost all its influence and was effectively superseded by the SS, which took part in the purge. The SA remained in existence until after Nazi Germany's final capitulation to the Allies in 1945, after which it was disbanded and outlawed by the Allied Control Council.\n\nThe term Sturmabteilung predates the founding of the Nazi Party in 1919. Originally it was applied to the specialized assault troops of Imperial Germany in World War I who used infiltration tactics based on being organized into small squads of a few soldiers each. The first official German stormtrooper unit was authorized on March 2, 1915, on the Western Front. The German high command ordered the VIII Corps to form a detachment to test experimental weapons and develop tactics that could break the deadlock on the Western Front. On October 2, 1916, Generalquartiermeister Erich Ludendorff ordered all German armies in the west to form a battalion of stormtroopers.[5][page needed] They were first used during the 8th Army's siege of Riga, and again at the Battle of Caporetto. Wider use followed on the Western Front in the German spring offensive in March 1918, when Allied lines were successfully pushed back tens of kilometers.\n\nThe DAP (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, German Workers' Party) was formed in Munich in January 1919, and Adolf Hitler joined it in September of that year. His talents for speaking, publicity and propaganda were quickly recognized.[a] By early 1920 he had gained authority in the party, which changed its name to the NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or National Socialist German Workers' Party) in February 1920.[7] The party's executive committee added \"Socialist\" to the name over Hitler's objections, to help the party appeal to left-wing workers.[8]\n\nThe precursor to the Sturmabteilung had acted informally and on an ad hoc basis for some time before this. Hitler, with an eye to helping the party to grow through propaganda, convinced the leadership committee to invest in an advertisement in the Münchener Beobachter (later renamed the Völkischer Beobachter) for a mass meeting in the Hofbräuhaus, to be held in Munich on October 16, 1919. Some 70 people attended, and a second such meeting was advertised for November 13 in the Eberl-Bräu beer hall, also in Munich. About 130 people attended; there were hecklers, but Hitler's military friends promptly ejected them by force, and the agitators \"flew down the stairs with gashed heads\". The next year on February 24, he announced the party's Twenty-Five Point program at a mass meeting of some 2,000 people at the Hofbräuhaus. Protesters tried to shout Hitler down, but his former army companions, armed with rubber truncheons, ejected the dissenters. The basis for the SA had been formed.[9]\n\nA permanent group of party members, who would serve as the Saalschutzabteilung (meeting hall protection detachment) for the DAP, gathered around Emil Maurice after the February 1920 incident at the Hofbräuhaus. There was little organization or structure to this group. The group was also called the \"Stewards Troop\" (Ordnertruppen) around this time.[10] More than a year later, on August 3, 1921, Hitler redefined the group as the \"Gymnastic and Sports Division\" of the party (Turn- und Sportabteilung), perhaps to avoid trouble with the government.[11][12] It was by now well recognized as an appropriate, even necessary, function or organ of the party. The future SA developed by organizing and formalizing the groups of ex-soldiers and beer-hall brawlers who were to protect gatherings of the Nazi Party from disruptions from Social Democrats (SPD) and Communists (KPD), and to disrupt meetings of the other political parties. By September 1921 the name Sturmabteilung (SA) was being used informally for the group.[13] Hitler was the official head of the Nazi Party by this time.[b]\n\nThe Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich Hofbräuhaus on November 4, 1921, which attracted many Communists and other enemies of the Nazis. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a mêlée in which a small company of SA thrashed the opposition. The Nazis called this event the Saalschlacht (transl. Meeting hall battle), and it assumed legendary proportions in SA lore with the passage of time. Thereafter, the group was officially known as the Sturmabteilung.[13]\n\nThe leadership of the SA passed from Maurice to the young Hans Ulrich Klintzsch in this period. He had been a naval officer and a member of the Ehrhardt Brigade, which had taken part in the failed Kapp Putsch attempted coup. When he took over command of the SA, he was a member of the notorious Organisation Consul (OC).[c] The Nazis under Hitler began to adopt the more professional management techniques of the military.[13]\n\nIn 1922, the Nazi Party created a youth section, the Jugendbund, for young men between the ages of 14 and 18 years. Its successor, the Hitler Youth (Hitlerjugend or HJ), remained under SA command until May 1932. Hermann Göring joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing a speech by Hitler. He was given command of the SA as the Oberster SA-Führer in 1923.[15] He was later appointed an SA-Obergruppenführer (general) and held this rank on the SA rolls until 1945.\n\nFrom April 1924 until late February 1925, the SA was reorganized into a front organization known as the Frontbann to circumvent Bavaria's ban on the Nazi Party and its organs. (This had been instituted after the abortive Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923). While Hitler was in prison, Ernst Röhm helped to create the Frontbann as a legal alternative to the then-outlawed SA. In April 1924, Röhm had also been given authority by Hitler to rebuild the SA in any way he saw fit. When in April 1925 Hitler and Ludendorff disapproved of the proposals under which Röhm was prepared to integrate the 30,000-strong Frontbann into the SA, Röhm resigned from all political movements and military brigades on May 1, 1925. He felt great contempt for the \"legalistic\" path the party leaders wanted to follow and sought seclusion from public life.[16] Throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s, members of the SA were often involved in street fights, called Zusammenstöße (collisions), with members of the Communist Party (KPD). In 1929, the SA added a Motor Corps for better mobility and a faster mustering of units.[17] It also acquired an independent source of funds: royalties from its own Sturm Cigarette Company. Previously, the SA had been financially dependent on the party leadership, as it charged no membership fees;[18][19] the SA recruited particularly among the many unemployed in the economic crisis.[20] The SA used violence against shops and shopkeepers stocking competing cigarette brands; it also punished any SA member caught with non-Sturm cigarettes.[18][19] Sturm marketing was also used to make military service more appealing. Cigarettes were sold with collectible sets of images of historical German army uniforms.[21]\n\nIn September 1930, as a consequence of the Stennes revolt in Berlin, Hitler assumed supreme command of the SA as its new Oberster SA-Führer. He sent a personal request to Röhm, asking him to return to serve as the SA's chief of staff. Röhm accepted this offer and began his new assignment on January 5, 1931. He brought radical new ideas to the SA and appointed several close friends to its senior leadership.\n\nPreviously, the SA formations were subordinate to the Nazi Party leadership of each Gau. Röhm established new Gruppen that had no regional Nazi Party oversight. Each Gruppe extended over several regions and was commanded by a SA-Gruppenführer who answered only to Röhm or Hitler. Under Röhm as its popular leader and Stabschef (Staff Chief), the SA grew in importance within the Nazi power structure and expanded to have thousands of members. In the early 1930s, the Nazis expanded from an extremist fringe group to the largest political party in Germany, and the SA expanded with it. By January 1932, the SA numbered approximately 400,000.[22]\n\nMany of these stormtroopers believed in the strasserist promise of nazism. They expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy, once they obtained national power.[23] By the time Hitler assumed power in January 1933, SA membership had increased to approximately 2,000,000—twenty times as large as the number of troops and officers in the Reichswehr (German Army).[24]\n\nAfter Hitler and the Nazis obtained national power, the SA leadership also became increasingly eager for power. By the end of 1933, the SA numbered more than 3 million men, and many believed they were the replacement for the \"antiquated\" Reichswehr. Röhm's ideal was to absorb the army (then limited by law to no more than 100,000 men) into the SA, which would be a new \"people's army\". This deeply offended and alarmed the professional army leaders and threatened Hitler's goal of co-opting the Reichswehr. The SA's increasing power and ambitions also posed a threat to other Nazi leaders.[25] Originally an adjunct to the SA, the Schutzstaffel (SS) was placed under the control of Heinrich Himmler, in part to restrict the power of the SA and their leaders.[26] The younger SS had evolved to be more than a bodyguard unit for Hitler and demonstrated that it was better suited to carry out Hitler's policies, including those of a criminal nature.[27][28]\n\nAlthough some of the conflicts between the SS and SA were based on personal rivalries of leaders, the mass of members had key socio-economic differences and related conflicts. SS members generally came from the middle class, while the SA had its base among the unemployed and working class. Politically speaking, the SA was more radical than the SS, with its leaders arguing the Nazi revolution had not ended when Hitler achieved power, but rather needed to implement Strasserism in Germany. Hitler believed that the defiant and rebellious culture encouraged before the seizure of power had to give way to using these forces for community organization. But the SA members resented tasks such as canvassing and fundraising, considering them Kleinarbeit (\"legwork\"), which had typically been performed by women before the Nazi seizure of power.[29] Rudolf Diels, the first Gestapo chief, estimated that in 1933 Berlin, 70 percent of new SA recruits were former Communists.[30]\n\nIn 1933, General Werner von Blomberg, the Minister of Defence, and General Walter von Reichenau, the chief of the Reichswehr's Ministerial Department, became increasingly concerned about the growing power of the SA. Röhm had been given a seat on the National Defence Council and began to demand more say over military matters. On October 2, 1933, Röhm sent a letter to Reichenau that said: \"I regard the Reichswehr now only as a training school for the German people. The conduct of war, and therefore of mobilization as well, in the future is the task of the SA.\"[31]\n\nBlomberg and von Reichenau began to conspire with Göring and Himmler against Röhm and the SA. Himmler asked Reinhard Heydrich to assemble a dossier on Röhm. Heydrich recognized that for the SS to gain full national power, the SA had to be broken.[32] He manufactured evidence to suggest that Röhm had been paid 12 million marks by French agents to overthrow Hitler. Hitler liked Röhm and initially refused to believe the dossier provided by Heydrich. Röhm had been one of his first supporters and, without his ability to obtain army funds in the early days of the movement, it is unlikely that the Nazis would have ever become established. The SA under Röhm's leadership had also played a vital role in destroying the opposition during the elections of 1932 and 1933.\n\nHitler had his own reasons for wanting Röhm removed. Some of his powerful supporters had been complaining about Röhm for some time. The generals opposed Röhm's desire to have the SA, a force of by then over three million men, absorb the much smaller German Army into its ranks under his leadership.[32] Since the officers had developed the Reichswehr as a professional force of 100,000, they believed that it would be destroyed if merged with millions of untrained SA thugs.[33] Furthermore, the army commanders were greatly concerned about reports of a huge cache of weapons in the hands of SA members.[32] Industrialists, who had provided the funds for the Nazi victory, were unhappy with Röhm's socialistic views on the economy and his claims that the real revolution had still to take place. President Hindenburg informed Hitler in June 1934 that if a move to curb the SA was not forthcoming, he would dissolve the government and declare martial law.[34]\n\nHitler was also concerned that Röhm and the SA had the power to remove him as leader. Göring and Himmler played on this fear by constantly feeding Hitler with new information on Röhm's proposed coup. A masterstroke was to claim that Gregor Strasser, whom Hitler felt had betrayed him, was part of the planned conspiracy against him. With this news, Hitler ordered all the SA leaders to attend a meeting in the Hanselbauer Hotel[35] in Bad Wiessee.\n\nOn June 30, 1934, Hitler, accompanied by SS units, arrived at Bad Wiessee, where he personally placed Röhm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest. Over the next 48 hours, 200 other senior SA officers were arrested on the way to Wiessee. Many were shot and killed as soon as they were captured, but Hitler decided to pardon Röhm because of his past services to the movement. On July 1, after much pressure from Göring and Himmler, Hitler agreed that Röhm should die. Hitler insisted that Röhm should first be allowed to commit suicide. When Röhm refused to do so, he was shot by two SS officers, Theodor Eicke and Michael Lippert.[36] Though the names of 85 victims are known, estimates place the total number killed at between 150 and 200 men, the rest of whom remain unidentified.[37]\n\nSome Germans were shocked by the executions, but many others perceived Hitler to have restored \"order\" to the country. Goebbels' propaganda highlighted the \"Röhm-Putsch\" in the days that followed. The homosexuality of Röhm and other SA leaders was made public to add \"shock value\", although Hitler and other Nazi leaders had known for years about the sexuality of Röhm and other named SA leaders.[38]\n\nAfter the Night of the Long Knives, the SA continued to operate, under the leadership of Stabschef Viktor Lutze, but the group was significantly downsized. Within a year's time, the SA membership was reduced by more than 40%.[37] However, the Nazis increased attacks against Jews in the early 1930s and used the SA to carry these out.\n\nIn November 1938, after the assassination of German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Herschel Grynszpan (a Polish Jew), the SA was used for \"demonstrations\" against the act. In violent riots, members of the SA shattered the glass storefronts of about 7,500 Jewish stores and businesses. The events were referred to as Kristallnacht ('Night of Broken Glass', more literally 'Crystal Night').[39] Jewish homes were ransacked throughout Germany. This pogrom damaged, and in many cases destroyed, about 200 synagogues (constituting nearly all Germany had), many Jewish cemeteries, more than 7,000 Jewish shops, and 29 department stores. Some Jews were beaten to death and more than 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and taken to concentration camps.[40]\n\nThereafter, the SA became overshadowed by the SS; by 1939 it had little remaining significance in the Nazi Party, though it was never formally disbanded and continued to exist until the war ended. In January 1939, the role of the SA was officially established as a training school for the armed forces, with the establishment of the SA Wehrmannschaften (SA Military Units).[41] With the start of World War II in September 1939, the SA lost most of its remaining members to military service in the Wehrmacht (armed forces).[42]\n\nIn January 1941, long-standing rivalries between the Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office) and the SS exploded with the attempted coup d'état in Bucharest that saw SS back the coup by the Iron Guard under its leader Horia Sima against the Prime Minister, General Ion Antonescu, while the Auswärtiges Amt together with the Wehrmacht backed Antonescu. In the aftermath of the coup, the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop made an effort to curb the power of the SS to conduct a foreign policy independent of the Auswärtiges Amt. Taking an advantage of the long-standing rivalries between the SS and the SA, in 1941, Ribbentrop appointed an assemblage of SA men to head the German embassies in Eastern Europe, with Manfred Freiherr von Killinger going to Romania, Siegfried Kasche to Croatia, Adolf-Heinz Beckerle to Bulgaria, Dietrich von Jagow to Hungary, and Hanns Ludin to Slovakia in order to ensure that there would be minimal co-operation with the SS.[43] The role of the SA ambassadors was that of \"quasi-Reich governors\" as they aggressively supervised the internal affairs of the nations they were stationed in, making them very much unlike traditional ambassadors.[44] The SA leaders ambassadors fulfilled Ribbentrop's hopes in that all had distant relations with the SS, but as a group they were notably inept as diplomats with Beckerle being so crude and vulgar in his manners that King Boris III almost refused to allow him to present his credentials at the Vrana Palace.[43] As the ambassador in Bratislava, Ludin arranged the deportation of 50,000 Slovak Jews to Auschwitz in 1942.[45] On 23–24 August 1944, Killinger notably bungled the German response to King Michael I's Coup that saw King Michael I of Romania dismiss Antonescu, sign an armistice with the Allies, and declare war on Germany, thereby costing the Reich its largest source of oil.[46] Of the SA ambassadors, Killinger and Jagow committed suicide in 1944 and 1945 respectively while Kasche and Ludin were executed for war crimes in 1947 in Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia respectively. Beckerle spent 11 years in a Soviet POW camp, was released to West Germany in 1955, was charged with war crimes in 1966 for his role in the deportation of Macedonian Jews, which were dropped on grounds of ill health in 1968 and died in 1976 at a retirement home in West Germany.\n\nIn 1943, Viktor Lutze was killed in an automobile accident, and Wilhelm Schepmann was appointed as leader.[47] Schepmann did his best to run the SA for the remainder of the war, attempting to restore the group as a predominant force within the Nazi Party and to mend years of distrust and bad feelings between the SA and SS. On the night of 29–30 March 1945, Austrian SA members were involved in a death march of Hungarian Jews from a work camp at Engerau (modern Petržalka, Slovakia) to Bad Deutsch-Altenburg that saw 102 of the Jews being killed, being either shot or beaten to death.[48] In April 1945, Kreisstabsführer des Kremser Volkssturms (District Chief of Staff of the Krems Militia) and SA-Standartenführer (Colonel of the SA) Leo Pilz led a contingent of Volkssturm militiamen during the Stein Prison massacre, during which 400–500 prisoners were summarily executed.[49] Post-war, Pilz and four others were sentenced to death by the People's Court of Vienna.[50]\n\nThe SA ceased to exist in May 1945 when Nazi Germany collapsed. It was formally disbanded and outlawed by the Allied Control Council enacting Control Council Law No. 2 on October 10, 1945.[51] In 1946, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg formally ruled that the SA was not a criminal organization.[52]\n\nThe leader of the SA was known as the Oberster SA-Führer, translated as Supreme SA-Leader. The following men held this position:\n\nIn September 1930, to quell the Stennes Revolt and to try to ensure the personal loyalty of the SA to himself, Hitler assumed command of the entire organization and remained Oberster SA-Führer for the remainder of the group's existence until 1945. The day-to-day running of the SA was conducted by the Stabschef-SA (SA Chief of Staff), a position Hitler designated for Ernst Röhm.[55] After Hitler's assumption of the supreme command of the SA, it was the Stabschef-SA who was generally accepted as the Commander of the SA, acting in Hitler's name. The following personnel held the position of Stabschef-SA:\n\nThe SA was organized into several large regional Gruppen (\"Groups\"). The group leader answered only to the\nStabschef-SA or Hitler.[57] Each Gruppe was made up of subordinate\nBrigaden (\"Brigades\").[58] Subordinate to the Brigaden were the smaller regiment-sized Standarten.[58] SA-Standarten operated in every major German city and were split into even smaller units, known as Sturmbanne and Stürme.\n\nThe command nexus for the entire SA was the Oberste SA-Führung, located in Stuttgart. The SA supreme command had many sub-offices to handle supply, finance and recruiting.\n\nThe SA also had several military training units. The largest was the SA-Marine, which served as an auxiliary to the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) and performed search and rescue operations as well as harbor defense. The SA also had an \"army\" wing, similar to the Waffen-SS, known as Feldherrnhalle. This formation expanded from regimental size in 1940 to a fully-fledged armored corps (Panzerkorps Feldherrnhalle) in 1945. As for units formed outside of Germany, after the success of the invasion of Poland in 1939, an SA unit, \"Great Government\" was formed. The units were renamed SA Wehrschützen-Bereitschaften in 1942. The title was abbreviated to SA Wehrbereitschaften, thereafter.[59]\n\nIn his 1936 Hitler: A Biography, German historian Konrad Heiden remarked that within the SA ranks, there were \"large numbers of former Communists and Social Democrats\" and that \"many of the storm troops were called 'beefsteaks' – brown outside and red within.\"[60] The influx of non-Nazis into the Sturmabteilung membership was so prevalent that SA men would joke that \"In our storm troop there are three Nazis, but we shall soon have spewed them out.\"[60]\n\nThe number of \"beefsteaks\" was estimated to be large in some cities, especially in northern Germany, where the influence of Gregor Strasser and Strasserism was significant.[61] The head of the Gestapo from 1933 to 1934, Rudolf Diels, reported that \"70 percent\" of the new SA recruits in the city of Berlin had been communists.[30] This is evidenced further by historians, \"As for the prior youth group memberships, nearly half of the SS members and nearly one-third of the instant stormtroopers were with the Free Corps, vigilantes, or militant veterans' groups during their first 25 years of life. They also came in disproportionate numbers from left-wing youth groups such as the Socialist or Communist Youth or the Red Front (RFB).\"[62]\n\nHistorians have argued that since most SA members came from working-class families or were unemployed, they were more amenable to Marxist-leaning socialism, expecting Hitler to fulfill the 25-point National Socialist Program.[63] Historian Thomas Friedrich states that the repeated efforts by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) to appeal to the working-class backgrounds of the SA were \"doomed to failure\", because most SA men were focused on the nationalistic cult of Hitler and destroying the \"Marxist enemy\", a term that was used to identify both the KPD and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).[64]\n\nThe \"beefsteak\" name also referred to party-switching between Nazi and Communist party members, particularly involving those within the SA ranks.\n\nSimilar paramilitary organizations",

Instead of creating a character, you'll choose from specific heroes to play, and instead of venturing across the world mostly alone, you'll take on Nightreign cooperatively with up to two other players.\n\nFor some, a cooperative Elden Ring experience is right up their alley, but if you'd rather have the more lonesome, exploration-heavy, contemplative experience, Nightreign might not be for you. Luckily, there are a ton of other games that are like Elden Ring--those that conjure a similar feeling of setting out into a dark and hostile world, whether through their combat systems, dark and intriguing storytelling, or world design. Below, you'll find 24 RPGs, souls-like games, and open-world games that each capture elements of Elden Ring's gameplay, providing you with more tough battles to fight and incredible worlds to chart. These aren't necessarily meant to be duplicates of what Elden Ring is going for, but games that might appeal to those who like certain elements of it.\n\nAlternatively, we've got suggestions for the best RPGs and the best Elden Ring mods, the latter of which can expand and refresh your experience if you just want more Elden Ring.\n\nSucker Punch’s follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima moves the action up 300 years to the 17th century Ezo, as a female warrior, Atsu, dedicates herself to hunting down the Yotei Six who murdered her family and left her for dead.\n\nWith only two exceptions, Ghost of Yotei lets players choose which of the six she wants to target, and win. The game’s combat and open-world exploration should appeal to Elden Rings players, and this period of Japan’s history has been meticulously recreated. A player can lose themselves going through all of the side missions and finding the hidden secrets. The backgrounds are stunningly beautiful and the game is a worthy successor for the Ghost franchise.\n\nPlatforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC\n\nGame Science really elevated their game--so to speak--with Black Myth: Wukong, a beautifully rendered dive into Chinese mythology that loosely adapts Journey to the West. It’s not a fully open-world game, but Elden Ring fans should appreciate its soulslike aspects and the fantastic combat system. The Destined One’s staff turns out to be one of the most versatile weapons in the game, and it has plenty of tricks to master.\n\nThe Destined One is a humanoid monkey who is attempting to free his master from a trap that was set centuries earlier. That quest will take the Destined One across the country and into countless battles with enemies that stand in the way of his goal. Knocking the hell out of them with the staff is a good way to destress, but don’t get complacent. There are always harder battles to get through before the end.\n\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers is another soulslike title with a female warrior at the forefront. Bai Wuchang, however, has access to a deadly arsenal of weapons including multiple swords, dual blades, axes, and spears. If it’s sharp, she can use pretty much anything to kill her foes, and her combat options are like deadly poetry in motion. Even her defensive moves are impressive.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of this game is that Wuchang is infected with a virus that can transform its victims and drive them crazy. Players have to monitor Wuchang’s sanity and take steps to bring her back from the brink. Wuchang’s madness can also be a super power that temporarily makes her much stronger. But if her sanity is nearly depleted, it means her death won’t be far behind.\n\nHell Is Us breaks from the conventions of the other games on this list by setting its story in an alternative present that’s mired in supernatural threats. The main character, Remi, even uses a drone to help him distract his enemies. But when it comes to taking down Hollow Walkers, the old ways are best. That means swords, axes, and other melee weapons are the most effective tactics against these creatures.\n\nRemi’s story takes him back to his war-torn homeland as he attempts to locate the parents that he barely remembers. What he discovers is a deeper mission that will test him every aspect of his being. It turns out you can go home again, but no one ever said anything about leaving alive. The semi-open world around Remi has its own life to it, and he’ll need to talk with other survivors to figure out what he should do.\n\nThough not the first of From Software's games to use the formula, the Dark Souls trilogy crystalized the essential elements that make up Elden Ring, and went on to define an entire subgenre. It's the feel of Dark Souls that informs Elden Ring, as well as so many other games that have come after it. Combat is slow and methodical, requiring you to pick your moments to attack as you learn how to deal with powerful opponents that can easily destroy you if you're not smart and careful. The combination of melee mechanics with a stamina gauge, a health system that gives you a limited quantity of healing items you can continually refill, and a checkpoint system that forces you to choose between replenishing yourself and reviving all the creatures you just defeated, have led to so many games borrowing its ideas that it has given rise to its own genre: the Soulslike.\n\nThe original Dark Souls is really the quintessential game, taking players through tough battles against a variety of fantastical bosses, and features an incredibly interesting and interconnected world. It's not exactly an open-world game--it hides a pretty linear experience--but it feels huge, open, and strange, and the sense of exploring that world is part of what has made Dark Souls so powerfully influential for more than a decade. Dark Souls 2 and 3 expand on and refine the experience in different ways to offer iterations on the theme that are both worth exploring, especially to see how they would eventually give rise to Elden Ring.\n\nFanatical is owned by GameSpot parent company Fandom.\n\nThe Dark Souls games (and Demon's Souls) hew closest to Elden Ring's approach to things like combat and healing. In terms of a vast open world where exploration is just as big a part of the experience as following the prescribed path, however, it's hard to find a better example than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom. Both games reimagine the classic Zelda framework of melee combat, dungeon-crawling, and amassing a huge inventory of weapons and tools to make your way in the world, with an expansive open world that gives way to a much more free-form experience. Just as you can set out in any direction in Elden Ring and find a viable path through the game, you can wander both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and chart your own way through Hyrule. You'll be hard-pressed to find any other games that capture Elden Ring's sense of open possibility the way these do.\n\nThe quickest way to understand Remnant 2 would be \"Dark Souls with guns,\" although especially with Remnant 2, that description is a big disservice. Remnant 2 uses key elements of the souls-like formula, like finite healing items that can be replenished, a stamina gauge for dodging away from enemy attacks, and checkpoints that revive enemies in the area around you, but it expands on it in a ton of meaningful ways. Most notably, Remnant 2 makes use of an impressive procedural generation system that mixes in bespoke elements, making unpredictable maps that are filled with intricate, well-designed dungeons. It also has a series of phenomenal, often-massive boss fights, each different from the last and interesting in its own unique way. However, it's in its secrets that Remnant 2 really excels--the procedural generation elements mean you can play the same dungeon over and over and discover new elements each time, like hidden rooms, additional battles, and alternate ways to defeat bosses. The best way to experience Remnant 2 is in co-op, thanks to a system that rewards you for mixing and matching different classes and working together to explore its constantly changing world.\n\nBloodborne takes the more linear approach generally inherent to the Dark Souls games and gives it a faster pace, while setting it in a bloody Lovecraftian horror tale. There's a reason Bloodborne is the favorite of From Software's oeuvre among many fans--it's an often-brilliant iteration on the core ideas. Bloodborne does away with the slower elements of the Souls games, like blocking with a shield, in favor of dodging, parrying, and a health-rally system that rewards you for being aggressive by letting you gain back health lost to enemies by pressing the attack. Even better than that, though, is a dark and twisting story about a plague that turns people into horrific beasts, which you're tasked with stopping as you take part in the blood-drenched Hunt, only to discover that there are forces beyond your comprehension at work in the cursed land of Yharnam.\n\nWhere Bloodborne iterated on From's approach with faster and more aggressive gameplay, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice brought that line of thinking to its ultimate conclusion with a game that demands you never back down from a fight. In Sekiro, every battle is a duel, whether you're fighting a samurai general or a towering ape. It introduces a \"posture\" system, which rewards you for pressing the attack and perfectly parrying your opponent's strikes by staggering them and opening them up for a massive, deadly blow. Sekiro is also From's most narrative-driven game, taking you through a tragic story set during Japan's Sengoku period, and adds stealth mechanics and platforming to the formula to create something unique among From's catalog.\n\nRise of the Ronin takes a stab at combat similar to Elden Ring--it's maybe \n\nIt's tough to think of an open-world RPG without thinking immediately of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Bethesda's incredibly popular game has been ported basically everywhere, and endures more than 10 years later because it puts players in a vast world with a huge amount of things to discover. Defined by first-person combat that includes dual-wielding weapons and magic spells, Skyrim has an absolutely enormous number of things to do and find, and stories to uncover and take part in. It stands as the gold standard of Bethesda's approach to games and has been hugely influential on open-world titles and RPGs ever since. Plus, it has an expansive, robust modding scene on PC that adds to and remakes the game in a phenomenal number of ways, just in case getting lost in the northern reaches of Tamriel for hundreds of hours wasn't enough for you.\n\nA lot of developers have tried to replicate the feel of a From Software Souls game, but none have ever quite managed it. Few have gotten as close as Neowiz Games with Lies of P, though. A riff on the story of Pinnochio, Lies of P is a little bit like if Bloodborne was set a little further in the future and focused on killer clockwork automata instead of werewolf-like monsters, but with a hearty helping of Sekiro's parry-focused approach to combat and weaponry. The game excels in fast-paced dueling combat, especially in its many killer boss fights. It's also set in a dark, fantastical world and explores some fascinating ideas of personhood in between all the beat-downs you give both robots and other \"humans.\"\n\nThe 2018 reboot of God of War reworked its gameplay in some significant ways, not the least of which is a \"wide linear\" focus on exploration that puts you not quite in an open world, but not quite in a fully linear experience, either. That approach provides a lot of Norse mythology-inspired places to explore, where you'll uncover fascinating stories and quite a few tough mythological creatures that need walloping. Reworked combat tightens the series' combo-centric battles against lots of enemies to make for some tougher duels, and God of War and its sequel, Ragnarok, have evolved to be \n\nMortal Shell is an indie souls-like game very obviously inspired by the Dark Souls approach, with a haltingly told story and a dark and shadowy fantasy world. Its tough combat is very similar to what the Souls games turn out, but with a few tweaks that might make it a good introduction to the genre. Two elements define Mortal Shell: the ability to inhabit the bodies of fallen soldiers to take on their different capabilities, kind of like choosing a class, and the ability to \"harden\" your body and tank a hit from an enemy. The harden ability is the key to Mortal Shell's combat, as it allows you to bait your opponent into attacking and then capitalize on the opening their blow bouncing off you creates. Mortal Shell is a smaller-scale souls-like than most, but it does a great job of dialing in on a few key elements that make these games so engaging while fleshing them out very well.\n\nTitanfall and Apex Legends' developer Respawn Entertainment's take on Star Wars is more than a little Souls-y. The series, now two games deep, tells the story of a Jedi hiding out in the aftermath of the Jedi Purge from Revenge of the Sith, before he sets out with a band of misfits to take on the Galactic Empire. Lots of games put you in the role of a Jedi, but Respawn's mixture of souls-like influence does a better job of making that compelling than most--instead of just slicing through everything with your laser sword, you're forced to use skills and reflexes, as well as the Force, as you fight tough duels against opponents ranging from Purge Troopers to Rancors to Sith Inquisitors. The Jedi games also add metroidvania elements and large areas to explore on various planets, scratching your exploration and puzzle-solving itch as well.\n\nIn some ways, Ghost of Tsushima is to Sekiro what Elden Ring is to Dark Souls: It plays in similar ways, but brings elements of Sekiro to an open-world format. Those elements are mainly a big focus on stealth assassinations and intense dueling gameplay. Ghost of Tsushima strikes out in its own direction with an emphasis on fighting stances--using the right stance against the enemy you face is essential to success--but a big focus is on parrying blows and knocking enemies off-guard so you can land your strikes. While its open world is more traditional than Elden Ring's, with lots of characters to talk to and side quests to complete, its minimalist presentation helps it capture that sense of wide-reaching exploration that makes From Software's game so engaging.\n\nThough souls-like games are often defined by their combat, the more effervescent element of the Elden Ring experience is the sense of scale and discovery it can often portray, as you ride over a hill and discover something incredible--often towering in the distance and waiting to kill you. That's the experience of Shadow of the Colossus to a T. You venture into a beautifully realized but ultimately lonely world filled with staggering, enormous monsters--only to destroy them. Shadow of the Colossus nails a sense of vastness that is empty and ponderous, something that also marks the best moments of Elden Ring, and excels at making you feel like you've just stumbled on something ancient and inscrutable. Its minimalist narrative makes the most of that world, as well as its awe-inspiring creatures, to capture a feeling few other games ever manage.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is revered as one of the best open-world RPGs made in the last decade, if not longer. It expands on CD Projekt's Witcher series in just about every way, from placing you in a truly huge game world full of well-told stories and side quests, to deepening combat and exploration. The gist is still the same--you're monster-hunter Geralt, a strong fighter with a handful of impressive special abilities and access to magic powers. And it's in fighting its various monsters that The Witcher 3 really hits a stride, pitting you against fantastical beasts that are all weird, deadly, and challenging in their own ways. Beyond that, though, its world is filled with quests that are worth taking and tales that are worth unfolding. The way The Witcher 3 lets you get to know the world and take part in it, and shows you the beauty and tragedy found within, elevates it beyond most RPGs.\n\nHollow Knight is a pretty big departure from Elden Ring, as games on this list go. It's not a 3D open-world game or an RPG--it's a side-scrolling metroidvania. But like a lot of other games on this list, it nails the sense of exploration through a strange world full of long and sometimes tragic history. It also draws from the souls-like formula for its combat, distilling some of those elements into 2D battles against a huge host of bosses. The combination of tough battles, a dark and expansive world through which you chart your own path, and an incredible amount of atmosphere and intriguing world-building give Hollow Knight a similar feel to what makes Elden Ring so enticing.\n\nThe Horizon games are \n\nOne of the joys of Elden Ring is just setting out in a direction and seeing what's out there. In Dragon's Dogma 2, just about any venture away from the safety of a settlement is met less with fascinating things to discover like hidden caves or underground cities, and more with unpredictable chaos in the form of the various vicious and magical creatures that want to make a meal out of you. The unpredictable ways these systems can interact with each other is the joy of Dragon's Dogma 2--as is hanging out with the miscreant \"pawns,\" companion characters you and other players create. Sharing them with pals you can't join in-game gives Dragon's Dogma a multiplayer feel similar to Elden Ring that goes perfectly with a fun open world where the journey is always as important as the destination.\n\nThe Nioh games were the result of developer Team Ninja combining its pedigree for fast, intense combat with souls-like mechanics. A lot of the familiar elements are present, like your offensive and defensive moves being governed by a stamina system. Team Ninja riffed on that underlying idea, creating an approach to stamina that also works in strategic planning in the midst of combat, along with precise timing, to make sure you can keep your stamina up and survive the onslaught of your foes. With clever bosses and winding level design, the Nioh games take souls-like ideas off in new directions to create some fresh but familiar experiences.\n\nYou'll immediately recognize the souls-like elements in combat in No Rest For The Wicked, with the usual stamina system, dodge-rolls, and parries. The differences are in its presentation: No Rest For The Wicked is an isometric dungeon-crawler, making it feel something like Dark Souls via Diablo. Each new weapon you find offers different move sets that will drastically change your approaches to combat, which offers a lot of variety in battles and gameplay as you take on some tough and often huge bosses. No Rest For The Wicked is set in its own dark fantasy world that's equal parts strange, fascinating, and horrifying, making it very interesting to venture through and fight to survive within.\n\nTeam Ninja riffs on the souls-like formula again in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, but goes in a different direction. It experiments with different ideas, allowing you more opportunities to customize a character and to build into different stats and gameplay approaches as you level up. Choosing different weapons and sets of armor, and hot-swapping between weapons on the fly, lets you change your fighting style whenever you want, offering a lot of versatility for Sekiro-style, parry-heavy battles. Wo Long also makes some interesting tweaks to the souls-like formula--instead of having to run back to where you died in order to reclaim what you lost there, for instance, you now have to face down whatever killed you. The result is a feeling of fighting out a series of battles and duels that have an element of rivalry baked in. Making your way through Wo Long's world isn't just about leveling up, but about staking a claim on each new piece of the map, turning exploration into a system that makes you stronger.\n\nDrawing inspirations from both From Software's games and Team Ninja's Nioh series, The First Berserker: Khazan does what those games do well: intense fights against huge, intense bosses. Khazan will scratch the itch for difficult combat against interesting enemies, especially with its unique art style and weapon-specific upgrade trees that give you incentives to lean into a specific combat style. The game is also part of the Dungeon & Fighter universe, so while it won't give you a huge open world full of lore to explore, there are deeper narrative underpinnings to intrigue fans of the franchise.\n\nInstead of going to the past or to a fantastical world, The Surge 2 takes place in a dystopian sci-fi future. Rogue robots threaten the world, and you'll face a variety of enemies both human and mechanical in a bid for survival. The Surge 2's melee combat adds a new dimension to the usual souls-like formula by allowing you to hack off specific limbs or parts of your foes in order to loot their weapons, armor, or items. If you're looking for an action-RPG that goes the apocalyptic future route rather than toward fantasy tropes, The Surge 2 will give you a whole new ruined world to explore.\n\nIf you're looking for more story and anime influence in your souls-like, Code Vein has you covered. Set in a world ravaged by a cataclysm that has resurrected the dead as vampire-like people called Revenants, you play an amnesiac character with a special ability--where other Revenants have what is essentially a single class called a Blood Code, you're able to compile and swap between many different Blood Codes and the special abilities that come with them. You'll use your vampiric powers to battle other Revenants after they've transformed into hideous monsters in an effort to save those who remain from a similar fate.\n\nWhile Diablo's combat is more oriented toward managing special abilities and cooldowns than it's geared toward dealing with stamina and parries, there's still a lot of similar DNA between it and Elden Ring. The Diablo series originated the RPG loot chase that defines so many games these days, and there's plenty of mechanical satisfaction in constantly chasing greater power. Diablo IV's story and world also play up the horror elements that often infuse Elden Ring, giving you a strange and terrible world to explore, along with massive, challenging bosses to defeat.",

Executors got the most love from this update, with increased attack power, guard boost, stagger damage, and reduced stamina reduction when using the \"Cursed Sword\" character skill. Executors also received a handful of other buffs as well.\n\nThis update was primarily focused on balance adjustments for Relics, Equipment, Sorcery, and Incantations, as well as a long list of bug fixes that went with them.

    "title": "Suspended Ford Worker Who Was Flipped Off By Trump Made So Much Money On GoFundMe He Paused Donations",
    "description": "Two six-figure crowdfunding campaigns saw thousands of individual donations for the Ford factory worker.",
    "fullText": "President Trump giving the middle-finger to a Ford employee who apparently calls it like he sees it seems to be the best thing that has ever happened to him — financially at least. TJ Sabula, a 40-year old United Auto Workers Local 600 line worker, was quickly suspended with pay by Ford after heckling the President while he was visiting one of its factories in Michigan (the President, in turn, flipped him the bird and apparently mouthed \"F**k you.\") But, soon after, a pair of GoFundMe pages were set up for Sabula and they took off like wildfire.\n\nAs of mid-morning on January 15, the pair of campaigns for Sabula have raised $811,010 from nearly 35,000 separate donations. Sabula, seeming to be a stand-up guy, actually decided to stop accepting donations, indicating he and his family had more than enough.\n\nIn an update on one of the pages, Sabula wrote, \"We greatly appreciate the outpouring of support! At this time we are closing donations to this campaign and encourage you to look for other causes and organizations to support. We appreciate every single donation, comment, share, and sign of support!\" The other page had a similar message and said it was also closing donations. I'm not sure I'm big enough to ever stop taking free money, but good for him.\n\nOf course, Trump didn't just pick a random guy out of the crowd to cuss out, though it wouldn't be that surprising. Sabula reportedly called Trump a \"pedophile protector\" during his visit to the Michigan F-150 factory. The Department of Justice faces criticisms as to the speed it has released the Epstein files–along with the redactions being made to the documents–which must be made public in compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nIn any case, as we previously reported, Trump's White House didn't try to cover up or downplay what the President did, instead telling the Washington Post that \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"\n\nSabula told The Post that he has \"no regrets whatsoever,\" though he did add that he feels concerned about the future of his job and believes he has been \"targeted for political retribution\" for \"embarrassing Trump in front of his friends.\"\n\nIt's still unclear what Sabula's future with Ford will be, but at the very least the $800,000+ he's gotten from GoFundMe will help lighten the blow. On top of that, he's got the backing of the UAW. The union posted this on its website:\n\nThe autoworker at the Dearborn Truck Plant is a proud member of a strong and fighting union —the UAW. He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\n\nThe UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member. Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone—including the President of the United States.\n\nThat's certainly the type of union representation we all deserve.\n\nSabula has also received support from U.S. Rep Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, who represents Detroit, calling him a \"national hero,\" according to the Detroit Free Press. Former U.S. Secretary of Transportation and fellow Michigander Pete Buttigieg has also voiced his support.\n\nNot everyone was on board, though, including Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford, who earlier in the visit said meeting the president was \"the experience of a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Discipline is in the hands of the organization. It's unfortunate and 99% of the employees in the plant were great and I was embarrassed because we're the host. But that was six seconds out of an hour tour and the tour went great.\"\n\nCrowdfunding campaigns can often get people all riled up about someone being rewarded for \"bad behavior\": In early 2025, a woman in Minnesota was caught calling a child a racist slur on a playground and then made over $800,000 on GoFundMe-alike site GiveSendGo, according to NBC News. That woman was charged with three counts of disorderly conduct by the City of Rochester, with a trial set to begin in August 2026, ABC 6 News reports.\n\nWant more like this?

    "description": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "fullText": "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 \n\nBut some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket — roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap — could save as much as $1,320 per person.\n\n\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 — that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"\n\nThe $670 figure is based on a 2025 analysis by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.\n\nThe tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.\n\n\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"\n\nAARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.\n\nWho qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?\n\nPeople who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction, according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.\n\nThe tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.\n\nThe deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.\n\nIndividuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",

    "description": "Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez explains why a new wave of earnings from the semiconductor sector signals the AI race is just warming up.",
    "fullText": "The AI supercycle is far from exhausted, and semiconductor companies like industry titan TSMC (TSM) are among the catalysts to watch.\n\n\"This earnings report, really more than anything, supports the idea that [the AI boom] is going to continue to move forward,\" Victoria Fernandez, chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments, told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid.\n\nAccording to Fernandez, the great \"rotation\" out of Big Tech might finally \"start to slow down a little bit.\" While market skeptics spent the past quarter betting on a broad exit from the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a new wave of earnings from the semiconductor sector signals \"there are more legs\" to the AI race.\n\nOther key players to watch include ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Lam Research (LRCX), as Fernandez points to the firms' respective \"strong earnings.\"\n\nThat renewed optimism is largely due to a fundamental shift in how the market views the picks and shovels of the AI era. For months, investors feared that AI demand might be a bubble nearing its burst. However, the latest data from these four companies — which build the hardware for Big Tech — tells a different story of rising capital expenditures, expanding margins, and relentless sales growth.\n\nLeading that charge is TSMC, the world's most critical chip foundry, which dominates advanced chip production for giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).\n\nTSMC kicked off the new year by delivering blockbuster Q4 earnings today. For the period, revenue came in at $33.73 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase, beating consensus estimates of $32.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Earnings per share reached $3.15, up 8% year over year, surpassing the expected $2.90. TSMC stock has risen over 70% in the past year.\n\nThe company announced it had earmarked up to $56 billion in capital expenditures for 2026. This aggressive spending plan acts as a massive \"buy\" signal for the entire supply chain, per Fernandez, suggesting that the world's biggest tech players are doubling down on infrastructure, rather than pulling back.\n\nThe higher-for-longer spending cycle has revitalized the three other key suppliers. Take ASML, the sole provider of the lithography machines required to make advanced AI chips. Its market cap surged past the $500 billion mark on the back of TSMC's news. Shares of ASML are up over 80% in the past 12 months.\n\nThe support for these suppliers was visible in premarket trading, where Applied Materials and Lam Research shares were up 8% and 6%, respectively. These companies represent the infrastructure layer that must be built before any software-based AI gains can be realized.",

(AP) — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against California that sought detailed voting records and personal data on its 23 million registered voters, concluding that the government's request was “unprecedented and illegal.”\n\nThe Trump administration's lawsuit, filed last year, contended that California and other states were illegally blocking the federal government's wide-ranging effort to scrutinize detailed voter data that states said was private and protected.\n\nThe administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.\n\nFurthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.\n\n“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nIt has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.\n\nState election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.\n\nCalifornia Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",

    "fullText": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt absolutely lost it on The Hill’s Niall Stanage on Thursday after he accused the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee Good of acting “recklessly.”\n\nThe exchange began with a query from Stanage:\n\nYou were just defending ICE agents generally, and earlier on Secretary Noem spoke to the media and she said among other things that they are doing everything correctly. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, 170 U.S. citizens were detained by ICE, and Renee Good was shot in the head and killed by an ICE agent. How does that equate to them doing everything correctly?\n\nLeavitt responded with a question of her own: “Why was Renee Good unfortunately and tragically killed?”\n\n“Are you asking me my opinion?” asked Stanage before giving his answer: “Because an ICE agent acted recklessly and killed her unjustifiably.”\n\n“Oh, okay, so you’re a biased reporter with a left-wing opinion,” shot back Leavitt, which prompted Stanage to wonder, “What do you want me to do?”\n\nYeah, because you’re left-wing hack! You’re not a reporter, you’re posing in this room as a journalist, and it’s so clear by the premise of your question. And you and the people in the media who have such biases, but fake like you’re journalists, you shouldn’t even be sitting in that seat. But you’re pretending like you’re a journalist, but you’re a left-wing activist, and the question that you just raised and your answer proves your bias.\n\nYou should be reporting on the facts. You should be reporting on cases. Do you have the numbers of how many American citizens were killed at the hands of illegal aliens who ICE is trying to remove from this country? I bet you don’t. I bet didn’t even read up on those stories. I bet, you never even read about Laken Riley, or Jocelyn Nungaray, or all of the innocent Americans who were killed at the hands of illegal aliens in this country. And the brave men and women of ICE are doing everything in their power to remove those heinous individuals and make our communities safer. And shame on people like you in the media who have a crooked view, and have a biased view, and pretend like you’re a real honest journalist.\n\nThe post ‘You’re a Left-Wing Hack!’ Karoline Leavitt EXPLODES on Columnist Who Accused ICE Agent Who Shot Renee Good of Acting ‘Recklessly’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "One man is recalling a fight for his life that all started with a tiny mosquito.\n\nIn 2007, Glendale, Arizona, resident David Hancock started feeling very sick with a sudden fever and vomiting. By the time he made it to the hospital, it took doctors 10 days to diagnose him. In the meantime, he fell into a coma, suffered heart failure, his lungs filled with fluid, and his brain became inflamed.\n\n\"I was on the other side, with one foot in the other world,\" he told Deutsche Welle, which summarized his experience with West Nile virus, a disease that can be transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite.\n\nWhile most people who contract West Nile virus may never know it, one in five will experience body aches and other flu-like symptoms, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Others, like Hancock, suffer much more worrisome outcomes. Each year, more than 1,300 Americans who have contracted West Nile develop severe illness that affects the central nervous system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 130 of those end up dying, the agency adds.\n\nMeanwhile, cases of West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, and Zika are increasing, as rising global temperatures help mosquitoes to move into new territories and lengthen their active seasons. Many U.S. localities experienced surges in West Nile virus this year: Bell County in Texas reported six positive tests in six weeks, a spike in cases in one part of Utah led to one death, and the number of cases reported across the country in September was 40% higher than usual.\n\nOne of the most important things that anyone can do to avoid getting sick is to prevent mosquito bites. The CDC recommends using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellants; wearing long, loose-fitting clothing when you're outside and treating it with permethrin; and taking measures to control mosquitoes inside and outside the home.\n\nMany agencies assist with mosquito control efforts by spraying throughout local communities when needed. Some cities and counties are taking a more creative approach to mosquito control, too. For instance, one Florida county is using X-rays to sterilize male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This species can carry a number of mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue and Zika.\n\nHow bad are the mosquitoes in your area?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Kyrsten Sinema divided Democrats during her time in the U.S. Senate. Now she’s accused of dividing a husband and wife, too.\n\nThe former Arizona senator is accused of having an extramarital affair with her bodyguard while in office—an alleged relationship that ultimately led to the collapse of a 14-year marriage, according to a federal lawsuit filed by the bodyguard’s ex-wife.\n\nFiled in North Carolina, the suit alleges that Sinema, 49, engaged in lengthy, sultry text exchanges with her former bodyguard, Matthew Ammel, including sending photos of herself wrapped in a towel and suggesting that he bring MDMA on a work trip so she could “guide him through a psychedelic experience.”\n\nHeather Ammel, Matthew’s ex-wife, is suing Sinema for alienation of affection, a controversial North Carolina law that allows a person to be held liable for malicious interference in a marriage.\n\nRoughly a year after Matthew joined Sinema’s security detail, the head of her security team departed and warned him that Sinema “was having sexual relations with other security members,” according to the complaint.\n\nHeather alleges that Matthew suffered from mental health challenges stemming from his service in the U.S. Army, and that Sinema exploited his vulnerability to grow closer to him—at one point promising to “help him” work through his struggles. Heather says she later discovered scores of sexually charged messages between Matthew and the prominent centrist Democrat on the encrypted messaging app Signal. Sinema announced in March 2024 that she would not seek re-election.\n\nThe lawsuit further claims that Sinema paid for Matthew’s psychedelic treatments, brought him to a wedding, and showered him with gifts: took him on international vacations, to a Taylor Swift concert, and allegedly purchased a Theragun so she could “work on his back.”\n\nIn June 2024, Sinema allegedly offered Matthew a paid staff position in her Senate office as a Defense and National Security fellow, where he worked as her subordinate.\n\nAround that time, Heather says she confronted Sinema after seeing a message on Matthew’s phone that read: “I miss you. Putting my hand on your heart. I’ll see you soon.”\n\nHeather responded directly, writing: “are you having an affair with my husband? You took a married man away from his family.”\n\n“Prior to [Sinema’s] deliberate interference in the marriage, genuine love and affection existed between [the couple],” the lawsuit states.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Sinema’s representatives for comment. Matthew Ammel could not be reached for comment.\n\nMatthew filed for divorce earlier this month, TheAssemblyNC reported.\n\nDuring her Senate tenure, Sinema was known as a centrist Democrat whose closest relationships in Congress were often with Republicans rather than members of her own party. She frequently drew criticism from the left, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who told Stephen Colbert, “I will not miss Senator Sinema,” after she announced she would not seek reelection.\n\nSinema, now a political adviser at D.C. law firm Hogan Lovells, cited frustration with the state of American politics as one reason for her decision, saying: “Despite modernizing our infrastructure, ensuring clean water, delivering good jobs and safer communities, Americans still choose to retreat farther to their partisan corners.” She added that compromise had become a “dirty word.”",

    "description": "A shriek broke the dawn on the savannah, followed by more screeches and the rustle of branches: The wild Fongoli chimps were bidding each other good morning in the dry, scraggly Sahel.The Fongoli chimps \"have to deal with the hottest area that we've studied chimps in\" Pruetz said, and must \"minimise energy expenditure\" during the dry season.",
    "fullText": "A shriek broke the dawn on the savannah, followed by more screeches and the rustle of branches: The wild Fongoli chimps were bidding each other good morning in the dry, scraggly Sahel.\n\nThe rare chimpanzees -- who live in the bush of hot, southeast Senegal rather than the forest as is more common -- exist on the extreme edge of what is possible for their species.\n\nTheir unusual way of living offers clues into humans' own evolutionary past, while their adaptations to the heat appear timely in a world where temperatures are on the rise.\n\nSoaking in pools, cooling off in caves and even wielding spears: The 35 wild chimps of the Fongoli community have adapted to the environment with behaviours that defy their species' conventional norms.\n\nNow, 25 years after starting her pioneering research on savannah chimps, which had never before been habituated to observers, primatologist Jill Pruetz has a wealth of data.\n\nThe study's longevity allows for a deeper dive into the Fongoli community's behaviours, relationships and how they learn from one generation to the next.\n\n\"Until they were habituated to observers so we could follow them around and take data, we only knew chimpanzees from forested areas,\" Pruetz told AFP reporters, who spent two days following her and her team as they tracked the primates in the bush.\n\nThe Fongoli chimps, who live on a 100-square-kilometre (40-square-mile) home range, are only one group of savannah chimps in the region but for years the only one to be studied.\n\nOn a recent morning, A.J., Raffy, Diouf and ambitious young Pistache sat at the top of a baobab, plucking a breakfast of fruit that they cracked open with a whack-whack-whack against the branches.\n\nScreeching, or \"pant-hooting\" as their vocalisations are known, they communicated with other members nearby.\n\nPruetz and her team of Senegalese researchers follow the group's adult males, which currently number 10, choosing one each day to track from dawn to dusk. The females, however, are not followed in order to keep them more wary of poachers.\n\nThe males' strict hierarchy spans from Cy, the alpha, down to Siberut, the oldest and lowest ranking despite his superb hunting skills.\n\nSince the social apes spend much of their time together, Pruetz is still able to observe the females and their young.\n\nIt is the females who have proven the most groundbreaking members of the clan: They are the only non-human animal to systematically use tools to hunt.\n\nIt is a behaviour Pruetz and her researchers have observed almost 600 times.\n\nAfter whittling sticks into spears, usually with their teeth, the females hunt bush babies during the rainy season, impaling the small primates as they shelter in tree holes.\n\nWith the heat index reaching 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) in the hot season, life on the savannah can be gruelling.\n\nThe Fongoli chimps \"have to deal with the hottest area that we've studied chimps in\" Pruetz said, and must \"minimise energy expenditure\" during the dry season.\n\nThey are the only wild chimps in the world known to soak, taking dips in natural pools. They additionally \"use caves to rest in, because the caves are cooler\", Pruetz told AFP.\n\nThe savannah woodlands that are the Fongoli chimps' habitat are similar to those that human ancestors lived in some six or seven million years ago.\n\nWhile the Fongoli chimps' many adaptations mean they are able to deal with \"high heat stress\", Pruetz said, \"we're not sure that with climate change they can continue to do that\".\n\nThe Fongoli apes are members of the critically endangered subspecies of West African chimpanzees.\n\nWhile they have traditionally co-existed alongside humans on their home range, a new threat has emerged: a gold rush which has ushered an increase in both artisanal and industrial mines.\n\nIn the morning, the rumble of rock-grinding machines, which crush through buckets of substrate, could be heard before the savannah's fauna began its daily chorus.\n\nFires burned at artisanal mine sites, where night guards watched over equipment.\n\nMines can mean water pollution, greater resource extraction and the spread of human disease to chimps.\n\nPapa Ibnou Ndiaye, a wildlife researcher and professor at Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, said studying the Fongoli chimpanzees allows \"the local administration to have accurate information to make informed decisions for the conservation of Senegal's biodiversity\".\n\nPruetz spends part of the year teaching at Texas State University, while her four research assistants and project manager, who are originally from nearby villages, continue to track the apes.\n\nThey keep count as Raffy whacks a baobab fruit eight times or note which arm he uses to do so -- although chimps are normally left-handed.\n\nBut they also meticulously track the chimps' friendships and social plights.\n\n\"When someone gets home from being out with the chimps all day, you sit around the supper table and you talk about, what drama? What did Cy do today? What did Pistache do today?\" said Pruetz, who has images of three of the chimp group's deceased or disappeared members tattooed on her arm.\n\nChimpanzees can live up to 50 years in the wild and how their \"relationships change\" is just one of the many interests for Pruetz.",

    "fullText": "A U.S. citizen on her way to a medical appointment in Minneapolis was dragged out of her car and detained by immigration officers, according to a statement released by the woman on Thursday, after a video of her arrest drew millions of views on social media.\n\nAliya Rahman said she was brought to a detention center where she was denied medical care and lost consciousness. The Department of Homeland Security said she was an agitator who was obstructing ICE agents conducting arrests in the area.\n\nThat video is the latest in a deluge of online content that documents an intensifying immigration crackdown across the midwestern city, as thousands of federal agents execute arrests amid protests in what local officials have likened to a \"federal invasion.”\n\nRahman said that she was on her way to a routine appointment at the Traumatic Brain Injury Center when she encountered federal immigration agents at an intersection. Video appears to show federal immigration agents shouting commands over a cacophony of whistles, car horns and screams from protesters.\n\nIn the video, one masked agent smashes Rahman's passenger side window while others cut her seatbelt and drag her out of the car through the driver's side door. Numerous guards then carried her by her arms and legs towards an ICE vehicle.\n\n“I'm disabled trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I didn't move,” Rahman said, gesturing down the street as officers pulled her arms behind her back.\n\nRahman was caught in a “terrible and confusing position” and had “no where to go,” according to Alexa Van Brunt, Rahman's attorney and director of the MacArthur Justice Center.\n\n“Her only options were to move her car forward in the direction of ICE officers and risk being accused of trying to harm them—which led to Renee Good’s death—or stay stationary, which in the end led to physical violence and abuse,” Van Brunt wrote in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security disputed that account in an emailed statement on Thursday, saying that Rahman was an agitator who “ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene.” She was arrested along with six other people the department called agitators, one of whom was accused of jumping on an officer's back.\n\nThe department did not specify if Rahman was charged or respond to questions about her assertion that she was denied medical treatment.\n\nBarrage of viral videos draw scrutiny\n\nThe video of Rahman's arrest is one of many that have garnered millions of views in recent days — and been scrutinized amid conflicting accounts from federal officials and civilian eyewitnesses.\n\nOften, what's in dispute pertains to what happened just before or just after a given recording. But many contain common themes: Protesters blowing whistles, yelling or honking horns. Immigration officers breaking vehicle windows, using pepper spray on protesters and warning observers not to follow them through public spaces. Immigrants and citizens alike forcibly pulled from cars, stores or homes and detained for hours, days or longer.\n\nIn one video, heavily armed immigration agents used a battering ram to break through the front door of Garrison Gibson’s Minneapolis home, where his wife and 9-year-old child also were inside. The video shot inside the home captures a woman’s voice asking, “Where is the warrant?” and, “Can you put the guns down? There is kids in this house.”\n\nAnother video shows ICE agents, including Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, detain two employees at a Target store in Richfield, Minnesota. Both are U.S. citizens who were later released, according to social media posts from family members.\n\nMonica Bicking, 40, was leaving the homeless shelter where she works as a nurse when she took a video that appears to show a federal agent kneeing a man at least five times in the face while several other agents pin him facedown on the pavement in south Minneapolis.\n\nBicking works full time, so she says she doesn’t intentionally attend organized protests or confrontations with ICE. But she has started to carry a whistle in case she encounters ICE agents on her way to work or while running errands, which she says has become commonplace in recent weeks.\n\n“We’re hypervigilant every time we leave our houses, looking for ICE, trying to protect our neighbors, trying to support our neighbors, who are now just on lockdown,” Bicking said.\n\nRahman said in her statement that after her detainment, she felt lucky to be alive.\n\n“Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled,\" Rahman said.\n\nWhile in custody, Rahman said she repeatedly asked for a doctor, but was instead taken to the detention center.\n\n“It was not until I lost consciousness in my cell that I was finally taken to a hospital,” Rahman said.\n\nRahman was treated for injuries consistent with assault, according to her counsel, and has been released from the hospital.\n\nShe thanked the emergency department staff for their care.\n\n“They gave me hope when I thought I was going to die.”",

    "fullText": "Ashley St. Clair, who gave birth to one of Elon Musk's sons in 2024, sued Musk's xAI in a New York court on Thursday, alleging that its chatbot Grok generated sexually explicit deepfake images of her at users' request.\n\nIn the complaint, St. Clair, a writer, influencer, and political strategist, claims X users prompted Grok to manipulate images of her, including photos from when she was 14, into graphic sexual content. She alleges some images remained online for more than a week and that her premium X account was later terminated after she complained.\n\nShe is also requesting a temporary restraining order to compel xAI to immediately cease from \"the intentional disclosure of nonconsensual intimate images.\"\n\nxAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Grok first promised Ms. St. Clair that it would refrain from manufacturing more images unclothing her,\" the complaint read. \"Instead, Defendant retaliated against her, demonetizing her X account and generating multitudes more images of her,\" the suit alleged.\n\nSt. Clair is also involved in a separate suit with Musk over the custody of their son, in which she sought sole custody.\n\nxAI responded the same day with a separate lawsuit, arguing that St. Clair agreed to its terms of service, which requires any litigation to be heard in Texas. St. Clair is represented by attorney Carrie Goldberg, who specializes in cases involving abuse and has represented clients against Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\"xAI is not a reasonably safe product,\" Goldberg said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This harm flowed directly from deliberate design choices that enabled Grok to be used as a tool of harassment and humiliation. Companies should not be able to escape responsibility when the products they build predictably cause this kind of harm.\"\n\nThe lawsuit followed international backlash against the Grok chatbot for its ability to undress images of real people and create sexualized images without their consent at users' request.\n\nIndonesia and Malaysia blocked access to Grok, while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called explicit images generated by Grok \"disgusting\" and \"shameful\" in a meeting with the House of Commons.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta also announced that his office is investigating the \"non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online\" of \"women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations.\"\n\nX said on the same day in a blog post that users would no longer be allowed to create AI photos of real people in sexualized or revealing clothing on the platform, adding that the restriction \"applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Business Insider reporter Henry Chandonnet found that it is still \"surprisingly easy\" to prompt Grok to create nude images of him by going to the app itself instead of using the Grok chatbot on X.",

    "fullText": "French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that his country has now overtaken the US as the main provider of intelligence to Ukraine.\n\n\"Where Ukraine was overwhelmingly dependent on American intelligence capacity, a year ago, two-thirds is today provided by France. Two-thirds,\" Macron said in a New Year's speech to the French military.\n\nThe French leader's comments indicate a shift in the dynamics of Western contributions to the war and suggest that the US may have scaled back its military relationship with Ukraine.\n\nThe US briefly suspended intelligence-sharing and aid to Ukraine in March 2025, as the Trump administration was attempting to negotiate a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow. After roughly a week, Washington said it was lifting the suspension.\n\nBut it's been unclear so far whether the Pentagon has continued to provide intelligence at the same level as it did during the Biden administration.\n\nThe New York Times previously reported that, in those years, US-Ukrainian intelligence-sharing ties had been so close that officials from both countries worked in the same facility to coordinate military strikes.\n\nOne of the most vital roles played by US intelligence at the time was providing targeting data and situational awareness for Ukrainian troops, especially when the latter were using American-made systems for the attacks.\n\nUkraine has since been trying to develop its own strike capabilities, including long-range precision missiles, that might allow it to strike Russia without Western approval.\n\nIt's also unclear exactly how Macron quantified two-thirds of Ukrainian intelligence capabilities. His speech did not say whether he was referring to two-thirds of the intelligence provided by Ukraine's foreign partners or to two-thirds of all the intelligence used by Ukraine's forces.\n\nThe Élysée Palace and French defense ministry did not respond to requests for comment sent outside regular business hours. Ukraine's defense ministry and the Pentagon have also not responded to similar requests for comment on Macron's remarks.\n\nThe French president's point on intelligence-sharing with Ukraine aligns with his larger push to position Paris as a regional military leader, while the Trump administration seeks to curb American involvement in Europe. President Donald Trump has also recently rattled European leaders by alluding that the US could try to take over Greenland, a Danish territory.\n\nMacron said on Thursday that France had helped Ukraine to rebuild its forces and provided Kyiv with security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire.\n\nLast week, European NATO members and the US issued a declaration that said willing countries would form a multinational, \"European-led\" force to provide \"reassurances\" to Ukraine and stave off a second Russian invasion or attack.\n\n\"The signal sent to our Ukrainian partners, to other Europeans, and to the world is that we are ready,\" Macron said. \"We are ready to sustain this effort of resistance. We are ready to deter new aggressions or to maintain peace on our soil.\"",

    "description": "Motolani Adedipe moved to South Korea for a year on a Fulbright scholarship. She brought her two kids along while her husband remained in the US.",
    "fullText": "When Motolani Adedipe moved from Oklahoma to Seoul, South Korea, in August, she didn't just pack her suitcase — she brought along her 6-year-old daughter, newborn baby, and mom.\n\nAdedipe, who is from Nigeria and moved to the US to attend grad school in Texas, first grew curious about South Korea while interning at a biotech firm in Boston, where she shared an apartment with a Korean roommate.\n\n\"For that summer, I ate a lot of Korean food. She put me on K-dramas,\" Adedipe, now 39, told Business Insider. That early curiosity soon grew into an interest in Korea's history, economy, and language.\n\nAdedipe began learning Korean nine years ago online and continued after she moved to Oklahoma for work, where she became an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.\n\nIn September 2024, Adedipe applied for a Fulbright scholarship to extend her research in prostate cancer survivorship. She already knew she wanted to go to South Korea — even as she prepared to give birth to her second child that November.\n\nShe made it through the first review in December, but when months passed with no update, she figured she hadn't made it. So when the acceptance came through in April, the moment felt surreal.\n\n\"It was like the best news and almost the worst news at the same time. Best because finally I get to do this. But of course, the anxiety, how do we start planning now?\" Adedipe said.\n\nThankfully, her family was supportive, especially her husband.\n\n\"It required faith, sacrifice, structure, and for both of us to really imagine a life that looked very different from what we had planned,\" she said.\n\nHer physician husband couldn't accompany her to South Korea, but they agreed that she would bring both daughters along.\n\n\"How many of her peers would ever say, 'Oh, I took a gap year in Korea'?\" she said, referring to their 6-year-old.\n\nKnowing the scholarship would last just one year made the decision easier. Her husband has visited them in South Korea several times and plans to make more trips over the coming months.\n\n\"I saw it as an opportunity for my children to experience another culture, language, and way of life, while still having a clear sense of return,\" Adedipe said.\n\nNow, she homeschools her daughter in the morning before sending her to a \"hagwon,\" a type of private academy that many Korean students attend after school.\n\n\"Not all of her friends speak English, so they kind of communicate through play,\" she said.\n\nAdedipe's mom, who had traveled to Oklahoma to help out with the kids, joined them in Seoul.\n\nAs she searched for housing, Adedipe had a long checklist: enough space for her family, easy access to the subway, flat streets her mother, in her early 60s, could navigate, and a neighborhood that felt safe for kids.\n\nShe found a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment in Mapo-gu, a district in western Seoul home to several universities.\n\nAlthough the apartment was smaller than she initially hoped for, it turned out to be a great fit: It's surrounded by greenery and about a 30-minute commute to her workplace.\n\nHer scholarship includes a housing stipend that covers her rent, which she declined to share.\n\nPer the latest December data from the Korea Real Estate Board, the median monthly rent for an apartment in Mapo-gu is 1.39 million Korean won, or about $940.\n\nAdedipe says her schedule varies from week to week, but her work typically starts in the afternoons. She goes into her office at Seoul National University Hospital several times a week, while continuing to supervise her lab in Oklahoma remotely at night.\n\nData from the Ministry of Justice showed that the number of foreigners living in South Korea at the end of 2024 stood at 2.65 million, a 5.7% increase from the previous year.\n\nA US veteran who had retired in South Korea previously told Business Insider that he appreciated the country's safety and culture of respect. Meanwhile, a millennial who moved from Switzerland to Seoul said she valued the convenience of city life, including how most stores stay open late.\n\nOne of the biggest adjustments, Adedipe said, has been the extent to which technology is deeply woven into daily life in Seoul. Nearly everything is tied to having a registered phone number.\n\n\"Once I got my card and I got a bank account and I got a phone number that was registered, life became easy,\" she said.\n\nEven though the city is known for its fast-paced lifestyle, Adedipe says she's been surprised by its human side.\n\n\"I lost my stylus in the bus, and I was able to get it back. It was tagged, and they verified they found it. That could never happen in the US,\" she said.\n\nWatching her daughter flourish and adapt to their life in Seoul has been especially meaningful.\n\n\"Now that I'm seeing where she's shining. My goal is to keep encouraging her to find her passion in life and do that,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to learning Korean, her daughter takes part in extracurricular activities, such as piano, inline skating, and Taekwondo.\n\n\"She's doing everything that I never could have been able to give her because in Oklahoma, if you're doing all those classes, you have to drive your kids to all those classes,\" she said. \"But here in Korea, because of how the education is structured, she does all of that in a school, and she loves it.\"\n\nLiving abroad with her mother has brought them closer. After leaving Nigeria for the US in her 20s, Adedipe went nearly eight years without seeing her mom because of visa issues.\n\n\"And now that I get to live with her again, it's like a dream come true,\" she said.\n\nLooking back on her own experience, Adedipe says living and working in South Korea has felt like a \"full circle moment,\" after years of interest in the country.\n\n\"It felt like all the pieces of my life — research, storytelling, culture, and well-being — were suddenly being invited into the same room,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

    "fullText": "Cubs could move Matt Shaw to the outfield after Alex Bregman signing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs have been aggressive in recent weeks, trading for Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera and signing former Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox infielder Alex Bregman to a five-year $175 million contract.\n\nIf the Cubs retain Nico Hoerner, there won't be space for Matt Shaw to play everyday in the infield. That said, Chicago Cubs president Jed Hoyer proposed a different solution.\n\nAccording to Jesse Rogers of ESPN, Hoyer hinted at the idea of playing Shaw in the outfield in order to get in the lineup more often.\n\nAlthough he doesn't have big league experience in the outfield, right field seems to be the best fit. Pete Crow-Armstrong and Ian Happ are known to play exceptional defense in both center and right field. Happ has won four consecutive Gold Glove awards while Crow-Armstrong won his first last season.\n\nAssuming Kyle Tucker departs in free agency, Shaw could split time with Seiya Suzuki in right. Suzuki only made 48 appearances in the outfield last season, but posted negative two defensive runs saved at the position in 2024.\n\nShaw splitting time at the position could relieve Suzuki from time to time and keep him in a more comfortable position at designated hitter. He excelled in this role last season, hitting a career-high 32 home runs and driving in 103 runs.\n\nEither way, Shaw could get time at second base if Hoerner is traded, something that Chicago has yet to take off the table.\n\nNevertheless, adding the outfield to his repertoire will make him a more versatile piece for the Cubs moving forward.\n\nPhillies linked to slugger with over 200 career home runs\n\nGiants linked to add Marlins' starter via trade\n\nGiants reveal contract guarantees and bonuses for new starter Tyler Mahle\n\nAthletics agree to extension with Tyler Soderstrom after breakout season\n\nAthletics eye rotation upgrades after Jeff McNeil trade\n\nHa-Seong Kim returns to the Braves on a one-year contract\n\nSan Francisco has 'checked in on' Cody Bellinger amid free agency",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots and Houston Texans will look to bring themselves one step closer to ultimate glory in their divisional round matchup on Sunday.\n\nI’ve put together the keys to victory for both sides:\n\nThe Texans’ defensive style is legitimately fascinating, as they ranked first in total defensive EPA (-130.69) and points allowed per game (16.7) while also ranking dead last in blitz rate (21.6%) and simulated pressure rate (29.7%) — all while playing more man-coverage (67.9%) and single-high coverage (74.8%) than anyone in 2025.\n\nKamari Lassiter, Jalen Pitre, Danielle Hunter, Derek Stingley Jr. and Will Anderson Jr. make it pretty easy to take those risks…\n\nI don’t necessarily know if there’s a way to “take advantage” given that group’s undeniable talent, but if there was it would involve trusting the league’s most accurate deep-ball quarterback to exploit that loyalty to simplicity.\n\nDrake Maye isn’t your typical sophomore signal-caller, but there are aspects to his game that need to be cleaned up.\n\nMaye’s unwillingness to accept defeat on individual plays is an issue, and it came back to bite him in the ass during last weekend’s wild-card victory over the Los Angeles Chargers — leading to two fumbles on five sacks.\n\nHouston defensive coordinator Matt Burke won’t stray from what made his defense the best in football, but perhaps making slight schematic changes can throw a wrench in things and present them with a few opportunities to take advantage of one of the youngster’s few bad habits.\n\nJosh McDaniels has plenty of friends down in Houston, Texas.\n\nTexans general manager Nick Caserio, offensive coordinator Nick Caserio, special teams coordinator Frank Ross, offensive line coach Cole Popovich, offensive assistant Jerry Schuplinski and wide receivers coach Ben McDaniels — you can put two and two together on that one — previously worked with the guy, so they know exactly what he’s capable of and most comfortable with doing.\n\nI’d expect there to be a few wrinkles in the offensive gameplan — perhaps we see the Wing-T or the Wildcat. I just don’t think we’ll see that tired old flea flicker, the double pass, or that quarterback throwback he seems to be obsessed with.\n\nIt’s a simple formula; build an early lead, run the football, watch your defense dominate.\n\nThe Texans have been built to do exactly that, but the only way it works is if you’re able to run the ball effectively. Woody Marks, Nick Chubb, Jawhar Jordan, Dare Ogunbowale and British Brooks have combined for precisely two 100-yards games in 2025, but one of those came in their wild-card victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers…\n\nFrom the goal line to midfield!\n\nBig gain for Rhamondre Stevenson 😤\n\nLACvsNE on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/8VkxijZMq0\n\n“If you want to control the game, you have to win on first downs.”\n\nNo, if you want to control this game, you have to win on second down.\n\nHouston is the best second-down defense in football, as they force an average of eight yards to gain on third downs. New England needs to stay ahead of the chains, but especially on second down as it will allow for more options on third downs.\n\nWill Campbell and Jared Wilson didn’t exactly have the best postseason debuts, giving up four sacks and 10 total pressures, and things are only going to get more difficult against a unit that ranked first in opponent passer rating (75.0), third in opponent completion percentage (58.92%) and eighth in sack percentage (7.59%).\n\nI’d say it’s a bit of a mismatch…\n\nDerek Barnett, Denico Autry, Sheldon Rankins, Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. are pressure machines, but they’ll need to finish in order to actually make a difference in this one. Drake Maye finished with a 102.6 passer rating when under pressure in 2025.\n\nIf you’re going to stop him, you have to get home.\n\nAdam Schefter Delivers Fiery Take On Eagles’ A.J.

That's ridiculous.\n\nAnd for Maurice Jones-Drew, in his top 64 starting running backs piece for NFL.com, Henry came in at No. 6.\n\n“Other than some early-season fumbling issues, Henry had one hell of a season at 31 years old,” Jones-Drew wrote. “The ageless wonder continued to trounce defenses and finished the season with an absolute bang, rushing for 570 yards and six touchdowns on 85 carries over the final four games.\n\n\"That's 6.7 per clip.

    "fullText": "Bruised and battle-hardened, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills face Denver on Saturday as their star quarterback seeks to reach his first Super Bowl and add the NFL's biggest prize to his list of accolades.\n\nThe league's reigning Most Valuable Player suffered a head blow, a sprained knee and a hand injury in last weekend's hard-fought clash with Jacksonville, but almost single-handedly dragged his team over the line.\n\nNow, Allen has been cleared fit to play against the Broncos -- the AFC's top seed -- in their highly anticipated divisional round game, knowing victory would leave them just one win away from next month's NFL championship decider.\n\n\"I feel good. Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks,\" Allen, who has also been managing a long-term foot injury, told a press conference.\n\nAllen's run of 122 consecutive starts is the longest streak among active quarterbacks and has led to his teammates and fans jokingly referring to him as \"Superman.\"\n\nBut the quarterback, who hails from the agricultural Central Valley of California, told reporters his toughness came from being a \"country boy\" from \"out in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that the defensive line he will be facing is notoriously robust.\n\n\"They've got some absolute studs over there. Obviously they rush the passer extremely well,\" said Allen.\n\n\"Interior, again, some big stout guys that can really push the pocket.\"\n\nFor Denver, the match-up comes after a bye week, and offers another chance to prove that one of this season's surprise packages can be the real deal at the business end of the campaign.\n\nDespite finishing top of the AFC with the league's joint best record (14-3), the Broncos figure only fifth on the betting market's predicted Super Bowl winners.\n\nStar cornerback Pat Surtain said the team would be relying on a raucous crowd to spur them on for the Broncos' first postseason home game since 2015.\n\n\"I know the atmosphere is going to be crazy, the stadium is going to be rocking,\" Surtain said.\n\n\"I can already feel the magnitude of it,\" he added.\n\nIt is also a chance for the Broncos to avenge last year's devastating 31-7 playoff loss in Buffalo.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, the injury-ravaged San Francisco 49ers will attempt the next step in their bid to reach a home-field Super Bowl by taking on the high-flying Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe clash pits the two divisional rivals against each other for the second time in three weeks.\n\nAs top seeds in the NFC, the Seahawks also had a bye last weekend. By contrast the 49ers -- who have been decimated by a deepening injury crisis for much of the season -- suffered yet another cruel blow against Philadelphia, when tight end George Kittle tore his Achilles tendon.\n\n\"We've kind of been in a hole for about seven months and once you get to the playoffs, it really doesn't matter,\" said 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, of the non-stop schedule.\n\n\"Everyone's into it. So, whether they gave us three days, one day, eight days... whenever you get dealt your hand, you're ready to roll.\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl will be held at the 49ers' home stadium, in Santa Clara, California, on February 8.\n\nIn Sunday's remaining divisional round games, the New England Patriots will host the Houston Texans, and the Los Angeles Rams travel to the Chicago Bears.",

    "fullText": "Serena Williams teased fans with an unlikely return to tennis late last year, with her name having appeared on a drug testing pool.\n\nWilliams immediately shut down the excitement of a potential comeback, with her decision to retire seemingly not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe American legend called time on her glittering career in 2022, leaving tennis with 23 Grand Slam titles to her name.\n\nAnd just a few weeks later, her fellow legend Roger Federer made the same decision, retiring with 20 Grand Slam titles.\n\nFederer is now in Melbourne for the Australian Open, where he was asked about Williams potentially making a return.\n\nHe said of his fellow 44-year-old: “I heard she entered the doping program. Then I heard she’s not coming back.”\n\nAnd when asked why she would put her name down if she wasn’t considering a comeback, he said: “Miss those things, you know.\n\n“So much fun to always think about. That’s one of the big things I was happy to retire at the end, not to have that in my mind.\n\n“For the game, it would be incredible. Serena is such a legend to come back. Also the stories as a mom, with Belinda [Bencic]. It resonates with everyone in the room.\n\n“If she decides not to do it, I would maybe give herself an option. It’s great to have options in life, in my opinion. Let’s see what she does and wait for an announcement or not. Then we’ll see.”\n\nIt remains to be seen what decision Williams takes going forward, but most tennis fans would welcome her back onto the court with open arms.\n\nIntriguingly, her sister is back playing at the age of 45, with Venus Williams set to take on the 2026 Australian Open.\n\nThe veteran has received a wildcard for the Grand Slam, and could potentially face Coco Gauff in round two if she wins her opener against Olga Danilovic.\n\nMeanwhile, Federer’s compatriot Bencic will take on Katie Boulter after her impressive displays at the United Cup earned her the MVP award.\n\nHer 5-0 singles record has also helped her become the first mother since Serena Williams in 2021 to break the WTA top 10.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid are hoping to return to winning ways on Saturday when they host Levante, but they will be without the services of star striker Kylian Mbappe for the La Liga clash at the Bernabeu.\n\nIt has been a difficult week for Real Madrid, who lost to Barcelona in the Spanish Supercup final before being dumped out of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday by Segunda side Albacete. In this period, Xabi Alonso also left his position as head coach, which has been filled by Alvaro Arbeloa.\n\nArbeloa will take charge of his first home match as Real Madrid manager, but as was the case for his debut against Albacete, he will be without Mbappe. As per Marca, the French forward will not be risked at the Bernabeu, given that he is still struggling with discomfort from the knee injury he sustained pre-winter break.\n\nMbappe trained during Thursday’s session and did not appear to have any issues, but internally, it has been decided that he will not be involved against Levante. He played through the pain barrier during last weekend’s Superclasico defeat, but there is a desire for no more risks to be taken with his recovery.\n\nMbappe’s absence will almost certainly mean that Gonzalo Garcia will continue as the starting striker. The 21-year-old has been impressive in the Frenchman’s absence, with five goals in his last four appearances – which includes a hattrick against Real Betis, one in El Clasico, and one in the Copa del Rey defeat to Albacete.\n\nGonzalo will fancy his chances to continue his good form against Levante. Real Madrid need to get back to winning ways as soon as possible, although it won’t be easy against an opponent that is unbeaten in their last three matches.",

That’s pressure on the next head coach to produce instant results.\"\n\nMore:How Ravens' Derrick Henry proved he's one of NFL's best RBs in 2025\n\nI think so, and it isn't unfair to warrant it, either.\n\nWith Lamar, Henry, Hamilton, Mark Andrews, Zay Flowers, and others, there are key pieces to build around. But the biggest thing for the Ravens is getting healthy.\n\nJackson needs to play all 17 games.

    "fullText": "Ohio quarterback Parker Navarro has entered the NCAA Transfer Portal, On3’s Pete Nakos has learned. He’s spent the past four seasons with the Bobcats.\n\nNavarro played high school football at Desert Vista (Phoenix, AZ), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 1308 overall recruit in the 2020 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted algorithm that complies all major recruiting media services. He originally committed to UCF.\n\nOver the course of his collegiate career, Navarro has passed for 5,030 yards and 30 touchdowns, while rushing for 30 touchdowns, as well. He’ll be looking to step up to a bigger stage and make an impact in 2026.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCAA Division I Administrative Committee passed dates for the one-time-only college football transfer portal back earlier in October. As it stands, the 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days. It’ll span Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA announced.\n\nMoving forward, the entire Division I football notification of transfer windows is slated for Jan 2-16. As has been the previous standard, athletes on College Football Playoff teams still playing would have 5 days beginning the day after their team’s final game to enter the transfer portal.\n\nAdditionally, players have 15 days to enter the portal, but they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the deadline for committing is how late a school can enroll a player through admissions.\n\nOne caveat is that if a head coach is fired, the transfer portal will not open for players immediately. The NCAA revealed that moving forward, players will only have 15 days to enter the portal after a coaching change, instead of the former allocation of 30 days. Players will also have to wait five days after a new coach is hired or announced.\n\nFinally, graduate transfers also cannot enter the transfer portal until Jan. 2 with the new one-time-only portal window. All these new guidelines are bound to shake things up, but the transfer portal will still remain as interesting and entertaining as ever.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBen Sherman is heading back to the Olympic stage.\n\nAccording to Flaunt, the British heritage label has been confirmed as the Official Ceremony Wear Supplier for Team GB at the upcoming Milano Cortina 2026, marking the fourth straight Games in which the brand has outfitted the delegation for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies.\n\nMORE: Savannah James melts Lebron's heart with stunning new look\n\nFor this Winter Games cycle, Ben Sherman leaned into cold-weather functionality while keeping its tailoring roots intact. The ceremonial wardrobes are designed to balance warmth, movement, and visual identity—key requirements for athletes stepping into the spotlight during two of the most-watched moments of the Games.\n\nA major element of the collection comes from the brand’s collaboration with five-time Olympic medalist and Paris 2024 flagbearer Tom Daley. Daley helped design the hand-knit scarves and winter hats worn by Team GB athletes carrying the Union Flag. The accessories feature bold GB lettering and textured cable-knit patterns inspired by the snowy landscape surrounding northern Italy.\n\n“Having had the honour of serving as a Flagbearer for Team GB during my last Olympic Games, I understand how powerful that moment is,” Daley said. “It’s more than carrying a flag; it’s carrying the stories, hopes, and identity of everyone who made that journey with you.”\n\nThe Opening Ceremony look centers on a wool dogtooth topcoat with a chequered lining, layered over a mock-neck sweater woven with raised stripes and a repeating Union Flag motif. Tailored sweat joggers with tonal detailing and winter boots with Vibram soles complete the ensemble, offering a clean mix of tradition and performance-ready design.\n\nFor the Closing Ceremony, the silhouettes soften. Athletes will wear a chunky wool-blend knitted track jacket featuring Team GB’s zig-zag illustration, paired with a navy and ecru merino roll-neck for warmth without bulk.\n\nBen Sherman’s campaign spotlighting the collection features British ice dancers Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson, whose movement-driven visuals echo the rhythm and unity of the team itself.\n\nMORE: Karrueche Tran shows off cute bob amid Deion Sanders romance\n\nBehind the scenes, global brand owner Marquee Brands sees the partnership as a natural fit.

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans head coaching search continues, so we ranked the remaining candidates and grouped them into tiers.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are still searching for their next head coach, and with the news that John Harbaugh was hired by the New York Giants, his meeting with the Titans was cancelled. Harbaugh would have been a solid hire, if the Titans had landed him, but they never got a shot.\n\nHe wasn't the only candidate the Titans had, though. They've already completed seven interviews and have more scheduled in the coming weeks. Let's take a look at the remaining candidates the Titans will consider, ranked in tiers.\n\nJason Garrett, NBC personality: While he has head coaching experience with the Dallas Cowboys, Garrett hasn't coached since he was fired by the New York Giants in 2021. He was 85-67 during his 10 years as head coach, but 2-3 in the playoffs.\n\nSteve Spagnuolo, DC, Chiefs: Spags has spent most of his coaching career as a defensive coordinator, with a short stint as head coach of the (then) St. Louis Rams. He's been with the Kansas City Chiefs since 2019, helping the Chiefs to three Super Bowl victories and multiple playoff appearances.\n\nRaheem Morris, former HC, Falcons: Morris has been coaching in the NFL since 2002, earning his first head coaching gig with the Tampa By Buccaneers in 2009-2011. His second head coaching role would be with the Falcons from 2024-2025. His record as a head coach is 35-56.\n\nJonathan Gannon, former HC, Cardinals: Gannon was fired by the Cardinals after his third season as head coach. In his only head coaching role, the Cardinals failed to make the playoffs or record a winning season. His overall record is 15-36.\n\nBrian Daboll, former HC, Giants: Daboll spent eight years as an offensive coordinator before landing the head coaching role with the Giants. Over his four years in New York, Daboll's Giants were 20-40-1, and 1-1 in the playoffs. The playoff appearance was his first season with the team, but they could not find success again.\n\nLou Anarumo, DC, Colts: While Anarumo does not have head coaching experience, he has quickly risen up the ranks in the NFL coaching world. He joined the Dolphins in 2012 as their defensive backs coach and was a defensive coordinator by 2019. In 2025, he was instrumental in the team's 8-2 start before the Colts lost their last seven games.\n\nKliff Kingsbury, former OC, Commanders: After 10 years as a college coach, Kingsbury was hired by the Arizona Cardinals as head coach. In his four years there, the Cardinals were 28-37 and 0-1 in the playoffs. He returned to the college scene in 2023 before joining the Washington Commanders as offensive coordinator in 2024. The two sides mutually parted following the Commanders' five-win season in 2025.\n\nJeff Hafley, DC, Packers: Another coach who has spent more time at the collegiate level than the professional level, Hafley's defense ranked 10th in the NFL in passing this season. The run defense was mediocre, especially after Micah Parsons was injured. He has not been a head coach at the professional level.\n\nMatt Nagy, OC, Chiefs: Nagy already has ties to Tennessee through Mike Borgonzi, as the two worked together in Kansas City for a number of years. He also has previous head coaching experience with the Chicago Bears, where he was 34-31 but couldn't get past the Wild Card round of the playoffs.\n\nChris Shula, DC, Rams: Shula's name alone carries weight as he comes from a family of storied coaches, including his grandfather, Don Shula. He's worked his way up the ranks in the Los Angeles Rams' organization as a defensive guy, and while he's not held a head coaching position, coming from the Sean McVay coaching tree certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nJesse Minter, DC, Chargers: Minter has not held a head coaching role in his career. He had a brief stint with the Baltimore Ravens in various defensive roles, but most of his experience is collegiate. He joined the Los Angeles Chargers in 2024, following Jim Harbaugh from Michigan, where the two worked together since 2019.\n\nVance Joseph, DC, Broncos: Joseph is a defensive guy who had a two-year stint as head coach of the Denver Broncos. The Broncos were 5-11 and 6-10 in his first two seasons, leading to his firing. However, his current defense was one of the top in the NFL in 2025, which is partly why the Broncos are still in the playoffs.\n\nRobert Saleh, DC, 49ers: Saleh's one stint as a head coach was with the New York Jets, and we won't hold that against him. He was 20-36 as head coach of the Jets, but the Jets haven't been relevant since Rex Ryan left, so there's a bit of a caveat there. His 49ers defense is still in the playoffs in 2025, so he's doing something right.\n\nMike McDaniel, former HC, Dolphins: One of the few offensive-minded coaches in the running, McDaniel was 35-33 and 0-2 in the playoffs as head coach of the Miami Dolphins, but his experience in developing Tua Tagovailoa will be instrumental in the development of Cam Ward. He remains a top contender in Tennessee.\n\nMike McCarthy, former HC, Cowboys: McCarthy is a veteran head coach with 18 years of head coaching experience. He spent 13 years with the Green Bay Packers, where they made nine playoff appearances and won a Super Bowl, and five years with the Dallas Cowboys. His overall record is 174-112-2. He only had five losing seasons and one season at .500, while the rest show a winning record.\n\nKevin Stefanski, former HC, Browns: Stefanski's head coaching record is 45-56 and 1-2 in the playoffs. But he took the Cleveland Browns to the playoffs after a 17-year absence. He was saddled with a ridiculous quarterback situation, among other things, so we'll put him in the same category as Saleh and not hold that against him.

    "description": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif.",
    "fullText": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — Another season, another gut punch. The Los Angeles Chargers walked off the field after yet another playoff loss, and once again the uncomfortable truth is staring the organization — and its fan base — directly in the face: Justin Herbert is now 0–3 in the postseason.\n\nAt some point, the excuses have to stop.\n\nFor years, Herbert has been sold as the answer. The golden-armed franchise quarterback. The future Hall of Famer. The one who would finally erase six decades of Chargers heartbreak. But three playoff games is no longer “too small a sample size.” It’s a pattern — and it’s an ugly one.\n\n#Chargers GM Joe Horitz discussed whether he set Justin Herbert up to succeed.\n\n“At times we did, at times we didn’t,” Hortiz said. “Until we win a Super Bowl, I’ll tell you we weren’t good enough.”@SportingTrib | #BoltUp pic.twitter.com/zAHwaKg4Mi\n\n— Fredo Cervantes (@FredoCervantes) January 15, 2026\n\nThis latest Wild Card loss was supposed to be different. New leadership. A championship pedigree head coach. A staff that, by all accounts, did enough to put Herbert in position to win. Yet when the lights were brightest, Herbert was nowhere to be found. No urgency. No takeover moment. No signature drive. Just another quiet exit.\n\nAnd no, this one doesn’t fall on Greg Roman.\n\nRoman paid the price with his job, but firing him feels more like organizational therapy than accountability. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh called it a “fresh start” and a “results-oriented” decision. Fair enough. But if we’re truly being results-oriented, then the conversation can’t keep stopping everywhere except the quarterback.\n\nChargers GM Joe Hortiz was refreshingly honest when asked whether the team put Herbert in position to succeed.\n\n“At times we did, at times we didn’t,” Hortiz said. “Until we win a Super Bowl, I’ll tell you we weren’t good enough.”\n\nThat’s the most truthful statement made by anyone in the building — and it applies directly to Herbert.\n\nHarbaugh, predictably, defended his quarterback.\n\nWinners show up when it matters. Winners elevate in January. Winners don’t shrink in three straight playoff appearances. Herbert hasn’t just lost — he has underperformed relative to his own elite regular-season standard. And that’s the part Chargers fans are tired of ignoring.\n\nThis franchise hasn’t won a Super Bowl in over 60 years. Sixty. That’s generations of loyal fans investing emotionally, financially, and spiritually into a team that continually finds new ways to fall short. The Chargers don’t need pretty throws in September. They need wins in January.\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nLos Angeles Chargers quarterback, Justin Herbert (10) passing during an NFL football game against the Las Vegas Raiders on November 30, 2025 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nRight now, Herbert looks like the ultimate regular-season quarterback — capable of piling up yards, highlight throws, and analytics love — but not capable of carrying a team when the pressure peaks. That’s not a Hall of Fame résumé. That’s a cautionary one.\n\nThe organization seems to understand something has to change, which brings us to the offensive coordinator search. Herbert, notably, will have no say in it.\n\n“I have no questions about his ability as a player,” Harbaugh said. “He’s not looking to be the GM or the coach. It’s our responsibility to put him in the best position possible.”\n\nThat’s fine. Quarterbacks don’t need personnel power. But at some point, “putting him in position” has to stop being the shield. The coaching staff did enough. The roster did enough. Herbert didn’t.\n\nSo now the Chargers search for another “fix.” Marcus Brady has already interviewed. More candidates are coming. The net, as Harbaugh said, is wide. They want someone with a track record, vision, and proven success. They want a physical run game. A tough, smart offense. A “head coach of the offense.”\n\nAnd maybe they’ll find the right system. But systems don’t throw the ball. Quarterbacks do.\n\nIf Herbert truly is the quarterback Harbaugh believes he is, then it shouldn’t matter who the coordinator is when the season is on the line. Great quarterbacks overcome. Elite quarterbacks elevate. Championship quarterbacks don’t need everything perfect to deliver one playoff win.\n\nHerbert still hasn’t delivered one.\n\nThe Chargers will keep building. They’ll keep changing coordinators. They’ll keep promising progress. But unless Herbert proves he can be more than a regular-season star, the ending will remain the same.\n\nAnother January loss. Another fresh start. Another year further away from the championship Chargers fans have waited six decades to see.",

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Pete Nakos, Jordan Seaton is currently in Starkville to visit Mississippi State. Seaton is close with the Bulldogs’ offensive line coach, Phil Loadholt, from their time at Colorado. A huge development for head coach Jeff Lebby, hoping to get in the running for one of the best players in the NCAA transfer portal.\n\nLoadholt only spent one season in Boulder. Colorado hired him away from Oklahoma, where he was an offensive analyst on Brent Venables’ initial staff. Lebby was the offensive coordinator at the time, making the connection between the two. So when Lebby needed an OL coach at Mississippi State, Loadholt wound up being his guy.\n\nNow, the coaching duo is hoping the connection can pay dividends. The competition for Seaton is going to be a tough one. Nakos recently provided the latest on where things stand for the offensive tackle. Friday will bring another SEC trip for him, heading to the 40 Acres to see the Texas Longhorns.\n\nThe On3 Industry Transfer Portal Rankings have Seaton as a four-star prospect and No. 4 overall player to enter this cycle. No offensive tackle ranks above him, showing how highly thought of he is. Seaton is also the No. 1 player currently available in the portal.\n\nColorado got Seaton on campus ahead of the 2024 season, being a massive recruiting win for head coach Deion Sanders. He immediately slotted into the left tackle role, initially protecting quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Some positives came from Seaton’s true freshman campaign before really exploding in 2025. Quality performances earned him second-team All-Big 12.\n\nSeaton played high school football at Bradenton (FL) IMG Academy, where he was a Five-Star Plus+ prospect. He was the No. 18 overall recruit in the 2024 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.",

    "title": "My Gripes with Prolog",
    "description": "It's not my favorite language",
    "fullText": "For the next release of Logic for Programmers, I'm finally adding the sections on Answer Set Programming and Logic Constraint Programming that I TODOd back in version 0.9. And this is making me re-experience some of my pain points with Prolog, which I will gripe about now. If you want to know more about why Prolog is cool instead, go here or here or here or here.\n\nISO \"strings\" are just atoms or lists of single-character atoms (or lists of integer character codes). The various implementations of Prolog add custom string operators but they are not cross compatible, so code written with strings in SWI-Prolog will not work in Scryer Prolog.\n\nCode logic is expressed entirely in rules, predicates which return true or false for certain values. For example if you wanted to get the length of a Prolog list, you write this:\n\nNow this is pretty cool in that it allows bidirectionality, or running predicates \"in reverse\". To generate lists of length 3, you can write length(L, 3). But it also means that if you want to get the length a list plus one, you can't do that in one expression, you have to write length(List, Out), X is Out+1.\n\nFor a while I thought no functions was necessary evil for bidirectionality, but then I discovered Picat has functions and works just fine. That by itself is a reason for me to prefer Picat for my LP needs.\n\n(Bidirectionality is a killer feature of Prolog, so it's a shame I so rarely run into situations that use it.)\n\nAside from atoms (abc) and numbers, there are two data types:\n\nThere's no proper key-value maps or even struct types. Again, this is something that individual distributions can fix (without cross compatibility), but these never feel integrated with the rest of the language.\n\ntrue and false aren't values, they're control flow statements. true is a noop and false says that the current search path is a dead end, so backtrack and start again. You can't explicitly store true and false as values, you have to implicitly have them in facts (passed(test) instead of test.passed? == true).\n\nThis hasn't made any tasks impossible, and I can usually find a workaround to whatever I want to do. But I do think it makes things more inconvenient! Sometimes I want to do something dumb like \"get all atoms that don't pass at least three of these rules\", and that'd be a lot easier if I could shove intermediate results into a sack of booleans.\n\n(This is called \"Negation as Failure\". I think this might be necessary to make Prolog a Turing complete general programming language. Picat fixes a lot of Prolog's gripes and still has negation as failure. ASP has regular negation but it's not Turing complete.)\n\nProlog finds solutions through depth first search, and a \"cut\" (!) symbol prevents backtracking past a certain point. This is necessary for optimization but can lead to invalid programs.\n\nYou're not supposed to use cuts if you can avoid it, so I pretended cuts didn't exist. Which is why I was surprised to find that conditionals are implemented with cuts. Because cuts are spooky dark magic conditionals sometimes conditionals work as I expect them to and sometimes leave out valid solutions and I have no idea how to tell which it'll be. Usually I find it safer to just avoid conditionals entirely, which means my code gets a lot longer and messier.\n\nThe original example in the last section was this:\n\nfoo(1, 2) returns true, so you'd expect f(A, B) to return A=1, B=2. But it returns false. Whereas this works as expected.\n\nI thought this was because \\+ was implemented with cuts, and the Clocksin book suggests it's call(P), !, fail, so this was my prime example about how cuts are confusing. But then I tried this:\n\nThere's no way to get that behavior with cuts! I don't think \\+ uses cuts at all! And now I have to figure out why \nfoo(A, B) doesn't returns results. Is it floundering? Is it because \\+ P only succeeds if P fails, and A = B always succeeds? A closed-world assumption? Something else?1\n\nSay I have a program like this:\n\nAnd I want to know all of the nodes that are parents of branches. The normal way to do this is with a query:\n\nThis is interactively making me query for every result. That's usually not what I want, I know the result of my query is finite and I want all of the results at once, so I can count or farble or whatever them. It took a while to figure out that the proper solution is bagof(Template, Goal, Bag), which will \"Unify Bag with the alternatives of Template\":\n\nWait crap that's still giving one result at a time, because N is a free variable in bagof so it backtracks over that. It surprises me but I guess it's good to have as an option. So how do I get all of the results at once?\n\nThe only difference is the N^Goal, which tells bagof to ignore and group the results of N. As far as I can tell, this is the only place the ISO standard uses ^ to mean anything besides exponentiation. Supposedly it's the existential quantifier? In general whenever I try to stray outside simpler use-cases, especially if I try to do things non-interactively, I run into trouble.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize the reason bagof \"works\" is because infix symbols are mapped to prefix compound terms, so that a^b is ^(a, b), and then different predicates can decide to do different things with ^(a, b).\n\nThis is also why you can't just write A = B+1: that unifies A with the compound term +(B, 1). A+1 = B+2 is false, as 1 \\= 2. You have to write A+1 is B+2, as is is the operator that converts +(B, 1) to a mathematical term.\n\n(And that fails because is isn't fully bidirectional. The lhs must be a single variable. You have to import clpfd and write A + 1 #= B + 2.)\n\nI don't like this, but I'm a hypocrite for saying that because I appreciate the idea and don't mind custom symbols in other languages. I guess what annoys me is there's no official definition of what ^(a, b) is, it's purely a convention. ISO Prolog uses -(a, b) (aka a-b) as a convention to mean \"pairs\", and the only way to realize that is to see that an awful lot of standard modules use that convention. But you can use -(a, b) to mean something else in your own code and nothing will warn you of the inconsistency.\n\nAnyway I griped about pairs so I can gripe about sort.\n\nAccording to an expert online this is because sort is supposed to return a sorted set, not a sorted list. If you want to preserve duplicates you're supposed to lift all of the values into -($key, $value) compound terms, then use keysort, then extract the values. And, since there's no functions, this process takes at least three lines. This is also how you're supposed to sort by a custom predicate, like \"the second value of a compound term\".\n\n(Most (but not all) distributions have a duplicate merge like msort. SWI-Prolog also has a sort by key but it removes duplicates.)\n\nI don't care if it makes fact parsing ambiguous, I just don't want \"reorder two lines\" to be a syntax error anymore\n\nI expect by this time tomorrow I'll have been Cunningham'd and there will be a 2000 word essay about how all of my gripes are either easily fixable by doing XYZ or how they are the best possible choice that Prolog could have made. I mean, even in writing this I found out some fixes to problems I had. Like I was going to gripe about how I can't run SWI-Prolog queries from the command line but, in doing do diligence finally finally figured it out:\n\nIt's pretty clunky but still better than the old process of having to enter an interactive session every time I wanted to validate a script change.\n\n(Also, answer set programming is pretty darn cool. Excited to write about it in the book!)\n\nA couple of people mentioned using dif/2 instead of \\+ A = B. Dif is great but usually I hit the negation footgun with things like \\+ foo(A, B), bar(B, C), baz(A, C), where dif/2 isn't applicable. ↩",

    "description": "Explore the inevitable shift from scripts to AI agents in coding. Discover insights on automation, tool access, and setting effective guardrails.",
    "fullText": "I’ve noticed a pattern in my coding life. It starts innocently enough. I sit down to write a simple Python script, maybe something to tidy up my Obsidian vault or a quick CLI tool to query an API. “Keep it simple,” I tell myself. “Just input, processing, output.”\n\nBut then, the inevitable thought creeps in: It would be cool if the model could decide which file to read based on the user’s question.\n\nTwo hours later, I’m not writing a script anymore. I’m writing a while loop. I’m defining a tools array. I’m parsing JSON outputs and handing them back to the model. I’m building memory context windows.\n\n(For those keeping track: my working definition of an “agent” is simple: a model running in a loop with access to tools. I explored this in depth in my Agentic Shift series, but that’s the core of it.)\n\nAs I sit here writing this in January of 2026, I realize that almost every AI project I worked on last year ultimately became an agent. It feels like a law of nature: Every AI project, given enough time, converges on becoming an agent. In this post, I want to share some of what I’ve learned, and the cases where you might skip the intermediate steps and jump straight to building an agent.\n\nThis isn’t just feature creep. It’s a fundamental shift in how we interact with software. We are moving past the era of “smart typewriters” and into the era of “digital interns.”\n\nTake Gemini Scribe, my plugin for Obsidian. When I started, it was a glorified chat window. You typed a prompt, it gave you text. Simple. But as I used it, the friction became obvious. If I wanted Scribe to use another note as context for a task, I had to take a specific action, usually creating a link to that note from the one I was working on, to make sure it was considered. I was managing the model’s context manually.\n\nI was the “glue” code. I was the context manager.\n\nThe moment I gave Scribe access to the read_file tool, the dynamic changed. Suddenly, I wasn’t micromanaging context; I was giving instructions. “Read the last three meeting notes and draft a summary.” That’s not a chat interaction; that’s a delegation. And to support delegation, the software had to become an agent, capable of planning, executing, and iterating.\n\nThe Gemini CLI followed a similar arc. There were many of us on the team experimenting with Gemini on the command line. I was working on iterative refinement, where the model would ask clarifying questions to create deeper artifacts. Others were building the first agentic loops, giving the model the ability to run shell commands.\n\nOnce we saw how much the model could do with even basic tools, we were hooked. Suddenly, it wasn’t just talking about code; it was writing and executing it. It could run tests, see the failure, edit the file, and run the tests again. It was eye-opening how much we could get done as a small team.\n\nBut with great power comes great anxiety. As I explored in my Agentic Shift post on building guardrails and later in my post about the Policy Engine, I found myself staring at a blinking cursor, terrified that my helpful assistant might accidentally rm -rf my project.\n\nThis is the hallmark of the agentic shift: you stop worrying about syntax errors and start worrying about judgment errors. We had to build a “sudoers” file for our AI, a permission system that distinguishes between “read-only exploration” and “destructive action.” You don’t build policy engines for scripts; you build them for agents.\n\nLast year, I learned to recognize a specific code smell: the AI classifier.\n\nIn my Podcast RAG project, I wanted users to search across both podcast descriptions and episode transcripts. Different databases, different queries. So I did what felt natural: I built a small classifier using Gemini Flash Lite. It would analyze the user’s question and decide: “Is this a description search or a transcript search?” Then it would call the appropriate function.\n\nIt worked. But something nagged at me. I had written a classifier to make a decision that a model is already good at making. Worse, the classifier was brittle. What if the user wanted both? What if their intent was ambiguous? I was encoding my assumptions about user behavior into branching logic, and those assumptions were going to be wrong eventually.\n\nThe fix was almost embarrassingly simple. I deleted the classifier and gave the agent two tools: search_descriptions and search_episodes. Now, when a user asks a question, the agent decides which tool (or tools) to use. It can search descriptions first, realize it needs more detail, and then dive into transcripts. It can do both in parallel. It makes the call in context, not based on my pre-programmed heuristics. (You can try it yourself at podcasts.hutchison.org.)\n\nI saw the same pattern in Gemini Scribe. Early versions had elaborate logic for context harvesting, code that tried to predict which notes the user would need based on their current document and conversation history. I was building a decision tree for context, and it was getting unwieldy.\n\nWhen I moved Scribe to a proper agentic architecture, most of that logic evaporated. The agent didn’t need me to pre-fetch context; it could use a read_file tool to grab what it needed, when it needed it. The complex anticipation logic was replaced by simple, reactive tool calls. The application got simpler and more capable at the same time.\n\nHere’s the heuristic I’ve landed on: If you’re writing if/else logic to decide what the AI should do, you might be building a classifier that wants to be an agent. Deconstruct those branches into tools, give the agent really good descriptions of what those tools can do, and then let the model choose its own adventure.\n\nYou might be thinking: “What about routing queries to different models? Surely a classifier makes sense there.” I’m not so sure anymore. Even model routing starts to look like an orchestration problem, and a lightweight orchestrator with tools for accessing different models gives you the same flexibility without the brittleness. The question isn’t whether an agent can make the decision better than your code. It’s whether the agent, with access to the actual data in the moment, can make a decision at least as good as what you’re trying to predict when you’re writing the code. The agent has context you don’t have at development time.\n\nWe are transitioning from Human-in-the-Loop (where we manually approve every step) to Human-on-the-Loop (where we set the goals and guardrails, but let the system drive).\n\nThis shift is driven by a simple desire: we want partners, not just tools. As I wrote back in April about waiting for a true AI coding partner, a tool requires your constant attention. A hammer does nothing unless you swing it. But an agent? An agent can work while you sleep.\n\nThis freedom comes with a new responsibility: clarity. If your agent is going to work overnight, you need to make sure it’s working on something productive. You need to be precise about the goal, explicit about the boundaries, and thoughtful about what happens when things go wrong. Without the right guardrails, an agent can get stuck waiting for your input, and you’ll lose that time. Or worse, it can get sidetracked and spend hours on something that wasn’t what you intended.\n\nThe goal isn’t to remove the human entirely. It’s to move us from the execution layer to the supervision layer. We set the destination and the boundaries; the agent figures out the route. But we have to set those boundaries well.\n\nHere’s the counterintuitive thing: building an agent isn’t always harder than building a script. Yes, you have to think about loops, tool definitions, and context window management. But as my classifier example showed, an agentic architecture can actually delete complexity. All that brittle branching logic, all those edge cases I was trying to anticipate: gone. Replaced by a model that can reason about what it needs in the moment.\n\nThe real complexity isn’t in the code; it’s in the trust. You have to get comfortable with a system that makes decisions you didn’t explicitly program. That’s a different kind of engineering challenge, less about syntax, more about guardrails and judgment.\n\nBut the payoff is a system that grows with you. A script does exactly what you wrote it to do, forever. An agent does what you ask it to do, and sometimes finds better ways to do it than you’d considered.\n\nSo, if you find yourself staring at your “simple script” and wondering if you should give it a tools definition… just give in. You’re building an agent. It’s inevitable. You might as well enjoy the company.",

    "fullText": "As a viral app sparks debate about solo living in China, new Census Bureau data shows that the share of one-person households in the US is reaching record highs.\n\nA new app has risen to the top of China’s iPhone App Store charts — one markedly more macabre than the messaging platforms and AI assistants that typically lead the ranking.\n\nOn Monday, media outlets reported that the viral app Sile Me (which roughly translates from Mandarin as a very literal “Are You Dead?”) had become the country’s most popular paid Apple App Store download.\n\nLaunched in mid-2025 and costing a mere 8 yuan ($1.15) to buy, Sile Me offers just one function: a large button that users can press to confirm that they are, in fact, alive. If they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app will reach out to an appointed emergency contact.\n\nWhile the app’s simplicity is reminiscent of some earlier patrons of the App Store, its sudden popularity is putting the spotlight on the growing cohort of solo dwellers in the Eastern nation.\n\nResearch suggests that there could be as many as 200 million one-person households in China by 2030 — and while a rapidly aging population explains some of that rise, younger people now also appear to be embracing living alone.\n\nIn America, it’s no different. Data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey for 2025 reveals that the number of one-person households in the US is edging close to a record 40 million, with the share of American households made up of just one person hitting an all-time high of 29%.\n\nThis includes an estimated ~1.3 million extra one-person households in 2025 compared with the prior year, though the Bureau noted that this may be reflective of both demographic changes and methodological updates. Even so, the significant rise over the last decade indicates a broader societal shift that’s been playing out around the globe.\n\nAs noted by The Economist in November, the share of people living alone has increased in 26 out of 30 rich countries since 2010.\n\nMarriage rates are continuing to plummet in the US, as well as in China and many other developed nations, which has coincided with rising incomes and some heated online discourse about traditional relationships. And, like China, the surge in solo dwellings is also being driven at the older end of the demographic spectrum: America’s population aged 65 and older, statistically the most likely cohort to live alone, is expected to keep booming.",

    "description": "When analyzing early universe data, the Standard Model of Cosmology suggests that the universe should be more “clumpy” that what we observe.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nWhen analyzing early universe data, the Standard Model of Cosmology suggests that the universe should be more “clumpy” that what we observe.\n\nA new study suggests that interactions between the two most elusive particle types in the universe—dark matter and neutrinos—could help explain this discrepancy.\n\nThe study analyzes cosmic shear data from both the early and late universe, and theorizes that such interactions have a strength of about 10-4.\n\nTwo of the most enigmatic particles in the known universe are dark matter (theorized to make up most of the matter in the cosmos) and neutrinos (weakling-interacting, nearly massless subatomic particles that can’t be observed directly). Because these two particles are decidedly anti-social, it makes sense that the ΛCDM model—our current best guess of what makes the universe tick—suggests that they certainly don’t interact with each other. Right?\n\nWell, not so fast. A new study (from scientists at the University of Sheffield, the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Poland, and the University of Science and Technology of China) analyzes cosmic shear data from the early- and late-universe sources, and suggests that interactions between these two particles could explain why the cosmos isn’t as clumpy as we’d expect from early-universe data alone. The results were published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\n“Observations of the modern universe indicate that matter is slightly less clumped than expected, pointing to a mild mismatch between early- and late-time measurements,” Eleonora Di Valentino, a co-author of the study from the University of Sheffield, said in a press statement. “Our study shows that interactions between dark matter and neutrinos could help explain this difference, offering new insight into how structure formed in the universe.”\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, scientists first needed loads of data from both eras of the universe—and luckily, they had a lot to choose from. For the early universe, they relied on observations from the terrestrial Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the space-based Planck Telescope. For observations of more recent times, the team relied on the massive trove of data from the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\n\nWith data in hand, Valentino and her team focused on a phenomenon called cosmic shear, which describes the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing caused by the universe’s structure. According to Universe Today, if neutrinos and dark matter influence each other, this interaction would impact the structure of galactic clusters and voids in a similar manner to what we observe today. By the team’s observations, dark matter and neutrinos react with a strength of about 10-4.\n\nWhile a compelling piece of evidence, the scientists note that the statistical significance of this finding rests at three sigma (3σ), which is not enough to be considered definitive proof (that typically requires a statistical significance of 5σ). Valentino also clarifies that this discovery doesn’t necessarily upend the ΛCDM model, but may indicate that it is complete.\n\nHopefully, future cosmic microwave background experiments, more precise weak lensing surveys, and ever more accurate data from new telescopes could further confirm (or deny) this big “woah, if true” moment.\n\n“It would not only shed new light on a persistent mismatch between different cosmological probes, but also provide particle physicists with a concrete direction,” William Giarè, a co-author of the study from the University of Sheffield, said in a press statement, “indicating which properties to look for in laboratory experiments to help finally unmask the true nature of dark matter.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

T. rex wouldn’t have reached its maximum size of around 8 tons until it was 35 to 40 years old, the analysis found.\n\nUnlike tree growth rings, dinosaur growth rings only capture the final 10 to 20 years of an individual’s life.\n\nBut because the specimens ranged in age from early juveniles to adults, researchers were able to put together a picture of their growth using a new statistical approach that combines records from individuals of different ages.\n\nDrawing on the largest dataset ever put together for Tyrannosaurus rex, researchers were able to reconstruct their growth history year by year and found that the dinosaurs grew much more slowly than previously thought.\n\n“Instead of growing quickly, T. rex spent most of its life in the mid-body size range rather than achieving a total body length of 40 feet quickly,” lead study author Holly Woodward, a professor of anatomy at Oklahoma State University, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“Additionally, we found that growth ring spacing varied within individuals, with some years showing substantial growth and others very little,” she said. “This variability suggests that growth was flexible and likely influenced by resource availability and possibly environmental conditions.”\n\nThe findings help scientists understand more about the king of the dinosaurs and its role in the world tens of millions of years ago, Woodward said.\n\n“I think the study helps reveal why T. rex was so successful as an apex carnivore — that by growing slowly over a longer period of time, T. rex occupied many food niches throughout its life, eventually becoming large enough that it was only really competing with other T. rex for resources,” she said.\n\nIn addition, differences in the growth curves of some of the specimens involved in the study add to the scientific debate as to whether what paleontologists believed to be a single species named Tyrannosaurus rex is in fact a complex that includes other species or subspecies.\n\nFor example, a study published in October uncovered evidence that a specimen thought to have belonged to a teenage T. rex was actually from a different species known as Nanotyrannus.\n\nWhile the growth rates examined in this study cannot definitively prove the existence of separate species, “the evidence suggests that intriguing possibility, among other possible explanations,” according to the researchers’ statement.\n\nThe new study’s findings mesh well with the recent work on Nanotyrannus, said Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at Scotland’s University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“This is good, provocative work that also suggests that there was more variation among T. rex than we used to think, and that some fossils that have long been called T. rex may actually belong to different species,” Brusatte said.\n\nThe discovery of a new type of dinosaur growth ring could also have wider implications for paleontologists investigating dinosaur growth rates.\n\n“Interpreting multiple closely spaced growth marks is tricky,” said study coauthor Nathan Myhrvold, a mathematician and paleobiologist at invention and investment business Intellectual Ventures, in the statement.\n\n“We found strong evidence that the protocols typically used in growth studies may need to be revised,” he said.\n\n Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.",

    "description": "Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979",
    "fullText": "PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979 Islamic Revolution still afflicts the leading opposition factions.\n\nThat split, between monarchists supporting Reza Pahlavi, son of the ousted shah, and a more organised leftist group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq, has played out online ​and even in angry arguments in street protests in Europe and North America.\n\nHow far either faction has support inside Iran, or might be able to shape events there in the future, is hard to gauge, ‌though analysts and diplomats have for decades regarded both as being far more popular among emigres than inside the country.\n\nMany other Iranians outside Iran are also deeply sceptical of both the monarchists and MEK, but have no organised opposition network comparable to those factions.\n\nThe lack of a universally ‌accepted opposition movement or figurehead has complicated international approaches towards the deadly unrest sweeping Iran, with U.S. President Donald Trump questioning Pahlavi's support even as he weighed air strikes.\n\n\"What's problematic is there has been no inclusive organisation that has been built that can bring together Iranians of all walks of life: religious, ethnic, socioeconomic,\" said Sanam Vakil, Middle East head at the Chatham House think tank in London.\n\nDuring the past two weeks of violent unrest, videos in Iranian cities have shown some demonstrators chanting in support of the ousted monarchy and the late shah's son, who has encouraged the protests.\n\nShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled into exile in 1979 and died a year later, was a close Western ally who harked back to ⁠ancient Persian heritage in framing his rule as a national leader and moderniser. But ‌he resisted democratic change as increasing economic disparities destabilised the country.\n\nHis 65-year-old son, who is based in the U.S., says he wants democracy for Iran and has not specified any role he would seek if the current system collapsed. His supporters run one of the main Persian-language satellite television stations broadcasting into Iran.\n\nReza Pahlavi's supporters in the West have pointed to ‍the videos of protesters in Iran chanting his name as evidence his popularity is growing, saying he is the only figure able to unite the country if the Islamic Republic implodes.\n\nAmong foreign officials and diplomats following Iran there are mixed views as to whether the latest protests show that Pahlavi's role is growing.\n\nA Western diplomat said Pahlavi's name may have been used by street protesters because there were few other recognisable opposition figures, but that there was no sign he commanded the sort of domestic support that could make ​him a future leader.\n\nA European official said a big spike in protest numbers after a call for street action by foreign opponents of the government, including Pahlavi, showed his stature may be broader than was previously understood.\n\nHowever, ‌any role he played would need to be in the context of a wider democratic movement, said Iranian analyst and former diplomat Mehrdad Khonsari. \"You need a coalition of people who believe in democratic values in order to sort of lighten the weight and give greater confidence to people,\" he said.\n\nThe idea that Pahlavi may have popularity inside Iran is not shared by the MEK, whose supporters regard the pre-revolution monarchy as comparable to the current Shi'ite theocracy.\n\nIts supporters online often use the slogan \"No Monarchy, No Supreme Leader\".\n\nThe MEK is a movement fusing leftist and Islamist ideas whose cadres carried out bombings inside Iran before and after the revolution, even as mass support was growing for rival factions on the streets.\n\nThe ruling clerics banished the MEK in 1981 and it established military bases in Iraq that it used to launch attacks on Iranian troops during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, something many Iranians remember with fury.\n\nIt was listed as a terrorist ⁠organisation in the United States until 2012, but some Western politicians have voiced backing for the group including former U.S. secretary of ​state Mike Pompeo.\n\nHowever, the European official described the MEK as widely despised inside Iran, partly because of its conduct during the Iran-Iraq war, ​and analysts say it has had little presence in the country for decades.\n\nThe group's official leader Massoud Rajavi has not been seen since 2002 and is widely thought to be dead, though the MEK has not acknowledged that. His wife, Maryam Rajavi, runs the organisation and its affiliate, the National Council for Resistance in Iran.\n\nGroup officials say their supporters are widespread in Iran and ‍active, though there has been no public sign of support ⁠for the MEK seen by Reuters during the protests.\n\nMonarchists - along with many other Iranian dissidents and Iran's current rulers - regard the MEK with intense suspicion, pointing to its history of violence and enforcement of ideological purity within its ranks.\n\nFor many Iranians, the arguments between the Islamic Republic's theocratic establishment, monarchists voicing nostalgia for the 1970s, and a revolutionary group that lost out in the early 1980s may seem outdated.\n\nEven as monarchist and ⁠MEK supporters remained prominent among émigrés and as the same faces revolved through the upper echelons of the Islamic Republic, Iran's population was doubling in size and growing more urban and educated.\n\nMost major political movements inside Iran after 1979 sought to either bolster or reform the Islamic ‌Republic, rather than sweep it away entirely, until successive waves of protest in recent years demanding more comprehensive change.\n\n\"Iranians inside Iran are, I think, not just looking to the diaspora for their future,\" ‌said Vakil.",

    "description": "Gen X is heading toward retirement with hidden challenges. Discover three sneaky problems that could derail your plans and how to avoid them.",
    "fullText": "Gen X is inching closer to retirement, but many of the challenges waiting ahead are the same ones baby boomers are struggling with right now.\n\nSome of these issues can disrupt even the most carefully built retirement plan. If you’re part of Gen X, make sure you’re aware of these retirement problems so that you have time to adjust and avoid the financial surprises many Boomers are seeing.\n\nMany Boomers assumed they would downsize, cash out some equity and move into a smaller place during retirement. In reality, a lot of them are stuck in houses that are either too expensive to maintain or too large for their current lifestyle.\n\nThe main reason for this is that home prices have gone up so much that selling your home and buying something smaller may not even be worth the effort. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the median sales price of houses sold for the United States is now around $410,000, $100,000 higher than five years ago. Even condos and townhomes in many cities now cost more than what Boomers paid for their original homes. High mortgage rates are also discouraging people from moving because they do not want to trade a low rate for a higher one in retirement.\n\nGen X could face the same situation. You may have a good amount of home equity on paper, but that doesn’t guarantee you can convert it into a more affordable living arrangement. If your future home budget is based on selling and moving, you may want to create a backup plan that accounts for staying put longer than expected.\n\nBe Aware: 64% of Americans Aren’t Prepared For Retirement — and 48% Don’t Care\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nBoomers have already learned that Social Security is not the reliable base income many assume it is. Even though the program is still paying benefits, current retirees are facing two issues that Gen X should prepare for.\n\nThe first is that Social Security can be smaller than expected. The Social Security Board of Trustees projects program cost to rise by 2035 so that taxes will be enough to pay for only 75% of scheduled benefits. In other words, you should plan for benefits that may replace a lower percentage of pre-retirement income.\n\nThe second issue is taxes. Many retirees are surprised to learn that up to 85% of their Social Security benefits can be taxable depending on their total income, per the Social Security Administration (SSA). These tax thresholds have not been adjusted for inflation in decades, so more people are pushed into higher tax liability without realizing it.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "With over 170 million Americans facing below average temperatures, even colder air may be on the horizon thanks to the displacement of the polar vortex that will lock in a deep winter feel and park the coldest air over North America.\n\nIn the coming weeks, cold air will continue for parts of the U.S. thanks to the influence of the polar vortex.\n\nTypically, a strong polar vortex keeps the coldest air locked up around the North and South poles. When it weakens, it allows for cold air intrusions into the lower latitudes, opening a window for cold air to flow into the U.s., but what we’re facing now is different.\n\nIn this case, the polar vortex has been stretched or elongated rather than significantly weakened. When this happens, the coldest air is not able to consolidate in one region and is instead dispersed across a large area, leading to prolonged cold spells.\n\nIn the current circumstances, the displaced polar vortex will keep the coldest air over North America and bring prolonged periods of cold to the eastern portion of the Lower 48 through the end of January.\n\nLooking ahead, forecast guidance suggests the two lobes of the polar vortex may begin to recombine, strengthening the overall vortex again, acting like a focused reservoir of Arctic air.\n\nIn the event the entire core of the polar vortex shifts away from the pole and toward Canada, it would create a \"direct channel\" for frigid temperatures to flow into the U.S.\n\nThe first of this vortex-influenced cold will initially build across Canada late next week before driving south into the U.S. as we head into the final week of January.\n\nIt remains to be seen just how cold it will get, but the greatest probability of frigid air will be from the northern Rockies, through the northern Plains, Great Lakes and into the Northeast.\n\nSo bundle up, the heart of winter lies ahead, and it looks like this year, it may be especially frigid.\n\nThe stretched displacement of the polar vortex that could produce prolonged cold spells for millions of Americans across the Northern Tier comes as a deep winter chill settles in the East.\n\nAfter a quick January thaw for most across the Lower 48, winter will roar back with temperatures crashing well below average from the Upper Midwest and stretching into Florida this week.\n\nFriday morning may be the coldest of the week, with freezing temperatures reaching as far south as Jacksonville and Daytona Beach. To provide perspective on the intensity of the cold, Tallahassee is forecast to be 26 degrees; meanwhile, Denver—located 1,630 miles away and at an elevation 5,155 feet higher—is forecast to be 27 degrees that same morning.\n\nSnow Could Show In The South As Chances Increase Ahead Of The Weekend\n\nThis first shot of arctic air will plunge over 170 million Americans into below-average temperatures Thuesday. While parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast will feel the chill, the most significant shift will occur across the Southeast; cities like Nashville, Atlanta and Louisville may not even reach 40 degrees for an afternoon high.\n\nOn Saturday, a second shot of bitter cold air will hit the Upper Midwest, where high temperatures may struggle to reach 10 degrees.\n\nThis deep freeze will persist through the weekend and into early next week. To make matters worse, wind chills are expected to plunge to -10 to -20 degrees in Minneapolis and Chicago on Sunday.\n\nNfl Rams Vs.

    "fullText": "Jan 15 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications said on Thursday it is offering a $20 credit to hundreds of thousands of customers impacted by ​its 10-hour outage on Wednesday that the U.S. wireless company said ‌was caused by a software issue.\n\nVerizon said the issue primarily impacted customers in the northeast, southern California, ‌Texas and pockets of the Midwest and was not the result of a cyberattack. The issue was resolved around 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT) Wednesday.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said it would review the outage.\n\n\"We did not meet the standard of excellence our ⁠customers expect and that we ‌expect of ourselves. To help provide some relief to those affected, we are giving customers a $20 account credit,\" Verizon said.\n\nThe company ‍added \"if customers are still experiencing issues, we encourage them to restart their devices to reconnect to the network.\"\n\nThe outage prompted several major cities to advise residents to use other carriers ​to call emergency services. Downdetector, which aggregates data on service outages, said ‌late Wednesday it had received 2.2 million reports over the last 24 hours related to the Verizon service disruption.\n\nFederal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr told Reuters after a congressional hearing that the agency would review the issue \"and take appropriate action\".\n\nNew York City told residents the outage could affect some users trying to call 911 ⁠for emergency help. \"Call using a device from ​another carrier, a landline, or go to a ​police/fire station to report emergencies,\" the city said on X.\n\nThe District of Columbia issued a similar alert. The warnings were dropped after ‍operations resumed normally.\n\nVerizon faced a ⁠nationwide wireless outage in late 2024 that affected more than 100,000 users at its peak. The outage drew the FCC's attention after several services ⁠were affected and iPhone users were stuck in \"SOS\" mode. Many users on Wednesday reported the same ‌issue about phones in \"SOS\" mode.",

A Hamas source said that local commander Mohammed Al-Holy was killed in Deir al-Balah, earlier in the day.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ⁠incident.\n\nHamas condemned the strikes on ‌the Al-Holy family, in a statement that did not mention Mohammed or his role in the group.

The group came together in an effort to address Trump’s pursuit of Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“I would not normally like to say these words, but I will say them: We are very strong,” Motzfeldt said. “We are doing our utmost. But the last days, naturally… Oh, I am getting very emotional. I am overwhelmed.”\n\nShe added: “The last days have been tough. Our preparations and the increasing pressure that has been intense. But I want to say, we are strong in the government. The work is to ensure the the Greenlandic people in our country can feel safe and live securely. We are using all our strength to achieve this as we continue the work.”\n\nOver the past year, Trump hasn’t let up on his desire to take over Greenland. During an interview with press, per Politico, Rasmussen said he and his team hit a roadblock with Trump over the region.\n\n“We didn’t manage to change the American position,” Rasmussen said Wednesday. “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland. We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of the Kingdom.”\n\nThe post Greenland Official Chokes Up After Trump Meeting Over US Acquisition Talk: ‘I Am Overwhelmed’ | Video appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, I moved from Kentucky to Ireland for love. Many people think my life is a dream, but I struggle with challenges like homesickness.",
    "fullText": "Whenever I tell someone back home in Kentucky that my husband is Irish and we live in Ireland, they get this dreamy look in their eyes.\n\nI can imagine what they probably think my life looks like: living in a thatched-roof cottage, strolling among gently rolling hills dotted with fluffy sheep, and spending cozy, firelit evenings in a pub overflowing with laughter and live traditional music.\n\nThose things do exist in Ireland — but, as I found out, not to the extent Hollywood and the tourism industry would have you believe.\n\nI was in my mid-20s when I arrived in Cork City for a dream internship at a local restaurant. I couldn't believe my luck.\n\nLocals and newcomers alike always say that Cork, Ireland's second-largest city, is really just a village. Its community vibe, bustling markets, and diverse cultural activities quickly made me feel like I belonged.\n\nOnly weeks in, I caught myself basking in a rare day of sunshine, wistfully thinking, \"This is somewhere I could see myself living five years from now.\" Famous last words.\n\nAbout three months after moving to Ireland, I met Frank through friends I'd made. One glimpse was all it took.\n\nSeveral weeks later, we were dating. When my internship ended and I returned to Kentucky, I was eager to get back to Frank as soon as I could — so, we started discussing marriage.\n\nMy parents weren't thrilled to hear I was getting married and moving 4,000 miles away. My mom warned me the distance would be incredibly hard, but I was convinced any homesickness would be manageable and everything would work out … like in a fairy tale.\n\nOnce I was permanently settled in Ireland, the dreamy veneer of this lifestyle began to fade away. Things that hadn't bothered me before suddenly felt like big problems.\n\nFor one thing, finding a nice and affordable rental was more challenging than I expected.\n\nI envisioned our first home together having a patio garden for slow mornings sipping coffee, a guest bedroom for when family came to visit, and a cozy kitchen for gathering with friends.\n\nAfter spending weeks viewing the limited options within our budget — all musty, cramped, soulless one-bedrooms — we finally got lucky and found a small but comfortable place we could afford.\n\nStill, though, I had to give up on my dreams of a garden and spare bedroom, and invest in a good dehumidifier to handle the unrelenting dampness caused by Ireland's frequent rain.\n\nAs my mom predicted, though, the greatest challenge thus far has been dealing with homesickness.\n\nThis was especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, just over five years into my marriage. I'll never forget the video chat with my parents in March 2020, when we discussed whether I should go home or remain in Ireland.\n\nAs a US citizen, I could board one of the few North American flights, but Frank couldn't. It was a moment I never thought I'd face — choosing between my husband and my home.\n\nIn deciding the safest option was to stay put, I didn't know how many months or even years would pass before I'd see my family in Kentucky again.\n\nWhen I see people back home's faces light up after I tell them I live in Ireland, I always want to say it's not as magical as they might imagine … but then, I think of my husband and the life we share.\n\nTogether we've been able to run a business from home, develop our creative interests (acting for him, writing for me), live in a walkable city without a car, enjoy access to amazing local food, and take a cheap flight to Europe whenever wanderlust strikes.\n\nIt's true that Ireland isn't as dreamy in reality as it is on screen, and my homesickness means half of my heart is always somewhere else.\n\nI followed my heart to Ireland, though, and I've chosen to stay because of the love I found here. Perhaps my life is its own type of fairy tale after all.",

    "description": "My festive spin on the Aperol spritz is a crowd-pleaser with or without alcohol. Here's the four-ingredient recipe that a dietitian reviewed for me.",
    "fullText": "For many, the Aperol spritz is reserved for daylight-saving time, falling into the same bucket as loose linen shirts and beach days.\n\nOnce the clock falls back, the quintessential, three-ingredient summer cocktail — made with Aperol, Prosecco, and sparkling water — seems to go into hibernation.\n\nI, however, don't fall into that camp. The bright-orange, refreshing spritz is one of my year-round orders. I've found that with a couple of easy tweaks, an Aperol-based drink can actually be very versatile.\n\nMy version of the classic recipe has become one of my favorite drinks in the fall and winter months, regardless of whether I'm on the sun-drenched Côte d'Azur or in my native drizzly England.\n\nI've seen various versions of this cocktail online with slightly different ratios and ingredients. In my experience, you don't need to be too strict about it.\n\nYou can alter the quantities based on your tastes and preferences, but for one simple spritz, I use the following:\n\nPour the above ingredients into a glass with plenty of ice, and you're done. There's no shaking required.\n\nAlthough the above measurements yield one cocktail, I've scaled the recipe and served it in a large punch bowl or pitcher when hosting friends at my home.\n\nYou can make it stronger by adding a splash of alcoholic spiced apple cider or go for a heavier Aperol pour.\n\nJust keep in mind that Aperol is a distilled spirit with 11% alcohol content, so even when it's diluted, it's worth being mindful of how many units you're having.\n\nTo garnish the drink, you can use a sprig of rosemary, cinnamon sticks, dehydrated orange slices, or cranberries. One of my favorite touches is making big ice cubes with an apple slice or a star anise inside.\n\nAnd if you really love a sweet cocktail, coat the rim of your glass with a bit of cinnamon sugar.\n\nI ran my recipe by dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who said that my festive spritz is a \"lighter, more hydrating option\" than many other popular holiday cocktails.\n\nAs your glass empties, top up your drink with soda water, which Ludlam-Raine explains counteracts alcohol's diuretic effect and helps keep you from getting dehydrated.\n\nIf you're not drinking at all, swap the Aperol for Crodini or Wilfred's aperitif and the prosecco for a nonalcoholic sparkling wine to create a tasty mocktail.\n\n\"I would totally drink this myself and recommend it to my patients,\" Ludlam-Raine told me. \"It's a great way of having a tasty drink without feeling like you're missing out if you're not having alcohol.\"\n\nAlthough Ludlam-Raine said that fruit juice adds flavor and antioxidants, you should be mindful of how much you use to keep your sugar intake in check.\n\nThis is especially true if you're having multiple … which I always am because this drink is that delicious.",

Some of Verizon's rivals also used the outage as an opportunity to take some subtle jabs.\n\n\"Our network? Solid. If you're experiencing issues, it's not us..... it's the other guys. Some things are just out of our hands!\" AT&T said an X post on Wednesday.\n\nT-Mobile told customers that its network was working normally.\n\n\"However due to Verizon's reported outage, our customers may not be able to reach someone with Verizon service at this time,\" the company said in its own X post.",

    "description": "The stars of \"Bridgerton\" season four wore daring sets, statement ball gowns, and chic suits at the world premiere in Paris on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "It's almost time to return to the ton, gentle reader.\n\nThe first episodes of season four of \"Bridgerton\" will drop on Netflix on January 29, with part two premiering on February 26. The season focuses on Benedict Bridgerton's love story with Sophie Baek. Luke Thompson will reprise his role as Benedict, while Yerin Ha will play Sophie.\n\nAhead of the show's Netflix release, the cast of \"Bridgerton\" gathered at the Palais Brongniart in Paris on Wednesday to celebrate the season's world premiere in red-carpet style.\n\nSome stars wore high-fashion outfits that nodded to their characters, while others missed the mark with lackluster suits or dresses that didn't fit the event.\n\nTake a look at some of the best and worst outfits from the \"Bridgerton\" season four premiere.\n\nHa, who stars as Sophie Baek in season four of \"Bridgerton,\" arrived at the premiere in an ice-blue gown designed by Prada.\n\nThe dress had a bedazzled halter neckline that matched the beading on a cutout on the bodice. The floor-length skirt featured two large pleats that cascaded into a train that trailed behind Ha as she walked the red carpet. Sparkly jewelry completed Ha's glamorous look.\n\nThe ensemble looked like a modern take on Cinderella's iconic blue dress. It was fitting since Julia Quinn's \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" upon which season four is based, is a retelling of \"Cinderella.\"\n\nAs he stepped into the leading role of \"Bridgerton,\" Thompson wore an all-black ensemble. He paired a black suit with a black button-down shirt, a black tie, and a black flower on his lapel. The only color on the look was a sparkly tie clip.\n\nThe look was stylish, but the black pieces blended so well that it became difficult to distinguish the different elements, particularly the flower and pin.\n\nSome pops of color may have made the outfit stand out more.\n\nJessie, who plays Eloise Bridgerton, chose an oversize suit for the event.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket and pants were black, but they were adorned with an assortment of flowers in various colors to give the suit some pop. Jessie paired the suit with a slicked-back hairstyle and several earrings and rings, adding a high-fashion edge.\n\nRosheuvel, who plays Queen Charlotte, wore a floor-length sweater dress from Sonney for the premiere. The burnt orange look had a slight sparkle and a cowl neckline, and Rosheuvel wore a matching coat and color-coordinated earrings.\n\nThe outfit was stylish, but it didn't feel formal enough for the red-carpet event. It may have worked better for a daytime press event, or Rosheuvel could have chosen a dress with the same silhouette in a different fabric.\n\nAlli, who plays Lord John Stirling on \"Bridgerton,\" wore an oversize black suit to the event.\n\nHe paired the suit with a white shirt, which he wore without a tie, and it peeked out from the cuffs of his jacket. He added a small silver brooch to his lapel for a chic addition.\n\nThe modern take on a tuxedo exuded high fashion.\n\nDodd, who married John Stirling as Francesca Bridgerton in season three of \"Bridgerton,\" chose a black Giambattista Valli Paris set for the premiere.\n\nThe top was a black, cropped shrug with a V-neck and a button closure that revealed her midriff. It was paired with a low-waisted, calf-length skirt that poofed out around her, giving it a ball-gown feel despite the modern silhouette.\n\nBlack heels and silver jewelry tied Dodd's stylish look together.\n\nThe Lady Danbury actor's custom Torlowei gown for the premiere was beautiful, with a high neckline and black lace detailing.\n\nHowever, Andoh's open-toed black shoes didn't quite match the dress, as they seemed less formal than the gown. Different shoes and statement earrings could have better accented the ensemble.\n\nLeung, who will make her debut on \"Bridgerton\" as Lady Araminta Gun, walked the red carpet in a black Toni Maticevski dress.\n\nIts strapless, scooped neckline formed points for a touch of drama before flowing into a corset bodice. The skirt was structured, poofing out around her waist in a dramatic ball-gown shape before flowing back into a pencil skirt. The center of the dress was made of ribbed fabric, adding dimension.\n\nChopard jewelry and strappy Christian Louboutin heels completed the look. Between the classic detailing, modern flair, and dark color, the dress was the perfect red-carpet companion for the wicked stepmother role Leung will play on the show.\n\nRhimes looked every bit the queen of the ton in the silver gown she wore to the premiere, which was styled by Dana Asher Levine.\n\nThe strapless gown had a slight point in the center of the straight neckline, and it cinched at Rhimes' waist with a belt. The entire gown was covered in silver and bronze sequins arranged in vertical strips, shimmering as Rhimes walked.\n\nThe pièce de résistance was a cape that coordinated with the gown. It sat on Rhimes' shoulder and flowed to the floor, giving the look a regal edge that was more than fitting for the occasion.",

    "fullText": "Amazon's business partnership with luxury retailer Saks Global has hit a sour note.\n\nThe e-commerce giant invested $475 million of preferred equity in Saks Global — the owner of department stores Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf Goodman — in December 2024.\n\nNow, Amazon says its stake is \"presumptively worthless,\" and it has asked a federal judge to reject the retailer's bankruptcy financing plans, which it says will further diminish its chances of recovery.\n\n\"That equity investment is now presumptively worthless after Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners,\" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a court filing on Wednesday, just hours after Saks Global filed for Chapter 11 with a $1.75 billion financing package.\n\nAmazon said in its motion filed in Texas federal bankruptcy court that it \"hopes\" Saks will \"resolve\" its concerns, but warned that it may be forced to \"seek more drastic remedies,\" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee.\n\nAmazon invested the $475 million into Saks as the department store giant finalized its acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group in a $2.7 billion deal, according to the court filing.\n\nAmazon said the investment was conditioned on Saks entering into a commercial agreement with Amazon to sell Saks products on Amazon's website under a \"Saks at Amazon\" storefront.\n\nUnder the agreement, Saks agreed to pay Amazon a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the online platform and guaranteed at least $900 million in payments over eight years to the megacorporation.\n\nAmazon's attorneys argued the bankruptcy plan would hurt the company and other creditors by loading Saks with additional debt. In court filings, Amazon said the financing would \"saddle\" Saks with \"billions of dollars of obligation for no material benefit\" and improperly use the value of Saks Global's flagship entities to prop up other debtors at the expense of their creditors, including Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal judge overseeing Saks' bankruptcy case granted the company approval at a court hearing on Wednesday to tap an initial round of its financing.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Thursday, and representatives for Saks declined to comment.",

    "description": "The advice from five legal experts boiled down to a blunt workplace reality: employees should watch their mouth if they want to keep their job.",
    "fullText": "Hours after President Donald Trump toured a Ford pickup truck assembly plant, the big news story wasn't about manufacturing jobs or the economy. It was about a Ford worker who heckled him and was later suspended.\n\nThe incident raised questions about the limits of free speech in the workplace — and when companies can discipline workers for political protest.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to five experts, including four employment lawyers and an HR executive, to find out.\n\nTheir conclusion was blunt: an employee's words can quickly become fireable offenses.\n\nAll four lawyers said workers retain legal free speech rights under the Constitution, but those rights rarely protect speech in their workplace.\n\n\"With very few exceptions, employees in the private sector don't have free speech rights at work,\" Mark Kluger, a co-founding partner at New Jersey-based law firm Kluger Healey, told Business Insider.\n\nJessica Childress, a managing attorney at Washington, DC-based The Childress Firm, said workers often confuse who the First Amendment actually applies to. The best way to think about it, she said, is to divide government action from a private company's authority.\n\n\"The First Amendment's right to freedom of speech only applies to government actors, not private employers, such as Ford,\" she said. \"A private company can — with certain exceptions — limit what their employees say.\"\n\nThat distinction has played out in real-world cases before.\n\nIn 2017, Juli Briskman, a former marketing analyst for a government contractor, was fired from her job after professional photographers caught her giving Trump's motorcade the middle finger.\n\nEven though her action happened outside of the office, her lawsuit against her employer was tossed.\n\n\"Employers are legally allowed to regulate behavior that disrupts the workplace,\" said Jared Pope, an employment law attorney and CEO at Work Shield. \"That is why most organizations apply their codes of conduct consistently, even when speech happens off the clock or references public figures.\"\n\nStill, lawyers said workers generally have more protection if they express their political belief off-the-clock.\n\n\"If you are so inclined to protest, do it off-duty, off-premises, and off-company networks,\" Eric Kingsley, a partner at Kingsley Szamet Employment Lawyers, told Business Insider. \"An employer has the ability to discipline an employee for speech in matters of politics when it becomes misconduct.\"\n\nEach lawyer we talked to said that Ford was well within its rights to suspend the employee, T.J. Sabula.\n\nIn fact, some said the automaker may have displayed restraint by not outright firing the factory employee after the decision.\n\n\"It implies Ford is buying time,\" Kingsley added. \"Suspending the employee gives them a chance to investigate and make a decision that may not be as rash as laying off an employee.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Auto Workers, the union representing the workers in Sabula's plant, confirmed his suspension. Sabula, who has said he doesn't regret heckling Trump and is set to receive over $800,000 in crowdfunded support, has not responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLaura Dickerson, a vice president for the UAW, said the union was reviewing Ford's actions and said workers \"should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States.\"\n\nThe union also said Sabula \"believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"\n\nFord declined to comment on the suspension, saying it was \"a personnel matter.\"\n\n\"Ford is navigating a high-profile, politically charged moment,\" Lauren Winans, CEO of the HR consulting firm Next Level Benefits, said. \"The union's involvement likely influenced Ford's decision to suspend (not fire), because unilateral termination could lead to grievances and arbitration.\"\n\nFor workers wondering if they can get fired for speaking their mind at work, Kluger made it clear the answer is yes.\n\n\"Try telling your boss what you really think of them and see how long you remain employed,\" he said.",

He probably wouldn't have preferred it, but he said, 'if he's going anywhere, at least he's going to you.'\"\n\nCombs had been at Berkshire since 2010, where he served as CEO of Berkshire-owned Geico and as one of Buffett's two investment managers. In a press release, Buffett said that Combs \"has resigned to accept an interesting and important job at JPMorgan,\" and that the bank made \"a good decision.\"\n\nIn his own press release about the hire, Dimon called Combs, a former member of JPMorgan's board, \"one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known.\" Dimon has praised Buffett time and again over the years, saying that he \"represents everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself\" after the 95-year-old announced he would step down as Berkshire's CEO. Business Insider contacted Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan for comment.\n\nDimon, 69, addressed questions of his own future as a corporate leader during Thursday's interview. When asked whether he wants to stay in the job his characteristic five more years, Dimon said yes, \"at least.\"\n\n\"I love what I do. It's up to the board how long I do it. As long as I have the energy and the spit in the eye and the fire in the gut, yeah, I want to do it,\" he said.\n\nAnd he said he has absolutely no interest in becoming the Fed Chair: \"Absolutely, positively, no chance, no way, no how for any reason.\" (Dimon reiterated the importance of the central bank's independence in the interview, which has come into question in recent days given the Justice Department's investigation. He said that President Donald Trump also thinks we need an independent board.)\n\nIf a president offered him the job of Treasury Secretary, however, Dimon said he would \"consider it.\" He'd need to understand \"what they want and how they want to operate\" before making a decision.\n\nFor now, though, Dimon said he's happy to be his own boss.",

    "description": "Did you really violate the platform's policies, or is it a phishing scheme?",
    "fullText": "If you receive a warning on a LinkedIn post that your account has been restricted, don't engage with it. Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.\n\nAs reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.\n\nScammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended.\n\nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices.\n\nIf you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials.\n\nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.\n\nAs always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages.",

    "description": "And laying off 1,500 people as it pivots from VR to AI wearables.",
    "fullText": "Users of Supernatural got an unpleasant surprise this week: Meta has pulled the plug on its flagship virtual reality fitness app. Citing \"organizational changes,\" Meta says it will no longer release new content or update features for Supernatural.\n\nThe app is not shutting down completely however. Subscribers can still access Supernatural's existing library of Beat Saber-workouts, and Meta says it will maintain the platform and Facebook page, but no new workouts, features, or other content is planned.\n\nBoth users and critics have nearly universally praised Supernatural—CNet scored it 9 out of 10, it won both Fast Company's Best App award in 2020 and a Webby in 2023, and boasted celebrity tie-ins with Jane Fonda and Bon Jovi. Meta doesn't publish subscriber numbers for Supernatural, but there are over 110,000 members of Supernatural's Facebook community. Not enough, apparently, to warrant keeping the app going.\n\nIn 2021, Meta spent an estimated $400 million to purchase Within, Supernatural's developer, even battling the FTC to make the deal, and the app was a heavily promoted part of the company's overall \"Metaverse\" strategy.\n\nThe shuttering of Supernatural is part of a larger shift at Meta. This week, the company laid off 1,500 people—about 10% of the staff—from Reality Labs, Meta's hardware and virtual reality division. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables. This is part of that effort,” a Meta spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlong with cuts at Supernatural, Meta is closing three studios behind some of the most prominent, high-end VR games: Armature, who brought Resident Evil 4 to VR, Sanzaru, the studio behind Asgard’s Wrath, and Twisted Pixel, creators of Deadpool VR.",

    "fullText": "It was an ordeal, one Verizon is literally paying for: The company committed to issuing $20 account credits to affected customers. It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.\n\nThe weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one.\n\nAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears.\n\nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States.",

Are we asking them for the crores and crores of taka [Bangladesh's currency] that we are spending on them? Answer me first.\n\n\"We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything in different places. Have we got any international awards? What have we done at any level?\n\n\"Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn't play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?\"\n\nOne Bangladeshi crore is equivalent to just over £60,000.\n\nIslam's comments drew a swift response from Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB).\n\n\"The remark made by the BCB director has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly and it's not acceptable,\" Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We demand his resignation. If he doesn't resign before tomorrow's match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow.\"\n\nNeither side arrived for Thursday's match between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express, with that fixture and the later match between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans confirmed as being postponed.\n\nThe BCB, in removing Islam from his position, stated: \"Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president has decided to release Mr Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.\n\n\"The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority. The board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt said all cricketers should \"display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game\" and called for BPL matches to be played as planned.\n\nBangladesh's T20 World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 7 February against West Indies in Kolkata, with a match against England on Saturday, 14 February due to take place at the same venue, Eden Gardens.\n\nThe Bangladesh Premier League has six group games left to play, leading into a four-match knockout stage, finishing with a final in Dhaka on Friday, 23 January.",

By Sunday morning, sports fans across the United Kingdom knew the country had a new world champion - its fifth reigning male titleholder.\n\n\"I feel like it's still yet to sink in properly now. But in a way it's not as big of a shock to me because it's something I always worked towards,\" Smith says.\n\n\"In the way I did it, overseas and everything against us, I feel like it made the story that much better.\"\n\nBBC Sport looks at how Smith overcame the odds to pull off one of the most striking British victories on American soil.",

And they've lost Brooks.\"\n\nFormer US Open champion Wyndham Clark, who played in the 2023 Ryder Cup alongside Koepka, says he is \"torn\" on his compatriot's return to the PGA calendar after turning down an approach from LIV himself.\n\n\"I personally really like Brooks, and I think it's ultimately really good for the PGA Tour, but also, you know, a guy that had an opportunity to go to LIV, it's kind of frustrating that he's able to get the cake and also eat it,\" Clark said.\n\n\"I had the offer. It was just over a year and a half ago. And if you would have told me that I could have gone for a year and a half, make a boatload of money and then be able to come back and play on the Tour, I think almost everyone would have done that.\"",

Just a little smile, but one no doubt hiding immense disappointment.\n\nYet again, his Egypt side had failed at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) and, yet again, they had fallen against Senegal and Sadio Mane - Salah's ex-Liverpool team-mate.\n\nAcross the five games Salah started in Morocco, the 33-year-old scored four goals as he carried his nation to the semi-finals.\n\nAfter their quarter-final win against the Ivory Coast, Salah described it as the \"best camp\" he'd ever had.\n\n\"We're all close, we love each other, we hang out together, the humour is unbelievable, and we work hard both on and off the pitch,\" said Salah.\n\nSalah is expected to return to Merseyside, where uncertainty still remains over his future, following Saturday's third-place play-off against Nigeria in Casablanca.\n\nSalah last started a game for Liverpool on 26 November in the Champions League against PSV, which Arne Slot's side lost 4-1.\n\nSince then, Liverpool are 11 games unbeaten (W6, D5), though the performances have been questionable - with Slot admitting last week he did not \"completely disagree\" with suggestions the Reds' football has been \"dull and boring\" during that period.\n\nIt is also over a month since Salah gave an explosive mixed zone interview at Leeds, where he accused Liverpool of \"throwing him under the bus\" after he was benched for three games in a row, and claimed his relationship with Slot had broken down.\n\nHe was subsequently left out for Liverpool's trip to Inter Milan but was not fined and returned to the squad against Brighton a few days later, coming off the bench in the first half when Joe Gomez was injured.\n\nSalah got an assist in the second half and was given a warm reception by the Anfield crowd, before staying to applaud all four sides of the ground after full-time as they serenaded their \"Egyptian King\" with his familiar song. That was his last appearance before joining up with his national team.\n\nSlot insisted after that there was \"no issue to resolve\", with Curtis Jones also revealing Salah had apologised to his team-mates for the fallout from his interview.\n\nIn his absence Liverpool have not lost a game, but they have lost striker Alexander Isak to a lower leg injury until at least March, while defender Conor Bradley has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.",

The announcement isn't a total surprise, though, as some theorized this would be the case after the developer announced that the MMO would get no more new content after the Nighthaven seasonal update last year. In October 2025, Amazon cut more jobs at its gaming division that specifically impacted the MMO teams.\nAeternum's final day on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S is January 31, 2027.

    "description": "We're called GameSpot, so we clearly love to play some video games. You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.\nIn a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal and reported on by Medical Xpress, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects \"excessive gaming\" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that \"high gamers\"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.",

    "fullText": "Dan Troccoli, a public middle school teacher, says everyone should start “emulating” Minneapolis’s resistance to ICE and the Trump regime.\n\nThousands of ICE thugs roam the streets, attacking schools, smashing car windows, shooting residents, and “visiting” activists in their homes. Now President Donald Trump is threatening to impose the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to flood the city with troops. Welcome to Minneapolis during the Trump regime.\n\nWhat is happening in Minneapolis is a fascist shit show, but there is also grassroots resistance. The oppression is all over the news, but the stories of ordinary people fighting back need to be told, too. Dan Troccoli, a public school teacher at Justice Page Middle School and union activist, says that the battle for Minneapolis is not a one-sided rout by ICE—if it was, there would not be these threats to impose martial law.\n\n“Many people around the city have been going around patrolling and keeping an eye on these agents,” he told me. “There are estimates as high as 10,000 people that have been involved in the city in these efforts in the last six weeks. Given the legacy of the uprisings after [the 2020 police murder of] George Floyd, people in the city have been activated for years now. I would argue we were Trump’s target for that reason, but it’s not going exactly like they planned, and people need to know that.”\n\nOne example of things “not going exactly like they planned” happened at Roosevelt High School. Only hours after the ICE killing of Renee Good, ICE tried to storm the gates of Roosevelt, when a person they were pursuing ran onto school grounds just as students were heading home. Instead of retreating, ICE assaulted and gassed students and educators. But their attack was met. “In our union, in the Minneapolis Federation of Educators, there has been now, for about a year and a half, a group of educators calling themselves the Deportation Defense Group,” Trocolli explained. “So at Roosevelt, they were ready, and we had a network of people ready to go on this, and we have been doing training around how to be an observer, how to go on patrol, what are the most risky times for students to be dropped off or picked up, and how can we do mutual aid for families who can’t even pick up their kids. So the staff members at Roosevelt were outside of the building ready to ID ICE and physically get in between them and their students.”\n\nBut ICE aggressively pushed forward and then struck and sprayed chemical agents on students and staff. After all of that, ICE arrested one educator, who was then let go hours after the union’s lawyers were on the scene.\n\nThe Minneapolis teachers’ unions (there are two) have been front and center in this fight: opening up their halls for meetings every night, partnering with parent organizations, and holding training sessions.\n\n“This past weekend,” Troccoli recalled, “we had a training at one of our high schools, and there were something like 300 parents and staff mixed together, working together to try and organize in their buildings. At recent meetings of this same network of Unionists in MFE, there have been something like 60 to 70 percent of schools represented. And I would imagine it’s much higher now since Renee’s murder, with more buildings getting activated, involved, mostly out of fear and concern for their students’ safety.”\n\nTroccoli stressed that the union’s leadership and active response to the crisis comes from having a unique union president: Marcia Howard. Howard taught at Roosevelt for 20 years. When George Floyd was murdered, she, still a teacher, “was the coordinator, and hub of George Floyd Square.”\n\nHoward took the entire year off then to do this work, turning George Floyd Square into a kind of autonomous zone, and both teachers’ unions made sure she was paid during this time. This drew her closer to the union. Howard, with grassroots encouragement, ran for union vice president and president. “She’s just been a fiery and amazing leader for our union,” Troccoli said, “especially in terms of trying to marry union struggles with other social justice struggles in the city.”\n\nIn the face of this resistance, ICE is upping its oppression. Agents are showing up at the homes of people who follow ICE in their cars even at a safe distance are—no matter their citizenship. Troccoli also said that when these ICE-watchers leave their cars, phones in hand, to document their violence, they have been hit, without warning, with mace, pepper balls, and “nonlethal” bullet rounds.\n\nAnd yet ICE violence has yielded not compliance and pacification but even more resistance. Troccoli said, “A number of unions in the city are now committing to a day-long strike on January 23.” This call already includes the backings of some of the biggest unions in the city including, according to PayDay Report, The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1005, SEIU Local 26, UNITE HERE Local 17, CWA Local 7250, and St. Paul Federation of Educators Local 28, with more coming. “We’re not sure exactly what’s going to happen that day yet,” Troccoli said. “But it’s happening.\n\nAs far as what people can do Troccoli told me that social media support definitely keeps spirits up but “in addition to appreciation, we want emulation. We need that out there in the streets in every city”",

    "fullText": "We can turn the tide against Trump—but only with mass action and courageous leadership.\n\nShortly after dropping her 6-year-old son off at school, Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.\n\nRepublican leaders attempted to smear Good as a “domestic terrorist” and claim that Ross acted in “self-defense.” But the incident was caught on video, and we all saw it: an ICE agent murdering a 37-year-old mother. Good was also a US citizen, the demographic that ICE is claiming to protect.\n\nICE’s purpose in Minnesota has been to sow chaos and terror, with a focus in Minneapolis, one of the most diverse areas in the state. Many residents feel like they’re living under occupation. ICE agents are snatching residents from bus stops. Black and brown US citizens are carrying their passports everywhere to keep from being kidnapped by federal agents. Businesses are struggling as people are afraid to show up to work. Schools are on lockdown as ICE shows up to harass and assault students and educators. And now ICE has shot and killed a neighbor.\n\nWhile the violence of occupation is not the standard in Minneapolis, these recent events feel all too familiar. Good’s murder occurred just six blocks from where Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd. A badge does not give you a license to kill with impunity. We did not quietly accept the murder of George Floyd in 2020, and we will not accept the murder of Renee Good now.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has outrageously claimed that ICE is helping to keep people safe. What’s become blatantly clear is that ICE is the biggest threat to our community’s safety. That’s why the first demand from Minneapolis residents has been for ICE to leave.\n\nThousands of residents, including Good, have been organizing to protect our neighbors. Delivering groceries to families, so no one is abducted while trying to feed their loved ones. Walking kids to schools so families aren’t torn apart on the way home. Distributing whistles, so we can alert our neighbors when ICE is on our streets. These actions aren’t always visible, but they are helping to keep families together.\n\nAs a local elected official, I am working with my colleagues to push our governor to take action to keep families in their homes by instituting an eviction moratorium. Governor Tim Walz can show the rest of the nation that Democrats can resist Trump and protect residents targeted by the administration’s cruel policies. Hundreds of families are unable to safely go to work, and shouldn’t have to choose between keeping a roof over their heads and risking being permanently separated from their loved ones.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty announced Friday that they are conducting an independent investigation into the killing of Good, a crucial step as we cannot trust Trump’s agencies to conduct a fair arrest, investigation, or trial.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nBut to truly put an end to ICE and the rising tide of fascism under Trump, the Democratic Party must take immediate and bold action for the following:\n\nWinning these demands require more than just voting. We need national-level labor organizing for strikes and shutdowns to interrupt the economy and force a change of course until we can all live free from the fear of being kidnapped or shot by armed agents. The ICE Out of Minnesota Economic Blackout planned for January 23 is a great start.\n\nBecause while the eyes of the world have once again turned to Minneapolis after a man with a badge killed one of our neighbors, this is a national problem.\n\nLess than 48 hours after an ICE agent killed Good, federal agents shot two people in Portland. They’ve already targeted Los Angeles, Chicago, and New Orleans. It could be your city next. As long as ICE exists, nobody is safe—not even a 37-year-old mom and US citizen. It’s going to take all of us doing our parts to end this violence.\n\nThis moment will go down in history, but we have a choice about how. If we do nothing, this will mark the beginning of a period where federal agents can kill us with impunity.\n\nBut if we act, we can make this the moment that finally turned the tide against rising fascism and ended Trump’s attacks on our communities. The time for mass action is now—let’s make this the last life stolen by ICE.",
