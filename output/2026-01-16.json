    "fullText": "Cubs could move Matt Shaw to the outfield after Alex Bregman signing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs have been aggressive in recent weeks, trading for Miami Marlins starter Edward Cabrera and signing former Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox infielder Alex Bregman to a five-year $175 million contract.\n\nIf the Cubs retain Nico Hoerner, there won't be space for Matt Shaw to play everyday in the infield. That said, Chicago Cubs president Jed Hoyer proposed a different solution.\n\nAccording to Jesse Rogers of ESPN, Hoyer hinted at the idea of playing Shaw in the outfield in order to get in the lineup more often.\n\nAlthough he doesn't have big league experience in the outfield, right field seems to be the best fit. Pete Crow-Armstrong and Ian Happ are known to play exceptional defense in both center and right field. Happ has won four consecutive Gold Glove awards while Crow-Armstrong won his first last season.\n\nAssuming Kyle Tucker departs in free agency, Shaw could split time with Seiya Suzuki in right. Suzuki only made 48 appearances in the outfield last season, but posted negative two defensive runs saved at the position in 2024.\n\nShaw splitting time at the position could relieve Suzuki from time to time and keep him in a more comfortable position at designated hitter. He excelled in this role last season, hitting a career-high 32 home runs and driving in 103 runs.\n\nEither way, Shaw could get time at second base if Hoerner is traded, something that Chicago has yet to take off the table.\n\nNevertheless, adding the outfield to his repertoire will make him a more versatile piece for the Cubs moving forward.\n\nPhillies linked to slugger with over 200 career home runs\n\nGiants linked to add Marlins' starter via trade\n\nGiants reveal contract guarantees and bonuses for new starter Tyler Mahle\n\nAthletics agree to extension with Tyler Soderstrom after breakout season\n\nAthletics eye rotation upgrades after Jeff McNeil trade\n\nHa-Seong Kim returns to the Braves on a one-year contract\n\nSan Francisco has 'checked in on' Cody Bellinger amid free agency",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots and Houston Texans will look to bring themselves one step closer to ultimate glory in their divisional round matchup on Sunday.\n\nI’ve put together the keys to victory for both sides:\n\nThe Texans’ defensive style is legitimately fascinating, as they ranked first in total defensive EPA (-130.69) and points allowed per game (16.7) while also ranking dead last in blitz rate (21.6%) and simulated pressure rate (29.7%) — all while playing more man-coverage (67.9%) and single-high coverage (74.8%) than anyone in 2025.\n\nKamari Lassiter, Jalen Pitre, Danielle Hunter, Derek Stingley Jr. and Will Anderson Jr. make it pretty easy to take those risks…\n\nI don’t necessarily know if there’s a way to “take advantage” given that group’s undeniable talent, but if there was it would involve trusting the league’s most accurate deep-ball quarterback to exploit that loyalty to simplicity.\n\nDrake Maye isn’t your typical sophomore signal-caller, but there are aspects to his game that need to be cleaned up.\n\nMaye’s unwillingness to accept defeat on individual plays is an issue, and it came back to bite him in the ass during last weekend’s wild-card victory over the Los Angeles Chargers — leading to two fumbles on five sacks.\n\nHouston defensive coordinator Matt Burke won’t stray from what made his defense the best in football, but perhaps making slight schematic changes can throw a wrench in things and present them with a few opportunities to take advantage of one of the youngster’s few bad habits.\n\nJosh McDaniels has plenty of friends down in Houston, Texas.\n\nTexans general manager Nick Caserio, offensive coordinator Nick Caserio, special teams coordinator Frank Ross, offensive line coach Cole Popovich, offensive assistant Jerry Schuplinski and wide receivers coach Ben McDaniels — you can put two and two together on that one — previously worked with the guy, so they know exactly what he’s capable of and most comfortable with doing.\n\nI’d expect there to be a few wrinkles in the offensive gameplan — perhaps we see the Wing-T or the Wildcat. I just don’t think we’ll see that tired old flea flicker, the double pass, or that quarterback throwback he seems to be obsessed with.\n\nIt’s a simple formula; build an early lead, run the football, watch your defense dominate.\n\nThe Texans have been built to do exactly that, but the only way it works is if you’re able to run the ball effectively. Woody Marks, Nick Chubb, Jawhar Jordan, Dare Ogunbowale and British Brooks have combined for precisely two 100-yards games in 2025, but one of those came in their wild-card victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers…\n\nFrom the goal line to midfield!\n\nBig gain for Rhamondre Stevenson 😤\n\nLACvsNE on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/8VkxijZMq0\n\n“If you want to control the game, you have to win on first downs.”\n\nNo, if you want to control this game, you have to win on second down.\n\nHouston is the best second-down defense in football, as they force an average of eight yards to gain on third downs. New England needs to stay ahead of the chains, but especially on second down as it will allow for more options on third downs.\n\nWill Campbell and Jared Wilson didn’t exactly have the best postseason debuts, giving up four sacks and 10 total pressures, and things are only going to get more difficult against a unit that ranked first in opponent passer rating (75.0), third in opponent completion percentage (58.92%) and eighth in sack percentage (7.59%).\n\nI’d say it’s a bit of a mismatch…\n\nDerek Barnett, Denico Autry, Sheldon Rankins, Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. are pressure machines, but they’ll need to finish in order to actually make a difference in this one. Drake Maye finished with a 102.6 passer rating when under pressure in 2025.\n\nIf you’re going to stop him, you have to get home.\n\nAdam Schefter Delivers Fiery Take On Eagles’ A.J.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRunning backs have a short shelf life in the NFL, and for players who are bell cows, that is even more so, yet Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry continues to buck that trend.\n\nNormally, we see production start to decline once players reach their late 20s, but in Henry's case, he's still the All-Pro we've known for years.\n\nIn 2025, despite the Ravens' struggles, Henry still posted 1,595 yards and 16 touchdowns at the ripe age of 31. That's ridiculous.\n\nAnd for Maurice Jones-Drew, in his top 64 starting running backs piece for NFL.com, Henry came in at No. 6.\n\n“Other than some early-season fumbling issues, Henry had one hell of a season at 31 years old,” Jones-Drew wrote. “The ageless wonder continued to trounce defenses and finished the season with an absolute bang, rushing for 570 yards and six touchdowns on 85 carries over the final four games.\n\n\"That's 6.7 per clip. Normally, the football world starts to wonder when 31-year-old running backs will consider hanging 'em up. Henry feels far from it.”\n\nMore:Ravens make $74.5 million contract stance clear with Lamar Jackson\n\nMost 31-year-old running backs just want to be productive for their teams.\n\nBut in Henry's case, he's dominating.\n\nIn his last seven NFL seasons, Henry has surpassed 1,500 rushing yards five times and has had 16 rushing TDs four times. Let that sink in.\n\nPlus, he's played every regular-season game in the last three years. That speaks to his longevity in the game.\n\nSome thought Henry was declining when he joined Baltimore in 2024 after a 1,167-yard, 12-TD season in 2023, but he's shown that, at least right now, Father Time is going to have to wait.\n\n2 huge roster decisions could define new Ravens HC\n\nSteve Bisciotti didn't want 'jerk move' to happen to Ravens ex John Harbaugh\n\nWhy Ravens owner was right to fire John Harbaugh\n\nRavens owner makes outstanding Lamar Jackson contract stance",

    "fullText": "Bruised and battle-hardened, Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills face Denver on Saturday as their star quarterback seeks to reach his first Super Bowl and add the NFL's biggest prize to his list of accolades.\n\nThe league's reigning Most Valuable Player suffered a head blow, a sprained knee and a hand injury in last weekend's hard-fought clash with Jacksonville, but almost single-handedly dragged his team over the line.\n\nNow, Allen has been cleared fit to play against the Broncos -- the AFC's top seed -- in their highly anticipated divisional round game, knowing victory would leave them just one win away from next month's NFL championship decider.\n\n\"I feel good. Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks,\" Allen, who has also been managing a long-term foot injury, told a press conference.\n\nAllen's run of 122 consecutive starts is the longest streak among active quarterbacks and has led to his teammates and fans jokingly referring to him as \"Superman.\"\n\nBut the quarterback, who hails from the agricultural Central Valley of California, told reporters his toughness came from being a \"country boy\" from \"out in the middle of nowhere.\"\n\nHe also acknowledged that the defensive line he will be facing is notoriously robust.\n\n\"They've got some absolute studs over there. Obviously they rush the passer extremely well,\" said Allen.\n\n\"Interior, again, some big stout guys that can really push the pocket.\"\n\nFor Denver, the match-up comes after a bye week, and offers another chance to prove that one of this season's surprise packages can be the real deal at the business end of the campaign.\n\nDespite finishing top of the AFC with the league's joint best record (14-3), the Broncos figure only fifth on the betting market's predicted Super Bowl winners.\n\nStar cornerback Pat Surtain said the team would be relying on a raucous crowd to spur them on for the Broncos' first postseason home game since 2015.\n\n\"I know the atmosphere is going to be crazy, the stadium is going to be rocking,\" Surtain said.\n\n\"I can already feel the magnitude of it,\" he added.\n\nIt is also a chance for the Broncos to avenge last year's devastating 31-7 playoff loss in Buffalo.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, the injury-ravaged San Francisco 49ers will attempt the next step in their bid to reach a home-field Super Bowl by taking on the high-flying Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe clash pits the two divisional rivals against each other for the second time in three weeks.\n\nAs top seeds in the NFC, the Seahawks also had a bye last weekend. By contrast the 49ers -- who have been decimated by a deepening injury crisis for much of the season -- suffered yet another cruel blow against Philadelphia, when tight end George Kittle tore his Achilles tendon.\n\n\"We've kind of been in a hole for about seven months and once you get to the playoffs, it really doesn't matter,\" said 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, of the non-stop schedule.\n\n\"Everyone's into it. So, whether they gave us three days, one day, eight days... whenever you get dealt your hand, you're ready to roll.\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl will be held at the 49ers' home stadium, in Santa Clara, California, on February 8.\n\nIn Sunday's remaining divisional round games, the New England Patriots will host the Houston Texans, and the Los Angeles Rams travel to the Chicago Bears.",

    "fullText": "Serena Williams teased fans with an unlikely return to tennis late last year, with her name having appeared on a drug testing pool.\n\nWilliams immediately shut down the excitement of a potential comeback, with her decision to retire seemingly not changing anytime soon.\n\nThe American legend called time on her glittering career in 2022, leaving tennis with 23 Grand Slam titles to her name.\n\nAnd just a few weeks later, her fellow legend Roger Federer made the same decision, retiring with 20 Grand Slam titles.\n\nFederer is now in Melbourne for the Australian Open, where he was asked about Williams potentially making a return.\n\nHe said of his fellow 44-year-old: “I heard she entered the doping program. Then I heard she’s not coming back.”\n\nAnd when asked why she would put her name down if she wasn’t considering a comeback, he said: “Miss those things, you know.\n\n“So much fun to always think about. That’s one of the big things I was happy to retire at the end, not to have that in my mind.\n\n“For the game, it would be incredible. Serena is such a legend to come back. Also the stories as a mom, with Belinda [Bencic]. It resonates with everyone in the room.\n\n“If she decides not to do it, I would maybe give herself an option. It’s great to have options in life, in my opinion. Let’s see what she does and wait for an announcement or not. Then we’ll see.”\n\nIt remains to be seen what decision Williams takes going forward, but most tennis fans would welcome her back onto the court with open arms.\n\nIntriguingly, her sister is back playing at the age of 45, with Venus Williams set to take on the 2026 Australian Open.\n\nThe veteran has received a wildcard for the Grand Slam, and could potentially face Coco Gauff in round two if she wins her opener against Olga Danilovic.\n\nMeanwhile, Federer’s compatriot Bencic will take on Katie Boulter after her impressive displays at the United Cup earned her the MVP award.\n\nHer 5-0 singles record has also helped her become the first mother since Serena Williams in 2021 to break the WTA top 10.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid are hoping to return to winning ways on Saturday when they host Levante, but they will be without the services of star striker Kylian Mbappe for the La Liga clash at the Bernabeu.\n\nIt has been a difficult week for Real Madrid, who lost to Barcelona in the Spanish Supercup final before being dumped out of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday by Segunda side Albacete. In this period, Xabi Alonso also left his position as head coach, which has been filled by Alvaro Arbeloa.\n\nArbeloa will take charge of his first home match as Real Madrid manager, but as was the case for his debut against Albacete, he will be without Mbappe. As per Marca, the French forward will not be risked at the Bernabeu, given that he is still struggling with discomfort from the knee injury he sustained pre-winter break.\n\nMbappe trained during Thursday’s session and did not appear to have any issues, but internally, it has been decided that he will not be involved against Levante. He played through the pain barrier during last weekend’s Superclasico defeat, but there is a desire for no more risks to be taken with his recovery.\n\nMbappe’s absence will almost certainly mean that Gonzalo Garcia will continue as the starting striker. The 21-year-old has been impressive in the Frenchman’s absence, with five goals in his last four appearances – which includes a hattrick against Real Betis, one in El Clasico, and one in the Copa del Rey defeat to Albacete.\n\nGonzalo will fancy his chances to continue his good form against Levante. Real Madrid need to get back to winning ways as soon as possible, although it won’t be easy against an opponent that is unbeaten in their last three matches.",

    "fullText": "Ohio quarterback Parker Navarro has entered the NCAA Transfer Portal, On3’s Pete Nakos has learned. He’s spent the past four seasons with the Bobcats.\n\nNavarro played high school football at Desert Vista (Phoenix, AZ), where he was a three-star prospect. He was the No. 1308 overall recruit in the 2020 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted algorithm that complies all major recruiting media services. He originally committed to UCF.\n\nOver the course of his collegiate career, Navarro has passed for 5,030 yards and 30 touchdowns, while rushing for 30 touchdowns, as well. He’ll be looking to step up to a bigger stage and make an impact in 2026.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCAA Division I Administrative Committee passed dates for the one-time-only college football transfer portal back earlier in October. As it stands, the 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days. It’ll span Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA announced.\n\nMoving forward, the entire Division I football notification of transfer windows is slated for Jan 2-16. As has been the previous standard, athletes on College Football Playoff teams still playing would have 5 days beginning the day after their team’s final game to enter the transfer portal.\n\nAdditionally, players have 15 days to enter the portal, but they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the deadline for committing is how late a school can enroll a player through admissions.\n\nOne caveat is that if a head coach is fired, the transfer portal will not open for players immediately. The NCAA revealed that moving forward, players will only have 15 days to enter the portal after a coaching change, instead of the former allocation of 30 days. Players will also have to wait five days after a new coach is hired or announced.\n\nFinally, graduate transfers also cannot enter the transfer portal until Jan. 2 with the new one-time-only portal window. All these new guidelines are bound to shake things up, but the transfer portal will still remain as interesting and entertaining as ever.",

    "fullText": "Ben Sherman is dressing Team GB for the Olympics—here's your first look originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBen Sherman is heading back to the Olympic stage.\n\nAccording to Flaunt, the British heritage label has been confirmed as the Official Ceremony Wear Supplier for Team GB at the upcoming Milano Cortina 2026, marking the fourth straight Games in which the brand has outfitted the delegation for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies.\n\nMORE: Savannah James melts Lebron's heart with stunning new look\n\nFor this Winter Games cycle, Ben Sherman leaned into cold-weather functionality while keeping its tailoring roots intact. The ceremonial wardrobes are designed to balance warmth, movement, and visual identity—key requirements for athletes stepping into the spotlight during two of the most-watched moments of the Games.\n\nA major element of the collection comes from the brand’s collaboration with five-time Olympic medalist and Paris 2024 flagbearer Tom Daley. Daley helped design the hand-knit scarves and winter hats worn by Team GB athletes carrying the Union Flag. The accessories feature bold GB lettering and textured cable-knit patterns inspired by the snowy landscape surrounding northern Italy.\n\n“Having had the honour of serving as a Flagbearer for Team GB during my last Olympic Games, I understand how powerful that moment is,” Daley said. “It’s more than carrying a flag; it’s carrying the stories, hopes, and identity of everyone who made that journey with you.”\n\nThe Opening Ceremony look centers on a wool dogtooth topcoat with a chequered lining, layered over a mock-neck sweater woven with raised stripes and a repeating Union Flag motif. Tailored sweat joggers with tonal detailing and winter boots with Vibram soles complete the ensemble, offering a clean mix of tradition and performance-ready design.\n\nFor the Closing Ceremony, the silhouettes soften. Athletes will wear a chunky wool-blend knitted track jacket featuring Team GB’s zig-zag illustration, paired with a navy and ecru merino roll-neck for warmth without bulk.\n\nBen Sherman’s campaign spotlighting the collection features British ice dancers Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson, whose movement-driven visuals echo the rhythm and unity of the team itself.\n\nMORE: Karrueche Tran shows off cute bob amid Deion Sanders romance\n\nBehind the scenes, global brand owner Marquee Brands sees the partnership as a natural fit.

    "title": "Tennessee Titans head coach search: Ranking the remaining candidates",
    "description": "The Tennessee Titans head coaching search continues, so we ranked the remaining candidates and grouped them into tiers.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans are still searching for their next head coach, and with the news that John Harbaugh was hired by the New York Giants, his meeting with the Titans was cancelled. Harbaugh would have been a solid hire, if the Titans had landed him, but they never got a shot.\n\nHe wasn't the only candidate the Titans had, though. They've already completed seven interviews and have more scheduled in the coming weeks. Let's take a look at the remaining candidates the Titans will consider, ranked in tiers.\n\nJason Garrett, NBC personality: While he has head coaching experience with the Dallas Cowboys, Garrett hasn't coached since he was fired by the New York Giants in 2021. He was 85-67 during his 10 years as head coach, but 2-3 in the playoffs.\n\nSteve Spagnuolo, DC, Chiefs: Spags has spent most of his coaching career as a defensive coordinator, with a short stint as head coach of the (then) St. Louis Rams. He's been with the Kansas City Chiefs since 2019, helping the Chiefs to three Super Bowl victories and multiple playoff appearances.\n\nRaheem Morris, former HC, Falcons: Morris has been coaching in the NFL since 2002, earning his first head coaching gig with the Tampa By Buccaneers in 2009-2011. His second head coaching role would be with the Falcons from 2024-2025. His record as a head coach is 35-56.\n\nJonathan Gannon, former HC, Cardinals: Gannon was fired by the Cardinals after his third season as head coach. In his only head coaching role, the Cardinals failed to make the playoffs or record a winning season. His overall record is 15-36.\n\nBrian Daboll, former HC, Giants: Daboll spent eight years as an offensive coordinator before landing the head coaching role with the Giants. Over his four years in New York, Daboll's Giants were 20-40-1, and 1-1 in the playoffs. The playoff appearance was his first season with the team, but they could not find success again.\n\nLou Anarumo, DC, Colts: While Anarumo does not have head coaching experience, he has quickly risen up the ranks in the NFL coaching world. He joined the Dolphins in 2012 as their defensive backs coach and was a defensive coordinator by 2019. In 2025, he was instrumental in the team's 8-2 start before the Colts lost their last seven games.\n\nKliff Kingsbury, former OC, Commanders: After 10 years as a college coach, Kingsbury was hired by the Arizona Cardinals as head coach. In his four years there, the Cardinals were 28-37 and 0-1 in the playoffs. He returned to the college scene in 2023 before joining the Washington Commanders as offensive coordinator in 2024. The two sides mutually parted following the Commanders' five-win season in 2025.\n\nJeff Hafley, DC, Packers: Another coach who has spent more time at the collegiate level than the professional level, Hafley's defense ranked 10th in the NFL in passing this season. The run defense was mediocre, especially after Micah Parsons was injured. He has not been a head coach at the professional level.\n\nMatt Nagy, OC, Chiefs: Nagy already has ties to Tennessee through Mike Borgonzi, as the two worked together in Kansas City for a number of years. He also has previous head coaching experience with the Chicago Bears, where he was 34-31 but couldn't get past the Wild Card round of the playoffs.\n\nChris Shula, DC, Rams: Shula's name alone carries weight as he comes from a family of storied coaches, including his grandfather, Don Shula. He's worked his way up the ranks in the Los Angeles Rams' organization as a defensive guy, and while he's not held a head coaching position, coming from the Sean McVay coaching tree certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nJesse Minter, DC, Chargers: Minter has not held a head coaching role in his career. He had a brief stint with the Baltimore Ravens in various defensive roles, but most of his experience is collegiate. He joined the Los Angeles Chargers in 2024, following Jim Harbaugh from Michigan, where the two worked together since 2019.\n\nVance Joseph, DC, Broncos: Joseph is a defensive guy who had a two-year stint as head coach of the Denver Broncos. The Broncos were 5-11 and 6-10 in his first two seasons, leading to his firing. However, his current defense was one of the top in the NFL in 2025, which is partly why the Broncos are still in the playoffs.\n\nRobert Saleh, DC, 49ers: Saleh's one stint as a head coach was with the New York Jets, and we won't hold that against him. He was 20-36 as head coach of the Jets, but the Jets haven't been relevant since Rex Ryan left, so there's a bit of a caveat there. His 49ers defense is still in the playoffs in 2025, so he's doing something right.\n\nMike McDaniel, former HC, Dolphins: One of the few offensive-minded coaches in the running, McDaniel was 35-33 and 0-2 in the playoffs as head coach of the Miami Dolphins, but his experience in developing Tua Tagovailoa will be instrumental in the development of Cam Ward. He remains a top contender in Tennessee.\n\nMike McCarthy, former HC, Cowboys: McCarthy is a veteran head coach with 18 years of head coaching experience. He spent 13 years with the Green Bay Packers, where they made nine playoff appearances and won a Super Bowl, and five years with the Dallas Cowboys. His overall record is 174-112-2. He only had five losing seasons and one season at .500, while the rest show a winning record.\n\nKevin Stefanski, former HC, Browns: Stefanski's head coaching record is 45-56 and 1-2 in the playoffs. But he took the Cleveland Browns to the playoffs after a 17-year absence. He was saddled with a ridiculous quarterback situation, among other things, so we'll put him in the same category as Saleh and not hold that against him. The offense struggled for several reasons, but the Browns' defense ranked near the top of the league in several categories in 2025. He is a two-time NFL Coach of the Year.\n\nArthur Smith, OC, Steelers: Smith entered the NFL in 2011 as a defensive quality control coach in 2011. He remained with the team through 2020 and was part of three playoff runs. As head coach of the Falcons in 2021-2023, he was 21-30 with zero playoff appearances. The Steelers have made the playoffs for the last two seasons, but lost in the Wild Card round each time.\n\nThe Titans have a ton of options at head coach. Some are better than others, and most of us would like to see a combination of these names join the organization for a complete reset.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Tennessee Titans: Ranking the remaining head coaching candidates",

    "description": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif.",
    "fullText": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — Another season, another gut punch. The Los Angeles Chargers walked off the field after yet another playoff loss, and once again the uncomfortable truth is staring the organization — and its fan base — directly in the face: Justin Herbert is now 0–3 in the postseason.\n\nAt some point, the excuses have to stop.\n\nFor years, Herbert has been sold as the answer. The golden-armed franchise quarterback. The future Hall of Famer. The one who would finally erase six decades of Chargers heartbreak. But three playoff games is no longer “too small a sample size.” It’s a pattern — and it’s an ugly one.\n\n#Chargers GM Joe Horitz discussed whether he set Justin Herbert up to succeed.\n\n“At times we did, at times we didn’t,” Hortiz said. “Until we win a Super Bowl, I’ll tell you we weren’t good enough.”@SportingTrib | #BoltUp pic.twitter.com/zAHwaKg4Mi\n\n— Fredo Cervantes (@FredoCervantes) January 15, 2026\n\nThis latest Wild Card loss was supposed to be different. New leadership. A championship pedigree head coach. A staff that, by all accounts, did enough to put Herbert in position to win. Yet when the lights were brightest, Herbert was nowhere to be found. No urgency. No takeover moment. No signature drive. Just another quiet exit.\n\nAnd no, this one doesn’t fall on Greg Roman.\n\nRoman paid the price with his job, but firing him feels more like organizational therapy than accountability. Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh called it a “fresh start” and a “results-oriented” decision. Fair enough. But if we’re truly being results-oriented, then the conversation can’t keep stopping everywhere except the quarterback.\n\nChargers GM Joe Hortiz was refreshingly honest when asked whether the team put Herbert in position to succeed.\n\n“At times we did, at times we didn’t,” Hortiz said. “Until we win a Super Bowl, I’ll tell you we weren’t good enough.”\n\nThat’s the most truthful statement made by anyone in the building — and it applies directly to Herbert.\n\nHarbaugh, predictably, defended his quarterback.\n\nWinners show up when it matters. Winners elevate in January. Winners don’t shrink in three straight playoff appearances. Herbert hasn’t just lost — he has underperformed relative to his own elite regular-season standard. And that’s the part Chargers fans are tired of ignoring.\n\nThis franchise hasn’t won a Super Bowl in over 60 years. Sixty. That’s generations of loyal fans investing emotionally, financially, and spiritually into a team that continually finds new ways to fall short. The Chargers don’t need pretty throws in September. They need wins in January.\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nLos Angeles Chargers quarterback, Justin Herbert (10) passing during an NFL football game against the Las Vegas Raiders on November 30, 2025 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nRight now, Herbert looks like the ultimate regular-season quarterback — capable of piling up yards, highlight throws, and analytics love — but not capable of carrying a team when the pressure peaks. That’s not a Hall of Fame résumé. That’s a cautionary one.\n\nThe organization seems to understand something has to change, which brings us to the offensive coordinator search. Herbert, notably, will have no say in it.\n\n“I have no questions about his ability as a player,” Harbaugh said. “He’s not looking to be the GM or the coach. It’s our responsibility to put him in the best position possible.”\n\nThat’s fine. Quarterbacks don’t need personnel power. But at some point, “putting him in position” has to stop being the shield. The coaching staff did enough. The roster did enough. Herbert didn’t.\n\nSo now the Chargers search for another “fix.” Marcus Brady has already interviewed. More candidates are coming. The net, as Harbaugh said, is wide. They want someone with a track record, vision, and proven success. They want a physical run game. A tough, smart offense. A “head coach of the offense.”\n\nAnd maybe they’ll find the right system. But systems don’t throw the ball. Quarterbacks do.\n\nIf Herbert truly is the quarterback Harbaugh believes he is, then it shouldn’t matter who the coordinator is when the season is on the line. Great quarterbacks overcome. Elite quarterbacks elevate. Championship quarterbacks don’t need everything perfect to deliver one playoff win.\n\nHerbert still hasn’t delivered one.\n\nThe Chargers will keep building. They’ll keep changing coordinators. They’ll keep promising progress. But unless Herbert proves he can be more than a regular-season star, the ending will remain the same.\n\nAnother January loss. Another fresh start. Another year further away from the championship Chargers fans have waited six decades to see.",

    "fullText": "According to On3’s Pete Nakos, Jordan Seaton is currently in Starkville to visit Mississippi State. Seaton is close with the Bulldogs’ offensive line coach, Phil Loadholt, from their time at Colorado. A huge development for head coach Jeff Lebby, hoping to get in the running for one of the best players in the NCAA transfer portal.\n\nLoadholt only spent one season in Boulder. Colorado hired him away from Oklahoma, where he was an offensive analyst on Brent Venables’ initial staff. Lebby was the offensive coordinator at the time, making the connection between the two. So when Lebby needed an OL coach at Mississippi State, Loadholt wound up being his guy.\n\nNow, the coaching duo is hoping the connection can pay dividends. The competition for Seaton is going to be a tough one. Nakos recently provided the latest on where things stand for the offensive tackle. Friday will bring another SEC trip for him, heading to the 40 Acres to see the Texas Longhorns.\n\nThe On3 Industry Transfer Portal Rankings have Seaton as a four-star prospect and No. 4 overall player to enter this cycle. No offensive tackle ranks above him, showing how highly thought of he is. Seaton is also the No. 1 player currently available in the portal.\n\nColorado got Seaton on campus ahead of the 2024 season, being a massive recruiting win for head coach Deion Sanders. He immediately slotted into the left tackle role, initially protecting quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Some positives came from Seaton’s true freshman campaign before really exploding in 2025. Quality performances earned him second-team All-Big 12.\n\nSeaton played high school football at Bradenton (FL) IMG Academy, where he was a Five-Star Plus+ prospect. He was the No. 18 overall recruit in the 2024 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies.",

    "title": "My Gripes with Prolog",
    "description": "It's not my favorite language",
    "fullText": "For the next release of Logic for Programmers, I'm finally adding the sections on Answer Set Programming and Logic Constraint Programming that I TODOd back in version 0.9. And this is making me re-experience some of my pain points with Prolog, which I will gripe about now. If you want to know more about why Prolog is cool instead, go here or here or here or here.\n\nISO \"strings\" are just atoms or lists of single-character atoms (or lists of integer character codes). The various implementations of Prolog add custom string operators but they are not cross compatible, so code written with strings in SWI-Prolog will not work in Scryer Prolog.\n\nCode logic is expressed entirely in rules, predicates which return true or false for certain values. For example if you wanted to get the length of a Prolog list, you write this:\n\nNow this is pretty cool in that it allows bidirectionality, or running predicates \"in reverse\". To generate lists of length 3, you can write length(L, 3). But it also means that if you want to get the length a list plus one, you can't do that in one expression, you have to write length(List, Out), X is Out+1.\n\nFor a while I thought no functions was necessary evil for bidirectionality, but then I discovered Picat has functions and works just fine. That by itself is a reason for me to prefer Picat for my LP needs.\n\n(Bidirectionality is a killer feature of Prolog, so it's a shame I so rarely run into situations that use it.)\n\nAside from atoms (abc) and numbers, there are two data types:\n\nThere's no proper key-value maps or even struct types. Again, this is something that individual distributions can fix (without cross compatibility), but these never feel integrated with the rest of the language.\n\ntrue and false aren't values, they're control flow statements. true is a noop and false says that the current search path is a dead end, so backtrack and start again. You can't explicitly store true and false as values, you have to implicitly have them in facts (passed(test) instead of test.passed? == true).\n\nThis hasn't made any tasks impossible, and I can usually find a workaround to whatever I want to do. But I do think it makes things more inconvenient! Sometimes I want to do something dumb like \"get all atoms that don't pass at least three of these rules\", and that'd be a lot easier if I could shove intermediate results into a sack of booleans.\n\n(This is called \"Negation as Failure\". I think this might be necessary to make Prolog a Turing complete general programming language. Picat fixes a lot of Prolog's gripes and still has negation as failure. ASP has regular negation but it's not Turing complete.)\n\nProlog finds solutions through depth first search, and a \"cut\" (!) symbol prevents backtracking past a certain point. This is necessary for optimization but can lead to invalid programs.\n\nYou're not supposed to use cuts if you can avoid it, so I pretended cuts didn't exist. Which is why I was surprised to find that conditionals are implemented with cuts. Because cuts are spooky dark magic conditionals sometimes conditionals work as I expect them to and sometimes leave out valid solutions and I have no idea how to tell which it'll be. Usually I find it safer to just avoid conditionals entirely, which means my code gets a lot longer and messier.\n\nThe original example in the last section was this:\n\nfoo(1, 2) returns true, so you'd expect f(A, B) to return A=1, B=2. But it returns false. Whereas this works as expected.\n\nI thought this was because \\+ was implemented with cuts, and the Clocksin book suggests it's call(P), !, fail, so this was my prime example about how cuts are confusing. But then I tried this:\n\nThere's no way to get that behavior with cuts! I don't think \\+ uses cuts at all! And now I have to figure out why \nfoo(A, B) doesn't returns results. Is it floundering? Is it because \\+ P only succeeds if P fails, and A = B always succeeds? A closed-world assumption? Something else?1\n\nSay I have a program like this:\n\nAnd I want to know all of the nodes that are parents of branches. The normal way to do this is with a query:\n\nThis is interactively making me query for every result. That's usually not what I want, I know the result of my query is finite and I want all of the results at once, so I can count or farble or whatever them. It took a while to figure out that the proper solution is bagof(Template, Goal, Bag), which will \"Unify Bag with the alternatives of Template\":\n\nWait crap that's still giving one result at a time, because N is a free variable in bagof so it backtracks over that. It surprises me but I guess it's good to have as an option. So how do I get all of the results at once?\n\nThe only difference is the N^Goal, which tells bagof to ignore and group the results of N. As far as I can tell, this is the only place the ISO standard uses ^ to mean anything besides exponentiation. Supposedly it's the existential quantifier? In general whenever I try to stray outside simpler use-cases, especially if I try to do things non-interactively, I run into trouble.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize the reason bagof \"works\" is because infix symbols are mapped to prefix compound terms, so that a^b is ^(a, b), and then different predicates can decide to do different things with ^(a, b).\n\nThis is also why you can't just write A = B+1: that unifies A with the compound term +(B, 1). A+1 = B+2 is false, as 1 \\= 2. You have to write A+1 is B+2, as is is the operator that converts +(B, 1) to a mathematical term.\n\n(And that fails because is isn't fully bidirectional. The lhs must be a single variable. You have to import clpfd and write A + 1 #= B + 2.)\n\nI don't like this, but I'm a hypocrite for saying that because I appreciate the idea and don't mind custom symbols in other languages. I guess what annoys me is there's no official definition of what ^(a, b) is, it's purely a convention. ISO Prolog uses -(a, b) (aka a-b) as a convention to mean \"pairs\", and the only way to realize that is to see that an awful lot of standard modules use that convention. But you can use -(a, b) to mean something else in your own code and nothing will warn you of the inconsistency.\n\nAnyway I griped about pairs so I can gripe about sort.\n\nAccording to an expert online this is because sort is supposed to return a sorted set, not a sorted list. If you want to preserve duplicates you're supposed to lift all of the values into -($key, $value) compound terms, then use keysort, then extract the values. And, since there's no functions, this process takes at least three lines. This is also how you're supposed to sort by a custom predicate, like \"the second value of a compound term\".\n\n(Most (but not all) distributions have a duplicate merge like msort. SWI-Prolog also has a sort by key but it removes duplicates.)\n\nI don't care if it makes fact parsing ambiguous, I just don't want \"reorder two lines\" to be a syntax error anymore\n\nI expect by this time tomorrow I'll have been Cunningham'd and there will be a 2000 word essay about how all of my gripes are either easily fixable by doing XYZ or how they are the best possible choice that Prolog could have made. I mean, even in writing this I found out some fixes to problems I had. Like I was going to gripe about how I can't run SWI-Prolog queries from the command line but, in doing do diligence finally finally figured it out:\n\nIt's pretty clunky but still better than the old process of having to enter an interactive session every time I wanted to validate a script change.\n\n(Also, answer set programming is pretty darn cool. Excited to write about it in the book!)\n\nA couple of people mentioned using dif/2 instead of \\+ A = B. Dif is great but usually I hit the negation footgun with things like \\+ foo(A, B), bar(B, C), baz(A, C), where dif/2 isn't applicable. ↩",

    "description": "Explore the inevitable shift from scripts to AI agents in coding. Discover insights on automation, tool access, and setting effective guardrails.",
    "fullText": "I’ve noticed a pattern in my coding life. It starts innocently enough. I sit down to write a simple Python script, maybe something to tidy up my Obsidian vault or a quick CLI tool to query an API. “Keep it simple,” I tell myself. “Just input, processing, output.”\n\nBut then, the inevitable thought creeps in: It would be cool if the model could decide which file to read based on the user’s question.\n\nTwo hours later, I’m not writing a script anymore. I’m writing a while loop. I’m defining a tools array. I’m parsing JSON outputs and handing them back to the model. I’m building memory context windows.\n\n(For those keeping track: my working definition of an “agent” is simple: a model running in a loop with access to tools. I explored this in depth in my Agentic Shift series, but that’s the core of it.)\n\nAs I sit here writing this in January of 2026, I realize that almost every AI project I worked on last year ultimately became an agent. It feels like a law of nature: Every AI project, given enough time, converges on becoming an agent. In this post, I want to share some of what I’ve learned, and the cases where you might skip the intermediate steps and jump straight to building an agent.\n\nThis isn’t just feature creep. It’s a fundamental shift in how we interact with software. We are moving past the era of “smart typewriters” and into the era of “digital interns.”\n\nTake Gemini Scribe, my plugin for Obsidian. When I started, it was a glorified chat window. You typed a prompt, it gave you text. Simple. But as I used it, the friction became obvious. If I wanted Scribe to use another note as context for a task, I had to take a specific action, usually creating a link to that note from the one I was working on, to make sure it was considered. I was managing the model’s context manually.\n\nI was the “glue” code. I was the context manager.\n\nThe moment I gave Scribe access to the read_file tool, the dynamic changed. Suddenly, I wasn’t micromanaging context; I was giving instructions. “Read the last three meeting notes and draft a summary.” That’s not a chat interaction; that’s a delegation. And to support delegation, the software had to become an agent, capable of planning, executing, and iterating.\n\nThe Gemini CLI followed a similar arc. There were many of us on the team experimenting with Gemini on the command line. I was working on iterative refinement, where the model would ask clarifying questions to create deeper artifacts. Others were building the first agentic loops, giving the model the ability to run shell commands.\n\nOnce we saw how much the model could do with even basic tools, we were hooked. Suddenly, it wasn’t just talking about code; it was writing and executing it. It could run tests, see the failure, edit the file, and run the tests again. It was eye-opening how much we could get done as a small team.\n\nBut with great power comes great anxiety. As I explored in my Agentic Shift post on building guardrails and later in my post about the Policy Engine, I found myself staring at a blinking cursor, terrified that my helpful assistant might accidentally rm -rf my project.\n\nThis is the hallmark of the agentic shift: you stop worrying about syntax errors and start worrying about judgment errors. We had to build a “sudoers” file for our AI, a permission system that distinguishes between “read-only exploration” and “destructive action.” You don’t build policy engines for scripts; you build them for agents.\n\nLast year, I learned to recognize a specific code smell: the AI classifier.\n\nIn my Podcast RAG project, I wanted users to search across both podcast descriptions and episode transcripts. Different databases, different queries. So I did what felt natural: I built a small classifier using Gemini Flash Lite. It would analyze the user’s question and decide: “Is this a description search or a transcript search?” Then it would call the appropriate function.\n\nIt worked. But something nagged at me. I had written a classifier to make a decision that a model is already good at making. Worse, the classifier was brittle. What if the user wanted both? What if their intent was ambiguous? I was encoding my assumptions about user behavior into branching logic, and those assumptions were going to be wrong eventually.\n\nThe fix was almost embarrassingly simple. I deleted the classifier and gave the agent two tools: search_descriptions and search_episodes. Now, when a user asks a question, the agent decides which tool (or tools) to use. It can search descriptions first, realize it needs more detail, and then dive into transcripts. It can do both in parallel. It makes the call in context, not based on my pre-programmed heuristics. (You can try it yourself at podcasts.hutchison.org.)\n\nI saw the same pattern in Gemini Scribe. Early versions had elaborate logic for context harvesting, code that tried to predict which notes the user would need based on their current document and conversation history. I was building a decision tree for context, and it was getting unwieldy.\n\nWhen I moved Scribe to a proper agentic architecture, most of that logic evaporated. The agent didn’t need me to pre-fetch context; it could use a read_file tool to grab what it needed, when it needed it. The complex anticipation logic was replaced by simple, reactive tool calls. The application got simpler and more capable at the same time.\n\nHere’s the heuristic I’ve landed on: If you’re writing if/else logic to decide what the AI should do, you might be building a classifier that wants to be an agent. Deconstruct those branches into tools, give the agent really good descriptions of what those tools can do, and then let the model choose its own adventure.\n\nYou might be thinking: “What about routing queries to different models? Surely a classifier makes sense there.” I’m not so sure anymore. Even model routing starts to look like an orchestration problem, and a lightweight orchestrator with tools for accessing different models gives you the same flexibility without the brittleness. The question isn’t whether an agent can make the decision better than your code. It’s whether the agent, with access to the actual data in the moment, can make a decision at least as good as what you’re trying to predict when you’re writing the code. The agent has context you don’t have at development time.\n\nWe are transitioning from Human-in-the-Loop (where we manually approve every step) to Human-on-the-Loop (where we set the goals and guardrails, but let the system drive).\n\nThis shift is driven by a simple desire: we want partners, not just tools. As I wrote back in April about waiting for a true AI coding partner, a tool requires your constant attention. A hammer does nothing unless you swing it. But an agent? An agent can work while you sleep.\n\nThis freedom comes with a new responsibility: clarity. If your agent is going to work overnight, you need to make sure it’s working on something productive. You need to be precise about the goal, explicit about the boundaries, and thoughtful about what happens when things go wrong. Without the right guardrails, an agent can get stuck waiting for your input, and you’ll lose that time. Or worse, it can get sidetracked and spend hours on something that wasn’t what you intended.\n\nThe goal isn’t to remove the human entirely. It’s to move us from the execution layer to the supervision layer. We set the destination and the boundaries; the agent figures out the route. But we have to set those boundaries well.\n\nHere’s the counterintuitive thing: building an agent isn’t always harder than building a script. Yes, you have to think about loops, tool definitions, and context window management. But as my classifier example showed, an agentic architecture can actually delete complexity. All that brittle branching logic, all those edge cases I was trying to anticipate: gone. Replaced by a model that can reason about what it needs in the moment.\n\nThe real complexity isn’t in the code; it’s in the trust. You have to get comfortable with a system that makes decisions you didn’t explicitly program. That’s a different kind of engineering challenge, less about syntax, more about guardrails and judgment.\n\nBut the payoff is a system that grows with you. A script does exactly what you wrote it to do, forever. An agent does what you ask it to do, and sometimes finds better ways to do it than you’d considered.\n\nSo, if you find yourself staring at your “simple script” and wondering if you should give it a tools definition… just give in. You’re building an agent. It’s inevitable. You might as well enjoy the company.",

    "fullText": "As a viral app sparks debate about solo living in China, new Census Bureau data shows that the share of one-person households in the US is reaching record highs.\n\nA new app has risen to the top of China’s iPhone App Store charts — one markedly more macabre than the messaging platforms and AI assistants that typically lead the ranking.\n\nOn Monday, media outlets reported that the viral app Sile Me (which roughly translates from Mandarin as a very literal “Are You Dead?”) had become the country’s most popular paid Apple App Store download.\n\nLaunched in mid-2025 and costing a mere 8 yuan ($1.15) to buy, Sile Me offers just one function: a large button that users can press to confirm that they are, in fact, alive. If they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app will reach out to an appointed emergency contact.\n\nWhile the app’s simplicity is reminiscent of some earlier patrons of the App Store, its sudden popularity is putting the spotlight on the growing cohort of solo dwellers in the Eastern nation.\n\nResearch suggests that there could be as many as 200 million one-person households in China by 2030 — and while a rapidly aging population explains some of that rise, younger people now also appear to be embracing living alone.\n\nIn America, it’s no different. Data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey for 2025 reveals that the number of one-person households in the US is edging close to a record 40 million, with the share of American households made up of just one person hitting an all-time high of 29%.\n\nThis includes an estimated ~1.3 million extra one-person households in 2025 compared with the prior year, though the Bureau noted that this may be reflective of both demographic changes and methodological updates. Even so, the significant rise over the last decade indicates a broader societal shift that’s been playing out around the globe.\n\nAs noted by The Economist in November, the share of people living alone has increased in 26 out of 30 rich countries since 2010.\n\nMarriage rates are continuing to plummet in the US, as well as in China and many other developed nations, which has coincided with rising incomes and some heated online discourse about traditional relationships. And, like China, the surge in solo dwellings is also being driven at the older end of the demographic spectrum: America’s population aged 65 and older, statistically the most likely cohort to live alone, is expected to keep booming.",

    "description": "When analyzing early universe data, the Standard Model of Cosmology suggests that the universe should be more “clumpy” that what we observe.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nWhen analyzing early universe data, the Standard Model of Cosmology suggests that the universe should be more “clumpy” that what we observe.\n\nA new study suggests that interactions between the two most elusive particle types in the universe—dark matter and neutrinos—could help explain this discrepancy.\n\nThe study analyzes cosmic shear data from both the early and late universe, and theorizes that such interactions have a strength of about 10-4.\n\nTwo of the most enigmatic particles in the known universe are dark matter (theorized to make up most of the matter in the cosmos) and neutrinos (weakling-interacting, nearly massless subatomic particles that can’t be observed directly). Because these two particles are decidedly anti-social, it makes sense that the ΛCDM model—our current best guess of what makes the universe tick—suggests that they certainly don’t interact with each other. Right?\n\nWell, not so fast. A new study (from scientists at the University of Sheffield, the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Poland, and the University of Science and Technology of China) analyzes cosmic shear data from the early- and late-universe sources, and suggests that interactions between these two particles could explain why the cosmos isn’t as clumpy as we’d expect from early-universe data alone. The results were published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\n“Observations of the modern universe indicate that matter is slightly less clumped than expected, pointing to a mild mismatch between early- and late-time measurements,” Eleonora Di Valentino, a co-author of the study from the University of Sheffield, said in a press statement. “Our study shows that interactions between dark matter and neutrinos could help explain this difference, offering new insight into how structure formed in the universe.”\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, scientists first needed loads of data from both eras of the universe—and luckily, they had a lot to choose from. For the early universe, they relied on observations from the terrestrial Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the space-based Planck Telescope. For observations of more recent times, the team relied on the massive trove of data from the Dark Energy Camera on the Victor M. Blanco Telescope in Chile and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\n\nWith data in hand, Valentino and her team focused on a phenomenon called cosmic shear, which describes the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing caused by the universe’s structure. According to Universe Today, if neutrinos and dark matter influence each other, this interaction would impact the structure of galactic clusters and voids in a similar manner to what we observe today. By the team’s observations, dark matter and neutrinos react with a strength of about 10-4.\n\nWhile a compelling piece of evidence, the scientists note that the statistical significance of this finding rests at three sigma (3σ), which is not enough to be considered definitive proof (that typically requires a statistical significance of 5σ). Valentino also clarifies that this discovery doesn’t necessarily upend the ΛCDM model, but may indicate that it is complete.\n\nHopefully, future cosmic microwave background experiments, more precise weak lensing surveys, and ever more accurate data from new telescopes could further confirm (or deny) this big “woah, if true” moment.\n\n“It would not only shed new light on a persistent mismatch between different cosmological probes, but also provide particle physicists with a concrete direction,” William Giarè, a co-author of the study from the University of Sheffield, said in a press statement, “indicating which properties to look for in laboratory experiments to help finally unmask the true nature of dark matter.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Tyrannosaurus rex lived longer and took more time to reach its maximum size than previously thought, according to a new study.\n\nScientists have long counted annual growth rings in fossilized Tyrannosaurus rex leg bones to calculate both their age at death and how fast they grew to adult size. These dinosaurs typically stopped growing around 25 years old and lived to around 30, research has shown.\n\nHowever, a new study published in the journal PeerJ on Wednesday details how a team of scientists used polarized light to reveal previously unseen growth rings from 17 individual specimens. T. rex wouldn’t have reached its maximum size of around 8 tons until it was 35 to 40 years old, the analysis found.\n\nUnlike tree growth rings, dinosaur growth rings only capture the final 10 to 20 years of an individual’s life.\n\nBut because the specimens ranged in age from early juveniles to adults, researchers were able to put together a picture of their growth using a new statistical approach that combines records from individuals of different ages.\n\nDrawing on the largest dataset ever put together for Tyrannosaurus rex, researchers were able to reconstruct their growth history year by year and found that the dinosaurs grew much more slowly than previously thought.\n\n“Instead of growing quickly, T. rex spent most of its life in the mid-body size range rather than achieving a total body length of 40 feet quickly,” lead study author Holly Woodward, a professor of anatomy at Oklahoma State University, told CNN on Thursday.\n\n“Additionally, we found that growth ring spacing varied within individuals, with some years showing substantial growth and others very little,” she said. “This variability suggests that growth was flexible and likely influenced by resource availability and possibly environmental conditions.”\n\nThe findings help scientists understand more about the king of the dinosaurs and its role in the world tens of millions of years ago, Woodward said.\n\n“I think the study helps reveal why T. rex was so successful as an apex carnivore — that by growing slowly over a longer period of time, T. rex occupied many food niches throughout its life, eventually becoming large enough that it was only really competing with other T. rex for resources,” she said.\n\nIn addition, differences in the growth curves of some of the specimens involved in the study add to the scientific debate as to whether what paleontologists believed to be a single species named Tyrannosaurus rex is in fact a complex that includes other species or subspecies.\n\nFor example, a study published in October uncovered evidence that a specimen thought to have belonged to a teenage T. rex was actually from a different species known as Nanotyrannus.\n\nWhile the growth rates examined in this study cannot definitively prove the existence of separate species, “the evidence suggests that intriguing possibility, among other possible explanations,” according to the researchers’ statement.\n\nThe new study’s findings mesh well with the recent work on Nanotyrannus, said Steve Brusatte, a professor of paleontology and evolution at Scotland’s University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“This is good, provocative work that also suggests that there was more variation among T. rex than we used to think, and that some fossils that have long been called T. rex may actually belong to different species,” Brusatte said.\n\nThe discovery of a new type of dinosaur growth ring could also have wider implications for paleontologists investigating dinosaur growth rates.\n\n“Interpreting multiple closely spaced growth marks is tricky,” said study coauthor Nathan Myhrvold, a mathematician and paleobiologist at invention and investment business Intellectual Ventures, in the statement.\n\n“We found strong evidence that the protocols typically used in growth studies may need to be revised,” he said.\n\n Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.",

    "description": "Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979",
    "fullText": "PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979 Islamic Revolution still afflicts the leading opposition factions.\n\nThat split, between monarchists supporting Reza Pahlavi, son of the ousted shah, and a more organised leftist group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq, has played out online ​and even in angry arguments in street protests in Europe and North America.\n\nHow far either faction has support inside Iran, or might be able to shape events there in the future, is hard to gauge, ‌though analysts and diplomats have for decades regarded both as being far more popular among emigres than inside the country.\n\nMany other Iranians outside Iran are also deeply sceptical of both the monarchists and MEK, but have no organised opposition network comparable to those factions.\n\nThe lack of a universally ‌accepted opposition movement or figurehead has complicated international approaches towards the deadly unrest sweeping Iran, with U.S. President Donald Trump questioning Pahlavi's support even as he weighed air strikes.\n\n\"What's problematic is there has been no inclusive organisation that has been built that can bring together Iranians of all walks of life: religious, ethnic, socioeconomic,\" said Sanam Vakil, Middle East head at the Chatham House think tank in London.\n\nDuring the past two weeks of violent unrest, videos in Iranian cities have shown some demonstrators chanting in support of the ousted monarchy and the late shah's son, who has encouraged the protests.\n\nShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled into exile in 1979 and died a year later, was a close Western ally who harked back to ⁠ancient Persian heritage in framing his rule as a national leader and moderniser. But ‌he resisted democratic change as increasing economic disparities destabilised the country.\n\nHis 65-year-old son, who is based in the U.S., says he wants democracy for Iran and has not specified any role he would seek if the current system collapsed. His supporters run one of the main Persian-language satellite television stations broadcasting into Iran.\n\nReza Pahlavi's supporters in the West have pointed to ‍the videos of protesters in Iran chanting his name as evidence his popularity is growing, saying he is the only figure able to unite the country if the Islamic Republic implodes.\n\nAmong foreign officials and diplomats following Iran there are mixed views as to whether the latest protests show that Pahlavi's role is growing.\n\nA Western diplomat said Pahlavi's name may have been used by street protesters because there were few other recognisable opposition figures, but that there was no sign he commanded the sort of domestic support that could make ​him a future leader.\n\nA European official said a big spike in protest numbers after a call for street action by foreign opponents of the government, including Pahlavi, showed his stature may be broader than was previously understood.\n\nHowever, ‌any role he played would need to be in the context of a wider democratic movement, said Iranian analyst and former diplomat Mehrdad Khonsari. \"You need a coalition of people who believe in democratic values in order to sort of lighten the weight and give greater confidence to people,\" he said.\n\nThe idea that Pahlavi may have popularity inside Iran is not shared by the MEK, whose supporters regard the pre-revolution monarchy as comparable to the current Shi'ite theocracy.\n\nIts supporters online often use the slogan \"No Monarchy, No Supreme Leader\".\n\nThe MEK is a movement fusing leftist and Islamist ideas whose cadres carried out bombings inside Iran before and after the revolution, even as mass support was growing for rival factions on the streets.\n\nThe ruling clerics banished the MEK in 1981 and it established military bases in Iraq that it used to launch attacks on Iranian troops during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, something many Iranians remember with fury.\n\nIt was listed as a terrorist ⁠organisation in the United States until 2012, but some Western politicians have voiced backing for the group including former U.S. secretary of ​state Mike Pompeo.\n\nHowever, the European official described the MEK as widely despised inside Iran, partly because of its conduct during the Iran-Iraq war, ​and analysts say it has had little presence in the country for decades.\n\nThe group's official leader Massoud Rajavi has not been seen since 2002 and is widely thought to be dead, though the MEK has not acknowledged that. His wife, Maryam Rajavi, runs the organisation and its affiliate, the National Council for Resistance in Iran.\n\nGroup officials say their supporters are widespread in Iran and ‍active, though there has been no public sign of support ⁠for the MEK seen by Reuters during the protests.\n\nMonarchists - along with many other Iranian dissidents and Iran's current rulers - regard the MEK with intense suspicion, pointing to its history of violence and enforcement of ideological purity within its ranks.\n\nFor many Iranians, the arguments between the Islamic Republic's theocratic establishment, monarchists voicing nostalgia for the 1970s, and a revolutionary group that lost out in the early 1980s may seem outdated.\n\nEven as monarchist and ⁠MEK supporters remained prominent among émigrés and as the same faces revolved through the upper echelons of the Islamic Republic, Iran's population was doubling in size and growing more urban and educated.\n\nMost major political movements inside Iran after 1979 sought to either bolster or reform the Islamic ‌Republic, rather than sweep it away entirely, until successive waves of protest in recent years demanding more comprehensive change.\n\n\"Iranians inside Iran are, I think, not just looking to the diaspora for their future,\" ‌said Vakil.",

    "description": "Gen X is heading toward retirement with hidden challenges. Discover three sneaky problems that could derail your plans and how to avoid them.",
    "fullText": "Gen X is inching closer to retirement, but many of the challenges waiting ahead are the same ones baby boomers are struggling with right now.\n\nSome of these issues can disrupt even the most carefully built retirement plan. If you’re part of Gen X, make sure you’re aware of these retirement problems so that you have time to adjust and avoid the financial surprises many Boomers are seeing.\n\nMany Boomers assumed they would downsize, cash out some equity and move into a smaller place during retirement. In reality, a lot of them are stuck in houses that are either too expensive to maintain or too large for their current lifestyle.\n\nThe main reason for this is that home prices have gone up so much that selling your home and buying something smaller may not even be worth the effort. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the median sales price of houses sold for the United States is now around $410,000, $100,000 higher than five years ago. Even condos and townhomes in many cities now cost more than what Boomers paid for their original homes. High mortgage rates are also discouraging people from moving because they do not want to trade a low rate for a higher one in retirement.\n\nGen X could face the same situation. You may have a good amount of home equity on paper, but that doesn’t guarantee you can convert it into a more affordable living arrangement. If your future home budget is based on selling and moving, you may want to create a backup plan that accounts for staying put longer than expected.\n\nBe Aware: 64% of Americans Aren’t Prepared For Retirement — and 48% Don’t Care\n\nRead Next: 5 Clever Ways Retirees Are Earning Up To $1K per Month From Home\n\nBoomers have already learned that Social Security is not the reliable base income many assume it is. Even though the program is still paying benefits, current retirees are facing two issues that Gen X should prepare for.\n\nThe first is that Social Security can be smaller than expected. The Social Security Board of Trustees projects program cost to rise by 2035 so that taxes will be enough to pay for only 75% of scheduled benefits. In other words, you should plan for benefits that may replace a lower percentage of pre-retirement income.\n\nThe second issue is taxes. Many retirees are surprised to learn that up to 85% of their Social Security benefits can be taxable depending on their total income, per the Social Security Administration (SSA). These tax thresholds have not been adjusted for inflation in decades, so more people are pushed into higher tax liability without realizing it.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump suffered a stroke several months ago and has kept it from the public, a prominent medical expert has suggested.\n\nProfessor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine made the bombshell claim about the 79-year-old president’s health while laying out “lines of evidence supportive” that have also been reported on by the Daily Beast over the past year.\n\n“I think his stroke was on the left side of the brain, which controls the right side of the body,” Davidson told biographer Sidney Blumenthal and Princeton historian Sean Wilentz on their podcast, The Court of History.\n\n“I think the stroke was six months ago or more, earlier in 2025,” he continued. “There are videos of him shuffling his feet, which is not what we’d seen previously when he was striding on the golf course. We’ve seen him holding his right hand cradled in his left. Earlier in 2025, he was garbling words, which he hadn’t done before and which he’s improved upon more recently.”\n\nDavidson also pointed to what he described as “marked episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness,” known medically as hypersomnolence, which he said is common among stroke patients. Trump is now routinely appearing to nod off in public appearances such as White House events.\n\nHe further suggested that footage showing Trump gingerly descending the steps of Air Force One while gripping the banister with his left hand, despite the president being right-handed, is “consistent with having had a stroke on the left side of the brain.”\n\nDavidson did not specify what sort of stroke he believes the president may have suffered, but said if he is correct with his claim then it “looks like he’s had significant recovery.”\n\nSpeculation about the mental and physical decline of Trump, who is on track to become the oldest president in U.S. history, has circulated for months.\n\nThe president has frequently appeared in public with large, visible bruises on his hands, which he desperately attempts to conceal with blotches of makeup.\n\nTrump has also taken steps to hide from public view his swollen cankles, a symptom of the medical condition chronic venous insufficiency, which the White House admitted the president had in July 2024.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised after Trump appeared at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks with his face drooping to one side. Multiple social media users speculated at the time that the appearance could be a sign of a stroke, though no diagnosis has been confirmed.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Wall Street Journal published this month, Trump acknowledged several health issues and treatments, including briefly wearing compression socks to help manage swelling in his legs.\n\nHe also made the startling admission that he takes more aspirin than his doctors recommend for “cardiac prevention.” Trump and the White House have repeatedly attributed the unsightly bruising on the 79-year-old’s hands to his daily aspirin use, combined with his frequently shaking people’s hands.\n\nElsewhere during his podcast appearance, Davidson suggested that Trump’s erratic and aggressive governing style during his second term could also be consistent with post-stroke behavioral changes.\n\n“It’s a very serious, concerning, life-threatening, upsetting, scary event, and people react in different ways,” Davidson said. “Some people respond with humility and gratitude. Others become euphoric—‘I was at the cliff of death, and now I’m back.’ And some think, ‘That was my chance to die, and I didn’t—so now I’m going to do everything I wanted to do, because the next one may be fatal.’”\n\nIn response, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Daily Beast: “As the President’s physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, has made clear time and again—and as the American people see with their own eyes every single day—President Trump remains in excellent overall health.”\n\n“President Trump’s relentless work ethic, unmatched energy, and historic accessibility stand in sharp contrast to what we saw during the past four years when the failing legacy media intentionally covered up Joe Biden’s serious mental and physical decline from the American people,” she continued. “Pushing these fake and desperate narratives now about President Trump is why Americans’ trust in the media just fell to a new all-time low.”",

    "fullText": "With over 170 million Americans facing below average temperatures, even colder air may be on the horizon thanks to the displacement of the polar vortex that will lock in a deep winter feel and park the coldest air over North America.\n\nIn the coming weeks, cold air will continue for parts of the U.S. thanks to the influence of the polar vortex.\n\nTypically, a strong polar vortex keeps the coldest air locked up around the North and South poles. When it weakens, it allows for cold air intrusions into the lower latitudes, opening a window for cold air to flow into the U.s., but what we’re facing now is different.\n\nIn this case, the polar vortex has been stretched or elongated rather than significantly weakened. When this happens, the coldest air is not able to consolidate in one region and is instead dispersed across a large area, leading to prolonged cold spells.\n\nIn the current circumstances, the displaced polar vortex will keep the coldest air over North America and bring prolonged periods of cold to the eastern portion of the Lower 48 through the end of January.\n\nLooking ahead, forecast guidance suggests the two lobes of the polar vortex may begin to recombine, strengthening the overall vortex again, acting like a focused reservoir of Arctic air.\n\nIn the event the entire core of the polar vortex shifts away from the pole and toward Canada, it would create a \"direct channel\" for frigid temperatures to flow into the U.S.\n\nThe first of this vortex-influenced cold will initially build across Canada late next week before driving south into the U.S. as we head into the final week of January.\n\nIt remains to be seen just how cold it will get, but the greatest probability of frigid air will be from the northern Rockies, through the northern Plains, Great Lakes and into the Northeast.\n\nSo bundle up, the heart of winter lies ahead, and it looks like this year, it may be especially frigid.\n\nThe stretched displacement of the polar vortex that could produce prolonged cold spells for millions of Americans across the Northern Tier comes as a deep winter chill settles in the East.\n\nAfter a quick January thaw for most across the Lower 48, winter will roar back with temperatures crashing well below average from the Upper Midwest and stretching into Florida this week.\n\nFriday morning may be the coldest of the week, with freezing temperatures reaching as far south as Jacksonville and Daytona Beach. To provide perspective on the intensity of the cold, Tallahassee is forecast to be 26 degrees; meanwhile, Denver—located 1,630 miles away and at an elevation 5,155 feet higher—is forecast to be 27 degrees that same morning.\n\nSnow Could Show In The South As Chances Increase Ahead Of The Weekend\n\nThis first shot of arctic air will plunge over 170 million Americans into below-average temperatures Thuesday. While parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast will feel the chill, the most significant shift will occur across the Southeast; cities like Nashville, Atlanta and Louisville may not even reach 40 degrees for an afternoon high.\n\nOn Saturday, a second shot of bitter cold air will hit the Upper Midwest, where high temperatures may struggle to reach 10 degrees.\n\nThis deep freeze will persist through the weekend and into early next week. To make matters worse, wind chills are expected to plunge to -10 to -20 degrees in Minneapolis and Chicago on Sunday.\n\nNfl Rams Vs. Bears Divisional Round Playoff Could Break Record For One Of Coldest Games\n\nWith the NFL Divisional Playoff game in Chicago on Sunday night, fans could witness one of the coldest Bears playoff games on record.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "Jan 15 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications said on Thursday it is offering a $20 credit to hundreds of thousands of customers impacted by ​its 10-hour outage on Wednesday that the U.S. wireless company said ‌was caused by a software issue.\n\nVerizon said the issue primarily impacted customers in the northeast, southern California, ‌Texas and pockets of the Midwest and was not the result of a cyberattack. The issue was resolved around 10 p.m. EST (0300 GMT) Wednesday.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said it would review the outage.\n\n\"We did not meet the standard of excellence our ⁠customers expect and that we ‌expect of ourselves. To help provide some relief to those affected, we are giving customers a $20 account credit,\" Verizon said.\n\nThe company ‍added \"if customers are still experiencing issues, we encourage them to restart their devices to reconnect to the network.\"\n\nThe outage prompted several major cities to advise residents to use other carriers ​to call emergency services. Downdetector, which aggregates data on service outages, said ‌late Wednesday it had received 2.2 million reports over the last 24 hours related to the Verizon service disruption.\n\nFederal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr told Reuters after a congressional hearing that the agency would review the issue \"and take appropriate action\".\n\nNew York City told residents the outage could affect some users trying to call 911 ⁠for emergency help. \"Call using a device from ​another carrier, a landline, or go to a ​police/fire station to report emergencies,\" the city said on X.\n\nThe District of Columbia issued a similar alert. The warnings were dropped after ‍operations resumed normally.\n\nVerizon faced a ⁠nationwide wireless outage in late 2024 that affected more than 100,000 users at its peak. The outage drew the FCC's attention after several services ⁠were affected and iPhone users were stuck in \"SOS\" mode. Many users on Wednesday reported the same ‌issue about phones in \"SOS\" mode.",

The group came together in an effort to address Trump’s pursuit of Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“I would not normally like to say these words, but I will say them: We are very strong,” Motzfeldt said. “We are doing our utmost. But the last days, naturally… Oh, I am getting very emotional. I am overwhelmed.”\n\nShe added: “The last days have been tough. Our preparations and the increasing pressure that has been intense. But I want to say, we are strong in the government. The work is to ensure the the Greenlandic people in our country can feel safe and live securely. We are using all our strength to achieve this as we continue the work.”\n\nOver the past year, Trump hasn’t let up on his desire to take over Greenland. During an interview with press, per Politico, Rasmussen said he and his team hit a roadblock with Trump over the region.\n\n“We didn’t manage to change the American position,” Rasmussen said Wednesday. “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland.

    "fullText": "Graduate international student enrollment at US universities is down after years of steady growth amid the Trump administration's immigration clampdown.\n\nThere were almost 10,000 fewer foreign students signing at the graduate level in fall 2025, a 5.9% decline from the year before, according to data released by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. Meanwhile, a 3.2% increase at the undergraduate level added 5,000 students to the numbers coming from abroad, the data showed.\n\nCombined, international and domestic enrollments showed a slight increase. In total, there were 19.4 million postsecondary enrollments — 16.2 million undergraduate, and 3.2 million graduates — up from the 19.2 million enrollments the year before.\n\nInternational students are typically welcomed by school administrators because they often pay the full fees. However, in a post on X this week, the State Department said it had revoked 8,000 student visas as part of its mission to \"keep America safe.\"\n\n🚨BREAKING: The State Department has now revoked over 100,000 visas, including some 8,000 student visas and 2,500 specialized visas for individuals who had encounters with U.S. law enforcement for criminal activity.\n\nWe will continue to deport these thugs to keep America safe. pic.twitter.com/wuHVltw1bV\n\nThe State Department reopened student visa applications in June last year, having temporarily halted them. It said applicants would have to set their social media accounts to public — a requirement extended to others applying for visas just before Christmas.\n\nThe National Student Clearinghouse Research Center did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, I moved from Kentucky to Ireland for love. Many people think my life is a dream, but I struggle with challenges like homesickness.",
    "fullText": "Whenever I tell someone back home in Kentucky that my husband is Irish and we live in Ireland, they get this dreamy look in their eyes.\n\nI can imagine what they probably think my life looks like: living in a thatched-roof cottage, strolling among gently rolling hills dotted with fluffy sheep, and spending cozy, firelit evenings in a pub overflowing with laughter and live traditional music.\n\nThose things do exist in Ireland — but, as I found out, not to the extent Hollywood and the tourism industry would have you believe.\n\nI was in my mid-20s when I arrived in Cork City for a dream internship at a local restaurant. I couldn't believe my luck.\n\nLocals and newcomers alike always say that Cork, Ireland's second-largest city, is really just a village. Its community vibe, bustling markets, and diverse cultural activities quickly made me feel like I belonged.\n\nOnly weeks in, I caught myself basking in a rare day of sunshine, wistfully thinking, \"This is somewhere I could see myself living five years from now.\" Famous last words.\n\nAbout three months after moving to Ireland, I met Frank through friends I'd made. One glimpse was all it took.\n\nSeveral weeks later, we were dating. When my internship ended and I returned to Kentucky, I was eager to get back to Frank as soon as I could — so, we started discussing marriage.\n\nMy parents weren't thrilled to hear I was getting married and moving 4,000 miles away. My mom warned me the distance would be incredibly hard, but I was convinced any homesickness would be manageable and everything would work out … like in a fairy tale.\n\nOnce I was permanently settled in Ireland, the dreamy veneer of this lifestyle began to fade away. Things that hadn't bothered me before suddenly felt like big problems.\n\nFor one thing, finding a nice and affordable rental was more challenging than I expected.\n\nI envisioned our first home together having a patio garden for slow mornings sipping coffee, a guest bedroom for when family came to visit, and a cozy kitchen for gathering with friends.\n\nAfter spending weeks viewing the limited options within our budget — all musty, cramped, soulless one-bedrooms — we finally got lucky and found a small but comfortable place we could afford.\n\nStill, though, I had to give up on my dreams of a garden and spare bedroom, and invest in a good dehumidifier to handle the unrelenting dampness caused by Ireland's frequent rain.\n\nAs my mom predicted, though, the greatest challenge thus far has been dealing with homesickness.\n\nThis was especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, just over five years into my marriage. I'll never forget the video chat with my parents in March 2020, when we discussed whether I should go home or remain in Ireland.\n\nAs a US citizen, I could board one of the few North American flights, but Frank couldn't. It was a moment I never thought I'd face — choosing between my husband and my home.\n\nIn deciding the safest option was to stay put, I didn't know how many months or even years would pass before I'd see my family in Kentucky again.\n\nWhen I see people back home's faces light up after I tell them I live in Ireland, I always want to say it's not as magical as they might imagine … but then, I think of my husband and the life we share.\n\nTogether we've been able to run a business from home, develop our creative interests (acting for him, writing for me), live in a walkable city without a car, enjoy access to amazing local food, and take a cheap flight to Europe whenever wanderlust strikes.\n\nIt's true that Ireland isn't as dreamy in reality as it is on screen, and my homesickness means half of my heart is always somewhere else.\n\nI followed my heart to Ireland, though, and I've chosen to stay because of the love I found here. Perhaps my life is its own type of fairy tale after all.",

The categories were measured using 50 metrics, including the number of attractions, public school quality, housing affordability, unemployment rate, crime and safety, and more.\n\nWalletHub found that the best states to raise a family are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, regions that are home to many of the country's top educational institutions, have healthy job markets, and offer a high quality of life.\n\nSurprisingly, not a single Southern state made the list, despite the region attracting thousands of movers with its strong job growth and relatively affordable housing.

    "description": "My festive spin on the Aperol spritz is a crowd-pleaser with or without alcohol. Here's the four-ingredient recipe that a dietitian reviewed for me.",
    "fullText": "For many, the Aperol spritz is reserved for daylight-saving time, falling into the same bucket as loose linen shirts and beach days.\n\nOnce the clock falls back, the quintessential, three-ingredient summer cocktail — made with Aperol, Prosecco, and sparkling water — seems to go into hibernation.\n\nI, however, don't fall into that camp. The bright-orange, refreshing spritz is one of my year-round orders. I've found that with a couple of easy tweaks, an Aperol-based drink can actually be very versatile.\n\nMy version of the classic recipe has become one of my favorite drinks in the fall and winter months, regardless of whether I'm on the sun-drenched Côte d'Azur or in my native drizzly England.\n\nI've seen various versions of this cocktail online with slightly different ratios and ingredients. In my experience, you don't need to be too strict about it.\n\nYou can alter the quantities based on your tastes and preferences, but for one simple spritz, I use the following:\n\nPour the above ingredients into a glass with plenty of ice, and you're done. There's no shaking required.\n\nAlthough the above measurements yield one cocktail, I've scaled the recipe and served it in a large punch bowl or pitcher when hosting friends at my home.\n\nYou can make it stronger by adding a splash of alcoholic spiced apple cider or go for a heavier Aperol pour.\n\nJust keep in mind that Aperol is a distilled spirit with 11% alcohol content, so even when it's diluted, it's worth being mindful of how many units you're having.\n\nTo garnish the drink, you can use a sprig of rosemary, cinnamon sticks, dehydrated orange slices, or cranberries. One of my favorite touches is making big ice cubes with an apple slice or a star anise inside.\n\nAnd if you really love a sweet cocktail, coat the rim of your glass with a bit of cinnamon sugar.\n\nI ran my recipe by dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who said that my festive spritz is a \"lighter, more hydrating option\" than many other popular holiday cocktails.\n\nAs your glass empties, top up your drink with soda water, which Ludlam-Raine explains counteracts alcohol's diuretic effect and helps keep you from getting dehydrated.\n\nIf you're not drinking at all, swap the Aperol for Crodini or Wilfred's aperitif and the prosecco for a nonalcoholic sparkling wine to create a tasty mocktail.\n\n\"I would totally drink this myself and recommend it to my patients,\" Ludlam-Raine told me. \"It's a great way of having a tasty drink without feeling like you're missing out if you're not having alcohol.\"\n\nAlthough Ludlam-Raine said that fruit juice adds flavor and antioxidants, you should be mindful of how much you use to keep your sugar intake in check.\n\nThis is especially true if you're having multiple … which I always am because this drink is that delicious.",

    "fullText": "It's almost time to return to the ton, gentle reader.\n\nThe first episodes of season four of \"Bridgerton\" will drop on Netflix on January 29, with part two premiering on February 26. The season focuses on Benedict Bridgerton's love story with Sophie Baek. Luke Thompson will reprise his role as Benedict, while Yerin Ha will play Sophie.\n\nAhead of the show's Netflix release, the cast of \"Bridgerton\" gathered at the Palais Brongniart in Paris on Wednesday to celebrate the season's world premiere in red-carpet style.\n\nSome stars wore high-fashion outfits that nodded to their characters, while others missed the mark with lackluster suits or dresses that didn't fit the event.\n\nTake a look at some of the best and worst outfits from the \"Bridgerton\" season four premiere.\n\nHa, who stars as Sophie Baek in season four of \"Bridgerton,\" arrived at the premiere in an ice-blue gown designed by Prada.\n\nThe dress had a bedazzled halter neckline that matched the beading on a cutout on the bodice. The floor-length skirt featured two large pleats that cascaded into a train that trailed behind Ha as she walked the red carpet. Sparkly jewelry completed Ha's glamorous look.\n\nThe ensemble looked like a modern take on Cinderella's iconic blue dress. It was fitting since Julia Quinn's \"An Offer from a Gentleman,\" upon which season four is based, is a retelling of \"Cinderella.\"\n\nAs he stepped into the leading role of \"Bridgerton,\" Thompson wore an all-black ensemble. He paired a black suit with a black button-down shirt, a black tie, and a black flower on his lapel. The only color on the look was a sparkly tie clip.\n\nThe look was stylish, but the black pieces blended so well that it became difficult to distinguish the different elements, particularly the flower and pin.\n\nSome pops of color may have made the outfit stand out more.\n\nJessie, who plays Eloise Bridgerton, chose an oversize suit for the event.\n\nThe double-breasted jacket and pants were black, but they were adorned with an assortment of flowers in various colors to give the suit some pop. Jessie paired the suit with a slicked-back hairstyle and several earrings and rings, adding a high-fashion edge.\n\nRosheuvel, who plays Queen Charlotte, wore a floor-length sweater dress from Sonney for the premiere. The burnt orange look had a slight sparkle and a cowl neckline, and Rosheuvel wore a matching coat and color-coordinated earrings.\n\nThe outfit was stylish, but it didn't feel formal enough for the red-carpet event. It may have worked better for a daytime press event, or Rosheuvel could have chosen a dress with the same silhouette in a different fabric.\n\nAlli, who plays Lord John Stirling on \"Bridgerton,\" wore an oversize black suit to the event.\n\nHe paired the suit with a white shirt, which he wore without a tie, and it peeked out from the cuffs of his jacket. He added a small silver brooch to his lapel for a chic addition.\n\nThe modern take on a tuxedo exuded high fashion.\n\nDodd, who married John Stirling as Francesca Bridgerton in season three of \"Bridgerton,\" chose a black Giambattista Valli Paris set for the premiere.\n\nThe top was a black, cropped shrug with a V-neck and a button closure that revealed her midriff. It was paired with a low-waisted, calf-length skirt that poofed out around her, giving it a ball-gown feel despite the modern silhouette.\n\nBlack heels and silver jewelry tied Dodd's stylish look together.\n\nThe Lady Danbury actor's custom Torlowei gown for the premiere was beautiful, with a high neckline and black lace detailing.\n\nHowever, Andoh's open-toed black shoes didn't quite match the dress, as they seemed less formal than the gown. Different shoes and statement earrings could have better accented the ensemble.\n\nLeung, who will make her debut on \"Bridgerton\" as Lady Araminta Gun, walked the red carpet in a black Toni Maticevski dress.\n\nIts strapless, scooped neckline formed points for a touch of drama before flowing into a corset bodice. The skirt was structured, poofing out around her waist in a dramatic ball-gown shape before flowing back into a pencil skirt. The center of the dress was made of ribbed fabric, adding dimension.\n\nChopard jewelry and strappy Christian Louboutin heels completed the look. Between the classic detailing, modern flair, and dark color, the dress was the perfect red-carpet companion for the wicked stepmother role Leung will play on the show.\n\nRhimes looked every bit the queen of the ton in the silver gown she wore to the premiere, which was styled by Dana Asher Levine.\n\nThe strapless gown had a slight point in the center of the straight neckline, and it cinched at Rhimes' waist with a belt. The entire gown was covered in silver and bronze sequins arranged in vertical strips, shimmering as Rhimes walked.\n\nThe pièce de résistance was a cape that coordinated with the gown. It sat on Rhimes' shoulder and flowed to the floor, giving the look a regal edge that was more than fitting for the occasion.",

In court filings, Amazon said the financing would \"saddle\" Saks with \"billions of dollars of obligation for no material benefit\" and improperly use the value of Saks Global's flagship entities to prop up other debtors at the expense of their creditors, including Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal judge overseeing Saks' bankruptcy case granted the company approval at a court hearing on Wednesday to tap an initial round of its financing.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Business Insider on Thursday, and representatives for Saks declined to comment.",

    "description": "The advice from five legal experts boiled down to a blunt workplace reality: employees should watch their mouth if they want to keep their job.",
    "fullText": "Hours after President Donald Trump toured a Ford pickup truck assembly plant, the big news story wasn't about manufacturing jobs or the economy. It was about a Ford worker who heckled him and was later suspended.\n\nThe incident raised questions about the limits of free speech in the workplace — and when companies can discipline workers for political protest.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke to five experts, including four employment lawyers and an HR executive, to find out.\n\nTheir conclusion was blunt: an employee's words can quickly become fireable offenses.\n\nAll four lawyers said workers retain legal free speech rights under the Constitution, but those rights rarely protect speech in their workplace.\n\n\"With very few exceptions, employees in the private sector don't have free speech rights at work,\" Mark Kluger, a co-founding partner at New Jersey-based law firm Kluger Healey, told Business Insider.\n\nJessica Childress, a managing attorney at Washington, DC-based The Childress Firm, said workers often confuse who the First Amendment actually applies to. The best way to think about it, she said, is to divide government action from a private company's authority.\n\n\"The First Amendment's right to freedom of speech only applies to government actors, not private employers, such as Ford,\" she said. \"A private company can — with certain exceptions — limit what their employees say.\"\n\nThat distinction has played out in real-world cases before.\n\nIn 2017, Juli Briskman, a former marketing analyst for a government contractor, was fired from her job after professional photographers caught her giving Trump's motorcade the middle finger.\n\nEven though her action happened outside of the office, her lawsuit against her employer was tossed.\n\n\"Employers are legally allowed to regulate behavior that disrupts the workplace,\" said Jared Pope, an employment law attorney and CEO at Work Shield. \"That is why most organizations apply their codes of conduct consistently, even when speech happens off the clock or references public figures.\"\n\nStill, lawyers said workers generally have more protection if they express their political belief off-the-clock.\n\n\"If you are so inclined to protest, do it off-duty, off-premises, and off-company networks,\" Eric Kingsley, a partner at Kingsley Szamet Employment Lawyers, told Business Insider. \"An employer has the ability to discipline an employee for speech in matters of politics when it becomes misconduct.\"\n\nEach lawyer we talked to said that Ford was well within its rights to suspend the employee, T.J. Sabula.\n\nIn fact, some said the automaker may have displayed restraint by not outright firing the factory employee after the decision.\n\n\"It implies Ford is buying time,\" Kingsley added. \"Suspending the employee gives them a chance to investigate and make a decision that may not be as rash as laying off an employee.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Auto Workers, the union representing the workers in Sabula's plant, confirmed his suspension. Sabula, who has said he doesn't regret heckling Trump and is set to receive over $800,000 in crowdfunded support, has not responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLaura Dickerson, a vice president for the UAW, said the union was reviewing Ford's actions and said workers \"should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States.\"\n\nThe union also said Sabula \"believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"\n\nFord declined to comment on the suspension, saying it was \"a personnel matter.\"\n\n\"Ford is navigating a high-profile, politically charged moment,\" Lauren Winans, CEO of the HR consulting firm Next Level Benefits, said. \"The union's involvement likely influenced Ford's decision to suspend (not fire), because unilateral termination could lead to grievances and arbitration.\"\n\nFor workers wondering if they can get fired for speaking their mind at work, Kluger made it clear the answer is yes.\n\n\"Try telling your boss what you really think of them and see how long you remain employed,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon didn't have much trouble telling Warren Buffett he'd hired one of his top lieutenants.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO said that he called Buffett after hiring Todd Combs in December, who will lead a new $10 billion group at the bank and act as a special advisor to Dimon.\n\n\"It's a free country, and people make their own decisions,\" Dimon said in an interview at the Chamber of Commerce on Thursday. \"I did call Warren. He probably wouldn't have preferred it, but he said, 'if he's going anywhere, at least he's going to you.'\"\n\nCombs had been at Berkshire since 2010, where he served as CEO of Berkshire-owned Geico and as one of Buffett's two investment managers. In a press release, Buffett said that Combs \"has resigned to accept an interesting and important job at JPMorgan,\" and that the bank made \"a good decision.\"\n\nIn his own press release about the hire, Dimon called Combs, a former member of JPMorgan's board, \"one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known.\" Dimon has praised Buffett time and again over the years, saying that he \"represents everything that is good about American capitalism and America itself\" after the 95-year-old announced he would step down as Berkshire's CEO. Business Insider contacted Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan for comment.\n\nDimon, 69, addressed questions of his own future as a corporate leader during Thursday's interview. When asked whether he wants to stay in the job his characteristic five more years, Dimon said yes, \"at least.\"\n\n\"I love what I do. It's up to the board how long I do it. As long as I have the energy and the spit in the eye and the fire in the gut, yeah, I want to do it,\" he said.\n\nAnd he said he has absolutely no interest in becoming the Fed Chair: \"Absolutely, positively, no chance, no way, no how for any reason.\" (Dimon reiterated the importance of the central bank's independence in the interview, which has come into question in recent days given the Justice Department's investigation. He said that President Donald Trump also thinks we need an independent board.)\n\nIf a president offered him the job of Treasury Secretary, however, Dimon said he would \"consider it.\" He'd need to understand \"what they want and how they want to operate\" before making a decision.\n\nFor now, though, Dimon said he's happy to be his own boss.",

    "description": "Did you really violate the platform's policies, or is it a phishing scheme?",
    "fullText": "If you receive a warning on a LinkedIn post that your account has been restricted, don't engage with it. Scammers are using LinkedIn branding in official-looking \"reply\" comments to spread phishing links intended to harvest users' login credentials.\n\nAs reported by BleepingComputer, this impersonation campaign relies on fake company pages and LinkedIn's official link shortener to trick users into \"verifying\" their identities on a domain run by threat actors. Here's what to look for.\n\nScammers are replying to posts on LinkedIn with messages claiming that users have in some way violated the platform's policies. The comments include a link, which users are urged to click to prevent their accounts from being further restricted or suspended.\n\nIn some cases, the link's preview text states \"We take steps to protect your account when we detect signs of potential unauthorized access. This may include logins from unfamiliar locations or...\" which may convince users to overlook the link itself, which clearly does not lead to a page on a valid LinkedIn domain. In others, the scammers have further masked the phishing site using LinkedIn's official URL shortener, lnkd.in, which is even less likely to raise suspicion, especially if the link preview doesn't generate on certain devices.\n\nIf you click through the link, you'll land on a phishing page that uses LinkedIn branding and contains more information about the supposed account restriction with a button to \"Verify your identity.\" That leads to another page that closely spoofs LinkedIn's standard sign-in interface and is designed to steal your credentials.\n\nThe reply comments themselves utilize LinkedIn's logo and branding and are connected to company pages with variations on the platform's name—\"Linked Very,\" for example. These are obviously fake at first glance, as they don't have any of the robust content (such as posts, employees, or followers) you'd expect from the real LinkedIn. But users could feasibly follow the phishing link without further investigation into the commenter.\n\nAs always, any urgent message or comment about your account security or status, no matter how official-sounding, should raise red flags. A second look at these replies make it clear that they are not from the real LinkedIn, which won't send communication about account or policy violations in a public manner nor urge you to click links in comments or private messages.",

    "fullText": "Users of Supernatural got an unpleasant surprise this week: Meta has pulled the plug on its flagship virtual reality fitness app. Citing \"organizational changes,\" Meta says it will no longer release new content or update features for Supernatural.\n\nThe app is not shutting down completely however. Subscribers can still access Supernatural's existing library of Beat Saber-workouts, and Meta says it will maintain the platform and Facebook page, but no new workouts, features, or other content is planned.\n\nBoth users and critics have nearly universally praised Supernatural—CNet scored it 9 out of 10, it won both Fast Company's Best App award in 2020 and a Webby in 2023, and boasted celebrity tie-ins with Jane Fonda and Bon Jovi. Meta doesn't publish subscriber numbers for Supernatural, but there are over 110,000 members of Supernatural's Facebook community. Not enough, apparently, to warrant keeping the app going.\n\nIn 2021, Meta spent an estimated $400 million to purchase Within, Supernatural's developer, even battling the FTC to make the deal, and the app was a heavily promoted part of the company's overall \"Metaverse\" strategy.\n\nThe shuttering of Supernatural is part of a larger shift at Meta. This week, the company laid off 1,500 people—about 10% of the staff—from Reality Labs, Meta's hardware and virtual reality division. “We said last month that we were shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward Wearables. This is part of that effort,” a Meta spokesman told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAlong with cuts at Supernatural, Meta is closing three studios behind some of the most prominent, high-end VR games: Armature, who brought Resident Evil 4 to VR, Sanzaru, the studio behind Asgard’s Wrath, and Twisted Pixel, creators of Deadpool VR.",

It might not be as much as some of us think the company should offer, but it's something. And if the $20 isn't a comfort, the fact that the outage is over should be—even if you needed to restart your phone this morning to implement the fix.\n\nThe weirdest part of the whole affair was that Verizon didn't initially offer any details about what caused the outage. The company posted throughout yesterday, issuing updates and responding to angry customers, but never shedding light on why their network was down for so many customers. Finally, a day and a half after the outages kicked off, the company has an answer, albeit a partial one.\n\nAccording to a statement Verizon sent to our sister site Mashable, the cause of the outage was simply a problem with the company's software. \"This was a software issue and we are conducting a full review of what happened,\" the company said. \"As of now, there is no indication that this was a cyber security issue.\" That last bit is important, as some customers took the outage as evidence of some type of cyber attack. While those worries seem to be unfounded, considering the current state of the world, I understand those fears.\n\nStill, while it's nice to have some sort of explanation, I could do with more details. This wasn't a minor, temporary outage affecting only a limited number of users; customers across the country couldn't connect to Verizon for most of the day. Software issues happen, but they usually don't take down one of the three major carriers in the United States.",

I need to sit down with my family and decide.\n\n\"After a stressful summer, I'm just trying to enjoy being a part of it and being a Liverpool player.\n\n\"I wanted to qualify for the World Cup and thankfully we've managed to do that. I need to see what myself and my family wants going forward.\"\n\nRobertson, who signed for Liverpool for £8m from Hull City in 2017 during Jurgen Klopp's reign, has played 362 times for the Reds but has started just four Premier League games this season.\n\nHungary international Milos Kerkez, 22, has been Liverpool's first-choice left-back since making the move from Bournemouth for £40m last summer.\n\nAsked if the amount of game time he gets between now and the end of the season would have an impact on his future, Robertson said: \"I can focus on the last eight and a half years. I think Jurgen Klopp left me out for one game and I was raging. So I'm a player who wants to play.\n\n\"I've played through injuries. I've played when I'm not 100% fit. I've played when I've only been 50/40/30% fit for this club and my country. I always want to be on the grass and playing and obviously now that's not happening, so that's what is different.\n\n\"I have a different role here this season which I'm getting enjoyment out of, but at the end of the day, footballers want to play and if anyone is sat happy on the bench, then they don't belong at any football club.\"",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh's cricketers have begun a boycott of all forms of cricket in response to comments made by a national cricket board director, which have led to his removal.\n\nBoth of Thursday's matches in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) have been postponed, while the national side's participation in February's T20 World Cup is in doubt.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced it has removed M Nazmul Islam from his position as chair of its financial committee after he suggested players should shoulder the financial burden if Bangladesh were to withdraw from the World Cup.\n\nThe comments came amid political tensions between Bangladesh and host nation India.\n\nThe BCB has formally requested that all Bangladesh's matches are staged elsewhere in order to participate in the tournament.\n\nAll of Pakistan's fixtures are to be played in Sri Lanka, with the BCB seeking a similar arrangement.\n\nAsked about the financial implications should Bangladesh be required to withdraw, Islam said: \"Why [would there be]? Are we asking them for the crores and crores of taka [Bangladesh's currency] that we are spending on them? Answer me first.\n\n\"We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything in different places. Have we got any international awards? What have we done at any level?\n\n\"Let us now ask them for the money back after every time they couldn't play. Give us back. Why should there even be a question of compensating the players?\"\n\nOne Bangladeshi crore is equivalent to just over £60,000.\n\nIslam's comments drew a swift response from Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB).\n\n\"The remark made by the BCB director has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly and it's not acceptable,\" Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.\n\n\"We demand his resignation. If he doesn't resign before tomorrow's match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow.\"\n\nNeither side arrived for Thursday's match between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express, with that fixture and the later match between Rajshahi Warriors and Sylhet Titans confirmed as being postponed.\n\nThe BCB, in removing Islam from his position, stated: \"Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president has decided to release Mr Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.\n\n\"The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority. The board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt said all cricketers should \"display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game\" and called for BPL matches to be played as planned.\n\nBangladesh's T20 World Cup campaign is scheduled to begin on Saturday, 7 February against West Indies in Kolkata, with a match against England on Saturday, 14 February due to take place at the same venue, Eden Gardens.\n\nThe Bangladesh Premier League has six group games left to play, leading into a four-match knockout stage, finishing with a final in Dhaka on Friday, 23 January.",

I will say it now,\" England's Littler replied when asked if he will still be playing into his 70s.\n\n\"He's just class and I wonder when is he going to retire? He still goes very strong in the practice room as well.\"\n\nLittler faces Wales' Gerwyn Price, who saw off Motomu Sakai 6-3, in the last eight. Price was last year's runner-up in Bahrain after beating Littler in the semi-finals.\n\nSecond seed Luke Humphries is also through after a 6-0 win against Abdulla Saeed, while World Championship runner-up Gian van Veen defeated Man Lok Leung 6-2.\n\nMichael van Gerwen is set to play defending champion Stephen Bunting in the quarter-finals.",

    "fullText": "There were no tears from Mohamed Salah when the final whistle went in Tangier as Egypt fell at the semi-final hurdle. Just a little smile, but one no doubt hiding immense disappointment.\n\nYet again, his Egypt side had failed at the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) and, yet again, they had fallen against Senegal and Sadio Mane - Salah's ex-Liverpool team-mate.\n\nAcross the five games Salah started in Morocco, the 33-year-old scored four goals as he carried his nation to the semi-finals.\n\nAfter their quarter-final win against the Ivory Coast, Salah described it as the \"best camp\" he'd ever had.\n\n\"We're all close, we love each other, we hang out together, the humour is unbelievable, and we work hard both on and off the pitch,\" said Salah.\n\nSalah is expected to return to Merseyside, where uncertainty still remains over his future, following Saturday's third-place play-off against Nigeria in Casablanca.\n\nSalah last started a game for Liverpool on 26 November in the Champions League against PSV, which Arne Slot's side lost 4-1.\n\nSince then, Liverpool are 11 games unbeaten (W6, D5), though the performances have been questionable - with Slot admitting last week he did not \"completely disagree\" with suggestions the Reds' football has been \"dull and boring\" during that period.\n\nIt is also over a month since Salah gave an explosive mixed zone interview at Leeds, where he accused Liverpool of \"throwing him under the bus\" after he was benched for three games in a row, and claimed his relationship with Slot had broken down.\n\nHe was subsequently left out for Liverpool's trip to Inter Milan but was not fined and returned to the squad against Brighton a few days later, coming off the bench in the first half when Joe Gomez was injured.\n\nSalah got an assist in the second half and was given a warm reception by the Anfield crowd, before staying to applaud all four sides of the ground after full-time as they serenaded their \"Egyptian King\" with his familiar song. That was his last appearance before joining up with his national team.\n\nSlot insisted after that there was \"no issue to resolve\", with Curtis Jones also revealing Salah had apologised to his team-mates for the fallout from his interview.\n\nIn his absence Liverpool have not lost a game, but they have lost striker Alexander Isak to a lower leg injury until at least March, while defender Conor Bradley has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury.",

You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.\nIn a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal and reported on by Medical Xpress, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects \"excessive gaming\" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that \"high gamers\"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.",

    "fullText": "Dan Troccoli, a public middle school teacher, says everyone should start “emulating” Minneapolis’s resistance to ICE and the Trump regime.\n\nThousands of ICE thugs roam the streets, attacking schools, smashing car windows, shooting residents, and “visiting” activists in their homes. Now President Donald Trump is threatening to impose the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to flood the city with troops. Welcome to Minneapolis during the Trump regime.\n\nWhat is happening in Minneapolis is a fascist shit show, but there is also grassroots resistance. The oppression is all over the news, but the stories of ordinary people fighting back need to be told, too. Dan Troccoli, a public school teacher at Justice Page Middle School and union activist, says that the battle for Minneapolis is not a one-sided rout by ICE—if it was, there would not be these threats to impose martial law.\n\n“Many people around the city have been going around patrolling and keeping an eye on these agents,” he told me. “There are estimates as high as 10,000 people that have been involved in the city in these efforts in the last six weeks. Given the legacy of the uprisings after [the 2020 police murder of] George Floyd, people in the city have been activated for years now. I would argue we were Trump’s target for that reason, but it’s not going exactly like they planned, and people need to know that.”\n\nOne example of things “not going exactly like they planned” happened at Roosevelt High School. Only hours after the ICE killing of Renee Good, ICE tried to storm the gates of Roosevelt, when a person they were pursuing ran onto school grounds just as students were heading home. Instead of retreating, ICE assaulted and gassed students and educators. But their attack was met. “In our union, in the Minneapolis Federation of Educators, there has been now, for about a year and a half, a group of educators calling themselves the Deportation Defense Group,” Trocolli explained. “So at Roosevelt, they were ready, and we had a network of people ready to go on this, and we have been doing training around how to be an observer, how to go on patrol, what are the most risky times for students to be dropped off or picked up, and how can we do mutual aid for families who can’t even pick up their kids. So the staff members at Roosevelt were outside of the building ready to ID ICE and physically get in between them and their students.”\n\nBut ICE aggressively pushed forward and then struck and sprayed chemical agents on students and staff. After all of that, ICE arrested one educator, who was then let go hours after the union’s lawyers were on the scene.\n\nThe Minneapolis teachers’ unions (there are two) have been front and center in this fight: opening up their halls for meetings every night, partnering with parent organizations, and holding training sessions.\n\n“This past weekend,” Troccoli recalled, “we had a training at one of our high schools, and there were something like 300 parents and staff mixed together, working together to try and organize in their buildings. At recent meetings of this same network of Unionists in MFE, there have been something like 60 to 70 percent of schools represented. And I would imagine it’s much higher now since Renee’s murder, with more buildings getting activated, involved, mostly out of fear and concern for their students’ safety.”\n\nTroccoli stressed that the union’s leadership and active response to the crisis comes from having a unique union president: Marcia Howard. Howard taught at Roosevelt for 20 years. When George Floyd was murdered, she, still a teacher, “was the coordinator, and hub of George Floyd Square.”\n\nHoward took the entire year off then to do this work, turning George Floyd Square into a kind of autonomous zone, and both teachers’ unions made sure she was paid during this time. This drew her closer to the union. Howard, with grassroots encouragement, ran for union vice president and president. “She’s just been a fiery and amazing leader for our union,” Troccoli said, “especially in terms of trying to marry union struggles with other social justice struggles in the city.”\n\nIn the face of this resistance, ICE is upping its oppression. Agents are showing up at the homes of people who follow ICE in their cars even at a safe distance are—no matter their citizenship. Troccoli also said that when these ICE-watchers leave their cars, phones in hand, to document their violence, they have been hit, without warning, with mace, pepper balls, and “nonlethal” bullet rounds.\n\nAnd yet ICE violence has yielded not compliance and pacification but even more resistance. Troccoli said, “A number of unions in the city are now committing to a day-long strike on January 23.” This call already includes the backings of some of the biggest unions in the city including, according to PayDay Report, The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1005, SEIU Local 26, UNITE HERE Local 17, CWA Local 7250, and St. Paul Federation of Educators Local 28, with more coming. “We’re not sure exactly what’s going to happen that day yet,” Troccoli said. “But it’s happening.\n\nAs far as what people can do Troccoli told me that social media support definitely keeps spirits up but “in addition to appreciation, we want emulation. We need that out there in the streets in every city”",

    "fullText": "We can turn the tide against Trump—but only with mass action and courageous leadership.\n\nShortly after dropping her 6-year-old son off at school, Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.\n\nRepublican leaders attempted to smear Good as a “domestic terrorist” and claim that Ross acted in “self-defense.” But the incident was caught on video, and we all saw it: an ICE agent murdering a 37-year-old mother. Good was also a US citizen, the demographic that ICE is claiming to protect.\n\nICE’s purpose in Minnesota has been to sow chaos and terror, with a focus in Minneapolis, one of the most diverse areas in the state. Many residents feel like they’re living under occupation. ICE agents are snatching residents from bus stops. Black and brown US citizens are carrying their passports everywhere to keep from being kidnapped by federal agents. Businesses are struggling as people are afraid to show up to work. Schools are on lockdown as ICE shows up to harass and assault students and educators. And now ICE has shot and killed a neighbor.\n\nWhile the violence of occupation is not the standard in Minneapolis, these recent events feel all too familiar. Good’s murder occurred just six blocks from where Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd. A badge does not give you a license to kill with impunity. We did not quietly accept the murder of George Floyd in 2020, and we will not accept the murder of Renee Good now.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has outrageously claimed that ICE is helping to keep people safe. What’s become blatantly clear is that ICE is the biggest threat to our community’s safety. That’s why the first demand from Minneapolis residents has been for ICE to leave.\n\nThousands of residents, including Good, have been organizing to protect our neighbors. Delivering groceries to families, so no one is abducted while trying to feed their loved ones. Walking kids to schools so families aren’t torn apart on the way home. Distributing whistles, so we can alert our neighbors when ICE is on our streets. These actions aren’t always visible, but they are helping to keep families together.\n\nAs a local elected official, I am working with my colleagues to push our governor to take action to keep families in their homes by instituting an eviction moratorium. Governor Tim Walz can show the rest of the nation that Democrats can resist Trump and protect residents targeted by the administration’s cruel policies. Hundreds of families are unable to safely go to work, and shouldn’t have to choose between keeping a roof over their heads and risking being permanently separated from their loved ones.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty announced Friday that they are conducting an independent investigation into the killing of Good, a crucial step as we cannot trust Trump’s agencies to conduct a fair arrest, investigation, or trial.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\nBut to truly put an end to ICE and the rising tide of fascism under Trump, the Democratic Party must take immediate and bold action for the following:\n\nWinning these demands require more than just voting. We need national-level labor organizing for strikes and shutdowns to interrupt the economy and force a change of course until we can all live free from the fear of being kidnapped or shot by armed agents. The ICE Out of Minnesota Economic Blackout planned for January 23 is a great start.\n\nBecause while the eyes of the world have once again turned to Minneapolis after a man with a badge killed one of our neighbors, this is a national problem.\n\nLess than 48 hours after an ICE agent killed Good, federal agents shot two people in Portland. They’ve already targeted Los Angeles, Chicago, and New Orleans. It could be your city next. As long as ICE exists, nobody is safe—not even a 37-year-old mom and US citizen. It’s going to take all of us doing our parts to end this violence.\n\nThis moment will go down in history, but we have a choice about how. If we do nothing, this will mark the beginning of a period where federal agents can kill us with impunity.\n\nBut if we act, we can make this the moment that finally turned the tide against rising fascism and ended Trump’s attacks on our communities. The time for mass action is now—let’s make this the last life stolen by ICE.",
