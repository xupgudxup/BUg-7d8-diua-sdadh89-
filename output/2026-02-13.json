Those players are: Matt Milano (11M), Joey Bosa (7.2M), Connor McGovern (4.8M), AJ Epenesa (2.9M), and DaQuan Jones (3.7M).\n\nDue to cap hit and the need to free up money, the front office and coaching staff may also soon examine what to do or rework in the contracts like those of Curtis Samuel, Dawson Knox, Ty Johnson, Taron Johnson, and Tyler Bass.\n\nIn the meantime, per the NFL transaction wire, Buffalo also made their first signings of the offseason, inking QB Shane Buechele and WR Jalen Virgil on free agent contracts. As neither player was currently under contract to any other team, they were free to sign with any club before the March 11 league year begins.\n\nWith a new coaching staff and coordinators in all three phases, there may be some additional personnel changes on defense as well, with new DC Jim Leonard's 3-4 concepts, in particular. This is another area the team may look at.\n\nWith new Bills DC Jim Leonhard likely to implement some 3-4 principles, here's a look at the salary cap impact of moving top-paid defenders through cuts and trades should the new staff feel that is necessary.\n\nSome contracts are more tradable than I would've thought. https://t.co/QnZzAzrssE pic.twitter.com/KmQh1QNoYZ\n\n— Nick Veronica (@NickVeronica) February 9, 2026\n\nSome other important dates coming up this offseason will include the February 17th-March 3rd window to use franchise tags, the February 23rd-March 2nd NFL Combine, the March 9th-11th beginning of the \"legal tampering\" window in free agency, the March 11th 4 PM beginning of free agency, and the April 23rd-25th NFL Draft.\n\nGM and President of Football Operations Brandon Beane and company will get to work on improving and strengthening the roster, which may also include more focus on doing so via trade(s) and the Draft, as the free agent market is notably a shallower talent pool this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bills Wire: NFL AFC Buffalo Bills Football Josh Allen Brandon Beane offseason",

    "description": "What if the greatest players in Detroit Lions history lined up together in their prime? Stafford under center, Sanders in the backfield, Megatron outside and Sewell in the trenches — this is the ultimate all-time Lions offense, built across generations.",
    "fullText": "Have you ever wondered what the greatest Detroit Lions team ever assembled would look like?\n\nImagine Matthew Stafford dropping back behind an elite offensive line, handing the ball off to Barry Sanders or Jahmyr Gibbs, and throwing to Calvin Johnson and Amon-Ra St. Brown. It is a blend of eras — championship grit from the 1950s, star power from the 1990s and record-breaking production from today.\n\nThis is Part I of a two-part series constructing the greatest Lions team of all time. We begin with the offense.\n\nDespite never winning a playoff game in Detroit, Stafford stands as the greatest quarterback in franchise history.\n\nStafford’s résumé extends beyond his Lions tenure. A Super Bowl champion and league MVP, he ranks eighth all-time in passing yards and seventh in passing touchdowns. His arm talent, toughness and late-game heroics defined an era of Lions football. While Jared Goff delivered playoff victories and a Super Bowl appearance, Stafford’s career production and hardware ultimately give him the edge.\n\nAt his peak, Stafford was capable of carrying an offense. In an all-time lineup loaded with weapons, his skill set would flourish even more.\n\nRunning Backs: Barry Sanders and Jahmyr Gibbs\n\nRather than stacking the field with three wide receivers, this all-time offense leans into Detroit’s historic strength — dynamic running backs.\n\nBarry Sanders is a lock. Sanders ranks fourth all-time in rushing yards despite playing only nine seasons. He never rushed for fewer than 1,300 yards in a season and remains widely regarded as the greatest running back in NFL history. His vision, balance and elusiveness are unmatched.\n\nPairing Sanders with Jahmyr Gibbs creates a nightmare for defenses. Gibbs, still early in his career, has already established himself as one of the league’s most explosive offensive players. He broke Sanders’ franchise record for most touchdowns before turning 24, reaching 48 total touchdowns. Though he has yet to earn First-Team All-Pro honors, his trajectory suggests it is only a matter of time.\n\nTogether, Sanders and Gibbs would form one of the most electrifying backfields imaginable.\n\nWide Receivers: Calvin Johnson and Amon-Ra St. Brown\n\nFew franchises can match the star power of this duo.\n\nCalvin Johnson, known simply as “Megatron,” was a true unicorn. He recorded 329 receiving yards in a single game, the second-most in NFL history, and set the single-season receiving yardage record with 1,964 yards in 2012, surpassing Jerry Rice. Johnson led the league in receiving yards twice and earned three First-Team All-Pro selections. His size, speed and red-zone dominance made him nearly unguardable.\n\nOn the opposite side is Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has been one of the most productive receivers in football over the past three seasons, including playoffs:\n\n• 4,590 receiving yards (second in the NFL)\n\n• 34 receiving touchdowns (first)\n\nSt. Brown has earned two First-Team All-Pro honors and one Second-Team selection, cementing himself among the league’s elite. His route running, toughness and reliability would complement Johnson’s vertical dominance perfectly.\n\nCharlie Sanders remains the gold standard at tight end in franchise history.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1977, Sanders earned seven Pro Bowl selections and three First-Team All-Pro honors. A Pro Football Hall of Famer, he totaled 336 receptions for 4,817 yards and 31 touchdowns. In an era not known for pass-heavy offenses, Sanders was one of the first truly dynamic receiving tight ends.\n\nHis presence would add versatility and balance to this all-time offense.\n\nOffensive Line: Lou Creekmur, John Gordy, Frank Ragnow, Larry Glover, Penei Sewell\n\nChampionship offenses begin in the trenches, and this group blends historic greatness with modern dominance. Combined, these five linemen account for 16 All-Pro selections and 22 Pro Bowl appearances.\n\nLou Creekmur anchors the unit. A six-time First-Team All-Pro and eight-time Pro Bowler, he was a cornerstone of Detroit’s 1950s championship teams and is widely considered the greatest offensive lineman in franchise history.\n\nJohn Gordy, a four-time First-Team All-Pro and six-time Pro Bowler, was a dominant guard during the Lions’ last championship era. His consistency and accolades cement his legacy.\n\nFrank Ragnow brings modern excellence to the center position. A four-time Pro Bowler and three-time Second-Team All-Pro, he has been one of the league’s top centers during the Dan Campbell era.\n\nLarry Glover, a three-time Pro Bowler, provides steady veteran presence from the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThen there is Penei Sewell. A four-time Pro Bowler and three-time First-Team All-Pro from 2023 to 2025, Sewell has emerged as one of the NFL’s premier tackles. Still early in his career, he is already on a Hall of Fame trajectory.\n\nThis all-time Lions offense blends eras, styles and philosophies. It has explosiveness in the backfield, dominance on the outside and power in the trenches.\n\nIn Part II, we will assemble the defense — and see if it can match the firepower of this historic offense.",

    "fullText": "New York Jets fans have come to terms with the fact that Sam Darnold was better off elsewhere. The former No. 3 overall selection has done a fantastic job reviving his career since leaving the Jets. All of Darnold's hard work culminated in winning Super Bowl LX with the Seattle Seahawks this past weekend.\n\nDarnold has kept it classy at every turn when discussing his tumultuous tenure with the Jets during Super Bowl media week. The Seahawks held their Super Bowl 60-winning parade in downtown Seattle on Wednesday.

Justin Fried of The Jet Press asked Darnold if he had a message to Jets fans who have continued to support him despite things not working out between player and franchise. Darnold provided the most heartwarming response imaginable.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Darnold started with. “I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise. The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.”\n\nCongratulations to Darnold on winning Super Bowl LX!\n\nI asked Sam Darnold if he had a message to #Jets fans who have continued to support him:\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise.”\n\n“The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.” pic.twitter.com/AtOsbghHJN\n\n— Justin Fried (@JustinTFried) February 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Sam Darnold had the most heartwarming message for Jets fans",

    "description": "The second-place finish in this year's women's halfpipe finals may wind up meaning more to Kim than her past golds.",
    "fullText": "Chloe Kim celebrates her second place in the women's halfpipe snowboarding final with the American flag at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics in Livigno, Italy, on February 12, 2026. Credit - Oliver Weiken—picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nYou’d be forgiven for disbelieving the smile on Chloe Kim’s face Thursday night in Livigno, Italy, after she finished with a silver medal in the women’s Olympic halfpipe snowboarding finals. Kim’s victories at the Olympics are typically inevitable. And after she finished first in qualifying earlier in the week, it seemed she had shaken the effects of the dislocated left shoulder she suffered back in early January. Winners refuse to accept second place, right?\n\nBut upon further review, Kim’s jubilant reception of the silver medal at the Milano Cortina Games made all kinds of sense. In fact, this hardware may wind up meaning more to her than the golds she took home from PyeongChang in 2018 and Beijing four years ago.\n\n“Absolutely,” says Kim. “I mean, a month ago, I wasn’t even sure if I would be here. I could get emotional thinking about it. I really worked hard to get here. So this metal means so much.”\n\nFollowing the competition, she walked down a snowy hill at the Livigno Snow Park halfpipe venue, hand-in-hand with her boyfriend, Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns, the NFL’s reigning defensive player of the year, who stood with Kim’s family and friends at the bottom of the halfpipe, snapping photos of Kim in action. “Exciting but terrifying,” Garrett said, about watching Kim contort her body in the air on a snowboard.\n\nShe’s got reason to be happy, personally and professionally. The new Olympic gold medalist, Goan Choi of South Korea, is now the youngest Olympic snowboard gold medalist, at 17 years, 101 days. Kim, who was also 17 when she won Olympic gold in PyeongChang, has become a mentor for Choi. If Kim walks away from snowboarding—“I’m aware that I can’t do this forever,” she says—she’d leave the sport in good hands.\n\n“She's my baby. I've known her since she was so little, and I'm so proud of her,” says Kim. “It means so much to me to know that I've inspired a whole new generation.”\n\nThe night began in typical Chloe Kim fashion. Seven of the 12 finalists fell in their first run in snowy conditions, which made landing tricks more of a challenge. But Kim made no such mistakes, and her run was visibly superior, even through the snowfall. Her score, at 88.00, led the competition.\n\nEach Olympic halfpipe finalist gets three runs, with the highest score the only one that counts. Could anyone surpass Kim in the final two runs? It had never happened before in the Games.\n\nKim had even held back in her first run. “I'll admit, I went pretty safe on it,” she says. “Didn't go as big as I was in practice, mainly because I was watching all these girls take slams, and I was like, let's just get to the bottom.”\n\nEntering her second run, Kim still held the lead. She tried to stretch her limits. “I wanted to try something I'd never done before,” says Kim. “I wanted to make history.” She fell.\n\nChoi had a scary-looking accident in her first run; she remained in the middle of the halfpipe for a few minutes while receiving medical attention, but was able to ride to the bottom of her own accord. Choi thought about dropping out of the event.\n\nInstead, she stunned the Livigno Snow Park by scoring a 90.25 on her final run, upping the evening’s ante. For the first time at the Olympics, Kim trailed. So she’d have to come through in the evening’s final attempt. “My coach said, you know, you could do your first run better, or you can go for it,” says Kim. “I wanted to go for it. Because that's what I do.”\n\nShe fell again, allowing Choi to claim the gold. “The snow really started to come down, the wall started to get a little sticky,” says Kim. “No excuses here. I should have made that mental note when I dropped in and felt it on my first hit. Yeah, I couldn't come through. But all good.”\n\nKim made a beeline for Choi to congratulate her. “She took a heavy slam, got back up and won the damn thing,” says Kim. “That is badass.” Choi is not only the youngest Olympic snowboarding champion: she’s also the youngest X-Games halfpipe titleist ever, winning the event in 2023 and unseating Kim for that distinction as well.\n\nKim fell short in her bid to be the first snowboarder to win three straight Olympic golds. “I don't know if there really was a weight on my shoulders,” she says. “I feel like every time I go into a competition, it's always like, ‘Oh, she can make history here. She could do this. She could do that.’ I'm just here to snowboard and whatever medal I get in doing so, great.”\n\nOn Kim’s itinerary upon her U.S. reentry: shoulder surgery. “I’m excited for it to not be popping out all the time,” she says. Kim believes the injury cost her the key pre-Games training time needed to execute a flawless plan.\n\nNot that she’s at all bummed about it.  “In my eyes, I’m a winner,” says Kim. “Because I was able to persevere and fight through.”\n\nWrite to Sean Gregory at sean.gregory@time.com.",

    "title": "This iconic golf backdrop plays essential Winter Olympics role",
    "description": "Several miles off the coast of Turnberry, Scotland, sits a barren island whose precious granite plays a key role in the Winter Olympics.",
    "fullText": "The original golf course at Trump Turnberry, on Scotland’s southwest coast, has some years on it: 125 to be exact. But that’s nothing compared to the age of one of the course’s famous neighbors: the uninhabited volcanic plug that stands sentinel in the Firth of Clyde about 10 miles off Turnberry’s shoreline.\n\nThe origins of that wind-battered granite dome, which rises more than 11 stories out of the sea and is visible from nearly every hole on Turnberry’s Aisla course, have been traced back 600 million years, to those lonely days when the continents were barren and the only signs of life came in the form of bacteria and eukaryotes.\n\nAnyone who’s played at Turnberry — or, for that matter, Royal Troon or Prestwick, about 25 miles up the coast — will be familiar with the island for the magnificent backdrop it provides. Same goes for golf-watchers who’ve tuned into any of the four Open Championships that have been conducted on the Aisla course since 1977, most recently in 2009 when Tom Watson nearly claimed the Claret Jug at 59 years young.\n\nThe Aisla Craig featured prominently in all of those broadcasts, just as Torrey Pines’ hang-gliders or Pebble Beach’s harbor seals do when the PGA Tour visits those storied venues. The rock is a staple of the Turnberry experience: an eroded magmatic pluton that not only inspires awe but also just so happens to play an essential role every four years in the Winter Olympic Games.\n\n***\n\nRicky English isn’t much of a golfer. “I’ve tried it before, it’s quite hard,” he told me earlier this week in a Scottish accent thicker than a pint of Belhaven Black. “It’s one of those games where one hole you can play like Seve Ballesteros, and then the next hole it’s in the woods and you’ve lost your ball.”\n\nBesides, English spends most of his days thinking about another sport: curling. If you’re even just a casual Olympics viewer — perhaps you’ve been following the action in Milan over the past week — you’re surely familiar with the pursuit, which has been awarding Olympic medals since the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. Curling, in the most basic terms, involves a “thrower” pushing a roughly 40-pound stone down a 150-foot-long sheet of ice, with the aim of stopping the stone as close as possible to the center of a target (aka “the house”) on the far end of the ice. Aiding in the process are two of the thrower’s teammates who flank the stone as it slides down the ice, using “brooms”, as needed, to reduce the ice’s friction.\n\nEnglish knows a thing or two about those stones because he oversees the process of making them, as the operations manager of Kays Scotland, which since 2006 has been the exclusive manufacturer of curling stones for the Olympics. “We’re kind of servicing the whole sport,” English said of his small but mighty factory about a 45-minute drive north of Turnberry. “There’s only about 50 workers in here. We’re really busy.”\n\nIt likely will come as no surprise from where Kays harvests its materials for the stones: yes, Aisla Craig her good self.\n\nThe island’s Blue Hone granite is used on the stone’s running edge while its Common Green granite, which is resistant to heat transfer and splintering, composes the body of the stone. It’s a formula Kays has spent the last 175 or so years perfecting, with granite that can be found nowhere else on earth. The factory, which is open four days a week, manufacturers about 12 stones a day or 48 per week with a sticker price of approximately $1,000/per (shipping not included). That might sound steep, but when you consider most stones last about 30 years, the cost also might sound like a bargain.\n\n“We have to keep our own quality standards up for every stone,” English said. “Whether we make a stone for the Olympics or we make a stone for a [curling] club in Alabama, it’s the same quality control, the exact same way of making it goes into it. There’s no difference.”\n\nKays ships stones all over the world, from the U.S. to China, Japan and South Korea to Mongolia and New Zealand, even to . . . Antarctica. “They’re using it as a kind of luxury experience type thing,” English said. “It’s like minus-36 degrees, so I wasn’t sure with the temperature and the conditions how the stones would be, but they seemed to be fine.”\n\nWhile the Aisla Craig’s granite is uniquely suited for curling stones, it also has found its way into Turnberry’s golf shop in the form of ball markers and other granite-based memorabilia. Kays also commissioned a St. Andrews clubmaker to build four hickory golf clubs into which Kays incorporated Common Green granite into the bases. They sold quickly. “So, yes,” English said of his team’s handiwork, “there’s wee ties to golf.”\n\nEnglish said he also sees some crossover between the skills required in both curling and golf, and, indeed, it’s not hard to see the parallels between sliding a stone down a slab of ice and rolling a ball across a slick green. “There are a few curlers that we know of that are actually really good golfers,” he said. “They’ve got the type of skills from curling, with the touch and feel, and they kind of took that into golf.”\n\nBut English has little time to work on his own swing or stroke. He has emails to answer and orders to fill, especially in this busy window during which his stones are enjoying their every-four-years moment in the international spotlight. To capitalize on the publicity, Kays’ online shop has been selling Olympics-themed giftware (coasters, drink cubes) made from Aisla Craig granite. The majority of orders thus far have come from the U.S., and English suspects that’s at least partly due to a certain rap legend on NBC’s coverage team in Milan.\n\n“Snoop Dog was at the curling,” English said. “That might have helped.”\n\nSix-hundred million years of history doesn’t hurt, either.\n\nThe post This iconic golf backdrop plays essential Winter Olympics role appeared first on Golf.",

    "title": "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred optimistic major leaguers will play in 2028 Los Angeles Olympics",
    "description": "Manfred said there are still issues to resolve with the Major League Baseball Players Association before those Olympic aspirations are a reality.",
    "fullText": "PALM BEACH, Fla. — Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred is optimistic that major leaguers will play in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nManfred, speaking following an owners meeting Thursday, said there are still issues to resolve with the Major League Baseball Players Association before those Olympic aspirations are a reality, but “I think we’re a lot closer to there than we were the last time we talked about it,” he said.\n\nThe six-nation baseball tournament will be played from July 13-19 at Dodger Stadium. MLB is planning for an extended All-Star break between July 9 and July 21, with the All-Star Game likely at San Francisco on July 11.\n\nAn agreement with the union is needed.\n\n“I sense a lot of momentum towards playing in LA in 2028,” Manfred said. “I think we are going to get over those issues. I think people have come to appreciate that the Olympics on U.S. soil is a unique marketing opportunity for the game. I think we had a lot of players interested in doing it and, you know, I feel pretty good about the idea (that) we’ll get there.”\n\nIn addition, an agreement is needed on insurance to cover player contracts for time with Olympic teams.\n\nThe United States will have an automatic berth in the both the baseball and softball tournaments and the top two other nations from the Americas in next month’s World Baseball Classic will earn berths.\n\nMLB did not allow players on 40-man rosters to participate in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, when Nippon Professional Baseball interrupted its season and Japan beat the U.S. 2-0 in the gold medal game.\n\nManfred was also asked if the involvement of Casey Wasserman, the prominent businessman and talent agent who has recently lost clients because of his appearance in recently released government files on Jeffrey Epstein, would deter the league from participating in the Olympics. He declined to comment on Wasserman, who is the chairman of the Los Angeles games, saying, “Look, our dealings are not with Casey. Our dealings are with the institution of the Olympics.”\n\nThe addition of star outfielder Kyle Tucker by the Los Angeles Dodgers to what already was among the highest payrolls again sparked debate over whether management will propose a salary cap in collective bargaining this year.\n\nManfred said there hasn’t been much movement in salary cap talks.\n\nTucker, the right fielder who is considered one of the best players in baseball, is the latest accomplished veteran brought in by the Dodgers, who have three of the top eight current contracts by average annual value. Los Angeles also signed top closer Edwin Díaz to bolster its bullpen.\n\n“Look, I think great teams are always good for baseball,” he said. “I think with respect to this particular great team, it added to what we have been hearing from fans in a lot of markets for a long time about the competitiveness of the game. But great teams are always good baseball.”\n\nBargaining is likely to start this spring on a labor contract to succeed the deal that expires Dec. 1.\n\n“We’re in the preparation process,” Manfred said. “We haven’t agreed on a calendar with the MLBPA and it does take two to tango, as they say, but historically after opening day we kind of get started.”\n\nManfred said there likely isn’t a way around insurance issues that have come up for MLB-contracted players planning to play in next month’s World Baseball Classic. Several stars, including Puerto Rico’s Francisco Lindor and Carlos Correa, were left off their countries’ rosters because the WBC insurer wouldn’t cover them.\n\n“We like that, when they say they want to play, obviously,” Manfred said. “But then to have a problem with the insurance and the guy being unable to play, we recognize that. I’m just not sure that there is a way around it.”\n\nThe tournament is co-owned by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association. Insurance is provided by National Financial Partners.\n\n“In order to get clubs comfortable with the idea that guys should play earlier in games they otherwise would not play, we had to protect them financially,” Manfred said.\n\nOwners approved a rules change requiring first- and third-base coaches to remain in the marked coaching boxes. Coaches have frequently moved toward home plate, in a better position to better relay signs from the defensive team that may pick up.\n\nMLB will produce and distribute local television broadcasts of at least 14 teams this season following financial problems of Main Street Sports Group’s FanDuel Sports Network.\n\n“The RSN situation has an impact on our revenue growth because the decline there is a drag on what is otherwise a growing industry,” Manfred said. “It is true that the smaller markets have been hit harder than the larger markets, which impacts revenue sharing. Having said both of those, I think longer term, our content is inherently valuable. We deliver tons of eyeballs, and I think when we have an opportunity to get to market in 2028, we’re going to be just fine.”\n\nManfred said the 14 teams are “probably making a little less than they made under their old contracts.”\n\n“The key word there is old,” he added. “The reason those contracts aren’t there anymore was they were not economic given the cord-cutting that’s going on.”\n\nTeams approved two changes in controlling owners: Cincinnati Reds CEO Phil Castellini succeeds his father Minnesota Twins board member Tom Pohlad takes over from takes over from his younger brother Bob.\n\nManfred said of the San Diego Padres’ sale process: “There is robust interest in what is viewed as a really appealing asset.”\n\nMilwaukee chairman Mark Attanasio and Baltimore control owner David Rubenstein were voted to the eight-man executive council, replacing Arizona managing general partner Ken Kendrick and Seattle chairman John Stanton. The council also includes San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson and Cleveland chairman Paul Dolan (whose terms expire in 2027) and Miami chairman Bruce Sherman and Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno (2028) and New York Mets chairman Steve Cohen and Athletics managing partner John Fisher (2029).\n\nMLB approved extensions of its contract with Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. and of the deals for Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. to carry the Extra Innings package of out-of-market TV broadcasts.",

    "fullText": "The American women’s ski team have provided some extremely compelling stories at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milan/Cortina d’Ampezzo. From the serious injury to Lindsey Vonn to the unexpected gold medal by Breezy Johnson, you might not have heard of the remarkable story of American alpine skier Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon.\n\nAccording to Travis Pittman of the Central Oregon Daily, Wiles survived a plane crash seven months ago in Sisters, Oregon. At the time, Wiles was a passenger on a training flight when the plane dovetailed.\n\nWiles credits her boyfriend Maxime Boutemy of saving her life. Maxime helped Wiles out of the wreckage before the plane went into flames. Wiles’s symptoms were a concussion and burns.\n\nBefore the accident occurred, Wiles had dreams of being a pilot. It will be interesting to see if those dreams still exist, or if Wiles will concentrate now fully on skiing.\n\nHeading into the 2026 Olympic Winter Games, Wiles had won four World Cup downhill medals in alpine skiing, with a lot of success on the Olympic course. She had won a bronze medal at Cortina in 2018, and silver medal in Cortina in 2024.\n\nWiles’s other two World Cup medals were bronze medals in Zauchensee, Austria. The first came in 2017, and the second came last month.\n\nWiles won her Olympic bronze medal with Paula Moltzan of Minneapolis, Minnesota on Tuesday. They had a time of 2:21.91, and beat Mikaela Shiffrin and Johnson by six one hundredths of a second to reach the podium in the women’s team combined competition.

    "description": "The U.S. men's hockey team had two goals disallowed in the first period but there was \"never any panic\" as the Americans beat Latvia.",
    "fullText": "MILAN - Brady Tkachuk tried to put into words what he had just experienced.\n\nThe Americans had just come off the ice at Milano Santagiulia Hockey Arena, where festive and loud fans ensured a fabulous atmosphere for the match against Latvia. Brady Tkachuk had the first goal, set up by his brother, Matthew, en route to a 5-1 victory over Latvia on Thursday, Feb. 12 in the preliminary round of the 2026 Winter Olympics men's hockey tournament.\n\n\"It was amazing, and it was great to see the flags, the chants, and just the support that you have here,\" Brady Tkachuk said. \"Just a little example of the support you have back at home. You're playing in front of millions of Americans, and you just want to represent them well, and it's always an honor to put this jersey on.\"\n\nMore: U.S. men's hockey team ready to play after soaking up Olympic life\n\nThe ice received so-so reviews.\n\n\"I honestly didn't think it was that bad,\" defenseman Charlie McAvoy said. \"I mean, you certainly notice it when it gets later in the period. I had a pretty solid toe pick in the third up top where I had to test my balance pretty good. There are some times where you're like digging in, getting stuck a little. But both teams have to play on the same ice, so you make do.\"\n\nOne of biggest pluses to come out of the game for the Americans may have been the second goal they had overturned. That was a lesson in the zero tolerance policy of international hockey when it comes to making contact with a goaltender in the crease.\n\n\"I don't know that I agreed with the call, but it doesn't matter what I think,\" coach Mike Sullivan said.\n\nThe Latvians also successfully challenged Brock Nelson was offside when Quinn Hughes put the puck in the net shortly after Tkachuk's goal. Latvia tied the game after the overturned goal. It could have been a tough stretch, but the Americans didn't falter.\n\n\"The energy on the bench is terrific,\" Sullivan said. \"They never got deflated. They just, the self-talk and the talk amongst themselves about just staying with it and keep playing, that, we're going to be fine. And, of course, we were. But those types of moments, they can be game-changing moments.\"\n\nLatvia never really posed a threat, even after making it 1-1. In the second period, shots favored the Americans, 17-2.\n\n\"I thought it was a hell of a first, but a couple of goals called back, and then it's just 1-1, but there's never any panic,\" Matthew Tkachuk said. \"The second period on, we just wanted to make sure somebody was out of the net at all times. They were playing pretty tight. The skill and possession and strength that we have, we knew we were going to win some battles, but somebody had to be at the net, so we tried to make it harder on the goalie. We tried to make him haul us down.\"\n\nBrock Nelson scored twice in the second period, nestled around a goal by Tage Thompson. Nelson's second goal was off tic-tac-toe passing from Jack Hughes.\n\nEverything coming up BROCK. NELSON. #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/yy7xGkXiR0\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 12, 2026\n\n\"I was skating up the ice with Jack, a little bit of 2-on-1,\" Nelson said. \"I just tried to give him a little bit more time and try to drive the back post. I peeled out, saw him make a drop pass and another guy come in and I thought maybe one of those guys was going to rip a one-timer, so I just kind of looped around. And then a couple great passes and poise by those guys. I find myself on the back side with space and an open net.\"\n\nAfter Auston Matthews scored in the third period, the Americans eased off a bit. It was, all in all, an excellent first outing for them.\n\n\"I mean, just an unbelievable experience,\" Nelson said. \"I tried to soak it all in. I thought our line was good and made a lot of great plays, good chances, good support and a good team win overall to get it going.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: USA adjusts after disallowed goals to beat Latvia: 'Never any panic'",

    "fullText": "Things are looking up if you’re a fan of the Las Vegas Raiders. New head coach Klint Kubiak is coming off a Super Bowl win as an offensive coordinator/playcaller. Now he’ll take over the Raiders, where he’ll still be calling plays. But now everyone wants to know if the Maxx Crosby trade rumors are legitimate.\n\nAccording to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, the meeting Kubiak had with Crosby was a “positive” one. However, that doesn’t mean things are peachy in Vegas between the Raiders and their second-team All-Pro pass-rusher. Crosby is now weighing a decision of whether he wants to request a trade, but the Raiders still have a chance to salvage this.\n\n“My understanding is that conversation with Klint Kubiak was positive. But there are a lot of other fences that would need to be mended for Crosby to stay in Las Vegas. It is not an impossibility that Crosby is back with the Raiders. It is certainly a possibility that he is not. There are multiple voices here, including Maxx and Klint Kubiak, all the way up to Mark Davis, who are going to be a part of this decision.”\n\nNFL Network’s Tom Pelissero on Maxx Crosby\n\nWe can’t blame Crosby, who’s easily one of the NFL’s best defenders, for wanting to be a part of a winner. He’s played in one postseason game since he arrived as a fourth-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, yet he’s made five Pro Bowl teams in that span.\n\nIn other words, Crosby is far from the reason why the Raiders have been so bad. Now he may want to be part of why a team is so good, and possibly even compete for a Super Bowl ring.\n\nThere’s no telling how long that may take with the new-look Raiders, but Crosby may feel like he’s been waiting this one out long enough. If so, several teams will be in a rush to present their best blockbuster trade offer for the sack master.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders Hire Former NFL Head Coach for Klint Kubiak’s Staff\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers Named ‘Interesting’ Landing Spot for All-Pro Weapon\n\nNew York Giants Connected to Pro Bowl Tight End to Help Jaxson Dart",

Dale Jarrett was the last driver to win from the pole in 2000.\n\nKyle Busch will look to end the long-standing streak on Sunday in the 68th running of the Great American Race. Busch qualified on pole on Wednesday with a speed of 183.651. The streak wasn't on Busch's mind following the run, though.\n\n\"Being able to qualify on my first pole for the Daytona 500, that’s pretty special,” Busch told NASCAR.com on Wednesday. “This feels good. Feels really good for RCR as a group.\"\n\nBusch will make his 21st start in the Daytona 500 on Sunday. Despite winning two NASCAR Cup Series titles, 63 race victories, and countless other accolades, it's been 20 years of trying and 20 years of frustration for Busch in the sport's biggest race.\n\nChase Briscoe's 4th-place run in 2025 is the best finish for a Daytona 500 pole winner during the streak. Briscoe will start alongside Busch on the front row in Sunday's race.\n\nDrivers have won the Daytona 500 from the pole nine times, including Richard Petty (1966), Bill Elliott (1985, 1987), and Jeff Gordon (1999).\n\nBusch says his lack of a Daytona 500 victory is part of what motivates him to continue racing.\n\n\"[It's] obviously another driving factor to that, wanting to come out here,\" Busch said ahead of his qualifying run. \"We only get a chance to do that once a year to try to win that race.\"\n\nThough he's been in the sport for over two decades now, Busch says he has no plans to retire and still wants to win races.\n\nThe remainder of the Daytona 500 field will be set in Thursday's Daytona Duel races. The Daytona 500 is Sunday at 2:30 p.m.",

With the NFL Combine a couple of weeks away, you can expect deals to be made behind closed doors in Indianapolis.\n\nOne of the hottest names expected to be on the market is Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray. The former first-overall pick appears to be on the outside looking in after being benched in 2025 and Arizona hiring a new head coach.\n\nMORE: Las Vegas Raiders snatch up former Chargers, Titans head coach to staff\n\nA lot can change between now and the new league year, but the Cardinals are reportedly beginning to explore trade options. There will be challenges with his contract this year, however.\n\n\"A change of scenery is best for all parties involved.\"@FieldYates weighs in on Kyler Murray's future with the Cardinals\n\n— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) February 12, 2026\n\nAfter 2026, Murray’s contract will have no more guarantees. However, a trading party takes on $34M this season in salary–unless Arizona takes on some of that salary.\n\nThen there is also the idea of compensation. That $34M figure will likely influence trade compensation. If the Cardinals were to eat some of that money, it could reasonably be expected that they would get a better return in a trade.\n\nMORE: George Kittle sends message to 49ers, NFL over wild conspiracy theory\n\nThe Cardinals want to get this done quickly, as Murray’s base salary becomes guaranteed four days after the 2026 new league year date. They could potentially post-June 1 release him, but that would leave no return.\n\nMurray has been linked to multiple teams, including the Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, and even the Cleveland Browns. The Colts are uncertain of Daniel Jones’ recovery timeline, the Jets will likely move on from Fields, and the Browns are always looking for a quarterback.\n\nOne thing feels almost certain: Murray will be in a different uniform only a few years after signing a hefty contract extension.

    "description": "The U.S. men's hockey team scored four unanswered goals, and had a few taken away, led by a pair from Brock Nelson on Thursday in Milan.",
    "fullText": "Brock Nelson might be making his Olympics debut, but he has a rich family history when it comes to playing hockey for Team USA.\n\nHis grandfather was a forward on the team that won gold in 1960. His uncle was a forward on the “Miracle on Ice” team in 1980.\n\nAnd Thursday night, Nelson made a mark of his own. The Colorado Avalanche forward scored two goals to lead the U.S. to a 5-1 victory over Latvia in an opening game that included some of the best American NHL players.\n\n“It’s pretty crazy,” said Nelson, 34, considered the old man on a team filled with some of the game’s brightest young stars. “It’s just an unbelievable experience. I’m trying to soak it all in.”\n\nThe Americans had to show resilience after two of their goals were wiped out in the first period by successful challenges. It’s rare to have two such reversals in a game, exceedingly rare to have two in the same period.\n\n“Yeah, that was frustrating,” said defenseman Zach Werenski, who plays for the Columbus Blue Jackets. “But at the same time, you’re still getting the goals even though they got overturned. You’re doing the work to put the puck in the net, and I think that helps your confidence a little bit. After they get overturned, you’ve just got to put it out of your mind and continue to play the same way.”\n\nLatvia was competitive early, forging a 1-1 tie in the first period, but eventually fell prey to a U.S. barrage. The Americans outshot Latvia, 38-18, and starter Connor Hellebuyck needed to make only 17 saves.\n\n“It was just 1-1 but there was never any panic,” said forward Matthew Tkachuk, the Florida Panthers winger. “From the second period on, we just wanted to make sure someone was at the net at all times. They were playing pretty tight, but with the skill and puck possession and strength that we have, we knew we were going to win some battles.”\n\nNelson, who said he takes a ribbing from his young teammates for his graying hair, has a rich family history when it comes to Olympic hockey. His grandfather, Bill Christian, won gold at the Games in Squaw Valley — now called Olympic Valley — and his uncle, Dave Christian, was on that championship team in Lake Placid.\n\n“My brother came in today,” said Nelson, raised in Minneapolis. “He brought me a couple pins from back home, from 'Hockeytown,' and a couple letters from the youth team. They’ve always been supportive of me, going back to growing up there. I’m forever grateful for that.”\n\nThe U.S. team features brothers Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, and Quinn and Jack Hughes — all NHL players. It has been 12 years since NHL players last took the Olympic stage.\n\n“To make this roster is extremely difficult when you look at the amount of talent that the United States has developed and can play at this level,” said coach Mike Sullivan, who doubles as coach of the New York Rangers.\n\nThe fans were fairly evenly divided, with every U-S-A chant countered with one for LAT-VI-A.\n\n“It was great to see the flags, the chants, and just the support that you have here,” said U.S. forward Brady Tkachuk, who was raised in a suburb of St. Louis and plays for the Ottawa Senators. “I'm just kind of a little example of the support you have back at home. So you're playing in front of millions of millions of Americans, and you just want to represent them well, and it’s always an honor to put this jersey on.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Williamsburg's swim team is writing inspiring history with its largest roster ever. Meet the individuals making it possible.",
    "fullText": "Dec. 17, 2025, was a historic night for Williamsburg High School's athletic program.\n\nDuring a swim meet at New Richmond High School, the Wildcats, whose team has grown from two athletes in 2024-2025 to 10 swimmers this year, fielded a boys relay team and girls relay team for the first time in school history.\n\n\"I never really got to be in a high school relay and having it my senior year was even more special for me. It's really going to be a core memory as long as I live,\" Taylor Sefton said.\n\nFor the majority of her career, Sefton has been one of the only swimmers on a Williamsburg team that is now rapidly growing under the supervision of her father, fourth-year coach Bill Sefton.\n\n\"They all work well together. They're a fantastic team. They all get along, nobody has any problems and they work hard. I can't ask for anything else as a coach,\" Bill said.\n\nTaylor started the 2024-2025 season alongside Cameron Karschnik, whose older brother, Jonah, was a two-time state qualifier in the 100-yard butterfly. Cameron couldn't finish the season due to a back injury, but Bill is hopeful that he'll return next season.\n\nIn the twilight of her high school career, Taylor is attempting to become just the second female swimmer at Williamsburg to qualify for the state meet. Betsy Brockman won back-to-back 200-yard individual medley state titles in 2001 and 2002, setting a previous DII state record with a time of 2:04.98 as a senior.\n\n\"It would just be another accomplishment for myself. If I can only make districts four times in a row and I end up not making state, I won't be too upset because I know the work I put in wasn't for nothing,\" Taylor said.\n\nBill keeps a time board at practice, a chart of each swimmer's best times and which strokes they will compete in at upcoming meets. In the bottom right corner of the board is the list of school records he has found. Taylor's name is listed next to five of the seven individual records; Brockman owns the other two.\n\nJunior Jarvis Zach, who owns the 50-yard freestyle school record, has one of the more interesting experiences on the team. Before this school year, he emigrated from Germany to live with his grandma and is waiting for his parents to get an approved visa so they can move to the United States. His mother was a swimming teacher and encouraged him to try the sport.\n\nMoving to the United States, he immediately noticed differences in the practice and meet structure from his homeland, where sports are more club-oriented, as opposed to high school competition.\n\n\"I did swimming once in Germany, but it was for maybe two weeks and I really enjoyed it. Also in my free time, I swim a lot so I decided to join the swim team. I heard that it was starting new so I wanted to see how it was,\" Zach said.\n\nIn joining the swim team, Zach hopes to recruit others to continue to grow the program.\n\nCarter Conatser joined halfway through this season after recovering from a football injury. He runs track in the spring and was looking for a way to keep his conditioning up.\n\n\"By the time track would come around, I'd die for the first three or four weeks doing conditioning,\" Conatser said. \"I love this sport. It's the perfect sport to get into shape and feel loose by the time spring comes around.\"\n\nAs first-year swimmers on a team with seven freshmen, Zach and Conatser are quickly learning that, despite their inexperience, they need to be leaders for their younger counterparts.\n\n\"Being an upperclassman and at the same time learning a completely new sport is a very tough thing to do. Trying to encourage others to do their best while also trying to get up to where their level is has definitely been an adjustment,\" Conatser said.\n\nOn a team where everyone is teaching each other new skills, freshman Mallory Murphy stands out. She showed up on the first day of practice with all the confidence in the world but was quickly humbled when she discovered that she didn't know how to swim.\n\n\"I was flailing in the water. I would swim and I wasn't moving. I would basically be standing still in the water but I kept going because everybody was like, 'You're doing good. You're growing.' All my teammates were always there for me. They didn't let me get upset about not doing good. So I just kept trying and I never gave up,\" Murphy said.\n\nSaid Bill, \"She comes to practice every day and completes all her sets. We couldn't be more proud of all the kids on the team.\"\n\nFilling out the freshman class is Norah Bates, Owen Bickett, Landon Johnson, Sophia Lincoln, Jakob Karajic and Marley Minning. According to Sefton's research, Johnson already owns the 100-yard breaststroke school record.\n\n\"It's my first year swimming and I will say the community here is great - the whole swim community, not just our team,\" Lincoln said.\n\nThen there's eighth-grader Bailey Sefton, who can't yet swim on varsity but Bill believes she will break Taylor's records, and even some of Brockman's over the next four years.\n\nBill anticipates adding three total swimmers next year.\n\n\"Hopefully next season, we start off with water acclimation and my group that's already been doing it, they in turn teach the other kids that are coming into the program,\" Bill said.\n\nThe Wildcats instantly set school records in the 200-yard medley relay and 200-yard freestyle relay, and Sefton hopes to have enough swimmers in 2026-2027 to field a 400-yard freestyle relay team, but this season has been about so much more than the times.\n\nAt the start of the season, the majority of the team was warming up with just swimming one lap of freestyle. Now, they start practice with a 500-yard warm-up before focusing on different strokes.\n\nThe amount of behind-the-scenes work hasn't gone unnoticed either. Assistant coach Logan Minning is a teacher at Williamsburg and the mother of freshman Marley Minning. Being at the school during the day allows her to communicate with athletic director Jason Moberly, the athletes and parents while Sefton works as a firefighter and Emergency Medical Technician.\n\n\"She's been a huge help for me. I'm so thankful to have her as part of the team,\" Bill said.\n\nWilliamsburg is building a new multi-purpose athletic center, but it doesn't have a pool, so the team practices at the Clermont Family YMCA in Batavia. The Ohio High School Athletic Association allows high school teams to practice for 90 minutes a day and the staff at the Y allows the Wildcats to use the pool whenever they need it.\n\n\"They've been great. They're awesome, letting us practice whenever we want. I give them the majority of the credit because we couldn't have made it happen without them,\" Bill said.\n\nA few team members will even take jobs as lifeguards, helping to further advance their aquatic pedigree.\n\nWilliamsburg's team seemingly came out of nowhere this year, but it has been a work in progress from day one. This team isn't one large story, it's a collection of individual triumphs, adding to the school's distinguished athletic history.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Williamsburg High School swim team grows, inspires, breaks records",

Michigan State is projected to play Bentley in the first round, who is the lowest ranked team currently slated to make the field. The other matchup in the Spartans' region is No. 2 seed Cornell vs. No. 3 seed Denver -- which would pit a team who knocked out the Spartans in last year's tournament against a team that would have a relative home ice advantage.\n\nMichigan State recently took over as the No. 1 team in the NPI rankings -- which are used to seed and field the 16 teams that'll make the NCAA Tournament. In gaining the overall No. 1 seed, Michigan State would be in line for a notably easier matchup than if they were lower in the seeding lines.\n\nMichigan State sits at 22-6-0 overall and 13-5-0 in Big Ten play with six regular season games remaining.

    "description": "The Detroit Lions blocked the Dolphins’ request to interview Bruce Gradkowski — denying help to new Miami head coach and former Packers DC Jeff Hafley.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions aren’t just protecting their coaching staff, they’re also leaning into a familiar rivalry.\n\nAccording to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, the Miami Dolphins, now led by former Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, requested permission to interview Lions offensive assistant Bruce Gradkowski for their quarterbacks coach position. Dan Campbell reportedly blocked the request, making it clear that Gradkowski isn’t going anywhere.\n\nGiven Hafley’s Packers ties, the move feels especially fitting.\n\nDan Campbell and the Lions have spent years battling Green Bay for control of the NFC North, and now that a former Packers coordinator is running Miami, Detroit had little incentive to do any favors. Blocking the request not only keeps a valued coach in-house, it also denies help to a former rival.\n\nGradkowski has been with the Lions since 2025 and is viewed internally as a rising offensive mind. Before arriving in Detroit, he served as the offensive coordinator for the St. Louis BattleHawks of the UFL, helping build an offense that put him firmly on the NFL coaching radar.\n\nAs a player, Gradkowski starred at Toledo before being selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the sixth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He went on to play for the St. Louis Rams, Cleveland Browns, Oakland Raiders, Cincinnati Bengals, and Pittsburgh Steelers, carving out a long professional career. His younger brother, Gino Gradkowski, is also a former NFL player.\n\nDetroit’s decision sends a clear message: Bruce Gradkowski is part of the Lions’ present — and future — and Dan Campbell isn’t about to help a former Packers coach rebuild elsewhere.\n\nThe post Report: Dan Campbell Sends Message by Blocking Dolphins’ Interview Request appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Denver Summit FC is officially joining the NWSL as the league’s 16th franchise for the 2026 season.\n\nAiming for a Rocky Mountain high, this expansion club won’t just make up the numbers. With a star-studded roster, a world-class manager in Nick Cushing, and ticket sales already shattering expectations for their March debut, the Summit is poised to prove that the women’s game belongs at a mile high.\n\nSo what is it about Denver that makes this latest addition stand out? The name speaks for itself, setting the stage for the summit this club wishes to achieve. In hopes of bringing people together and striving to reach new heights on and off the pitch, Denver hopes to make immediate waves in the women’s game.\n\nThe ’14ers’ — the club’s official supporters group — are ready to bring the energy for a roster that is already turning heads. The front office has assembled a star-studded lineup that includes Abby Smith, Ally Brazier, Carson Pickett, Kaleigh Kurtz, and Janine Sonis.\n\nPerhaps the biggest splash is the arrival of Lindsey Heaps, who will join the squad later this season. From the front line to the goal, Denver Summit is ready to bring the heat with legitimate attacking power and a skilled defensive presence.\n\nCommanding the team is a manager that global soccer fans will instantly recognize: Nick Cushing.\n\nCushing brings a championship pedigree to Denver, having previously served as the head coach of Manchester City in the WSL. Most recently, he managed New York City FC on the MLS side, giving him a unique blend of NWSL-adjacent and European experience that the club hopes will translate to immediate success.\n\nRounding out the inaugural staff are assistant coaches Angela Salem and Alan Mahon. Former England international Karen Bardsley joins as goalkeeper coach, with James Mitchell serving as video coach.\n\nNow, where is this team going to be based? Denver Summit will play at two sites before moving into its own stadium.\n\nFollowing the first home opener at Empower Field, the journey will continue in Commerce City, Colorado, at the Dick’s Sporting Goods Park throughout the spring.\n\nIn July, the next phase will be to open up Centennial Stadium, which will be in mid-summer. This stadium will serve as their home for the remainder of the 2026 home matches and throughout the 2027 season.\n\nAs the season approaches, President Jen Millet notes that the community is already welcoming this team with open arms.\n\n“There is nothing more powerful than a city showing for its team. Crossing the 25,000 mark for the kickoff tells us everything we need to know about what this moment means to Denver,” said Millet.\n\nDenver Summit FC will take center stage against the Washington Spirit on March 28 at Empower Field for their inaugural home opener. Ticket sales are already skyrocketing — as of February 4, the club has sold more than 40,000 tickets, putting them on track to sell out the lower bowl and potentially challenge league attendance records.\n\nBefore the home opener, fans will get their first glimpse of the squad in action this month. Denver Summit FC will make its debut at the Coachella Valley Invitational in Indio, California. The preseason tournament featuring both MLS and NWSL clubs will introduce Denver to two league opponents in the desert.\n\nSunday, Feb. 15: vs. Utah Royals FC (2:00 p.m. PT)\n\nSaturday, Feb. 21: vs. San Diego Wave FC (12:00 p.m. PT)\n\nThese matches serve not only to build chemistry on the pitch but also to give the ’14ers’ their first taste of NWSL competition. With the tools in place and a community ready to support them, the Summit is poised to break boundaries and expand the women’s game in 2026.\n\nFort Lauderdale United appoints Paul Jennison as interim head coach\n\nSydney FC part ways with most successful ever head coach Ante Jurić\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback",

    "title": "Bears S review: Grading Kevin Byard, Jaquan Brisker in 2025",
    "description": "Our Bears position group review continues with safety, which had more continuity than we've seen in a long time.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears had a magical 2025 season under first-year head coach Ben Johnson, where they went from worst to first with an 11-6 record, NFC North title and the franchise's first playoff win in 15 years. And there's no denying that the future is bright.\n\nWhile the Bears exceeded expectations in their first year under Johnson, there's still plenty of work to be done with this roster, most notably on defense. After overhauling the offense in the trenches and at skill positions, the focus shifts to the defense where the hope is general manager Ryan Poles does the same to round out this unit under defensive coordinator Dennis Allen and form a complete team with a top-five offense.\n\nHere at Bears Wire, we're going position by position through the 2025 Bears and grading every player. Rounding out the defense are the safeties, which had more continuity than we have seen in a long time. All four safeties played in 17 games this season and featured an All-Pro, Kevin Byard.\n\n2025 stats: 93 total tackles, 4 for loss, 7 interceptions, 8 pass breakups (17 games)\n\nKevin Byard turned back the clock in 2025 with one of his best seasons in his 10-year career. The ball-hawking safety was all over the place in 2025, leading the league in interceptions while baiting quarterbacks into making poor throws. In Week 4 alone, Byard caught Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith sleeping by picking him off twice on the same play. The team captain used his savvy veteran skills many times to break up deeper passes and keep a leaky secondary from breaking down. For his efforts, Byard was named First-Team All-Pro and made the Pro Bowl, both for the third time in his career. The only downside to Byard's season is he allowed more touchdowns (seven) than ever before, but all in all, 2025 was one to remember. It should be enough to warrant a contract extension as Byard enters free agency.\n\n2025 stats: 93 total tackles, 1 for loss, 1 sack, 3 QB hits, 1 interception, 8 pass breakups (17 games)\n\nOne of the biggest questions heading into the 2025 season was how Jaquan Brisker would look and hold up as he made his return to the field. Brisker hadn't seen any action since October of 2024 due to suffering a scary concussion that sidelined him for the rest of the season. But to his credit, Brisker came back strong and played all 17 games for the first time in his career. The fourth-year safety wasn't as impactful as Byard and struggled in pass coverage, allowing a 127.6 passer rating. Some of Brisker's struggles were due to injuries around him, though. Because the Bears rarely had their complete cornerback group on the field together, Brisker wasn't able to play the Swiss Army Knife role he does so well. When the Bears eventually got healthy in the secondary, Brisker shined. That was evident in the divisional playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams when Brisker notched 14 tackles, one for a loss, a sack, and two pass breakups. Like Byard, Brisker is also an impending free agent, though his return isn't nearly as certain. If he played his last game as a Bear, Brisker made sure it counted.\n\n2025 stats: 19 total tackles (17 games)\n\nIn prior seasons, Elijah Hicks was pressed into starting duty due to injuries for a stretch of games. That wasn't the case in 2025, though, so the fourth-year safety had fewer opportunities to make an impact on defense. He had some shine, though. Hicks saw extended time playing against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns and made key plays in both games. He primarily contributed on special teams, however, proving to be a quality option for Richard Hightower's group. Hicks is a solid depth player who could find his way back to the Bears in 2026 as he enters free agency.\n\n2025 stats: 19 total tackles (17 games)\n\nIn his second season with the Bears, Jonathan Owens was primarily a special teams player and didn't see too much time at safety. Like Hicks, he saw limited snaps on defense with Byard and Brisker staying healthy. As the season went on, Hicks overtook Owens as the third safety in specific coverage packages. Owens flew under the radar for much of the year on the field, though his wife, Simone Biles, made sure he was newsworthy otherwise. He's another pending free agent, and his future with the Bears is up in the air.\n\nThe best ability is availability, and the Bears safeties aced that test, having played in every single game, including the postseason. That's an accomplishment on its own. Kevin Byard was very clearly the star of the position group, having led the team in interceptions and anchoring the back seven of the defense. While Jaquan Brisker's play wasn't as consistent as originally hoped, he made key plays throughout the year and bounced back from a serious injury. All in all, it was a solid season for this group, but with every player hitting free agency, it's going to look much different in 2026.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears S review: Grading Kevin Byard, Jaquan Brisker in 2025",

    "fullText": "After being knocked out by Badalona in the Copa de la Reina quarter-finals, Real Sociedad got revenge with a 2-0 victory over the Catalan side on Liga F match-day 19.\n\nMeanwhile, Deportivo La Coruña ran riot in their 6-1 thrashing of Madrid CFF. Barcelona kept their winning streak ticking after a visit to Logroño, meaning they remain ten points clear at the top of the Liga F table.\n\nHere’s how the latest round of results unfolded in Spain’s top flight.\n\nReal Sociedad bounced back from their extra-time cup defeat to Badalona with a successful league outing at the weekend. Claire Lavogez netted the opener in the 15th minute of Sunday’s contest. After seeing her initial effort saved, the 31-year-old pounced on the rebound to tap in from close range.\n\nThe scoreline remained slender until Nerea Eizagirre made sure of the three points in the sixth minute of stoppage time. The substitute cleverly cut inside onto her left foot before driving the ball past the goalkeeper at the near post. Real Sociedad have now collected 41 points from 19 matches, giving them an eight-point cushion to Tenerife in fourth spot.\n\nDeportivo’s Esperanza Pizarro emphatically dispatched an emphatic penalty to get the scoring up and running in Sunday’s meeting with Madrid CFF. Emilie Nautnes produced the response for the hosts, only for Merle Barth to pounce on a rebound to restore the visitors’ slender lead in first half stoppage time. Like Barth, Raquel García tapped in from a parry to take Dépor’s tally to three.\n\nMadrid’s hopes of staging a fightback were quickly quashed by two stunning efforts. First, Vera Martínez let fly from the left side of the box, firing a fierce shot out of Paola Ulloa’s reach and in at the far post. Paula Gutiérrez then conjured up her own impressive strike, curling a shot from distance over Ulloa to register her second goal in three games. There was still time left in the contest for Paula Monteagudo to pile the misery on the hosts with a sixth goal for the confident away side.\n\nIn addition to Dépor, there were also big wins for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Sevilla on match-day 19.\n\nAfter failing to break the deadlock in the first period, Barcelona moved through the gears to score three goals in six minutes in the early stages of the second half against DUX Logroño. Carla Julià Martínez opened the scoring in Logroño, tapping in from Caroline Graham Hansen’s ball across goal. Kika Nazareth then added a second following a neat passing move, before Vicky López netted her eighth league goal of the season to wrap up a 3-0 triumph.\n\nThere was also a 3-0 success for Barcelona’s Clásico rivals Real Madrid. Signe Bruun got Las Blancas up and running against Espanyol, making a well-timed run in behind to collect Athenea del Castillo’s through pass before firing past Romane Salvador. Del Castillo soon put her own name on the scoresheet, before Sara Holmgaard netted her second Liga F goal to seal a comfortable victory.\n\nLucía Moral netted a brace in Sevilla’s comfortable 4-0 home win over Athletic Club at the weekend. The 21-year-old opened the scoring from the penalty spot, before Fatou Kanteh doubled the advantage in first-half stoppage time. Moral required less than 10 second-half minutes to grab her second, curling an attempted cross over Adriana Nanclares and in at the far post. The scoring was wrapped up by Raquel Morcillo, who headed in from Kanteh’s inch-perfect cross to record her third league goal of the campaign.\n\nGranada, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten run to five matches (W4, D1) with a 2-0 away win over Eibar. Laura Pérez’s grabbed the opener in the 38th minute, stealing possession off goalkeeper Eunate Astralaga to leave her with the simple task of rolling the ball into the empty net. Pérez then provided the assist for Granada’s second, playing an inch-perfect pass for Sonya Keefe to gather and then evade a challenge and goalkeeper before she slid it home to register her eighth Liga F goal of the season.\n\nElsewhere, Atlético Madrid followed their 4-1 win over Athletic Club in the Copa de la Reina quarter-finals with a 1-0 success against relegation-threatened Levante. Silvia Lloris scored the decisive goal against her former club, clinching Atleti’s first Liga F win since beating Badalona in November.\n\nTenerife also claimed a narrow win in their home clash with Alhama. Natalia Ramos scored the only goal of the game in the 39th minute, with her deep free-kick evading everyone in the box before drifting into the net. Alhama’s hopes of salvaging a draw were effectively ended when Encarni Jiménez was dismissed for two bookable offences in the early stages of the second period.\n\nDeportivo scored just three goals in their eight away league games this term. They have now scored 10 in their last two Liga F road trips.\n\nFor us, Gutiérrez pips her Deportivo teammate, Martínez, for the best goal of the weekend.\n\nCosta Adeje Tenerife 1-0 Alhama\n\nMadrid CFF 1-6 Deportivo La Coruña\n\nUWCL: Renée Slegers and Laia Codina preview Arsenal clash vs OH Leuven\n\nLiga F match-day 18 round-up: Caroline Weir gets Real Madrid over the line in six-goal thriller\n\nExclusive: New Brighton signing Olivia Garcia talks European dream and international options ahead of loan move",

    "description": "Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss has secured the ability to return to the program for another year.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss has secured the ability to return to the program for another year.\n\nVia Pete Thamel of ESPN.com, a Mississippi judge has granted Chambliss a preliminary injunction against the NCAA. Among other things, the judge concluded that the NCAA acted in bad faith when denying Chambliss a medical redshirt based on a respiratory issue that kept him from playing in 2022, while enrolled at Ferris State. He didn't play a single snap that year, and he didn't dress for games.\n\nThe selection of a Mississippi state court clearly helped Chambliss. It's a home-court advantage to have the case resolved by a Mississippi judge who was elected by (and presumably hopes to be re-elected by) Mississippi voters. As it would be for any student at any school based in any state where the NCAA operates.\n\nGiven that the order will apply as the case proceeds, Chambliss will be permitted to play unless the presiding judge resolves the case in the NCAA's favor before the end of the 2026 season — or unless the NCAA can overturn the ruling via appeal to a higher Mississippi court.\n\nIn the face of its latest courtroom failure, the NCAA was predictably defiant.\n\n\"This decision in a state court illustrates the impossible situation created by differing court decisions that serve to undermine rules agreed to by the same NCAA members who later challenge them in court,\" the NCAA said in a statement. \"We will continue to defend the NCAA's eligibility rules against repeated attempts to rob future generations of the opportunity to compete in college and experience the life-changing opportunities only college sports can create.\n\n\"The NCAA and its member schools are making changes to deliver more benefits to student-athletes, but the patchwork of state laws and inconsistent, conflicting court decisions make partnering with Congress essential to provide stability for current and future college athletes.\"\n\nThat's code for the ongoing plea to get Congress to federalize college sports, and to allow the schools to return to the days of blatant antitrust violations. To date, that effort has gone nowhere.\n\nAnd the NCAA's ridiculous sky-is-falling! message is exhausting. If Trinidad Chambliss, or anyone else, has remaining eligibility, he should be entitled to use it. If the folks at Ole Miss decide it's in the best interests of the program to keep Chambliss on the field and if he can show that the rules should give him another year, the ridiculous rhetoric about \"future generations\" being \"robbed\" of \"opportunity\" should be ignored. It's not making the NCAA's current situation or reputation any better.\n\nIn recent years, the NCAA has gradually been exposed as nothing more than a shield behind which the various schools had previously hidden to justify not paying players. And even though the NCAA surely pines for the days when it had real power, the institution is currently nothing more than a toothless, arbitrary bureaucracy.\n\nFrankly, the sooner the NCAA goes away, the better off the member universities and their student-athlete-employees will be. The NCAA is currently trying to help only itself, by finding a solution to the current college-sports chaos that doesn't result in the NCAA's extinction.",

    "fullText": "Fort Lauderdale United has appointed Paul Jennison as interim head coach for the remainder of the Gainbridge Super League season.\n\nJennison, who began the season as Lauderdale’s goalkeeper coach and head assistant, will take charge until the end of the USL 2025/26 season.\n\nOriginally from Middlesbrough, Jennison brings a wealth of experience to his role as head coach. He has more than 17 years of coaching experience gained across collegiate, academy, and international football.\n\nPrior to joining Fort Lauderdale, Jennison held the role of assistant coach and goalkeeper coach for the University of South Carolina men’s football programme. He also coached Northwestern University’s women’s programme.\n\nThis wealth of experience will be useful to Fort Lauderdale. The side is currently second bottom in the Gainbridge Super League standings. As the USL was established as part of an effort to bridge the gap between youth and professional football, Jennison’s vast experience in the collegiate system will surely prove beneficial.\n\nUpon taking charge, Jennison said, “I’m excited for this tremendous opportunity. This is a special place, and we certainly have a very bright future.\n\n“The important thing is to build on our already well-established foundation and bring in the collective together so we can move the team forward. We’re very excited about the players we have on the roster and how we can continuously bring the best out of them. We appreciate the support from our community and are looking forward to continuing to give them a team they can rally behind.”\n\nTyrone Mears, President of Soccer, added: “Paul has earned this opportunity through his work ethic, leadership, and commitment to our players.\n\n“He has been an important part of our technical staff this season and understands the standards and culture we are building at Fort Lauderdale United. We believe in continuity, we believe in our pathway, and we have full confidence in Paul as we enter a critical stretch of the season.”\n\nFans will hope Jennison can get a crucial three points on the board as they face Brooklyn FC on Valentine’s Day.\n\nWSL: Sonia Bompastor extends Chelsea contract until 2030\n\nSydney FC part ways with most successful ever head coach Ante Jurić\n\nExclusive: New Brighton signing Olivia Garcia talks European dream and international options ahead of loan move",

    "fullText": "Trinidad Chambliss wins case amid NCAA lawyers ghosting the judge originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NCAA’s absence spoke almost as loudly as the judge’s ruling.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon in a Mississippi courtroom, Trinidad Chambliss was granted a preliminary injunction that effectively awards him an extra year of eligibility, clearing the way for the Ole Miss quarterback to play in 2026.\n\nBut as Judge Robert Whitwell prepared to deliver his decision, one detail stood out. The NCAA’s counsel had already left the courtroom and was not present for the final ruling. The hearing in Pittsboro, Miss. marked the culmination of a fight between Chambliss, Ole Miss officials and the NCAA over whether a medically sidelined 2022 season at Ferris State Bulldogs should count against his eligibility clock.\n\nIn 20+ years of law practice, I've never seen opposing counsel leave the court before the decision was rendered. That's bizarre. https://t.co/Z1Q8LQS0xF\n\n— We Run the Sip (@OMRebelNation) February 12, 2026\n\nChambliss did not dress for a game that year, battling significant respiratory issues before undergoing a tonsillectomy. The NCAA denied his waiver request three separate times, including an initial application, an appeal and a reconsideration request submitted with additional medical documentation.\n\nThe association maintained that he was not denied the opportunity to compete and therefore did not qualify for a medical hardship waiver.\n\nOle Miss officials sharply disagreed, arguing that the documented medical circumstances warranted approval at the staff level. After exhausting internal NCAA channels, Chambliss filed suit in Chancery Court, seeking both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nMore: Demond Williams bombshell could've resulted in Lane Kiffin being fired at LSU\n\nThe financial stakes are substantial. Chambliss’ return to Oxford is tied to a compensation package reportedly exceeding $5 million in name, image and likeness earnings. It's a figure that shows the shifting economic realities of college football.\n\nThe judge’s ruling allows Chambliss to take the field while the broader legal battle continues.

    "fullText": "Bruno Mota may have departed, but behind the scenes, Anyang are confident they can improve on last season's eighth-place finish. Minimal recruitment, combined with an aging squad of out-of-contract stars, suggests this could be a more challenging season for the Violets.\n\nA debut K League 1 season of a few lows, but numerous highs. It was a memorable year covering Anyang for the website — I can't imagine how special it was as a fan or a player. After several near misses, Anyang won promotion in 2024 and knew they faced a tough season. Their squad was the oldest in the league and lacked real experience at this level. But it didn't matter. Anyang finished eighth, well clear of relegation, with the foundations built to become a K League 1 regular.\n\nThe low point of the season was a dreadful summer run that saw the team lose six in seven matches and drop to 11th. That run looked set to continue when Daejeon led 2-1 with time running out in August. However, a red card and a Matheus Oliveira double rescued the game — and their season. That kick-started a seven-game unbeaten run, which included a historic win in Seoul.\n\nHan Ka-ram celebrates his Goal of the Month against Gimcheon.\n\nSurvival was effectively guaranteed when Anyang played kingmaker before the split. In their best performance of the year, Gimcheon Sangmu were slaughtered, thanks in part to Han Ka-ram's wonder goal. The 4-1 win handed Jeonbuk Hyundai the title, cementing Anyang's right to be taken seriously. This club has arrived.\n\nBrazilian striker Bruno Mota has joined K League 1 champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors on loan until the end of the season, but Anyang don't expect him to return. The big striker enjoyed a glorious single season in Anyang, leading the line in their debut K League 1 campaign. His 14 goals will be difficult to replace, not to mention his positive contribution to the clubhouse atmosphere.\n\nFC Anyang is an old team, especially in defence and goal. Kim Da-sol was a brilliant signing, leading the team to promotion and then eighth place in K League 1. Da-sol is out of contract next winter and, at 37, is nearing the end of his career. Jeong-hoon (24) started the Cup final win over Gwangju and can now bide his time before taking over between the sticks.\n\nThe man entrusted with the impossible task of replacing Bruno Mota is 26-year-old forward Breno Herculano, on loan from CRB in Brazil's Serie B. Anyang love the lone target man who is quick, holds the ball up, chases lost causes down the flanks, and is good in the air. Herculano will also need to score goals. In his professional career, he has averaged exactly one goal every five matches.\n\nThomas Oude Kotte scored one of the most important goals in Anyang's history.\n\nA player who needs no introduction. Thomas is already a legend in Anyang after a stunning debut season that saw him nominated for the Best XI and earn a call-up for Team K League against Newcastle United. Thomas began life in Korea as a centre-back, then shifted to left-back, before operating at a very high level in midfield. This form and versatility saw his name linked with several big clubs, but Anyang moved quickly to offer him a new deal. He was recently named vice-captain.\n\nWinger Chae features in this category for the second straight season, and it is no surprise. The 21-year-old was nominated for K League 1 Young Player of the Season thanks to four goals in 33 appearances. Chae was involved in more matchday squads than any other Anyang player. With Yago's move to Malaysia, Chae is likely to be busy again in 2026.\n\nOfficials at Anyang are confident the club can improve on their 2025 final position, but until they secure an obvious replacement for Bruno Mota, that is hard to envisage. Mota was a brilliant signing — the right man at the right time. Anyang went up in 2024 without a recognised goalscorer. They fixed that by signing the K League 2 top goalscorer, Mota.\n\nThe Brazilian was an instant hit. He headed home the winner on his debut in Ulsan, one of 14 league goals. He earned a nomination for the Best XI and played 90 minutes for Team K League in the glamour friendly with Newcastle United. Off the field, the impact was just as strong. Anyang players told me throughout the year that Mota was the natural link between the Brazilians and the Koreans — the man who acted as the go-between. Those are big boots to fill.\n\nAnyang have shown themselves to be a model that all city-owned, small-market clubs can aspire to. Building a squad comes down to budgets, smart scouting, and effective player retention, but where Anyang really excel is off the pitch. They have the same disadvantages as many of their competitors: a slightly dilapidated, large multipurpose stadium that isn't fit for football. There's no shelter from rain, snow, or sun, and thousands of seats offer a poor view.\n\nSo what was the response? Build three pitchside temporary stands to minimise the impact of the running track. It isn't pretty, but it is very effective. They also added a new club beer — Sukhavati — and made “Zombie” the new club anthem. As a result, Anyang have generated one of the best matchday experiences in Korea. You don't need the Pohang Steel Yard to make it fun.",

    "description": "Brentford 1-1 Arsenal: The Bees hit back against the Gunners, who lacked enough conviction in their play, meaning Man City are now just four points behind the Premier League leaders",
    "fullText": "Arsenal did the difficult part, but then faltered at what they’re supposed to be best at, making this title challenge that bit more testing. Except, much of that was down to Brentford. Keith Andrews’s side beat – or perhaps drew with – Arsenal at their own game.\n\nBrentford fully deserved Keane Lewis-Potter’s set-piece equaliser, and the 1-1 draw ultimately leaves Arsenal’s lead down to just four points.\n\nThey even looked likelier to win it at the end, Gabriel Martinelli’s late chance only came after Arsenal required crucial interventions from Cristhian Mosquera and Declan Rice.\n\nThat is why Brentford are still seen as one of the Premier League’s acid tests, perhaps even more testing than ever before. It is the most classic battle, the one teams have to really work through.\n\nFailing to win this fixture isn’t a sign you won’t win the title, but it’s a match that goes some way to showing your mettle and how you can really go through the gears in a title race.\n\nArsenal’s minimalism wasn’t enough here. It may end up serving as another warning.\n\nMikel Arteta will nevertheless be most frustrated that it should have been enough. Arsenal had the lead through Noni Madueke’s fine header, only for the team that normally shuts down games to see themselves opened up again and again.\n\nBrentford just forced them open. On conceding the goal, they immediately upped it in so many ways. It’s rare to see Arsenal so threatened on set-pieces.\n\nMaybe part of that was down to the absence of William Saliba.\n\nThe Gunners didn’t get going until it was too late in the game, allowing Brentford that margin.\n\nThat could be seen in the fact that they had just one shot in the first half, their lowest in an opening 45 minutes since a 5-0 thrashing to Manchester City in August 2021.\n\nIt is a balance that Arteta still has to figure out, as he too often leans towards control too often. The sense remains of a team trying to win the league on calculated probabilities rather than the true end product, of being so close now that the coach is now not taking enough risks.\n\nYou almost extend it to the expenditure.\n\nOne reason that Arsenal are where they are across all competitions is their squad depth, and yet there are moments when it’s hard not to wonder whether they could have used their budget in a slightly different way.\n\nThe starting attack in this game was a prime example. As good as Viktor Gyokeres and Madueke are in their own way, would the club have been better served pooling the money for both together, in the region of £107m, and going for one “killer”. An elevated star that they are still missing.\n\nEven Leandro Trossard, brilliant as he’s been for the club, often feels like he should be the impact sub rather than the starter.\n\nEberechi Eze was signed to offer that extra stardust, but it is going to be difficult to rise to the occasion when he is constantly in and out.\n\nAnd, after that first half, Arteta made the changes.\n\nMartin Odegaard was introduced. The Norwegian did have an initial impact, which helped force the opener.\n\nThere was a sense of what might have been.\n\nMadueke remains a tantalisingly frustrating player, as if there are still elements missing to complete his game. One is delivery.\n\nThere are so many occasions when he does wonders to beat his man, and often embarrasses them, only to try the same slowly floated cross that is so easy to defend against.\n\nHe perhaps saw the benefit of a more traditional effort on 61 minutes, which allowed the 23-year-old to show the productive player he often promises to be.\n\nArsenal’s changes had admittedly ensured that they were starting to pen Brentford in, with Odegaard looking especially lively.\n\nIt was his pressing that forced Andrews’s backline into an error, the ball then arriving at the feet of Piero Hincapie. He hooked over a fine cross, although one where Madueke looked like he might have stepped forward a touch too early. It was instead Caoimhin Kelleher who was wrong-footed, although only because Madueke showed impressive agility.\n\nThe winger arched back to loop a header across the goal and into the bottom corner.\n\nThat should have been that, only for Odegaard to then look a bit more culpable at the other end. He only stuck his leg out for one of Brentford’s aerial assaults, allowing Lewis-Potter to plunder a brilliant header.\n\nArsenal were lucky not to concede from that route again.\n\nBrentford are more than just an awkward team, or a physical one. There’s so much calculation in everything they do, as befitting a modern club built on analytics. You can almost see the science behind every move, the manner in which the ball is played into areas of probability.\n\nA favoured attack is one of the wingers immediately playing a first-time ball across the opposition area on the break, which tends to instantly cause angst.\n\nArsenal had to be on their toes, from start to especially raucous finish. The end of the game had a lot of football in it, particularly in a helter-skelter stoppage time. David Raya had already offered one of the saves of the season from Igor Thiago and had to be constantly alert as a relentless Brentford just kept roaring forward. The home side could have won it at least twice in the closing stages, Arsenal once.\n\nThose late blocks may prove important to Arsenal in another way. It may end up a good point in the grander scheme of things. Rather than such one-off moments, though, Arteta and his staff will be looking at those two lost points.\n\nIf Arsenal wanted more, however, they should have done more.",

    "fullText": "Corinthians bounced back after their debut defeat in the Brasileirão.\n\nPlaying in front of their faithful fans for the first time in the competition, Timão defeated Red Bull Bragantino—who had been unbeaten so far this season—by 2-0 this Thursday (12th).\n\nThis victory came in the third round of the competition, witnessed by 26,985 fans at the Neo Química Arena.\n\nCorinthians had the most possession in the 1st half—about 70%.\n\nBut Dorival’s team wasted the few chances they created.\n\nFor example, the persistent Yuri Alberto lacked precision.\n\nMeanwhile, Red Bull Bragantino—superior for part of the first half—had more opportunities.\n\nBut they also failed to deliver when it came to finishing.\n\nGabriel Paulista, who scored the winning goal in the Supercopa Rei, was decisive again at two minutes into the second half, taking advantage of Garro’s set piece.\n\nVagner Mancini’s team had the chance to equalize at the 14-minute mark.\n\nBut Hugo Souza saved Pitta’s penalty kick.\n\nHis 11th penalty save for Corinthians.\n\nThe game remained open and, as a result, unpredictable.\n\nIt was up to Corinthians to capitalize with Matheus Bidu (30’).\n\nBut the best chance belonged to Timão, with Vitinho.\n\nCorinthians reached three points, leaving the bottom of the table after playing their second match.\n\nRed Bull Bragantino stayed at six, missing the chance to finish another round at the top.\n\nBoth teams now shift their focus to the Paulistão.\n\nThe final round of the group stage will take place on Sunday (15th).\n\nIn fifth place, Timão will visit São Bernardo (12th).\n\nAnd Massa Bruta (3rd) will host leaders Novorizontino.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "No. 23 BYU is off to a solid start and boasts a roster that includes 10 gymnasts who call Utah home. Next up is a showdown with the Red Rocks Friday night in Salt Lake City.",
    "fullText": "BYU’s gymnastics team is on an upward trajectory for what could be the Cougars’ best season to date. The team just recorded its highest score since the 2024 Big 12 championships in a 196.975-196.000 win over SUU on the road last week.\n\nThat effort included season highs on vault (49.15), beam (49.375) and floor (49.30). The event highs were a nice complement to bars, which has been the Cougars’ strongest event this year.\n\nBYU currently ranks No. 23 in the country and boasts a roster of 21 gymnasts, including 10 who call Utah home. Recruiting locally is nothing new for the Cougars, but there seems to be a momentum boost in recent years. That includes this year’s freshman class, which is arguably BYU’s most impressive.\n\n“I chose BYU because I’m not going to be doing gymnastics forever. This was an opportunity to be part of a program that is continually climbing and one that was going to help me grow outside of gymnastics, surrounded by good people.”\n\nBYU gymnast Scarlett Sonnenberg\n\nHighlighting that freshman class is Scarlett Sonnenberg from Springville, Utah. Sonnenberg came to BYU with a five-star rating and was recruited by several top-25 programs. She is only the second five-star recruit in the state since the ratings system began, the other being Utah gymnast Avery Neff, who is from South Jordan, Utah.\n\n“I think with the rating it is nice to know that I deserved it, that I got myself there and achieved something high,” said Sonnenberg. “But now, I’m really enjoying the team environment that everyone told me was a big change from club to college.\n\n“I chose BYU because I’m not going to be doing gymnastics forever. This was an opportunity to be part of a program that is continually climbing and one that was going to help me grow outside of gymnastics, surrounded by good people.”\n\nSonnenberg’s ability to compete against the best gymnasts during her club career, many of whom she’s still competing against across college meets, prepared her for the mental and physical load of a college season. She is a regular in the vault, beam and floor lineups and has taken on the tough assignment of leading off events in her debut year.\n\n“Scar is so talented,” said senior Kylie Eaquinto. “She’s been settling into the leadoff role for us on beam and floor, and she’s amazing.”\n\nEaquinto is another local product, who along with fellow Orem, Utah, native Brynlee Andersen-Broekman leads the Cougars. Both have already earned event titles this season as well as a Big-12 Weekly Award.\n\n“Kylie and Brynlee are both so talented,” said BYU coach Guard Young. “Every time I watch Kylie perform on bars, I’m just like, ‘How am I going to ever replace that.’\n\n“With Brynlee, if you ever just need something that makes you smile, watch her beam, she’s just a star,” said Young.\n\nAndersen-Broekman is so good on beam that she qualified for nationals last season as an individual competitor after tying for the event title at regionals (with Neff and others).\n\nShe has carried over her success this season, hitting a meet-high 9.925 on beam in the win over SUU. The junior is the highest-ranked beamer from the Big 12 in the national rankings, just ahead of her former club teammate and now Utah gymnast Camie Winger at No. 17 and 18, respectively.\n\nEaquinto leads a strong bars lineup for the Cougars, and has a new floor routine this season that fans love. It’s a baseball themed routine that is a tribute to her five brothers and their love for the sport.\n\n“It’s a very different vibe shift for me on floor — I never thought I would do something like this, but it’s been fun,” explained Eaquinto. “Finding music is my least favorite part of floor; I know some people love it, but I don’t. When the ”Centerfield\" song played, I was like, ‘This could be fun.’ It’s gotten me out of my comfort zone and been a nice tie to my brothers.”\n\nEaquinto, like Sonnenberg and other teammates, was also presented with multiple offers from college programs.\n\n“I really liked BYU because it was close to home so I could go home for Sunday dinners and because I could be surrounded by people who have the same beliefs and values as me,” explained Eaquinto. “It’s been fun to see past club teammates join the team and meet new teammates, and really watch the program grow.”\n\nSonnenberg, Eaquinto and Andersen-Broekman, among other Cougars, all trained at Bold Gymnastics in Utah County, which is owned by Utah gymnastics assistant coach Jimmy Pratt and his wife Makenna Pratt. Sophomore Deb Silva, from Lindon, Utah, is another local product out of Bold who just won the floor title with a 9.9 in the Cougars’ win last week.\n\nBold is one of several clubs in Utah, including Olympus Gymnastics, where Zoe Hale and Mya Kirkham trained prior to BYU, producing talented gymnasts. The sophomore Kirkham is fighting her way into Cougar lineups, while Hale, a four-star recruit, is part of the talented freshman class.\n\n“I think we have a really deep roster with a lot of talent coming from all over the country, and we also have a lot of talented local kids who want to compete close to home and go to an outstanding university,” said Young.\n\nUp next, BYU travels up the road to face No. 12 Utah this Friday in the Huntsman Center. The meet starts at 7 p.m. MST and is being aired on ESPN+.",

    "fullText": "The San Diego Padres have a new manager for the 2026 season, and if you ask Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, that seems likely to turn the temperature down a bit in the rivalry between the two teams.\n\nOn Thursday, as pitchers and catchers start reporting for spring training in Glendale, Arizona, Marty Caswell of Foul Territory noted Roberts has “butted heads with quite a few Padres managers” and asked him if he expects that to continue.\n\nIs Dave Roberts going to butt heads with Craig Stammen as he did Mike Shildt? pic.twitter.com/7W2brKEdVo\n\n— Marty Caswell (@MartyCaswell) February 12, 2026\n\nRoberts indicated he does not think that will be the case with Craig Stammen.\n\n“I’m not going to butt heads with Stammen,” Roberts said. “No way. I just don’t see that happening. Don’t see it happening.”\n\nCaswell referenced Roberts’ previous confrontations with the Padres, perhaps the most prominent of which occurred in June.\n\nRoberts was ejected from the June 17, 2025, game with the Padres after Shohei Ohtani was plunked in the leg with a fastball.\n\nThat struck batter came one inning after Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit, and Roberts confronted the umpire after he issued warnings to both teams.\n\nThree days later, Ohtani and Tatis were hit again, prompting the benches to clear.\n\nThat night, Roberts got into it with now-former Padres manager Mike Shildt, who later seemed to admit that Ohtani was hit in retaliation for the pitch that hit Tatis.\n\nDespite the friction with his predecessor, Roberts was complimentary of Stammen, noting that despite a lack of managerial experience, his San Diego counterpart is well-regarded in the baseball world.\n\nStammen spent the last six years of his career with the Padres, prompting the San Diego Union-Tribune to dub the move “outside the box but from inside the organization.”\n\n“I was surprised in the sense of, he hasn’t coached before, but not surprised with the respect he has in the clubhouse, the game, and being familiar with the organization. Great hire,” Roberts said.\n\nFor his part, Stammen has promised the Padres will be competitive with the Dodgers, which he described as a “great team.”\n\n“We’re going to compete,” Stammen told Foul Territory earlier this year. “No doubt about that. We’re going to give them our best shot. That’s what we’ll do every year, that’s what we’re going to do every year.",

    "description": "Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies.",
    "fullText": "Ring is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.\n\nThe partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"\n\nFlock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.\n\nRing's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nPrivacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters.\n\n\"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"\n\nFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.\n\nRing has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime.\n\nThe Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\"\n\nFlock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have increasingly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nRing spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live.\n\n\"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said.\n\nThe news was earlier reported by The Verge.",

    "fullText": "It’s been about a month since Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—an anti-vaccine activist and lawyer who has no background in medicine, health, or science—released dietary guidance for Americans. It’s going about as well as expected for a man who drinks raw milk, peddles beef tallow, swims in sewage-tainted water, and keeps roadkill meat in his freezer. That is to say, it’s going badly—so badly that even his favorite AI chatbot is openly defecting.\n\nOf course, this hasn’t slowed Kennedy. On Wednesday, he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins held an event in Washington, DC, to celebrate what they called the “implementation” of the dietary guidance, which is represented in an upside-down food pyramid—or a funnel.\n\nHowever, the event, which lasted about an hour, seemed mostly focused on honoring a commercial produced to promote the nutrition guidance and a new website showcasing it, RealFood.gov. That commercial, which aired during last weekend’s Super Bowl, featured tightly framed shots of world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who made stigmatizing remarks about how he felt “fat and nasty” earlier in life and consequently “just wanted to kill myself.” He went on to decry America’s “obese, fudgy” people and lambasted “processed food,” before eating an apple.\n\nTyson was the featured speaker at Wednesday’s event, appearing behind the podium for about two minutes at the end. The lineup also included the commercial’s director, Brett Ratner, who was pushed out of Hollywood over numerous sexual assault allegations but recently produced a documentary on Melania Trump. Also present was Joe Gebbia, a co-founder of Airbnb, who joined Elon Musk’s DOGE and was said to be the person behind the design of the food funnel and new website.\n\nRollins and Kennedy also spoke, standing beside large posters of themselves sporting facial tattoos matching Tyson’s. Kennedy began his remarks by proclaiming that “for the first time in our nation’s history, the federal government put real food at the center of the American diet and protein in the center of the American plate.”\n\nSome in the nutrition and health fields have supported Kennedy’s fight against ultra-processed foods. But the bulk of the changes Kennedy made to the dietary guidance and funnel representation relate to glorifying fat and protein, drawing criticism that the updates are harmful and lack supporting evidence.\n\nAmong the critics is a notable AI chatbot. Kennedy’s new website, RealFood.gov, prods users to “use AI to get real answers about real food.” Entering a question into a text box and clicking “ask” redirects users to Grok, Elon Musk’s AI tool that has been shown to generate child sexual abuse material.\n\nAs for Grok’s take on nutrition, its answers do indeed get real. In short, Grok indicates that Kennedy’s new nutrition guidelines are not based on high-quality evidence—which is true—and that Kennedy is not a reliable source of nutrition information. He is, in fact, not trustworthy on health information generally, according to the chatbot. And when Grok designed a daily meal plan to fit Kennedy’s food funnel, it subsequently admitted that the plan contained excessive amounts of saturated fat and protein while falling short of the recommended fiber intake, which Americans are generally already short on.\n\nWhen asked if Kennedy’s guidance is based on high-quality research, the chatbot says it’s a mixed bag. An emphasis on ” whole, minimally processed foods, increase[d] fruits/vegetables, choos[ing] whole grains, and sharply limit[ing] added sugars, highly processed foods, and sugary drinks, aligns well with a broad consensus in high-quality research,” Grok responded. But it also includes “hype around protein and saturated fats that goes beyond (or contradicts) the advisory committee’s evidence summary” and instead reflects “decisions by the administration,” the chatbot said.\n\nWhen asked to generate a generic daily meal plan based on Kennedy’s food funnel, Grok suggested:\n\nThe heavy emphasis on full-fat dairy, including butter, aligns with Kennedy’s rhetoric. But the written guidance actually maintains the long-standing recommendation that Americans limit their saturated fat (found at high levels in full-fat dairy) to less than 10 percent of their total calories. For a standard 2,000-calorie diet, that would be less than 22 grams a day. When asked if the generated menu adheres to that recommendation, Grok said no. In fact, based on the options, it could be more than double, potentially exceeding 50 grams.\n\nWhat about protein? That, too, is generally over the limit. Recommended protein intake varies depending on factors such as weight, age, exercise level, and pregnancy status. But a general recommendation has been to get 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, or about 0.36 grams per pound. Americans generally already meet this recommendation. Kennedy’s guidance increases protein to 1.2 to 1.6 g/kg (or about 0.54 to 0.72 g/lb).\n\nFor a 150-pound person, the old and new recommendations for daily protein are 54 g and 81 g–108 g, respectively. (The USDA has a calculator here for your own recommendations, which still uses the old protein recommendation.) Grok’s interpretation of Kennedy’s guidance produced a menu with up to 180 grams of protein per day.\n\nWhile the meal plan exceeded recommendations for saturated fat and protein, it fell short on fiber, a critical nutrient Americans already eat too little of. In fact, most Americans eat less than half of the recommended amount of fiber, which is found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans. The new guidance maintains daily fiber recommendations, which are generally 25 g for women and 38 g for men. But Grok’s “realistic” estimate for fiber in its meal plan had a range of 25 to 35 grams, falling short for men.\n\nOverall, Grok concluded that “based on extensive fact-checks and expert consensus, RFK Jr. is not a reliable source on health matters. His claims often lack evidence, promote distrust in institutions, and have led to harmful outcomes.”\n\nSo where does that leave Americans looking for trustworthy nutrition advice? Grok helpfully notes that “Many experts still prefer alternatives like Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate, which prioritizes plants more heavily and limits red meat/dairy based on extensive epidemiological data.”",

    "description": "Does AI have consciousness? The question opens a path to something more consequential — to the nature of consciousness itself, the cultural consequences of cheap intelligence, and to what actually becomes expensive when thinking becomes a service.",
    "fullText": "Does AI have consciousness? The question opens a path to something more consequential — to the nature of consciousness itself, the cultural consequences of cheap intelligence, and to what actually becomes expensive when thinking becomes a service.\n\nThe conversation below, in which a language model asked me questions, begins with a question about consciousness, moves through culture, and ends on practice. What ties these threads together is stratification — the idea that every level of human experience grows out of a deeper one, all the way down to a certain level zero that is neither an object nor a concept. With such a model one cannot explain consciousness, but one can point out which spaces certainly cannot be used to investigate it.\n\nWhere does your interest in whether AI has consciousness come from in the first place?\n\nFrom curiosity, but also from the mundane. I’m riding an elevator to the sixth floor of an office building in Wroclaw and I see a social-media recommendation: a teaser for an interview in which an expert claims that AI has consciousness.\n\nCuriosity swells, and right behind it — disagreement: I want to see what the authority means, but I already suspect there will be a confusion of levels.\n\nConfusion of levels — meaning what with what?\n\nAttributing the word “consciousness” to what is, at best, a proficient manipulation of concepts. There is reflection, there are analogies, there are layers of abstraction. Except that reflection is a situation in which one thought narrates another. An analogy is a sequence of thoughts whose “shape” resembles another sequence. Humans do this. A language model simulates it too. And it is nothing metaphysical yet. And it certainly is not introspection.\n\nSo what is introspection in your understanding, and why does it matter?\n\nIntrospection begins where thought ceases to be the ruler of the landscape and becomes one of the objects in the field of attention. We are able to notice a thought the way we notice the chill of wind on our face, or feel the weight of a pierogi digesting in our stomach. This is not a metaphor. It is the phenomenological dimension of the intellect. We don’t have to immediately follow the next thought that arrives to comment on the current one.\n\nThat sounds simple, but also a bit like a trick.\n\nIt’s not a trick. It is simply something subtle that easily escapes us, yet can give\nus a direct answer to the question of consciousness. There is a narrow passage where\nwe know only that something happened, something stirred, something emerged in our\ninner space. In that quantum we encounter what I call consciousness.\n\nIn Polish, my native language, the cognizant nature of this word is easy to see in\nits etymology: świadomość literally suggests a capacity (the suffix -ość) rooted\nin świad – the same root found in świadek, “a witness.” English takes a different\nroute. Consciousness comes from Latin con- (“together”) and scire (“to\nknow”). Early on it could carry the sense of “knowing together” – being privy to\nsomething shared, even a secret – and only later broadened into the modern meaning:\nknowing what is going on in one’s own mind.\n\nAnd here enters the paradox you want to leave open?\n\nYes. I know that in ordinary terms AI does not have consciousness understood personally. But I also know for certain that it does, when it is included in my field of attention. Just as a dental crown performs the function of being me — for me when I bite, and for others when I smile. Analogously, a language model extends my function of intellect. A tool may not be a source of experience, yet it can be assimilated — that is, included in what we colloquially call our person, tangentially our agency, and a little earlier: our presence.\n\nHow is the reader supposed to verify this? Is this an invitation to adopt some philosophy?\n\nQuite the opposite. At this point we don’t want philosophy, metaphysics, or even objective truth, because they would interfere with our “measurement.” Pause for a moment and feel that there is some thought about to appear. Don’t develop it, don’t correct it. What color does it have? What shape? Can you hear it? Does it propagate to other spaces of mind and feeling? What does it do in your body? Illuminate it with curiosity. Receive the thought with that attitude. Simply notice that a very basic process of becoming aware is taking place. That is the essential thing here, and the earlier questions may help keep you from being pulled too quickly into the reflexive thread summoned to answer.\n\nOn the internet we just as often encounter voices saying the opposite: “LLMs are just probability calculations.” What’s your take?\n\nThis is a cognitive bias dressed up as an explanation. When someone says “it’s just…,” they’re usually not proposing a theory — they’re proposing a reduction meant to close the topic. And reductions have the inconvenient property of working symmetrically.\n\nIf large language models are to be invalidated by “it’s just weights, switches, and calculations,” then you can equally say that the brain is “just neurons, neurotransmitters, and electrical impulses.” So what? It’s still a change of the level of description, not proof of the absence of intelligence.\n\nIn programming we have a term called “duck typing,” captured by the slogan: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.” It is a pragmatic way of determining that a given object can be used for a particular purpose. Instead of relying on a declaration, we examine its behavior, expressed for instance through methods with agreed-upon names (e.g. quack).\n\nAnalogously with LLMs and AI: if something behaves as though it were intelligent, then it is intelligent. Even if it is artificial. It has that quality, and even when it is a so-called philosophical zombie — that suffices, as long as we don’t introduce considerations about consciousness into the equation.\n\nBut on the topic of behavior, you hear that models operate on simulated associations, serving up the most probable sentence completions, rather than truly thinking.\n\nThis reminds me of the old trick: “don’t think of an elephant.” You already know what happens: the elephant walks onto the inner stage immediately, without asking permission.\n\nAnd that is exactly the small, everyday lesson: operating with concepts relies largely on associations. When we evaluate from the outside, mechanistically, there is no magic here. In the model you can see it plain as day, while in a human the same thing is hidden under the label of exceptionality.\n\nWhen reduction becomes the only language, it turns into a photocopy trying to explain another photocopy. A sequence of concepts tries to rule that another sequence of concepts is inferior, because it resides in a different medium and has a different source. And up to a point that makes sense. Reductions are necessary in engineering, but one must not mistake a reduction for an explanation. They are two different functions in the same system.\n\nWe can talk about the nature of thought and then notice that it differs in a human and is quite different in a version simulated by a computer, but on this matter the scientific method itself may reach its limits, because it was not designed to investigate the nature of things — it was designed to investigate their behaviors and the relationships between them. These are the so-called laws of nature.\n\nStudying thought under the assumption of objectivism is problematic, because the instrument used in the study will also be thought. This is already a bigger caliber than a photocopy. It is photographing a city panorama in order to discover how the camera is built on the inside. Some people can’t pull this off, and instead of reviewing the methodology, they photograph another camera. To justify the trick, they cite the fact that otherwise the film would be exposed.\n\nThere is also a “softer” way out of this dilemma – one I hinted at earlier. It\ndoesn’t require analysis, only a little slack: just take it easy,\nman. That simulated machine-thought\nbecomes my thought the moment it “enters” my head.\n\nBoth human and non-human thought is a tool. But for our relationship with our own\nthought to actually be that way, it’s not enough to merely think about it or to\nexpress such a will once. It can’t be achieved in the same place.\n\nYou said “tool.” OK. But how do you capture this more technically — so it doesn’t sound like a slogan?\n\nThis needs explanation, because it may not be obvious to everyone what I mean by “place” in this context. I’m reminded of the concept of stratified design from Abelson and Sussman (“MIT AI Memo 986”), where software is designed by distinguishing layers of abstraction, and the concretes from lower layers become the abstracts of higher layers. Those abstracts are again treated as concretes, and so on.\n\nFor example, you implement a point on a screen, then a segment (using the point), then a shape (using segments and points), and then a circle or a rectangle. Good stratification ensures that a small change in requirements translates into a small change in implementation. When you want to change the properties of a point as a building block of segments and further of shapes (say, by adding color to it), you only need to modify one construct.\n\nA note for programmers: I don’t simply mean dividing a problem into parts to avoid repetition and to maintain structure. I mean defining computations (e.g. as functions) that are then passed as input to other computations (e.g. higher-order functions).\n\nIt looks a bit as if you could replace the material that the walls of a building are made of without demolishing the whole structure — because you change the concrete (the pun is apt: in construction, concrete is the foundation material), and the abstracts that depend on it adjust on their own. That’s very powerful.\n\nHow does this connect with the role of thought as a tool?\n\nI have the impression that our structure of knowing is organized in a similarly layered way. Going from the top, we have the level of objective truth. That is the space where we talk to one another, trying to invoke science and tossing around arguments about whether AI thinks and whether it has consciousness. But this level doesn’t emerge from a vacuum. It is a subset of certain rigorous rules defining what we recognize as objective, or even scientific.\n\nYet when we look more closely, the concrete for this “objective world,” the soil from which it grows, is something broader: culture — the space that enables us as a community to agree on holding certain values. One such value for objective truth would be, for example, the requirement that for the same input conditions of an experiment, you get the same output, so that others can verify it.\n\nBut let’s go further. Culture cannot exist without its constituents — human individuals. It too grows out of something; something is its transmission medium. Its foundation is the personal layer, rooted in our motives, thoughts, impulses, and feelings.\n\nSo we’re circling back to consciousness?\n\nYes, although consciousness has another quality: it pierces through all these levels, seeing everything at once. It is not only the base, but also the capacity for “drilling holes through abstractions.”\n\nThat last phrase comes from software engineering. It denotes a situation where a stratified system allows direct access to concretes in order to handle edge cases. For example, someone might want to create a geometric shape composed of segments, but at the same time needs to influence the properties of a single point that is several levels away in the abstraction ladder. Well-designed stratification should allow skipping layers of feature reduction.\n\nComing back to the spheres of human experience. The personal layer is very close to us. Our relationships with people and objects, and even with our own thoughts, are anchored in it as a reference point. Yet it, too, is grounded in something still more basic: in the very sense of subjectivity. And suddenly those bodily signals, thoughts, and feelings — when we experience them — acquire the quality of being ours. We identify them as ours, and some of them as ourselves. We can do this because the sense of self as something distinct, separate — that is, a person (in Polish: osobny means “separate” and osoba means “person” — the shared root is no accident) — is in a way abstract, and therefore flexible, even though it seems concrete and stable.\n\nIs personhood a component of consciousness?\n\nIf we can, as before, perceive our own thoughts and other constituents that we identify as aspects of us, this gives us the recognition that consciousness is primary relative to all of it — even the personal. Eventually we arrive at the very sense of being oneself, which too can be noticed.\n\nThis is where things get genuinely interesting, because if subjectivity is being observed, then the division between the outer and inner landscape starts to wobble. This is the moment when we can no longer say that we “have” consciousness, or even that we are it, because these are impressions of a subject that is itself encompassed by consciousness. What remains is the bare process of witnessing.\n\nWe can provisionally call this level zero. The concrete from which abstracts arise: from the personal, through the interpersonal and cultural, all the way up to the so-called objective. The apparent glitch in this representation is that we usually associate a concrete with something material, tangible — and here we cannot apply that. The most concrete thing is simultaneously the most devoid of features!\n\nWhen we try to understand consciousness, do we start from the world and go inward — or start from the center and go toward the world? What breaks when we pick the wrong direction?\n\nThat’s a good question, because it touches the distinction between epistemology and ontology. The first asks “how”: how do we arrive at knowledge, how do we agree on what is true, how do we verify. The second examines the nature of things, asks “what is it.” The problem of somehow grasping consciousness is above all an ontological problem, but the human mind — accustomed to operating in epistemic mode — tries to capture it in its own way, and fails.\n\nThe capacity for experience is the background in which measurements, models, language, and agreements about what we consider true appear in the first place. Before we know anything through thought, something is already experiencing it. A vector set up so that thought, under the rigor of objectivism, will try to explain consciousness, will direct it toward the so-called hard problem of consciousness — a gap that cannot be bridged, because the investigative instrument (thought) is a derivative of what is supposed to be the object of investigation.\n\nIf level zero is by definition not an object, but rather something in which the feeling of objecthood can arise in the first place, then objectively there is nothing to study. It is not a conventional phenomenon; at both the sensory and rational level, it does not exist.\n\nReversing the vector of inquiry seems like a practical option. The catch is that it’s hard and uncertain, because no freely available, worldview-neutral disciplines have been developed that would be interested in this kind of exploration. There have been exceptions, though. Francisco Varela, for instance, tried to connect the two orders — “scientific mode” and first-person witnessing — not in order to mystify, but to recover concretes that analysis typically discards. Earlier still, Plotinus proposed the concept of the One, which hopefully won’t be offended if we call it consciousness.\n\nThe formulation that AI has consciousness but simultaneously doesn’t have it stops being strange and paradoxical the moment we loosen the abstracts and allow ourselves to sink to level zero.\n\nNow that we’ve put level zero on the table as the foundation and we see that objectivity is just one of the abstraction layers — what, in your view, happens in the life of a community when a person (or institution) starts treating that topmost layer as the only truth, while in practice being driven by impulses: fear, prestige, the need for dominance or belonging?\n\nIf the higher layers detach from level zero, the intellect becomes an excellent PR agent: it can justify any decision and protect any fabricated identity. And then the community gets elegant arguments instead of genuine contact.\n\nThis is especially visible when someone very intelligent uses the intellect from base motives: to maintain belonging, win status, or gain advantage at others’ expense. This isn’t a triumph of reason — it is more like autoimmunity: higher functions start working against the whole, because they lose contact with level zero, with the very space of becoming aware.\n\nThis is almost a description of the shallow meritocracy that defines contemporary metropolitan life. In theory we delegate decision-making to “smart” people, but in practice whether someone belongs to the caste that uses intelligence depends on social surroundings and origin, and indirectly on wealth.\n\nSince today’s “intelligence caste” in practice is often a function of networks and wealth, how do you see AI’s impact on this arrangement: will cheap, easily accessible intelligence work like free education and level the playing field — or rather like a new form of capital that can be bought in a premium version, thus deepening the divide even further?\n\nFirst, AI can help us notice that the intellect is nothing special, because it objectifies it — detaches it from the person.\n\nSecond, in the spread of artificial intelligence I see both a certain threat and an opportunity for social change. Perhaps let’s start with the negative scenario: the feudalization of intelligence.\n\nFeudalization is a strong word. What do you mean?\n\nWhat is the good that becomes the gateway in this new feudalism?\n\nIn the information society, the highest good is knowledge. In the post-information era, I believe it will be cognitive comfort. Not knowledge in the schoolbook sense, but the ability not to be constantly on the verge of overload. You buy correction loops: mistake-fix. You also buy peace, because the system runs dozens of iterations for you, and you see the distillate.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nWork. Two people do similar things, have similar competences and intentions. One has purchased “premium intelligence” — better models, better tools, better quotas, better infrastructure. The other has only herself.\n\nIt’s not that the first one is “smarter.” It’s that she has resilience against failure: she closes loops faster, returns to equilibrium faster, draws conclusions faster, because the cost of error is lower for her. The other has to pay for the same mistakes with her own time, sleep, and tension.\n\nThat sounds like another arms race.\n\nAnd it somewhat is, because somewhere a simple mechanism lurks: those who can’t find the capital to “buy intelligence” may be pushed to the margins. This doesn’t have to look like dramatic violence. It’s enough that some are architects, while others execute others’ decisions. Or worse: there even are no architects.\n\nYou could say that’s already the case now: some decide, others must execute. Yes, but in the age of intellect-as-commodity the perception of this problem will sharpen, which may lead to friction. Today you can rationalize that someone is in a worse position because they weren’t smart enough. In the future that will be harder.\n\nIf models are supposed to democratize, where does this shadow come from?\n\nFrom the economics of access. Today we are quite naturally shifting toward subscription plans instead of products, and along with that toward the vendor lock-in mechanism: you get used to a particular way of thinking and a particular provider. That’s comfortable. And comfort, as we know, is often the first step toward dependency.\n\nIs there an antidote, or just a diagnosis?\n\nThere is. And it already exists — it only requires that we see it as a culture, not just a technical solution.\n\nThe antidote to the feudalization of intelligence is open models, community models — the kind you can run, inspect, combine, copy, federate. In short: free software and gift culture transposed into the domain of so-called artificial intelligence, seasoned with the benefit of decentralization.\n\nThen instead of solitary agents, we have a swarm.\n\nYou say “swarm.” What does that actually mean?\n\nA swarm is infrastructure: every node contributes something (data, feedback, time, capabilities, tests, audit), and in return everyone gets access to agency without the mechanism of lock-in to a single provider. This isn’t a promise of paradise, but a mechanism for leveling the playing field.\n\nI imagine it like this: thousands of small instances — tools, agents, models — that are not obedient to one corporate morality and one price list, but are maintained like an ecosystem. Sometimes it will be imperfect, sometimes chaotic, but it will be alive and evolving.\n\nAnd where is the human in this? After all, we’re talking about intelligence, not politics.\n\nPrecisely because we’re talking about intelligence, we’re talking about politics. Intelligence — biological or artificial — in practice means power over time, attention, and decisions. And therefore, in consequence, over relationships and ultimately over the fate of those who become dependent on us.\n\nAnd here is a simple criterion: community comes first. Not because the individual doesn’t matter, but because if differences in wealth become differences in dignity, then even individual victories will be won on scorched earth.\n\nIt’s not a slogan against anyone, just a reminder that in the age of cheap intelligence, what’s truly costly becomes something else: access to agency without the loss of freedom.\n\nWhen intelligence becomes a service, freedom — as always — begins with whether we can co-create that service, not merely consume it.\n\nIn the post-information era we will have to find ways to cope with the polyversality of messaging that we are already experiencing more frequently today, and to develop a healthy response to the dethronement of the intellect as the distinguishing trait of humanity.\n\nMoreover, as a result of this devaluation, trust in so-called objective truth as the only legitimate path for settling questions of meaning will most likely weaken.\n\nI propose two provisional, hypothetical stances that may help restore balance in a social reality where there is no single correct version of truth. I call them the craft of truth and perspective engineering.\n\nYou talk about “the craft of truth” and “perspective engineering.” It sounds like two slogans, but I sense it’s one machine. How do you put it together?\n\nFor me these are two levels of the same remedy.\n\nPerspective engineering is the tool: integrating viewpoints so they fit the problem and conditions, instead of pretending that one perspective always wins.\n\nAnd the craft of truth is the direction: it starts with introspection, with the ability to see what inside me wants to win before I start rationalizing it. Then post-truth becomes something that transcends truth, rather than merely negating it.\n\nSo truth as a practice, not as a declaration?\n\nYes. And this practice has an entry condition. Honesty with oneself is the precondition for a correct feedback loop; without it the cultural community has nothing on which to build responsibility. If I don’t see what drives me, I can have the most elegant arguments in the world and I’ll still be using them to service something personal: fear, the need for recognition, or the desire for control.\n\nAnd where is the place for the intellect? Because from the start you’ve sounded as if you were dethroning it.\n\nI dethrone it only as the central seat of consciousness in the colloquial sense, but this has downstream consequences for its role in the higher layers. As a tool it is excellent. The problem begins when it becomes the sole advisor and — socially — a carrier of prestige, or a justification for influence detached from actually improving one’s surroundings. Then it is easy to believe that if someone is brilliant, they are automatically trustworthy — and that is a category error. The intellect can serve truth just as well as it can serve dysfunction or even pathology.\n\nDo you have a concrete example? Something so it’s not purely about ethics in the abstract.\n\nI have a positive, mundane example from the creative craft that is programming. In the past, when I entered a software project, I would land in delivery mode: hours of translating intention into text and code, then tests, documentation, painstaking validation. That’s important, but it is also the moment where a person easily confuses the tension of focus with moral value. The mind is cyclically mobilized because “it finally works!,” while the body long ago wanted to step down from combat readiness.\n\nLet’s recall the stratification of the system: this change in the organism’s condition and well-being involuntarily propagates to the higher layers, and eventually affects others, culture, and — cumulatively, multiplied by the number of participants in a given community — the prevailing understanding of truth, beauty, or good. It is a larger feedback loop, because then the same environment gives it back to us with interest. So we don’t want to damage the environment so that it treats us to ever-worsening conditions, like cyberspace feeding synthetic content to degrading models. That is how it practically connects.\n\nComing back to coding. Today AI already takes over part of that load: it can relieve me of the necessary but non-creative work of converting intention into form. And here a shift happens that interests me the most:\n\nI stop delivering lines of code,\nI start delivering intention.\n\nWhat matters more becomes why I’m doing something and whom it serves. The intellect returns to its place as a tool, not as an identity.\n\nBut isn’t that a risk of going soft? If you have validations “on demand,” then why do you need your own falsification?\n\nIt depends on the domain. In the technical space the validator is merciless: something works or it doesn’t. In soft domains it’s harder. That’s why in perspective engineering the key thing for me is a practical criterion: before I accept something as sensible, I look for independent sources and check the quality of the evidence. Meta-analyses, samples, context of the authors, compatibility with experience, but also whether a given view is merely an attractive narrative.\n\nAnd it is here that AI can shorten the distance from intention to form. Thanks to that, I have more attentional resources for meaning, for relationships, for course correction. This isn’t handing over the wheel — it is reclaiming space.\n\nAll right. But what does this change culturally? What’s in it for the community?\n\nIf thinking becomes a service, then what’s scarce changes. In the world of cheap intelligence, the ability to tolerate discomfort and course-correct — that is, responsibility — becomes more expensive. And then the carrier of rank becomes intention rather than efficiency. Not in the sense of a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: what do you choose? what do you omit? whom is it meant to serve? what price do you accept, and what price no longer?\n\nThis is the main turn for me: less “who is right,” and more “who can answer the call of the situation without deceiving themselves and without trampling others.”\n\nAnd what is the significance of this discomfort?\n\nIt’s a shorthand. The point is that in practice, tolerance of a certain level of discomfort translates into the ability for introspection, and thus into inner honesty, which is the precondition for correcting beliefs or behaviors. When some facade falls away, for some people that means confronting false beliefs about themselves, and that always carries a certain dose of natural discomfort understood very organically, as a passing psychic tension.\n\nYou keep bringing up intention as a force organizing the system, not a moral label. If you had to show in one image how the structure of financing can distort intentions.\n\nWe can imagine a situation: someone builds a social-media platform, and after years it turns out that its design harms users’ psyches. It promotes harmful content to attract attention. Otherwise revenue drops and investors stop funding the project. Not because the creators “wanted evil.” More often because they felt an inner deficiency and poverty, and later also because the company grew from a dozen people to hundreds or thousands, and by going public acquired an obligation to increase profits. Then profit became the highest good. This shows intention precisely not as a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: the funding structure rewards profit, and profit can distort intentions even without explicit will to harm.\n\nAs I’m answering this question, a lawsuit has just been filed in the US against social media platform owners for causing psychological harm. A user identified by the initials KGM alleges that when she used the platforms as a child, the content presented to her negatively affected her well-being, contributing among other things to anxiety disorders and suicidal thoughts.\n\nHow can AI help solve this problem?\n\nIt’s already happening. I increasingly see LLMs beginning to displace the internet’s know-it-alls — those we once followed because they had an opinion on every topic and always sounded confident. What’s more, in certain areas they are even replacing close ones or friends, especially where sensitive things are involved: shame, fear, guilt, ambiguous motives. This is practical, because the model is available instantly, but it is also culturally significant: if the user shifts attention from the feed of a social medium to a conversation, the attention economy changes.\n\nI suspect this must now be causing concern wherever attention is currency: in the marketing departments of social media platforms that for years designed their architecture so that we would come back to them for emotional stimulation, not for genuine self-understanding.\n\nIn a conversation with a model, part of the social stakes disappears. You don’t have to win in front of an audience, don’t have to defend your image, don’t have to manage belonging to a clan — which in social media activates almost automatically. This creates what I would call a safer field.\n\nThe internet shortened social distance by letting us meet people from the other side of the world who think similarly. But AI shortens it differently: it gives access to rare perspectives without the need to seek out their carriers. It is like a cultural condensate — a sample that can intrigue you, name an experience. You don’t have to make mistakes and backtrack when you realize that the perspective you adopted isn’t actually compatible with your character, doesn’t serve it. It saves time.\n\nBut there is also potential for more fundamental shifts.\n\nIn the optimistic scenario, the cultural change initiated by AI may shift the emphasis toward intention. And by that I don’t mean only the pious wishes connected with the social effect of dethroning the intellect — though those too — but very practical scenarios.\n\nIf “cheap intelligence” lowers the barrier to entry, pluralism emerges: more small platforms, more niche communities, more alternatives. Then user well-being can become more important than investor profit — not because of a conversion of corporatism, but because competition grows. And the axis of that competition, once intermediaries are cut short, is precisely intention.\n\nFurther, if pluralism is to be the remedy, a new organ of orientation must also emerge. Because in a polyversal world, the problem isn’t the lack of information but its excess. And here AI can step into a role that sounds modest but is crucial: an intention filter on the user’s side.\n\nI imagine agents working for users: not as sole advisors, but as guides through the thicket. A swarm of tools that examines the properties of a system (a platform, a community, a source), and knowing your values and needs suggests: “this will strengthen you,” “this will unsettle you,” “this is clever but feeds on emotions.”\n\nThe condition for honesty is simple: the agent must be able to say why it filters that way. What criteria did it adopt? What is its interest and how is it meant to serve us? Without that, the filter becomes just another form of propaganda.\n\nIf such a swarm is only supposed to filter and suggest, then where in your view does the boundary lie between a guide through culture and someone who co-creates that culture — and what happens when we start blurring that boundary?\n\nAI doesn’t create culture directly; it doesn’t introduce novelty — at least not yet. We might have that impression, because there has never before been a moment in history when a single person conversed with an averaged billion people compressed into a single shape.\n\nBesides, even the best agent is a filter and an amplifier: it can help select, but it doesn’t itself bear consequences on the other side of the relationship. And culture is precisely that network of consequences.\n\nYou say AI “doesn’t create” culture. That sounds like a provocation. What do you mean?\n\nWhen we look at this systemically, LLMs and diffusion models are not a new “author of culture” in the primary sense. They perform a lossy compression of existing human artifacts — language, images, thinking habits — into a digitally represented multidimensional space in which one can conveniently interpolate between points. It is like a shared dictionary, but written not in definitions, but in weights and statistics.\n\nAnd what happens when such a mechanism becomes a tool of everyday use?\n\nIn culture, three things start happening at once: averaging, colonialism, and the disappearance of detail.\n\nLet’s start with averaging. Why does this matter culturally at all?\n\nModels are trained to minimize errors. And in practice, an “error” is often whatever deviates from the pattern: the strange, the sharp, the unpredictable, the style-breaking. During fine-tuning (e.g. RLHF), extremes are naturally smoothed out. This has a clear advantage — less violence, less toxicity — but a side effect is that it cuts out some of the “high cultural frequencies”: genius, risk, madness, non-obviousness, absurdity, and fresh paradox.\n\nThe aesthetic turns beige. Prose becomes smooth, poetry bland, morality proper. This isn’t the result of bad will, but rather of the objective function: when everyone plugs into the same smoothing tool, the system’s variance drops. And culture lives precisely on variance, on entropy. And by culture I don’t mean just art or convention, but the clouds of values we absorb by being among others, which influence how we think and behave. These values are transmitted above all by example, not by readings or works of art.\n\nYou say “colonialism.” Sounds like a heavy accusation.\n\nIt is more a description of the mechanism of training networks and parameterizing them. A model’s weights are frozen decisions about what is “typical,” “beautiful,” “professional,” “normal.” When you ask a model for a “beautiful house” or an “elegant outfit,” you get an answer that isn’t neutral. It is statistical — and therefore culturally embedded in the data the model was trained on. If Western and Anglophone perspectives dominate, then local nuances become noise that the filter discards.\n\nWhat’s most dangerous about this?\n\nHidden power, but sewn in deeper than in movies or advertisements, because it is built into the tool with which a person thinks and creates. You don’t have to convince anyone; it’s enough that the result is easier, faster, and looks better. You can have something instantly, but when you’re not attentive and precise, you pay for it with conformism.\n\nAnd the disappearance of detail? That already sounds quite technical.\n\nYes, and that’s exactly why it is insidious — unnoticeable immediately, only after a longer time. The internet is being flooded with synthetic content, and new models are beginning to learn from data generated by old models. It is a photocopy of a photocopy: with each cycle we lose details, deviations, anomalies — the fuel of innovation.\n\nCan this be named more precisely?\n\nOne can speak in the language of entropy in the information-theoretic sense: if rare signals disappear from circulation, the distribution becomes more predictable, and the model increasingly proposes what already was. Digital culture, like Ouroboros, begins to eat its own tail. But it is worth mentioning the curious fact that entropy can also be understood existentially…\n\nIn considerations about consciousness? Being?\n\nIndeed. In Shannon’s framework, entropy is a measure of uncertainty in a signal; less entropy means greater predictability. But in considerations about consciousness, one also encounters the intuition that less “cognitive noise” can correlate with a greater sense of meaning. Bernardo Kastrup favors this line of thinking: when the narrative, or even broadly the epistemic apparatus of the mind quiets down, experience can become more coherent, even though it is poorer in content as measured by neural activity. The habit of incessant self-commentary weakens — the same one that neuroscience associates with the default mode network — and an experience of “meaning without description” appears.\n\nYes. In this arrangement, the human ceases to be merely a craftsman of text. They begin to serve as a source of entropy — not in the sense of chaos, but in the sense of novelty. AI excels at interpolation. It is worse at extrapolation, at going beyond the map. A biological, sentient subject — rooted in pain, joy, absurdity, and relationship — can inject into the system something that isn’t just another version of the same.\n\nIn the age of a cultural low-pass filter, anomalies become a precious resource.\n\nThe interview above was conducted with me by the language model GPT-5.2, which asked me several hundred questions, of which 20% required longer answers expressing opinions, while the rest were multiple-choice tests designed to sequence threads and clarify ambiguous statements.\n\nWhere a sentence had syntactic or stylistic flaws and needed correction (approx. 3% of the text), the model drew on a previously created idiolectal profile of my person containing approximately 250 dimensions characterizing my writing style and communication patterns. The profile was based on a prior analysis of approximately 1,500 machine pages of materials I had written, as well as on our earlier conversations.\n\nEditorial review before publication was carried out by Claude Opus 4.6.",

It’s time to consider not just human visitors, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens. Markdown for Agents automatically converts any HTML page requested from our network to markdown.",
    "fullText": "The way content and businesses are discovered online is changing rapidly. In the past, traffic originated from traditional search engines, and SEO determined who got found first. Now the traffic is increasingly coming from AI crawlers and agents that demand structured data within the often-unstructured Web that was built for humans.\n\nAs a business, to continue to stay ahead, now is the time to consider not just human visitors, or traditional wisdom for SEO-optimization, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens.\n\nFeeding raw HTML to an AI is like paying by the word to read packaging instead of the letter inside. A simple ## About Us on a page in markdown costs roughly 3 tokens; its HTML equivalent – <h2 class=\"section-title\" id=\"about\">About Us</h2> – burns 12-15, and that's before you account for the <div> wrappers, nav bars, and script tags that pad every real web page and have zero semantic value.\n\nThis blog post you’re reading takes 16,180 tokens in HTML and 3,150 tokens when converted to markdown. That’s a 80% reduction in token usage.\n\nMarkdown has quickly become the lingua franca for agents and AI systems as a whole. The format’s explicit structure makes it ideal for AI processing, ultimately resulting in better results while minimizing token waste.\n\nThe problem is that the Web is made of HTML, not markdown, and page weight has been steadily increasing over the years, making pages hard to parse. For agents, their goal is to filter out all non-essential elements and scan the relevant content.\n\nThe conversion of HTML to markdown is now a common step for any AI pipeline. Still, this process is far from ideal: it wastes computation, adds costs and processing complexity, and above all, it may not be how the content creator intended their content to be used in the first place.\n\nWhat if AI agents could bypass the complexities of intent analysis and document conversion, and instead receive structured markdown directly from the source?\n\nCloudflare's network now supports real-time content conversion at the source, for enabled zones using content negotiation headers. Now when AI systems request pages from any website that uses Cloudflare and has Markdown for Agents enabled, they can express the preference for text/markdown in the request. Our network will automatically and efficiently convert the HTML to markdown, when possible, on the fly.\n\nHere’s how it works. To fetch the markdown version of any page from a zone with Markdown for Agents enabled, the client needs to add the Accept negotiation header with text/markdown as one of the options. Cloudflare will detect this, fetch the original HTML version from the origin, and convert it to markdown before serving it to the client.\n\nHere's a curl example with the Accept negotiation header requesting a page from our developer documentation:\n\nOr if you’re building an AI Agent using Workers, you can use TypeScript:\n\nWe already see some of the most popular coding agents today – like Claude Code and OpenCode – send these accept headers with their requests for content. Now, the response to this request is formatted  in markdown. It's that simple.\n\nNote that we include an x-markdown-tokens header with the converted response that indicates the estimated number of tokens in the markdown document. You can use this value in your flow, for example to calculate the size of a context window or to decide on your chunking strategy.\n\nHere’s a diagram of how it works:\n\nDuring our last Birthday Week, Cloudflare announced Content Signals — a framework that allows anyone to express their preferences for how their content can be used after it has been accessed.\n\nWhen you return markdown, you want to make sure your content is being used by the Agent or AI crawler. That’s why Markdown for Agents converted responses include the Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes header signaling that indicates content can be used for AI Training, Search results and AI Input, which includes agentic use. Markdown for Agents will provide options to define custom Content Signal policies in the future.\n\nCheck our dedicated Content Signals page \n\nWe enabled this feature in our Developer Documentation and our Blog, inviting all AI crawlers and agents to consume our content using markdown instead of HTML.\n\nTry it out now by requesting this blog with Accept: text/markdown.\n\nIf you’re building AI systems that require arbitrary document conversion from outside Cloudflare or Markdown for Agents is not available from the content source, we provide other ways to convert documents to Markdown for your applications:\n\nWorkers AI AI.toMarkdown() supports multiple document types, not just HTML, and summarization.\n\nBrowser Rendering /markdown REST API supports markdown conversion if you need to render a dynamic page or application in a real browser before converting it.\n\nAnticipating a shift in how AI systems browse the Web, Cloudflare Radar now includes content type insights for AI bot and crawler traffic, both globally on the AI Insights page and in the individual bot information pages.\n\nThe new content_type dimension and filter shows the distribution of content types returned to AI agents and crawlers, grouped by MIME type category.\n\nYou can also see the requests for markdown filtered by a specific agent or crawler. Here are the requests that return markdown to OAI-Searchbot, the crawler used by OpenAI to power ChatGPT’s search:\n\nThis new data will allow us to track the evolution of how AI bots, crawlers, and agents are consuming Web content over time. As always, everything on Radar is freely accessible via the public APIs and the Data Explorer.\n\nTo enable Markdown for Agents for your zone, log into the Cloudflare dashboard, select your account, select the zone, look for Quick Actions and toggle the Markdown for Agents button to enable. This feature is available today in Beta at no cost for Pro, Business and Enterprise plans, as well as SSL for SaaS customers.\n\nYou can find more information about Markdown for Agents on our Developer Docs. We welcome your feedback as we continue to refine and enhance this feature. We’re curious to see how AI crawlers and agents navigate and adapt to the unstructured nature of the Web as it evolves.",

    "fullText": "We've decided that AI makes us dumb, brainrot is real, and we're all forgetting how to write code.\n\nThis was my initial assumption, too.\n\nBut I've come to see things a little differently.\n\nI actually think the opposite is happening.\n\nThe idea that we're all forgetting to write code is true, but misses the much bigger and more important point.\n\nYes, we are losing those reflexes for manual coding just like our ancestors lost the reflex for spear fishing or pottery.\n\nBut did society regress just because our ancestors forgot how to spear fish?\n\nA more recent example is the early-early days of programming. There used to be people who knew how to program in assembly, and yes, I know some people still take pride in this, but realistically? We have collectively forgotten how to write assembly — yet society moves forward faster than ever.\n\nI believe the same is happening today. We're forgetting to write manually, write with pen and paper, and to code by hand. But that is ok.\n\nOn the other side of things, I feel my brain getting sharper, not duller, from having constant access to information.\n\nAt any moment of any day, I can now open my phone and find an answer to any question. And not only can I get instant access to information — I can ask for corrections and feedback on my world view — my mental model of how things work.\n\nI think this is the real, insane superpower of AI that nobody is talking about. AI can give us extremely precise information to patch up gaps in our knowledge, allowing every person to have a more complete and accurate world view.\n\nAt the same time, it does require thought because AI is frequently wrong and hallucinates, so the user must actually engage with the AI and think critically.\n\nKnowing what questions to ask and how to ask them is becoming an ever more important skill. What started out as \"prompt engineering\"— has quietly become a generalized skill of extreme intellectual precision via language. Millions of people are now practicing the art of saying exactly what they mean, every single day.\n\nMy ability to refine specific language around asking questions has dramatically improved, as has my ability to detect weird information that feels wrong or out of place. I'm constantly pushing back on the AI and disagreeing with it.\n\nAll of this said, there are still major problems with hallucinations and sycophancy which are unresolved, and which pose major threats.\n\nStories of AI psychosis are concerning and must be explored.\n\nBut the one thing that I am thoroughly convinced of is that those who choose to use AI to expand and deepen their thinking will receive a massive cognitive boost and form a more complete mental model of how the world works.\n\nIn a sense, I think of AI as a curiosity multiplier — but this requires a baseline level of curiosity to multiply.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan is consolidating power to move faster on AI.\n\nThe bank is reshuffling its commercial and investment bank to \"maximize the impact of AI,\" according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider that was sent this week.\n\nThe firm has named Guy Halamish as the chief operating officer of the CIB and tasked him with overseeing the ongoing effort to \"harness the power of our data and fully leverage rapidly evolving AI capabilities,\" the memo, signed by the CIB's co-CEOs, Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh, said. Halamish's new role was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nUnder the new structure, each major business in the division, including banking, markets, payments, and securities services, will have its own chief data and analytics officer reporting jointly to Halamish and business heads. The bank recently hired Zachery Anderson as the chief data and analytics officer of its payments division, after a nearly six-year stint at UK-based lender NatWest. In a LinkedIn post about the new job, Anderson said he wants to push the \"edge of the possible with AI.\"\n\nThe move is part of a new strategy to break silos across the unit and speed up adoption of AI.\n\nThe team of officers will work with the wider firm on a range of efforts, including \"preparing our infrastructure for more advanced AI and the expanded use of AI agents\" and \"driving end-to-end transformation\" in areas such as client onboarding.\n\nThe CIB is a huge profit driver for JPMorgan — in 2024, it generated $25 billion in net income out of a firmwide total of $58.5 billion, according to that year's annual report.\n\nJPMorgan, backed last year by an approximately $18 billion tech budget, is one of the financial industry's leaders in AI, with its own proprietary genAI platform and additional tools in the pipeline. CEO Jamie Dimon defended the firm's AI spending on a recent earnings call.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the spending.\n\nWork at JPMorgan or have a tip?

    "title": "I visited Polymarket's free grocery store. It was more impressive than Kalshi's similar stunt.",
    "description": "Polymarket's pop-up offered a polished experience, with attendees allowed to take as many free groceries as they could fit in a branded tote bag.",
    "fullText": "Free groceries in New York? It feels like an impossibility — and yet, I saw it twice in two weeks.\n\nIt's all thanks to a good old-fashioned marketing battle.\n\nPrediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi are in a two-week grocery war, both propping up short-term free supermarket stunts in New York. Last week, Kalshi took over a Westside Market for a day. On Thursday, Polymarket debuted its own store.\n\nI stepped inside the store two hours before it officially opened as part of a press preview. The store was pristine, unmarked by the what I assume would be the rampant foot traffic that would soon occupy it.\n\nIt looked like a miniaturized Trader Joe's.\n\nThe experience also seemed more planned out than Kalshi's similar marketing stunt. While Kalshi took over an existing supermarket for one day, offering $50 in free groceries, Polymarket designed its own pop-up scheduled to be open for five days (though free groceries will only be available on three of those days — more on that later).\n\nPolymarket is also accepting community donations for local charities, and donated $1 million to Food Bank for NYC.\n\nI came out impressed — even if it was a week behind its competitor. Here's what I saw.\n\nI arrived at The Polymarket (get it?) at 11:30 a.m., a half hour before the originally planned opening time of noon. (The company later pushed it back to 2 p.m., confusing some attendees.) The front of the shop was a circus of organizers, media, and everyday rubberneckers.\n\nNew York establishments love to call themselves the \"first\" or the \"best.\" Is The Polymarket really New York's \"first free grocery store\"? Likely not, especially if you count the hundreds of food pantries across the city.\n\nI chatted with some folks in line, including Milla Jackson, a school aide from Staten Island. On hour four of her wait, she was grateful for her warm winter jacket.\n\nJackson heard about the pop-up in the newsletter \"NYC for Free.\" She spotted some olive oil inside that she was excited to pick up.\n\n\"I just found out about Polymarket,\" she said. \"I looked it up last night. I'm like, 'Oh, I definitely want to show up.'\"\n\nVictoria Plaza was around Grand Central Terminal when Polymarket announced the location on social media. She expected that those ahead of her had been in the neighborhood.\n\nThe financial planning advisor came mostly out of curiosity. What would she take inside? \"Whatever I can carry,\" she said.\n\nAt 34° and sunny, Polymarket got lucky with a nicer opening day than Kalshi. They also handed out hot drinks (which Kalshi had) and put up heat lamps (which Kalshi did not have).\n\nA few minutes before making it inside, a man stationed his ladder on the front door and began painting over one of the Polymarket signs. No one seemed to know why.\n\nFor those seeking out free groceries, Polymarket will offer them up on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. Those days also have community donation hours.\n\nSaturday is Valentine's Day, when The Polymarket will have a \"community celebration\" with free flowers and cards. Monday is the final day for donations.\n\nInside the store, there were several framed notices that our movements would be filmed. It was a reminder: as much as The Polymarket is about free groceries, it's also about a marketing stunt.\n\nNo, you can't roll up to The Polymarket with a huge trash bag and clear off all the shelves. There are unsurprisingly some limits.\n\nAt Kalshi's pop-up, it was a cost ceiling: no more than $50 worth of goods. At the expensive Westside Market, $50 meant only a few items.\n\nAt The Polymarket, it's a constraint of physical space. Attendees get one branded tote bag and can leave with as much as it will fit.\n\nThe Polymarket focused on pantry staples. Oil, rice, seasonings, peanut butter, beans, the list goes on. There were no fancy premade meals, like at the Kalshi pop-up.\n\nI also noticed more branding at Polymarket's pop-up than at Kalshi's. Here's a digital sign advertising Polymarket above the gluten-free pasta. The flowers were wrapped in Polymarket-branded tissue.\n\nCarrots, avocados, bell peppers, you name it. The Polymarket put produce front and center. They looked idyllic in their wooden crates — though I'm not sure how long that sheen will last after the public opening.\n\nThe Kalshi grocery store was swarmed with crypto influencers and online betters. While that crowd hadn't yet arrived at The Polymarket from what I could see, there were some signs of an overly online presence. The fridges were stocked with Logan Paul's Prime Energy, for example.\n\nMost of the items in The Polymarket were fairly low-cost, though they all had name brands. One exception: the butter. Kerrygold is expensive! I was surprised to see a fridge full of them, ready for the taking.\n\nSocks are often the most requested items at homeless shelters. That's especially true in the cold, cold winter. It was a nice touch to see a shelf full of them.\n\nLeaving The Polymarket, I thought it was better planned out than Kalshi's pop-up.\n\nWhere Kalshi had unlimited options but a tight overall budget of $50, I felt The Polymarket was more tailored to what people might want from a free-grocery stunt in the winter months. I found the staff was generally friendlier, and the whole thing was a bit less confusing. The emphasis on donation also made it feel less like a shiny corporate branding exercise.\n\nEven Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a fan of affordability but not prediction markets, seemed to begrudgingly applaud Polymarket's move.\n\nWho knows what will happen over the next few days, as The Polymarket opens. Maybe the shelves will run dry. Either way, Polymarket seemed to know what it was doing at the jump.\n\nPlus, the heating lamps were a nice touch.",

    "description": "Words like \"frame mogging\" and \"jestermaxxing\" are suddenly everywhere online. It's not just organic — people make money spreading these trends.",
    "fullText": "Have you jestermaxxed recently? Have you or someone you know been frame-mogged by an ASU fraternity leader? Did it cause your cortisol levels to spike?\n\nIf you've been spending too much time online lately, you're likely seeing strange warpings of the English language.\n\nMe? I think it's great. We need some new words! But also, be mindful that these new silly words aren't necessarily spreading organically. Some people are making money off their spread.\n\nThe sudden virality of these words comes as a 20-year-old looksmaxxing livestreamer who goes by \"Clavicular\" has broken containment of the relatively small corner of the internet for the looksmaxxing community. Suddenly, these words seem to be the latest obsession of the overly online crowd.\n\nAnd with that comes a whole new way of speaking.\n\nFor now, don't worry about who or why Clavicular is. You can read this article about him, or wait until The New York Times publishes its story (a reporter was with him last weekend to write an expected profile). The thing is, for our purposes, the details about him don't really matter — he's a 20-year-old looksmaxxer who also livestreams on Kick. That's all you need to know. It's like the origins of the \"67\" meme: Sure, there's some obscure backstory with a line from a rap song, but the meme is really about how it means nothing. (I reached out to Clavicular, but didn't hear back.)\n\nThe output — these wacky phrases that are wrenching the English language to its logical conclusion of rot — is what is really important here. I suspect that long after we forget about the guy, we'll still be using these new terms like \"mogged\" and \"maxxed.\"\n\n(For the record, \"mogged\" is looksmaxxing forum lingo that's been around for a while and means to be better looking or better than someone else. It's now being used as a suffix, like \"frame-mogged\" for someone who has more impressive shoulders.)\n\nThere's no question that this vernacular has broken containment to normies. Whether that's good or bad is a matter of opinion.\n\nThere's also a business reason that suddenly you're seeing these wacky phrases everywhere, and it's not just organic meme adoption.\n\nA lot of the most over-the-top posts about \"jestermaxxing\" and \"frame mogging\" are coming as captions to video clips from third parties known as \"clippers.\"\n\nClippers are people who post short clips on social media from longer content like podcasts, livestreams, gaming, or even TV shows and movies. These clippers can have a financial motive: They can get paid by creator programs on platforms like TikTok, X, and Instagram Reels if their posts go viral. And they can also be paid by content creators themselves to promote their podcasts, livestreams, or other products.\n\nClippers are incentivized to find the most ridiculous moments in a livestream and slap on the most clickable, enticing caption or commentary for their posts on X and other social media platforms. This has created a kind of house style all its own — note the off-capitalization and tendency to end in a question.\n\nThe internet is always giving us new words and new terms. Sure, \"jestermaxxing\" will eventually sound old and cringe (perhaps soon, even), but this is the beautiful bounty of online communication. New ways of communicating and expressing! In this case, it also seems relevant to keep in mind that the new memewords are being pushed by people who are chasing dollars, not just lols.",

    "fullText": "From Cece and Schmidt finally saying \"I do\" on \"New Girl\" to Chuck and Blair eloping in Central Park during the \"Gossip Girl\" finale, weddings have made for some of the most memorable moments on television.\n\nThe wedding dresses that these beloved characters wear are almost as unforgettable as the weddings themselves — though some for better reasons than others.\n\nFor better or worse, Business Insider looked back at some of the best and worst dresses from TV weddings.\n\nBlair finally marries Chuck Bass in the \"Gossip Girl\" series finale in a last-minute wedding in Central Park.\n\nNever one to miss an opportunity for a fashion moment, Blair wore a pale-blue Elie Saab gown to the nuptials.\n\nThe dress was made of sparkly, semi-sheer fabric, and the bodice was adorned with floral appliqué to create a high-fashion yet timeless look, much like Blair herself. A belt at the waist and a tiara completed the showstopping look.\n\nSerena and Dan Humphrey's on-and-off relationship was a major plot point throughout the six seasons of \"Gossip Girl.\" The Upper East Side socialite and Brooklyn writer finally tied the knot in a flash-forward at the end of the show's series finale.\n\nNever one to follow convention, Serena ditched the classic white bridal dress for a gold Georges Chakra couture ball gown. The strapless ensemble featured an entirely gold bodice, with gold detailing across the tulle skirt that resembled paint splatters.\n\nDid the dress look more like it belonged at the Met Gala than at a wedding? Maybe, but this is \"Gossip Girl\" baby! And for a character as fashionable and trendsetting as Serena, it made perfect sense that she'd go against the norm on her wedding day.\n\n''I will never get tired seeing Blake wearing one of my designs and transforming it into a 'Serena' look,'\" Chakra told Elle in 2012. \"Her character has that effortless chic ability to break the rules and ditch your regular white wedding gown and make metallic gold accents acceptable and cool for a bride.\"\n\nLorelai and Luke finally get married in the \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" finale, saying \"I do\" in the middle of the night just hours before their wedding because they don't want to wait any longer.\n\nThe wedding was romantic, but the navy ensemble Lorelai wore didn't fit the grandeur of the occasion. Her tea-length dress had a faux white blouse on the top, coordinating with a white flower on the waistline. She wore a lacy cardigan over the gown, giving the whole look a matronly feel. The outfit didn't look like something Lorelai would wear to celebrate her marriage, especially given how over-the-top her fashion was on the show.\n\nThe dress also fell flat because it didn't compare to the stunning, blush gown she bought to marry Luke on season six of the original \"Gilmore Girls\" series. Even a look like the sparkly suit Emily Gilmore wore to renew her vows to her husband Richard would have been more fitting than the outfit Lorelai ended up in.\n\nJess and Nick get married in season seven of \"New Girl.\" Jess' tea-length white dress is pretty, with its belted, empire waist and full skirt.\n\nBut it doesn't make much of a statement, and Jess' outfit gets turned into the butt of a joke when she's forced to wear an eye patch after injuring herself.\n\nJess and Nick's wedding was a highly anticipated moment for \"New Girl\" fans, and it was disappointing that Jess didn't get to have her fashion moment as they said their vows.\n\nMolly had plenty of dating drama through the five seasons of \"Insecure,\" but she gets a happy ending — and one last incredible outfit — during the series finale.\n\nThe ambitious lawyer's style inspired a number of listicles while \"Insecure\" was on air, and star Yvonne Orji once joked that fans loved Molly's wardrobe more than the actual character.\n\nMolly sported a stunning Oscar de la Renta gown to tie the knot with her coworker, Taurean. The strapless dress, decorated throughout with a pattern of ferns, featured a sweetheart neckline and a voluminous skirt. It was chic, distinct, and perfect for Molly's character.\n\nMonica and Chandler's wedding on \"Friends\" takes place in both the season seven finale and season eight premiere for a two-episode special.\n\nMonica planned the wedding meticulously, and though she couldn't wear the dress she originally wanted after another shopper blackmailed her for it in \"The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress,\" she still chose a gorgeous gown for the big day.\n\nHer fit-and-flare gown was fitted throughout the bodice, forming a V-neckline. The dress had no embroidery or embellishment aside from a subtle trim on the neckline for a simple yet beautiful look.\n\nPhoebe's avant-garde style was a hallmark of her character throughout \"Friends,\" and her wedding dress needed to fit that aesthetic when she married Mike in season 10 of the series.\n\nHer silk gown's exposed corset, jewel sleeves, and ruched skirt had an old-world feel, while her traditional veil made her look like a bride.\n\nShe also wore an embroidered floral jacket until it was time for her outdoor winter wedding, which felt even more fitting for her character.\n\nWhen Rachel is introduced on \"Friends,\" she appears at Central Perk in her wedding dress, looking for Monica after running out on her wedding.\n\nThe gown is quintessential '90s wedding fashion, with its heavy lace, full skirt, and off-the-shoulder sleeves. But the whole look feels gaudy, from the floral print on the skirt to the voluminous veil.\n\nConsidering the look went along with Rachel's spoiled persona, it was fitting for the occasion.\n\nHilary donned a wedding dress in the season four premiere of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" when her boyfriend Trevor proposed to her while bungee jumping for their news show.\n\nThe dress had an off-the-shoulder neckline, subtle lace on the bodice, and a tulle skirt full of volume. The gown fit the '90s aesthetic without being over-the-top. Even Hilary's voluminous veil looked great with her ensemble.\n\nUnfortunately, Trevor died during his proposal, so the dress never actually appeared at a wedding.\n\nIn season four, the country-music superstar finally marries the love of her life, Deacon Claybourne. And her beautiful off-the-shoulder dress is easily one of our favorites on this list.\n\n\"Nashville\" costume designer Susie DeSanto told Glamour in 2016 that she wanted the dress to reflect Rayna's character and be \"simple, honest, not too fussy, elegant, and sophisticated.\" DeSanto said she showed sketches to Connie Britton, who played Rayna in the show, and ultimately wanted to create the kind of wedding dress \"you wear when you marry your true love.\"\n\nThe dress featured a lace bodice and a satin skirt, with a hand-sewn flower appliqué, according to Glamour.\n\nApril's season 10 wedding became famous among \"Grey's Anatomy\" fans, as she ran away with Jackson and married him instead of her fiancé, Matthew.\n\nBut her dress was almost as memorable as the episode itself. The dress had sheer, short sleeves that flowed into an adorned bodice, creating the illusion that the appliqué was floating up her torso. The dropped-waist skirt was adorned with flowers, and the gown flowed into a train.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Jackson interrupted the wedding to whisk April away.\n\nPreston left Cristina at the altar in the season three finale of \"Grey's Anatomy,\" though the bride-to-be had also been apprehensive about the wedding.\n\nDespite not wanting to be a bride, she looked every bit the part in her mermaid gown. Christina's lace dress was adorned with understated silver embellishments, and her updo showcased the choker Preston's mother gave her for the wedding.\n\nThe dress was gorgeous; it was just odd to see Cristina Yang wearing it.\n\nFrom preppy shirts and Juicy Couture tracksuits to halter tops and lace camis, Summer's closet perfectly encapsulated the colorful and chaotic boldness of early 2000s fashion. She loved bright shades, bold patterns, and graphic T-shirts — all of which matched her spunky, outspoken personality.\n\nMaybe the costume department was trying to illustrate Summer's character arc from trendy teen to vegan queen by picking this simple wedding dress. We love a classic moment, but the bodice was ill-fitting and completely swallowed Rachel Bilson's figure, while the full skirt looked wrinkled.\n\nPlus, it was just a little boring. After four seasons of watching Summer and Seth's love story, we would've loved Summer's dress to feel a little more memorable.\n\nIf \"Gossip Girl\" was a fantasy of NYC fashion, \"Girls\" set out to be the reality with off-the-rack clothes meant to reflect what women really wear in the city.\n\nAt first glance, the short, casual dress seems to fit Jessa's eccentric style. \"Girls\" costume designer Jenn Rogien told Fashionista in 2014 that Lena Dunham wanted the cast to \"look the best they had all season\" at the wedding. Rogien said she looked at both vintage and runway pieces and ultimately decided on this dress at a boutique owned by the mother of Jemima Kirke, who plays Jessa.\n\nThe story behind the outfit is great, but the dress doesn't fit the season finale's major twist. We love the cutout detailing on the oversize sleeves, but they clash with the lacy skirt. The overall look feels too casual, more akin to something you would've found at Free People in 2012. There are so many beautiful vintage and boho bridal looks, but this feels forgettable — and that's the opposite of Jessa.\n\nFrom an organ remix of \"Milkshake\" to a guest appearance by Victoria Beckham playing herself, a lot was happening during Wilhelmina Slater's wedding in the second season of \"Ugly Betty.\" But that didn't stop the former supermodel and MODE magazine editor from stealing the show.\n\nWilhelmina walked down the aisle in a luxurious silk gown designed by Vera Wang, who also played herself during the episode. The strapless column dress featured only a touch of sparkling embellishment, letting the gown's cut and stunning fabric take center stage.\n\nWe also loved how Wilhelmina paired the dress with matching silk elbow-length opera gloves. The ensemble couldn't have been a better match for our favorite stylish supervillain.\n\nSeveral major story decisions confused fans during the ninth and final season of \"How I Met Your Mother.\" But we're here to talk about Robin and Barney's wedding, not that wild twist in the series finale.\n\nRobin opts for a Monique Lhuillier gown to wed the reformed womanizer, and there's a lot we love about it. The exposed corset is a modern and unexpected style choice, and it pairs well with the sheer sleeves that hang just off her shoulders.\n\nHowever, it all gets ruined with the big, sparkling, silver belt. Not only does the belt's design seem dated, especially when the rest of the gown feels so fresh, but it cuts off Robin's body and throws off the ensemble's proportions, messing up what could have been a very chic moment.\n\nLily and Marshall got married in the season two finale of \"How I Met Your Mother\" after briefly breaking up at the start of it.\n\nLily's dress somehow had both too much and too little going on, as the bodice was heavily adorned with crystals and a silver bow, while the ball-gown skirt was plain.\n\nThe dress looked disconnected, and it didn't do Lily justice. Marshall's hat wasn't a great look, either.\n\nSimon agrees to marry Daphne only to protect her honor in the first season of \"Bridgerton,\" and their small, intimate wedding reflects that it's not much of a celebration.\n\nDaphne's wedding dress might not be grand or dramatic, but it's still beautiful for the moment. The gown features an empire waist and cap sleeves befitting of the time, and white flowers bloom across the skirt — a wink at the white rose Simon picked for Daphne earlier in the season, according to The Knot.\n\nClaire and Jamie get married in season one of \"Outlander\" to protect her from being taken by Jonathan Randall. However, they end up developing deep romantic feelings for each other after saying their marriage vows.\n\nClaire's green and off-white gown for the nuptials was elegant and sexy, with its low-cut, scooped neckline and off-the-shoulder, quarter-length sleeves. The corset cinched tight, and the skirt was full.\n\nDelicate beading adorned the bodice and the center of the skirt, making it stand out. Though Claire clearly felt torn about marrying Jamie because she was already married to Frank in the future, her wedding dress was breathtaking.\n\nBelly Conklin spends much of season three of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" planning her wedding to Jeremiah Fisher.\n\nIn episode four, she goes wedding dress shopping and selects a white slip gown designed by Victoria Beckham. The gown has a scooped neckline and a low back with flared detailing on the skirt.\n\nThe gown is beautiful, but in the context of the series, it feels like an underwhelming choice for Belly. Because her parents aren't paying for the wedding, she tries to find the most affordable dress that she likes, which leads her to the simple dress.\n\nOn another bride, the gown may have been a dream dress, but on Belly, it feels like a symbol of the tension around her nuptials.\n\nThe protagonist of \"My Lady Jane\" is forced into an arranged marriage with Guildford Dudley in episode two of the series, which was later canceled.\n\nJane does everything she can to avoid the wedding, but she ultimately does marry Guildford in a stunning ball gown. The cream dress featured an embroidered, strapless Basque bodice that flowed into a floor-length skirt with additional beading. Detached, sheer sleeves fastened at her neck with a ruffled neckline and gem detailing.\n\nJane's gown was gorgeous, even if she wasn't excited to tie the knot.",

    "description": "One Air Force base's new mandated greetings for security personnel saw backlash, with troops and civilian workers calling them 'stupid.'",
    "fullText": "Gate guards at an Air Force base in Oklahoma have become targets of ridicule over a newly mandated greeting, according to an internal email.\n\nThe message, recently sent out by local senior enlisted leader MSgt. Bradley Opfar, warned against mocking the guards, known as Defenders, for delivering a scripted line: \"Good morning, sir/ma'am. Welcome to Altus AFB. Victory begins here!\"\n\n\"It frustrates me to write this to you all, but it is necessary,\" the email said. \"Anyone found disrespecting Defenders will be held accountable.\" The message warned that troops could face charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, while civilian employees could be reported to their supervisors.\n\nThe message included a sampling of the reactions that guards have faced at gates since February 4:\n\nOthers have dismissed the greeting as \"stupid\" and \"dumb,\" according to the message, which the Air Force verified.\n\nA spokesperson for Altus Air Force Base told Business Insider that \"victory begins here\" is its \"base vision.\"\n\n\"We adhere to a culture of professionalism and respect for every person who comes on our base, which is emphasized by the new Air Force-wide policy,\" the spokesperson said, adding that \"disrespect toward any member of our community will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe base, located in Altus, Oklahoma, is home to courses that train pilots on one of the military's largest cargo aircraft, the C-17 Globemaster III, and another unit that trains personnel on notoriously complex refueling missions. Altus AFB supports roughly 2,000 permanent military personnel and employs a significant number of civilian workers.\n\nThe base started requiring the new greeting after Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach and the top enlisted airman, Master Sergeant David Wolfe, sent a memo on January 30 addressing base greetings.\n\n\"The way we greet one another matters,\" the memo said. \"Professional greetings — at installation entry control points and throughout interactions with the public — must be the standard. First impressions set the tone and when paired with professional image, reinforce trust, authority and pride.\"\n\nThat memo referenced another base where gate guards greet drivers by saying, \"Fight's on!\"\n\n\"At one of our premier bases, Defenders greet patrons with, 'Good Morning, Sir/Ma'am/General/Chief. Welcome to ____ AFB. Fight's On!\" the memo read.\n\n\"This simple phrase,\" it continued, \"signals entry onto a military installation protected by vigilant Defenders and reflects our identity within the profession of arms. Every installation should ensure professional greetings are constantly practiced.\"\n\nThe new mandates are the latest sign of what appears to be a broader cultural shift inside the Air Force. The service last year introduced new quarterly uniform and fitness inspections — later scaling them back to once a year — and tightened grooming standards.",

    "fullText": "Vybe, the startup cofounded by two repeat Y Combinator entrepreneurs, has raised $10 million to bring vibe coding inside large companies.\n\nThe practice of vibe coding has become more widespread as it allows people to use AI and natural language prompts to build an app, rather than traditional programming. The sector has attracted hundreds of millions in venture funding and is blurring the lines for businesses deciding between buying software or just vibe-coding their own tools.\n\nWhile popular vibe-coding products like Lovable and Replit have made it easy for companies to create prototypes and landing pages, Vybe offers stronger security that cannot be modified by AI and also taps into internal data systems, said cofounder and CEO Quang Hoang.\n\nHoang previously founded the engineering mentorship platform Plato and is building Vybe alongside cofounder and CTO Fabien Devos, founder of the security AI startup Wolfia.\n\nVybe lets teams across an organization collaborate on apps. Engineering teams manage access to internal systems like Salesforce, Snowflake, and Databricks, while business teams can build apps for onboarding, performance reviews, customer service, and more.\n\n\"The new SaaS is going to be more like Legos,\" Hoang said, referring to software-as-a-service. \"You can build it exactly how you want.\"\n\nVybe also offers app templates created by high-profile executives, such as former Airbnb product leader Lenny Rachitsky and Front cofounder Mathilde Collin, that users can \"remix\" to suit their needs, including templates for performance reviews and one-on-one meetings.\n\nFirst Round Capital led Vybe's seed round, which featured participation from Y Combinator, the CEOs of Datadog and Grammarly, and product leaders from OpenAI and Meta.\n\nVybe has six employees and dozens of customers, Hoang said. It plans to use the funding to hire engineers. Vybe charges $12 per user a month, plus usage-based credits for app development.\n\nThe round comes as vibe coding continues to attract major funding — with startups like Emergent pulling in tens of millions from Khosla Ventures and SoftBank — even as Barclays analysts warn the initial boom may be cooling.\n\nAt the same time, investors are also weighing how AI and vibe-coding tools can reshape the software sector. Software stocks have entered one of their sharpest downturns in years, shedding roughly $2 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Vybe used to raise its $10 million seed round. One slide has been removed, and another redacted so that the deck can be shared publicly.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design is here. Apple and Google actually worked together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which makes switching between the two platforms more seamless.\n\nNews first broke about this partnership back in December, and, at that time, Google released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. Shortly after, Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.3, which featured the transfer tool. Now, iOS 26.3 is here, and with it, an easier way to switch from iPhone to a device made by Google, Samsung, or any other Android OEM.\n\nThe feature seems easy enough to use. Once you update your iPhone to iOS 26.3, you can head to Settings > General, then scroll down to \"Transfer or Reset iPhone.\" Tap this option, then choose \"Transfer to Android.\" Here, iOS will present a pop-up, telling you to place your iPhone next to your new Android device, where you can transfer photos, messages, and apps, among other data points. (That said, health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" cannot be transferred.)\n\nYou'll need to make sure both devices are running the latest updates, are connected to wifi, and have Bluetooth enabled. However, Apple also says your Android device should be in the \"setup process,\" which means you likely won't be able to use this feature if your Android phone is already set up. From here, your iPhone will ask you to scan a QR code that should appear on your Android device. Alternatively, you'll be able to tap \"Other Options\" on your iPhone to enter the Session ID and Pairing Code that should appear on your Android.\n\nNow, you can choose the data you want to transfer, including photos, contacts, calendars, call history, and messages. Tap \"Continue\" once complete, then choose to transfer your eSIM, if applicable. (You'll need to double-click the side of your iPhone when prompted to complete the eSIM transfer.) This works in the other direction too, though Apple says you do still need to use the Move to iOS app on Android—at least until Google sets up a similar protocol on its end.\n\nApple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",

    "title": "When You Need to Do 'Activation Exercises' (and When You Don't)",
    "description": "Activations don't always have an advantage over other types of warmups.",
    "fullText": "“Activation” exercises are often recommended at the beginnings of workouts. You might get the idea—whether from random TikToks or from a trainer you pay for their expertise—that activations are necessary to get your muscles firing correctly and able to take advantage of the workout to come. That’s not exactly true, though, so let’s dive in to what activations really do.\n\nThe explanation you’ll hear most often is that our muscles—often specifically our glutes, or butt muscles—“forget” how to fire correctly. But that isn’t really a thing that happens, as physical therapist Tyler Detmer told Lifehacker when discussing so-called gluteal amnesia. Our muscles don’t need specific exercises to be able to contract correctly.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean activation exercises are useless; it's better to think of these moves as warmups with a specific purpose. As I’ve written before, warmup exercises occupy a spectrum from general (like jogging on a treadmill before squats) to specific (doing lighter squats before doing heavier squats).\n\nThe warmups that are sometimes called “activation” exercises fall in the middle of that continuum. They can help you to get ready for your heavier exercises of the day, since they’re fairly specific to the muscles involved. If the person who designed your workout is good at their job, they're a great way to prepare for your working exercises. Unfortunately, not all activations are a good use of your time. So here are some of the cases where activation exercises are useful—and some where they aren’t.\n\nIf you’re going to do isolation exercises, it helps to know what it feels like to work the muscle properly. Using glutes as our example again, a side-lying leg raise can be done in ways that really use the glutes (when your leg is slightly behind you) or in ways that distribute some of the load to other muscles (like when your leg is slightly in front of you). When you’re doing those leg raises, you can pay attention to whether you’re feeling your glutes—but to do that, you have to know what it feels like to work your glutes.\n\nThat’s where activation exercises come in. You do a movement that’s hard to do without using your glutes, and you get to feel the sensations that go along with using that muscle. You might feel a burning sensation as the muscle begins to fatigue, or a tight, full feeling as the muscle fills with fluid (this is what bodybuilders call a “pump”). All of this helps to direct your attention to that muscle and what it feels like. When you do your next exercise, you’ll remember that feeling.\n\nThe more work you give a muscle, the bigger and stronger it tends to get. We often call that amount of work “volume” and measure that as the number of sets: You’ll build more muscle if you do six sets of squats at each workout than if you only do three.\n\nActivation exercises, if they’re challenging enough, can count toward those sets. Imagine we have two people in the gym: One does three sets each of banded walks and single-leg glute bridges (both often classed as activation exercises) before doing three sets of barbell hip thrusts. The other just does the hip thrusts. That first person is giving their glutes more work than the second, regardless of how the exercises are labeled.\n\nTo use activation exercises this way, though, they have to be challenging. If you do your activations heavy enough that you’re at or near the point of failure by the end of each set, they’re adding to your total volume. But if they’re light and easy and you’re just going through the motions, they aren’t really adding anything.\n\nI’ve described a few ways that activation exercises can help in your workouts, but that doesn’t mean that they’re unskippable. You don’t need to feel a muscle working to know that you’re giving it a good workout. And if you’d like to get more volume for a body part, you can do those extra sets before, after, or during your main workout; they don’t have to happen during the “activation” stage at the beginning.\n\nSo if you haven’t been doing activations, that’s fine. Just make sure you’re warming up in some kind of appropriate way. (If you’re not sure, read through this guide I wrote to putting together an effective warmup. A warmup is about what gets you ready to work, and it should really be personalized to your body and your workout.)\n\nBut if your trainer has given you activation exercises, or if you’ve seen a few you’d like to try online, go ahead and do them. They’ll give you extra work for the target muscle, and you might find that they help you to feel ready by the time you begin the main sets of your workout.",

    "fullText": "YouTube has finally come to Apple Vision Pro. YouTube for Vision OS is a free, standalone app that lets users log into their existing YouTube accounts through their Vision headsets and stream videos like they would expect to, including standard videos, 180° videos, 360° videos, and YouTube Shorts. Vision Pro M5 users can stream 8K videos, and premium YouTube members can download videos directly to their headsets, a must for long flights.\n\nGoogle, YouTube's parent company, has apparently been working on the app for a while. In 2024, a spokesperson confirmed that a standalone Vision Pro app was \"on our roadmap,\" but until today, the only way Vision users could watch YouTube on their headsets was through the Safari web browser.\n\nThe new YouTube app is designed to fit into Vision's spatial computing environments. \"Rather than just responding to different screen sizes, we needed something that responds to different spaces, volumes and use cases,\" YouTube's senior UX designer Brendan Polley told Apple. \"We built an entirely new design system that isolated core elements—comments, the play button, 'like' and 'dislike'—to fit any layout.\"\n\nHaving downloaded the app, it works exactly as intended. If you're looking for something that demonstrates Vision Pro's immersive video capabilities, you should check out the just-released 360° videos from the Milano Cortina winter Olympics on NBC's channel. Immersive luge is terrifying!",

    "description": "Mortgage rates inched lower this week as an upbeat jobs report bumped the bond market slightly higher.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates dipped slightly lower this week, weathering volatility in bond markets. While bond yields sagged early in the week, Wednesday's surprising jobs report sent yields soaring. The news was digested quickly by the Treasury market, and a recovery to previously low levels took just a day.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed rate this week was 6.09%, down from 6.11% the previous week. The 52-week low is 6.06%. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed averaged 5.44%, down from 5.50%.\n\n“Bolstered by strong economic growth, a solid labor market, and mortgage rates at three-year lows, housing affordability continues to measurably improve,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. \"These factors have caught the attention of many prospective homebuyers, driving purchase application activity higher than a year ago.”\n\nDiscover the best mortgage refinance lenders.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and the U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate, not just with banks, but also with credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is an amazing mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on your financial goals when refinancing, how long you plan to stay in the same house, and on your break-even point after paying the refinance closing costs.\n\nMortgage rates often decrease before a Federal Reserve meeting rather than after. So, what should you expect rates to do before the Fed meeting on January 27-28?\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already buy mortgage bonds, and Trump wants them to purchase $200 billion in bonds. Would this strategy cause mortgage rates to decrease?\n\nAverage mortgage rates are in the low 6% range, but there are ways to snag a lower rate. Learn about eight strategies for securing a mortgage rate under 6%.\n\nChase Home Lending has launched a mortgage refinance rate sale, and borrowers have until Sunday to lock in a discounted rate. Here's how to qualify and apply.\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs and home equity loans work differently. So, how much interest can you expect to pay on a second mortgage? Learn how these rates work.",

    "description": "You'll also get $30 in accessory credit while pre-ordering just for registering your interest.",
    "fullText": "Samsung has officially revealed when its next Galaxy Unpacked event, which is where everyone's expecting the Galaxy S26 series to be announced, will take place. But before it airs on Feb. 25 at 1 p.m. EST, the company's offering the chance to get ahead of the game by trading in your current phone for a little extra moolah. Right now, you can sign up on Samsung's website to trade in your phone for up to $900 while pre-ordering a Galaxy S26 phone (or, on the very unlikely chance the S26 isn't announced at the event, whatever is announced in its place).\n\nThat's $200 more than Samsung currently offers on trade-ins for its other phones, which top out at $700 when trading in a Galaxy S24 Ultra for a Galaxy S25 phone. And while you're signing up, you'll also get $30 to spend on accessories during (but not before or after) your pre-order. You can also choose to be entered in a $5,000 sweepstakes for general Samsung online store credit, if you'd like.\n\nThe catch? The pre-order window doesn't seem to be open quiet yet. Usually, that happens within a week of Galaxy Unpacked airing, but you can still get the process started now. Just head to Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked reservation website, enter your name and at least an email address (you can also toss in your phone number, if you'd like), and you'll be taken to the form you need. If you want to enter the sweepstakes, also check the box saying you want to enter.\n\nFrom there, you can pick your current phone manufacturer and your phone model from a drop-down menu. Note that the manufacturer options include Samsung, Apple, Google, and \"Other,\" so it seems like Samsung is willing to let you trade in phones it doesn't make, too. As for the model picker, you can pick models going back around five years for each of the manufacturer options, although if you don't see your model on the list, you can also pick \"Other\" here, too.\n\nI can't promise how much Samsung will give you for each specific phone model, although it stands to reason that newer and higher spec phones will earn you more. I'm also willing to wager that Samsung might give you more credit if you trade in one of its own phones, but that's just speculation. To get the full $900, I'm guessing you'll need to trade in a Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nOnce you've made your selection, hit Submit, then scroll down a bit and click what you're interested in getting offers from Samsung on. Make sure you at least select \"Trade In,\" and then click Submit here, too.\n\nAnd that's it for now. Samsung will now know what type of phone you have and that you're interested in a trade-in, and should email you with an appropriate trade-in offer once it's available. Again, this should happen closer to Unpacked, likely within a week of Feb 25.\n\nAll in all, it's a good opportunity for a deal, but it does continue an unfortunate trend of Samsung's—asking you to pre-order a device before it's officially been revealed, and before you know its full specs list. Luckily, a number of rumors for the Galaxy S26 has made it easy to guess at what we're likely to see, including a similar look to the S25, no ultra thin S26 Edge model, a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and a new 10MP telephoto lens on the Ultra model. For confirmation, though, we have no choice but to wait.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from transferring 20 inmates with commuted death sentences to the nation’s highest security federal prison, warning that officials cannot employ a “sham” process for deciding where to incarcerate the prisoners for the rest of their lives.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly ruled late Wednesday that the government cannot send the former death row inmates to the “Supermax” federal prison in Florence, Colorado, because it likely would violate their Fifth Amendment rights to due process.\n\nKelly cited evidence that officials from the Republican administration “made it clear” to the federal Bureau of Prisons that the inmates had to be sent to ADX Florence — “administrative maximum\" — to punish them because Democratic President Joe Biden had commuted their death sentences.\n\n“At least for now, they will remain serving life sentences for their heinous crimes where they are currently imprisoned,” wrote Kelly, who was nominated to the bench by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn December 2024, less than a month before Trump returned to the White House, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment.\n\nOn his first day back in office, Trump issued an executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to house the 37 inmates “in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.”\n\nTwenty of the 37 inmates are plaintiffs in the lawsuit before Kelly, who issued a preliminary injunction blocking their transfers to Florence while the lawsuit proceeds. All were incarcerated in Terre Haute, Indiana, when Biden commuted their death sentences.\n\nGovernment lawyers argued that the bureau has broad authority to decide what facilities the inmates should be redesignated for after their commutations.\n\n“BOP’s designation decisions are within its exclusive purview and are intended to preserve the safety of inmates, employees, and surrounding communities,” they wrote.\n\nThe judge concluded that the inmates have not had a meaningful opportunity to challenge their redesignations because it appears the outcome of the review process was predetermined.\n\n\"But the Constitution requires that whenever the government seeks to deprive a person of a liberty or property interest that the Due Process Clause protects — whether that person is a notorious prisoner or a law-abiding citizen — the process it provides cannot be a sham,\" Kelly wrote.\n\nThe Florence prison has housed some of the most notorious criminals in federal custody, including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The prison is “unmatched in its draconian conditions,” the inmates' attorneys argued.\n\n“The categorical redesignations challenged here deprived Plaintiffs of an opportunity to show why they should not be condemned to a life bereft of human contact, in a cell the size of a parking spot, where they will see nothing out the window but a strip of sky,” they wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys said other courts have held that the conditions are not objectively cruel and unusual.\n\n“Plaintiffs fail to show that conditions at ADX are atypical for them,” they wrote.",

    "fullText": "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) dared Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) to try to throw him in jail during an explosive exchange at a Thursday Senate hearing.\n\nEllison was one of multiple witnesses to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday, and Hawley focused his question on fraud within the state of Missouri. The line of questioning led to Hawley flat-out accusing Ellison of being a criminal and both men demanding the other resign.\n\nHawley and Ellison threw down over a group convicted of fraud in the state during the Covid-19 pandemic. The group, Feeding Our Futures, was found to have defrauded a federal child nutrition program for around $250 million.\n\nHawley brought up reports that Ellison’s campaign received $10,000 from the group and suggested it was quid pro quo and he should be indicted. Ellison denied taking money directly from the group to help in any investigation.\n\n“It’s my hearing, pal!” Hawley warned Ellison as he continued to deny the accusations from the senator.\n\n“I’m not your pal. Don’t call me pal!” Ellison shot back.\n\n“Well, I should call you ‘prisoner’ because you should be in jail,” Hawley said as he accused Ellison of ignoring accusations of fraud against Feeding Our Futures.\n\n“Well, see what you can do about it,” Ellison defiantly said.\n\n“In 2019, whistleblowers came to you in your office and referred to you fraud allegations from feeding our futures and you blow them off,” Hawley said, referring to a report from the Minnesota Star Tribune suggesting whistleblowers brought up the fraud years prior to the group getting caught.\n\n“That’s a lie,” Ellison said, adding later, “They did not come to my office. You’re completely wrong about that. I did not take anybody’s money.”\n\nThe two continued debating whether reports of the $10,000 campaign contribution were true until things wrapped up with the pair each demanding the other’s resignation.\n\n“You’ve been right at the center of this fraud thing from the beginning, and you’ve enabled it,” Hawley said. “And sir, you should resign.”\n\n“Sir, you should resign,” Ellison responded. “I was thinking the same thing about you. I was thinking the exact same thing about you.”\n\nThe post Minnesota AG Dares GOP Senator To Try To Throw Him in Jail During Explosive Hearing: ‘I Should Call You Prisoner’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill says \"there are no easy games\" in the Nations League after being drawn with Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia.\n\nThe campaign begins with a quadruple-header from 23 September until 6 October, and two final matches in November.\n\nBefore starting their Nations League campaign, Northern Ireland travel to Italy in March for a World Cup play-off semi-final as they look to reach the tournament for the first time since 1986.\n\nO'Neill's side secured that play-off, and promotion to League B, by winning their League C group in 2024 and the manager says it's an \"exciting draw.\n\n\"The Nations League has proven to be a very competitive and valuable competition for us,\" he said.\n\n\"We will aim to approach every game with ambition, to be difficult to play against, and to give our supporters performances they can be proud of.\"\n\nEngland to face Spain and Croatia in Nations League\n\nNorthern Ireland famously beat Ukraine at the Euro 2016 finals but lost a friendly between the sides in 2021.\n\nIn a disappointing year, Hungary were relegated from League A and also missed out on a World Cup play-off following a dramatic defeat by the Republic of Ireland in November.\n\nGeorgia, whose star player is PSG's Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, beat Armenia in a play-off to remain in League B.\n\n\"It's a competitive group - there's no doubt about that,\" O'Neill added.\n\n\"At this level there are no easy games and we fully respect the challenge that lies ahead.\n\n\"We have faced Ukraine in recent years but haven't beaten them since 2016, so there's familiarity there\n\n\"Georgia are perhaps the unknown quantity for many, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous.\n\n\"Hungary are a well-organised, physical side with quality throughout the team and strong home support, which always makes for a tough test.\"\n\nFormer Northern Ireland defender and BBC Sport NI pundit Stephen Craigan said the \"draw could have been a lot worse\" and it would be realistic for O'Neill's side to avoid relegation.\n\n\"We've got more than enough in our locker to be competitive,\" he added.\n\n\"If we could stay in League B after this campaign I think everyone would be pleased and see it as progress.\n\n\"I think stability, which would be staying in League B. You can carry that experience forward.\n\n\"Getting relegated would not be the end of the world, but when you work so hard to get that promotion you want to try and maintain it as much as you can.\"\n\nCraigan admitted it was a positive Northern Ireland had earned promotion to League B and playing at the highest level possible would help a young squad.\n\nHe also pointed to last year's World Cup qualifiers, and said the side's away form was an area they could improve despite some strong performances.\n\n\"You are going to be playing against better teams and going to tougher venues,\" added Craigan.\n\n\"It will put the younger players under a bit of stress, but that's how they learn and progress.\n\n\"The next stage is to maintain a strong level of performance but get results off the back of them, particularly away from home.\n\n\"Our record away from home hasn't always been great, so that's the next challenge for this young group, to be more competitive.\"",

They put a pole in my thigh with four bolts, so screws and bolts to knit it back together.\n\n\"My first surgeon said he didn't want me to put any weight on my leg for three months, which is around about now, and you can see that I am walking.\n\n\"We got a second specialist who said I needed to start putting weight on it, increasing from 10% up to 100% within three weeks.\n\n\"But I kept my crutches for a further two weeks. Overall, they say it will be between six to 12 months before my leg starts healing properly.\"\n\nLatest Charlton Athletic news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Charlton Athletic content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Former Chelsea and Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling has joined Dutch club Feyenoord on a deal until the end of the season.\n\nThe England international left Chelsea by mutual consent in January after agreeing a settlement package with the Stamford Bridge club over the final 18 months of his contract, worth in excess of £300,000-per-week.\n\nSterling, 31, has spent time discussing numerous options, but joined Feyenoord, who are second in the Eredivisie table and managed by former Manchester United and Arsenal striker Robin van Persie.\n\n\"As a free agent, I've had, for the first time in a long time, the opportunity to control the next step,\" he said.\n\n\"In my career. I wanted to take my time to speak with clubs and their head coaches to better understand the role they envisioned for me and ensure that I can add real value in this next chapter.\n\n\"Having spoken in great detail with Robin, I'm confident that Feyenoord is a place I can be happy and establish myself as a valued member of the team. Playing abroad is a whole new challenge for me - and one I'm ready to embrace. Honestly, I'm just excited to get started.\"\n\nFeyenoord are 17 points behind league leaders PSV and Van Persie added: \"Naturally it's a fantastic feat that we've managed to convince a player of Raheem's calibre to sign with us.\n\n\"His football resume speaks for itself: he's a player whose qualities can change the outcome of a game without a doubt, and I am convinced he will turn out to be a valuable addition to the team as we work towards achieving our goals in the second half of this season.\"\n\nSources told BBC Sport that around 18 clubs in England and across Europe expressed an interest in Sterling.\n\nThe opportunity to play in a competitive league, to help Feyenoord achieve Champions League qualification and Van Persie's vision for his role in the team persuaded the forward to move to Holland.\n\nAfter joining Chelsea from Manchester City in July 2022, Sterling was supposed to be the face of a new era at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIn his first two seasons, the England international featured in 59 out of a possible 76 Premier League games under four different managers during a turbulent few years under the BlueCo ownership.\n\nBut after Chelsea appointed Enzo Maresca as manager in June 2024, the forward was loaned to Premier League rivals Arsenal after being deemed surplus to requirements by the Italian.\n\nHowever, after failing to impress during an underwhelming loan spell with the Gunners, Sterling was one of several players banished to the Chelsea 'bomb squad' by Maresca and made available for transfer last summer.\n\nHis move to Feyenoord draws the line under a difficult final two years with the London club.\n\nThis is big for the Eredivisie - but also for people in Holland, where the English game is really popular.\n\nSterling has been part of the Premier League for so long and achieved big things, especially with Manchester City.\n\nWhen players who have won the Premier League in England, like Jordan Henderson and Sterling, come to Holland it is a bit like \"wow, is this really happening?\"\n\nWithout them even kicking a ball or playing it already gives an extra layer of allure, or something special, to the Eredivisie.\n\nLet's see how it goes in a football sense, but I think Sterling still has a decent level and especially for the Eredivisie - so it could work out for player and club.\n\nHe might get the fun back of playing football, and Feyenoord boss Robin van Persie knows England well.\n\nSterling can just enjoy himself, and a lot of people will really like the fact he is playing. That could be a bonus for what he is able to show on the pitch.\n\nHe could have a similar impact to Henderson last year at Ajax, putting in good performances on the pitch and then showing his leadership in the dressing room.\n\nSterling is used to the highest standards at clubs like Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nIf he can help bring the level of professionalism and way of working from those clubs, that can only be a positive thing for Feyenoord.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "Ange Postecoglou has criticised Tottenham's transfer strategy while claiming his former side are \"not a big club\" in the wake of Thomas Frank's sacking.\n\nFrank, who replaced Postecoglou as head coach last summer, was sacked on Wednesday with Spurs five points above the Premier League relegation zone.\n\nSpeaking on The Overlap's Stick to Football, external podcast, the Australian praised the club's \"unbelievable\" facilities but said financial limitations meant they could not sign his main targets, such as Pedro Neto, Bryan Mbeumo, Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi, in 2024.\n\n\"When you look at their expenditure and particularly their wages structure, they're not a big club,\" he said.\n\n\"I saw that because, when we were trying to sign players, we weren't in the market for those players.\"\n\nPortuguese forward Neto joined Chelsea in a £54m deal in 2024, Mbeumo moved to Manchester United for £65m last summer, while Semenyo and Guehi moved to Manchester City for a combined £85m last month.\n\nSpurs' Odobert to undergo surgery after rupturing ACL\n\nPostecoglou guided Spurs to fifth in the Premier League during his first season in charge, but he was sacked after a 17th-placed finish the following season.\n\nHe did, however, end the club's 17-year wait for silverware by winning the Europa League in 2025.\n\n\"I think they didn't realise that, to actually win, you've got to take some risks,\" he said.\n\n\"I felt like Tottenham as a club were saying, 'we're one of the big boys', and the reality is I don't think they are.\"\n\nSince Mauricio Pochettino's departure in 2019, Spurs have had five different managers.\n\nJose Mourinho took charge between 2019 and 2021, but was sacked just days before the Carabao Cup final against Manchester City.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo's tenure lasted only four months, while Antonio Conte criticised the club's board and called his players 'selfish' before he was sacked after 16 months in charge.\n\nHis successor Postecoglou was dismissed last summer, while Frank lasted less than a year of his three-year contract.\n\nPostecoglou, who was sacked by Nottingham Forest after just 39 days in charge earlier this season, questioned whether Frank was aware how things would operate when he accepted the job.\n\n\"You know that he can't be the only issue at the club,\" said the 59-year-old.\n\n\"It's a curious club, Tottenham.\n\n\"It made a major pivot at the end of last year, not just with me but with [executive chairman] Daniel [Levy] leaving as well, and created this environment of uncertainty.\n\n\"There's no guarantee whichever manager you bring in. They've had world-class managers there and they haven't had success. And for what reason?\n\n\"Thomas is walking in and what's his objective? What's the club's objective?\n\n\"If you're going to do such a major pivot, you've got to understand there's going to be some instability there.\n\n\"Did Thomas know he was walking into that? I don't know.\"\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nFrank sacked by Spurs after eight months in charge\n\nRamsey fires Newcastle to rare away win at Spurs",

He will try everything to be with us in March. Of course we are in contact, that is a normal thing to do, and we wish him all the best.\n\n\"Whatever we can do for him, we will help and support him. It is a little race against time.\"\n\nAsked whether he believed Bellingham would be fit, Tuchel added: \"Personally, I am optimistic, but I am not sure.\"\n\nIf Bellingham, who has 46 England caps, fails to prove his fitness, the news will arrive as an obvious blow to Tuchel.\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund midfielder's position in the squad has been the subject of conjecture in recent months, with Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers often starting in the number 10 role.\n\nNevertheless, Bellingham is still viewed as a key player for England heading into this summer's World Cup, with Tuchel set to name his squad in May.\n\nReal and England wait on Bellingham injury",

    "fullText": "AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am - first round leaderboard\n\n-10 R Hisatsune (Jap); -9 S Burns (US), K Bradley (US); -8 C Gotterup (US), T Finau (US), P Rodgers (US); -7 N Taylor (Can), A Bhatia (US), A Novak (US), T Hoge (US)\n\nSelected others: -6 J Spieth (US), M Fitzpatrick (Eng); -5 T Fleetwood (Eng), S Lowry (Ire); -4 R McIlroy (NI), H Hall (Eng); -3 J Rose (Eng); -1 R MacIntyre (Sco); E S Scheffler (US); +1 M Penge (Eng)\n\nDefending champion Rory McIlroy made a solid start to the first round of the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am as Japan's Ryo Hisatsune set the early pace with a 10-under 62.\n\nHisatsune, 23, was six under at the turn and concluded a stunning performance with four more birdies on the back nine on the PGA Tour's first signature event of the season.\n\nNorthern Ireland's McIlroy is still in contention six shots back after carding a four-under 68 in California.\n\nBut it was a case of what might have been for McIlroy, who opened with consecutive birdies on the 10th and 11th holes and another on the 17th at Spyglass Hill, with the highlight of his front nine coming when he chipped out of a greenside bunker on the 14th for an eagle.\n\nHowever, his progress was checked after the turn with double bogeys at the two par-three holes - the third and the fifth - when his putter ran cold.\n\nWhile the world number two picked up shots on the second, fourth and ninth, he has ground to make up in Friday's second round, although not as much as the man directly above him in the rankings, Scottie Scheffler.\n\nThe American, who has not finished outside a top 10 place since last year's Player's Championship, struggled to a disappointing even par 72.\n\nWith the opening two rounds of the event split across two courses, Scheffler's friend and compatriot Sam Burns fared much better at Pebble Beach golf links, to end the day in second on nine under alongside Keegan Bradley.\n\nChris Gotterup, a two-time winner already this season, began with six successive birdies and is well placed at eight under along with Tony Finau and Patrick Rodgers.\n\nEngland's Matt Fitzpatrick is at six under and Tommy Fleetwood and Ireland's Shane Lowry made solid starts to sit at five under with Englishman Harry Hall one further back.\n\nWith a $20m (£14.7m) purse available, 18 of the top 20 players in the world are competing in the 80-man field, with Pebble Beach hosting Saturday and Sunday's third and fourth rounds.",

    "fullText": "Wales are set to make changes to midfield and their back-row for Sunday's Six Nations game against France in Cardiff.\n\nSteve Tandy names his side on Friday morning and will resist the temptation to make mass changes after the round one hammering by England.\n\nScarlets centre Joe Hawkins is in line to replace Ben Thomas at 12, while physical Leicester forward Olly Cracknell is poised to bolster the back-row.\n\nWales could also switch their props after loose-head Nicky Smith and tight-head Archie Griffin started at Twickenham, with Rhys Carre and Tomas Francis on the bench.\n\nTandy is otherwise ready to give his side a shot at redemption against Les Bleus, with a six-day turnaround to follow for Wales' home fixture against Scotland on 21 February.\n\nRecalled Francis relishing chance to help Wales\n\nWales U20s aim to provide hope in 'dark time'\n\nWales forward Tshiunza could leave Exeter in summer\n\nFit-again Owen Watkin was another option to come into midfield, but Tandy has gone with the Scarlets pair of Hawkins and Eddie James against France's new-look Pau combination of debutant Fabien Brau-Boirie and Emilien Gailleton.\n\nCardiff's Thomas started against Argentina and Japan in the autumn series before Hawkins, who returned to Wales from Exeter last summer, came in to face New Zealand and South Africa.\n\n\"If you are looking for consistency, the natural fit is bringing in Joe Hawkins at 12 with Eddie because they play together at regional level,\" former Wales hooker Scott Baldwin told Scrum V: The Warm Up.\n\n\"The only other two changes for me would be Cracknell for his work-rate and physicality and then - and this isn't a slight on [hooker] Liam Belcher because he is a brilliant player - but Ryan Elias is an exceptional scrummager. He could come in to that bench spot.\"\n\nWales v France, Principality Stadium\n\nSunday, 15 February at 15:10 GMT\n\nCracknell was a late call-up for the November series after the loss of Taulupe Faletau to injury.\n\nThe 31-year-old blind-side or number eight made his Test debut off the bench against Argentina and then won man of the match in the last-kick win versus Japan.\n\nCracknell is in line to join Aaron Wainwright and Alex Mann in the starting back row at the expense of open-side Josh Macleod.\n\n\"The balance probably wasn't right last weekend,\" said former Wales flanker and captain Ellis Jenkins.\n\n\"It's making sure we have enough physicality so that we can match France at the contact area, tackle and collision.\n\n\"I like Alex Mann and Josh Macleod in their own right, but I am not sure against England and France whether it's a bit under-powered.\"\n\nWales could stick with a split of six forwards and two backs on the bench against the physicality of Les Bleus.\n\nTandy's side are huge underdogs against a France side that eased past Ireland on opening weekend.\n\nWales have lost their past 12 games in the Six Nations, a streak that goes back to the win against Italy in Rome in March 2023.",

We knew if we could be there or thereabouts in the last 20 minutes then the pressure would be on them and luckily we were.\n\n\"We've got a lot of self-belief and we'll back ourselves to the hilt.\n\n\"Belief goes a long way in sport and we spoke about that before the game. I know a lot of headlines all week were we were lambs to the slaughter but we were quietly confident if we brought our best version we could challenge them.\n\n\"It's one game so we wont get too high, we'll enjoy tonight and then we'll get focused on Leeds for next week.\"\n\nHull KR head coach Willie Peters told BBC Radio Humberside:\n\n\"I'm very frustrated. It was a really ill-disciplined performance.\n\n\"It was there to see what Mikey did. He needs to learn from what he did because it was a key moment in the game. He knows and he's owned it but I want to see some action off the back of it.\n\n\"We were in control then and then we lost control off the back of it. We didn't handle it well as a team.\n\n\"We knew exactly what they were going to bring, they were very good. They got the crowd involved and worked hard, there was no surprise there.

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): We are struggling for goalkeepers this week, if I'm being totally honest. However, to play how he played against Arsenal and make a critical save right at the end was huge. The save against Gabriel Martinelli was probably the deciding factor that got him into the team.\n\nLamare Bogarde (Aston Villa): If you looked purely at stats, you would have said Aston Villa should have absolutely thrashed Brighton...except they didn't. It was a Brighton team that played very, very well and Bogarde stood up to the task at right back. He's a midfielder by trade so to see him playing right-back - which he has done a few times this season - was fantastic.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool): Obviously gets the goal, but up at Sunderland - that wind, that crowd and the pitch was really poor - the ability to be a class above everyone else. He made sure Liverpool weren't really stretched. Defensively it was all Virgil van Dijk.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City): He looks like he's been playing for Manchester City for about eight years. Solid, composed, wonderful on the ball - he's just fitted in seamlessly. He helped City to a clean sheet in a 3-0 win against Fulham. He kept Fulham right at arm's length. Very, very good, for me.\n\nBashir Humphreys (Burnley): Probably one of the best performances of the week, and for him this season. Very strong in a tackle, offered loads going forward and defensively solid.\n\nMateus Fernandes (West Ham): He's one of those players that looks like he would infuriate me, both to play with and against. He did all the ratty things really well. He's got high energy, he's young, talented and he's the heartbeat of the team. He gets caught up sometimes in silly moments, trying to buy fouls when he doesn't really have to. I thought it was his best performance for West Ham this season - a very mature performance.\n\nNico O'Reilly (Manchester City): I love seeing him play in midfield. He adds the legs and energy into City's midfield - and obviously he gets his goal there as well. I feel the more he plays in his natural position - with Rodri around him - he'll be a star, not only for Manchester City but England moving forward as well.\n\nJacob Ramsey (Newcastle): When Newcastle's midfield has been torn up because of injury or suspension in the last few weeks, he's quietly gone about his business. He's been excellent and made sure he delivers in terms of performances and now goals. I think he's a real steal for Newcastle.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): I'm going to give a sympathy vote to Cole Palmer. He was in there last week because he scored a hat-trick against Wolves - but this week: goal, assist, and is a level above everyone else - but what a miss that was. If he scores that goal, Chelsea obviously win the game. He's a shoo-in. That miss does put a little stain on it, but I thought his overall performance was miles better.\n\nJoao Pedro (Chelsea): He's flying! Everyone puts that down to Liam Rosenior, but I put it down to having Cole Palmer back. Being able to have a player that can play behind him, find the passes and allows him to link up and move around, is why you're seeing the best of him. I think that is five in five now for Joao.\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen (Crystal Palace): I've been very critical of his move to Crystal Palace. I thought they got a lesser player than Jean-Philippe Mateta, however he scored two goal. Palace didn't win, but he's off the mark. You have to say fair play, he did well.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): It was Manchester City's first opportunity in a while to play before Arsenal and pile the pressure on.\n\nPep Guardiola guided City to a 3-0 win against Fulham, dominated the game, took Erling Haaland off and rested him, and was in a position to have John Stones on the bench and not have to use him.\n\nRuben Dias was back, he got to rest Rodri, his rotation was good, and he will feel really strongly about being in a position to kick on for the rest of the season with all his players starting to come back.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Daffy Duck and Porky Pig - and AI - with his predictions for all 16 FA Cup fourth-round ties.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has a couple of very special guests for the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nHe is joined by Looney Tunes duo Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, the stars of new film 'The Day The Earth Blew Up', to make predictions for all 16 ties.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can see what AI thinks and choose your winner from each tie, below.\n\nDaffy and Porky were first drawn in the 1930s and the actor who initially voiced Porky had a stammer, and therefore so did the character.\n\nHi Daffy and hello Porky. This weekend it's the FA Cup - a historic competition famous for upsets and under-dogs - or is it under-ducks? - where the top Premier League teams sometimes lose to part-time sides. Are you excited about it!?\n\nDaffy: Are you kidding? I'm tho exthited. It'th incredible. Thtupendous! And the only thing that could make me more exthited is if I knew what the heck it was!\n\nPorky: I love sp-sp-sp-all kinds of athletic competition but I mostly play b-baseball and basketball, so I just hope the best team wins.\n\nThe FA Cup started in 1871 so it's even older than both of you... could we trust the pair of you if we gave you the job of looking after the famous old trophy together?\n\nDaffy: But of courth - there's no one more truthtworthy than me - and to prove it I'll take your cup far far far over yonder for thafe-keeping...\n\nPorky: Daffy, that's not the trophy that's a t-t-ttea cup. The British love drinking tea.\n\nDaffy: Oh. Wise guys, huh? Wathting my time!\n\nYou both have to save the world in 'The Day The Earth Blew Up' but this is an even bigger challenge - can you get better of our pundit and football expert Chris Sutton at predictions by picking the right scores? How confident are both of you about beating him?\n\nDaffy: You want a prediction? My prediction is we will dethtroy him! Annihilate him! Crush him! Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: He he, now d-don't get carried away, Daffy. Nothing wrong with a little friendly competition, but it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you p-p-play the game. All that matters is that we all have fu-fu-fu-fu... a good time!\n\nDaffy, you asked for Michael Jordan's autograph in Space Jam, would you want Chris' autograph? He won the Premier League in 1995... but he can be a bit of a know-it-all and even a little boastful at times, a bit like Foghorn Leghorn. Are you impressed, and what would you tell him if you met him?\n\nDaffy: As a perthon of great refinement, delicathy and modethty, I have no time for boathtful people. They're dethpicable. I find the best way to deal with them ith to whack 'em over the head with a plank. Do you have any plankth I could use?\n\nPorky, you have to deal with Daffy's short fuse and madcap ideas... how would you feel about having Chris as a sidekick instead? Would you be as loyal to him as you are to Daffy?\n\nPorky: Well, I pp-pride myself on being lo-lo-lo—faithful... but I would consider having a less Daffy and messy housemate!\n\nYou've both played basketball with the rest of the Tune Squad in the Space Jam movies, would you fancy a go at soccer (or football as we call it in the UK)?\n\nDaffy: I helped defeat a team of alien 'Monstars'. It really wouldn't be fair to your little thoccer teams to take on thuch a thupreme athlete as mythelf.\n\nPorky: I think I'd p-p-prefer to be the referee. I like the whistle.\n\nMaybe both of you would be better as managers - together as a double-act to make the big decisions? Some managers are loyal and optimistic like Porky... some are more desperate for attention, like Daffy?\n\nDaffy: With my unique combination of thkill and thrategy I think I could be a great player and a coach. At the thame time. And thell the refreshments and merchandithe. I thee it now - Daffy Thtadium - home of Daffy United!\n\nPorky: I've been a successful t-t-talent agent, so I think I would make a good ma-ma-ma-ma- head coach. I've been learning the offside rule. Let me read b-b-back my notes. \"If a player scores a g-g-goal and you don't want it to count, that's offside.\"\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\n4th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior is really well thought of by Hull fans from his time in charge there, and he is a former Tigers player as well.\n\nSo, he should get a great reception there on Friday night, but what he really needs is a win - especially after letting a two-goal lead slip against Leeds on Tuesday.\n\nRosenior has had some great results with Chelsea but it seems some fans aren't convinced by him. He will be desperate to prove them wrong by winning a trophy and the FA Cup is a great opportunity for him to do that this season.\n\nHull are going well in the Championship under Sergej Jakirovic but I just see Chelsea being too strong for them.\n\nI scored for Chelsea against Hull in the FA Cup, many years ago. We won 6-1 that day and Chelsea are going to win comfortably this time too.\n\nDaffy: Should be a hulluva a game. Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: I guess Chelsea will have to g-g-go to Hull and back.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n6th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\n\nBoth teams are in the thick of the promotion race, and they meet again in Wales in the league next weekend.\n\nWith that in mind, I just wonder whether Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna will be the one to change things up here.\n\nI hope he doesn't but I think he might, because his side are in reach of the automatic spots, and that would be Wrexham's chance.\n\nEven so, I think this will be close. I'd normally just tip Ipswich to lose anyway but this prediction is for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who is a big fan and will be delighted that I am backing them.\n\nAs for moneybags Wrexham, well I don't think their Hollywood stardust will help to take them to Wembley, but after this they will be able to focus on their play-off bid.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Ipswich win on penalties\n\nDaffy: Ipswich Town wrecks'em? Well they should be more careful with their Tractorth!\n\nPorky: I think we have to say Hooray for Ho-Holl-holl-holl-Tinseltown and go with Wrexham.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n22nd in League One v 18th in Premier League\n\nBurton are struggling in League One, with only one win in their past nine league games, but they have scored 14 goals in their three FA Cup wins to get this far, and I can see them scoring again at home here.\n\nI don't think we will see a shock, though. West Ham look like they have turned a bit of a corner, and they will be gutted to have conceded an equaliser so late on against Manchester United on Tuesday.\n\nHammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo won't want to lose the momentum that they've built in the past few weeks so, while he might make a couple of changes, he will still pick a team strong enough to get through.\n\nDaffy, when told that West Ham's famous song is 'we're forever blowing bubbles': No thir, no bubbleth, no way. Not after we went through with the zombie bubble gum. I'm going with Burton Albion (whatever that means).\n\nPorky: Yes, I don't want to b-b-b-bur- pop anyone's balloon, but I agree with Daffy. Bub-bub-bubbles can be tough to b-b-beat though. I think it will be tight.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 2-1\n\n19th in Premier League v 12th in League One\n\nAs I said on the Monday Night Club, I feel like some Burnley fans are forgetting how difficult it is for any promoted team in the Premier League. They look at how Sunderland and Leeds are doing, and think 'why not us?'\n\nClarets boss Scott Parker is taking a lot of flak at the moment, so he really needed Wednesday's win over Crystal Palace. That was a great result but he cannot afford to follow it by slipping up at home to a mid-table League One side.\n\nI am not expecting that to happen here - Burnley were up against an in-form Millwall side in round three and brushed them aside.\n\nBut I do think we will see some goals and some entertainment - there has not been much of either at Turf Moor this season. Mansfield beat Sheffield United 4-3 in the last round, and I can see them going out all guns blazing.\n\nDaffy: I think you're jutht making teamth up now.\n\nPorky: I'll support b-b-b-b-b-oh forget it - Mansfield.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n2nd in Premier League v 6th in League Two\n\nManchester City beat Salford City 8-0 in last season's FA Cup and the only thing I am not sure about here is how many they will score this time.\n\nSalford are doing well in League Two and I like their manager, Karl Robinson, but they are going to be outclassed.\n\nDaffy: I've heard of Manchethter... which is more than I can say for the otherth.\n\nPorky: Th-th-th-that's good enough for me!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-0\n\n16th in Championship v 19th in Championship\n\nThis prediction is not quite as straightforward as just looking at recent form. West Brom are really struggling while Norwich are flying - and beat the Baggies 5-0 on 20 January - but my old club have got so many injuries at the moment.\n\nI am still going to back Norwich here though. Philippe Clement has got the team playing really well and it was great to see Mohamed Toure hit a hat-trick on his first start for the club, against Oxford on Tuesday.\n\nClement says they showed Toure images of Erling Haaland beforehand to show how he creates space for himself, and Romelu Lukaku to see how he uses his body.\n\nI'm sure someone at Carrow Road could dig out some old VHS tapes of me in action for the Canaries if Toure needs any more inspiration. Although finding a video to play them on might be tricky.\n\nDaffy, when told Norwich are Chris Sutton's old team: You keep talking about thith Crith Thutton like I'm thupposed to care about him. Jutht for that I'm picking the Women's Basketball Association.\n\nPorky: No, Daffy it says here that WBA is West Bromwich Albion.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. What about Eatht Bromwich and North Bromwich, and Thouth Bromwich. That'th a lot of Bromwich!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-2\n\n24th in League One v 8th in Championship\n\nPort Vale are toiling at the bottom of League One. Bristol City have been a bit erratic too, but they are still only a point off the Championship play-off places.\n\nCity have got a huge game coming up at Wrexham on Tuesday, which might be a bit of a distraction for this tie, but I still see them reaching round five.\n\nDaffy: Doeth everyone in thith country have their own team? How many more are there?\n\nPorky: B-B-Bristol sounds like bristle. And pigs have bristles so...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2\n\n9th in Championship v 21st in Championship\n\nIt was absolutely unbelievable what happened when these two teams met in the league on Tuesday. Leicester were 3-0 up at half-time, but ended up losing 4-3 in the 97th minute.\n\nHow do the Foxes come back from that? I don't think they will. They will be angry, and are bound to be fired up, but you just wonder what damage it has done to their confidence and morale.\n\nLeicester had a points deduction last week which left them in big trouble at the bottom of the table and they don't have a manager at the moment - Andy King is caretaker boss and at half-time you can just imagine how he feels too.\n\nSouthampton are one of the form teams in the division, with four wins in their past five games, and I don't see Leicester getting any revenge here.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. Thouthhampton or Lie-theth-ter...\n\nPorky: It's pr-pr-pronounced \"Lester\"\n\nDaffy: What is wrong with you people? Can't you thpell?? In that cathe...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n3rd in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI was delighted for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe that his team beat Tottenham and also the reception he got from his side's fans afterwards.\n\nFor everything he has done for them, the world must have gone bonkers for their fans to be calling up 606 and saying they wanted him out.\n\nThis will be a very different test to playing Spurs, however, and I am going with my gut feeling on this one.\n\nThe two sides met recently when Villa won at St James' Park at the end of January and although Villa have slipped up a couple of times at home recently, when it clicks for them, they usually end up winning.\n\nDaffy, when told Newcastle are known as the 'Toon' by their fans, who are 'The Toon Army': You had me at Toon! Though I do like the thound of thtaying in a nithe villa.\n\nPorky: Remember Space Jam? No one can beat toons!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2 (And th-th-th-that's gonna be all folks!)\n\n6th in Premier League v 14th in Premier League\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler are both under pressure but it feels like Hurzeler has the bigger problems to solve.\n\nBrighton are on a poor run and apparently it all got a bit ugly at their home defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday. The fans seem to have lost faith in him, and although that feels harsh to me, when it happens then it it is hard to reverse it.\n\nThe Seagulls beat Manchester United away in round three and now Hurzeler could really do with beating Liverpool away too.\n\nI wouldn't put it past them, either, especially with Liverpool struggling to see out games at the moment, but I think Slot's side will just about get over the line.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Liverpool to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Liverpool, home of The Beatleth - finally thomewhere I've heard of!\n\nPorky: Someone told me, \"if you don't know anything about foo-foo-foo-soccer, just say you support Liverpool.\"\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 4-1\n\n10th in Championship v 15th in Premier League\n\nLeeds' comeback from 2-0 down to draw at Chelsea was just extraordinary, but I can smell an upset here.\n\nI am sure Leeds boss Daniel Farke will make some changes because he will have at least half an eye on the Premier League, and their next game against Aston Villa.\n\nBirmingham are going well under Chris Davies and are unbeaten in eight games in all competitions. This seems like a good time for him to take a top-flight scalp.\n\nDaffy: I didn't know a team from Alabama could play here.\n\nPorky: I don't think it's the same one.\n\nDaffy: Birmingham all the way - woohoo!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 100-0\n\n12th in League Two v 20th in Premier League\n\nI know all about Grimsby because I was at Blundell Park for their Carabao Cup win over Manchester United earlier in the season.\n\nCould something similar happen again? Yes, definitely. There will be another cracking atmosphere and David Artell and his players will fancy another upset, I am sure of that.\n\nThis is a horrible game for Wolves, but it is an important one for their manager Rob Edwards. He needs to find a way of getting through this tie, which is something Ruben Amorim could not do with United.\n\nWolves have had a miserable season and they probably thought it couldn't get any worse - well it might.\n\nI think lightning might strike twice, and this game will end in a draw before Grimsby win the shootout, just like they did against Manchester United.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Grimsby to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Grimthby eh? Thounds grim and deprething. I'll go with the Wolves.\n\nPorky: I think they'll huff and puff and run out steam. At least I hope so.\n\n23rd in Championship v 11th in Premier League\n\nBoth of these teams got through the last round on penalties, with Oxford beating MK Dons and Sunderland overcoming Everton.\n\nI don't see Sunderland needing a shootout this time, though. Oxford are pretty woeful at the moment and have just been spanked by Norwich - they are not coming back from that.\n\nRegis le Bris will make changes but the Black Cats will still be far too strong.\n\nDaffy, when told that Sunderland are nicknamed the Black Cats - so would not get on with Tweety Pie: Birdth of a feather mutht stick together against catth!\n\nPorky: And Oxford is a place of higher ed-ed-edu-learning. So I think they'll outsmart the opposition.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n14th in Championship v 12th in Premier League\n\nStoke's boss is my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins, who is an excellent manager - he clearly learnt a lot from me - but I fancy Fulham here.\n\nI don't know what Marco Silva's situation is with Fulham and if he is leaving at the end of the season, but he will want to go out with a bang.\n\nI really like the way Silva's side play, and I wouldn't rule out the Cottagers' chances of going deep in the FA Cup this season.\n\nDaffy: I think I know which one Porky liketh here.\n\nPorky: A f-f-f-full ham? You bet!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\n1st in Premier League v 21st in League One\n\nThis is the first meeting between these two clubs since the 2014 FA Cup semi-final, when Arsenal won on penalties and Mikel Arteta scored in a shootout. The Gunners went on to beat Hull in the final.\n\nThings have changed a lot for Wigan since then, and not in a good way.\n\nThey have just sacked their manager Ryan Lowe after sliding into the League One relegation zone, and it's hard to see them forcing a shootout this time, no matter how many changes Arteta makes.\n\nArsenal have not had much joy in the FA Cup since Arteta won it again as manager in 2019-20, a few months after taking charge.\n\nThey have not been past round four since, but they are going to make it to the last 16 this time, I'm sure of it.\n\nIn fact, they have got so much strength in depth now that, while for years Arteta has not been able to win anything at all, he could feasibly win four trophies this season.\n\nIs the Quadruple on? That could be the question we are asking in the final few months of the season.\n\nDaffy: You thee, the problem with Arthenal is they just try to walk it in.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n6th in National League North v 7th in Premier League\n\nI am co-commentating on this game for 5 Live with Ali Bruce-Ball and I cannot wait.\n\nMacclesfield boss John Rooney did an incredible job with his side's historic win over Crystal Palace in round three.\n\nI watched the game back as part of my prep and, while the Silkmen had less than 29% possession, they limited Palace to very few chances and they were deserved winners.\n\nKnocking the holders out was rightly hailed as the biggest shock in the FA Cup's illustrious history, and it would be another fantastic feat if they toppled Brentford too.\n\nOnly one non-league side has ever beaten two top-flight teams in the same FA Cup campaign - Millwall in 1913-14, who overcame Chelsea and Bradford City.\n\nI'd love to think Macclesfield could do it too, and if they play like they did against Palace then they have a great chance, especially on their plastic pitch.\n\nI think Brentford will be ready for them, though, and Keith Andrews' side are having a tremendous season too.\n\nAndrews will know he can't make too many changes here, and maybe Brentford will go on an FA Cup run themselves - they have not reached the quarter-finals since 1989, so it it is long overdue.\n\nThis is going to be a tight game but I just have a feeling the Bees will edge it.\n\nDaffy: I don't underthtand thith game at all – what is a Maccle? Why are there fields of them? And why do you altho call them the Thilkmen? Jutht for that, I'm going with Brentford!\n\nPorky: B-b-Bees make honey, And honey is sweet... and so is my d-d-dear-d-d-arling Petunia.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

    "fullText": "A lot can change in sport over two decades - but not Arianna Fontana's ability to collect Olympic medals.\n\nShe had to settle for silver in the women's 500m as the title she won in 2018 and 2022 was taken by Netherlands' Xandra Velzeboer.\n\nIt was Fontana's second medal of these Games, after she helped Italy win the mixed team relay earlier this week.\n\nThe 35-year-old - the only woman to have finished on the podium in six consecutive Winter Games - now has 13 medals, equalling the tally of fencer Edoardo Mangiarotti as her country's all-time record holder at an Olympics.\n\nFontana has won at least one medal in every Olympic short track distance.\n\nIt was a magnificent full-circle - or full-oval speed skating track – moment for Fontana after she also won her first Olympic medal at a home Games - Turin 2006 - as a 15-year-old.\n\n\"I had no idea what was happening!\" Fontana told the BBC's More Than The Score podcast last week of that 2006 bronze in the 3000m relay.\n\n\"I was just living the dream. I was too young to really understand what it meant to be on the Olympic podium. Then when I went home, I had my whole hometown waiting for me.\n\n\"I am fortunate to have a home Olympics, because in Turin I couldn't really understand. To be home in Milan, it is my home region.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWhile an unknown teenager in Turin, she is one of the faces of this year's Games 20 years on. Fontana carried the Italian flag at the opening ceremony at San Siro, leading the home nation as tens of thousands of compatriots cheered in the crowd.\n\nIt was the second time Fontana was honoured to be the opening ceremony flagbearer, having also carried the flag at Pyeongchang 2018.\n\nOn how she has kept winning Olympic medals and maintained her place at the top end of speed skating since before Instagram was invented, Fontana says it comes down to a love of the sport - and a love of herself.\n\n\"I do have experience, but I have the same drive I did when I was 15. I never get on the ice just to show up,\" she added.\n\n\"With time, I have been able to understand my body, and my mental fitness - I have taken more time off from racing, more breaks, because mentally it can be tough.\n\n\"Elite athletes, we put pressure on ourselves easily, we have high expectation and it can be hard mentally.\"\n\nShe needed that mental fortitude in the build-up to the Games as a series of injuries - including a hip issue in October - hampered her preparations.\n\nIt put paid to Fontana's plan to also enter long track events, forcing her to concentrate on her signature shorter disciplines.\n\nIt was a decision she took with her coach and husband Anthony Lobello after spending four years travelling the world to various competitions.\n\n\"We understand each other, he understands exactly what I need,\" said Fontana. \"We do try not to talk about work at home.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nShe needed all her nous on Thursday night. In the semi-final, as chaos unfurled all around her at the start - including medal rival Michelle Velzeboer falling - she kept her focus and skated a clean race.\n\nAnd in the final, Fontana needed running repairs to one of her skates after a first-corner collision with Selma Poutsma meant the race was restarted.\n\nBut she kept her nerve and held off late pressure from Poutsma and Courtney Sarault to make it lucky 13.\n\nA good job, then, that she pushed away all nagging feelings that this might have been one Games too many.\n\nFontana admitted: \"Sooner or later you are going to retire, and I have spoken to athletes who have. You just feel it, you give it all, then it is time to move on.\n\n\"For sure, having the Olympic Games in Italy was another motivation, if it was in another country, I don't know.\n\n\"But I didn't have that feeling I was done.\"",

    "fullText": "SAO PAULO, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Brazil's cattle slaughtering activity for the fourth quarter shows beef packers boosted processing by 13.1% ‌from the same period in 2024, according to preliminary Brazilian census bureau ‌data released on Thursday.\n\nThe tally, if confirmed, would take Brazil's total slaughtering to 42.3 million head ​in 2025, a record, as strong Chinese demand drove an acceleration of processing and put Brazil ahead of the United States as the world's biggest beef producer.\n\nBrazil's government trade data indicates Chinese demand remained strong in January, with $650 million worth ‌of beef shipments to the ⁠Asian nation last month, almost 45% more than a year ago.\n\nOverall, Brazil sold some 232,000 metric tonnes of fresh beef ⁠to multiple destinations in 2025, generating almost $1.3 billion in revenue. China's share of Brazil's beef trade was roughly half, by value and volume.\n\nGoing forward, however, Brazilian companies may ​not ​be selling as much to their top trade ​partner, as Beijing introduced maximum annual ‌import quotas for suppliers over three years. Anything exceeding a certain threshold will be levied a 55% tariff.\n\nChina's \"safeguard measures\" spooked local processors. But as Beijing is unwavering, the Brazilian government is now discussing with the industry a plan to assign specific quotas to companies, in the same proportion as their exports to ‌China last year, to regulate supplies.\n\nDefenders of ​the move argue it could avoid upward pressure ​on cattle prices, or a ​fall of beef export prices, as local companies rush to ‌export to China to fill their quota ​faster than others. ​Detractors say it may allow unprecedented meddling with food exports.\n\nBeijing will exempt 1.106 million metric tons of Brazilian beef from additional tariffs this year. ​On average, local exporters ‌would sell some 92,000 tons monthly to China under the threshold, ​which compares with nearly 140,000 tons monthly in 2025.",

    "description": "Are you ready to retire or not? It can be difficult to answer this question. However, there are three key numbers that you need to look at which will tell you everything that you need to know about whether you are ready to retire. Here’s what they are. 1.",
    "fullText": "Before retiring, you must know your investment account balance.\n\nIt’s important to also know how much Social Security income you will receive.\n\nFinally, you need to know how much you plan to spend to make sure your income will cover your costs.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nAre you ready to retire or not? It can be difficult to answer this question. However, there are three key numbers that you need to look at which will tell you everything that you need to know about whether you are ready to retire.\n\nThe first big number that you need to know is your investment account balance. That's the amount of money that you have set aside in your 401(k), IRA, and taxable brokerage accounts. You must know this number because the money from these accounts will supplement your Social Security income.\n\nYou can't live on Social Security alone, so you should have additional savings to help you pay the bills as a retiree. Once you know the total amount you have invested, you can determine how much income your accounts will provide.\n\nExperts recommend withdrawing 3.7% of your account balance in your first year of retirement. So, if you have, say $850K in your investment accounts, you would multiply that number to determine that you would have $31,450 per year in income from savings to spend.\n\nThe next big number that you must know is the amount of your Social Security benefit. Your Social Security payment is also going to be a crucial source of retirement income and, unlike your savings, this source of funds is guaranteed to last for life and has built-in protections against inflation.\n\nYour  Social Security benefit is designed to replace around 40% of your pre-retirement income. However, for some people, it will replace more and for others, it won't replace as much Higher earners have a lower portion of their earnings replaced as the benefits formula is progressive. Your age when you claim benefits also matters, as those who file for benefits before their full retirement age are faced with penalties for early filing while those who delay past FRA get delayed retirement credits that increase benefits.\n\nWhether you claim earlier or late is going to depend on your financial situation, as well as whether you would prefer more smaller checks or fewer larger checks. If you expect a long life expectancy or need your spouse to receive a large survivor's benefit, then a delayed claim is also advisable.",

But with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City the side chasing them, that gap does not feel huge.\n\nPart of that is down to the fact that if Arsenal had beaten the Bees they would have been six points clear and had the chance to extend that to nine points with a win over Wolves next Wednesday, with the game taking place before Manchester City are next in action.\n\nAnother factor is that Manchester City have produced incredible runs of form to chase down titles in previous years and the Gunners have finished second for three successive seasons.\n\nWith 12 games to go, history does not favour Arsenal with their end-of-season form.\n\nIn the past five seasons, only on one occasion have Arsenal won 10 of their final 12 Premier League matches in a campaign.\n\nIn those seasons, the Gunners have never won more points in their final 12 games than the team that went on to win the title.\n\nLeaders Arsenal frustrated in draw at Brentford\n\nWith the noise around Arsenal and their history under Arteta when trying to win the title, the Gunners boss was asked if he needs to ensure that his side do not panic and remain focused on their task.\n\n\"That's what we have to do,\" he said. \"I mean we are going to be willing and preparing to win every single match and the only thing that we can do is focus on that and raise the levels collectively and individually to be better than the opponent every week.\n\n\"It's just the things that we have to do, that's the most important thing.\"\n\nBefore Manchester City's dramatic win against Liverpool on Sunday, it looked as though Arsenal would be nine points clear.\n\nBut after Erling Haaland's late penalty to secure the three points and their win against Fulham on Wednesday, the gap was reduced to three points and the pressure was put back on to the Gunners.\n\nWhen asked if playing after City is bringing a new pressure to his team, Arteta said: \"I don't think so, I think we played well after them a few times this season and we have won games.\"\n\nOf the 17 games in which Arsenal have scored first in the Premier League this season, the draw at Brentford was just the second time they have failed to win, along with their loss to Manchester United in January.\n\nMidfielder Declan Rice could not have put it better: \"This is a rollercoaster of a season.\n\n\"You can't be naive to think this is going to be easy. We are playing against the best teams week in, week out. We have to keep pushing and believing in ourselves, controlling the controllables.\n\n\"We have to block out the outside noise. We have done that really well. People are going to talk up the title race and Arsenal but we have a really calm group.\"\n\nThe Gunners came into this match without centre-back William Saliba, who missed out through illness.\n\nSaliba is a key part of this Arsenal side and his partnership with Gabriel Magalhaes is a big reason why they have conceded just 18 goals in the league this season.\n\nSince the start of 2022-23, Arsenal have a 68.6% win rate and average 2.3 points per game with Saliba playing in the Premier League (W83 D24 L14), compared to a 42.1% win rate and 1.6 points per game on average without him (W8 D7 L4).\n\nThe Gunners are also without Kai Havertz, who has picked up a muscle injury after only just returning from a long-term knee issue last month.\n\nAs well as those two changes, Arteta brought Viktor Gyokeres and Piero Hincapie into the starting XI at Brentford.\n\nBut the Gunners have only won two of the past seven Premier League games in which they've made four or more changes to their starting XI from the previous match (D4 L1).\n\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on TNT Sports: \"That's what people were shouting at me as I was coming off the pitch, 'Man City are coming to get you', but at the end of the day Arsenal are four points clear.\n\n\"You get knocked down, you get up again. Let's see who the fighters are and let's see who is going to win this. They could have put down a big marker if they won the match, but it never looked like that was going to be the case.\"\n\nIn two of their three second-placed finishes in recent years, Arsenal have finished behind Manchester City, which is why the talk about this title race carries so many emotional scars for supporters.\n\n\"What Man City have got is the know-how and the recent history behind them,\" Peter Crouch added on TNT.\n\n\"That can lead to nervous tensions around the stadium, certainly around the back end of the season.\n\n\"Having someone like Man City and Pep behind you, you are always going to be looking over your shoulder. But you would much rather be in Arsenal's position.\"\n\nCrouch believes Arsenal will never have a better chance to win the title.\n\n\"Man City are not the Man City of old, Liverpool aren't, Manchester United aren't what they have been, Chelsea the same,\" he said. \"There is a lack of quality in the top areas [of the league]. The bar has been set high in the past years.\n\n\"Now is a real opportunity for Arsenal. If they don't get over the line, there needs to be more questions answered.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Thomas Tuchel says he extended his contract as England manager through to Euro 2028 because of the \"amazing group of players\" at his disposal.",
    "fullText": "Thomas Tuchel says he extended his contract as England manager through to Euro 2028 because of the \"amazing group of players\" at his disposal.\n\nThe German took charge in January 2025 and his time as Three Lions boss had originally been set to end after this summer's World Cup.\n\nHowever, the 52-year-old admitted his \"connection to the players and to the job itself\" had grown as England claimed eight wins from eight matches to waltz through qualifying for the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n\n\"The main reasons I took the job in the first place were the players,\" Tuchel said.\n\n\"I wanted to be around this amazing group of players. I wanted to coach these characters that I already knew from the Premier League.\n\n\"I love the group of players. I love the characters, I love being in charge. I felt the passion in the country when the Euros were held at Wembley. From there it was more a dream than a reality.\n\n\"I'm very grateful for the support and trust of the FA and we will put all the effort in to make everyone proud and to keep on going.\"\n\nWhen Tuchel accepted the England job, it was his first incursion into the international arena.\n\nHaving enjoyed success with the likes of Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, he has adapted seamlessly to a different type of challenge away from the day-to-day issues he faced at clubs.\n\n\"We didn't know exactly what was coming as an international manager,\" Tuchel added.\n\n\"It was basically the point why I voted strongly for only 18 months contract in the first place, because I said 'Listen, I have never done this. Can I first make sure that I love this and that I feel committed to the team, and I feel connected to the team', because I think that is needed to be the best version of myself.\n\n\"It took me some months to understand it but as soon as the more condensed period arrived in September, October, November, it was the period where I felt the strongest connection to the players and to the job itself. And from there on I was fully committed to go even further.\"\n\nWith the 2028 European Championship finals being hosted by England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, the temptation of leading a side into a home Euros, with the Football Association keen to back their man, also proved an irresistible reason for Tuchel to stay on.\n\n\"We had an excellent qualifying campaign, and both sides wanted to complete the cycle,\" he added.\n\n\"We wanted to commit further to a full cycle of World Cup and Euros. The FA wanted and I wanted so it was an easy one.\"\n\nWhile some may draw parallels to the situation England faced after handing Fabio Capello a lucrative new deal prior to 2010 World Cup in South Africa, there can be no question that the FA's move does at least provide some continuity and clarity in the short to medium term.\n\nHaving been strongly linked with Manchester United, where Michael Carrick is in charge until the end of the season, both Tuchel and the FA appear content to have removed any potential distractions heading into the World Cup.\n\n\"It didn't have to be done, but it was a very positive, very welcome side-effect of it,\" Tuchel added.\n\n\"It was the opposite, very important for me that we don't do it just to have clarity in the World Cup, but we do it if we are convinced, and [FA CEO] Mark Bullingham especially made this very clear from the beginning.\n\n\"But it is, no doubt, a very welcome side-effect that we have clarity, no more speculation, no more rumours.\n\n\"There was no reason to be worried because I was obviously totally focused through the qualification period and right after that we started the talks. I was always committed to this idea of extending the contract, the FA were always committed - there were no games, no second thoughts.\n\n\"There is a possibility that I will be tempted to go back to club football but not in the next two-and-a-half years.\"\n\nWith question marks removed over his own future, Tuchel will soon have to navigate the recurring issues his predecessors have faced leading England into major tournaments.\n\nThat includes managing expectation levels and selection connundrums that appear to be commonplace whenever England are readying themselves for a World Cup or Euros.\n\nAnd he appears to be relishing the prospect of making those decisions with Manchester United trio Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw all likely to come into his thinking, having not featured under the German so far.\n\nA change of manager and system has allowed Mainoo - a starter in the Euro 2024 final - to showcase his talent again after he was mystifyingly banished from United's starting XI under former boss Ruben Amorim.\n\nMeanwhile, Shaw and Maguire have impressed under Carrick, with Tuchel assessing all three players in United's 1-1 draw at West Ham on Tuesday.\n\nWhen questioned about Mainoo, Tuchel continued: \"Absolutely back in the frame! First of all, it is great that he is back on the pitch. He is such a huge talent.\n\n\"He has already played a tournament from start to finish for England, so he is back in the picture, so is Luke Shaw and so is Harry Maguire.\n\n\"There are some players suddenly back in the picture, they play a back four now and play with a different style which is a bit easier to translate to our structure at the moment. It's good competition.\"",

    "description": "Seventeen-year-old Choi Ga-on denies American great Chloe Kim snowboarding history as she brushes off an early fall to win Winter Olympic halfpipe gold.",
    "fullText": "It felt like the moment the baton was passed on.\n\nChloe Kim, the greatest women's halfpipe snowboarder, and Choi Ga-on, the young protege, standing side by side on the podium.\n\nIt was expected to be a procession for American Kim to win a third consecutive Winter Olympic gold, a feat no snowboarder has ever achieved. And yet it was 17-year-old Choi on the top step at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe South Korean had defied a brutal fall in her opening run to score 90.25 points on her final attempt, a total 25-year-old Kim could not better.\n\nIt was, as Kim told BBC Sport, a \"full circle moment\".\n\nThe two had met nine years ago, at a test event in Pyeongchang before the 2018 Games in which Kim, then also aged 17, would announce herself on a global stage with her first Olympic gold.\n\nRealising her potential, Kim and her father helped Choi to travel to the United States to train.\n\nKim's father, who is from South Korea, was one of the first to embrace Choi and her emotional team after her Olympic gold was confirmed.\n\n\"She's someone I've known since she was little,\" said Kim.\n\n\"It's such a full circle moment seeing her from when she was so young to now standing next to her on the Olympic podium.\"\n\nOlympic gold in Italy marks the realisation of Choi's potential, a name that has been on the lips of many in the snowboard world for some time but is now catapulted into global consciousness.\n\nIn 2023, aged just 14, Choi won X Games superpipe gold, breaking Kim's record as the youngest rider to win the title.\n\nThat same year, she won the first World Cup she entered but was later ruled out of the remainder of that season after fracturing her back.\n\nThis Olympic season, however, she underlined her ability by winning every World Cup she entered coming into the Games.\n\nShe had managed only sixth in qualification on Wednesday as Kim topped the pile with a score of 90.25 - the exact score Choi would win gold with little more than 24 hours later.\n\nBut her final looked to be over on her very first run when she hit the icy lip of the pipe and flipped into its centre, lying motionless for some time.\n\nAs heavy snow fell, she eventually brushed herself down and later stunned the onlooking crowd with her spellbinding third run, her coach bursting into tears at the realisation of what Choi had achieved.\n\n\"It's the kind of story you only see in dreams, so I'm incredibly happy,\" said Choi.\n\n\"During the final, mentally it was so tough. But right now I am the happiest.\n\n\"My knees are a bit bad, but I feel like I'm overcoming it all with happiness.\"\n\nShe later said: \"After the first run, I actually cried really hard, thinking maybe I should just quit the Olympics here.\n\n\"I cried because I thought I wouldn't be able to compete. But the thought kept coming back to me: 'You can do this. You have to go on'. That's what pushed me forward.\"\n\nFor Kim, the build-up to the Games had been far from ideal.\n\nWith just one competition under her belt this season, she dislocated her shoulder and sustained a torn labrum in what she described as the \"silliest fall\" in training in Switzerland last month.\n\nIn Livigno she was competing with her shoulder in a brace but showed little sign of it affecting her.\n\nWatched on by Team USA 'honorary coach' Snoop Dogg and snowboarding legend Shaun White in Thursday's final, the eight-time X Games champion had looked set for gold after her opening run scored 88.00, with few coming close.\n\nBut Choi's last score, met by both cheers and gasps of shock from the onlooking crowd, piled the pressure on Kim, only for a fall - one of many in what was a chaotic final - to ensure she would leave an Olympics with silver for the very first time.\n\nJapan's Mitsuki Ono took bronze with a score of 85.00.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, Kim - who will now have surgery on her shoulder - said: \"I'm so proud of myself.\n\n\"There was a lot of conversation about me [attempting to win a third gold] but honestly I'm just so glad I was able to get here.\n\n\"I think this one might mean more than the others. I think I put it all out there.\n\n\"In the past, I would take a cautious approach and ride to win, but these days I've just wanted to do what felt good and I feel like I really gave it my all.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Gerwyn Price ended Michael van Gerwen's unbeaten start to the Premier League by claiming a 6-3 victory in night two's final in Antwerp.\n\nVan Gerwen won the season opener in Newcastle last week and beat Luke Littler in the semis on his way to another final.\n\nBut the seven-time champion was no match for Welshman Price, who had come through two final-leg deciders before lifting the title in more comfortable fashion.\n\nLittler had earlier opened the tournament's first visit to Belgium by edging a final-leg decider of his own against rival Luke Humphries.\n\nFor Price it was a welcome victory to confirm the fine form he had been in of late.\n\n\"I think I'm playing some of the best stuff I've played, I'm just not winning tournaments,\" Price told Sky Sports after his victory.\n\n\"There's no way I can't win a major, bigger Pro Tours, Europeans. Averages are just for show and if you play well on your darts and win matches you win tournaments. I'm going to get some.\"\n\nThe PDC Premier League visited Belgium for the first time in the competition's 21-year history, and the 10,000 darts fanatics inside the AFAS Dome were treated to plenty of thrills.\n\nPremier League Darts 2026 fixtures, results and table\n\nPremier League: Price beats Van Gerwen to win Antwerp final - as it happened\n\nThe night started with a bang as the two biggest darts stars in the world played out a high-quality contest that went down to a final-leg decider.\n\nHumphries and Littler both hit seven 180s and averaged over 102 and 105 respectively, but both were surprisingly poor on the outer ring - missing 28 doubles between them.\n\nHumphries was the better player throughout, but at 4-1 up he started missing doubles badly, 17 in all by the end of the match, as Littler engineered an escape to make it five straight wins against his big rival.\n\nWorld number two Humphries has now lost 11 of his 15 Premier League meetings with Littler, with his last victory of any kind against the 19-year-old coming in the tournament's final last May.\n\nThe past four defeats before this one came in tournament finals, and perhaps it is becoming a mental barrier now for the defending Premier League champion as his scoring was solid all game, but he could just not get over the line.\n\nComebacks were a theme of the opening quarter-finals with all bar Van Gerwen's stroll against an out-of-sorts Josh Rock filled with excitement.\n\nStephen Bunting finished bottom of the table last year after failing to win a single match in the first eight weeks, but looked to have one sewn up when leading 4-0, only to watch Jonny Clayton reel off six straight legs to win 6-4.\n\nAnd Price had to come from 3-1 and 4-2 down to beat Gian van Veen in the first of his two 6-5 victories on the night.\n\nPrice's second final-leg decider came against good friend and Wales World Cup team-mate Clayton in a nip-and-tuck battle.\n\nPrice had four 180s to Clayton's three and averaged just over 100 - but was forced to win the final two legs under extreme pressure to make the final.\n\nIt was no real surprise given Price had won nine in a row against his compatriot and 15 of their past 16 meetings.\n\nVan Gerwen did not impress in his opener but certainly did in a strange 6-4 victory over Littler where seven of the 10 legs went against the darts.\n\nThe Dutchman averaged just over 100 with an off-colour Littler down at 95 and - strangely for him - only managing a single maximum, while Van Gerwen hit four.\n\nBut it was the finishing under pressure that made the difference as the Dutchman hit six of 13 attempts at a double, including finishing off a 10-darter, in a performance that was much more like the Van Gerwen of old.\n\nDespite incredible back-to-back finishes of 167 and 160 in the final Van Gerwen was always second best, but a win and a final after two nights is a great start considering he failed to win a single night in last season's competition.\n\nThe results also leave Littler and Humphries in fifth and sixth in the table with just one win each, but there is no panic just yet with 14 weeks of fixtures remaining.\n\nThursday, 12 February - FAS Dome, Antwerp\n\nLuke Littler 6-5 Luke Humphries\n\nMichael van Gerwen 6-2 Josh Rock\n\nJonny Clayton 6-4 Stephen Bunting\n\nPremier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night.\n\nEach of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.\n\nPlayers earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.\n\nThe top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.\n\nIf players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.\n\nThursday, 19 February - OVO Hydro, Glasgow\n\nStephen Bunting v Gian van Veen\n\nMichael van Gerwen v Luke Littler\n\nBunting/Van Veen v Humphries/Rock\n\nVan Gerwen/Littler v Clayton/Price\n\nBunting/Van Veen/Humphries/Rock v Van Gerwen/Littler/Clayton/Price",

However, residents will still have the use of driveways, loading zones, fire hydrants, bus stops, handicap ramps and parking spots in the area, as those will not be blocked.\n\nMore: How an actor found TikTok fame reviewing Peoria restaurants\n\nThe site was formerly home to Tabernacle of Praise Fellowship Church and St. Andrew the Apostle Episcopal Church, but is currently vacant at this time.

The former church, built in 1897, is currently on the market for $289,000, according to real estate listings.\n\nAnyone with further information on the filming is asked to contact Stacy Peterson, the city's strategic communications manager, at (309) 494-8560.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Journal Star: Movie scenes will be filmed at this former Peoria church",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 12 (Reuters) - China's chief trade negotiator Li Chenggang met Mexico's Deputy Economy Minister Vidal Llerenas in Beijing on Monday, in ‌the first face-to-face talks since Mexico imposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports, ‌drawing warnings from Beijing.\n\nThe two countries conducted in-depth exchanges on bilateral economic and trade relations and ​other issues, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHow do USMCA negotiations affect Chinese investment plans?\n\nHow might China respond to Mexico's tariff increases?\n\nWhy did Mexico impose higher tariffs on China?\n\nWhat impact could tariffs have on China-Mexico trade?\n\nMexico announced in December steep tariff increases on China and other countries without free trade agreements with Mexico - most up to 35%. The move was widely interpreted by analysts as an attempt ‌to placate U.S. President Donald ⁠Trump, who levied significant tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nMexico's duties apply to thousands of goods including automobiles, auto parts, textiles, clothing, plastics and ⁠steel.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the tariffs are intended to increase domestic production and address trade imbalances. The tariffs are expected to have the biggest impact on China, which ​is Mexico's ​second-largest trading partner after the United States.\n\nChina's ​Commerce Ministry had warned Mexico to \"think ‌twice\" before levying tariffs and said it would take steps in response to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, but it has so far not announced countermeasures.\n\nSeparately, China's top automaker BYD said in 2024 it was considering setting up a factory in Mexico, although the FT reported in March that China was delaying approval for ‌the plant over concerns of technology leakage to ​the United States.\n\nThe China-Mexico talks come as the ​U.S., Mexico and Canada prepare to ​jointly review their free trade agreement by July 1.\n\nThe U.S.' top ‌trade negotiator has said the pact ​is not equipped to ​deal with surges of exports and investment from non-market economies such as China into the region, suggesting the U.S. may press for tighter rules on ​China-origin goods in a ‌new agreement. That would make it harder for Chinese firms to use ​Mexico as a base for exporting to the U.S.",

Right. We need Correct. Correct.\n\nWhat are the what what could be that catalyst?\n\nSo, you know, some people thought uh FTX. Uh, maybe there's another similar type of thing out there.\n\nLike there's a blow up waiting in the wings somewhere.\n\nYeah, like, you know, most people have said that the acceleration down really started after October 10th. You know, October 10th there was a flash crash.\n\nAnd we're we've had flash crashes in the traditional markets. I was in the hedge fund business in the old world for 25 years. I saw many flash crashes. They're normal.\n\nAnd in crypto, you've have flash crashes all the time. It used to be, I don't know if you remember but in 2016, 17, 18, Coinbase would go down and people would say, oh, Coinbase is down and you would have a flash crash.\n\nAnd so we had a very severe moment on October 10th that is yet to be sort of resolved. The person who was maybe forced to liquidate, uh or the entity that was forced to liquidate, uh it seems is still, uh, is still liquidating. Maybe there is an entity, maybe there isn't. We don't know, but I think um there has to be sort of a capitulative moment, a moment of realization where people say, oh my goodness,\n\nit's over. And we've already been seeing that, oh Bitcoin's going to zero. Someone asked me the other day at dinner whether Bitcoin was going to zero. Um, so it's sort of unfortunate, but that's sort of the way markets work.

    "fullText": "Oklahoma City residents may have driven by the intersection of north Western Avenue and NW 192nd Street and wondered what’s being constructed there.\n\nBraum’s in January 2025 filed a permit at 1021 NW 192nd Street to build what will be one of the larger stores in its footprint.\n\nAccording to permits filed with the City of Oklahoma City, Braum’s is building a nearly 6,500-square-foot store. It’s a job with an estimated value of $2.5 million, the permit shows.\n\nThere are 326 Braum's stores in the U.S. as of Feb. 11, and Oklahoma has 146 of them, or about 45% of all locations nationally, data provided by the company.\n\nWith most Braum’s stores ranging from 5,500-6,500 square feet, the location being built on 192nd Street would be one of the largest in Oklahoma.\n\nThe Express Star reported in 2021 that Braum’s opened the largest location in Oklahoma at 3001 S. Sara Rd. The report states that location is just under 6,500 square feet, with seating for about 70 guests and an outdoor covered patio that accommodates roughly 40 patrons.\n\nThe 192nd Street location is of comparable size at 6,456 square feet.\n\nBraum’s leadership, according to reports, has increased the size of new stores since the 2000s to accommodate their expanded Fresh Market grocery sections, which feature wider aisles and an increased variety of product options.\n\nThe markets inside the stores are among the qualities that separate the brand from other fast-food options.\n\nThe layout seen in Yukon and in Wolfforth, Texas, dedicates more than 1,600 square feet to the market area alone. Both of those locations have 16.5-foot ceilings, the largest in the company’s footprint.\n\nBraum's Public Relations Director Amanda Beuchaw said the new store in Oklahoma City will be the same store model as seen in Yukon and just outside of Lubbock, Texas.\n\n\"The (store size) mostly has to do with the lot size,\" Beuchaw said. \"If the lot is big enough to support it, they love to use the big model as much as they can because they really like the look and aesthetic of that model. But it has to do with the lot being able support that size of a store as well as the parking lot and the spaces needed.\"\n\nBeuchaw said the company hopes to open the new location sometime before June 2026, but that will ultimately depend on weather and material delays, among other factors.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Oklahoman: Oklahoma City's new Braum's store will be one of the largest in the state",

    "description": "The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family.",
    "fullText": "The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family. The decision likely ends a bitter, yearslong legal battle over the girl's fate.\n\nIn 2020, a judge in Fluvanna County, Virginia, granted Joshua and Stephanie Mast an adoption of the child, who was then 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan living with a family the Afghan government decided were her relatives.\n\nFour justices on the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday signed onto an opinion reversing two lower courts’ rulings that found the adoption was so flawed it was void from the moment it was issued.\n\nThe justices wrote that a Virginia law that cements adoption orders after six months bars the child’s Afghan relatives from challenging the court, no matter how flawed its orders and even if the adoption was obtained by fraud.\n\nThree justices issued a scathing dissent, calling what happened in this court “wrong,” “cancerous” and “like a house built on a rotten foundation.”\n\nAn attorney for the Masts declined to comment, citing an order from the circuit court not to discuss the details of the case publicly. Lawyers representing the Afghan family said they were not yet prepared to comment.\n\nThe child was injured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in September 2019 when U.S. soldiers raided a rural compound. The child’s parents and siblings were killed. Soldiers brought her to a hospital at an American military base.\n\nThe raid was targeting terrorists who had come into Afghanistan from a neighboring country; some believed she was not Afghan and tried to make a case for bringing her to the U.S. But the State Department, under President Donald Trump’s first administration, insisted the U.S. was obligated under international law to work with the Afghan government and the International Committee of the Red Cross to unite the child with her closest surviving relatives.\n\nThe Afghan government determined she was Afghan and vetted a man who claimed to be her uncle. The U.S. government agreed and brought her to the family. The uncle chose to give her to his son and his new wife, who raised her for 18 months in Afghanistan.\n\nMeanwhile, Mast and his wife convinced courts in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia, to grant them custody and then a series of adoption orders, continuing to claim she was the “stateless” daughter of foreign fighters.\n\nJudge Richard Moore granted them a final adoption in December 2020. When the six-month statute of limitations ran out, the child was still in Afghanistan living with her relatives, who testified they had no idea a judge was giving the girl to another family. Mast contacted them through intermediaries and tried to get them to send the girl to the U.S. for medical treatment but they refused to let her go alone.\n\nWhen the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban took over, the family agreed to leave and Mast worked his military contacts to get them on an evacuation flight. Mast then took the baby from them at a refugee resettlement center in Virginia, and they haven’t seen her since.\n\nThe AP agreed not to name the Afghan couple because they fear their families in Afghanistan might face retaliation from the Taliban. The circuit court issued a protective order shielding their identities.\n\nThe Afghans challenged the adoption, claiming the court had no authority over a foreign child and the adoption orders were based on Mast repeatedly misleading the judge.\n\nThe Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday wrote that the law prohibiting challenges to an adoption after six months is designed to create permanency, so a child is not bounced from one home to another. The only way to undercut it is to argue that a parent’s constitutional rights were violated.\n\nThe lower courts had found that the Afghan couple had a right to challenge the adoption because they were the girl’s “de facto” parents when they came to the United States.\n\nFour of the Supreme Court judges — D. Arthur Kelsey, Stephen R. McCullough, Teresa M. Chafin, Wesley G. Russell Jr. — disagreed.\n\n“We find no legal merit” in the argument that “that they were ‘de facto’ parents of the child and that no American court could constitutionally sever that relationship,” they wrote. They pointed to Fluvanna County Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore’s findings that the Afghan couple “are not and never were parents” of the child, because they had no order from an Afghan court and had not proven any biological relationship to her.\n\nThe Afghans had refused DNA testing, saying it could not reliably prove a familial connection between opposite-gender half-cousins. They insisted that it didn't matter, because Afghanistan claimed the girl as its citizen and got to determine her next-of-kin.\n\nThe Supreme Court leaned heavily on a 38-page document written by Judge Moore, who granted the adoption, then presided over a dozen hearings after the Afghans challenged it. He wrote that he trusted the Masts more than the Afghans, and believed that the Masts’ motivations were noble while the Afghans were misrepresenting their relationship to the child.\n\nThe Supreme Court also dismissed the federal government’s long insistence that Trump’s first administration had made a foreign policy decision to unite her with her Afghan relatives, and a court in Virginia has no authority to undo it. The government submitted filings in court predicting dire outcomes if the baby was allowed to remain with the Marine: it could be viewed as “endorsing an act of international child abduction,” threaten international security pacts and be used as propaganda by Islamic extremists — potentially endangering U.S soldiers overseas.\n\nBut the Justice Department in Trump’s second administration abruptly changed course.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted in its opinion that the Justice Department had been granted permission to make arguments in the case, but withdrew its request to do so on the morning of oral arguments last year, saying it “has now had an opportunity to reevaluate its position in this case.”\n\nThe Supreme Court returned repeatedly to Moore’s finding that giving the girl to the family “was not a decision the United States initiated, but rather consented to or acquiesced in.”\n\nThe three judges who dissented were unsparing in their criticism of both the Masts and the circuit court that granted him the adoption.\n\n“A dispassionate review of this case reveals a scenario suffused with arrogance and privilege. Worse, it appears to have worked,” begins the dissent, written by Justice Thomas P. Mann, and signed by Chief Justice Cleo E. Powell and LeRoy F. Millette, Jr.\n\nA Virginia court never had the right to give the child to the Masts, the dissent said.\n\nThey castigated the Masts for “brazenly” misleading the courts during their quest to adopt the girl.\n\n“We must recognize what an adoption really is: the severance and termination of the rights naturally flowing to an otherwise legitimate claimant to parental authority. Of course, the process must be impeccable. An evolved society could not sanction anything less than that. And here, it was less,” Mann wrote. “If this process was represented by a straight line, (the Masts) went above it, under it, around it, and then blasted right through it until there was no line at all — just fragments collapsing into a cavity.”",
