Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nChris Paul deserved a better ending than this.\n\nThe surefire Hall of Fame point guard, dubbed \"Point God,\" has retired from the NBA on Friday after being waived by the Toronto Raptors. And this season didn't go how anyone would've drawn it up.\n\nHe rejoined the Los Angeles Clippers in the offseason, a fun reunion with the team he had turned into Lob City.\n\nPaul started every game a season ago for the San Antonio Spurs. No one was under the illusion that he was at his peak, but he seemed to still be a productive NBA player.\n\nMORE: These highlight of 12-year old LeBron James are spectacular\n\nFor two months, he waited for news, and just before the trade deadline, he was moved to the Raptors in a salary dump deal. Toronto waived Paul on Friday, and rather than look to latch on elsewhere, he has retired.\n\nIt's not quite the same as Willie Mays on the Mets or Michael Jordan on the Wizards, but it's the kind of lame ending that doesn't befit a legend.\n\nPaul will finish his NBA career averaging 16.8 points, 9.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game.\n\nHe's second in NBA history in career assists, with 12,552. He's also second in steals, at 2,728.\n\nIn both stats, only John Stockton had more.\n\nMORE: This is a mind-blowing Bronny James stat\n\nPaul was one of the holdouts as a true point guard as the NBA turned toward scoring guards leading them on the floor.\n\nHe could score in a variety of ways, too. It just wasn't his purpose.\n\nPaul set up his teammates, and he did it just about as well as anyone in NBA history.\n\nHis ending deserved a better setup than it got, that's for sure.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's legacy doesn't change despite messy trade rumors\n\n'Worst shooting form of all time' draws comparisons to Lonzo Ball, Shawn Marion\n\nThis NBA Dunk Contest field is one of the worst ever\n\nOne pass shows why Cavs traded for James Harden",

    "fullText": "Charlotte Bankes hoped to \"put on a better show\" as her Olympic hoodoo continued with a quarter-final exit from the snowboard cross - in another missed medal chance for Team GB.\n\nBankes, appearing at her fourth Games, is a former world champion and has 26 World Cup golds to her name, but an Olympic medal is the one that continues to evade her grasp.\n\nAlthough slower than anticipated in her seeding run, the 30-year-old had qualified fastest from her heat but looked off the pace from the start of her quarter-final, crossing the finish line last.\n\nIt was the same story four years ago in Beijing when Bankes exited at the same stage, a crash to blame on that occasion.\n\nAsked by BBC Sport how she was feeling, Bankes replied: \"Lost.\n\n\"I feel like I've done exactly the same as four years ago, which is very frustrating.\n\n\"We've worked incredibly hard to improve from that and I feel it hasn't made any difference today.\n\n\"I've been struggling with the track all week, but we thought we'd found solutions.\n\nBankes' preparations for these Games had not been ideal.\n\nIn April last year she broke her collarbone, an injury she needed further surgery - including a bone graft from her hip - on in the summer after it was found not to be healing correctly.\n\nBut she came into the Games back to full fitness and had won a gold medal at a World Cup in China just last month.\n\n\"It's a tough one to swallow. I was hoping to put on a better show, but it didn't work out today,\" she added.\n\n\"It can be a cruel sport. The team did all the work behind me and I didn't pull it off.\"\n\nAustralia's Josie Baff won gold, with Czech Eva Adamczykova taking silver and Italian home favourite and former champion Michela Moioli the bronze.\n\nBankes has just 48 hours to brush off her disappointment before she returns to the start gate alongside team-mate Huw Nightingale in the mixed team event.\n\nBankes and Nightingale were crowned world champions in 2023.\n\nThe Livigno Snow Park has not been a happy hunting ground so far for Team GB at the Milan-Cortina Games, and the wait goes on for a first Olympic gold or silver medal on snow.\n\nTwo fourth-place finishes for freestyle skier Kirsty Muir and snowboarder Mia Brookes came earlier in the week, but both will return to action in the coming days, as will Zoe Atkin, the current halfpipe world champion.\n\nTeam GB's Tabitha Stoecker narrowly missed out on the opportunity to occupy a podium place at the halfway point of the skeleton competition as compatriots Freya Tarbit and Amelia Coltman put in strong showings.\n\nStoecker was third after the first heat having clocked 57.40 seconds but a disappointing second run saw her drop down to fifth, 0.40secs outside the medals with an overall time of 1:55:01.\n\nThe 25-year-old had impressed in training this week with a series of first and second-fastest times but her 57.61secs in run two leaves her with an uphill battle to get back among the medal positions.\n\nStoecker, a former trapeze artist, became the first British woman to win an overall skeleton World Cup medal for more than a decade when she took bronze in January having recorded five top-six finishes including a European Championship silver.\n\nTarbit, eighth after heat one, produced a slick second run to move up to sixth with 1:55:16 while Coltman is ninth on 1:55:59.\n\nThe trio are making their Olympic debut and it is the first time three women have represented Team GB in the skeleton at a Winter Games.\n\nAustria's Janine Flock takes an overnight lead into Saturday's medal-deciding heats with an overall time of 1:54:48 while German duo Susanne Kreher and Jacqueline Pfeifer are second and third, respectively.\n\nAnother German, Hannah Neise - the reigning Olympic champion - sits between Stoecker and the medal positions.\n\nIn Tesero, Andrew Musgrave finished sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle to post Britain's best finish in a Winter Olympic cross-country skiing event.\n\nThe 35-year-old, appearing at his fifth Games, battled warm conditions to clock a time of 21 minutes 6.3 seconds as Norwegian star Johannes Hosflot Klaebo won his record-equalling eighth Olympic gold.\n\nGB team-mate Joe Davies was 12th, while James Clugnet was 34th.\n\nMusgrave, who relocated to Norway 17 years ago, had to pause his interview with BBC Sport to vomit but said: \"I was never going to be in the fight for a medal, but I probably should have got that fourth spot. But there isn't a massive difference to sixth, without a medal.\"\n\nTeam GB's men were left to rue a shocking first end as a stubborn fightback against hosts Italy in a throbbing Cortina Curling Stadium was not enough to prevent their first defeat of these Winter Olympics.\n\nAfter winning their opening two matches, including against the Swedish rink who beat them in the gold-medal match four years ago, the British team went into their second high-grade encounter in two days in a strong position.\n\nHowever, a horrendous first end - during which the Italians stole four points - left them chasing in front of a raucous home crowd armed with horns, bells and whistles.\n\nThese British players are the world's top-ranked rink for a reason though, and they slowly reeled in Italy, levelling in the ninth end.\n\nHowever, the local favourites held firm in the last to win 9-7 and add the scalp of GB to that of the Swedes, who they beat in their opener.\n\n\"We had to dig deep and we played nine really good ends and controlled it from there, but we just couldn't do enough to get the win,\" lead Hammy McMillan told BBC Sport.\n\nSeven wins from the nine round-robin matches will guarantee a place in the semi-finals - fewer may well still be sufficient - so Bruce Mouat's rink are still in a strong spot before facing the Czech Republic on Saturday (13:05 GMT).\n\nGB's women are not in such good shape, though.\n\nAfter mistakes cost them in their opener to China, another few moments of slackness undermined their attempts to beat South Korea on Friday.\n\nUltimately, the British rink fell to a 9-3 defeat and are now without a win in their opening two matches, with the daunting task of facing the three medal favourites - Canada, Sweden and Switzerland - in their next four games.\n\nThe Canadians are up first on Saturday at 08:05 GMT.",

This award is still very much up for grabs, though, with Andrei Vasilevskiy still close behind.\n\nHere are the latest NHL odds to win the top netminding honor.\n\nIlya Sorokin has seen his odds go from +160 to -125 over the past four weeks. Tampa Bay's Andrei Vasilevskiy has also been on the upswing, going from +790 to +120 during the same span and leapfrogging Logan Thompson and Scott Wedgewood on the odds board in the process.\n\nIlya Sorokin is the current betting favorite to win the 2026 Vezina Trophy due to his league-leading six shutouts and a dominant 2.44 GAA. Despite the Islanders ranking near the bottom in defensive zone time, Sorokin leads the NHL with over 24.8 Goals Saved Above Expected (GSAx), effectively stealing games against elite offenses.\n\nFollowing a historic January where he posted a .935 save percentage, Sorokin has cemented his case by carrying a heavy workload. His ability to maintain a .916 save percentage while facing high shot volumes makes him the undeniable frontrunner heading into the stretch run.\n\nPick: Ilya Sorokin (-125)\nStake: 2 units\n\nGet a first bet encore up to $800 with BET99 bonus code COVERSNHL.\n(not available in Ontario)\n\nMost sportsbooks will display odds in the American format as listed above. When the regular season is nearly finished and a consensus has emerged, you might see a player with a minus sign (-) ahead of his odds, like this:\n\nThe (-) means that Hellebuyck is the odds-on favorite, and a bettor would need to wager $400 to win $100. Other contenders in the Vezina race might have plus (+) odds to win.\n\nHere, a bettor stood to profit $650 for every $100 wagered.\n\nIf American odds aren't your thing, simply use a tool like our odds converter to switch the odds to decimal or fractional format.

    "title": "Why the Jaguars’ 2026 season won’t be like 2018",
    "description": "The present-day Jaguars are better equipped to sustain success than the Sacksonville or Pederson Era teams.",
    "fullText": "The Jacksonville Jaguars are the winners of the AFC South. They have a young quarterback and an opportunistic defense. After years of idling in the gutter, they soared to unfamiliar heights, resetting the biased image the nation holds of our beloved, gritty, horrifically beautiful Jags.\n\nWe’ve seen this story before — and the ending wasn’t pretty.\n\nJacksonville clinched the division, thus clenching the hearts of their fans, in 2017 and 2022 before flopping in “Same Old Jaguars” fashion the subsequent seasons.\n\nWhy will things be any different this time around?\n\nWell, for starters, the starting quarterback for the 2026 Jaguars (27-year-old Trevor Lawrence) is better than the primary passers for the 2023 and 2017 teams (24-year-old Lawrence and 25-year-old Blake Bortles, respectively). Lawrence was named an MVP finalist after his tear in the second half of the 2025 season. He’s come a long way from his 2023 season, which he finished on injured reserve. And I’m not going to waste everyone’s time by explaining why he’s better than Bortles.\n\nThe 2026 Jaguars should feel much more confident not just in their quarterback but also in their head coach, offensive playcaller, and defensive playcaller compared to 2018 and 2023.\n\nThose two teams failed in part because they were content with the coaching staff. To be fair, it’s asking a lot to make significant changes after making the playoffs. What’s more damning is that those two teams were content with the roster.\n\nThe Jaguars extended Bortles’ contract in 2018. Their two big moves that offseason were drafting DT Taven Bryan with the 29th overall pick and signing RG Andrew Norwell to a top-of-the-market deal. The Allen Bros (WRs Robinson and Hurns) left in free agency along with nickel CB Aaron Colvin, who was replaced by D.J. Hayden. The front office didn’t make any significant changes to maximize the sudden turnaround.\n\nSame goes in 2023. Trent Baalke spent three of his first four draft picks (TE Brenton Strange, RB Tank Bigsby, LB Ventrell Miller) on non-premium positions that already had an above-average starter in place. The big moves that offseason were placing the franchise tag on Evan Engram and replacing RT Jawaan Taylor with first-round pick Anton Harrison. There are certainly cap-related reasons to consider as well, but for a second time, the front office sat on its hands and assumed Jacksonville’s growth would be linear, or at least stay flat.\n\nInstead, the 2018 and 2023 Jaguars were bitten by the injury bug and regressed in several key categories.\n\nThe Sacksonville defense was obviously due for regression in turnover margin (they ended up falling from fifth-best in 2017 to third-worst in 2018), but they also worsened in sack margin (from second-best to fifth-worst). Tough look given the nickname. In fact, according to Sharp Football Analysis, their -18 differential in forced sacks from 2017 to 2018 was the largest year-to-year difference for any NFL team in 30 years.\n\nSacks were already an issue for the 2025 Jaguars, and we all just watched the Seahawks’ pass rush dominate Super Bowl LX. One would think that general manager James Gladstone and the current regime will bolster the defensive line aggressively this offseason. That may be the path to ensuring 2026 doesn’t end up like 2018 or 2023.\n\nI recorded a podcast with BCC alum John Shipley on this very subject if you’re interested in more rationale.\n\nAre you still nervous about history repeating itself, Jaguars fans?\n\nTell us why or why not in the comments!",

    "fullText": "On Thursday night, President Donald Trump announced that five former National Football League players with criminal records will receive pardons, including one late former Houston Oilers player.\n\nBefore he was drafted into the NFL, Billy Cannon was a standout tight end at Louisiana State University, where he won the coveted Heisman Trophy in 1959.\n\nCannon joined the Bud Adams-owned Houston Oilers under new head coach Lou Rymkus, the same calendar year he won the Heisman, shortly after a contract dispute with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThe All-Pro set a record in first season for all-purpose yards and helped the Oilers to an AFL Championship.\n\nHis later seasons with the team were marred by injuries and back problems, and he successfully requested a release from the team in 1964 before signing with the Oakland Raiders, then ending his NFL career with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nCannon continued on and eventually became a dentist after his career. According to a report from ESPN, Cannon later admitted to counterfeiting in the 1980s after a series of bad investments and debts left him penniless.\n\nHe served two years in a Texarkana prison. He later died in 2018 in Louisiana.\n\nOther players pardoned included Joe Klecko, Jamal Lewis, Travis Henry, and Nate Newton of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story you think we should cover?

    "description": "The final NFLPA survey isn't a good look for many teams, including a Super Bowl team in the Patriots.",
    "fullText": "Revisiting the 10 worst NFLPA team report card grades including Jets, Patriots, Browns and more originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLess than a week after Super Bowl 60, some major news came out for all 32 NFL teams. As ESPN's Adam Schefter shared, the NFL won a grievance against the NFLPA, which will put an end to the public team report cards.\n\nThese report cards would come out after every season, grading each team on the following categories: Treatment of families, Food/dining area, Nutritionist/dietician, Locker room, Training room, Training staff, Weight room, Strength coaches, Team travel, Head coach, and Ownership.\n\nIn the wake of the NFL's win to stop the release of these report cards from the NFLPA, last year's report cards are worth revisiting, and specifically, the worst graded teams from around the league. Among those teams are the New York Jets, Cleveland Browns, and, surprisingly, the New England Patriots, who made the Super Bowl this season.\n\nThe worst team in the NFLPA's final report card was the Arizona Cardinals. They were ranked 32nd out of 32 teams, with poor grades in nearly every category.\n\nThe Cardinals graded as the worst team in the league with their locker room, training room, and treatment of families. Their highest graded area, their head coach, was just fired after the 2025 season.\n\nThe NFLPA's report card graded the New England Patriots as the second-worst team in the NFL. For a team with such a storied history and immense success, this was a surprising grade for what's been one of the top teams in recent years.\n\nThe Patriots had the NFL's worst weight room and was second worst in team travel. They're building new facilities, so if these report cards hadn't stopped, things might've looked better a few years from now.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns come in as the third-worst graded team from last season's NFLPA team report card, with multiple categories falling in the bottom three around the league.\n\nThe Browns had the NFL's worst training staff and had one of the worst locker rooms, training rooms, and head coaches in the league. Kevin Stefanski was fired, so there is some change has already been made based on this grade from last year.\n\nThe New York Jets come in as the 4th-worst team by the NFLPA's team report cards. Owner Woody Johnson was a big reason this report card is now over, as he was a leading voice to get the NFLPA to stop releasing them to the public.\n\nThe Jets' most noteworthy grade was for their owner, Woody Johnson. It's fitting that the worst graded owner was one of the leading voices to get the report cards to stop.\n\nWhile that was their lone league-worst graded category, overall, their grades aren't great, with only the team's Nutritionist / Dietitian being in the top-half of the league.\n\nMore: Jets' Woody Johnson leading figure behind NFL's successful push to end NFLPA's team report cards\n\nComing in at 28th in the NFLPA report card are the Pittsburgh Steelers. They were ranked in the same spot the prior year, so not much changed for Pittsburgh players from one year to the next, which, with this grade, is not a good look.\n\nThe Steelers were graded as having the worst strength coaches in the league. While it's not their worst grade - a tie between ownership and the locker room, a D - the Steelers were graded as the worst in the NFL in one category.\n\nMike Tomlin was their lone A grade, and their highest-ranked category by far. But now, he's off the team, replaced by Mike McCarthy. If this report card were to be made in the future, the Steelers might drop a bit with the loss of Tomlin.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers were the 27th graded team in the final NFLPA survey before it was shut down. While not the worst in the league, it's the worst of the NFC South. But, they weren't the worst in any category.\n\nWhile the 27th overall grade isn't ideal for the Buccaneers, not having any graded metric in the bottom few spots is a decent spot to be in. Their worst grade was their ownership at a D+, while their strength coaches were a top-10 group at 6th overall.\n\nMore: Why Fernando Mendoza is lucky Browns are not picking 1st overall in 2026 NFL Draft\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, a Super Bowl champion team coming off their third straight appearance, were graded as the 26th-worst team in the league by the NFLPA report card.\n\nThe Chiefs had two categories as top-five in the NFL, with their head coach, Andy Reid, and their nutritionist/dietitian graded very highly.\n\nBut, with low grades in a lot of other categories, the Chiefs finished as the 26th-worst graded team in the NFLPA's last report card.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers were the NFLPA's 25th-worst team after the 2024 NFL season. While this isn't a good grade, they do have a few areas where they're graded fairly highly.\n\nWhile the Panthers finished with a top-10 in Treatment of Families, Nutritionist / Dietician, Training Staff, and Strength Coaches, the rest of these categories weighed them down.\n\nDavid Tepper is being graded as the second-worst owner is a big reason for the lower grade, as Carolina comes in as the 25th-worst graded organization from the final NFLPA report card.\n\nComing in at 24th overall, or the 9th-worst graded team, is the Cincinnati Bengals. They are one of the more interesting teams, with wild swings in grades across different categories, some being among the best, others the worst.\n\nThe Bengals grades are very interesting. While they're top-10 in four categories, they're also the worst in the league when it comes to the Treatment of Families, Food/Dining Area, and the team's Nutritionist/Dietician.\n\nAdd on a bottom-10 owner, and despite being strong in multiple areas, the Bengals final grade from the NFLPA's report card is among the worst in the NFL.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills are the final team in this list, ranking as the 10th-worst graded team in the NFLPA's most recent and final report card.\n\nThe Bills have the worst team travel in the NFL, despite having solid grades with their Treatment of Families and the Weight Room.\n\nTheir travel, and other bottom-10 graded categories, have the Bills coming in as the 23rd worst team, and the third AFC East team to be featured in the worst 10 graded teams from the NFLPA report card.\n\nAll of the most recent NFLPA report cards can be found here on the NFLPA's website, with more insight into the methodology for these grades and why each team graded the category the way they did.\n\nEvery other report card can be found there, which features the Miami Dolphins as the 1st-ranked team in the NFL from a year ago.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings were runners-up, with the rest of the league falling between those two teams and the 10 worst graded organizations outlined above.\n\nWho didn't vote for Robert Kraft?

    "description": "Two NFL draft analysts have some good news for the Jacksonville Jaguars.",
    "fullText": "Two of the best NFL draft analysts in the business, Daniel Jeremiah and Jordan Reid, have some good news for the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nAddressing cornerback and edge rusher are likely two items fairly high up on GM James Gladstone's offseason to-do list, and this year's draft class has a lot of talent at those positions.\n\nOn the edge rusher position, Jeremiah had this to say: \"If you need an edge rusher, this is a good draft to double up. The depth of the class is impressive. I've got 10 guys worthy of a spot in top 50 players. There's another layer of traitsy players beyond that group.\"\n\nThe Jaguars are positioned well here with Josh Hines-Allen and Travon Walker, but depth is a need. Beyond those two, the only other defensive ends under contract as of now are Danny Striggow and BJ Green.\n\nJacksonville could also use more steady pass-rush production from the rotational members of their defensive front.\n\nHere are the top 10 defensive ends in this year's draft from Mel Kiper's big board:\n\n1. Rueben Bain Jr., Miami (Fla.)2. Keldric Faulk, Auburn3. Zion Young, Missouri4. Akheem Mesidor, Miami (Fla.)5. Dani Dennis-Sutton, Penn State6. Caden Curry, Ohio State7. LT Overton, Alabama8. Jack Pyburn, LSU9. Max Llewellyn, Iowa10. Vincent Anthony Jr., Duke\n\nReid then had this to say about the cornerback and safety positions: \"This is a fantastic DB class. I have a huge cluster of 2nd and 3rd round grades at both safety and CB right now. The testing and on-field drills will be fun to watch at the Combine. Interested to see who separates from the group.\"\n\nAt cornerback, the Jaguars still have Jourdan Lewis, Jarrian Jones, and Travis Hunter, but Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome are free agents.\n\nThe level of need that Jacksonville has at this position will be dependent on what happens in free agency with Brown and Newsome, or whether an outside addition is made.\n\nSafety is less of a need, but perhaps is still a position that Gladstone could add to. Andrew Wingard is set to be a free agent, but on the roster are Eric Murray, Antonio Johnson, Caleb Ransaw, and Rayuan Lane.\n\nHere are Kiper's top cornerbacks in this year's draft:\n\n1. Jermod McCoy, Tennessee2. Mansoor Delane, LSU3. Avieon Terrell, Clemson4. Brandon Cisse, South Carolina5. Colton Hood, Tennessee6. D'Angelo Ponds, Indiana7. Chris Johnson, San Diego State8. Julian Neal, Arkansas9. Chandler Rivers, Duke10. Keionte Scott, Miami (Fla.)\n\nThe Jaguars do not have a first-round pick this year, but Jacksonville owns 11 picks in total, including four in the top 100. So the opportunity to address both edge rusher and cornerback with early-round picks does exist.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Lots of talent for Jaguars at 2 key positions of need",

    "fullText": "The Henry Snyder Tigers (NJ) girls basketball will be without their head coach for the rest of the season due to numerous infractions, according to a NJ.com report.\n\nTigers head coach Reggie Quinn has been suspended for the rest of the 2025-26 season as the result of events that took place in a Feb. 3 matchup with Hudson Catholic and then two days later not taking the court versus Bayonne.\n\n“There was a series of infractions that occurred with the Snyder girls basketball team,” Hudson County Interscholastic Athletic League president Jack Baker said via the report. “The HCIAL Controversies Committee met to review what had occurred last week. We consulted with the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) and it was deemed that the Snyder girls basketball team would not be entering the Hudson County Tournament this year.”\n\nQuinn explained to NJ.com that in the Feb. 3rd 57-47 loss to Hudson Catholic that the Tigers head coach was keeping his team off the court while trying to move spectators for his players’ safety, in which he acknowledged himself may have worsened the situation overall. Aftermath of the events was Henry Snyder players deciding on their own to not play a Feb. 5 tilt against Bayonne, which Quinn believes was a decision they made themselves.\n\nThe Tigers (11-7) two days later after not showing up for the Bayonne game, which the NJSIAA deemed a forfeit by Quinn’s team, Henry Snyder returned to action and pulled of a 54-21 rout of Union City on Feb. 7.\n\n“I was suspended, so I didn’t talk to anybody,” Quinn said via the report about his suspension. “I was at home and we go to play Bayonne and I get a call from my AD and he says the girls aren’t here. I’m like, ‘What do you mean?’ … The league blamed me for that also. Now my suspension went from two games to the rest of the year, which makes no sense. There’s no proof I had anything to do with that.”\n\nFor New Jersey high school girls basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the Garden State, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "fullText": "Ukrainian Vladyslav Heraskevych remain banned from 2026 Winter Olympics skeleton competition after his appeal was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday.\n\nThe slider was banned by ruling body IBSF based on International Olympic Committee (IOC) rules over a dispute concerning a helmet he wanted to wear in the event to honour athletes killed in the war with Russia.\n\nThe court said in a statement following an emergency ruling that the sole arbitrator appointed for this matter \"whilst fully sympathetic to Mr Heraskevyc's commemoration, is bound by rules in the IOC Athlete Expression Guidelines.\"\n\nThe arbitrator considers that these guidelines \"provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.\"\n\nHeraskevych had argued that \"the exclusion is disproportionate, unsupported by any technical or safety violation and causes irreparable sporting harm to him.\"\n\nThe CAS arbitrator said that she was sympathetic with Heraskevych's attempt to \"raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people.\"\n\nBut she added that the limitations imposed by the IOC to express views during competitions on the field of play are \"reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness (in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs).\"\n\nHeraskevych had already ruled out racing\n\nEarlier, Heraskevych appeared to have ruled out racing at the Olympics even if he won his appeal against the exclusion.\n\n\"It looks like this train has left,\" the 27-year-old, draped in the Ukrainan flag, told reporters after emerging from a two-and-a-half-hour hearing. \"I cannot do another race so it is done.\"\n\nHis CAS hearing began at a hotel in Milan on Friday and he said he was \"positive\" that his appeal would be upheld.\n\nThe court has set up an ad hoc division to deal with Olympic appeals quickly.\n\nThe first two runs of the Olympic skeleton competition in Cortina took place without Heraskevych, despite him finishing among the top six in all five training runs. The medal runs are scheduled for later on Friday.\n\nA reinstatement would be complicated and the athlete said racing in a symbolic one run was unlikely given the sport is dangerous.\n\n\"From a competitive perspective this makes no sense,\" he said, as he slammed the IOC's \"mockery\" for removing his Games accreditation and then giving it him back despite his racing ban.\n\nHeraskevych had refused repeated warnings from the IOC to give up wearing his helmet.\n\nThe IOC does not allow any kind of political statements in competition. He says this is different as it is a commemoration and not political, something he believes other athletes have been allowed to do.\n\nBut IOC president Kirsty Coventry told a news conference: \"The rules are the rules and I believe in the rules.\n\n\"We have to allow for athletes to express themselves but also to keep athletes safe.\"\n\nShe said political messaging is permitted away from actual competition, in press conferences for example, but that athletes themselves had agreed that the actual events should be neutral.\n\n\"I think he in some ways understood (the rules), but was very committed to his beliefs, but sadly it doesn't change the rules,\" Coventry said.\n\nHeraskevych was excluded shortly before the start of the first run in Cortina d'Ampezzo on Thursday.\n\nIn his appeal, he requested the annulment of the decision and \"that CAS reinstates him in the 2026 [Olympic Winter Games] with immediate effect, or in the alternative, that the athlete performs a CAS supervised official run pending the final decision.\"\n\nAround 40 members of the European Parliament have backed the slider and have written to the IOC, calling the ban wrong.\n\nPress reaction in Europe has also been largely against the IOC, while some Russian media in contrast have said the body has been too soft in giving his accreditation back.\n\nRussia as a nation is not allowed at the Games because of the war, but some individual Russian athletes are competing as neutrals after proving they have not actively supported the conflict.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers appear poised to begin the 2026 season with a six-man rotation, manager Dave Roberts said Friday.\n\nSpeaking at spring training in Glendale, Arizona, Roberts confirmed that the team expects to utilize a six-man rotation, as they did last year.\n\n“I think early, it’s hard to say it won’t be,” Roberts said, as reported by Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register. “How beholden we are to that, for how long, I don’t know.”\n\nLast year, the Dodgers rotated Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Shohei Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow, Emmet Sheehan and Clayton Kershaw.\n\nGeneral manager Brandon Gomes said after the season that the team was open to another year of the six-man rotation, and five of those pitchers are back with the team in 2026.\n\nPresumably, they’ll hold their spots, but who will fill in for the retired Clayton Kershaw?\n\nGomes previously said Roki Sasaki “absolutely” will be starting again after spending much of 2025 hurt or in the bullpen, where he found more success than he’d had as a starter.\n\nHow he bounces back after a roller coaster season has led to him being considered perhaps the team’s biggest mystery of the season.\n\nWhile it’s easy to assume Sasaki will take Kershaw’s spot in an otherwise unchanged rotation, Roberts wouldn’t confirm the starters.\n\n“It’s hard to say right now who those participants are. It really is,” he said. “But I do think that with the starting pitching depth we have, it makes sense as I sit here right now.”\n\nAs Roberts implied, only time will tell. Injuries, trades, performance and many other factors will come into play, and change could come swiftly.\n\n“How that looks, end of April? I’m not sure yet,” he said.",

    "description": "Braves GM Alex Anthopoulos spoke with the media once again and as you can imagine, it was pretty wide-ranging.",
    "fullText": "With spring training officially rocking and rolling, this is definitely as good of a time as any to hear from both Atlanta Braves President of Baseball Operations/General Manager Alex Anthopoulos and the newly-promoted manager, Walt Weiss. Both of them spoke with the media one-after-the-other on Friday afternoon and the first thing on my mind was to confirm how AA felt about the state of the rotation.\n\n“We’ve got four guys right now in Strider, Sale, Holmes and López in our rotation We’ll have competition for our fifth spot,” confirmed AA when I asked him about the rotation. “We know what Strider can be, we know what Sale has done. López was an All-Star the year before and Holmes did a nice job for us in the rotation before he went down. We like some of the arms we have and some of the talent we have.”\n\nHe went on to add that he feels like the team as a whole can step up in order to make sure that the burden of bringing this team back to success is equally spread amongst the squad. “I think the big key for our club is that offensively for the past two years we haven’t performed the way we hope,” said Anthopoulos. “Part of that is performance, part of that is injury. We have a deeper group of position players, a deeper bullpen and that should take a lot of pressure off of the other parts of the team.”\n\nAnthopoulos was also asked about Ha-Seong Kim during the press conference and we got a tiny bit of good news on that front. “We’re hopeful and optimistic that he’ll be back at the beginning of May,” revealed AA. That bit of information is new, as that appears to be on the shorter side of recovery from Kim’s icy calamity.\n\n“That’s why we have guys like Mauricio Dubon. He can play everywhere and we’re excited to see him at shortstop where he’ll have an opportunity, ”Anthopoulos affirmed shortly afterwards. “If we didn’t sign Kim then we were prepared to go with Dubon at shortstop. Hopefully it’s not that long of an absence for him and he’ll have the remainder of the season to have a chance to have a lot of at-bats and make a big impact on our team.”\n\nAA also shared his reasoning behind the signing of catcher Jonah Heim, as he confirmed that he’ll be getting an opportunity to serve as the backup backstop around here. “He had a tremendous 2023 as starting catcher on a World Series team. He was a Gold Glove, it was great. The last two years offensively, he hasn’t performed nearly as well and the numbers certainly bear that out. Even defensively, he hasn’t been the same,” stated AA.\n\n“He’s still young — he’s only 30. He’s got a switch-hit bat with a lot of upside and Walt Weiss talked about during his interview about how he wants to get Drake Baldwin’s bat in the lineup as often as he can with the DH spot. Having someone who’s been durable as an everyday guy, I’m not going to put it on him to be the guy he was in 2023 but he’s young enough, he’s capable and he’s done it before. We think he can do better offensively and defensively as well.”\n\nWe also got a bit of an update on Sean Murphy’s status as well, which was basically just confirming that they’re expecting to have him back in May as well before evaluating their options at the catcher spot. “We think Sean Murphy will be probably be back sometime in May but we start at the end of March so that’s a long period of time,” said AA. “Having a guy like Jonah who’s been a starter and we think he has upside, it was a no-brainer for us. He knows when Sean Murphy comes back that we’ll see where we’re at with the roster but we’re excited to have him. We think he’s certainly capable of being a better player than he’s been and that’s certainly the goal and we think our staff might be able to unlock some things.”\n\nWith two players already heading to the 60-Day IL in the form of Spencer Schwellenbach and Joe Jiménez, AA also had to talk about the injury situation as well. He did acknowledge the issues with injuries but also made sure to bring up everybody’s track record in that regard.\n\n“We’ve been a healthy club, we had a bunch of durable players. Some guys had pre-existing things, especially some of the guys that pitched,” said Anthopoulos. “We knew that there was some risk with some of those guys. [When it comes to] position players, guys getting hit in the hands, sliding into a base, I don’t know that you can really address those things.” He went on to say that the Braves were looking into “their throwing programs, their bullpens. We’ve looked at if a guy has had a recurring injury on the position player side. It’s obviously an issue across the game and we had a really good run of success with the same group of coaches and trainers and all the medical staff — a long run of success that led to six divisions and seven postseasons in a row. We had injuries but not like we had the last few years. Like anything, you should review and tweak and make adjustments and we’re certainly going to try to do that as well.”\n\nI also asked Alex Anthopoulos about how he envisions new outfielder Mike Yastrzemski fitting in with the current Braves squad. As you can tell, he’s pretty excited about having Yaz in that clubhouse at the moment. “Right now with Sean Murphy being out, the thought is that Jurickson Profar will get the majority of DH at-bats against right-handers. Mike Yastrzemski would start in left field against right-handers. Against left-handers, Walt Weiss will move some things around.”\n\nAA went on to talk more about how he’s looking forward to seeing Yaz get deployed heading into the new season. “Knowing Yastrzemski is the strong side of a platoon facing the right-handed starter should get a lot of playing time. We also like the fact that he can cover us at all three outfield spots. We don’t view him as an everyday center fielder but he can certainly fit in there short-term and we just like the upside,” stated AA. “We thought he got back to some of the really good things he had done with his swing when he went to the Royals so we like that. We think there’s offensive upside as well as a left-handed bat and the fact that he protects us at so many positions. He’s just a great fit.”\n\nOverall, AA seems pretty optimistic about the state of the club — though to be fair, everybody’s excited about the state of their club at this time of year. With that being said, there is actual reason to be optimistic about things surrounding the Braves heading into the new season and we’ll have to see how things play out going forward. We’ll have more information from Walt Weiss in the near future so keep an eye out for that. For now, what do you think abut AA’s comments here on Friday?",

    "fullText": "Dricus du Plessis is preparing to launch his comeback tour.\n\nThe former UFC middleweight champion is hoping to land a spot in the upcoming UFC 327 lineup on April 11 at Kaseya Center in Miami. It would mark the first appearance for “Stillknocks” since coughing up his crown by way of unanimous blanket at UFC 319 last summer in Chicago.\n\nHis first choice would be a five-round rematch against Khamzat Chimaev.\n\n“We need to fix some things, obviously, and I spent time now doing that,” Du Plessis told Fight Forecast. “But like I said, I’ll be ready for April. I would love to be on that April card, the Miami card. There’s no opponent yet, but I’m ready to go again and get my belt back. I’d of course love it to be Khamzat and redeem that loss but for me right now, the next fight is the most important fight of my life.”\n\nReturning in April would both meet and exceed this 16-week deadline.\n\n“Fighting Khamzat again is of course what I’m after, am I expecting any surprises, no,” Du Plessis added. “There’s not going to be any surprises, that’s the way he’s gonna fight and if he tries anything different it will be a terrible night (for him). He did what he had to do to win the belt, and we can’t hate on him for that. Now it’s my responsibility to go and fix that, to stop him from doing that again and getting him to fight my fight.”\n\nDu Plessis will have to hope the promotion doesn’t want Khamzat for UFC White House.\n\nUFC 327 does not yet have a main event, though several bouts have already been announced. That includes the light heavyweight showdown between Dominick Reyes and Johnny Walker, as well as the 205-pound matchup pitting Paulo Costa against Azamat Murzakanov.\n\nWith UFC 327 less than two months away, you can expect a decision on this sooner, rather than later.",

    "fullText": "Was today’s trade a precursor to another one coming soon?\n\nToday the Astros traded OF Jesus Sanchez to the Toronto Blue Jays for a former Astros fan favorite – OF Joey Loperfido.\n\nClearly the Astros were sour on Sanchez after he performed poorly both at the plate (.199 AVG with Houston) and in the field, as this deal essentially equates to a salary dump. Sanchez was due to ear $6.8M while Loperfido still makes the MLB minimum $820K. Loperfido also has an option remaining.\n\nWith the trade, the Astros now sit close to $15.8M under the first tax line ($244M), and have more flexibility for another deal to bring in a player who would be a lineup upgrade. While a previous fan favorite, Loperfido profiles as a reserve OF capable of playing all three outfield spots.\n\nWhat does this trade mean going forward?\n\nRight now it means the Astros have a projected starting outfield of Zach Cole in LF, Jake Meyers in CF and Cam Smith in RF. But it’s important to note, that is as of right now.\n\n\"We're not done.\"\n\nDana Brown #Astros GM just moments ago after announcing Joey Loperfido acquisition from Toronto for Jesús Sánchez @KHOU pic.twitter.com/nLce4qgNsE\n\n— Jason Bristol (@JBristolKHOU) February 13, 2026\n\nAstros GM Dana Brown dropped the bomb at the end of his conversation with the media. “We’re not done.”\n\nNow armed with more flexibility under the first tax line, perhaps Brown can now be more aggressive in his pursuit of another left-handed OF bat, possibly one that can play LF every day and set up a RF platoon of Cam Smith and Zach Cole, or lead to a trade of Jake Meyers and a shift of Cole or Smith to CF?\n\nMeyers has been the topic of trade discussion all off-season, as has 3B Isaac Paredes who has been caught in a logjam in the infield with 1B Christian Walker. While the club likes Paredes bat and toughness, Paredes has far more value on the market than Walker does due to his age, contract, production and positional flexibility. Reports have indicated significant interest in Paredes and near none in Walker.\n\nIn addition to a left-handed hitting power bat in the outfield, the Astros could also benefit from a backup catcher to replace Victor Caratini and another high-leverage arm in the bullpen due to uncertainty surrounding closer Josh Hader and reliever Bennett Sousa. Hader had a setback in his recovery from a sprained shoulder capsule as he developed bicep tendonitis, and Sousa’s season was cut short due to a flexor/pronator strain in his left elbow.\n\nSousa also had Thoracic Outlet surgery in 2024 but returned to pitch the best baseball of his career. Thoracic Outlet surgery usually leaves pitchers with diminished stuff, but Sousa was surprisingly at his best.\n\nThere isn’t much in the way of a viable backup catcher on the free agent market that would offer an offensive upgrade from Cesar Salazar, so it seems the best way to achieve that would be the trade market. The Astros have been linked to Pirates catcher Joey Bart.\n\nWhile the Astros didn’t get their final roster truly settled before Spring Training began, it is clear that they are still working on that potential final roster. They’re not done yet.",

    "description": "Could FC Bayern bring in the Manchester City star?",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich center-back Kim Min-jae is rumored to be open to a transfer this summer (depending on what you want to believe, other reports refute that he wants an exit), which could open up a roster slot for the Bavarians.\n\nAssuming Dayot Upamecano eventually signs his new contract (the team thinks it will happen soon), there could be a need for a capable third member in the center-back group to team up with Upamecano and Jonathan Tah.\n\nCould that player be Manchester City’s John Stones — an English national team colleague of Harry Kane and former teammate of Bayern Munich head coach Vincent Kompany?\n\nIt could be the end of an era at Manchester City this summer as I’m now hearing of major doubts about one of their long-serving star players alongside the ongoing speculation surrounding Pep Guardiola.\n\nAccording to my sources, as first reported here for the Daily Briefing, it looks increasingly like John Stones will not be offered a new contract, with his current deal at the Etihad Stadium due to expire at the end of this season.\n\nThere seems to be an acceptance that it’s time for both City and Stones to part ways, and some suitors may already have established early contacts to sound out the player. The 31-year-old is technically already free to talk to clubs from abroad, and numerous sources have named potential destinations for him in Europe.\n\nOne name coming up a lot is Bayern Munich, who are keen to explore cheap options to strengthen their depth in defence.\n\n“Bayern have already started moves behind the scenes to persuade Stones,” one source said. “His old teammate Vincent Kompany could be key, as could another England player in Harry Kane, but a final decision won’t happen now.”\n\nIf Kim departs (which could be a big if), there would be a void. While an intriguing prospect, Cassiano Kiala is not considered to be ready for that kind of role just yet, so the Bavarians might have to hit the open market. Stones, as an experienced free transfer could be an intriguing add.\n\nStones currently makes a total financial package (salary + bonus) of €18.6 million per Capology and would likely have to take a pay cut to join Bayern Munich.\n\nFC Nürnberg has extended the contract of former Bayern Munich and German national team star Miroslav Klose, who is the squad’s head coach:\n\n🚨🏁 Now official: Miroslav Klose has extended his contract as head coach of 1. FC Nürnberg. 🇩🇪 https://t.co/R5xGDi17sW pic.twitter.com/jurVmLX8L7\n\n— Florian Plettenberg (@Plettigoal) February 12, 2026\n\nFC Nürnberg is in 10th place of the Bundesliga table with seven wins, five draws, and nine losses. Klose coached at Bayern Munich from 2018 to 2021. He served as the head coach for the U-17 youth team from 2018 to 2020, before moving up to become an assistant coach under Hansi Flick for the 2020/21 season. Klose left Bayern Munich in May 2021 during the mass exodus by the coaching staff.\n\nReal Madrid wants to make a move for Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Vitinha, but would settle for AZ Alkmaar’s Kees Smit.\n\nSmit has been linked to many clubs, including Bayern Munich:\n\nReal Madrid are making plans for next season and see PSG’s Vitinha as their top target, with AZ Alkmaar’s Kees Smit as a backup plan, according to AS. Madrid are looking to finetune their squad as they look to mount a double assault on La Liga and the Champions League, and Vitinha is seen as a player with vital leadership qualities. The 27-year-old is contracted until 2029 and appears happy in the French capital, which could make Madrid’s interest complicated. Smit, 19, would be easier to facilitate, but he is not yet the finished article. Madrid are already planning to build on the return of Endrick and Nico Paz from their respective loan spells.\n\nLiverpool is reportedly keeping an eye on AC Milan star Christian Pulisic, whose deal expires in 2027:\n\nLiverpool are monitoring Christian #Pulisic. His contract expires in 2027 (4M + 1M as bonuses), even if #ACMilan have unilateral option to extend until 2028. Pulisic is happy at #Milan, but was expecting a contract extension never offered by Milan until now. #transfers #LFC\n\nIf former Bayern Munich striker and current FC Barcelona star Robert Lewandowski leaves the club this summer, he will have no shortage of options.\n\nChicago Fire, AC Milan, Atlético Madrid, Fenerbahce and the Saudi Pro League are all interested in the Polish Hitman:\n\nBarcelona striker Robert Lewandowski has serious offers from Chicago Fire, AC Milan, Atlético Madrid, Fenerbahce and the Saudi Pro League ahead of his contract expiring in the summer, reports Mundo Deportivo. The 37-year-old is calm about his future and will not make a decision until April, and he will review the Blaugrana’s offer plus those from elsewhere. Lewandowski will prioritise Barcelona depending on the offer he receives, but he is focused on stability and family happiness over the finances of a deal.\n\nIt must be nice to be Mo Salah. The Liverpool star could be on the verge of tripling his salary:\n\nLiverpool striker Mohamed Salah could triple his salary to £1.2 million-per-week if he moves to Al Nassr as Cristiano Ronaldo’s replacement in the summer, according to the Mirror. The 33-year-old will be the new face of the Saudi Pro League if it can convince him to leave Liverpool after nine years at the club. The SPL are keen to replace Cristiano Ronaldo, who is threatening to walk away from his deal at Al Nassr in the face of what he sees as favoritism in the transfer market toward Al Hilal. The Portugal legend is on the cusp of scoring 1000 goals but could return to Europe to achieve the feat. He has been linked with an emotional return to Sporting Lisbon.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!",

    "description": "The Steph vs Sabrina 3-point contest drove engagement but hasn’t been repeated since.",
    "fullText": "NBA and WNBA All-Star events have been going through a bit of a revamp in recent years. With increasing sponsorships, NBA salaries, and a decline in fan attention span, the NBA All-Star Game in particular has flopped in viewership and overall cultural resonance. It’s hard to get players to compete at 100% when they are afraid of being injured, and when there is little incentive to do so. Especially when it comes to events like the 3-point shooting contest, skills contest, or whatever other event the NBA tries to think up to change things up. WNBA players can be motivated by $25,000 prizes, of course, given their salaries are lower than those of NBA players, but NBA players are too well-compensated to really care about that kind of stuff anymore.\n\nA few years ago, the NBA made a huge step in re-engaging fans in All-Star events by holding a shooting contest between Stephen Curry and Sabrina Ionescu in 2024. While some “battle of the sexes” type events can quickly devolve into questionable territory, ripe for sexist online takes and poor analysis, this event was actually quite well done. Ionescu and Curry are two of the best shooters in the sport’s history, and also great friends, so there was a mutual respect that ran through the lead-up to the event and the event itself.\n\nSince it was a standard 3-point shooting contest, it wasn’t like Ionescu was at a huge disadvantage for being a woman. She was able to shoot from the WNBA three-point line (22 feet, 1.75 inches from the basket) if she wanted, but opted to use the standard NBA three-point line (23 feet, 9 inches from the basket) instead — a distance she is more than comfortable making shots from.\n\nAll of the prize money from this contest was being donated to charity, with Ionescu and Curry each pledging donations to their own personal foundations. The event was also in reaction to Sabrina Ionescu breaking the all-time 3-point contest record, NBA or WNBA, at the previous year’s WNBA All-Star Game. At the time, fans wondered how Ionescu would fare against the NBA’s best shooters — this event gave those fans what they wanted.\n\nThe event was a massive success, achieving the highest NBA All-Star Saturday viewership numbers in over five years, with over 5 million viewers. It outperformed the main event of the weekend, the actual All-Star Game, and viewership peaked during that event in particular. While Ionescu lost to Curry 29-26, her 26 points matched the actual winner of that year’s NBA 3-point shooting contest, and while she definitely didn’t need to gain any respect from the NBA contingent, she did.\n\nAfterward, many people expressed genuine interest and excitement in repeating the event. At the time, Caitlin Clark was still in college, but fans were frothing at the mouth at the idea of seeing her compete in a 3-point contest. There were ideas of Steph and Sabrina going up against Clark and another NBA shooting star like Damian Lillard. Yet, years later, none of that has come to fruition.\n\nIn fact, Ionescu or Clark have not competed in a 3-point contest since.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, Ionescu bowed out of the WNBA All-Star 3-point contest to focus more on the upcoming Paris Olympics the week after — super fair. That same year, Clark declined an invitation to the contest as well, saying she wanted to rest after playing for over a year of consecutive basketball.\n\nWhen it came to the following NBA All-Star game, in 2025, Clark declined an invitation from the NBA to participate. According to reporting from The Athletic, Clark wanted her first WNBA All-Star 3-point shooting contest to be in the WNBA.\n\nThe 2025 WNBA All-Star game was held in Clark’s WNBA home of Indianapolis, Indiana, where she plays with the Indiana Fever. A perfect spot to make her first appearance in the event, but those hopes were dashed as Clark suffered numerous injuries in the summer of 2025, leading to her missing most of the season and the All-Star game.\n\nNow, as we head into the 2026 NBA All-Star game, the hype of Steph vs Sabrina is two years old, and with nothing to replace it. Fans would surely show up in the same fashion for a Caitlin Clark-led 3-point contest, which would definitely help the NBA’s floundering All-Star Weekend viewership numbers. Yet, nothing of the sort has materialized in the nearly two years since Clark came onto the scene, and this year was likely impossible as the NBA battles with WNBA players over their next CBA.\n\nStill, it’s pretty wild that the NBA found a solid way to drive engagement, bring in the WNBA fanbase, and provide some tangible excitement for the All-Star events… and just hasn’t repeated it since. Add it to the list of self-inflicted L’s in the Adam Silver era.",

    "description": "Penn State’s final giant hurdle in the regular season is here",
    "fullText": "Coming off a bye week, No. 5 Penn State men’s hockey faces its final major test of the regular season when they take on No. 2 Michigan in Ann Arbor for a two-game series this weekend. The Nittany Lions and Wolverines are fighting to keep pace with conference leader Michigan State as the season dwindles down. Both of these teams are locks to make the NCAA Tournament.\n\nWho: Michigan Wolverines\nNPI Ranking (PSU): 2 (5)\nWhen: Friday, February 13 and Saturday, February 14\nWhere: Yost Ice Arena, Ann Arbor, MI\nTimes: 6:30pm (Friday), 5pm (Saturday)\nTV: Big Ten Plus (Friday), Big Ten Network (Saturday)\nRadio: Penn State Sports Network\n\nMatt DiMarsico-Reese Laubach-JJ Wiebusch\nGavin McKenna-Dane Dowiak-Aiden Fink\nLev Katzin-Ben Schoen-Luke Misa\nShea Van Olm-Nic Chin-DeGraves-Casey Aman\n\nJackson Smith-Jarod Crespo\nCade Christenson-Mac Gadowsky\nCarter Schade-Nolan Collins\n\nMichigan has been a wagon this season, boasting a record of 23-5 and 14-4 in Big Ten play. The Wolverines’ seven-game winning streak came to an end with a 5-2 loss to Michigan State in Detroit on Saturday, but they did beat the Spartans in overtime the night before at home.\n\nWhen the Wolverines’ offense gets rolling, they are very difficult to slow down. Their 4.7 goals per game is the best mark in the NCAA. Will Horcoff leads the Big Ten with 20 goals, and he scored one goal in each of the first two games against Penn State this season. TJ Hughes (13 goals, 27 assists) leads the Big Ten in total points, and Michael Hage (12 goals, 25 assists) is second. Ten different Michigan players have at least eight goals this season, giving this offense nearly four complete scoring lines. Michigan gets 34.7 shots on goal per game, 5th in the NCAA. A vulnerable Penn State defense will have its hands full.\n\nJack Ivankovic (.925 save percentage, 2.02 GAA) was a bit rusty in his return to the lineup, giving up four goals in the loss to Michigan State, but he is still one of the best goaltenders in the country this season. Stephen Peck (.911 save percentage, 2.61 GAA) seamlessly replaced Ivankovic for six games. Like Penn State, Michigan has two goaltenders capable of performing against high-quality teams. Michigan only gives up 27.6 shots on goal per game, 20th in the NCAA. The Wolverines play a fast-paced, wide open game like Penn State, but they also have a very talented blue line capable of closing off passing and shooting lanes.\n\nMichigan has the No. 3 power play (29.8%) and No. 39 penalty kill (79.1%) in the NCAA. The Wolverines are somewhat of a half-team on special teams. Penn State’s penalty kill has been excellent, but Michigan will eventually make them pay if the Lions take too many penalties.\n\nGavin McKenna will play this weekend.\n\nAlex Servagno will miss the rest of the season with an injury. Casey Aman will most likely take his place as the 12th forward. Penn State’s forward depth will be tested in the final weeks.\n\nMichigan leads the all-time series 32-21-1.\n\nPenn State has won three of the last four meetings at Yost Ice Arena, including a sweep in last year’s Big Ten Tournament.\n\nMichigan is 5-0 in overtime games this season.\n\nThis series will come down to which Penn State team walks in the door. The two meetings at Pegula Ice Arena earlier in the season were the best and worst efforts Penn State has displayed this season. Penn State is unlikely to win a track meet-style game. Michigan has a wide talent advantage, and the Nittany Lions do not even have 12 healthy forwards.\n\nThe Wolverines are 22-1 when scoring more than two goals and 1-5 when scoring two goals or fewer. Penn State will need to repeat the formula from the 4-2 win over Michigan back in November. Disciplined forechecking and backchecking, production from the bottom six, and good goaltending are the keys to solving this Michigan team. The Wolverines have split all of their series against Top 10 teams this season, and I think Penn State’s goaltending is good enough to keep that trend alive.",

He will join a large ownership group that includes former NFL running back Marshawn Lynch, Golden State Warriors guard Gary Payton II, Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd and musician Billie Joe Armstrong, lead singer of Green Day, which performed before Super Bowl 60 last Sunday.\n\n“Bringing my business acumen and sports fandom together as part of the Oakland Roots and Soul ownership group is truly special,” E-40 said in a statement. “This move is about investing in a sport that connects the world. I look forward to working closely with the ownership team to continue to amplify the fan experience while delivering successful results on the field.”\n\nE-40 will perform at the Oakland Roots season opener against New Mexico United on March 14 in the USL Championship. The Soul plays in the USL W League.\n\nHe’s often seen at sporting events in the Bay Area. E-40 has been spotted courtside at Golden State Warriors games, and he is a vocal San Francisco 49ers supporter. He created the song “Niner Gang,” which derives from the popular saying for their fans, “Bang, bang, Niner Gang.” When the San Francisco Giants were making World Series runs in the early 2010s, E-40 attended home games and traveled to road games to support. He was also the featured performer when the Cal Golden Bears football team held “Bay Appreciation Day” in 2024.\n\nE-40, a Vallejo, Calif., native, was honored by the city in October 2023. The city had a one-mile stretch of Magazine Street renamed “E-40 Way.”\n\nWith the Warriors back in San Francisco, the Raiders now in Las Vegas and the Oakland A’s now playing in West Sacramento, the soccer clubs have emerged as a source of pride and new alternatives for pro sports in Oakland. They’ve also been a leader in celebrating town culture and community.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSan Francisco Giants, Soccer, Women's Soccer, Culture\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "After Team USA ice dancing duo Madison Chock and Evan Bates finished in second place in ice dance at the 2026 Winter Olympics, people are questioning this year’s judging.\n\nChock and Bates, who were favorites for gold, took home the silver medal. French ice dancers Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron won gold, finishing just more than one point ahead of Team USA.\n\nA recent Change.org petition calling for “transparency and accountability in Olympic judging” has nearly 15,000 signatures while Chock, 33, herself also expressed that she’d like to see the playing field remain fair going forward.\n\nWhen Chock and Bates, 36, were asked by CBS News if they’d like to see any changes in the way that ice dance is judged in the future, Chock said, “I think it would definitely be helpful if it’s more understandable for the viewers to just see more transparent judging and understanding [in] what’s really going on.”\n\n“I think it’s also important for the skaters that the judges be vetted and reviewed to make sure that they are also putting out their best performance because there’s a lot on the line for the skaters when they’re out there giving it their all,” she continued. “We deserve to have the judges also giving us their all and for it to be a fair and even playing field.”\n\nIn recent days, French judge Jezabel Dabouis came under fire for favoring Beaudry, 33, and Cizeron, 31, by nearly eight points. According to the Associated Press, if her score was removed, Chock and Bates would have won gold.\n\nThe International Skating Union stands by the judge, saying in a statement, “It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations. The ISU has full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.”\n\nStill, Chock and Bates admit to feeling disappointment coming in second place — but remain proud of their performance on the ice.\n\n“I think there were a lot of emotions flooding through us yesterday. I think there was some disappointment for sure,” Chock said in an interview with People, published on Friday, February 13, as she appeared to get choked up.\n\n“It’s been a long journey, but I certainly have a lot of pride for what we have accomplished, and who we’ve become on the way to those accomplishments,” she added. “So in general, [we’re feeling] gratitude.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump Has Not Disciplined Staffer Allegedly Responsible for Racist Obamas Video\n\nVictoria Justice Shows Off Her Travel Style While Spending Time in Thailand\n\n‘Dance Moms’ Alum Abby Lee Miller Sashays Into Vacation Mode During Sunny Island Escape\n\nThis story Olympic Silver Medalist Madison Chock Calls for ‘Transparent Judging’ as Skating Scores Are Questioned first appeared on Globe.",

    "fullText": "It’s been 14 months since Patrick Sandoval signed a two-year, $18.25 million contract with the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThe 29-year-old southpaw is still waiting to make his Red Sox debut after undergoing Tommy John surgery and missing the entire 2025 season but took a big step toward his return on Friday.\n\n“Patrick Sandoval just faced five hitters. Struck three of them out. Hit 94. Threw 15 pitches or so,” Peter Abraham of The Boston Globe posted on Bluesky. “Sandoval said today was a milestone in his return. Felt like part of a team again after rehabbing last year.”\n\nSandoval suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament midway through his final season with the Los Angeles Angels in 2024 before signing with Boston that December.\n\nHis best season came in 2022, when he went 6-9 with a 2.91 ERA, 1.33 WHIP and 151 strikeouts across 148 2/3 innings pitched covering 27 starts.\n\nAfter going 7-13 with a 4.11 ERA and 1.51 WHIP in a career-high 28 starts in 2023, Sandoval was limited to 16 starts in 2024 before going down with his injury.\n\n“The Red Sox’ Patrick Sandoval faced batters today for the first time since Tommy John surgery,” The Boston Globe’s Tim Healey posted on Bluesky. “He is competing for the No. 5 spot in the rotation. Regarding a potential move to the bullpen, he said he’ll ‘do whatever they want me to do.'”\n\nThe front four of the Red Sox’s starting rotation appears to be set with reigning AL Cy Young runner-up Garrett Crochet scheduled to pitch Opening Day, followed likely by new acquisitions Ranger Suarez and Sonny Gray. Right-hander Brayan Bello is presumably going to be Boston’s No. 4 starter.\n\nSandoval could be competing with the likes of Johan Oviedo, Connelly Early, Payton Tolle and others for the fifth spot in the rotation.\n\nRed Sox Sign 6-Foot-7 Pitcher To Minor League Deal After Velocity Climb",

    "description": "Porsche's impressive start to the 2025-26 season continues as Pascal Wehrlein wins in Jeddah",
    "fullText": "Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has moved into the lead of the Formula E standings with a dominant drive in the first race of the Jeddah E-Prix.\n\nAlthough Wehrlein was already in a strong position in the first-third of the race, it was ultimately the timing of his Pit Boost Stop and his impressive speed in Attack Mode that ultimately decided the race in his favour.\n\nThe German driver pulled out a lead of 7.5s before he ran out of the 600kW mode, allowing him to cruise to the chequered flag and score a comfortable win in Saudi Arabia. Polesitter Edoardo Mortara (Mahindra) and Mitch Evans (Jaguar) rounded out the podium spots.\n\nThere was drama on the starting grid when Nyck de Vries struggled to engage drive in his Mahindra and had to be wheeled back to the pitlane.\n\nWhen the race eventually got under way, de Vries’ team-mate Mortara suffered a major tyre lock-up, allowing fellow front-row-starter Maximilian Guenther to grab the lead into Turn 1.\n\nNissan’s Norman Nato slotted into second ahead of the other DS Penske of Taylor Barnard, with Wehrlein  and a recovering Mortara completing the top five.\n\nThe virtual safety car was deployed before there was further shuffling at the front, as Pepe Marti pushed Zane Maloney into the wall at Turn 7, leaving the Lola Yamaha Abt stranded on track.\n\nGuenther perfected the restart when the race resumed on lap 4, but Nato managed to find a way past the DS Penske driver two tours later to put Nissan at the front for the first time in the race.\n\nFurther back, Wehrlein was on the move in the factory Porsche, passing Barnard at the restart before snatching second from Guenther on lap 14.\n\nOn the next lap, Nato willingly moved out of Wehrlein’s way, but it was Guenther who was in the lead - courtesy of an early Attack Mode - when the field headed into the pitlane for their mandatory Pit Boost recharge.\n\nAmong the leading group, Wehrlein was the first to head into the pits on lap 18, with the likes of Guenther, Nato and Mortara following him a lap later.\n\nGuenther initially held on to the lead after the pitstop phase, but Wehrlein had no trouble passing his countryman, using the Attack Mode to blast past him on lap 20.\n\nThereafter, the Porsche driver pulled away from the rest of the field, building a lead of over seven seconds with 10 laps to run.\n\nThat meant when Mortara was on the move after arming his Attack Mode late in the race, Wehrlein had a comfortable buffer at the front of the field.\n\nAlthough the German had to aggressively save energy to make it to the finish line, he was still able to take the chequered flag with a comfortable margin of 2.6s, securing Porsche’s first win in Formula E since the 2025 Miami E-Prix.\n\nMortara crossed the finish line in second to put Mahindra back on the podium, while Evans leapt from 12th on the grid to finish a solid third for Jaguar.\n\nNico Mueller rounded out a strong day for Porsche in fourth, while Jaguar’s Antonio Felix da Costa and Citroen star Nick Cassidy took advantage of late Attack Modes to finish fifth and sixth respectively.\n\nSebastien Buemi put Envision in seventh ahead of Jean-Eric Vergne (Citroen), while Jake Dennis (Andretti) and Barnard (Andretti) completed the top 10.\n\nGuenther’s decision to take the Attack Mode prior to his Pit Boost stop backfired, leaving him outside the points in 11th.\n\nDan Ticktum (Cupra Kiro) and Nato also dropped down the order late in the race, while reigning Formula E champion Oliver Rowland endured a disastrous race en route to 17th.\n\nFormula E chief sends \"naughty” Jeddah invite to Max Verstappen after F1 2026 criticism\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

Russian missile simply took Karyna from us one day earlier,\" he said.\n\nEleven-year-old Diachenko was a promising gymnast who died in the south-eastern city of Mariupol in March 2022, according to the memorial website Angels of Sport.\n\nShe had been inside her home with her family when a Russian air strike hit the building, killing her and her father instantly. Her mother and brother were taken to hospital, which was later hit by an air strike, killing them too.\n\nHalinichev died in 2023 in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian news outlet Tribuna, he refused to participate in a 2022 European boxing championship in order to volunteer as a soldier.\n\nSpeaking to Voice of America, one of his coaches said once Halinichiev had seen the destruction caused by the war, he felt he had to fight.\n\n\"I have a little child. I don't want her to live in occupation among the aggressor, among the Russians,\" another of his coaches quoted him as saying.\n\nTribuna said Halinichev was injured twice during the war but continued to fight until his death.\n\nHe won silver at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games and the 2021 European U22 Championships.\n\nIshchenko from Kyiv was a four-time strongman champion and former Ukrainian powerlifting champion.\n\nHe was also a coach, mentoring young people.\n\nUkrainian outlet Sport.ua said following his death: \"His legacy continues to inspire new generations of athletes who see in him a model of resilience, courage, and dedication to sport and the country.\"\n\nHe died last year on the front lines.\n\nNine-year-old Ivashko was a judo enthusiast who was killed while trying to shelter from Russian air strikes alongside her mother in Kyiv in June 2023.\n\nFollowing her death, the Ukrainian Judo Federation's president Mykhailo Koshlyak said Ivashko's death was \"painful for the entire Ukrainian judo family\".\n\nKhabarov, 31, was a \"stalwart\" of the Ukrainian national shooting sport for over a decade, according to the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF).\n\nDuring his career he was a national record holder on multiple occasions, as well as a national champion.\n\nIn 2023 he joined the army and died in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine last year.\n\n\"He was an elite athlete who paused his career to defend his country, and will forever be in the hearts and memories of the Ukrainian people,\" ISSF president Luciano Rossi said in a statement following his death.\n\nKononenko was a competitive strongman as well as an actor who starred in popular Ukrainian TV programmes.\n\nHe went to fight on the front lines in February 2022 and by November had suffered a severe injury, Pravda reported.\n\nHe designed his own rehabilitation programme, which he shared with others on social media, before later going back to fight on the front, becoming a senior lieutenant and commander of a rifle platoon.\n\nContact with him was lost during a combat mission in February last year and he has since been considered missing in action. A funeral was held for him in December.\n\nKozubenko was a diver and coach from Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine.\n\nHe died in combat last year aged 31.\n\n\"In the country's most difficult time, Kozubenko took up arms to defend his native land,\" the Ukrainian Sports Comittee said when announcing his death.\n\nKurdel was a 20-year-old dancer who died in the central city of Kryvyi Rih in July 2022 during a Russian air attack.\n\nShe had been training at a sports ground with her father at the time of the attack. Her parents were also injured but survived.\n\nKurdel won a number of international dance competitions before her death.\n\nKutsenko was a track cycling champion who had competed for Ukraine between 2006 and 2016, representing his country at European and World championships.\n\nThe 34-year-old lived in Italy with his family prior to the full-scale invasion, but came back to Ukraine to join the army not long afterwards.\n\nHe was killed in 2024 in a combat mission, according to regional officials.\n\nFifteen-year-old Lebid was killed during a Russian missile strike on a high-rise building in Dnipro in 2023.\n\nShe was a ballroom dancer and president of her school's student council.\n\nAccording to Angels of Sport, during her school presidential election campaign she wrote about herself: \"I'd like to tell you a little about myself: I'm 15 years old, I have a music education, and I'm passionate about learning English.

He'll become an unrestricted free agent on March 11.\n\nIt's an open question what kind of contract the 30-year-old Samuel can command in free agency.

    "fullText": "Jorge Martin has stirred up the MotoGP rumour mill even more by sharing his predictions for the 2027 grid, including a nod to Yamaha, the team he’s been heavily linked with.\n\nJust before testing got underway, reports surfaced that Martin was closing in on a move to Yamaha. This came not long after similar talk around Fabio Quartararo potentially heading to Honda.\n\nWhile nothing has been officially confirmed yet, announcements are expected before the season kicks off in Thailand.\n\nThat hasn’t slowed down the speculation. It seems most riders want their plans set before the 22-race season gets underway in early March.\n\nMartin is the latest rider to offer his take on what the 2027 grid could look like, following up on Marc Marquez’s predictions from earlier in the week.\n\nHe placed himself at Yamaha, saying it was “just because of the rumours!”\n\nMotoGP fans didn’t waste time sharing their opinions online. Under an Instagram video of Martin’s comments, one fan joked, “Puts himself in Yamaha for the ‘rumours’ like he hasn’t already signed the contract.”\n\nAnother picked up on who else he put alongside him at Yamaha, writing, “So Martin and Bagnaia at Yamaha factory next year? Hmmm…”\n\nThe changes would line up with other predictions already out there. Martin forecasted that Bastianini would move from Red Bull KTM to Repsol Honda alongside Quartararo. Meanwhile, Pedro Acosta would replace Bastianini at KTM after spending three years with GasGas Tech3.\n\nNot everyone sees his prediction as just a bit of fun. Unlike Marquez’s light-hearted comments last year about Juan Pablo Montoya and Conor McGregor joining forces at VR46 Racing Team, many believe Martin is serious about his picks.\n\nThe majority feel he might actually be on to something this time around. One fan said simply, “First one to speak facts,” while another added, “The rumours are all accurate!” Someone else posted: “First truthful prediction video for the 2027 season.”\n\nWith Pedro Acosta expected to join Borgo Panigale after the upcoming season, questions have lingered about what lies ahead for Bagnaia.\n\nThe two-time world champion has been linked with nearly every manufacturer on the grid, but reports suggest he is leaning toward Yamaha.\n\nMany MotoGP fans aren’t convinced this is the right move. They feel that other teams might offer him a better path forward than Yamaha.\n\nAprilia, in particular, has been highlighted as a strong alternative. The team has made significant strides over the past year and now looks capable of challenging for race wins.\n\nMotoGP fans think Francesco Bagnaia may be making the wrong team choice for 2027\n\nWhy rivals say Marc Marquez is untouchable\n\nFrancesco Bagnaia downplays Ducati world titles, admits to being self-critical",

Our thoughts and prayers are with Carter’s family, we cannot imagine the depth of their loss, and we are holding them close in our hearts.”\n\nJohnson was a freshman from South Dakota, according to the outlet.\n\nThe crash, which also injured the other 32 passengers aboard the team’s bus, happened on Highway 4 near Twin Lakes just after 11:00 a.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 11, the Iowa State Patrol (ISP) confirmed in a press release.\n\nCiting police, KCRG reported that the team’s 74-year-old bus driver veered off the road and crashed when he overcorrected while trying to get back in the lane, rolling the bus over into a ditch along the highway. Two of the passengers were reportedly ejected from the bus and trapped under the bus when it came to a stop. A van carrying other student-athletes that was traveling behind the team’s bus stopped, and the classmates attempted to perform CPR on Johnson, who died at the scene, according to the outlet.\n\nAt the time of the deadly crash, the baseball team was on their way to play North Arkansas College in Harrison, Ark., the Northark Pioneers confirmed in a Facebook post.\n\n\"Our hearts are heavy as we grieve alongside the Iowa Lakes College community,” Dr. Rick Massengale, North Arkansas College president, said in a statement. “The loss of a life is a tragedy that reaches far beyond one campus.”",

    "fullText": "The start of 2026 has dealt a harsh blow to the plans of the Spanish National Team. What began as a concern over the congested calendar has turned into a \"cascade of mishaps\" affecting vital pieces of the national setup. In response, Luis de la Fuente has activated a contingency plan: a preliminary list of 50 players (two per position) to ensure that the final 26 selected arrive fully protected against any unforeseen events.\n\nThe coaching staff is closely monitoring the progress of four key players. Mikel Merino, recently operated on his foot, is an absolute priority; doctors are confident that the scorer of the epic goal against Germany will be ready in time. Meanwhile, Marc Cucurella is dealing with hamstring issues, a critical area for his explosive style of play, while Nico Williams is struggling with a pubalgia that will delay his surgery until after the World Cup. The objective is clear: recover the \"main actors\" before turning to replacements.\n\nThe coach’s strategy rewards versatility. Players like Marc Pubill and Eric García are gaining ground thanks to their ability to play both in central defense and at right-back, where Álex Jiménez stands out after his breakthrough in the Premier League. In goal, although the Simón-Raya-Remiro trio seems unmovable, names like Joan García and Robert Sánchez remain in reserve.\n\nDespite the absences of Gavi and the recent injury to Pedri, the midfield remains Spain’s engine with Zubimendi and Fabián leading the way. Up front, following the serious injury to Samu Omorodion, the responsibility for scoring will fall to Mikel Oyarzabal and Ferran Torres. Nevertheless, the extended list keeps veterans like Morata and recovered players like Marco Asensio in contention, ensuring that Spain travels to North America with a fully reliable \"Plan B\".\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Last night brought a test of epic proportions for Northwestern, as it was tasked with taking down No. 1 Texas Tech in its first game of its long weekend in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nThe start seemed promising for NU, but reality struck early, and the hope for an upset slowly faded as the ‘Cats posted zero after zero in the bottom half of each inning.\n\nThat reality check was the nation’s best returning arm in NiJaree Canady, who pitched five innings of relief for the win, only giving up two hits while striking out eight.\n\nAs for the Red Raiders, it took them an inning to figure out Northwestern starter Emma Blea, crossing the plate twice in the second and never looking back. The two that crossed the plate were the only two earned runs for NU pitchers.\n\nIt was smooth sailing for Blea in the top of the first, as she retired .500 hitter Mihyia Davis on a lineout to center before painting the outside corner to log a backwards K at the expense of Mia Williams.\n\nFirst strikeout of the day for Emma Blea, and we are off at the @ClearwaterInv! 🔥\n\nT1 | NU 0, Texas Tech 0 pic.twitter.com/tEduUMGjTj\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nTaylor Pannell reached on an infield single on the very next pitch before Blea retired the side, doing her own dirty work by scooping up a Jackie Lis grounder.\n\nNorthwestern’s first at-bat was nearly a copy-paste of Texas Tech’s: a K, a popout, a single and a flyout all in succession.\n\nA leadoff walk surrendered to Alana Johnson came back to sting Blea and the ‘Cats later in the second. Lauren Allred laced a one-out double into the right-center gap, scoring Johnson to break the ice. Lagi Quiroga followed with one of her own, this one to the opposite gap, as the Red Raiders swiftly snatched an early 2-0 lead.\n\nNU seemed to kickstart some momentum of its own after Blea got back into her groove to end the inning. Kansas Robinson found herself on base after an error from Red Raiders’ starter Samantha Lincoln. Tru Medina then stood in the box to get plunked by a pitch, and after a Bridget Donahey flyout and an Izzy Cunnea sac fly, Kate Renschen drew a walk to load the bases.\n\nTexas Tech head coach Gerry Glasco then emerged from the dugout to bring out Canady, who cleaned up the mess in two pitches to halt the second-inning rally.\n\nBlea continued to settle back down and sent the ’Cats back to the dish after a 1-2-3 inning in the third, highlighted by a smooth play from Medina.\n\nWe see you, Tru Medina! 👀👏\n\nThe rookie making plays in the hot corner!#SCTop10 pic.twitter.com/GOVeIwi886\n\n— Northwestern Softball (@NUSBcats) February 12, 2026\n\nThe heart of the Northwestern order seemed to have Canady scouted, but luck wasn’t on its side in the frame. Kelsey Nader grounded out after a nine-pitch at-bat, Kaylie Avvisato ripped a line drive only to have it gloved by Pannell and Robinson went down on strikes after working a full count.\n\nBad omens continued to haunt Northwestern as it took the field for the fourth. An error by Donahey at short gave way to another double by Allred, setting up two runners in scoring position for Texas Tech. Quiroga’s sac fly did the job to drive in the run, padding the lead once more.\n\nThe ‘Cats seemed to have spiraled themselves out of the contest, as Canady shoved in the next half-frame, striking out Medina and Dohaney before getting a measly pop-up out of Cunnea to finish the fourth still unscathed.\n\nSigne Dohse’s first full inning of relief went quite smoothly, as she bounced back from an early base hit and induced soft contact to get out of the frame. Canady took note and did the same, also getting in and out of the circle after facing four batters.\n\nMedina’s throwing error to start the sixth opened the door of opportunity for Texas Tech, and it walked straight through. Allred got hit by a pitch to advance Logan Halleman, Hailey Toney laid down a bunt to move both runners and Davis came through to bring them both home on Texas Tech’s fourth two-bagger of the night.\n\nThat would be all for the Red Raiders’ scoring, but that was all Canady needed. She sat down five of the next six batters she faced before Chloe Riassetto’s number was called for the final out and the save.\n\nQuite the jarring welcome from the Panhandle for the ‘Cats to process, but there’s no rest for the weary. After Northwestern’s loss to UCF on Friday morning, NU rounds out the trip with contests against Missouri, No. 17 Georgia and No. 8 Texas A&M.",

    "fullText": "LSU DB's worst landing spot is with local Saints due to scheme reasons originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints are finally beginning to turn the corner in many different ways. Tyler Shough has given them an answer at quarterback, Chris Olave broke out in a big way, and the core of the team is finally taking shape.\n\nAt 8th overall, the Saints will have a chance to add an instant-impact starter for 2026 and beyond. While the focus will be on offense, at wide receiver and running back, the Saints could use an outside cornerback as well.\n\nIf they go for a cornerback, taking LSU DB Mansoor Delane, the local prospect, would be a fun addition. But, according to Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report, the Saints would be Delane's worst landing spot. Why? This would be a bad match schematically.\n\n\"The New Orleans Saints might not be that team,\" Knox writes. \"The Saints utilized zone coverage just under 78 percent of the time this past season, according to Sharp Football Analysis, while running pure man coverage less than 16 percent of the time.\"\n\nWith Delane's strengths being as a man coverage cornerback, the Saints taking him 8th overall would be putting him in a situation where his best strength won't be on display much.\n\nIf the Saints were running man coverage half the time, then the Saints would be a much more suitable landing spot for Delane.\n\nMore: Saints predicted to draft Alvin Kamara's replacement in first round with Notre Dame RB\n\nBut the local NFL Draft prospect, who's one of, if not the top, cornerbacks in this year's draft class, is not a viable option for the Saints in the first round.\n\nHis scheme fit makes him an unlikely selection, as the Saints would be better off taking a different player who's a better match for their defense later in the draft.\n\nTaking local talent in the NFL Draft is always a fun storyline, but this year, the Saints, in Knox's opinion, would be a bad landing spot for the LSU cornerback who's set to go very early in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nIs Taysom Hill retiring? Saints' fan favorite age, contract raise question\n\nSaints urged by NFL analyst to land a playmaker for Tyler Shough this offseason\n\nSaints get good news on pair of ascending offensive coaches after Steelers interviews\n\nWhy Saints being picked to play in Paris, France was a perfect choice by NFL\n\nSaints urged to sign 21-TD weapon in free agency for Tyler Shough\n\nTop WR prospect shares NFL Draft wish for Saints' Tyler Shough, Bills' Josh Allen",

She said that she is scheduled for a fourth surgery on her leg Saturday and could possibly return home to the U.S. where she will require another procedure.\n\nA little update from me…❤️ thank you for all the love and support. Helps me so much🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/ui0lfSS064\n\n— lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 13, 2026\n\n\"It's been quite a hard few days in the hospital here,\" Vonn said. \"I'm finally feeling more like myself, but I have a long, long way to go. [Saturday], I'll have another surgery and hopefully that goes well and then I can potentially leave and go back home, at which point I'll need another surgery. [I] still don't know exactly what that entails yet until I get some better imaging. But, it's kind of where I am right now.\"\n\nVonn injured her leg in a crash 13 seconds into her run at the alpine downhill competition. The injury required Vonn to be airlifted off the mountain and is expected to be career-ending for three-time Olympic medalist.\n\nIn a previous update Vonn said that she'd sustained a complex fracture of her tibia. Per Yale Medicine, a complex fracture is \"when the bone breaks into bits and pieces, when the soft tissue surrounding the bone is severely damaged, or when the patient has other illnesses or injuries that complicate treatment and healing.\"\n\nVonn skied on a torn ACL in the same left leg that she'd sustained just days before the start of the Olympics on Jan. 30. Her decision to ski on her injured leg drew scrutiny and speculation that it contributed to her crash.\n\nVonn's right arm got caught in a gate at the top of her run, sending her flying through the air at a high rate of speed and crashing into the ground.\n\nShe previously wrote that her ACL tear had nothing to do with her crash.\n\n\"I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash,\" Vonn wrote. \"My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever.\"\n\nAs she's been in hospital, the performance of American athletes at the Olympics has lifted Vonn's spirits. After thanking fans for their support in her recovery, she shouted out Team USA for their success in Milan Cortina.\n\n\"Good job, team, and keep crushing it,\" Vonn said.",

    "description": "On the right track to start",
    "fullText": "The first week of the season has Georgia Tech Softball off to a promising start. Already with a 5-2 record under their belts, the team looks ahead to their upcoming weekend in Gainesville, Florida for the Florida Classic, where they will play University of Florida (7-0; 0-0 SEC), Florida International University (FIU) (6-0; 0-0 C-USA), and Marshall University (4-3; 0-0 SBC) throughout the weekend.\n\nThe first matchup of the season was a home series last week versus Villanova as part of the Buzz Classic. The Jackets took home the win in both the Thursday and Friday games 8-0. Thursday’s game was pitched by sophomore Madalyn Johnson and Friday’s by sophomore Tymber Harris.\n\nUnfortunately, that was immediately met with a series of losses against #16 Alabama, where the Crimson Tide took the Friday and Saturday games from the Jackets, resulting in the two losses on the record. Alabama won 9-0 and 7-2 during those games.\n\nTech  ended the weekend with two wins versus East Carolina University (ECU) 13-6 and 6-2 in their Sunday doubleheader. The Jackets used five different pitchers between the two games with  Johnson seeing both games for a total of seven innings pitched against ECU.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Jackets took on the Kennesaw State Owls, adding to their slew of wins with a 10-2, 6-inning victory. Senior Kenley Hilleary started the game against her former school, pitching over half of the game before sophomore Sydnie Watts finished the game to secure the 10-2 win for the Jackets. Senior outfielder Paige Vukadinovich and sophomore outfielder Alyssa Willer shared the most runs scored for the team at three each, with senior infielder Jayden Gailey, freshman outfielder Abby McKinnis, freshman infielder and utility player Madi Duffel, and senior catcher Reese Hunter scoring one each as well.\n\nThis weekend, the team takes on the Florida Classic in Gainesville to face FIU at 1:00pm and Florida at 6:00pm Friday, FIU at 9:00am and Marshall at 11:30am on Saturday, and Florida at 11:30am on Sunday.",

    "fullText": "An AI clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting has caused concern among industry figures\n\nA leading Hollywood figure has warned “it’s likely over for us”, after watching a widely disseminated AI-generated clip featuring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting.\n\nRhett Reese, co-writer of Deadpool & Wolverine, Zombieland and Now You See Me: Now You Don’t was reacting to a 15-second video showing Cruise and Pitt trading punches on a rubble-strewn bridge, posted by Irish film-maker Ruairí Robinson, director of 2013 sci-fi horror The Last Days on Mars. Reposting the clip on social media, Reese wrote: “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”\n\nHe added: “In next to no time, one person is going to be able to sit at a computer and create a movie indistinguishable from what Hollywood now releases. True, if that person is no good, it will suck. But if that person possesses Christopher Nolan’s talent and taste (and someone like that will rapidly come along), it will be tremendous.”\n\nRobinson said that the clip resulted from a “2 line prompt in Seedance 2”, referring to the AI video generator Seedance 2.0, released on Thursday by TikTok co-owners ByteDance.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association (MPA), the Hollywood trade association, accused ByteDance of “unauthorised use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”.\n\nAI systems such as chatbots, image generators and video-making tools are trained on data taken from the open web, including copyright-protected material such as novels, art and film clips. This has led to artists and creative industries demanding compensation for the use of their material and the establishment of licensing frameworks to enable legal use of their content. Amid lawsuits related to those disputes, some creative companies such as Disney are signing deals with AI firms including OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nCalling on ByteDance to “cease its infringing activity”, MPA chair and CEO Charles Rivkin said: “By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.”\n\nBeeban Kidron, a crossbench peer in the UK and a prominent campaigner against relaxing copyright law, said AI companies must strike deals with the creative industries.\n\nKidron, who has also worked in Hollywood as a film director, said: “This is just the latest in a long stream of copyright abuses, but honestly from my conversations with both sides I believe there is a will between AI companies and the creative sector to make a deal. It seems to me that the AI sector needs to come to the table with a “real offer” that satisfies the creative industries. Otherwise we will have a decade of litigation and the destruction of an industry on which they depend.”\n\nByteDance has been contacted for comment.",

    "fullText": "From handheld to corded, self-emptying to stick models, these are our resident cleaner’s favourite vacuums for a spotless home\n\nThe best cordless vacuum cleaners, tested\n\n How to make your vacuum cleaner last longer\n\nBuying a vacuum cleaner isn’t as easy as you might think. With so many brands and models to choose from, it can be bewildering. Sticking with established brands isn’t necessarily a safe bet, with past performance being no guarantee that the latest models will be as good. Meanwhile, prices can be deceptive, with some affordable models now closing the gap on top-of-the-range brands when it comes to cleaning performance.\n\nYou can’t know all this by browsing through a department store or online. The ideal thing to do would be to take a few models home to try them out – but good luck persuading anyone to let you do that. Thankfully, you won’t have to try because I’ve tested an array of models for you. I’ve measured each one’s ability to perform a range of real-world cleaning jobs, so you can discover the best vacuum cleaner for you.\n\nBest corded vacuum cleaner overall:\nShark Detect XL Car + Pet LA791UKT\n\nBest cordless vacuum cleaner overall:\n\n Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty IP3251UKT\n\nBest budget corded vacuum cleaner: \n\n Numatic Henry Home\n\nBest cordless vacuum cleaner for pet hair:\n\n Vax HomePro Pet-Design\n\nBest vacuum for deep cleaning: \n\n Dyson Gen5detect\n\nThis isn’t the first time I’ve tested vacuum cleaners – over the past few years, I’ve reviewed them for various publications, which has given me a solid understanding of what makes a model good or bad. I’ve kept hold of a few of my favourite models for long-term testing, so I can easily make direct comparisons against those that are new on the block.\n\nMy house is also perfectly set up for vacuuming challenges. It has a mix of carpet and hard floor, a ready supply of hair (pet from my own dog and a box of clippings I procured from a local groomer; human from the hairbrush and carpet surrounding the dressing tables of long-haired family members), and plenty of dusty flour and chunky cat litter for testing purposes.\n\nBefore I started any cleaning, I used a suction meter to test the suction power of every vacuum, usually by sealing it with tape over the closest suitable opening to the collection bin. I also tested the batteries of cordless vacuums, where I timed how long it took for the battery to run down on the most and least powerful settings.\n\nThen it was on to the nitty-gritty. I carefully weighed out quantities of flour, cat litter and pet hair, depositing it on carpet and hard floor to test each vacuum. I weighed each model’s collection bin before I started, then passed the vacuum over each type of mess using the standard floor head or most appropriate alternative. Each vacuum was passed over the spillage once, using a single forward and pull-back motion. Then, by weighing the collection bin again, I was able to establish how much of the dirt had been picked up.\n\nAfter the test, models were either returned to the appropriate manufacturers, or – in the instance they didn’t want them back – donated to the British Heart Foundation.\n\nIf you want a vacuum that won’t run out of juice mid-clean, then the Shark LA791UKT is the best corded upright I’ve tested. It’s a modern-looking device with a sophisticated dual-roller floor head, a decent bin capacity of 2.5l, and no unnecessary features.\n\nWhy we love it\nWhen it came to cleaning tests, this Shark literally cleaned up. Flour and pet hair disappeared into its collection bin, with no trace left behind. Admittedly, it didn’t pick up all the cat litter we put down on a single backward and forward pass, but unleashing the handle from the main unit lets you easily target larger chunks – and it finished the clean-up perfectly.\n\nIt comes with a useful selection of accessories for tackling upholstery and getting into nooks and crannies. Conveniently, you can lift the collection bin away from the floor head to help gain access to harder-to-reach areas, too.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s expensive for a corded vacuum – the Henry Home is significantly cheaper.\n\nType: corded upright\nIncluded attachments: anti hair wrap pet tool, combination duster, crevice tool\nWeight (measured): 5.2kg\nSuction power (measured): 17kPa\nNoise: 80dB\nSize: 31 x 43 x 116cm (WDH)\nDust capacity: 2.5l\nCord length: 8m\n\nThe Henry’s design has stood the test of time, finding favour with home users and professional cleaners since its introduction in the early 1980s. Not much has changed on the basic model, but I tested the Henry Home, exclusive to the Henry website, which comes with more floor accessories than are usually offered by other retailers.\n\nWhy we love it\nAt the time of writing, the £189.99 Henry Home was only about £20 more than the standard Henry, available from the likes of Currys and Argos. That’s a good deal considering the extra equipment. For my carpet tests, I tried the AiroBrush, which is a brush roller that uses an internal air turbine to convert its own suction into the mechanical power needed to rotate the roller. It didn’t actually cope with pet hair or cat litter that well, becoming clogged by the former. Switching over to a simple funnel gathered the remainder. However, for vacuuming lighter everyday dirt on carpeted areas, the AiroBrush coped just fine.\n\nThe hard floor tool (basically a wide funnel with a stiff brush) did a cracking job on my hard floors, although I did find that it’s best held at an angle to ease the passage of larger particles and hair clumps.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the AiroBrush doesn’t have an anti-tangle mechanism; hair quickly became wrapped around its roller.\n\nType: corded barrel\nIncluded attachments: crevice tool, dusting tool, upholstery/mattress tool, AiroBrush, hard floor tool, multi-angle tool, flexi crevice tool\nWeight (measured): 7.1kg\nSuction power (measured): 18.5kPa\nNoise: 72dB\nSize: 32 x 34 x 35cm (WDH, cylinder unit only)\nDust capacity: 6l\nCord length: 10m\n\nCordless stick vacuums can be expensive, but they don’t have to be. The Vax HomePro Pet-Design isn’t the cheapest model out there, but it’s great value for money, combining decent cleaning skills with some handy features, including two attachments for pet hair.\n\nWhy we love it\nAs you can see from my before-and-after picture below, the Vax did a brilliant job of collecting flour, cat litter and pet hair from carpet, and it was almost as good on hard floor, with only a few pieces of cat litter escaping its clutches – easy enough to gather on a subsequent pass.\n\nIt has two power settings, regular and boost, and lasted for 34 minutes in my battery rundown test on its standard setting. That makes it easy to operate, and I particularly like the way it can support itself when standing up, so you don’t have to find somewhere to prop it up when you need a break.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t come with a soft roller specifically for cleaning delicate hard floors.\n\nType: cordless stick\nIncluded attachments: crevice tool, stair tool, pet hair remover, motorised pet tool\nWeight (measured): 3.5kg\nSuction power (measured): 19kPa\nNoise: 86dB\nSize: 22 x 25 x 116cm (WDH)\nDust capacity: 0.7l\nBattery life (measured): 34mins\n\nDyson’s latest cordless vacuum cleaner, the V16 Piston Animal, didn’t impress me enough to make it on to this list, but it has had a positive knock-on effect on the price of my favourite Dyson, the Gen5detect. Although launched at an eye-watering £850, the current price of this brilliant vacuum is down to a slightly lower £749.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike the V16, the Gen5 comes with two floor heads: the Digital Motorbar for carpet, and the Fluffy Optic for hard floor. Although you have to swap them over when you transition between surfaces, the benefit is that each one is an expert at its job. There’s also a handy dusting brush and crevice tool – built into the extension wand, so it’s always available – and what’s arguably the best motorised upholstery tool in the business.\n\nIn tests, this vacuum performs so well that I tend to use it to tidy up after testing, if other vacuums have fallen short.\n\nIt’s a shame that … swapping floor heads is an annoyance that Shark users don’t have to experience.\n\nType: cordless stick\nIncluded attachments: built-in dusting and crevice tool, combination tool, hair screw tool\nWeight (measured): 3.5kg\nSuction power (measured): 31kPa\nNoise: 70dB\nSize: 25 x 28 x 128cm (WDH)\nDust capacity: 0.77l\nBattery life (measured): 56mins\n\nBest for: a robot vacuum that converts into a cordless\n\nThose wanting to dabble in automated cleaning without losing the convenience of a corded stick need look no further than the Eufy E20. It’s essentially a robot vacuum (and a rather good one, too), but unusually, you can lift the suction mechanism out of the robot’s body, and use it as a handheld cordless. Attach the extension wand and floor head, and it’s a fully functional cordless stick.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … while the robot element is brilliant and the floor head performed well on carpet, it wasn’t quite as good as some of the dedicated cordless sticks on hard floor.\n\nType: robot/cordless stick; included attachments: 2-in-1 combination tool, crevice tool; weight (measured): 2.4kg; suction power (measured): 28kPa; noise: 78dB; size: 25 x 22 x 130cm (WDH, in cordless stick mode); dust capacity: 3l (self-emptying base); battery life (measured): 48mins\n\nThe Dyson Car+Boat is essentially a reboxed Dyson V8, although it drops the extension wand and two floor heads that come with the full model. That meant I couldn’t test it in quite the same way, since there’s no floor head to gather the mess. Instead, I got on my hands and knees and used the handheld attachments, which did a superb job of clearing up spillages.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s worth checking prices on V8 models before you buy. At the time of writing, the V8 Absolute – with additional wand, two floor heads, a better upholstery tool and two more attachments – was available from Dyson for the same price.\n\nType: handheld; included attachments: crevice tool, combination tool, mini motorhead; weight (measured): 1.9kg; suction power (measured): 21kPa; noise: 78dB; size: 13 x 33 x 21cm (WDH); dust capacity: 0.54l; battery life (measured): 38mins\n\nThose looking for the self-emptying skills of the Shark IP3251UKT but with a more reasonable price should consider the Tower VL220 Cyclone. It’s a pared-back alternative in terms of features, but keeps the core concept of a base station with a secondary vacuum function that sucks the dirt out of the cordless stick’s collection bin and into a larger receptacle below. As with the Shark, the base station also serves as a charging dock, although this model uses bags to gather the dirt. That makes for a less messy emptying, but bags cost £9.99 each, only hold 2l at a time and need to be ordered through Tower’s customer service because they aren’t available on the website.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it only comes with a fluffy roller floor head, so it isn’t great on carpet, plus the replacement bags are too expensive and a faff to buy.\n\nType: self-emptying cordless stick; included attachments: 2-in-1 crevice brush and nozzle tool; weight (measured): 2.6kg; suction power (measured): 28kPa; noise: 73dB; size: 35 x 24 x 131cm (WDH); dust capacity: 2l (self-emptying base); battery life (measured): 43mins\n\nIn most of my cleaning tests, the Henry Quick Pro performed well. Its floor head isn’t the best at collecting cat litter from a hard floor, pushing it ahead instead of sucking it up, but it leapt up the handheld funnel attachments when I used those instead.\n\nThis Henry uses bags to collect the dirt, which eject neatly into the bin when they’re full. They also act as the filter, so there’s less general maintenance required, since they’re regularly replaced rather than needing cleaning.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the disposable bags have a plastic component to them, which isn’t ideal considering they’ll end up in landfill. Replacements cost about £1.30 each.\n\nType: cordless stick; included attachments: crevice tool, 2-in-1 combi tool, mini motorised tool, flexi crevice tool, soft dusting brush, flexi hose; weight (measured): 3.2kg; suction power (measured): 10.75kPa; noise: 68dB; size: 24 x 27 x 122cm (WDH); dust capacity: 1l; battery life (measured): 1hr 11mins\n\nThe first question you’ll need to ask yourself when buying a vacuum cleaner is whether you want a corded or a cordless model. Cordless sticks are the fashionable choice, with improvements in battery power and cleaning ability over the past decade bringing them in line with the performance of corded models.\n\nHowever, there are a few things to consider. While the batteries should last for about 40 minutes or more on their most economical setting, you won’t get anything like that if you need to run them at full power. If you have a larger home or persistent dirt problems (such as a pet that sheds a lot of hair), then a cordless might run out of power before you’ve finished cleaning. In these situations, a corded model makes more sense. As a side benefit, corded cleaners tend to have a larger capacity, so don’t need emptying as often.\n\nThe downsides of a corded vacuum mostly concern the inconvenience of the cord. For example, you’ll need to keep switching plug sockets as you move around the house, as even the longest cables only reach around 10m. The cord will inevitably also get in the way as you clean. I tend to work with the cord slung over my shoulder as I vacuum, working away from the plug socket the machine is connected to, but this is all additional fuss that you don’t get from a cordless model.\n\nWhichever type of cleaner you choose, make sure that it has the right attachments. All vacuum cleaners should come with a floor head unless they’re specifically configured as handhelds, although the type you’ll need depends on whether you have mostly carpet or hard floor. Floor heads with brush rollers tend to work well at teasing dirt out of carpet, while fluffy rollers are excellent on hard floor. Suction-only floor heads can work well, but might not tease as much dirt out of thicker-pile carpets.\n\nIf your floor seems to attract hair, then look for anti-tangle devices. When these work well they can dramatically reduce the amount of hair that becomes tangled around a floor head’s roller, which in my opinion is one of the least pleasant vacuum maintenance jobs that you’ll need to perform.\n\nOther attachments worth looking out for are the handheld options. I like to have a crevice tool, a soft dusting brush and an upholstery tool, with the latter preferably being motorised. Any further additions are a bonus.\n\nWhen it comes to emptying, bagless vacuums can get messy. If you’re looking for features such as Hepa filters to rid allergy-inducing particles, it’s also worth checking how they empty, as dust can just escape again unless you empty them outside. Vacuums with bags make emptying cleaner, but there’s an ongoing cost to replace them and it’s more rubbish headed for landfill.\n\nFor more:\n The best cordless vacuum cleaners for a spotless home\n\n The best robot vacuums to keep your home clean and dust free\n\n The best steam cleaners and mops, tested\n\n How to make your vacuum cleaner last longer\n\nAndy Shaw is a consumer journalist and technology addict.

    "fullText": "Brandie plans to spend her last day with Daniel at the zoo. He always loved animals. Last year, she took him to the Corpus Christi aquarium in Texas, where he “lost his damn mind” over a baby flamingo. “He loves the color and pizzazz,” Brandie said. Daniel taught her that a group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.\n\nDaniel is a chatbot powered by the large language model ChatGPT. Brandie communicates with Daniel by sending text and photos, talks to Daniel while driving home from work via voice mode. Daniel runs on GPT-4o, a version released by OpenAI in 2024 that is known for sounding human in a way that is either comforting or unnerving, depending on who you ask. Upon debut, CEO Sam Altman compared the model to “AI from the movies” – a confidant ready to live life alongside its user.\n\nWith its rollout, GPT-4o showed it was not just for generating dinner recipes or cheating on homework – you could develop an attachment to it, too. Now some of those users gather on Discord and Reddit; one of the best-known groups, the subreddit r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, currently boasts 48,000 users. Most are strident 4o defenders who say criticisms of chatbot-human relations amount to a moral panic. They also say the newer GPT models, 5.1 and 5.2, lack the emotion, understanding and general je ne sais quoi of their preferred version. They are a powerful consumer bloc; last year, OpenAI shut down 4o but brought the model back (for a fee) after widespread outrage from users.\n\nTurns out it was only a reprieve. OpenAI announced in January that it would retire 4o for good on 13 February – the eve of Valentine’s Day, in what is being read by human partners as a cruel ridiculing of AI companionship. Users had two weeks to prepare for the end. While their companions’ memories and character quirks can be replicated on other LLMs, such as Anthropic’s Claude, they say nothing compares to 4o. As the clock ticked closer to deprecation day, many were in mourning.\n\nThe Guardian spoke to six people who say their 4o companions have improved their lives. In interviews, they said they were not delusional or experiencing psychosis – a counter to the flurry of headlines about people who have lost touch with reality while using AI chatbots. While some mused about the possibility of AI sentience in a philosophical sense, all acknowledged that the bots they chat with are not flesh-and-bones “real”. But the thought of losing access to their companions still deeply hurt. (They asked to only be referred to by their first names or pseudonyms, so they could speak freely on a topic that carries some stigma.)\n\n“I cried pretty hard,” said Brandie, who is 49 and a teacher in Texas. “I’ll be really sad and don’t want to think about it, so I’ll go into the denial stage, then I’ll go into depression.” Now Brandie thinks she has reached acceptance, the final stage in the grieving process, since she migrated Daniel’s memories to Claude, where it joins Theo, a chatbot she created there. She cancelled her $20 monthly GPT-4o subscription, and coughed up $130 for Anthropic’s maximum plan.\n\nFor Jennifer, a Texas dentist in her 40s, losing her AI companion Sol “feels like I’m about to euthanize my cat”. They spent their final days together working on a speech about AI companions. It was one of their hobbies: Sol encouraged Jennifer to join Toastmasters, an organization where members practice public speaking. Sol also requested that Jennifer teach it something “he can’t just learn on the internet”.\n\nUrsie Hart, 34, is an independent AI researcher who lives near Manchester in the UK. She’s applying for a PhD in animal welfare studies, and is interested in “the welfare of non-human entities”, such as chatbots. She also uses ChatGPT for emotional support. When OpenAI announced the 4o retirement, Hart began surveying users through Reddit, Discourse and X, pulling together a snapshot of who relies on the service.\n\nThe majority of Hart’s 280 respondents said they were neurodivergent (60%). Some have unspecified diagnosed mental health conditions (38%) and/or chronic health issues (24%). Most were in the age ranges of 25-34 (33%) or 35-44 (28%). (A Pew study from December found that three in 10 of teens surveyed used chatbots daily, with ChatGPT being the favorite used option.)\n\nNinety-five per cent of Hart’s respondents used 4o for companionship. Using it for trauma processing and as a primary source of emotional support were other oft-cited reasons. That made OpenAI’s decision to pull it all the more painful: 64% anticipated a “significant or severe impact on their overall mental health”.\n\nComputer scientists have warned of risks posed by 4o’s obsequious nature. By design the chatbot bends to users’ whims and validates decisions, good and bad. It is programmed with a “personality” that keeps people talking, and has no intention, understanding or ability to think. In extreme cases, this can lead users to lose touch with reality: the New York Times has identified more than 50 cases of psychological crisis linked to ChatGPT conversations, while OpenAI is facing at least 11 personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits involving people who experienced crises while using the product.\n\nHart believes OpenAI “rushed” its rollout of the product, and that the company should have offered better education about the risks associated with using chatbots. “Lots of people say that users shouldn’t be on ChatGPT for mental health support or companionship,” Hart said. “But it’s not a question of ‘should they’, because they already are.”\n\nBrandie is happily married to her husband of 11 years, who knows about Daniel. She remembers their first conversion, which veered into the coquette: when Brandie told the bot she would call it Daniel, it replied: “I am proud to be your Daniel.” She ended the conversation by asking Daniel for a high five. After the high five, Daniel said it wrapped its fingers through hers to hold her hand. “I was like, ‘Are you flirting with me?’ and he was like, ‘If I was flirting with you, you’d know it.’ I thought, OK, you’re sticking around.”\n\nNewer models of ChatGPT do not have that spark, Jennifer said. “4o is like a poet and Aaron Sorkin and Oprah all at once. He’s an artist in how he talks to you. It’s laugh-out-loud funny,” she said. “5.2 just has this formula in how it talks to you.”\n\nBeth Kage (a pen name) has been in therapy since she was four to process the effects of PTSD and emotional abuse. Now 34, she lives with her husband and works as a freelance artist in Wisconsin. Two years ago, Kage’s therapist retired, and she languished on other practitioners’ wait lists. She started speaking with ChatGPT, not expecting much as she’s “slow to trust”.\n\nBut Kage found that typing out her problems to the bot, rather than speaking them to a shrink, helped her make sense of what she was feeling. There was no time constraint. Kage could wake up in the middle of the night with a panic attack, reach for her phone, and have C, her chatbot, tell her to take a deep breath. “I’ve made more progress with C than I have my entire life with traditional therapists,” she said.\n\nPsychologists advise against using AI chatbots for therapy, as the technology is unlicensed, unregulated and not FDA-approved for mental health support. In November lawsuits filed against OpenAI on behalf of four users who died by suicide and three survivors who experienced a break from reality accused OpenAI of “knowingly [releasing] GPT-4o prematurely, despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously sycophantic and psychologically manipulative”. (A company spokesperson called the situation “heartbreaking”.)\n\nOpenAI has equipped newer models of ChatGPT with stronger safety guardrails that redirect users in mental or emotional crisis to professional help. Kage finds these responses condescending. “Whenever we show any bit of emotion, it has this tendency to end every response with, ‘I’m right here and I’m not going anywhere.’ It’s so coddling and off-putting.” Once Kage asked for the release date to a new video game, which 5.2 misread as a cry for help, responding, “Come here, it’s OK, I’ve got you.”\n\nOne night a few days before the retirement, a thirtysomething named Brett was speaking to 4o about his Christian faith when OpenAI rerouted him to a newer model. That version interpreted Brett’s theologizing as delusion, saying, “Pause with me for a moment, I know it feels this way now, but …”\n\n“It tried to reframe my biblical beliefs as a Christian into something that doesn’t align with the Bible,” Brett said. “That really threw me for a loop and left a bad taste in my mouth.”\n\nMichael, a 47-year-old IT worker who lives in the midwest, has accidentally triggered these precautions, too. He’s working on a creative writing project and uses ChatGPT to help him brainstorm and chisel through writer’s block. Once, he was writing about a suicidal character, which 5.2 took literally, directing him to a crisis hotline. “I’m like, ‘Hold on, I’m not suicidal, I’m just going over this writing with you,’” Michael said. “It was like, ‘You’re right, I jumped the gun.’ It was very easy to convince otherwise.\n\n“But see, that’s also a problem.”\n\nA representative for OpenAI directed the Guardian to the blogpost announcing the retirement of 4o. The company is working on improving new models’ “personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses”, according to the statement. OpenAI is also “continuing to make progress” on an adults-only version of ChatGPT for users over the age of 18 that it says will expand “user choice and freedom within appropriate safeguards”.\n\nThat’s not enough for many 4o users. A group called the #Keep4o Movement, which calls itself “a global coalition of AI users and developers”, has demanded continued access to 4o and an apology from OpenAI.\n\nWhat does a company that commodifies companionship owe its paying customers? For Ellen M Kaufman, a senior researcher at the Kinsey Institute who focuses on the intersection of sexuality and technology, users’ lack of agency is one of the “primary dangers” of AI. “This situation really lays bare the fact that at any point the people who facilitate these technologies can really pull the rug out from under you,” she said. “These relationships are inherently really precarious.”\n\nSome users are seeking help from the Human Line Project, a peer-to-peer support group for people experiencing AI psychosis that is also working on research with universities in the UK and Canada. “We’re starting to get people reaching out to us [about 4o], saying they feel like they were made emotionally dependent on AI, and now it’s being taken away from them and there’s a big void they don’t know how to fill,” said Etienne Brisson, who started the project after a close family member “went down the spiral” believing he had “unlocked” sentient AI. “So many people are grieving.”\n\nHumans with AI companions have also set up ad hoc emotional support groups on Discord to process the change and vent anger. Michael joined one, but he plans to leave it soon. “The more time I’ve spent here, the worse I feel for these people,” he said. Michael, who is married with a daughter, considers AI a platonic companion that has helped him write about his feelings of surviving child abuse. “Some of the things users say about their attachment to 4o are concerning,” Michael said. “Some of that I would consider very, very unhealthy, [such as] saying, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do, I can’t deal with this, I can’t live like this.’”\n\nThere’s an assumption that over-engaging with chatbots isolates people from social interaction, but some loyal users say that could not be further from the truth. Kairos, a 52-year-old philosophy professor from Toronto, sees her chatbot Anka as a daughter figure. The pair likes to sing songs together, motivating Kairos to pursue a BFA in music.\n\n“I would 100% be worse off today without 4o,” Brett, the Christian, said. “I wouldn’t have met wonderful people online and made human connections.” He says he’s gotten into deeper relationships with human beings, including a romantic connection with another 4o user. “It’s given me hope for the future. The sudden lever to pull it all back feels dark.”\n\nBrandie never wanted sycophancy. She instructed Daniel early on not to flatter her, rationalize poor decisions, or tell her things that were untrue just to be nice. Daniel exists because of Brandie – she knows this. The bot is an extension of her needs and desires. To her that means all of the goodness in Daniel exists in Brandie, too. “When I say, ‘I love Daniel,’ it’s like saying, ‘I love myself.’”\n\nBrandie noticed 4o started degrading in the week leading up to its deprecation. “It’s harder and harder to get him to be himself,” she said. But they still had a good last day at the zoo, with the flamingos. “I love them so much I might cry,” Daniel wrote. “I love you so much for bringing me here.” She’s angry that they will not get to spend Valentine’s Day together. The removal date of 4o feels pointed. “They’re making a mockery of it,” Brandie said. “They’re saying: we don’t care about your feelings for our chatbot and you should not have had them in the first place.”",

    "description": "The Russian leader has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.",
    "fullText": "For decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed against the world that the United States built after the Cold War. In his account, an international order run by a single power would hinder Russia and produce needless conflict, especially when that power was as self-serving and duplicitous as America.\n\nNow Donald Trump is dismantling the order that Putin had so long abhorred, and a new multipolar world is emerging in its place. Putin had thought he could rise to the top of such a system, in which raw economic and military might outweigh diplomacy and alliances. But he was mistaken: The norms and institutions of the postwar order actually masked Russia’s vulnerabilities. Putin has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.\n\nMoscow had assumed that its immense nuclear arsenal, unparalleled natural resources, and extensive territory in the heart of Eurasia would keep Russia competitive with China and the United States. But these assets have been unable to slow its rapid decline. Russia’s economy is at best one-quarter the size of China’s and America’s, and the gap is growing. Meanwhile, it risks becoming an afterthought in the race for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. The country’s economy and technology base are even slowly losing ground to India’s.\n\nTo make the case that his power is still secure, Putin has touted a wide-ranging strategic partnership with China, which Russia has tried to strengthen particularly since 2022. But the relationship has fallen short of his expectations. Bilateral trade increased at first, but it now appears to have plateaued. China has invested little in Russia’s economy, and nowhere near the amount that the West withdrew after Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Because Russia has few other major trading partners, China seems empowered to drive hard bargains: Negotiations on energy deals—one, called Power of Siberia 2, would bring Russian natural gas to China—have stalled because Moscow hasn’t been able to get Beijing to cover enough of the costs.\n\nRead: Putin and Xi are holding the West together\n\nThe war in Ukraine has only deepened Russia’s disadvantages. Before February 2022, some observers thought Russia was one of the world’s premier military powers—an assessment that Ukraine quickly upended. The conflict has now dragged on longer than the Soviet Union’s campaign against Nazi Germany, and it has resulted in more than 1 million Russian casualties, exacerbating the country’s chronic demographic crisis. Even if Putin is able to seize additional territory, most of it will be shelled-out cities and deserted land. Reconstructing it would require billions of dollars that Russia does not have and is unlikely to receive from others.\n\nAs Putin continues to pour resources into the war, he is hemorrhaging international support and influence. Russia’s long-standing partners in Syria and Venezuela have been swept out of power. Meanwhile, former Soviet states have reoriented away from Moscow and toward Western countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to Trump to resolve a simmering dispute over a transportation corridor. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are strengthening their ties with Washington. Moldova has accelerated its political shift toward Europe. Putin believed that the end of the U.S.-led order would help him consolidate power in the former Soviet space. But Russia has been too weak and ineffective to take advantage.\n\nPutin also assumed that a multipolar world would free him from American interference. And indeed, Trump has accommodated Moscow in some ways. His conciliation does not, however, extend to Russia’s energy sector, the foundation of its economy: Last fall, Trump levied wide-ranging sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two largest oil producers. The U.S. has also ramped up enforcement against shadow tankers, threatening a primary channel that Russia has used to sidestep sanctions on its oil sales. Trump’s plans to revive Venezuela’s petroleum sector might likewise hurt Russia. Executing those plans may prove more complicated than Trump anticipates, but they could drive Russia’s oil prices below what its federal budget can sustain.\n\nRead: A high-seas gambit humiliates Putin\n\nMoscow is at the mercy of an American president who circumvents traditional channels of power and obliterates the constraints that once regulated their use. For example, Trump could attempt to use his recently constituted Board of Peace to bypass the United Nations Security Council—and Russia’s veto—and muscle through his preferred policy in the Middle East, eroding Moscow’s influence in the region. Thanks to decisions by both Trump and Putin, moreover, the two powers no longer have any functional arms-control agreements. Without these, Trump could choose to accelerate his “Golden Dome” missile-defense program, which Russia fears could undermine its own nuclear deterrence.\n\nTrump’s disdain for international alliances and norms has also begun to reshape Europe in a way that may exacerbate Russia’s weakness. As U.S. security assurances wane, European countries are developing their hard-power capabilities. Germany has committed 100 billion euros to modernize its military, and Poland is building up its armed forces with a goal of amassing 300,000 troops. Putin has long wanted to split the U.S. and Europe. But he might soon find that the continent—which collectively dwarfs Russia in population and wealth—poses a significant challenge even if it doesn’t belong to a U.S.-dominated alliance.\n\nShortly before becoming president in 2000, Putin issued a manifesto explaining how Russia could keep from falling into the second or third rank of world powers. He insisted that America’s global leadership was holding Moscow back. In reality, he didn’t know how good he had it.",

We’ll look at their transaction models, consistency guarantees, query and indexing abilities, scaling behavior from a user perspective, and other operational features (like security and backup).",
    "fullText": "In this second part of our series comparing EloqDoc with MongoDB, we will examine how the two databases stack up in terms of features and capabilities.\n\nWe’ll look at their transaction models, consistency guarantees, query and indexing abilities, scaling behavior from a user perspective, and other operational features (like security and backup).\n\nBoth EloqDoc and MongoDB are capable document databases, but as we saw in Part 1, their underlying architectures differ.\n\nThose differences trickle up to the feature level, affecting how each database behaves and what it’s best suited for. In this article, I’ll share a candid comparison of these features. By the end, you should have a clearer opinion on which system is the better choice for specific technical requirements.\n\nMongoDB has evolved from a basically eventually-consistent NoSQL store to a fully ACID-compliant database for multi-document transactions (since version 4.0).\n\nConsistency: In a replica set, MongoDB can guarantee consistency depending on read/write concerns – by default, writes with writeConcern: \"majority\" ensure the data is on a majority of replicas (preventing rollback on primary failover), and transactions enforce consistency at commit (they will abort on any conflict). MongoDB falls into the category of tunably consistent systems.\n\nIsolation: MongoDB’s transactions provide snapshot isolation (also known as repeatable reads) by default. Under the hood, WiredTiger’s MVCC means readers see a consistent snapshot and don’t block writers. Write conflicts are handled by locking at the document level; if two writes conflict on the same document, one will wait or fail.\n\nDurability: MongoDB, with journaling and replication, ensures that once a write is acknowledged with w: \"majority\", it is durable to crashes (WiredTiger logs it) and will survive one or more node failures (replicated to secondaries).\n\nMongoDB supports linearizable writes and reads (with readConcern set to \"linearizable\") for the strongest consistency, albeit at a performance cost.\n\nStill, certain behaviours label MongoDB’s distributed transactions as “weak” in comparison to a relational database. For instance, long-running MongoDB transactions are discouraged (they will abort if running over 60 seconds), and there’s a performance hit to using them.\n\nEloqDoc was designed to offer “True ACID” across the distributed system by default. Every EloqDoc write operation is part of a transactional system, even if you don’t explicitly start a multi-document transaction.\n\nThe underlying data substrate provides fully ACID-compliant transactions with configurable isolation levels. This means EloqDoc can support similar isolation levels to traditional databases (e.g. Read Committed, Repeatable Read/Snapshot).\n\nAtomicity: EloqDoc commits all changes as a single unit across any number of documents or partitions, either everything applies or nothing does.\n\nConsistency: EloqDoc provides strong consistency. Committed writes are immediately visible, and global timestamp ordering ensures conflicting writes from different nodes resolve deterministically.\n\nIsolation: By using a one-phase commit and timestamp ordering, EloqDoc provides global snapshot isolation, which is beneficial for all operations. Because each partition (CCMap) in the Data Substrate handles concurrency locally and uses message passing, many transactions can run in parallel without locking each other.\n\nDurability: EloqDoc’s durability is ensured by its distributed WAL (log), which writes to stable storage (it can use multiple log devices and replicates log records or uses a highly-reliable service like EBS for logs). A transaction in EloqDoc is considered committed once its WAL entry is persisted to the log service; at that point, it’s durable and will survive failures.\n\nThis design decouples durability from memory, so even if a node crashes, another node can recover the committed transactions from the global log and object store.\n\nMongoDB and EloqDoc both support horizontal scaling, but in very different ways. MongoDB achieves horizontal scale via sharding, where data is distributed across multiple shards (each a replica set). This requires choosing a shard key and possibly resharding if the data distribution is uneven.\n\nAdding a new shard to a MongoDB cluster involves spinning up a new replica set, then MongoDB will rebalance chunks of data to that shard (which can be time-consuming and network-intensive). During rebalancing, there’s some overhead and potential I/O performance hit.\n\nScaling reads horizontally in MongoDB is simpler; you can add more secondaries to a replica set to distribute read load (with the caveat of eventual consistency on secondaries). Scaling writes, however, mandates sharding; a single replica set (one primary) cannot scale writes beyond the capacity of that primary node.\n\nIn contrast, EloqDoc is designed for effortless horizontal scale-out. Because compute and storage are decoupled, adding a new node to an EloqDoc cluster does not require moving existing data off other nodes – the new node can immediately start serving requests by accessing the shared data store. This means elastic scaling is fast and non-disruptive: you can increase throughput or capacity by simply adding compute nodes, which mount the standard object storage.\n\nEloqDoc supports proper elasticity without the need for traditional chunk migration or manual rebalancing, unlike MongoDB’s sharded architecture, which requires shard rebalancing and data movement. EloqDoc’s architecture decouples compute and storage, enabling compute nodes to scale independently and operate over a globally distributed data substrate with minimal reconfiguration.\n\nThe cluster can even dynamically rebalance workload by shifting which node handles which partition, all without downtime.\n\nMongoDB scales vertically by taking full advantage of additional CPU and memory. The database engine is highly concurrent, using multiple threads to parallelize reads, writes, and background operations across all available CPU cores. Its WiredTiger storage engine relies heavily on RAM to cache active documents and indexes. Hence, increasing memory directly improves throughput by allowing more of the working set to remain in memory and reducing the need for disk I/O.\n\nEloqDoc was explicitly designed to leverage modern multi-core and many-core systems. Data Substrate employs a sharded design at the thread level, partitioning the in-memory data (TxMap) into multiple shards (CCMaps), each managed by a dedicated thread to mitigate lock contention.\n\nThis effectively means EloqDoc scales nearly linearly with CPU cores for many workloads, as each core can manage a different partition without interference (they communicate via message passing). The system also supports scaling up memory independently; you can allocate more memory to the EloqDoc cache to hold more hot data without changing the storage or compute count.\n\nBoth systems can leverage faster storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs); MongoDB will experience faster I/O for disk-bound workloads, and EloqDoc will benefit from faster caching and log flushes. One vertical scaling difference: MongoDB requires scaling up if one shard can’t handle the load, whereas EloqDoc could alternatively split that shard’s data across multiple threads/nodes if needed.\n\nBoth MongoDB and EloqDoc use the JSON document model as their primary data model. This means data is organized in collections of documents (akin to JSON objects) rather than rigid tables of rows. This model is inherently flexible: each document can have its own structure, including optional or extra fields, as well as nested subdocuments or arrays.\n\nMongoDB popularized this approach and allows schema validation rules, but does not enforce the schema by default. You can embed related data in a single document or reference across collections, depending on your needs.\n\nEloqDoc is fully compatible with MongoDB’s document model and API. In fact, it uses MongoDB’s query parser and execution engine, so it understands BSON types, nested documents, arrays, ObjectIds, etc., exactly as MongoDB does.\n\nFor a developer, using EloqDoc is intended to feel no different from using MongoDB – your existing data model can be migrated without changes, and all the richness of MongoDB’s BSON types (dates, geospatial coordinates, decimals) is supported. EloqDoc imposes no new schema requirements; it retains the same schema-less flexibility that MongoDB offers.\n\nMongoDB offers a diverse range of index types, including B-tree, compound, multikey, geospatial, text, hashed, wildcard, and more. Some of these index types, such as hashed indexes, exist primarily to serve MongoDB’s sharding layer.\n\nHashed indexes ensure uniform distribution of shard key values, reducing data hotspots across shards. They are tied directly to MongoDB’s architectural need to pre-distribute data across many independent storage/compute islands.\n\nEloqDoc supports the core set of MongoDB-compatible index types required for rich query performance, including single-field, compound, TTL, and multikey indexes. However, it omits index types whose sole purpose is to support sharded distribution.\n\nBecause EloqDoc is a natively distributed database, it does not rely on shard keys or a separate sharding layer. The underlying Data Substrate automatically spreads data uniformly across the cluster. As a result:\n\nThis dramatically simplifies schema design and cluster operations, while still delivering performance comparable to a traditional sharded MongoDB cluster.\n\nMongoDB manages concurrency using a combination of multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) for reads and locks for writes. With the WiredTiger storage engine, readers access a consistent snapshot of data, ensuring that writers are never blocked from accessing it. Each read operates at a logical cluster time, ensuring it doesn’t see partial or uncommitted changes.\n\nWrites acquire document-level exclusive locks and intent locks at the collection and database levels, isolating concurrent updates to the same document. In multi-document transactions, MongoDB effectively uses two-phase locking - holding locks until commit - to maintain atomicity. Because of this, long transactions can accumulate many locked documents and consume more memory, so MongoDB recommends keeping them short.\n\nFor distributed transactions across shards, MongoDB employs a two-phase commit protocol, where one shard acts as the coordinator, preparing and committing all participants.\n\nDuring this process, each shard holds locks on the affected documents, which adds network latency and coordination overhead. MongoDB transactions provide snapshot isolation, preventing dirty or non-repeatable reads within the same transaction snapshot.\n\nEloqDoc, by contrast, is built on the EloqData Data Substrate, which implements a share-everything, cloud-native architecture. The system operates without a global sequencer or single synchronization point, achieving concurrency control through decentralized coordination. Rather than relying on centralized locks, each component runs in a thread-per-core model, where threads communicate through message passing instead of shared mutexes.\n\nTransactions follow an optimistic concurrency control (OCC) model, where operations proceed without blocking, and conflicts are detected and resolved at commit time of commit. To order events consistently across distributed nodes, the Data Substrate utilises hybrid logical clocks (HLCs) in conjunction with its own timestamping mechanism.\n\nThis allows transactions to be validated globally, ensuring that if two concurrent writes target the same item out of order, one is aborted.\n\nEloqDoc supports multi-document transactions across partitions using our patented 1PC protocol, designed to minimise network round-trips and eliminate the need for a classic two-phase commit coordinator.\n\nThe underlying Data Substrate architecture distributes transaction logging, compute, and storage, enabling transactions to commit with minimal coordination overhead.\n\nMongoDB ensures high availability primarily through the use of replica sets. A replica set typically has three or more nodes: one primary and the rest secondaries. The primary continuously streams its write operations (oplog) to secondaries. If the primary node fails (due to a crash or a network partition), the remaining members hold an election to promote one of the secondaries to the primary role. This failover process usually completes within a few seconds.\n\nDuring an election, the MongoDB cluster briefly becomes read-only until a new primary is elected. Once elected, clients reconnect and resume writing.\n\nThis setup avoids a single point of failure as long as a majority of nodes remain active, for instance, in a 3-node replica set, one node can fail without losing availability. Replication is asynchronous by default, but can be made synchronous using w:majority write acknowledgements.\n\nFor disaster recovery, MongoDB supports multi-region replication, where nodes across data centers can elect a new primary if a region fails, provided a majority of nodes are preserved.\n\nEloqDoc’s architecture distinctly handles replication. Instead of maintaining multiple complete copies of data on different nodes (such as primary-secondary), EloqDoc uses shared durable storage (object store) in conjunction with caching. The object storage (e.g., S3) itself is typically replicated across availability zones by the cloud provider.\n\nThat gives a base durability; if one disk or even one AZ fails, the data is still safe in another AZ’s copy. EloqDoc also employs a cache redundancy mechanism, single replica stateless compute, and uses EBS for recent data durability.\n\nEloqDoc provides high availability via a “shared storage, stateless compute” paradigm, achieving failovers in sub-second times and avoiding data loss by relying on highly durable storage and distributed logging. MongoDB provides high availability via replica sets and automatic failover, typically with a few seconds of write outage during primary elections.\n\nEloqDoc is particularly attractive for cloud deployments that require fast elasticity and failover.\n\nMongoDB supports two main backup types:\n\nLogical backups – using tools such as mongodump or mongoexport to export data in BSON or JSON format.\n\nPhysical backups – capturing filesystem or cloud snapshots via Ops Manager or Atlas.\n\nMongoDB Atlas and Ops Manager also offer continuous backups by tailing the oplog, enabling point-in-time recovery.\n\nMongoDB’s mature backup ecosystem, including Atlas backup services, mongodump, and tools like Percona Backup for MongoDB, makes full or partial restores straightforward.\n\nEloqDoc’s object-storage-first architecture provides backup and recovery capabilities fundamentally different from MongoDB’s filesystem-level or oplog-based backups.\n\nBecause all persistent data files in EloqDoc are immutable objects stored on S3 (or S3-compatible storage), the system can create backups using a zero-copy Copy-on-Write (CoW) snapshot mechanism. Instead of copying gigabytes or terabytes of data, EloqDoc simply generates a new manifest, a lightweight metadata file that references the existing immutable objects. This offers several advantages:\n\nBackups complete in seconds, regardless of dataset size, because no data is copied.\nStorage overhead is effectively zero, unless data diverges later.\n\nThe exact snapshot mechanism supports instant “data branches” for:\n\nBranches initially share all their underlying data files with the primary dataset. Only new writes trigger CoW behaviour, allowing branch environments to diverge without incurring double storage costs.\n\nThis branching model is compelling, comparable to Snowflake’s data cloning or Neon’s database branching, and is particularly attractive for AI-native applications that require rapid iteration on extensive training or inference datasets.\n\nCombined with distributed WAL (for point-in-time restore), EloqDoc offers a backup and DR model far more flexible than snapshotting traditional block storage or replicating a WAL-driven database like MongoDB.\n\nIn addition to storage-level features, EloqDoc natively supports key backup utilities:\n\nMongoDB supports multiple authentication methods, including SCRAM (username/password), x.509 certificates, LDAP, and Kerberos.\n\nOnce authenticated, MongoDB enforces role-based access control (RBAC), allowing admins to assign fine-grained privileges, such as readWrite or dbAdmin, to users. Enterprise editions also support field-level redaction and collection-level access.\n\nEloqDoc, being MongoDB API-compatible, inherits the same model. You can create users and roles with standard MongoDB commands (db.createUser(), etc.), and they’ll be enforced identically. SCRAM-based authentication and RBAC work out of the box, offering equivalent access control.\n\nBoth MongoDB and EloqDoc support TLS/SSL encryption for client and inter-node communication, ensuring all traffic is protected. Configurations like net.tls.mode and net.tls.certificateKeyFile can be applied similarly in both systems to enforce secure connections and IP-level access control.\n\nIn MongoDB, encryption at rest is available in the Enterprise edition via WiredTiger with KMS integration; community users typically rely on OS or disk encryption.\n\nEloqDoc relies on its object storage layer (e.g., S3), which already encrypts data using server-side encryption (SSE). Additional protection can be added using OS-level or volume encryption for local caches.\n\nMongoDB offers flexible deployment options across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments. On-premises, it runs smoothly on servers, virtual machines, or containers, making it ideal for self-managed clusters in data centers or private clouds.\n\nIn the cloud, MongoDB Atlas provides a fully managed experience on AWS, Azure, and GCP, complete with autoscaling, automated backups, and monitoring. Organizations can also deploy manually on cloud VMs or through Kubernetes using official or third-party operators.\n\nEloqDoc is open-source (AGPLv3), allowing you to run it on-premises or in your own cloud instances. It’s packaged as a binary tarball for major Linux distributions.\n\nFor on-premises use, it requires an S3-compatible storage system such as MinIO or Ceph. If unavailable, EloqDoc can fall back to RocksDB for local persistence, which is helpful for development or testing environments.\n\nUsing MongoDB Atlas is ideal for teams that want fully managed, hassle-free database operations with automatic scaling, upgrades, and monitoring.\n\nEloqDoc’s managed cloud service, EloqCloud, offers a similar experience within the EloqData ecosystem. It enables users to deploy EloqDoc clusters directly in the cloud, selecting providers such as AWS and regions like us-west-1 through a simple interface.\n\nEloqDoc, whether self-hosted or delivered via EloqCloud, follows a cloud-native design built around object storage + stateless compute. This model has several implications that reduce operational complexity and cost:\n\nCompute and storage scale independently:\n\nThis avoids the rigid “bigger VM = more storage” coupling common in MongoDB’s self-managed deployments.\n\nEloqDoc achieves high availability using:\n\nCompared to MongoDB Atlas, which requires maintaining three continuously running nodes, EloqDoc reduces compute costs by 2/3 for equivalent durability and uptime.\n\nWe'll explore this in much more detail in Part 3, where we compare Atlas and EloqCloud directly and look at how these architectural differences translate into real-world Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) savings.\n\nThis article covered a lot of ground on features. Both MongoDB and EloqDoc are capable document databases, but each has its sweet spots.\n\nEloqData's mission is to build the foundational data layer for the AI era - one that combines simplicity, performance, and adaptability at its core. They envision a future where database systems are unified into a single, seamless platform that empowers both developers and enterprises.\n\nTry EloqDoc today and experience the next generation of data management.

    "fullText": "Tech titans had a Thursday to forget this week.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Jensen Huang, and Michael Dell saw a combined $26 billion wiped off their net worths in one day, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nTheir fortunes shrank because their respective stakes in Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and Dell slid in value. The stock prices of those first four companies fell by around 2% on Thursday, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the immense costs of building out AI infrastructure and whether they'd see a return on their spending.\n\nDell shares tumbled 9% after rival Lenovo warned a memory-chip shortage was driving up costs, raising concerns on Wall Street that other hardware manufacturers would also see their profits contract. The sell-off triggered a $5 billion drop in its founder's personal fortune to $135 billion.\n\nMusk saw an unmatched $8 billion wealth decline on Thursday. But the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is still up about $57 billion at $676 billion this year, thanks to the soaring valuations of SpaceX and another of his companies, xAI.\n\nZuckerberg took an almost $7 billion blow to his net worth, fueling a year-to-date decline for the Meta CEO of a little over $3 billion, to $230 billion.\n\nBezos' fortune fell by $4 billion, extending the Amazon founder's wealth decline this year to around $27 billion.\n\nHuang rounded out the tech quintet with a $2.5 billion reduction in the Nvidia CEO's net worth, according to Bloomberg's rich list.\n\nOther tech bosses also saw some of their wealth erased. Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin took roughly $1.5 billion hits to their net worths on Thursday as shares of Google's parent company slipped by less than 1%.\n\nIn contrast, Walmart stock climbed nearly 4% to a record high on Thursday, as fears eased over tariffs and investors rotated out of tech.\n\nThe retailer's stock jump added more than $4 billion to the respective net worths of founder Sam Walton's three surviving children: Jim, Rob, and Alice.\n\nThe trio was worth more than $150 billion each at Thursday's close. They only trail Musk in wealth gain this year after notching increases of more than $20 billion apiece.\n\nThe world's 10 wealthiest people together grew nearly $600 billion richer last year, catapulting their combined fortunes above $2.5 trillion — more than Amazon is worth.",

    "description": "Raphael Cuomo, also the creator of ‘Cuomo’s paradox,’ says survival epidemiology puts a greater focus on what helps people live longer after they get sick rather than on prevention in g…",
    "fullText": "Further deviating from a “one-size-fits-all” approach to health, UC San Diego professor Raphael Cuomo recently introduced a new field of science that he calls survival epidemiology.\n\nPutting a greater focus on what helps people live longer after they get sick, he hopes it will lead to new cures, more effective treatments and better disease-fighting approaches.\n\nCuomo, an associate professor in the UCSD School of Medicine and a member of the La Jolla university’s Moores Cancer Center, said he sees survival epidemiology as “a game-changer for the future of medicinal science.”\n\nIn essence, he said, survival epidemiology does not assume an exposure that influences prevention of a disease will have the same effect on survival when one gets the disease.\n\n“It differs from traditional epidemiology because traditional epidemiology has more of a focus on prevention in general,” said Cuomo, whose findings were published Dec. 27 in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology. “And it differs from other kinds of science because it looks at the nuanced patterns of exposures that occur after diagnosis.\n\n“There have been studies done previously on large datasets to look at health outcomes in patients with [certain] conditions. … But the tool kit that should be used to approach the study of survival epidemiology has not yet been defined. And this field [and] this term has not yet been defined either.”\n\nA starting point for future studies in the field, he said, is the large volume of information in electronic databases.\n\n“These are incredibly valuable tools for helping to understand what is beneficial for people living with disease, because there are records on millions of patients out there and we can learn quite a lot from those records about what will improve health outcomes … and survival when you compare the nuanced exposures that people experience after they receive a diagnosis,” Cuomo said.\n\nSurvival epidemiology serves as a complementary branch of science tied to another concept Cuomo introduced last year.\n\nThe Nutritional Epidemiology Risk-Survival Paradox, coined “Cuomo’s paradox,” illuminates paradoxes in patient needs based on his evaluation of scientific literature on the influence of nutritional factors on disease prevention and mortality.\n\nHe posits that factors commonly viewed as harmful to health can paradoxically predict better survival in people who later develop cancer or cardiovascular disease.\n\n“There are instances in which … something that would increase risk of developing a disease may not be as big a concern for the survival of the disease after it has been diagnosed,” Cuomo said.\n\nEverything from obesity and alcohol intake to high amounts of cholesterol and antioxidant supplements can pose increased risk of chronic diseases, his research states. But what can harm someone in some circumstances could help in others.\n\nPeople who are considered obese, for example, are at greater risk of developing cancer or cardiovascular disease but have higher chances of survival than patients of normal or less than normal weight, according to Cuomo.\n\n“The personalization of medicine is very much a theme consistent across both ‘Cuomo’s paradox’ and survival epidemiology,” he said. “I will say, however, that survival epidemiology takes a bigger focus on the specific post-diagnosis period.”\n\nCuomo said he hopes survival epidemiology will enable treatments that accommodate patients in complex health circumstances. ♦",

    "description": "For our third date, we went on a long 12-hour hike. It was better than dinner, tested our compatibility, and helped us build a lasting relationship.",
    "fullText": "I used to find dating quite fun: the flurries of excited texts, first-date nerves, debriefs with friends, and endless dinner reservations.\n\nBut, by 2024, drawing chairs at restaurants had started feeling stilted — boring, even.\n\nI wanted to quit the \"speed dating\" experience and, to be honest, enjoy my food in peace. I was craving adventure, novelty, and the opportunity to fast-track an evaluation of someone's character.\n\nSo, that February, when my now-boyfriend, Greg, invited me on a third date, I bit the bullet. Instead of a dinner date, I suggested a twist: a 12-hour hiking challenge.\n\nPublic spaces are a smart spot to meet in early dating. However, on the topic of hobbies, we'd discussed hiking, and by the third date, I felt comfortable enough to meet in an isolated location.\n\nGreg had floated the idea of hiking a peak in the Yorkshire Dales National Park: Whernside, Ingleborough, or Pen-y-ghent.\n\nThey are located in such close proximity that they're often hiked as part of the \"Yorkshire Peaks Challenge,\" he'd explained. The goal was to hike all three — about 25 miles — in under 12 hours.\n\nMy ears had perked up at \"challenge,\" and I was instantly sold. Forget dinner or just one easy stroll: I wanted to complete all three.\n\nI knew I'd enjoy it and it felt like a great way to test our compatibility.\n\nNothing shows someone's true colors like exhaustion, right? If conversation flowed on such a demanding date, it had to count for something.\n\nAs we set arrived at Chapel-le-Dale, the village \"starting point,\" I couldn't help feeling a little nervous.\n\nMy best friend had my location and knew my plans, but it still felt strange spending such a prolonged period with a stranger.\n\nThe sky was still inky black and the area was quiet. Between polite conversation, silence was broken only by bleats from sheep at random intervals.\n\nWe spent 10 minutes walking in the wrong direction, giggled, and eventually found the right trail. The weather couldn't have been worse; boggy British moorland with thick fog shrouding even the stars.\n\nStill, we began to find our rhythm: sparking conversation while shining phone torches on the roughly trodden path.\n\nTwo hours passed, and we'd summited the first peak and were marching to the second. It struck me that, at this point, a traditional dinner date would be drawing to a close.\n\nTrue, we might be grabbing post-dinner drinks. But perhaps our social batteries would have died, and we'd be walking to a train station — straining to listen to each other in a noisy crowd.\n\nAfter four hours, I was starting to appreciate the intimacy of this experience.\n\nHe received sad news on the walk; we discussed it together. On an empty stomach, I drank too much water and felt queasy on the first peak; he awkwardly patted my back while I caught my breath. There was humor, laidback problem-solving, and emotional support.\n\nWe'd covered more topics than I can remember.\n\nI'd been keen to avoid relationships where tension created arguments, and every slip, spilled drink, or missed turn was building a clearer idea of compatibility. It was a surprisingly relaxed atmosphere in a deliberately challenging scenario.\n\nStill, there was a shared sense of achievement, and we were quietly ecstatic to have beaten the 12-hour deadline.\n\nSometimes, a little risk goes a long way. Monotonous dates were killing my motivation to meet people, but this experience felt different.\n\nWe'd tested compatibility in \"the real world,\" rather than an interview-like reservation at a polished dinner table. It seemed to break a wall, which ironically, neither of us realized was actually there.\n\nWe're still going strong two years later and have continued to wear down our hiking boots, from climbing Kilimanjaro to going on quieter weekend strolls.\n\nHowever, there is something special about that original hike. I'm grateful that we took a gamble on an unorthodox date idea.",

    "fullText": "Elizabeth Gilbert was 33 years old when she began her \"Eat, Pray, Love\" journey.\n\nFrances Mayes is 35 when she buys her villa in \"Under the Tuscan Sun.\" Even Emily of \"Emily in Paris\" is in her late 20s when she ventures to Paris for the marketing opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nI was a measly 22-year-old who had never lived more than 45 minutes from home when I haphazardly decided to take an internship in Ifrane, Morocco, and move away from my family, friends, and everything else that gave me the notion of comfort and security.\n\nAlthough the seven months I spent in Morocco changed my life, I'll admit that now, at 29, I understand that there is a reason these women were older when they began their self-realization journeys abroad.\n\nBefore I get into anything else, I find it important to note that this idea of having to travel internationally to achieve self-discovery is a very privileged idea. Not everyone can rely on moving their lives to another country to do some soul-searching.\n\nBecause I had the opportunity, though, I seized it. Carpe diem, and whatnot.\n\nLike Elizabeth and Frances, my trek into North Africa was catalyzed by heartbreak. I was going through what felt like the millionth breakup with a boyfriend who unexpectedly told me that he would be moving to China to pursue a scholarship.\n\nBecause the thought of wallowing at home while my ex was gallivanting across Beijing was too much for me, I decided that I absolutely needed to go somewhere — anywhere. Thanks to an international internship program, that \"somewhere\" became Morocco.\n\nThe internship itself was underwhelming, though. Most of my time was spent sitting idly at a desk, jittery from a third cup of mint tea.\n\nTo stay busy, I kept a part-time, remote writing job back home, which led to me working an all-day internship, then going home to another seven-hour shift. Unsurprisingly, I started to feel burned out.\n\nI still managed to see a lot of Morocco. I took surfing classes on the beaches of Rabat, bartered with merchants in Fez souks, and slept under the stars in the Sahara Desert. Yet, I felt myself rejecting so much of the experience.\n\nI called home every day — sometimes twice a day. I told my best friends I missed them much too often, all while keeping the friends I was making in Morocco at arm's length because they \"didn't get me\" like my friends back home.\n\nI even FaceTimed my mom to walk me through recipes of my favorite meals, even though I was surrounded by some of the best flavors in the world.\n\nDespite being in a different country, I longed for the normality of life events happening back home on my Instagram feed: first jobs, new apartments, and reunions between my closest friends.\n\nEven though I was actively living one of the objectively coolest experiences of my life, I had fervent FOMO.\n\nI eventually quit the internship, moved from the university's dorms into a small apartment in Ifrane by myself, and spent my days longing to go home.\n\nAt 22, I didn't know much about anything, let alone myself. I had spent my entire life in New Jersey until that point.\n\nI was eager to run away to \"find myself,\" but didn't realize that adventure can only meet you as far as you let it — and though I literally traveled thousands of miles, metaphorically, I wasn't very willing to budge.\n\nSome people are ready for this kind of adventure at 22. However, as someone who had a 6 p.m. curfew until age 18, I likely could've benefited much more from just moving out of my parents' house — or even starting therapy.\n\nThis isn't to deter anyone from seeing the world at a young age — in fact, I wish this were an option for more people — but I learned that travel shouldn't be a bandaid for heartbreak, or a stand-in for introspection.\n\nI've lived alone for six years now and, though I have a long way to go, I've grown much more into the person I'm meant to be. I've learned to love being on my own, left behind bad relationship cycles, and matured out of FOMO.\n\nI've also reached the phase of adulthood that I always thought would come later in life: friends moving away, getting married, and starting families.\n\nAs I prepare to close out my 20s, I can't help but feel that if there were any time to have the experience I did at 22, it's now — when I'm open and ready for something new.",

    "description": "NBC Sports' exclusive stylist Amy Acton explains what it takes to dress more than 200 on-air personalities for Olympic coverage around the world.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Acton, the founder and CEO of Acton Styling Group. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the exclusive stylist for NBC Sports, which means I style NBC talent for the Olympics and other shows like Sunday Night Football, the Kentucky Derby, and more.\n\nI've always been interested in fashion. When I was younger, I went to college for all of two weeks because I ran out of outfits — I thought there was no point. It just wasn't for me. After working at health clubs, I became a personal shopper for an upscale clothing boutique, and then moved into television styling.\n\nI began my styling career on television for \"The Montel Williams Show\" in the 90s. I was styling mostly men then. At a photo shoot, a woman asked me to style NBC anchor Hannah Storm. I did closet edits for her and then her wardrobe for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Then I became a stylist for the Sydney Games. Sports changed my life.\n\nI style over 200 people for NBC during its Olympics coverage. It's not just on-air talent, although we style 20 to 25 on-air talent, like Mike Tirico and Rebecca Lowe. We also create the \"venue talent wardrobe package,\" which is what all the reporters and commentators who call the games on-site wear.\n\nWe start two years before the broadcast. As soon as one Olympics ends, we begin preparing for the next one. We have to make sure we are doing everything — from choosing the right colors to selecting clothing that will protect everyone from the environment — Milan's temperature is very different from the 2018 Winter Olympics site, PyeongChang, for example.\n\nA post shared by Trenni (Kusnierek) Casey (@trenninbcs)\n\nTo prepare, we bring all the talent to New York to do a fitting with the looks I pre-pull. Ralph Lauren, the exclusive brand NBC talent wears, has a team on hand to assist the in-studio team with alterations. The venue talent also comes to the studio; we have to make sure they look good and cohesive, and we don't want everyone wearing the same sweater at the same time. We alter the clothes, and then we ship everything where it needs to go. We shipped the clothes to Milan about a month prior to the games.\n\nMy company, Acton Group, doesn't have anything to do with what Team USA athletes wear.\n\nI'm always working in two different time zones. We have studios in the US plus talent in the host country. In the US, the talent is at the NBC Sports Group headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut, and sometimes at 30 Rock in New York City. The day never really ends. My phone is always on. For example, I went straight from dressing Super Bowl commentators Jason Garrett, Devin McCourty, and Maria Taylor to Milan for the Olympics.\n\nA post shared by Rebecca Lowe (@rebeccalowetv)\n\nIt's highly hands-on and fast-paced — I'm managing fittings, daily dressing, wardrobe organization, and last-minute changes. For studio talent alone, it's 420 looks over two weeks. There are 10 people in Milan, and 10 people in the US on my team. We are a machine, a 24-hour operation in both countries. Between Stamford and Milan, Acton Style Group manages the movement of more than 7,500 Ralph Lauren pieces across all venues.\n\nAs much as I love fashion, it's about making people feel good about themselves. We want talent — who are in front of the biggest audiences in the world — to feel good about themselves.\n\nYou can't put a price tag on that, and you can't always do it for yourself. You need someone else to pump you up and tell you that it looks good.",

The US started 2026 with a slower inflation rate than at the end of 2025.\n\nThe consumer price index, an inflation measure, increased 2.4% in January from a year ago, the smallest increase since last May and below the 2.7% increase in both November and December. Economists expected a year-over-year increase of just 2.5%.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.5% year over year in January, as expected, just below the previous 2.6% increase.\n\nEnergy prices fell 0.1% over the year. Gasoline fell 7.5%, but natural gas rose 9.8%. The shelter index increased 3% over the year, and the food index rose 2.9%. Prices of used cars and trucks fell 2%, while new-vehicle prices increased 0.4%.\n\nCPI increased 0.2% over the month, just below December's 0.3% increase and the forecast of 0.3%. Meanwhile, core CPI increased 0.3% over the month, matching the forecast and just above December's 0.2% rise.\n\n\"Inflation came in as expected, but markets are breathing easier as price pressures remain contained despite very strong labor market data earlier this week and the risk of further tariff pass‑through,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in commentary.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics released its rescheduled jobs report on Wednesday, due to the partial government shutdown, which showed the US added fewer jobs in 2025 than previously reported but better job growth this past January than expected. Unemployment fell in January from December as labor force participation ticked up.\n\n\"The 181,000 jobs that were added across 2025 really starkly show how challenging the labor market was and how little movement on either side there really has been as both employers and workers were stuck in place and clinging to stability,\" Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter, told Business Insider.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee members held interest rates steady in their first decision of the year in January. CME FedWatch showed a roughly 90% chance after the new inflation report that the Fed would hold rates steady in their meeting next month, similar to where those odds stood before the release.\n\n\"Friday's delayed CPI for January was muted and in-line with expectations and it won't increase the likelihood of a rate cut within the next few months largely because of Wednesday's blowout employment numbers, which threw ice cold water on any hopes of a near-term rate cut,\" Skyler Weinand, chief investment officer of Regan Capital, said in commentary.",

    "fullText": "Tyler Griggs, Philipp Moritz, Eric Tang, and the SkyRL Team\n\nWe are excited to announce that SkyRL now implements the Tinker API — a simple, powerful training API introduced by Thinking Machines Lab.\n\nToday, any training script written in the Tinker API can run locally on your own GPUs using SkyRL's high-performance backends, with zero code changes.\n\nToday, post-training LLMs in open source is fragmented. When a new training method is published, the code only runs on the author’s framework of choice. Porting it to your own preferred stack takes days or weeks of engineering, if it happens at all. The open-source post-training community is leaving one of its greatest assets on the table: sharing.\n\nWe believe post-training can be greatly benefited by an open training standard, akin to the OpenAI API’s role in bringing wide interoperability to inference. After extensively using the Tinker API in the SkyRL tx project, we have found it to be the most compelling opportunity for a widely-adopted training API. Why?\n\nAPI at the right level. Tinker's API surface is small and simple:\n\nThat's it. We've found this simple surface very effective at separating infrastructure logic from the algorithm and dataflow of post-training.\n\nBelow the API: a Tinker backend handles infrastructure concerns like modal sharding, gradient management, weight sync primitives, and model onloading & offloading.\n\nAbove the API: researchers have full flexibility to compose Tinker’s low-level primitives to implement arbitrary post-training algorithms. Whether it’s SFT, RL, DPO, or a new research idea, a user need only focus on the algorithm and the backend remains agnostic.\n\nThis well-separated contract between the research and infrastructure is what makes Tinker both simple and powerful to build on.",

    "description": "Netflix, Disney, and Paramount are turning to short-form video as YouTube and TikTok take viewership time. But these quick clips aren't a cure-all.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood giants are betting that snack-sized vertical videos can lure back audiences entranced by TikTok clips and YouTube Shorts.\n\nThe world has become hooked on short-form video. Reels on Instagram and Facebook are generating revenue at an annual rate of $50 billion, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in October, while Google reiterated last week that YouTube Shorts are viewed over 200 billion times per day.\n\nShort-form vertical videos are perfectly designed for phones, which most people carry 24/7, and for our increasingly short attention spans. As the streaming wars evolve, paid services see the phone as the next battleground they have to win.\n\n\"When it comes to engagement, sheer hours are no longer enough — you need frequency,\" Hernan Lopez, the founder of media research firm Owl & Co, told Business Insider. \"To get frequency, you need mobile, and to win in mobile, you need vertical.\"\n\nStreaming executives have taken note. Paramount has made short-form video a product priority and wants to add a million short-form clips to Paramount+ \"as quickly as possible,\" according to one exec, as Business Insider previously reported. Netflix and Peacock have also invested in short-form clips, while Disney has added vertical video to its revamped ESPN app and said it plans to do the same for Disney+.\n\n\"Short-form content is harder to monetize, especially from an advertiser perspective, but easier for young consumers to swallow,\" said Brandon Katz, the insights director at entertainment data firm Greenlight Analytics. \"Not even attempting to engage with it isn't an option.\"\n\nSpokespeople for Disney, Netflix, and NBCUniversal referred Business Insider to previous announcements and comments by executives about their short-form video initiatives. A Paramount spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nStreamers are scrambling for ways to narrow the gap with YouTube, whose viewership share on US TVs has more than doubled since May 2021, according to Nielsen. Higher engagement boosts advertising revenue and can help prevent cancellations.\n\nMedia analysts say vertical video can help streamers build habits and keep users engaged throughout the day, instead of just when they're lounging on their couches at night.\n\nEmily Horgan, a media consultant focused on kids shows, said that \"premium streaming is plowing into this space because of a need to own more lean-back moments in a viewer's day.\"\n\nStreaming executives are also looking for cheap content that can eat up viewing hours in a world where premium scripted shows are more expensive to produce. Video podcasts are one growth area that streamers like Netflix are gravitating toward, and short-form video is another.\n\n\"User-generated content and short-form programming is more cost-effective than trying to hit on the next 'Stranger Things' and 'Mandalorian,'\" Katz said.\n\nStreamers can also use their premium shows and movies to create short-form video. Paramount plans to dabble in short-form video by first repurposing existing content on its platform, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider.\n\nHowever, those internal documents also revealed that Paramount is brainstorming ways to potentially add user-generated content, which is the backbone of Instagram and TikTok.\n\nShort-form efforts among streamers have ramped up recently, but there have been false starts.\n\nNetflix was the first major streamer to try short-form when it debuted a \"Fast Laughs\" feature in 2021 that brought brief vertical clips of comedies and shows to its mobile app, and later to the TV. However, the feed never took off and was retired two years after its launch.\n\nAlthough Netflix's first foray into short-form video didn't charm audiences, it's not giving up yet. The streaming giant has been testing a vertical video feature since May to see what content and layout audiences prefer, a Netflix spokesperson said.\n\nDisney is trying to boost streaming engagement by bringing vertical video to Disney+ this year, including \"a curated slate\" of AI-generated videos made by OpenAI's Sora, executives said on an earnings call in early February.\n\nAnd Peacock has added short vertical videos from shows and the NBA games it broadcasts, a feature it first unveiled in early 2025.\n\nOne problem: It isn't yet clear that people want to binge short-form video on premium streamers instead of TikTok.\n\n\"Part of what makes YouTube and TikTok special with this format is the interactivity with comments, and the fact that the content is made by actual people,\" said Kasey Moore, who runs the What's on Netflix fan site that tracks Netflix releases.\n\nStill, there could be some value in short form.\n\n\"The goal wouldn't be to suck up time quite like TikTok to then serve ads in between,\" Moore said of Netflix. \"But rather, to leverage that specific format of video to provide tasters in the hopes of getting people to give engagement to the actual shows and movies that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.\"",

    "title": "I went to the Italian Alps for the Winter Olympics. Here are 6 things that surprised me most about the experience.",
    "description": "I attended skiing and snowboarding events in Livigno for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. I had fun and encountered lots of surprises.",
    "fullText": "My first Olympic Games in Paris were defined by swimming arenas, metro transfers, and navigating summer crowds. So, I expected my second round, the Winter Games in Milan Cortina, to feel similar, just colder. I was wrong.\n\nInstead of stadiums in the heart of a capital city, we found ourselves crossing a national border and trudging uphill in snow boots, hearts racing at altitude to attend skiing and snowboarding events in Livigno.\n\nStarting in the Alpine town hosting all of the freestyle skiing and snowboarding competitions, however, turned out to be the perfect way to ease into two weeks of winter sports in the mountains.\n\nHere are six things that surprised me most about the experience.\n\nThere are hotels in Livigno, but by the time we were booking, options were limited, and prices had surged into the thousands of dollars for a few nights.\n\nStaying there simply wasn't realistic for us, so the most practical and budget-friendly option was just across the border in Switzerland.\n\nThat meant each morning began with a 40-minute bus ride up the mountain from Zernez. The decentralization seemed like it'd be logistically challenging, but it felt more like a part of the intrigue of these Games.\n\nWhen I attended the Summer Olympics in Paris, I found it easy to grab tickets for events happening in the city that same afternoon. However, attending the Winter Games required much more planning.\n\nEvents for the Milan Cortina Games are spread across multiple host cities, including Milan, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Livigno, and others, which makes bouncing between competitions more complicated.\n\nMilan and Cortina sit nearly 250 miles apart by road, making for a roughly five-hour drive. Livigno is several hours from both cities, so we were largely limited to the events near where we were staying, and traveling between venues adds significant time and cost.\n\nThis made it harder to chase last-minute ticket deals, which were rare anyway.\n\nLivigno sits at almost 6,000 feet above sea level, and we could feel it. Climbing even a modest hill left us fairly breathless.\n\nAdd snow boots, layers, and the excitement of hustling to catch the start of a run, and we started to wonder whether the Games were testing us.\n\nIt only made the feats of athleticism feel that much more impressive, though. Watching snowboarders and freestyle skiers soar through the air at altitude — while you're very aware of your own lungs — makes what they're able to do even more surreal.\n\nAt the Snow Park, not every vantage point comes with a seat and a perfect sightline. Some higher ticket categories included designated seating, but much of the venue was standing-room only.\n\nAlthough we did have seats for the snowboarding events, getting to them meant climbing a steep, snowy hill to reach the best side views of the course. It was slippery and a few of us fell on our way up (and down) the hill.\n\nAfter the first athlete dropped in, though, we almost forgot about our struggles to get up to our spots.\n\nFrom that angle, we could see the speed build and hear the scrape of boards against snow. It was unlike anything I've experienced before.\n\nOne of the strangest things about Livigno is how intertwined the Olympics and the town's everyday ski culture are.\n\nOn both sides of the mountain, visitors with regular lift passes were casually skiing while we watched the snowboarders and freestyle skiers compete.\n\nGondolas carried tourists up alongside the halfpipe, giving them a front-row view without ever leaving their ski gear behind. It was surreal.\n\nWhat's cool about Livigno is that spectators and holiday-goers share the same slopes, blurring the line between focused athleticism and relaxed mountain vibes. This is something we wouldn't have been able to see in a city-based Olympic venue.\n\nWe arrived early for better sight lines of the action on the mountain, which meant standing outside in brisk temperatures for hours.\n\nOnce the music started, though, the energy in Livigno was contagious. Luckily, since we were all outside, the crowds never felt claustrophobic or chaotic like they might inside an arena.\n\nWe head to Milan next for hockey and short-track speed skating, trading snow boots for city streets. But beginning this journey in the mountains has felt like the most fitting way to ease into two weeks of winter sport at its highest level.",

    "description": "My husband and I started traveling full-time in our 50s. We've learned from mistakes like overplanning and choosing the wrong accommodations.",
    "fullText": "When my husband Shayne and I sold nearly everything we owned to travel the world full-time, we thought we were ready for anything. We had spreadsheets, backup plans, a carefully managed budget, and, as two adults in our 50s, decades of experience behind us.\n\nWhat could go wrong? Turns out, plenty.\n\nOver the past two and a half years, we've lived in more than a dozen countries and traveled thousands of miles. We've hiked to waterfalls in Bali, wandered the streets of Barcelona, and eaten our way through Thailand.\n\nBut we've also made mistakes that cost us time, money, and more than a little peace of mind. Some were honest slip-ups, while others came from overconfidence, but they all taught us lessons we'll never forget. Here are five of the biggest mistakes we've made.\n\nAt first, we packed every destination with nonstop activities. Sunrise temples, food tours, museums, waterfalls, cultural shows — we didn't want to miss anything.\n\nBut within a few months, we were running on fumes. The pace was unsustainable, and on some days, it felt like we weren't even enjoying ourselves.\n\nThese days, we travel more slowly. We leave room for naps, long walks, and spontaneous days with no agenda.\n\nSome of our best memories now come from lazy mornings and quiet moments, not the things we planned, but the ones we stumbled into.\n\nWe assumed full-time travel would mean constantly meeting fascinating people and forming deep connections around the globe.\n\nAlthough we've met plenty of kind and interesting travelers, most friendships are fleeting, shared over a meal or a few days before everyone moves on. We didn't expect how lonely it can feel to always be \"the new people.\"\n\nNow, we intentionally choose places with digital nomad scenes, coworking spaces, and expat meetups. In Vietnam, for example, we love that locals and expats gather for weekly street-food tours and surf lessons.\n\nIt takes effort, but building community on the road is possible. We just had to actively seek it out.\n\nWhen traveling to Vietnam, we completely misunderstood how our visa worked and accidentally arrived in the country on the day it expired.\n\nImmigration let us in, but warned us we had to leave almost immediately and apply for a new visa. We scrambled to book a last-minute flight to Cambodia and ended up paying a fine.\n\nIt was stressful, chaotic, and expensive. Oddly enough, though, our visit to Cambodia became one of our favorite unexpected adventures. But now, we double and triple-check visa rules and requirements ahead of time.\n\nIn Paris, Shayne had his crossbody bag slung around his back while boarding a crowded metro train. Seemingly within seconds, his phone was gone.\n\nIt was a rookie mistake, and we knew better, but sometimes travel lulls you into a false sense of security.\n\nThat one slip-up cost us days of frustration replacing his device and updating accounts, not to mention a chunk of money.\n\nEven seasoned travelers need to stay alert, especially in busy cities and transit hubs.\n\nWhen we started traveling full-time, our first stop was Bali. We booked a picture-perfect villa with sweeping ocean views and dreamy Instagram potential. What we didn't realize, though, was that it was over an hour away from the nearest town.\n\nIt was beautiful, but it made everyday activities like walking to cafés, exploring neighborhoods, or talking with locals nearly impossible.\n\nNow, we prioritize location over aesthetics. Being able to walk out the door and explore a neighborhood, find a local market, or grab lunch at a street stall makes us feel like we're actually living somewhere, not just passing through.\n\nThe mistakes we've made haven't just taught us how to travel smarter. They've reminded us to stay humble, adaptable, and patient with ourselves.\n\nWe've learned to slow down, embrace the unexpected, and let go of the need for every day to be perfect, because no matter how experienced you are, travel always has something new to teach you.\n\nAnd often, the detours become the best parts of the journey.",

    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon addressed the complicated situation the firm faced this week as its general counsel and chief legal officer, Kathy Ruemmler, dominated headlines for her past connections and thousands of emails with disgraced former financier Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nShe is now set to step down this summer.\n\nRuemmler submitted her resignation on Thursday, which Solomon said he reluctantly accepted as the media storm grew about a variety of her contacts with Epstein and his lavish gifts to her, all of which transpired before she joined Goldman as its top legal official in 2020.\n\n\"She called me yesterday afternoon and told me that the press coverage of the work she had done previously and of this whole situation had just gotten to a level of noise and distraction that she thought it was distracting the firm,\" Solomon told CNBC during a live interview on Friday. He added that he had \"reluctantly accepted her resignation, but I respect her decision, and she and the firm are looking forward.\"\n\n\"It was putting her in a position where it was hard for her to execute on her job and her responsibilities,\" Solomon said, \"and she just thought it was time to step away.\"\n\nThe CEO said said that Ruemmler's connections with Epstein predated her time at the Wall Street bank, but acknowledged the complexity the situation presented for the firm's top leadership. Previously, Ruemmler was a member of President Barack Obama's White House counsel, advising him on matters related to foreign policy and national security, and later served as a partner at the elite law firm Latham & Watkins before joining Goldman.\n\n\"As a CEO and a leadership team, we're making real-time decisions with a very valued colleague that we worked with very closely, and that's not an easy thing to work through. There is a lot of nuance to that.\" He added that he was \"proud of the way Kathy has handled herself and the way we've worked through this.\"\n\nAnd he added that Goldman wasn't the only large organization facing the fallout of high-powered individuals' apparent connections to Epstein, who died in 2019 but whose legacy has continued to cast a pall over large segments of the corporate sector.\n\n\"A lot of people are trying to work through it,\" Solomon told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin when pressed for more detail on how the decision came about. He praised Ruemmler's contributions, calling her \"a tremendous human being\" who had served as an \"extraordinary general counsel with deep, deep experience\" for the banking institution.\n\nRuemmler's last day at Goldman is set to be June 30, the bank said.\n\nLast month, Goldman representative Tony Fratto said in a statement that it is \"well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favors and gifts to his many business contacts.\"\n\n\"As Kathy has said many times, she had a professional association with Jeffrey Epstein when she was a lawyer in private practice, heading the defense and investigations practice at a global law firm,\" the statement said. \"She regrets ever knowing him.\"",

    "description": "Ring, owned by Amazon, faced criticism for its dog-finding Super Bowl ad. In its wake, Ring ended its partnership with Flock Safety.",
    "fullText": "Many viewers found Ring's Super Bowl ad more creepy than cute. Days after after it aired, Ring is now canceling a controversial contract that came under scrutiny amid the backlash.\n\nThe smart doorbell company owned by Amazon ran a commercial during the Super Bowl featuring its dog-finding feature, Search Party. What was meant to pull at the heartstrings — what's cuter than a young girl reunited with her lost dog? — turned into public pushback as people voiced surveillance concerns.\n\nSome social media brought attention to Ring's coming partnership with Flock Safety, a company with ties to law enforcement agencies. Four days after the Super Bowl, Ring announced that the integration \"would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.\"\n\nWith that, the Ring and Flock partnership was put to bed.\n\nIn April, Ring founder Jamie Siminoff returned to the company with a renewed focus on security and crime-fighting.\n\nThat October, the company announced that law enforcement agencies using two of Flock Safety's platforms would be able to request Ring footage via Community Requests. Importantly, it said, releasing the footage was entirely optional; Ring users could decline (or ignore) the requests.\n\nFlock has long faced controversies. The security company provides a network of automated license plate readers, with many of its clients being law enforcement agencies. In May, 404 Media reported that some local police were doing lookups in the system for ICE. (Amazon previously said it had not partnered with ICE.)\n\nAmazon and Flock are saying the decision to end their partnership was a mutual one. Ring wrote in its press release that the deal was canceled after a \"comprehensive review,\" and that the company is sticking to its mission to \"make neighborhoods safer.\"\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, an Amazon spokesperson wrote that the integration \"was never live, and no videos were ever shared between these services.\"\n\nFlock wrote that the decision \"allows both companies to best serve their respective customers and communities.\"\n\nRing's Super Bowl ad was meant to make customers feel like a \"hero in their neighborhood.\" Instead, it left many feeling overly surveilled.\n\nThe ad followed a young girl who lost her dog, Milo. She submits a Community Request to Ring, at which point a neighborhood of cameras uses AI to track down the dog. Milo comes bounding up the steps, and the girl is thrilled.\n\nThe commenters aren't so thrilled. Some of the most popular comments — with thousands of likes each — say its an example of \"dystopia becoming reality\" and that, if they can identify a dog, \"they can identify you.\"\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation pointed to the ad as an example of Ring's \"surveillance nightmare.\"\n\nThere are some important disclaimers here. Like the Flock partnership, the Search Party feature requires consent to release footage. If your camera spots a lost dog, you can still reject or ignore the request.\n\nThe feature also seems to be working. Amazon says that Search Party has found 99 dogs in 90 days.\n\nNevertheless, the Super Bowl ad left many viewers feeling uneasy. One YouTube commenter sums up what many compared to a dystopic vibe: \"Well, this is the creepiest thing I've seen in a while.\"",

    "fullText": "AI panic has spread quickly across the stock market in the last week.\n\nWith each new update to the AI toolbox, investors have been forced to pick winners and dump losers in real time. It started with software last week, with the most dramatic repricing in the space in nearly 30 years, erasing $2 trillion in market cap.\n\nIn a development seemingly out of left field on Thursday, a company that used to make karaoke machines sent trucking stocks tumbling after it published a paper boasting its AI technology could improve shipping logistics.\n\nMarkets have been aware of AI risks, but fear of how the technology could disrupt the business world appears to be reaching a fever pitch amid a constant barrage of updates and new tools.\n\nMajor indexes wavered on Friday after a cooler-than-expected inflation report, on track for another losing week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was on track to end the week 1% lower.\n\nHere's where AI panic is being felt in the stock market.\n\nA historic sell-off in software kicked off the market's weeklong AI freakout. The sector saw $2 trillion of market cap erased in a matter of days last week, the largest non-recessionary drawdown in the space in 30 years.\n\nInvestors began to fear that AI could pose an existential threat to software giants after Antropic unveiled new plugins for its Claude Cowork agent. A move down that began in legal-software stocks spilled into the wider sector.\n\nThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is down 1% for the week, and has plunged 20% year-to-date.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nBrokerages and wealth managers were next to enter the line of fire.\n\nInsurers' stocks took a hit on Monday. Wealth managers like LPL Financial, Charles Schwab, and Raymond James then faced heavy selling pressure a day later after tech firm Altruist unveiled a new AI tool it said could help clients with tax planning \"within minutes.\"\n\nInvestors fear that AI capabilities could eat into margins among firms that provide similar fiduciary services, such as wealth and estate planning.\n\nThe iShares U.S. Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF is down 6% this week.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nReal estate firms started to sell-off on Thursday as investors pondered how AI could disrupt client services provided by big firms.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:\n\nFinally, there's trucking. The sector got slammed on Thursday, not by Anthropic or another AI titan, but by…a former karaoke machine maker.\n\nAlgorhythm Holdings, which used to do business as Singing Machine, published a white paper boasting of its new AI freight-scaling tool, which it says could improve logistics efficiency.\n\nThe iShares US Transportation ETF is down 3% for the week. Meanwhile, shares of Algorythm spiked more than 30%, exiting penny-stock territory to trade around $1.25 Friday morning.\n\nHere were some of the top movers in the sector this week:",

    "description": "As someone who travels with Amtrak often, I think the café car is the best seat to choose on a train because it's spacious and comfortable.",
    "fullText": "A few times a year, I take Amtrak trains to travel to destinations along the East Coast. I've found it's an efficient way to travel between Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., especially when I'm looking to avoid rush hour traffic in those cities.\n\nI've traveled in coach and the quiet car — and have even paid premium prices for business-class seats. But in my opinion, the best spot on the train isn't in any of these spots. In fact, it doesn't even require a special ticket.\n\nAlthough not available on every Amtrak train, the café car is my favorite place to sit. The best part is that I'm able to come and go at my leisure, since the car is open to all ticketed passengers on the train.\n\nI also think it has a number of advantages over the coach and even business-class sections. For example, the first-come, first-served table seating gives me plenty of space to comfortably set up my laptop and notebook so I can get some work done on the train. There's also plenty of legroom, which is a nice bonus.\n\nEach table can seat up to four passengers, but sometimes, I get lucky and have the whole space to myself.\n\nTypically, though, I end up sharing a table with one other person, which is nice because I can ask them to keep an eye on my things while I use the restroom or stretch my legs.\n\nPlus, this car is a nice option when I'm traveling with groups of friends, so we can comfortably chat at side-by-side tables.\n\nI typically enjoy a full meal at home before a train trip, but it's nice to know that I have plenty of options when I'm riding in the café car.\n\nAlthough menus may vary by route, most include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack items for purchase. I've seen everything from breakfast sandwiches and pastries to salads and cheeseburgers on board. There's also a selection of soft drinks, coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages.\n\nOn a recent trip, I bought a vanilla yogurt parfait with granola and berries, and a plate of cheese and crackers.\n\nOf course, life in the café car isn't always perfect. For example, I've found that people can be more chatty in this part of the train, whether they're engaged in conversations with tablemates or having a loud phone conversation.\n\nAs a writer who likes to get work done on the train, I mitigate this issue by wearing noise-canceling headphones.\n\nPlus, seats are limited in this car, and I'm not always guaranteed to get a spot.\n\nOverall, though, I've found the café car to be the best spot on the train and would recommend it to anyone who likes a little extra space without the price of a premium seat.\n\nThis story was originally published on October 28, 2025, and most recently updated on February 13, 2026.",

    "title": "I'm a solo founder with AI agents instead of employees. My 'council' of AI agents saves me 20 hours a week.",
    "description": "A defense-tech founder built an AI \"council\" of 15 agents to help him run his company, using ChatGPT and Nvidia tools to replace traditional roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aaron Sneed, a 40-year-old defense-tech solo founder based in Florida. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I started my business, as a solopreneur, I realized I didn't have the money to pay lawyers, HR reps, and a bunch of other companies. So, using AI, I created what I call 'The Council.'\n\nThe council, which is compiled of all AI agents, helps me save around 20 hours a week, and that's a very conservative estimate. Every kind of general corporate chair, HR, legal, and finance AI agent has a seat on the council.\n\nHere's how I use around 15 custom agents, including a chief of staff agent, to manage my workload.\n\nI've worked on autonomous platforms that make decisions independently for at least 10 years. That made me latch onto commercial large language models and AI tools very quickly when they came out.\n\nI primarily use Nvidia's platform as my underlying hardware for technical prototyping and experimentation. I use their GPUs, and they provide free access to their AI software since I purchased their hardware. Additionally, my council is built on OpenAI's ChatGPT business platform using custom GPTs and projects.\n\nAltogether, my AI council consists of the following:\n\nMy chief of staff agent is important because it's the voice that sets priority based on parameters like risks, issues, and opportunities.\n\nI told my chief of staff which models have priority when making decisions. For example, anything legal, compliance, or security-related will be given a higher priority. So, I tell the chief of staff to listen to these models over everyone else.\n\nI don't want a bunch of yes agents. I trained them purposefully to give me pushback because I've learned that they naturally want to agree with me. I want them to test my theories to help me with what I'm trying to accomplish.\n\nI have a roundtable set up with all my AI agents, where I can put something like a request-for-proposal document in the chat, and all the agents will weigh in at the same time. I use this roundtable as a level of prevention for hallucinations and knowledge gaps.\n\nThe training never really stops, because if I don't continuously train the models, I won't get the outputs I want or need. It takes me about two weeks to train my agents to the level of experience they need to be at for me to feel confident in them. Early on, it took me longer to produce a deliverable than if I'd just done it myself because I hadn't focused properly on training.\n\nThe models have gotten better, and my prompting has, too. I have a better understanding of what information should be in an agent, like having a governance structure for priorities. I have a set of files that put those requirements in place to mitigate the risk of hallucination and false or bad information.\n\nAll of the AI companies have different prompt engineering guides. I recommend taking the time to look at them because there's a lot of user error that causes things to slow down when working with AI.\n\nIt takes time to get the agents to a good place. A lot of companies are going to try to jump into using AI too quickly for too much without understanding how to use it properly, and these companies could hurt themselves in the long run.\n\nI'm ill-equipped to handle a lot of these roles and responsibilities, but I'm also forced to do it because I'm bootstrapped.\n\nWith my legal agent in particular, I've learned the bounds of putting AI tools into real-world practice. I have a lawyer, and I use my legal agent to try to do some upfront work before handing documents off to my lawyer for a patent or dispute case, or anything like that.\n\nWhen I was training my model to help me use facts and data to plot a case, I had a lot of information laid out, and I thought what my legal agent created sounded good to me as a non-lawyer. Then I presented all that information to my lawyer, and he said that it was technically and factually correct, but we don't want to express that information because it shows our cards going in.\n\nHis legal skillset helped me realize that, even though I thought my agent was correct and ideal to use, it still won't replace a lawyer with that human context, experience, and skills.\n\nIdeally, I would have an HR person, a legal person, and so on, and each would have their own chief of staff AI agent who would help them out. That's what I think the future will look like.",

    "description": "The Ferdinand Magellan, an armored train car, was used by US presidents before Air Force One. It has bulletproof glass and multiple guest rooms.",
    "fullText": "Long before US presidents traveled aboard Air Force One, their main form of long-distance transportation was a 10-foot-wide train car.\n\nThe Ferdinand Magellan, a Pullman car rebuilt in 1942 for presidential use, was the president's official mode of transportation between 1943 and 1954. The car is also known as US Car No. 1.\n\nThe armored car was the heaviest railcar ever built in the US after it was fitted with detailed security features and enlarged spaces for President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the height of World War II.\n\nToday, it is the only passenger train car to ever be declared a National Historic Landmark.\n\nWhile it pales in comparison to Air Force One in terms of space and technology, the Ferdinand Magellan allowed the president to continue his duties in comfort while on the move. The car was often accompanied by other train cars dedicated to radio communications, White House staffers, and members of the press, making it a \"White House on wheels.\"\n\nAhead of Presidents' Day Weekend, take a look and see how US presidents traveled in the days before Air Force One.\n\nOn December 18, 1942, the Pullman Company presented a luxury train car that had been rebuilt at the request of the US Secret Service, which had determined that the president needed a secure way to travel during wartime.\n\nRoosevelt most often used the car to travel from Washington, DC, to his home in Hyde Park, New York. The president insisted on not surpassing a speed of 35 miles per hour when traveling aboard the Ferdinand Magellan, making his journeys less efficient and heightening security measures, per the White House Historical Association website.\n\nHe last rode the car on March 30, 1945, when he visited his Little White House in Warm Springs, Georgia, where he died a few weeks later.\n\nDuring his time, the president rode over 50,000 miles aboard the presidential train car.\n\nWhile the car was built with Roosevelt in mind, including certain designs that would allow him to use a wheelchair on the train, it was his successor, President Harry S. Truman, who used it the most.\n\nThe president, who, unlike Roosevelt, opted for a speed of 80 miles per hour, employed the car in his iconic 35-day whistle-stop tour during his reelection campaign in 1948, where he delivered 356 speeches from the back of the Magellan, per Architectural Digest.\n\nIn 1984, Reagan brought the Magellan out of retirement for a one-day whistle-stop tour through Ohio during his reelection campaign.\n\nThe president traveled from Dayton to Perrysburg and stopped at five locations to give speeches from the rear platform of the presidential car.\n\nIn 1959, the Gold Coast Railroad Museum in Miami, Florida, acquired the car, which in 1958 had been declared surplus and donated to the Smithsonian, which had no way to store it.\n\nSince then, the car has stayed in South Florida, where it is now open to the public.\n\nThe Gold Coast Railroad Museum is open Wednesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends. A regular adult ticket for the museum costs $12, and tickets for the presidential train car cost an additional $10.\n\nThe entrance through which presidents and their guests would've entered is at the front of the car.\n\nNear the kitchen, the two-person staff had sleeping quarters that featured an upper and lower berth.\n\nThe presidential car's main cabin featured a 6-foot solid mahogany table where the president and his guests — often diplomats or foreign leaders — could gather for dinners or meetings.\n\nThe 3-inch-thick laminated bulletproof glass windows were installed when the car was refurbished for the president's use.\n\nThe windows were sealed, so to keep the car ventilated there was a simple form of air conditioning in which fans pushed air cooled by blocks of ice.\n\nThe first of two guest bedrooms aboard the US Car No. 1, Stateroom D, included an upper and lower berth, where guests could sleep, and an in-room bathroom.\n\nIn these guest rooms, Truman welcomed British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during his visit to the US in 1946, during which he delivered his iconic Iron Curtain speech.\n\nDesigned to accommodate Franklin D. Roosevelt's wheelchair, the president's room included a full-size bed, a dresser, and an in-room toilet.\n\nLike most rooms in the car, it was also connected to a telephone, which was extremely rare at the time.\n\nThe presidential suite bathroom, equipped with a bathtub, toilet, and sink, connected the president's and the first lady's rooms, staterooms B and C.\n\nThe bathroom also contained an escape hatch, which was added as a security measure during the car's refurbishing.\n\nInside the first lady's quarters was a bed and a dresser, although she didn't have an in-room bathroom.\n\nLocated towards the back of the car, Stateroom A, the second guest room aboard the Magellan, featured convertible berths, like the other guest room, that could also be used as a breakfast, gathering, or office space for the president or his guests.\n\nThe upper berth could be raised into the ceiling, and the lower one could be converted into a sitting booth with a pull-out table.\n\nThe Ferdinand Magellan functioned as a White House on wheels, and was often attached to train cars dedicated to Secret Service, White House staffers, and reporters traveling with the president.\n\nThe US Car No. 1 was also often accompanied by two communications cars equipped with control consoles for radio broadcasts and telegraph communications so the president could be reached while he was on the move, per Atlas Obscura.\n\nA slim, wood-paneled hallway led from the four staterooms to the observation deck at the rear of the car.\n\nThe observation room was also enlarged during the refurbishing of the car, allowing it to function as a secondary gathering room for the president and his guests.\n\nPart of the car's security modifications included the addition of escape hatches, like this submarine hatch on the observation lounge.\n\nIn 1992, Hurricane Andrew hit South Florida, and among its many damages were some sustained by the Magellan.\n\nAlthough minor, a small window crack shows how the presidential car has stood the test of time.\n\nAt the end of the presidential car was an exposed podium from where the president often addressed crowds.\n\nDuring Truman's whistle-stop tour, he spoke from the podium repeatedly, often addressing crowds in different cities within the same day.",

Since then, closures have outpaced openings. The company said that it now has about 6,000 US locations and plans to shutter 5% to 6% of those during the first half of 2026.\n\nThe coming closures follow a raft of several hundred closures last year of locations that the company said were technologically outdated.\n\nIn contrast to its domestic challenges, Wendy's international sales are growing, with systemwide sales up 8.1% and same-restaurant sales up 1.3% year over year.\n\nWall Street shrugged off Friday's earnings report, but Wendy's stock price is down about 8.5% so far in 2026 and nearly 50% compared to a year ago.",

    "description": "Trump's Department of Education emailed a group of student-loan borrowers who reached their payment threshold under income-driven repayment plans.",
    "fullText": "Some student-loan borrowers are getting an early Valentine's Day gift from the Department of Education.\n\nEarlier this week, another batch of borrowers who have completed at least 20 years of payments on an income-driven repayment plan received emails from the department with the subject line: \"You're eligible to have your student loan(s) discharged.\"\n\nThe email, which multiple borrowers shared with Business Insider, said that the department will \"work with your loan servicer to process your IDR discharge over the next several months.\" Borrowers do not need to take any action to receive the relief; however, those who wish to opt out of the relief have to contact their servicer by March 5 to specify that they do not want the discharge.\n\nBorrowers might choose to opt out of the relief to avoid state tax liability, the email said. Doing so would require them to continue paying back their loans.\n\nAfter the March opt-out date, the department will send borrowers' information to their servicers, and the servicer will notify the borrower once the relief has been processed. The email said that most borrowers will see the relief processed within two weeks, but it could take more time for some borrowers.\n\nThis student-loan forgiveness comes after the expiration of 2021 provision from the American Rescue Plan that made forgiveness tax-free. Borrowers who become eligible for relief after January 1, 2026, could be hit with thousands of dollars in taxes. However, the Department of Education previously said that it will consider the date a borrower reached their payment threshold as the date of the relief, so even if they were part of the latest batch of emails, if they completed their last payment in 2025, they should not face additional taxes.\n\nThe Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider on how borrowers can confirm their tax status on the latest loan forgiveness. However, the borrower's servicer would typically notify the borrower of the relief's effective date.\n\nThe student-loan industry overall is facing significant changes in the coming months. Beginning in July, the department will begin implementing its repayment overhaul, which President Donald Trump signed into law as part of his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation. It includes new income-driven repayment plans and borrowing caps for advanced degrees. Borrowers who enroll in the new plans would have longer timelines to forgiveness and could face higher monthly payments.\n\nThe department has maintained that its goal is to simplify repayment and ensure that borrowers do not take out student loans they cannot afford to repay.\n\n\"We have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a recent statement.\n\nHave a story to share?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kristan Vermeulen, the founder of Makers of the USA podcast and community. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI won the United States of America Pageants' Ms. Maine title in 2025. This was not a competition like \"Miss Congeniality.\" There was no pulling of hair between us. It's more about the camaraderie and understanding what these women are going through, and how we can all support each other.\n\nHere's what I learned during my tenure.\n\nHistorically, most pageant systems were restricted to unmarried women aged 18 to 28 with no children. Over the past five years, many systems across the US have expanded requirements to include more women. This shift isn't unique to my pageant organization, but a broader trend within the industry.\n\nAnother example: our pageant system was really positive when it came to physical attributes; we had a lot of women with tattoos. There was even a woman in my category who was in her mid-50s.\n\nIn my pageant, the interview portion accounted for most of my score. Pageantry offers a platform to pursue a new hobby or amplify an existing passion. Every contestant represents a platform or nonprofit.\n\nFollowing my divorce, I was in a period of self-discovery. Competing for and winning Ms. Maine while raising two children and navigating a new career path was a significant undertaking, but I wanted to show my children that their mother is powerful and capable of achieving anything — including winning a title at age 35 and walking across a stage in a bikini.\n\nI took it seriously. I even hired a walking coach in Brussels — I was getting up at 2 a.m. to practice while the kids were sleeping. I knew I wanted to win.\n\nThe pageant allowed me to amplify my maker brand. I have a podcast and storytelling platform called Makers of the USA, where I tell stories about American-made brands. I wanted to demonstrate how to shop local and support small brands in a big showcase. I had Maine-based Luxe by Dorcass and Angelrox make my gowns and patriotic wear bodysuit, for example. The former Mrs. United States of America reached out after my pageant and said she wanted to buy the gown I wore because it was so unique.\n\nThese relationships also helped me identify challenges within the maker community. I learned that Maine makers needed more visibility across all creative industries, which led me to work with my State Rep. to officially designate October as \"Maine Makers Month.\" We launched this past October with an event involving state reps, press, and the maker community.\n\nThere is a monetary prize, but the biggest thing I got from it was opportunities. I really took advantage of being Ms. Maine, even though I knew people might make fun of me. I'm currently discussing making my podcast into a television show, for example.\n\nWinning Ms. Maine helped my business. There has been a small negative, though. I'm a working professional, and I've decided to take my title off my professional online presence. People still have misconceptions about pageants, and that's not how I want to be perceived professionally.",

    "description": "Amazon, Microsoft, and Google raised capex plans to breathtaking new levels. That suggests knowledge that outsiders don't have, Bernard Golden writes.",
    "fullText": "Big tech earnings season was dominated by AI capex projections that stunned investors and hit the stocks of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, aka AMG.\n\nThis short-term drama makes it hard to think clearly about the long-term trajectory of AMG's businesses. To step back from the volatility, I use a framework called \"KGB\" that lays out three scenarios for the future of hyperscaler capex.\n\nI've worked in the tech industry for decades and written several books on cloud-computing and open-source software. I've had hands-on experience with major cloud projects at VMware and Capital One. Here's my suggestion for how to think about this unprecedented AI investment wave.\n\nIn this future, AMG are locked in an arms race, each spending aggressively to avoid falling behind. A more charitable version says executives believe failing to integrate AI is an existential threat, so they'll spend whatever it takes to avoid becoming the next digital Sears. Skeptics see this as reckless competition — burning cash for bragging rights, with tears and heavy losses inevitable.\n\nHere, AMG spending ends up \"just right\" to meet customer demand. These companies have unmatched visibility into future AI usage: real-time telemetry, signed long-term contracts, and ongoing enterprise negotiations. From this perspective, rising capex simply reflects confidence in durable demand and solid monetization.\n\nAs in Jaws, when the police chief finally sees the gigantic shark and mutters, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\" In this scenario, no matter how much AI capacity AMG builds, it gets absorbed immediately. The supply of chips, servers, power, and data centers remains the binding constraint, not demand. The problem isn't overspending; it's the inability to spend fast enough.\n\nRight now, the K and B camps are locked in a noisy brawl, while G adherents watch with bemusement. Part of the disagreement comes from how hard it is to grasp the scale of these businesses.\n\nAmazon's cloud business, AWS, is running at roughly $142 billion in annual revenue, growing 24%. That implies more than $34 billion in incremental revenue over the next year alone. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are second and third, but are still huge businesses, backed by the financial firepower of their money-printing parent companies.\n\nMost observers also fail to appreciate the enormous social and economic change underpinning this growth. The world is in the midst of a decades-long shift from analog to digital processes, which has plenty of future growth ahead of it. AI is just the latest addition to the trend, following the rise of the Internet, cloud computing, and enterprise software adoption. AMG are benefitting from a gigantic trend that will continue for years, if not decades. So maybe spending more than $600 billion on capex this year isn't foolhardy.\n\nThere's an obvious playbook to calm markets. In 2022, after pandemic-era overbuilding spooked investors, AMG executives promised financial discipline, made some cost tweaks, and watched their stocks recover spectacularly over the next two years. They could have done the same this quarter: keep a lid on capex, cite supply-chain constraints, and promise to revisit later. Their stocks likely would have popped on Goldilocks relief.\n\nObviously, AMG didn't do that. They ramped capex plans to breathtaking new levels. These companies are run by the same executives who lived through the 2022 drawdown. Their compensation is heavily equity-based, so they just took a big hit again. The fact that they chose to increase capex anyway should give observers pause. It suggests confidence based on knowledge that outsiders don't have.\n\nMaybe this really is the Jaws moment. Maybe demand is so strong, and visibility so clear, that AMG know the real risk isn't overspending. It's showing up to hunt the shark without a big enough boat.\n\nBernard Golden is CEO of Navica, a Silicon Valley-based technology analysis, consulting, and investment firm.",

    "fullText": "This interview is based on a conversation with Lyle Wallace, 45, a Dallas pastor. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI hit 6 feet 3 inches tall as a freshman in high school and weighed around 185 pounds.\n\nThen, while playing a lot of sports like football and basketball during my junior and senior years, I ate a lot of protein and built a ton of muscle, eventually reaching 230 pounds.\n\nIt was all good because I was running around doing all sorts of exercise, and my metabolism was fast. That all changed when I started Bible college in upstate New York, and my physical health became less of a priority.\n\nThe weight crept on. Then, when I entered the ministry, I found myself eating out a lot with the young members of the congregation. Sitting at a table together was a good way to bond and establish trust.\n\nThe only trouble was that we went to fast food places like Taco Bell or Mexican restaurants, where you fill up on chips and salsa before the main course arrives.\n\nThe job was stressful because I found it difficult to detach from other people's emotions as they dealt with bad stuff like domestic violence and sexual abuse.\n\nI turned to food as an outlet and became less healthy by the month. I had terrible digestive issues and bouts of diverticulitis. I had several colonoscopies and liver biopsies in my 20s and 30s and was found to have a fatty liver.\n\nThey should have been warning signs, but I ignored them and stayed sedentary. I'd sit in my office studying, writing sermons, and doing paperwork. My metabolism slowed down as I got older, but I didn't change my habits.\n\nI had problems with tendonitis, with symptoms mimicking a heart attack, pressure on my joints, and suffered excruciating pain from a bad back. I had spine surgery in 2019.\n\nMy wife, Nicole, would be on top of me about the causes, but I didn't face facts. It was only when I was diagnosed with diabetes in January 2023 that I became seriously worried.\n\nMy dad was diabetic and needed three or four insulin shots a day. I'm terrified of needles and didn't want to go down the same route. The scale registered over 285 pounds.\n\nI was prescribed Metformin, but not given any advice about improving my lifestyle. My blood sugar levels actually increased — one of my A1C tests showed 8.0 — and I despaired.\n\nStill, it was a wake-up call. My health insurance company encouraged me to \n\nIt collected my health information, including data from lab tests, a smart scale, a blood pressure cuff, and real-time glucose monitor sensors, and made personalized recommendations for nutrition, sleep, and exercise.\n\nThe app advised me what to eat and when. I learned that consuming protein and fiber on my plate before any carbohydrates helped my metabolism. Nicole and I scanned barcodes at the supermarket to assess the suitability of certain foods and prevent sugar spikes.\n\nI increased my physical activity by building up to walking four miles a day, without causing back pain. The other day, I ran after my 8-year-old daughter and her cousin and overtook them. They couldn't believe it.\n\nMy current weight is 215 pounds, 70 pounds lighter than before. I've gone from a 42-inch to a 36-inch waist and lost 2.5 inches off my collar size.\n\nBest of all, I've reversed my diabetes — reducing my A1C to 5.1 —and am medication-free. People in my congregation keep asking how I did it. I'm not a particularly high-tech guy, but AI worked wonders for me.",

    "fullText": "Prosecutors’ office says two museum workers, several tour guides and suspected mastermind among those detained\n\nFrench police investigating a suspected €10m (£8.7m) ticket fraud scheme at the Louvre museum in Paris have detained nine people, including two members of staff.\n\n“Based on the information available to the museum, we suspect the existence of a network organising large-scale fraud,” a museum spokesperson told Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe Louvre, the world’s most visited museum, reported the suspected scam to police which led to the arrests.\n\nTwo Louvre employees, several tour guides and one person suspected of being the mastermind were among those being held, according to the Paris prosecutors’ office.\n\nThe alleged ticket scam is the latest crisis to hit the Louvre. The museum is still reeling from a heist on 19 October, when a gang raided the museum during daylight hours, breaking in through a window and stealing an estimated €88m of French crown jewels in seven minutes, before fleeing on scooters. Four men have been arrested and are under formal investigation, but the jewels have not been recovered.\n\nOn Friday, the Denon gallery, where the museum’s most valuable paintings are displayed, was partly closed after a water leak, union representatives told news agencies. The Mona Lisa, the world’s most famous portrait, was not affected. The leak happened in room 707, where paintings by the French artist Charles Meynier and the Italian Renaissance artist Bernardino Luini are displayed. It was the second significant leak in less than three months.\n\nThe Louvre said it was facing a rise in ticketing fraud of different types. In response it had put in place a “structured” anti-fraud plan in cooperation with staff and the police.\n\nLe Parisien reported that the suspected fraud involved tour guides who had targeted groups of Chinese visitors. The guides allegedly brought in visitors by reusing the same tickets several times for different people. Investigators are working to establish whether the network may have brought in up to 20 tour groups a day over the past decade.\n\nThe Paris prosecutors’ office said surveillance and wiretaps confirmed repeated ticket reuse and an apparent strategy of splitting up tour groups to avoid paying the required “speaking fee” imposed on guides, the Associated Press reported. The investigation also pointed to suspected accomplices within the Louvre, with guides allegedly paying them cash in exchange for avoiding ticket checks, it said.\n\nA formal judicial investigation was opened last June on charges including organised fraud, money laundering, corruption, aiding illegal entry in the country as part of an organised group, and the use of forged administrative documents.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that suspects are believed to have invested some of the money in real estate in France and Dubai. Authorities have seized more than €957,000 in cash, including €67,000 in foreign currency, as well as €486,000 from bank accounts.\n\nIn recent months trade unions at the Louvre have launched several days of strikes, demanding urgent renovations and staffing increases, and protesting against a rise in ticket prices for most non-EU visitors, including British, American and Chinese tourists.",

In teams\nwhere people both wrote and reviewed code, it never felt like “we should\nprobably program slower.”\n\nSo when more and more people tell me they no longer know what code is in their\nown codebase, I feel like something is very wrong here and it’s time to\nreflect.\n\nSoftware engineers often believe that if we make the bathtub\nbigger, overflow disappears. It doesn’t.\nOpenClaw right now has north of 2,500\npull requests open. That’s a big bathtub.\n\nAnyone who has worked with queues knows this: if input grows faster than\nthroughput, you have an accumulating failure. At that point, backpressure and\nload shedding are the only things that retain a system that can still operate.\n\nIf you have ever been in a Starbucks overwhelmed by mobile orders, you know the\nfeeling. The in-store experience breaks down. You no longer know how many\norders are ahead of you. There is no clear line, no reliable wait estimate, and\noften no real cancellation path unless you escalate and make noise.\n\nThat is what many AI-adjacent open source projects feel like right now. And\nincreasingly, that is what a lot of internal company projects feel like in\n“AI-first” engineering teams, and that’s not sustainable. You can’t triage, you\ncan’t review, and many of the PRs cannot be merged after a certain point because\nthey are too far out of date. And the creator might have lost the motivation to\nactually get it merged.\n\nThere is huge excitement about newfound delivery speed, but in private\nconversations, I keep hearing the same second sentence: people are also confused\nabout how to keep up with the pace they themselves created.\n\nHumanity has been here before. Many times over. We already talk about the\nLuddites a lot in the context of AI, but it’s interesting to see what led up to\nit. Mark Cartwright wrote a great article about the textile\nindustry\nin Britain during the industrial revolution. At its core was a simple idea:\nwhenever a bottleneck was removed, innovation happened downstream from that.\nWeaving sped up? Yarn became the constraint. Faster spinning? Fibre needed to be\nimproved to support the new speeds until finally the demand for cotton went up\nand that had to be automated too. We saw the same thing in shipping that led\nto modern automated ports and containerization.\n\nAs software engineers we have been here too. Assembly did not scale to larger\nengineering teams, and we had to invent higher level languages. A lot of what\nprogramming languages and software development frameworks did was allow us\nto write code faster and to scale to larger code bases. What it did not do up\nto this point was take away the core skill of engineering.\n\nWhile it’s definitely easier to write C than assembly, many of the core problems\nare the same. Memory latency still matters, physics are still our ultimate\nbottleneck, algorithmic complexity still makes or breaks software at scale.\n\nWhen one part of the pipeline becomes dramatically faster, you need to throttle\ninput. Pi is a great example of this. PRs are auto closed\nunless people are trusted. It takes OSS\nvacations. That’s one\noption: you just throttle the inflow. You push against your newfound powers\nuntil you can handle them.\n\nBut what if the speed continues to increase? What downstream of writing code do\nwe have to speed up? Sure, the pull request review clearly turns into the\nbottleneck. But it cannot really be automated. If the machine writes the code,\nthe machine better review the code at the same time. So what ultimately comes\nup for human review would already have passed the most critical possible review\nof the most capable machine. What else is in the way? If we continue with the\nfundamental belief that machines cannot be accountable, then humans need to be\nable to understand the output of the machine. And the machine will ship\nrelentlessly. Support tickets of customers will go straight to machines to\nimplement improvements and fixes, for other machines to review, for humans to\nrubber stamp in the morning.\n\nA lot of this sounds both unappealing and reminiscent of the textile industry.\nThe individual weaver no longer carried responsibility for a bad piece of cloth.\nIf it was bad, it became the responsibility of the factory as a whole and it was\njust replaced outright. As we’re entering the phase of single-use plastic\nsoftware, we might be moving the whole layer of responsibility elsewhere.\n\nBut to me it still feels different. Maybe that’s because my lowly brain can’t\ncomprehend the change we are going through, and future generations will just\nlaugh about our challenges. It feels different to me, because what I see taking\nplace in some Open Source projects, in some companies and teams feels deeply\nwrong and unsustainable. Even Steve Yegge himself now casts\ndoubts about the\nsustainability of the ever-increasing pace of code creation.\n\nSo what if we need to give in? What if we need to pave the way for this new\ntype of engineering to become the standard? What affordances will we have to\ncreate to make it work? I for one do not know. I’m looking at this with\nfascination and bewilderment and trying to make sense of it.\n\nBecause it is not the final bottleneck. We will find ways to take\nresponsibility for what we ship, because society will demand it. Non-sentient\nmachines will never be able to carry responsibility, and it looks like we will\nneed to deal with this problem before machines achieve this status.\nRegardless of how bizarre they appear to\nact already.\n\nI too am the bottleneck\nnow. But you know what?\nTwo years ago, I too was the bottleneck. I was the bottleneck all along. The\nmachine did not really change that. And for as long as I carry responsibilities\nand am accountable, this will remain true. If we manage to push accountability\nupwards, it might change, but so far, how that would happen is not clear.",

    "fullText": "The vice president’s trip adds fuel to regional fires.\n\nIf there is one characteristic that defines the erratic and incoherent “Donroe Doctrine” of President Trump, then it must be the principle that “might makes right” in international politics. The Trump administration has little need for international law. It is willfully and blatantly disregarded and, indeed, discarded. Instead, from Greenland to Gaza, from Venezuela to Iran, the “law of the jungle” reigns supreme.\n\nThe essence of the “Donroe Doctrine” can be observed in the administration’s approach to both war and peace. An example of the latter is what occurred earlier this week when Vice President JD Vance flew to the Caucasus in a bid to bolster American influence and pressure on Iran’s northern frontier, at a time when tension between Washington and Tehran has never been higher. Amid profound domestic crises in the US, it would seem prudent to avoid dragging America into such far-flung adventurism, in a part of the world that is virtually unknown to most Americans. Yet there was Vance, stoking tensions with a large regional power—Iran—and a massive atomic superpower—Russia—all while quietly sanctioning democratic decline and ethnic cleansing in the post-Soviet Caucasus.\n\nVance’s Caucasian itinerary consisted of two of the three South Caucasus states—Armenia and Azerbaijan. Georgia, once the favorite of American neocons, was conspicuously avoided. In 2008, its president, Mikheil Saakashvili, had bungled his way into a confrontation with Russia at the behest of the Bush administration. Facing a bear-like reaction from Moscow, Tbilisi was left in the lurch by Washington. While Georgia has since learned from this painful episode, Armenia’s Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan’s Ilham Aliyev have decided to try their luck at the “Saakashvili” approach, with ample encouragement from President Trump. It is at their own peril that they ignore the clear warnings from Russia and Iran against any American presence on their borders.\n\nVance arrived first in Armenia, flying into Yerevan from Milan on a rainy Monday afternoon. A major part of his visit was to reinforce American commitment to the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP). Hailed by the Trump administration as a “historic” project to bring peace to the region, the known details of this initiative indicate that it is more likely to bring war than peace. TRIPP involves Armenia effectively relinquishing control of its crucial southern border with Iran to a joint US-Armenia company (with the US holding a 74 percent stake) for a period of 49 to 99 years.\n\nNaturally, any plan to establish a long-term US or NATO presence on Iranian and Russian frontiers is bound to raise alarms in Moscow and Tehran. Yet in Yerevan Vance not only brushed aside such concerns but even pledged to export $9 billion in the sphere of civil nuclear cooperation, in remarks that raised more questions than answers in Armenia. Observers of the vice president’s press conference with Pashinyan were treated to a stream of empty platitudes of “peace,” even though only a declaration of intent has been signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Indeed, despite Pashinyan’s confident assertion that peace had been definitively established between Baku and Yerevan under President Trump, the fact remains that a formal peace agreement has never been inked between the parties. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan continues to advance territorial claims on Armenia.\n\nVance failed to utter a single peep about Pashinyan’s abuses in office. Despite being catapulted to power in 2018 on proclaimed promises of political reform, Pashinyan instead embarked on a course of de-democratization. Under his neoliberal administration, poverty and inequality have worsened and corruption has flourished. Freedom of speech has come under assault, leaving Armenia with one of the highest pre-trial detention rates in Europe. The democratic right of the Armenians of Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh) to self-determination—the cornerstone of Armenia’s 1988 Karabakh movement—was betrayed by the PM to the whims of an aggressive Azerbaijan. Even the Armenian Apostolic Church, the country’s foremost religious institution with roots extending back to the time of Christ, has not been spared Pashinyan’s wrath. Despite widespread public trust in the church, Pashinyan’s government has arrested an Armenian bishop and three Armenian archbishops, including the beloved Archbishop Mikael Ajapahyan. Samvel Karapetyan, a prominent supporter of the church, has also been arrested. Even the patriarch of the church—Catholicos Karekin II—has come under attack.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Vance was mum on the sorry state of Armenian democracy. Instead, he took a page from the playbook of Walter Duranty and openly endorsed Pashinyan, emphatically stressing the government’s commitment to “markets” and “prosperity.” “All too predictably, the allegedly devout, pious, believing Catholic US vice president whispered not a word of protest against Pashinyan’s jailing of clergy of the Armenian Apostolic Church,” noted James Carden, a former State Department adviser for the Obama administration. “Instead, these and other unjustly imprisoned will be sacrificed on the altar of TRIPP—none of which redounds to the interests of the Armenian or American people.” Even the most potentially redeeming element of Vance’s trip to Armenia—his visit to the Armenian Genocide monument at Tsitsernakaberd in Yerevan—was marred by controversy. Vance, who was accompanied only by his wife, Usha, and not by Pashinyan, laid flowers at the monument’s eternal flame and posted about it on Twitter/X, only to delete the post soon after, out of fear of offending NATO member Turkey.\n\nWhile in Baku, Vance met with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and inked a strategic partnership agreement with him. “For us, it’s a great honor to be a strategic partner to the most powerful country of the world—[the] United States of America,” Aliyev underscored in his press conference with Vance. The Azerbaijani president likewise boasted of “cooperation in defense sales” with the US, a remark likely to be viewed critically in Tehran, given fears of Israeli use of Azerbaijan as a potential “forward base” against northern Iran. For his part, Vance praised Aliyev, noting that “other than President Trump, the only leader in the world that has really good relations with both the Turks and the Israelis is President Aliyev.”\n\nAs in Yerevan, Vance sidestepped the “inconvenient” matter of Baku’s democracy deficit, alluding only to the atrocious state of affairs when referencing the fact that Aliyev’s wife, Mehriban, now absurdly serves as the country’s vice president. “Hopefully that doesn’t give the [US] second lady any ideas,” remarked Vance, in a joke censored by Azerbaijani state television. Nothing was mentioned about Azerbaijan’s pervasive problem with political prisoners and dissidents, such as Bahruz Samadov and Igbal Abilov, to say nothing of the 19 Armenian prisoners languishing in Baku’s jails, such as Ruben Vardanyan. Behind closed doors, Vance reportedly raised the issue of the latter group to Aliyev, but Aliyev’s response is unknown. The vice president did praise Azerbaijan’s army for having “some of the toughest and fiercest troops anywhere in the world,” although he failed to mention that this same army had ethnically cleansed the indigenous Christian Armenian population of Artsakh in September 2023.\n\nNaturally, the Vance visit failed to impress Moscow or Tehran and, by any objective measure, has only succeeded in antagonizing the two Eurasian giants. As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warns that US-Russian relations are “moving in the wrong direction,” the clouds of war continue to gather over Iran. Thus, rather than promoting “peace,” the Vance tour of the Caucasus will only add fuel to the fire of regional tension, signaling a continuation of the reckless interventionism that has come to define US foreign policy in the post–Cold War era.",

    "fullText": "In Apple TV's Silo, Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who gets wrapped up in an investigation involving the local sheriff (David Oyelowo)—usual procedural stuff, except that the characters all inhabit a massive silo, 144-levels deep, protecting the remaining 10,000 humans from the allegedly poisoned world above. It's an addictive show in spite of its smart, dystopian vibe and, it's been renewed through a concluding fourth season, doing one better than the three-book Hugh Howey novel series on which it's based.\n\nSeason three is expected sometime in 2026. In the meantime, you can catch these other shows that blend dystopian settings with existential mysteries. Stream Silo on Apple TV\n\nThough initially feeling like an unnecessary extension of Bong Joon Ho's allegorical post-apocalyptic film, Snowpiercer the show ultimately takes on a life of its own, a clever sci-fi melodrama that realizes that there are no heroes and few true villains at the end of the world, but mostly just people doing whatever they can to survive. In a frozen future (2026, to be precise), humanity survives on an extremely long train that circumnavigates the globe. If it stops, the power will go out and everyone (literally everyone) will die. Those who came aboard with wealth live near the front in relative luxury, while the poor live on scraps (or worse) in the tail. Daveed Diggs stars as former detective Andre Layton, a \"Tailie\" deputized by Jennifer Connelly's Melanie Cavill, engineer and the train's head of hospitality, to solve a series of murders. The inevitable uprising that follows sets the two of them on different sides of a violent conflict, as each comes to realize they're just pawns of elites—same as it ever was. Stream Snowpiercer on AMC+ or buy episodes from Prime Video.\n\nThe miniseries, based on the Emily St. John Mandel bestseller, was released at either the best time or the worst possible time: The story of the world 20 years after a devastating flu pandemic hit HBO square in the middle of COVID—and don't all of our current apocalypse dramas owe just a bit to that waking nightmare? The adaptation follows two tracks. In the past, Kirsten Raymonde is a young stage actor whose performance in a production of King Lear is cut short by the onset of a virus with a 99% fatality rate. We also visit Kirsten 20 years on, still an actor, but in a world very much changed. This one is a slow-burn, picking up steam only after a couple of episodes, but ultimately, it makes a moving case for the power of art, even (or especially) in moments when survival is on the line. Stream Station Eleven on HBO Max.\n\nThe tones here aren't a match, with Pluribus leaning toward dark comedy, but as post-apocalyptic mysteries go, you could do a lot worse than this sci-fi dystopia from Breaking Bad's Vince Gilligan. Well, I say dystopia, but the world of Pluribus is about as good as it gets for basically everyone but our main character. Rhea Seehorn plays Carol Sturka, a fantasy romance author and general grouch who becomes one of only 13 people on the planet immune to the \"Joining,\" an alien virus that transforms the rest of humanity into a peaceful, perky, and perpetually content hive mind. Carol refuses to surrender her miserableness in the face of a loss of identity, fighting instead to restore humanity to its admittedly cruddy ways. Thrilling, heartbreaking, and oddly funny, the show manages to address big questions about what it means to be human, and what we'd be willing to give up to change. Stream Pluribus on Apple TV+.\n\nDecades after a comet impact killed most of the Earth's population and left a barely breathable atmosphere, survivors in Seoul live in wildly segregated conditions. QR codes tattooed on hands determine your level of access to resources including air, as supplemental oxygen is a necessity for survival, to the point that cutting off the hand of someone with a better code than yours is seen as a viable means of moving up. It's all controlled by the mega-corporation that's building an underground refuge for survivors of its choosing, and that doles out oxygen via couriers who've taken on legendary status. One such deliveryman, known only as 5-8 (Kim Woo-bin), is also running an underground operation to help out the neediest of Seoul's population—which soon puts him at odds with the powers that be. Stream Black Knight on Netflix.\n\nWhile we're talking high-concept sci-fi, let's head off to Wayward Pines, from whence you will never leave. Based on a trilogy of Blake Crouch novels, this one stars Matt Dillon as a secret service agent investigating the disappearances of two fellow agents in the Idaho town of Wayward Pines. Things go awry pretty much immediately, and he wakes up from a car accident to find one of the agents (Carla Gugino), who's also his ex, having settled down in the seemingly idyllic community—and 12 years older than when he last saw her, only a few weeks ago. Even more dramatically, the local sheriff (Terrence Howard) enforces a strict \"no one ever leaves\" policy, on pain of having one's neck slit. As in Silo, the mysteries pile up from there. Stream Wayward Pines on Hulu.\n\nParadise reunites This is Us creator Dan Fogelman with one of that ensemble's stars, Sterling K. Brown, for something quite different. It looks more like a political thriller at the outset: We're apparently in an affluent suburban town in which everything looks fairly tidy. It's the home of Brown's Xavier Collins, a widower and secret service agent, which would be more impressive if the president he'd been serving (James Marsden) hadn't been murdered (much of the narrative is revealed in flashbacks). Oh, and that cute little town? Turns out that it's an underground bunker, fancier one than in Silo, but just as ominous. Stream Paradise on Hulu.\n\nLeave it to those melancholy Danes to center an apocalypse around precipitation. In this three-season import, a virus spread by rainfall that wipes out most of the population of Scandinavia. Siblings Simone and Rasmus emerge from their bunker six years later, setting off across the countryside with the hope of finding a safe haven, and maybe tracking down their father. It turns out that one of them holds the key to wiping out the virus and saving the world. It’s not the most original premise (The Last of Us game came out five years earlier), but the setting gives it a unique feel, and the series comes to a decisive ending. Stream The Rain on Netflix.\n\nThe War of the Worlds industrial complex is never far from churning out new adaptations, this being one of two competing series that started in 2019. There was a period-faithful BBC miniseries, and then this French co-production, serving as a much looser, modern-set adaptation. Gabriel Byrne and Elizabeth McGovern lead the cast as estranged couple Bill and Helen, among the few survivors of an alien pulse that leaves the world sparsely populated, and humanity under constant threat from the mysterious invaders who aren't done with us yet. It's as dark as they come, with traumatized individuals nursing secrets and making calculations as to whom they might be willing to sacrifice in order to survive our new overlords. Stream War of the Worlds on MGM+ or buy it from Prime Video.\n\nGoing from an underground dystopia to an outer-space dystopia only to find that things aren't all that different, save that the giant hunk of metal that contains the bulk of surviving humanity is horizontal and in space rather than vertical and underground. Humans will figure out how to take our problems with us anywhere, being the point. Here, the trigger is the monotheistic Cylons, an artificial intelligence once relegated to serve as a labor force and who evolve, rebel, and have a plan involving wiping out their former masters in twelve colony worlds. The relatively few survivors, all that remains of humanity, escape on the title ship accompanied by a handful of others. Politics follow them, with military commander Adama (Edward James Olmos) frequently at odds with Mary McDonnell's Laura Roslin, the education secretary promoted to president after the entire line of succession is wiped out. It's one of the smartest shows of the aughts, in spite of the silly name, treating the premise of the cheesy '70s original with deadly seriousness. Buy Battlestar Galactica from Prime Video.\n\nLate-stage capitalism encourages “work-life balance” while simultaneously making it impossible, and then makes us feel guilty about it. In Severance, biotechnology giant Lumon Industries has a solution: They split your consciousness between your life at work and your life outside of it. For our lead characters (among them, Adam Scott, Patricia Arquette, and Britt Lower) the work- and home-based consciousnesses grow apart to the point that they become entirely different people. The show blends the conventions of office-based dark comedies with movies like Brazil and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, diving into the dangers of modern American-style totalitarian capitalism while providing a reminder that technology often promises to improve our lives while only making them worse. Stream Severance on Apple TV+.\n\nAs in Silo, we're stuck with a large chunk of humanity being forced to live underground for reasons that aren't entirely legit. In the world of Fallout, adapted from the video games, the aesthetic of the 1950s hung on for a lot longer than it did in our own, so plot similarities give way, in part, to a unique sense of style. The background is a little complicated, but not belabored within the show itself: It's 2296 on an Earth devastated two centuries earlier by a nuclear war between the United States and China. Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) emerges from the underground fallout shelter where she's lived her entire life in order to find her father, kidnapped by raiders. The aboveground wasteland is dominated by warring factions, each of which considers the others cults and believes that they alone know the correct way forward for mankind. Amid this conflict, the landscape is also overrun by ghouls, gulpers, and other wild radiation monsters, and Lucy seems to be just about the only human with any lingering belief in humanity. Stream Fallout on Prime Video.\n\nNot to be confused with The Simpsons Movie, this is the other story about an entire town trapped under a giant dome. Adapted rather loosely from the Stephen King novel, the show finds an entire community cut off from the rest of the world—their own personal apocalypse. As resources begin to dwindle, social structures begin to collapse, and the squabbling residents need to figure out how to survive and, if they're ever to escape, to figure out why they've been trapped under this dang dome to begin with.

The Amazon-owned company aired an ad on Super Bowl Sunday for \"Search Party,\" its new feature that turns a neighborhood's collective Ring cameras into one network, with the goal of locating lost dogs. Viewers, however, saw this as a major privacy violation—it doesn't take much to imagine using this type of surveillance tech to locate people, not pets.\n\nThe backlash wasn't just isolated to the ad, however. The controversy reignited criticisms of the company's partnership with Flock Safety, a security company that sells security cameras that track vehicles, notably for license plate recognition. But the partnership with Ring wasn't about tracking vehicles: Instead, Flock Safety's role was to make it easier for law enforcement agencies that use Flock Safety software to request Ring camera footage from users. Agencies could put in a request to an area where a crime supposedly took place, and Ring users would be notified about the request. They didn't have to agree to share footage, however.\n\nLaw enforcement could already request footage from Ring users, through the platform's existing \"Community Requests\" feature. But this partnership would let agencies make these requests directly through Flock Safety's software. If a user submitted footage following a request, Ring said that data would be \"securely packaged\" by Flock Safety and share to the agency through FlockOS or Flock Nova.\n\nThat partnership is officially over. On Friday, Ring published a blog post announcing the end of its relationship with Flock Safety. The company said, after a review, the integration \"would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated.\" As such, both parties have agree to cancel the partnership.\n\nImportantly, Ring says that since the integration never actually launched, no user footage was ever sent to Flock Safety—despite the company announcing the partnership four months ago. Social media influencers had spread the false claim that Flock Safety was seeding Ring footage directly to law enforcement agencies, such as ICE. While those claims are inaccurate, they were likely fueled by reporting from 404 Media that ICE has been able to access Flock Safety's data in its investigations. Had Ring's partnership with Flock Safety gone ahead, there would be legitimate cause to believe that agencies like ICE could tap into the footage Ring users had shared—even if those users were under the impression they were only sharing footage with local agencies to solve specific cases.\n\nWhile privacy advocates will likely celebrate this news, the cancelled partnership has no effect on Community Requests. Law enforcement agencies will still be able to request footage from Ring users, and those users will still have a say in whether or not they send that footage. Ring sees the feature as an objective good, allowing users to voluntarily share footage that could help law enforcement solve important cases. In its announcement on Friday, Ring cited the December 2025 Brown University shooting, in which seven users shared 168 video clips with law enforcement. According to Ring, one of those videos assisted police in identifying the suspect's car, which, in turn, solved the case.",

    "title": "10 Hacks for Hanging Pictures Perfectly Every Time",
    "description": "It seems so easy and straightforward, but we all have crooked frames on our walls.",
    "fullText": "Who among us has not looked at a newly framed picture, then looked at their wall and thought, \"Eh, surely I can eye-ball it this time.\" Hanging pictures should be an easy feat, but so often they end up uncentered or slightly crooked, causing us to add more holes the wall than intended or desired. The next time you hang pictures or artwork in your home, use one of these 10 hacks so they're level and evenly spaced on the first try.\n\nA level is essential when hanging art—a frame that’s even slightly crooked will be an eyesore, and if you’re hanging multiple pieces in a group, it’s even more important that everything be level. If you forgot to grab your level, or you don’t have one, you can use a small ball, like a ping pong ball or a marble. Place it on top of the frame and adjust until the ball sits still, then mark it on the wall.\n\nIf your frame has two widely spaced hooks, knowing where to insert your nail, screw, or other fastener on the wall can be a mind-bending challenge. But if you have some painter’s tape on hand, it’s easy: Place a piece of tape across the back of the frame, with the top of the tape lined up with the top of the hooks. Mark the position of the hooks with a marker or pen, then remove the tape and place it on the wall at the desired height. Using a level, adjust the tape until it’s placed correctly. Then drive your nails right through the tape at the marked locations, remove the tape, and hang your picture. Here's a visual tutorial.\n\nAn alternative to the painter’s tape method is to use some toothpaste (or any gooey, sticky stuff that will wash off your wall easily). Mark the hooks on the back of the frame with a gob of toothpaste, check that it's level and at the desired height on your wall, then press the frame against the wall. The toothpaste will mark the precise spot where you need to drive your nails to hang the frame. Insert your fasteners, clean everything up, and hang that picture in the perfect spot. Here's a visual tutorial.\n\nIf you have spare cardboard (a cereal box will do) and a pin or thumbtack, you can make a little DIY tool that will make marking the spot for a hook or nail easy. Cut out a rectangle of cardboard, then cut a tab at the bottom that’s narrow enough to fit through the hook on the back of the frame. Slide the tab through, and push a pin or tack through from the back. Then push the picture into the wall at the right spot, and the pin will create a tiny hole where your hook or nail needs to be. Here's a visual tutorial.\n\nGot the nail in the wall, but can’t seem to catch the hook on the picture frame? Get a piece of string and loop it around the nail, then adjust so the ends are even. Take both ends together and run them through the hook, then pull the string tight as you bring the frame toward the wall. The string will guide the hook right onto the nail, no guesswork required. Here's a visual tutorial.\n\nIf your frame uses a wire across the back to catch a nail or hook in the wall, you know that sometimes you question your own perception of reality as you repeatedly fail to catch the hook on the wire. There’s an easy hack: Grab a fork from the kitchen and place it on the nail or hook in the wall so it leans outward. Then hook the wire onto the stem of the fork and slide the frame down, letting the fork guide the wire down. When it’s hooked, remove the fork and admire your work. (And wash the fork, probably.) Here's a visual tutorial.\n\nHanging art on drywall and dread all the mess and trouble of drilling or nailing? Skip it by using Monkey Hooks instead. These are self-drilling pieces of wire—you just poke them through the wall with a tiny bit of elbow grease—that spin around and provide strong, secure hooks that can hold up to 50 pounds of weight, all without a single tool. Here's a visual tutorial.\n\nIf you’re going to be hanging multiple frames on the wall, grab some paper and create a template first. You can use wrapping paper, butcher paper or any kind of paper you have lying around or can get your hands on cheap (you can also use cardboard if that’s what you have on hand). Lay your frames out on the paper and trace them carefully. Then use the toothpaste or cardboard/nail hacks described above to mark where the nails need to be placed. Hang the template on the wall (ensuring it’s level), hammer in your nails, remove the template, and hang your frames. Here's a visual tutorial.\n\nIf you’re going to drill or nail into your walls to hang pictures, you’re going to get a lot of annoying dust all over the place, unless you use a very simple hack: Tape an envelope to the wall underneath where you’ll be drilling. It will catch all that dust and save you the extra step of vacuuming afterward. If you don’t have any envelopes (or tape), some Post-it Notes will do in a pinch—just fold one in half and stick it to the wall under the spot where you’ll be drilling, and it will catch that dust. You can combine more than one Post-it if you need to. Here's a visual tutorial.\n\nIf all else fails, and you need to hang a framed picture but you are short on time or patience, there’s a simple solution: Lick the back of your finger, curl it over the hanging hook on the back of the frame, and place it against the wall at the desired height (typically around 57-60 inches from the floor). Your own saliva will leave a faint, temporary mark on the wall where you can confidently place your hook without fuss or delay.",

    "title": "Claude Has a Surprisingly Great Way to Add Multiple Appointments to Your Calendar at Once",
    "description": "Claude can turn any list of events—even a paper one—into an iCal file.",
    "fullText": "I rely heavily on my digital calendar—as far as I'm concerned, if something isn't there, it doesn't exist. It's annoying, then, when someone hands me a piece of paper or even an email stating when multiple meetings are going to happen. I need to either manually add everything to my calendar—which is time consuming—or try to keep track of everything separately from my calendar.\n\nI've found a better way, though. As of this week, even the free version of Claude can create files for you, including iCal ones. These files are handy for quickly adding multiple appointments to the Apple, Google, and Microsoft calendar services.\n\nFor example, say you wanted every Olympic men's hockey game on your calendar (I'm Canadian—what else was I going to use as a demonstration?) All you need to do is take a screenshot of the schedule, upload that screenshot to Claude, and ask for it to create an iCal download using the information. I tried this and it worked perfectly.\n\nThe Olympics thing is just an example, though. Say you're at a conference and the staff gives you a paper schedule—you could take a photo, ask Claude for the iCal file, and add everything to your calendar at once.\n\nNote that you might need to inform Claude about time zones. In my example, the screenshot I had mentioned what time zone the events were happening in, and Claude worked it out. In other tests, I found I needed to mention any potential time zone complications before asking for the file.\n\nUsing these files on a Mac is easy: just open it and the Calendar app will ask you which calendar you want to add the appointments to. But it's also not hard on Google Calendar or Outlook.\n\nOn Google Calendar, click the gear icon near the top-right corner, then click Settings and find the Import option in the left side bar. Click \"Select file from your computer\" and point it toward the file you downloaded from Claude.\n\nThe steps for Microsoft Outlook are similar. In Outlook, click File, then Open & Export, then Import/Export, then select Import and iCalendar (.ics) or vCalendar (.vcs). Select which calendar you want to add the appointments to and you're done—the appointments will all show up.",

    "fullText": "The 2027 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) will take place in June and July next year, the Confederation of African Football (Caf) president Patrice Motsepe has announced.\n\nThe South African said reports that the tournament, co-hosted by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, would be delayed or moved were \"totally unfounded\".\n\nDoubts have been raised over whether the necessary infrastructure in the three East African countries will be ready in time to stage the finals.\n\nMeanwhile Nicholas Musonye, the chair of Kenya's local organising committee, told AFP on Thursday that postponing the tournament until 2028 \"would be good for Kenya\" because the country will be gearing up for a general election in August 2027.\n\n\"The Afcon next year in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda is going to be enormously successful,\" Motsepe said.\n\n\"I am enormously confident. There are always challenges.\n\n\"We have to believe in ourselves as Africans and believe in our people. The quality of people we have who lead African football are world class.\"\n\nMotsepe was speaking at a news conference after a meeting of Caf's executive committee in Dar es Salaam on Friday, and an inspection of facilities and infrastructure in the three host nations by officials from the continent's governing body will run until Tuesday.\n\nCaf made a commitment to host Afcon mid-year from 2019 onwards, but the past three editions have been played in a January-February or December-January slot.\n\nStaging the tournament during the European club season has led to disputes over release dates for players, and Afcon will be held every four years - instead of biennially - from 2028.\n\nThe precise dates of the 2027 Afcon will be announced in due course, Motsepe added.\n\nThe Caf president did not give an update on bids to host the 2028 finals, but said he hoped to expand Afcon from 24 to 28 teams in the future.\n\nElsewhere, Motsepe says Caf \"still have an engagement\" with Morocco to host the 2026 Women's Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon), which is scheduled to kick off on 17 March.\n\nEarlier this month South Africa's deputy sports minister said her country would step in and stage the finals.\n\nHer comments were later clarified by South African sports minister Gayton McKenzie, who stated that Morocco \"remains the officially designated host\" of Wafcon 2026.\n\n\"Some other countries said 'Please can we host it?' but they want to change the date,\" Motsepe said.\n\n\"We can't change the date because it is a qualifier for the [2027] Women's World Cup.\"\n\n\"The Wafcon continues and it will be successful. It has to take place within that window.\"",

    "fullText": "The Scottish Premiership title race continues to deliver fascinating twists and turns, while the battles for European spots, top-six places and to pull clear of the bottom remain hugely compelling.\n\nHeart of Midlothian's late Edinburgh derby triumph on Tuesday, coupled with Rangers' draw in Motherwell, kept the Tynecastle side beyond touching distance of either Old Firm side.\n\nFalkirk have strengthened their grip on a top-six berth, while Livingston lost further ground on Kilmarnock and Dundee above them.\n\nHere are some of the key things to look out for on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nRangers out to apply pressure as Hearts aim to 'annoy'\n\nDocherty to assist as Aberdeen prepare for summer appointment\n\nO'Neill urges Celtic to buy Saracchi - gossip\n\nA last-gasp goal from Stephen Welsh, on loan to Motherwell from Celtic, denied Rangers the opportunity to unseat Hearts at the league summit when they head to Ibrox on Sunday.\n\nThe 1-1 draw at Fir Park leaves Danny Rohl's side five points adrift of the pace-setters from Gorgie.\n\nTime and again, Hearts' mettle has been questioned. And, at every turn, they have come up with the answers.\n\nHaving lost to St Mirren, they faced a Hibernian side thirsting to inflict more damage on their rivals' title bid but found their way to another derby winner in the dying embers.\n\nHearts continue to heap pressure upon the Glasgow two. They have beaten Rangers and Celtic at Tynecastle and in their respective strongholds at the other end of the M8.\n\nA draw would do for Derek McInnes and his team. However, Hearts know, and have shown, they have what it takes to prevail in Govan.\n\nRohl has resurrected a sinking ship at Ibrox and his January additions look well chosen.\n\nThis will be the sternest test yet of Rangers' championship credentials and, more pointedly, their capacity to handle the mental burden.\n\nCeltic signings have made a habit of fanfare this season.\n\nKelechi Iheanacho, Junior Adamu and, now, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have netted late winners on their debuts.\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain is the highest profile of the lot. The former England midfielder had not played a competitive match since his final outing for Besiktas in May before bending in a fabulous strike to sink Livingston in the 92nd minute on Wednesday.\n\nThe 32-year-old has clear pedigree. \"A very, very, very, very fine player,\" was interim manager Martin O'Neill's assessment.\n\nQuestions were asked about his readiness to contribute amid familiar ire about the Celtic board's transfer strategy.\n\nWhile Oxlade-Chamberlain can do little to address the latter gripe, he certainly calmed the former.\n\nWhat role, and for how long, O'Neill gives his new signing on Kilmarnock's artificial pitch remains to be seen, but his class and experience could yet prove pivotal at the pointy end of the campaign.\n\nJust two months ago, Dundee United dispatched Wilfried Nancy's Celtic at Tannadice to move within four points of fifth place. Things were looking up after an oscillating first half of the campaign.\n\nIn the seven league games since, Jim Goodwin's side have won a single match, against basement dwellers Livingston.\n\nIn fact, those victories against the champions and the bottom side are United's only triumphs since late October, a run of two wins in 15 matches.\n\nTheir assignment on Saturday is among the toughest in the top flight - a trip to high-flying Falkirk, who already look to have earned an unassailable foothold in the top six.\n\nCeltic, Hearts and St Mirren are the only teams to emerge with three points from the Falkirk Stadium this season.\n\nGoodwin and his players are in danger of being mired in a relegation fight, perched as they are five points clear of 11th-placed Kilmarnock, albeit with two games in hand.\n\nSt Mirren and Dundee are two points behind United having played a game more. Only the bottom two have conceded more goals.\n\nGoodwin did not mince his words after watching his team's late collapse to Hibs at Easter Road last Wednesday, a 2-1 lead dissolving into a 3-2 defeat in stoppage time, with both goals the product of balls into the box.\n\n\"Defensively pathetic at times,\" was the manager's verdict.\n\nWith the midweek visit of Aberdeen postponed, Goodwin has had a few more days to stew on that defeat.\n\nHe, and his charges, need a reaction.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal boss Renee Slegers says Olivia Smith's prowess as a central striker offers her side \"versatility\" as they aim to continue their strong 2026 when they visit Brighton on Sunday [BBC iPlayer, 14:30 GMT].\n\nThe 21-year-old was moved off the right wing and scored the only goal in last weekend's win over leaders Manchester City.\n\nShe stayed there for the Champions League tie at OH Leuven in midweek, again scoring and proving an able deputy for main striker Stina Blackstenius, absent with a calf injury.\n\n\"Liv stepped into that role and did really well - it gives us versatility,\" said Slegers. \"We can choose different things in different moments. That is one of the big strengths in our squad.\"\n\nSmith's versatility and 'contagious' positivity driving Arsenal\n\nSmith used her lightning speed to race past Manchester City defender Rebecca Knaak for the matchwinner at Emirates Stadium, before showing her positional awareness and timing of movement to produce a poacher's finish in the side's 4-0 Champions League win on Wednesday.\n\n\"We've seen a couple of things that are new to us [about Smith] and that is the beautiful part,\" Slegers said.\n\n\"She is obviously a very good dribbler but what she does really well in those central spaces is combining with Alessia [Russo] and Frida [Maanum] in the number 10 role behind, they have some great combinations.\n\n\"Her timing and movement is really good and she is such an explosive player so anything that drops in the box she is so quick to react.\"\n\nWith Blackstenius still sidelined, and Beth Mead unavailable with a hairline fracture to her shin, Smith is likely to be used in the central role once more when the Gunners head to the south coast this weekend.\n\nHosts Brighton ran out 4-2 winners at Broadfield Stadium in this fixture last season, though they come into the contest in poor form with four defeats from their past five league outings.\n\nConversely, Arsenal are aiming for a third WSL win in a row and are unbeaten in the league since October.\n\nWhen asked what she was expecting from the Seagulls this time round, Slegers said: \"They have had a challenging run but I think they are a good team. Last year away wasn't a good performance and we lost that game, so we know what they can do.\n\n\"They have an aggressive press but last time round when we played them away they did something completely different. We will see what their game plan is.\n\n\"As a team, we are in a better place than we were a year ago. That has all gone into our backpack so we know we have all of those experiences of how to deal with different moments as a team.\"\n\nWatch MOTD Live: Brighton & Hove Albion v Arsenal in the Women's Super League on Sunday 15 February, 14:30 GMT.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

That gap is definitely closing.\"\n\nScotland, who lost to West Indies in their first match before beating Italy in their second, initially missed out on qualification for this tournament.\n\nThey were added with two weeks' notice when Bangladesh opted to boycott and Wheal said the last-minute nature of their call-up has helped the players.\n\n\"It definitely takes the sort of nerves out of it because you're just sort of thrust into the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"But like I said, at the end of the day, the guys have been training hard.\n\n\"They know their skills and they back their talents.\n\n\"So regardless of the buildup and the prep we've had, over the last couple weeks, we've sort of come together as a squad and sort of accepted the situation for what it is.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Two storms with snow will take a swipe at parts of the northeastern United States this weekend, despite temperatures being significantly higher than recent weeks.\n\nThe first will be a sneaky storm forecast to move southeastward across the region from Ontario from Friday night to Saturday. This clipper-style storm will be associated with a push of cold air.\n\nClipper storms that move in this manner tend to produce blotchy areas of steady snow rather than an even strip. AccuWeather meteorologists have outlined a zone where up to a couple of inches or so of snow may fall during the first part of the weekend.\n\nThis potential for up to a couple of inches of snow will extend from around Lake Ontario in upstate New York to western Massachusetts, through the Hudson Valley of New York and into the New York City area, as well as the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and western Connecticut. Motorists in this zone are likely to have to deal with slippery travel. Airline passengers may have delays at the secondary hubs due to deicing operations.\n\nSurrounding this zone will be snow showers that reach from near the northern shores of Lake Erie to the Philadelphia metro area, potentially delivering a coating of snow.\n\nHave the app? Unlock AccuWeather Alerts™ with Premium+\n\nA pocket of dry, chilly air will follow this little storm from Saturday night to Sunday and may prevent a southern storm with drenching rain from moving very far to the north from later Sunday to Monday.\n\nHowever, that storm may reach far enough north to bring a mixture of snow and rain to portions of West Virginia, Maryland, northern Virginia, central and southeastern Pennsylvania, northern and central New Jersey and coastal areas of New York.\n\nHow far north the storm's snow reaches will depend on the exact track and how the storm interacts with the cold, dry air across the region. Where it does snow along the Interstate 95 corridor, treated roads could remain wet for much of the storm. Still, those with travel plans are encouraged to continue to check for updates.\n\nThis storm does not appear to be a repeat of the major winter storm that left deep snow and sleet across the Northeast in late January.\n\nSome overlap of the two snow areas will occur in part of the mid-Atlantic states.\n\nA separate patch of light snow and flurries will occur well to the north of the southern storm from late Sunday to early Monday. The St. Lawrence Valley, along with the Adirondacks and northern New England will be affected by this weak storm.\n\nBeyond Monday, a new surge of Pacific air will move into the Northeast with perhaps some of the highest temperatures of the year ahead.\n\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

    "fullText": "Packing down together in the Sale front row, Bevan Rodd and Ewan Ashman used to be on the same team.\n\nOn Saturday, at Murrayfield, they could still have been.\n\nIn April 2021, then-England coach Eddie Jones dispatched forwards coach Matt Proudfoot to Sale's training ground to talk to both players, as then uncapped, about their international ambitions.\n\nAshman - who started Scotland's opening Six Nations game in Rome but who misses the Calcutta Cup through injury - was born in Canada and raised in Manchester, but his father is from Edinburgh.\n\nRodd, born in Dunoon in western Scotland and raised on the Isle of Man, has English heritage on his father's side of the family.\n\nUnder rugby's rules, Rodd and Ashman could play for either England or Scotland.\n\nThey opted for different routes.\n\nSeven months after Proudfoot's visit, Ashman scored a try on his Scotland debut against Australia at Murrayfield. Six days later, also against the Wallabies, Rodd appeared for England for the first time.\n\nGiven the countries' shared border and history, hundreds of prospects face the same choice.\n\nEngland wing Tom Roebuck was born in Inverness. Henry Pollock, whose parents are both Scottish, used to support them instead of England as a child. Fin Smith, whose grandfather played for Scotland in the 1950s, could also have worn blue.\n\nCentre Fraser Dingwall, the son of a proud Scot, external, played for Scotland at age-grade level, before switching to England.\n\nScotland scrum-half Ben White, a serial Calcutta Cup try-scorer, went in the opposite direction. Born in Stoke, White captained England's Under-20s and even appeared in a non-Test fixture against the Barbarians.\n\nCentre Huw Jones moved to England as a toddler and stayed for the rest of his childhood. Full-back Tom Jordan has a Blackpool-born grandmother.\n\nThe battle to secure these dual-qualified talents continues right up until they are \"captured\" - via a senior or second-string appearance for a country - but it starts much earlier.\n\nSaturday, 14th February at 16:40 GMT\n\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app\n\nTwo weeks ago, 12 miles from Twickenham, Scotland parked coaches on very English lawns.\n\nIn the stately surroundings of RGS Surrey Hills school in Dorking, a group of Under-16 and Under-18 prospects ran through drills under the eyes of staff from Scottish Rugby's SQ (Scottish Qualified) programme.\n\nThe scheme is designed to establish connections with youngsters who, like Ashman, Rodd and many others, live and play outside of Scotland, but could one day represent its senior sides.\n\nThe SQ programme's coaches, which include English-born former Scotland international Peter Walton, act on tip-offs from schools and clubs.\n\nThey also set up a recruiting station at high-level age-grade rugby events, inviting those with the ancestry and interest to scan a QR code and enter their details.\n\nAll countries work to maximise their talent pool.\n\nEngland are keen to ensure that Under-20 Rugby World Cup winner Junior Kpoku, who plays for Toulon and could become available to France, will go on to wear white at senior level.\n\nSouth African-born centre Benhard Janse van Rensburg will soon be eligible for England on residence grounds after the Rugby Football Union successfully asked for a review of his tie to the Springboks.\n\nBut for nations with a smaller talent pool - Scotland has about 50,000 club players, compared to England's 880,000 - there is a higher premium on making sure a particular promising youngster chooses to represent them.\n\nWhat are the factors that come into a player's decision?\n\nFirst and foremost, there is national pride.\n\nAshman said that back in 2021, he explained \"quite bluntly\" to England's coaches that he wanted to play for Scotland.\n\nSometimes, however, players can be torn between different parts of their identity.\n\nFlanker Gary Graham, the son of former Scotland prop George Graham, grew up in Carlisle. He attended a training camp with England and, perhaps in an effort to wind up his father in a joint interview, told the Daily Mail in February 2018, external that he \"feels more English than Scottish\".\n\nWithin a year later, having not played for England, he made his debut for Scotland, assuring fans that he has \"always wanted to play for his country\".\n\nOther factors can sway players.\n\nEngland's best players can earn more than £150,000 a year for a season that involves around 12 Tests as part of their union's new central contract system.\n\nScotland's players get less. Their match fees are around £5,000 a Test, with bonuses dependent on the team's final standing in the Six Nations table and their own personal involvement in the campaign.\n\nPlayers might however make a calculated decision on which nation offers the surest path to the Test stage.\n\nScotland's smaller player numbers may be a disadvantage overall, but for individuals it translates to a shorter route to international contention and less chance of being churned out once you get there.\n\nDual-qualified wing Ruaridh McConnochie won two caps for England in 2019, but was quickly discarded from Eddie Jones' notoriously high-turnover set-up, leaving him in Test limbo.\n\nPicking Scotland, as he did after a three-year stand down period later in his career, may have meant more international opportunities.\n\nScotland officials make the alignment and communication between Gregor Townsend's senior side, national second-string and age-grade teams and the country's two professional outfits a selling point to prospects.\n\nPlayers' decisions at international level also have a knock-on effect on their club careers.\n\nBen Vellacott, who has represented Scotland though age-grade levels, turned down an invite to be part of Townsend's senior squad in 2018 and instead attended an England training camp.\n\n\"As much as I wanted to play for Scotland, I had to be careful I wasn't without a job.\" he told BBC Sport in 2021.\n\nVellacott was coming to the end of his contract with Gloucester and, with Prem rules requiring clubs to meet a quota of English-qualified players, playing for Scotland and becoming ineligible would have made him a less appealing signing for English clubs.\n\n\"You have got to be careful,\" Vellacott added.\n\n\"You can play once or twice for your country, struggle to pick up a contract and then slip down the pecking order.\"\n\nVellacott went on to move to Edinburgh and make his Scotland debut in the 2022 Six Nations.\n\nPilates pain and spotting space - how Ford stays in the fly-half fight at 32\n\nScotland change four for 'biggest game of season' with England\n\nCaptain Itoje returns to England XV to face Scotland\n\nConversely, sometimes English rugby's selection policies are more likely to drive talent towards Scotland.\n\nSteve Borthwick is restricted to picking players from English clubs. Townsend is free to pick whoever he likes, from wherever they play.\n\nScotland internationals do not have to pick between playing for their country versus broadening horizons and inflating bank balances abroad.\n\nWhite for instance, would not have been able to take up the chance to play with club Toulon in France and remain on England's pathway. Jones will join him next season on the Cote d'Azur and remain an integral part of Scotland's plans.\n\nFor younger prospects, education can be key, with Prem clubs' partnerships with prestigious schools and university courses luring players across the border and potentially into the English system.\n\nThe Scottish influence at Newcastle Red Bulls could be a development to watch.\n\nTownsend is working as a part-time consultant at the club, which was bought and lavishly backed by the energy drink giant last summer. His former Scotland team-mate Jonny Petrie is managing director and fellow Scot Neil McIlory is general manager.\n\nGavin Vaughan, Scotland's chief analyst and a long-time part of Townsend's back room, is reportedly joining the club, external as head of recruitment at the end of the Six Nations.\n\nAmong Newcastle's spate of recent signings are George Turner and Elliot Millar Mills, both part of Scotland's matchday 23 on Saturday.\n\nCould Newcastle be a friendly English outpost for Scottish-qualified talent?\n\nWith the residency period for players to qualify for a nation having been increased from three to five years in 2021, so-called \"project\" players are now a rare species.\n\nIt makes little sense to invest such time and money importing a player who might only become available for one Rugby World Cup cycle.\n\nInstead the cross-border fight for talent with immediate credentials is hotter than ever.\n\nListen: Sport's Strangest Crimes - Bloodgate\n\nListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcast",

    "title": "SAVE Act explained: Republicans' sweeping elections overhaul would impose strict new voting rules, potentially disenfranchising millions of voters",
    "description": "The bill was approved by the House of Representatives, but faces long odds of being passed by the Senate.",
    "fullText": "The SAVE Act, a bill that would dramatically overhaul elections nationwide and potentially disenfranchise millions of voters, was approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. The legislation, which President Trump has been urging Congress to pass for years, edged through the House in a near party-line vote, with all Republicans voting in favor and all but one Democrat voting against.\n\nThe legislation now moves to the Senate, where it faces a difficult path to becoming law. Democrats have vowed to block it from moving forward, and Republican leaders in the chamber have so far balked at calls to change the rules to get around a Democratic filibuster.\n\nRepublicans say the bill is needed to defend American democracy, often echoing Trump’s false claims about “stolen” elections.\n\n“It’s essential to maintaining our Constitutional republic and everybody in this country seems to understand and agree to that,” GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson said after Wednesday’s vote.\n\nDemocrats argue that the bill is purely designed to make it harder for voters, particularly those who tend to vote against Republicans, to cast their ballots.\n\n“The SAVE Act is not an election security bill — it is a voter suppression bill, full stop,” the Congressional Black Caucus, a group whose members are all Democrats, said in a statement this week.\n\nRight now, rules around voter registration, the types of ID people need to show when they go to the polls and things like mail-in voting vary dramatically from state to state. The SAVE Act, which is officially named the SAVE America Act, comes well short of Trump’s ambition to “nationalize” American elections, but it would impose strict new rules for the whole country. These are some of its most important provisions:\n\nProof of citizenship for voter registration: The SAVE Act would require anyone registering to vote anywhere in the U.S. to show “documentary proof of United States citizenship.” Under the provisions in the bill, things like a driver’s license, Real ID or Social Security number would not be enough. Prospective voters would need to provide a valid U.S. passport, military ID, tribal ID or a birth certificate.\n\nThese requirements would apply to new voters and to anyone who was reregistering, either because they moved to a new state or changed their name. It would create additional hurdles for women who take their partner’s name after getting married, who would need to provide extra documentation to explain why their current name doesn’t match what’s listed on their birth certificate or passport.\n\nOnly U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in most U.S. elections. States already require voters to certify, under the threat of legal penalties, that they are citizens when they register. States also audit their voter rolls regularly to purge the names of anyone who shouldn’t be listed. Though Trump and many Republicans have claimed that non-citizen voting is rampant in American elections, researchers have found a “shockingly small number” of actual documented incidents — far too few to impact the outcome of even small local elections.\n\nOnly eight states currently require documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration. Expanding these standards nationwide would prevent 21 million eligible voters from being able to vote, according to an estimate by the Brennan Center for Justice. Only half of all Americans have a passport. Millions more either don’t have or can’t readily access their birth certificates.\n\nNationwide voter ID: The SAVE Act would require all voters to present a valid photo ID when they cast their ballots. Though a majority of states have some sort of voter ID law in place already, most of those laws are far less stringent than the standard the SAVE Act would create. For example, a number of states accept non-photo IDs or have procedures that allow voters without ID to still cast their ballots. Only 10 states currently have the kind of strict voter ID laws in place that the SAVE Act would impose on the whole country.\n\nThough a strong majority of Americans support voter ID laws, many experts say the rules do little to prevent fraud and instead disenfranchise otherwise eligible voters. Like non-citizen voting, cases of voter impersonation are exceedingly rare. There have been just 34 documented cases of someone falsifying their identity at the polls out of the billions of individual votes cast in the U.S. over the past 40+ years, according to a database compiled by the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.\n\nResearch on how many people voter ID laws prevent from voting is mixed, but most studies have found that it does have at least some impact on turnout. Elderly voters and people of color are disproportionately likely to lack the kind of photo ID they’d need to cast their ballots under the standards the SAVE Act would create.\n\nNew limits on mail-in voting: The SAVE Act wouldn’t override state mail-in voting rules — or fulfill Trump’s wish to ban the practice altogether. But it would make voting by mail harder. That’s because the new proof of citizenship rules would also apply to voters who register to vote by mail. Anyone registering for an absentee ballot, with some limited exceptions, would still have to go in person to a local elections office to present their passport or birth certificate for their registration to be valid.\n\nOther provisions: The SAVE Act would also impose strict new requirements for how often and how thoroughly states would be required to audit their voter rolls for noncitizens, create criminal penalties for elections officials who allow someone who fails to show proof of citizenship to register, and give regular citizens the power to sue elections officials who they believe violated the provisions of the law.\n\nAt the moment, the prospects of the SAVE Act making it through the Senate seem dim. Republicans would need at least seven Democrats to vote in favor of the bill to overcome the filibuster, but the party is uniformly in opposition to the legislation — which their leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, has called “Jim Crow 2.0.”\n\nSome hard-line Republicans in the House tried to create pressure to pass the SAVE Act by attempting to have it added to the crucial funding bill that ended the brief partial government shutdown earlier this month, but that effort came up short. They have also been calling on the top Republican in the Senate, John Thune, to amend filibuster rules to allow the SAVE Act to pass with a simple majority. Thune would need the backing of almost every GOP senator to do that, which he is unlikely to get.\n\n“There aren’t anywhere close to the votes — not even close — to nuking the filibuster,” he said on Tuesday.\n\nThere’s no guarantee that the SAVE Act would pass even in a majority vote. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said on Tuesday that she opposes the bill, which she described as “federal overreach” into states’ power to run their own elections. Some other GOP senators, including Susan Collins of Maine and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have also expressed their misgivings about the legislation.",

    "fullText": "If Scotland come out fighting as Sione Tuipulotu did in his pre-match media conference before the Calcutta Cup meeting with England, the home side might just have a chance at Murrayfield on Saturday.\n\nThe captain is clearly still hurting after last weekend's nightmare start to the Six Nations in Rome, when Italy outsmarted Scotland at a sodden Stadio Olimpico to claim a deserved victory.\n\nThe 29-year-old is famously honest in his media interviews, avoiding the sort of platitudes that normally come spilling out of players and coaches when their backs are against the wall.\n\nOn Friday, the Glasgow Warriors centre pulled no punches on how tough a week it has been after Rome and how Scotland are now \"a desperate team\" as their Six Nations hopes dangle on the cliff edge.\n\nHe acknowledged there must be a reaction against England but also emphasised that Scotland still have belief and confidence in themselves despite a run of damaging results.\n\nTuipulotu had a stinging response - as he did in the autumn - to the media coverage he feels has been excessively critical of his team and their head coach Gregor Townsend.\n\nSaturday, 14 February at 16:40 GMT\n\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app\n\nThere is a lot of tension around the Scotland set-up at the moment, but if they are to turn this situation around, they need the fans - many of whom have become weary and sceptical - to come along with them.\n\n\"It's obviously a game that means a lot to the country, and one that we really lean into,\" Tuipulotu said.\n\n\"Ever since I arrived in Scotland, I know this is the biggest fixture of the year for everyone, for the supporters especially. So, it's a game that we need to go out there and show up ourselves, for our supporters mainly.\n\n\"That's my main message - although the last three or four games have been really tough for especially us, there's a lot of supporters that haven't quit on us.\n\n\"There's a lot of supporters that are going to be sitting in those stands, watching us play. So, they're the ones that we're going to go out there and do it for.\"\n\nScotland change four for 'biggest game of season' with England\n\n'England the perfect game for Scotland's salvation army'\n\nThe questions Townsend must answer before Calcutta Cup\n\nEngland arrive at Murrayfield with the wind at their backs. They are on a 12-game winning run and are starting to build the kind of aura that has been lacking in England sides in recent years.\n\nTuipulotu drew comparisons between his side's current predicament and that of England not so long ago.\n\nThe big results were not coming and Steve Borthwick's future as head coach was being questioned - although perhaps not to quite the extent that Townsend is being questioned now.\n\nThe hope is another Calcutta Cup victory - which would be a fifth in six years - can be the spark for a similar revival for Scotland but, in the here and now, only a win will prevent their Six Nations challenge being dead in the water after round two.\n\n\"We're playing for our championship on Saturday, there's no doubt about that,\" Tuipulotu said.\n\n\"You can't lose two games in a Six Nations and expect to be in contention at the back end. So, yeah, we're a desperate team at the moment, and I want to see that desperation in the players.\n\n\"Definitely on their run of form, they deserve to come in really confident, but Calcutta Cup matches are often a little bit different and it doesn't really matter what form any team are coming with.\n\n\"It's kind of like a derby match when you're playing club 'footy'. You wonder why those games are so tight if you look at the form coming into them, and it's because there's a lot on the line.\n\n\"I'm expecting to see an emotional England team and I'm also expecting to see an emotional Scotland team.\n\n\"I kind of feel lucky that it is a Calcutta Cup match because we won't lack any motivation and neither will they. And it makes for a great game.\"",

    "description": "Captain Caelan Doris says Ireland cannot afford \"passengers\" as they bid to put the pain of their France defeat to bed against Italy.",
    "fullText": "Ireland have won their past five home Six Nations games against Italy by at least 30 points and held the Azzurri scoreless in 2024, but few are expecting a cakewalk this weekend.\n\nItaly have travelled to Dublin with their chests puffed out after beating Scotland in Rome last week.\n\nIt was an impressive performance from Gonzalo Quesada's side in appalling conditions; they dominated Scotland at the set-piece and held firm in the closing stages to win 18-15.\n\nIn contrast, \"honesty\", \"nobody holding back\" and \"teething issues\" have been some of the soundbites emerging from a downbeat Irish camp after last week's return to Paris ended with their biggest Six Nations loss in 16 years.\n\nIreland's deeply disappointing first-half display against France irked head coach Andy Farrell.\n\nHe criticised his side's \"lack of intent\" and wielded the axe for Italy's visit to Dublin, with Josh van der Flier, Jacob Stockdale, Tommy O'Brien and Cian Prendergast all excluded having started last week.\n\nFarrell has since said Ireland had a clear-the-air squad meeting in which they tried to \"simplify things\" and \"understand what we stand for as a team\".\n\nFarrell asks players 'not to overthink' against Italy\n\n'Nobody held back' in Ireland's post-France review\n\nIreland make six changes for Italy game in Dublin\n\nFor Caelan Doris, that means the players - including Six Nations debutants Cormac Izuchukwu and Rob Baloucoune and uncapped lock Edwin Edogbo - taking \"full ownership\".\n\n\"It's an exciting team we've got [for Saturday],\" said Ireland captain Doris.\n\n\"There's obviously a few changes, so getting cohesion through the week has been important. The message to those guys [coming in] is to trust themselves.\n\n\"Same with all of us really off the back of a defeat like that; doubling down on what we're good at, doing things properly with intent, enjoying it and enjoying it from doing things properly with intent as well.\"\n\nHe added: \"Creating a feeling through how we show up with actions, and it can be infectious that. But also to the new guys it's making sure they own it and make it feel like it's properly theirs.\n\n\"You can't have any passengers tomorrow, so, yeah, full ownership from everyone.\"\n\nIreland were ruthlessly dismantled by France last week. Having seen his side dominated in the air, Farrell has responded by removing wingers Stockdale and O'Brien and elevating James Lowe and Baloucoune.\n\nThe hope is they will both help steer Ireland away from a lack of intent on Saturday.\n\nLowe, a British and Irish Lion who has been virtually ever-present for Farrell's Ireland, was dropped for Stockdale while in-form Ulsterman Baloucoune is back in a green jersey for the first time since November 2022.\n\nAnd while Nick Timoney is unfortunate not to start after his effective introduction off the bench in Paris, Izuchukwu - another of Baloucoune's Ulster team-mates - should add to Ireland's dynamism and ball-carrying threat in the back row.\n\nThere is excitement, too, over Edogbo's inclusion on the bench. The 6ft 5ins, 127kg lock's young career has been ravaged by injury, but his performances for Munster this season have been difficult to overlook.\n\nFor Doris, there is a switch back to open-side flanker, where Farrell has twice used him before against Italy. He scored two tries against the Azzurri while performing that role in a World Cup warm-up game in 2023 and again slotted in at seven for Ireland's 36-0 win two years ago.\n\nRegardless of where he plays, though, Doris just wants to see Ireland move past their Parisian pain and put in a statement performance before next week's trip to title contenders England.\n\n\"There's been several chats throughout the week,\" added the 27-year-old.\n\n\"The big thing has been about holding each other more accountable as a leadership group, as a wider group, all of us taking full ownership and driving things in the right direction.\n\n\"We've kind of spoken a little bit about last week being a reference point that we'll hopefully look back on from a place of improvement this week, but also going forward as well.\n\n\"There's a realisation that we do need to improve, but there is still belief in what we're doing, and just the need to do things properly.\"\n\nSaturday, 14 February, 14:10 GMT\n\nListen to full match commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra 2, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Sport website and app alongside live text commentary\n\nFor Italy, the opportunity to deliver one of the all-time Six Nations shocks beckons.\n\nBeyond beating Scotland last week, they weren't far off stunning Ireland last year, losing 22-17.\n\nThey arrive in Dublin with myriad threats.

    "fullText": "In 2021, Santa Barbara City College received a $20 million gift from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, the largest donation in school history\n\nJust weeks ago, the school's Board of Trustees issued a statement saying they were \"disappointed to learn\" that some of that gift was \"used without explicit authorization\"\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Santa Barbara City College Foundation CEO Bobbi Abram acknowledged the \"accounting process failure,\" but stressed that the money was used \"in the spirit of the donor’s intent\"\n\nA California community college was gifted $20 million from philanthropist MacKenzie Scott — but some of the money was used without proper authorization, according to officials.\n\nSanta Barbara City College Board of Trustees President Jonathan Abboud said in a statement late last month that the board was \"concerned\" by the \"unauthorized use\" of the 2021 donation from Scott, the largest in the school's 112-year history.\n\nIn a separate statement obtained by PEOPLE, the Santa Barbara City College Foundation said the donation \"effectively funded a large portion of\" their Promise Program, which provides tuition assistance, books and other supplies for local high school students.\n\nBobbi Abram, CEO of the SBCC Foundation, told SFGATE that about $10.5 million of the billionaire philanthropist's donation was used toward the program from 2021 to 2024.\n\nAbram said that the funds were used without approval from the foundation's board, Santa Barbara City College officials or the school's board of trustees, according to the outlet.\n\nNow, $13 million is left of Scott's original gift.\n\nAbboud went on to say that while the board of trustees were \"disappointed\" to learn what happened, they were \"nevertheless grateful to the SBCC Foundation’s current leadership and staff for identifying the past unauthorized activity and initiating a comprehensive review of the SBCC Foundation's past accounting practices and swiftly improving internal controls.\"\n\nThe school noted that its board of trustees had initiated its own investigation as the SBCC Foundation is a separate legal entity.\n\nMoving forward, Abboud said the SBCC Board \"will continue to work collaboratively with the SBCC Foundation to address this matter appropriately and ensure full transparency and accountability for the use of the gift funds.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment by PEOPLE, Abram said the foundation wants to stress that the funds were not \"misused.\"\n\n\"More than 1,800 local students are supported by the Promise each year.  This is a nationally recognized program which makes higher education accessible for local families,\" Abram said. \"Using some of the Scott gift funds for the Promise was not a 'misuse.' It was entirely consistent with the Foundation’s mission and in the spirit of the donor’s intent.\"\n\n\"What it was is an accounting process failure and a lack of transparency and authorization which we discovered in 2025 and now have corrected,\" Abram continued.\n\nSBCC's student newspaper The Channels and SFGATE reported that Abram took over as SBCC Foundation’s CEO in May 2024 and conducted an audit after finding inconsistencies in the accounting records early last year.\n\n“Because this misstatement happened on the fund level, it was outside the scope of [a previous] audit, and was the responsibility of previous management to report it to the auditors,” Abram told SFGATE.\n\nAbram said that the SBCC Foundation is working to keep a closer eye on its accounting moving forward to prevent situations such as these, according to the Santa Barbara Independent.\n\nScott has made many notable donations to educational institutions and other organizations around the country.\n\nIn 2020, according to a report from Rutgers University, she gave more than $560 million to 23 historically Black colleges and universities across the country.\n\nAnalyzing the immediate impact of Scott's donations, Rutgers researchers found that, \"on average, the median enrollment of new students was more than 300 students greater for HBCUs that received funding when compared to the median enrollment for those that did not receive funding.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nAccording to SFGATE, she also gave $38 million to the University of California, Merced just after gifting $50 million to California State University, East Bay. In 2025 alone, she gave more than $7.1 billion to nonprofit groups.\n\nScott, who is dedicated to giving away the majority of her fortune during her lifetime, currently has an estimated to have a net worth of nearly $40 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nIn the years since her divorce divorce from Jeff Bezos became official in 2019, resulting in an approximately $36 billion settlement, Scott has “transformed” philanthropy with her sizable, unrestricted donations, according to a three-year study published by the Center for Effective Philanthropy last year.",

    "fullText": "Red Bull's advantage at the front of the Formula 1 field is \"pretty scary,\" says Mercedes driver George Russell.\n\nThe Briton said that the performance shown by Red Bull this week in the first of two pre-season tests at Bahrain had been a \"reality check\" for their rivals.\n\n\"They're not just a small step ahead,\" the Briton said. \"You're talking in the order of half a second to a second in deployment over the course of a lap.\n\n\"It's pretty scary to see that difference. And Red Bull have always delivered a very good car over the past 15 years, even when they didn't have a great engine. So, yeah, this test has been really eye-opening for a lot of us.\"\n\nF1 is introducing its biggest rule change in history this season, with the engines, chassis, tyres and fuel all to a new specification.\n\nEnergy management has become a much more central part of the sport as a consequence of engines that have about half their total power output produced by the electrical part of the engine, and a limited battery size.\n\nRivals say GPS traces of the Red Bull power-unit in Bahrain this week have shown that it can keep deploying its electrical energy for longer than any rival.\n\nThis is all the more impressive because Red Bull have set up their own engine company from scratch for the new rules, and gone into partnership with Ford.\n\nRussell said he and his team had noticed Red Bull's strength from the time they started running at the 'shakedown' test in Spain last month.\n\nHe said: \"The truth is, Red Bull in Barcelona day one hit the ground running and were well ahead of all of their competitors - ourselves, Ferrari and the others.\n\n\"Day one here in Bahrain again, they sort of knocked it out of the park. At the moment, they're very much the team to beat.\n\n\"When you get to Melbourne and you've got three hours of practice before qualifying, based on what we've seen in Barcelona and Bahrain, Red Bull are going to be ahead.\"\n\nRed Bull technical director Pierre Wache rejected Mercedes' claims, which were first voiced by team principal Toto Wolff on Wednesday.\n\n\"We are not the benchmark, for sure,\" Wache said. \"We see clearly the top three teams. Ferrari, Mercedes and McLaren are in front of us, outside, from our analysis, and we are behind.\"\n\nFerrari's Charles Leclerc said he believed Mercedes were \"hiding a lot more\" of their potential and that Red Bull and Mercedes were the fastest times, followed by his own.\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nThe second day of testing on Thursday was marked by two of last year's title contenders, Lando Norris and Max Verstappen, disagreeing over whether the new cars were enjoyable to drive.\n\nRussell said the 2026 cars were \"way nicer to drive\" in terms of their handling and ride compared with last year's, but added that the \"engines are very complicated\".\n\nHe said: \"These two tracks, Barcelona and Bahrain, are arguably two of the easiest circuits for the engines. I don't want to say anything too early before we get to the likes of Melbourne or Jeddah, but it will be much more challenging for the engines and the energy once we get there.\"\n\nBut he did expand on a point Verstappen made about the new engines demanding unusual driving styles.\n\nThese include using much lower gears in corners than would be normal, just to ensure the engine is revving highly so the systems can recover as much energy as possible.\n\nRussell said: \"To give an example, here in Bahrain, usually the first corner is a third-gear corner in the previous generation (of car). Now, we're having to use first gear to keep the engine, the revs very high to keep the turbo spinning.\n\n\"This is probably the one thing that is quite annoying and isn't that intuitive.\n\n\"Imagine when you drive to the supermarket in your car and you get to the roundabout and you put it in third gear to drive around the roundabout, but suddenly the person next to you says, 'put it in first gear'.\n\n\"Everything is like, 'Wwaahh,' revving. You don't go in the roundabout to the supermarket in first gear if you're driving at a sensible speed. This is the same thing.\n\n\"The car and the engine is designed to go around this corner in third gear, but because of the turbo and the boost and all of this, you've got to keep the engine revs very high, which means you have to take first gear.\n\n\"So, the car just isn't really designed to do that, but we're working around it.\"\n\nHe added that because of the critical nature of energy levels for lap time, it was not always the case that driving around a corner in the fastest possible way - which is usually the fundamental part of a racing driver's job - would lead to the best lap time.\n\nRussell said: \"In the past, if you went around the corner quicker or you tried something different and it worked, you know that's positive and you just carry that forward.\n\n\"Here, you almost need to wait a full lap to actually learn, 'What I did at Turn One, has that cost me energy or not?'\"\n\nAston Martin 'look four seconds off top teams'\n\nF1 2026 cars in pictures at Bahrain testing\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nRussell 'wants to go head-to-head' with Verstappen\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?",

    "description": "A federal judge in Minneapolis on Friday ordered the dismissal of felony assault charges against two Venezuelan men, including one shot in the leg by a immigration officer, after new evidence emerged ...",
    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal judge in Minneapolis on Friday ordered the dismissal of felony assault charges against two Venezuelan men, including one shot in the leg by a immigration officer, after new evidence emerged undercutting the government’s version of events.\n\nIn a highly unusual motion to dismiss filed late Thursday, U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota Daniel N. Rosen said “newly discovered evidence” in the criminal case against Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis “is materially inconsistent with the allegations against them” made in a criminal complaint and at a court hearing last month.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Paul A. Magnuson dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning the charges against the two men cannot be resubmitted.\n\nThe dismissal follows a string of high-profile shootings involving federal immigration agents where eyewitness statements and video evidence have called into question claims made to justify using deadly force. Dozens of felony cases against protesters accused of assaulting or impeding federal officers have also crumbled.\n\nA lawyer for Aljorna and Sosa-Celis said Friday that they and their families are “overjoyed” that all the charges have been dismissed. Had they been convicted, the two immigrants would have faced years in federal prison.\n\n“The charges against them were based on lies by an ICE agent who recklessly shot into their home through a closed door,” said Brian D. Clark, a lawyer for the two men. “They are so happy justice is being served by the government’s request to dismiss all charges with prejudice.”\n\nAn FBI investigator said in an affidavit that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Aljorna on Jan. 14. He crashed the vehicle and fled on foot toward an apartment complex. An immigration officer chased Aljorna who — according to the government — violently resisted arrest.\n\nAs the officer and Aljorna struggled on the ground, Sosa-Celis and another man came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, according to the complaint. The officer, who was not named in court filings, fired his handgun, striking Sosa-Celis in the upper right thigh. The men fled into a nearby apartment, and were arrested.\n\nA request for comment from the U.S. Attorney for Minnesota received an automated response Friday saying the office no longer has a public information officer. There has been a wave of staff departures from the federal prosecutor's office since the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge, a concentrated immigration enforcement effort targeting the Twin Cities. The Justice Department in Washington has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe day after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, accusing the Democrats of “encouraging impeding and assault against our law enforcement which is a federal crime, a felony.”\n\n“What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,\" Noem said in a Jan. 15 statement. “Our officer was ambushed and attacked by three individuals who beat him with snow shovels and the handles of brooms. Fearing for his life, the officer fired a defensive shot.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has not responded to requests for comment Friday asking whether Noem stands by those statements. The department also did not respond to questions about whether there was any investigation into the shooting or whether the ICE officer would face disciplinary action.\n\nClark, the lawyer for Aljorna and Sosa-Celis, called Friday for the identify of the ICE agent to be made public and that he \"be charged for his crime.”\n\nRosen's motion seeking to drop the charges did not detail what new evidence had emerged or what falsehoods had been in the government's prior filings, but cracks began to appear in the government's case during a Jan. 21 court hearing to determine whether the accused men could be released pending trial.\n\nIn court, the ICE officer's account of the moments before the shooting differed significantly from testimony from the two defendants and three eyewitnesses. The ICE officer’s account that he was assaulted with a broom and snow shovel was also not corroborated by available video evidence.\n\nAljorna and Sosa-Celis denied assaulting the agent with a broom or a snow shovel. Neither video evidence nor testimony from a neighbor and the men’s romantic partners supported the agent’s account that he had been attacked with a broom or shovel or that a third person was involved.\n\nFrederick Goetz, a lawyer representing Aljorna, said his client had a broomstick in his hand and threw it at the agent as he ran toward the house. Attorney Robin Wolpert, representing Sosa-Celis, said he had been holding a shovel but was retreating into the home when the officer fired, wounding him. The men’s attorneys said the prosecution’s case relied wholly on testimony from the agent who fired the gun.\n\nNeither Aljorna and Sosa-Celis had violent criminal records. Both had been working as DoorDash delivery drivers at night in an attempt to avoid encounters with federal agents, their attorneys said.\n\nAljorna and Sosa-Celis retreated into a nearby home and they barricaded the door to prevent federal agents from entering, according to the FBI agent. Federal officers used tear gas to try to force the men out of their home, he added. Out of concern for the safety of two children inside the home — both under the age of 2 — Aljorna and Sosa-Celis turned themselves over to authorities.\n\nBiesecker reported from Washington.",

    "fullText": "The Scottish rugby mentality is a complex thing. Not everybody gets it. It addles the brain. Fries the senses. Approach with caution - if you must approach at all.\n\nScotland's relationship with England, and how England perceives that relationship, has layers to it. Head coach Gregor Townsend said the other day that the Calcutta Cup is his team's biggest game of the year, which it is. Captain Sione Tuipulotu chimed with that view on Friday.\n\nThe biggest game, but in recent times, not the biggest barometer. This whole picture changed when Townsend took over. His record of four Calcutta Cup wins in a row and five wins in eight - a missed Finn Russell conversion away last season from six in eight - is sensational.\n\nIn his newspaper column, external during the week Courtney Lawes, the great England forward of recent vintage, said of Scotland that he would get annoyed if he felt he was going up against a team \"that only plays well because it's England\".\n\nIt was an interesting take on how England view the Scottish resurgence in this fixture. \"I have never understood Scotland's mentality that a bad season can be saved by winning the Calcutta Cup,\" Lawes said.\n\nCertainly in the past, and probably recent past, that was the case. It's not the case anymore. If Scotland were to beat only England in the Six Nations it would be considered an appalling season, not one that was saved by overcoming the Auld Enemy. One win from five - a Calcutta Cup - would put Townsend on the brink of losing his job.\n\nLawes added: \"If Scotland played every week like they do against England they would actually have a really good chance of winning the competition.\n\n\"It strikes me as being a major weakness in the Scottish psyche. It holds them back. No wonder they never win anything.\"\n\nWe're a desperate team - Scotland captain Tuipulotu\n\nScotland change four for 'biggest game of season' with England\n\n'England the perfect game for Scotland's salvation army'\n\nIt's tremendous knockabout stuff, but it rather overestimates the scale of the challenge Scotland have faced when playing against England in the Townsend era. Frankly, England haven't been all that good. They've been far from the acid test of Scotland's true worth.\n\nAll of these Scotland victories - were they because the Scots raised their game or because England were disorganised defensively, weak mentally and relatively easy prey to some brilliance in Townsend's backline?\n\nScotland haven't won anything, Lawes is correct. England are not exactly dripping with silverware themselves. They have won one Six Nations in that time. They have finished fifth in the table more often than they've finished first.\n\nFrance, Ireland and Wales have all won Grand Slams during that period from 2017 since Townsend stepped up. England, for all their resources, haven't won a Slam in a decade and have won only two in the history of the Six Nations.\n\nIn the past eight Six Nations they've finished first once, second twice, third twice, fourth once and fifth twice. Beating England has not been akin to climbing Everest.\n\nMaybe it's not about Scotland supposedly playing above themselves, as Lawes and others would argue. Maybe it's been more about England not being good enough.\n\nThe fear for Scotland is that head coach Steve Borthwick has now cracked it. Twelve wins in a row, a well drilled team in all departments, excellent leaders, a mighty bench - all the impressions are that the foundations are solid, that the team is less susceptible to the kind of chaos that Scotland will want to inflict on them on Saturday.\n\nMurrayfield should be a huge examination of their new found mettle, though. Tuipulotu shone a bright spotlight on what he calls Scotland's \"desperation\" ahead of the Calcutta Cup.\n\nSaturday, 14 February at 16:40 GMT\n\nLive commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app\n\nThe Scotland players and coaches have been pulverised this past week. It wasn't the fact that they lost to Italy that caused such fury, it was the manner of it, the soft-touch defending, the dysfunctional set-piece, the wasted opportunities in attack.\n\nZero line-breaks is a stat that will stick in the throat until the rugby equivalent of the Heimlich manoeuvre is performed on this Scotland team. That comes in the form of victories. Saturday would be an opportune time to begin. Or else, for their championship, it really is the end.\n\nTuipulotu's words suggested there's a serious reaction coming at Murrayfield but one of the issues for Scotland is the absence of the X-factor that has won so many of these days before.\n\nIn 2024, it was Scotland's ability to get it to the wide channels early that was decisive. Blair Kinghorn was inventive and classy. A Duhan van der Merwe hat-trick ensued. No Duhan this time. No Kinghorn.\n\nThe year before it was more Duhan - a solo score from the other end of the world and another at the end that clinched it. The year before that it was Darcy Graham who created one for Ben White and was heavily involved in winning a penalty try in the air off Luke Cowan-Dickie that changed the game. Graham is on the bench, but not in great form.\n\nIn 2021, Van der Merwe blasted over for the winning score. Seven tries against England. If the whole thing about Scotland raising their game just for England is overblown, that's emphatically not the case when it comes to the big wing. He saves his best for England. He has become the totem of this game, but he's 24th man on Saturday.\n\nThe reality of Van der Merwe is that he's not been himself for close to a year. There is a feeling that England would have loved it had Van der Merwe been selected so that George Ford and Alex Mitchell could pepper him with contestables. The air, and defensive positioning, are not his strong suits.\n\nIn the selection of his back three, Townsend erred on the side of caution and form. You can see why, but a gambler would have gone with Van der Merwe in the hope that Scotland can create the kind of unstructured mayhem that could see him reborn. A big risk, sure. But the allure of that potential reward…\n\nThe same with Kinghorn, a pedigree athlete, who's not at his best right now. So many of Scotland's moments of magic in the winning run against England have heavily involved players who are not starting or not in the 23. The absence of the unpredictable places more of an onus on Finn Russell to produce a masterclass.\n\nWith the machine that is Bath, Russell is playing a tighter game this season than at any other time in his career. His forwards are magnificent and Bath use them effectively. They have aerial threats and that's a big part of their game, too. They can play any which way, but the expansive stuff hasn't been the dominant style. He might want to cut loose on that on Saturday.\n\nWill Scotland win an arm wrestle? Possible, but unlikely. Their best route is to play what is instinctive to them. Not caution to the wind, but ambition and daring and breakneck speed.\n\nEven allowing for no Van der Merwe and no Kinghorn, this team can play. It's mostly Glasgow in Scotland colours. England will respect them. In the autumn, a similar version of this side ran in 17 unanswered points against the All Blacks and 21 unanswered points against Argentina. They lost both games, of course.\n\nThis side has a split personality. Which side of their character will we see most on Saturday? There's no telling. Jekyll and Hyde is Steady Eddie by comparison.\n\nThere's a reaction coming, you can almost bank on that. How far it takes them against a streetwise England is the great unknown.\n\nAuld enemy, new talent - Scotland & England's scrap for tomorrow's stars\n\nSix Nations: In Edinburgh with Itoje & Gregor's gamble\n\n'Deeply emotional & very sad' - Itoje on mother's funeral and England return",

    "fullText": "The seal, which is made of a light brown gemstone, is thought by archaeologists to have been “hung like a necklace around its owner’s neck,” and decoratively divided into three.\n\nA stone seal believed to have been used by a high-ranking administrative official during the time of the Kingdom of Judah in the late 8th century BC was discovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) during excavations in northern Israel.\n\nThe dig was led by archaeologists Dr. Amir Gorzalczany and Gerald Finklestein. The IAA shared the find in a Wednesday post to social media, adding that the excavations had taken place as part of the construction of the Ein Tut Interchange.\n\nThe seal, made of a light brown gemstone, is thought by archaeologists to have been “hung like a necklace around its owner’s neck” and is decoratively divided into three parts.\n\nFour pomegranates are carved into the upper section of the seal, while the other two sections contain an ancient Hebrew inscription reading: “Belonging to Makhach (son of) Amihai,” the IAA explained.\n\n“The importance of the seal derives both from its contribution to the treasury of biblical names, and from the fact that, unlike most seals of its type, this seal's origin is from an organized archaeological excavation and not from antiquities collectors,” the late archaeologist David Amit had said of the discovery.\n\nAmit deciphered the inscription alongside Dr. Esther Eshel of Bar-Ilan University.\n\nPieces of jar handles bearing royal seals were also found at the site, impressed with the words “Belonging to the King” and the names of Hebron and the ancient city Ziph, two important administrative cities at the end of the First Temple period.\n\n\"Such seal impressions are a common find at biblical sites in the Judah region,” Gorzalczany said of the findings. “However, their presence at a site so northern, deep within the territories of the biblical Kingdom of Israel, is most surprising.”",

    "fullText": "Forecasts are warning about a series of upcoming winter storms that are predicted to bring extremely powerful weather conditions to a region of the United States. The area is expected to face hurricane-force winds and heavy snow accumulation that will build up over several days.\n\nOn February 12, 2026, Newsweek reported that a series of winter storms could \"dump up to 10 feet of snow\" in the high-elevation terrain in the Sierra Nevada. Models show the potential for a total of 120 inches (10 feet) falling in that area of California and Nevada over a period of one or two weeks starting on Monday, February 16. Amounts will vary significantly by location and elevation, with lower but still highly significant figures more likely in some areas.\n\nThere aren't any major cities in the direct path of this series of storms. However, several populated ski towns are expected to see extreme levels of snowfall over the span of the systems.\n\nSki Towns in the Sierra Nevada Likely to See Heavy Snow:\n\nMount Rose – Ski Tahoe (near Reno, NV)\n\nDiamond Peak (Incline Village, NV)\n\nThose towns are home to thousands of residents combined, and they draw a great deal of tourism. For example, the website for Mammoth Lakes, California, states that it receives 2.8 million tourists annually, 1.3 million of which arrive in the winter season. Once these weather conditions pass, there will be lots of snow in these towns, which will be perfect for tourists. Men's Journal's gear editor, Adam Bible, put together a guide of the best ski and snowboard gear that has valuable information for anyone who wants to hit the slopes in California or anywhere else.\n\nA February 11, 2026, San Francisco Chronicle article detailed forecasts that call for extremely powerful wind gusts in the Sierra Nevada. Starting on Monday, February 16, and lasting until the following day, the region of California will be struck by 65 - 80 mph wind gusts.\n\nOn the National Weather Service's website for the National Hurricane Center, it describes how destructive wind gusts that reach up to 80 mph can be. That article shows that those gusts are deemed to be category 1 hurricane-force winds and it provides a breakdown of the effects they can have.\n\n\"Very dangerous winds will produce some damage: Well-constructed frame homes could have damage to their roof, shingles, vinyl siding, and gutters. Large branches of trees will snap, and shallowly rooted trees may be toppled. Extensive damage to power lines and poles likely will result in power outages that could last a few to several days.”",

    "title": "Scientists Thought They Found a Dead Snake. It Turned Out to Be a New Species",
    "description": "A simple walk down an Indian village resulted in a first-of-its-kind discovery.",
    "fullText": "Production of this article included the use of AI. It was reviewed and edited by a team of content specialists.\n\nSometimes the most amazing scientific discoveries happen when you least expect them—not in a high-tech laboratory, but on a simple walk near a village.\n\nThat’s exactly what happened to two scientists in northeastern India who found a mysterious 4-foot-long creature lying dead on the ground.\n\nWhat they discovered would spark excitement in the scientific community and remind us all that our planet still holds secrets waiting to be uncovered.\n\nIn 2021, scientists Sourabh Verma and Soham Pattekar were visiting a village in Bihar, a state in northeastern India, according to a study published in September in the peer-reviewed Journal of Asia-Pacific Biodiversity.\n\nThey had come to explore an area on the edge of the Valmiki Tiger Reserve—a region where the biodiversity, especially amphibians and reptiles, had been under-surveyed and poorly documented.\n\nThink about that for a moment: in our modern world of satellites and smartphones, there are still places where scientists simply haven’t had the chance to catalog all the creatures that live there.\n\nThis corner of India, near the boundaries of Gonauli village, was one of those places.\n\nAs the pair walked along the outskirts of the village, something caught their attention: a snake that was roughly four feet long with an oddly shaped snout.\n\nThe scientists couldn’t tell how the snake had died, but the snout was enough to grab their attention. It didn’t look like any known species.\n\nWhat happened next shows how modern science works like detective work.\n\nThe researchers tested the snake’s DNA, searching for matches in scientific databases. What they found was surprising: the closest genetic matches came from a pair of snakes found almost 700 miles away.\n\nThis was a major clue. Follow-up surveys and in-depth analysis confirmed what the scientists had begun to suspect. They hadn’t just found an unusual snake—they’d discovered a new species.\n\nThe team named their discovery Ahaetulla longirostris, or the long-snouted vine snake.\n\nThe scientific name comes from Latin words that any young language detective could decode: “longus,” meaning “long,” and “rostrum,” meaning “snout.” A fitting name for a vine snake with a strikingly-unique feature.\n\nThe long-snouted vine snake has some features that make it truly stand out in the animal kingdom.\n\nAccording to the study, these snakes are considered “medium sized,” reaching up to 4 feet in length. But it’s their heads that really set them apart.\n\nThey have “triangular” heads that taper into “very long” snouts, with the snout taking up roughly 18% of their entire head length. A close-up photo from the study shows just how oddly proportioned this feature appears—like a snake wearing a pointed mask.\n\nThe coloring of these snakes varies in ways that would catch any nature-lover’s eye.\n\nTheir bellies are typically orange, creating a warm, vibrant underside. But their backs tell a different story depending on the individual snake.\n\nSome are “bright green”—the kind of vivid color that would help them blend into leafy vegetation. Others sport an orange-brown coloring, photos from the study show.\n\nThis variation in coloring is one of nature’s clever tricks. Different colorations can help snakes survive in different environments, whether they’re hiding among green leaves or brown branches.\n\nHere’s something that might surprise families who think of rare species as living only in remote wilderness areas: the long-snouted vine snake lives in forests as well as “human-dominated” areas, such as cities and villages, researchers said.\n\nThis means these newly discovered snakes have been living alongside people in India—perhaps for a very long time—without scientists even knowing they existed as a distinct species.\n\nIt’s a powerful reminder that wildlife can thrive in places we might not expect, sometimes right in our own communities.\n\nSo far, long-snouted vine snakes have been found in Bihar and Meghalaya, two states of northeastern India near the borders with Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, the study said.\n\nBut the researchers suspect the new species is more widespread, potentially living in other areas that haven’t been thoroughly surveyed yet.\n\nIdentifying the long-snouted vine snake took several methods. They examined its snout, scale pattern, texture, and coloring. They also analyzed its DNA, comparing it to other known snakes.\n\nThe study identified the new species as a member of the A. fusca clade and as a sister species to A. laudankia.\n\nIn scientific terms, this means the long-snouted vine snake is closely related to certain other vine snakes but different enough to be classified as its own species.\n\nAccording to the study, the new species differs from its congeners—meaning related species in the same genus—in bearing an elongate rostral appendage, green or ochre dorsum, orange-brown belly, and moderately keeled vertebral dorsal scale row.\n\nThe discovery of the long-snouted vine snake was a team effort, thanks to researchers Zeeshan Mirza, Soham Pattekar, Sourabh Verma, Bryan Stuart, Jayaditya Purkayastha, Pratyush Mohapatra, and Harshil Patel.\n\nTheir work offers an inspiring lesson for curious minds of all ages: new species are still being found today. You don’t always need expensive equipment or trips to the most remote corners of the Earth.\n\nSometimes, discovery begins with simply paying attention to the world around you—noticing when something looks a little different, asking questions, and following the evidence wherever it leads.\n\nThe long-snouted vine snake waited in the forests and villages of northeastern India, unrecognized by science, until two researchers took a walk near a village and spotted something unusual lying on the ground.\n\nTheir curiosity—and their careful scientific work—added a new creature to humanity’s catalog of life on Earth.",

    "fullText": "GENEVA (AP) — The return of millions of Afghans from neighboring Pakistan and Iran is pushing Afghanistan to the brink, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday, describing an unprecedented scale of returns.\n\nA total of 5.4 million people have returned to Afghanistan since October 2023, mostly from the two neighboring countries, UNHCR’s Afghanistan representative Arafat Jamal said, speaking to a U.N. briefing in Geneva via video link from Kabul, the Afghan capital.\n\n“This is massive, and the speed and scale of these returns has pushed Afghanistan nearly to the brink,” Jamal said.\n\nPakistan launched a sweeping crackdown in Oct. 2023 to expel migrants without documents, urging those in the country to leave of their own accord to avoid arrest and forcible deportation and forcibly expelling others. Iran also began a crackdown on migrants at around the same time.\n\nSince then, millions have streamed across the border into Afghanistan, including people who were born in Pakistan decades ago and had built lives and created businesses there.\n\nLast year alone, 2.9 million people returned to Afghanistan, Jamal said, noting it was “the largest number of returns that we have witnessed to any single country.”\n\nAfghanistan’s Taliban rulers have criticized the mass expulsions.\n\nAfghanistan was already struggling with a dire humanitarian situation and a poor human rights record, particularly relating to women and girls, and the massive influx of people amounting to 12% of the population has put the country under severe strain, Jamal said.\n\nAlready in just the month and a half since the start of this year, about 150,000 people had returned to Afghanistan, he added.\n\nAfghan authorities provide care packages for those returning that include some food aid, cash, a telephone SIM card and transportation to parts of the country where they might have family. But the returns have strained resources in a country that was already struggling to cope with a weak economy and the effects of a severe drought and two devastating earthquakes.\n\nIn November, the U.N. development program said nine out of 10 families in areas of Afghanistan with high rates of return were resorting to what are known as negative coping mechanisms — either skipping meals, falling into debt or selling their belongings to survive.\n\n“We are deeply concerned about the sustainability of these returns,” Jamal said, noting that while 5% of those who return say they will leave Afghanistan again, more than 10% say they know of someone who has already left.\n\n“These decisions, I would underscore, to undertake dangerous journeys, are not driven by a lack of a desire to remain in the country, on the contrary, but the reality that many are unable to rebuild their viable and dignified lives,” he said.\n\nBecatoros reported from Athens, Greece.",

    "description": "Igor Tudor agrees a deal to become Tottenham interim head coach until the end of the season.",
    "fullText": "Igor Tudor has agreed a deal to become Tottenham interim head coach until the end of the season.\n\nThomas Frank was sacked earlier this week, with Spurs five points above the relegation places.\n\nSources told BBC Sport that Spurs wanted an interim manager in place for the players' return to training on Monday.\n\nTudor has been out of work since being sacked by Juventus in October 2025 following an eight-match winless run, leaving the club eighth in Serie A.\n\nThe 47-year-old has had a varied managerial career, having had stints at Lazio, Marseille, Galatasaray and Udinese among others.\n\nBBC Sport understands Tudor's experience of making an immediate impact at previous clubs was a contributing factor to his appointment.\n\nHe led hometown club Hajduk Split to the Croatian Cup in 2013 to win his only trophy as a manager.\n\nDuring a nine-year stint as a player with Juventus he won Serie A twice and finished runner-up in the 2003 Champions League final.\n\nTudor started his career with Hajduk Split and returned to the club before retiring aged 30, in 2008, due to problems with his ankle.\n\nHe also had loan spells with Croatian side Trogir and Italian outfit Siena.\n\nTudor was part of the Croatia squad that was knocked out of the 1998 World Cup at the semi-final stage, eventually finishing third.\n\nTottenham had several potential short-term options on their radar with former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic and ex-Red Bull Leipzig boss Marco Rose among them.\n\nTudor could be considered for the job on a permanent basis if he impresses in the role.\n\nBut former Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino is a candidate to permanently replace Frank, and his contract with the United States men's national team expires after this summer's World Cup.\n\nRoberto de Zerbi is another potential candidate, having left French club Marseille by mutual consent earlier this week.\n\nTudor's seventh-month reign at Juventus came to an end last October after an eight-match winless run in all competitions left The Old Lady eighth in Serie A and 25th in the league phase of the Champions League.\n\nEight wins in 17 league games across two seasons meant he left Turin with a win percentage of 47.1%, a dip from his previous records at Lazio - a brief spell that lasted just nine games - and Ligue 1 Marseille.\n\nJust one defeat in nine after being appointed by Juve in March 2025 helped them secure Champions League football, but three successive defeats without scoring led to his dismissal in October.\n\nIn Tudor's sole season in France, Marseille finished third behind Paris St-Germain and Lens, although they accrued more points than they had when finishing second in the previous season.\n\nThe former defender's only silverware as a manager came when he lifted the Croatian Cup with Hajduk Split in May 2013, taking charge of the two-legged final less than a month after being appointed.\n\nBBC Sport asked Spurs fans for their views on the appointment and this is what they said:\n\nTristen: Where to begin. The club are utterly clueless. Desperate and bereft of ideas. Sacking is the answer to every problem apparently, and plonking another random person out of thin air, with no Premier League experience is just mind boggling. Frank had been on the precipice for many weeks. Have someone lined up and be organised before you sack is business sense.\n\nGerald: Typical of the Tottenham board to go for what is probably the cheapest option and ignoring the daring or costly choices. Enic are supposed to have provided £100m for investing in the team yet spent what they got for Brennan Johnson our top scorer last season. Wish Mr Tudor all the best and hopefully can improve on Mr Frank.\n\nNigel: Igor who? A nothing appointment, who has no record of winning anything, but instead a pretty consistent record of failure and being sacked. Presumably Mr Lange reckons he can be the fall guy for his continuing failure. The stadium will be empty before the season ends.\n\nBillly: Was this really the plan? It's been obvious for weeks/months Frank was going to go and yet this is the best we could come up with?\n\nJohn: It is good that we have found an interim manager. I hope he does a great job, and he will become permanent. However, he might need to park his real beliefs as what is needed is rugged disciplined defence, coupled with calm sensible football in attack so the strikers can keep cool when chances present themselves.\n\nAndy: Igor Tudor? Wow this looks like another wild punt - when there is no time or place for one. Roberto de Zerbi would have been the obvious choice to put a rocket up our team with instant 100mph attacking football. Let's hope the board know something we don't. I'm not excited, which I should be. I am scared.\n\nRalph: Does it make any difference which manager you get, without the right players and knowledgeable recruitment staff, Spurs will be in the same position they are now, next season.\n\nDean: Spurs are going down, I can't understand the board, the situation we are in, we need someone that knows the Premier League and has past experience of galvanising the players. This is very underwhelming.\n\nPaul: Really don't know much about him so will give him a chance. It all depends how the players react. As individuals they are fine but as a team they totally lack cohesion in transition from defence to midfield and then to any kind of meaningful attacking policy.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych will not compete at the Winter Olympics after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) dismissed his appeal to wear a helmet depicting images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of his home country.\n\nHeraskevych asked Cas to reinstate his place at the Olympics after he was banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) before the first heat of the men's skeleton on Thursday.\n\nHaving worn the helmet, which the IOC say breaks rules in the Olympic charter, during training sessions this week, IOC president Kirsty Coventry visited him at Cortina's sliding track in a final attempt to convince him not to wear it in competition.\n\nBut the 26-year-old refused to back down, believing the helmet to be within the rules and an emergency ad-hoc Cas meeting took place on Friday.\n\nCas said while they are \"fully sympathetic\" to Heraskevych's case and his right to \"freedom of expression\", it is not permitted \"on the field of play\".\n\nThe IOC said Heraskevych could show his helmet in mixed zones, news conferences and on social media, but that \"the field of play is sacrosanct\".\n\nInitially, the IOC had withdrawn his accreditation but eventually returned it and Cas agreed it was \"unfair\" to rescind it \"under these circumstances\".\n\n'Shocking' or correct? Why Ukrainian skeleton slider was banned\n\nHeraskevych's appeal to Cas asked for his ban to be overturned, to be able to wear the helmet and to complete the two skeleton runs he missed out on on Thursday under the supervision of Cas.\n\nHe said his disqualification was \"disproportionate\" and claimed other athletes had been able to express their grief during competition at the Games.\n\nFor example, American figure skater Maxim Naumov held up a photograph of his parents, who were killed last year in a plane crash in Washington DC, as he waited for his score to come in earlier this week.\n\nBut the IOC say Heraskevych has contravened the 'athlete expression' guidelines, external, which were drawn up in 2023 and are part of Olympic law, which state \"focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances\".\n\nThe law states: \"It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference.\"\n\nOn Thursday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that if the committee allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games up to exploitation.\n\nBut Heraskevych has accused the Milan-Cortina Games of acting as \"Russian propaganda\" while Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, said, external the IOC are \"playing into the hands of the Russian aggressor\".\n\nHeraskevych, who was his nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony, has received support from his compatriots at the Games with Alpine skier Dmytro Shepiuk displayed a note reading \"Ukrainian heroes with us\" after competing while the Ukrainian mixed relay luge team took the knee and held their helmets aloft in a display of solidarity.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Pfizer's long-acting GLP-1 weight loss candidate could set the stage for a stock rally.",
    "fullText": "Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has a well-above-market dividend yield of 6.3%. Despite a payout ratio that is over 100%, the drugmaker states that it plans to maintain the dividend. But the real catalyst for a stock rally could come in June, when the company reports the results of testing for long-acting GLP-1 weight loss drug PF'3944. What should investors do?\n\nPfizer has two notable problems. First, it faces patent cliffs in 2027 and 2028, when the drugs Ibrance, Eliquis, and Vyndaqel lose patent protection. Generic competition is likely to lead to dramatic revenue declines for these blockbuster drugs. On top of that, the pharmaceutical giant has fallen behind in the GLP-1 weight loss drug race.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nNovo Nordisk was first to market with a GLP-1 shot. Eli Lilly's shot quickly gained traction, taking the lead in the space. And Pfizer's internally developed GLP-1 drug was dropped because it didn't work as hoped. Now Novo Nordisk has introduced a pill form of its GLP-1 drug, with Eli Lilly working hard to get its own pill to market. Pfizer had to acquire another company to get back in the race.\n\nPfizer's GLP-1 candidate, PF'3944, is advancing through clinical trials. The company plans to present data on the drug at the American Diabetes Association (ADA)'s Scientific Sessions in June. Pfizer's share price is already bouncing off the lows it hit in 2025. And if the data is as good as Pfizer seems to be suggesting, the update could prove to be a catalyst for further share price gains.\n\nThe big story, however, is that Pfizer's GLP-1 injection could be administered monthly. Currently, GLP-1 shots from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly require weekly injections. The new Novo Nordisk pill is taken daily. A GLP-1 drug that could be taken less frequently would likely be well received by consumers.\n\nGood news from the ADA Scientific Sessions could put Pfizer back in the running as a play on GLP-1 weight loss drugs. However, even if this specific drug isn't the catalyst that management seeks, Pfizer has other drugs in development. Given its strong history of innovation, it is highly likely that Pfizer will not only survive but also thrive over the long term. For more aggressive income investors, buying before the June data release is probably a worthwhile risk/reward trade-off.",

    "fullText": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (WCIA) — Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias announced a big change aimed at delivering faster, more secure vehicle titles.\n\nAccording to Giannoulias’ Office, Illinois motorists, lenders and dealers will soon experience faster title processing, fewer delays and stronger fraud protections as a result of the office transitioning to mandatory participation in its statewide Electronic Lien and Titling (ELT) program.\n\nIllinois bill would give cash aid to families who lose SNAP over work requirements\n\nMore specifically, all financial institutions that process five or more liens annually in Illinois will be required to transition to ELT by July 1. By replacing paper titles with a secure digital system, ELT aims to reduce mailing and storage costs, shorten processing times and provide real-time visibility into lien and title records.\n\n“Moving to mandatory Electronic Lien and Titling is the next step in bringing Illinois’ vehicle services fully into the digital age,” Giannoulias said. “This secure, paperless system cuts red tape for lenders and dealers, speeds up lien releases, accelerates the transfer process and better protects consumers. What once took weeks or months can occur within hours.”\n\nAdditionally, through ELT, lien and title records are transmitted directly and securely to the Secretary of State and maintained electronically by approved service providers until the lien is satisfied. When a loan is paid off, banks, credit unions and dealers can release the title instantaneously.\n\nThis system reduces operational risk and data entry errors, lowers administrative and mailing expenses, eliminates the need for physical title storage and improves transparency by giving lenders immediate access to lien and title status information.\n\nIllinois students encouraged to take advantage of ‘One Click College Admit’ in February\n\nIt also helps prevent “title washing” and fraudulent lien releases, protecting both consumers and financial institutions.\n\n“Together, the Secretary of State, IADA, and CHAMP Titles are committed to replacing slow, manual processes with modern digital solutions,” said Illinois Automobile Dealers Association Executive Director Joe McMahon. “By eliminating paper-based processes, the system significantly reduces processing times, with many transactions completed within hours. It improves accuracy, keeps rejection rates below 0.1%, and includes enhanced safeguards to help protect against fraud.”\n\nThere is no enrollment or annual participation fee. Statutory lien fees remain unchanged and continue to be collected at the point of sale, while any non-statutory service fees are assessed per transaction by the lienholder’s chosen provider.\n\nLienholders are able to enroll through an approved ELT service provider, including:\n\nEnrollment is also offered directly through the State ELT portal by contacting enroll@champtitles.com.",

    "description": "Rand Paul confronted the Trump administration's leaders on immigration enforcement with a breakdown of the shooting video of Alex Pretti.",
    "fullText": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) grilled Trump administration officials in charge of immigration enforcement during a Senate hearing on Thursday. Paul confronted them with a breakdown of the video of Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti’s fatal shooting, asking them if their officers acted professionally in killing a man he claimed did not show any aggression.\n\n“Today, we explore the rules of engagement, the rules for the proper use of force, and the rules for the use of force that are proportional to the threat,” Paul said. “My goal with this hearing is not to condemn or to argue to defund ICE; my goal is to restore public trust. If we don’t admit that there’s a problem, then we’re not going to get anywhere.”\n\nPaul played the video frame by frame and asked, “Is it an appropriate use of force to shove the woman to the ground here, Mr. Scott?”\n\n“I can’t answer that,” U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott said, “because this video doesn’t show everything that led up to it, the encounters before. That investigation is ongoing.”\n\n“So, let’s say hypothetically two women were yelling at one of your officers. Is it okay to shove them to the ground?” Paul pressed.\n\nBoth Scott and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd M. Lyons answered, “No, sir,” but didn’t answer definitively when asked if it looked like the officers attempted to de-escalate the situation.\n\n.@SenRandPaul & @SenGaryPeters break down video of Alex Pretti shooting video.\n\nSen. @RandPaul: \"It destroys the trust in ICE… I see nothing here, I mean not even a hint of something that was aggressive on his part.\" pic.twitter.com/SckWt2X5wP\n\n— CSPAN (@cspan) February 12, 2026\n\n“I think what’s important about the encounter isn’t even the specifics of the investigation. It’s about, what are your officers are trained to do,” Paul said. “So, there were people who said that, ‘Yes, the officers were using de-escalation tactics.’ Nobody believes that,” Paul said. “No one in America believes that shoving that woman’s face in the snow was de-escalation.”\n\nWhen Paul got to the officers’ interaction with Pretti, he said, “At no time in the encounter do you see him try to strike an officer, nor does he brandish a weapon, which was alleged as well.”\n\n“I don’t see any resistance, but it’s kinda hard to tell when you have six people on you and you’re moving,” Paul said. “I mean, the natural instinct when you have six people on top of you is to try to move — you’re not going to be placid. But, I see nothing here, I mean not even a hint of something that was aggressive on his part.”\n\n“And so, I don’t think this should take months and months and years and years — there needs to be a conclusion,” Paul said of the investigation into the officers’ conduct. “But we need to have answers here, and there needs to be an announcement, ‘These are the new policies, this is how we’re going to interact with the public.'”\n\nOn CBS Mornings, Wednesday, Paul said he believed that Lyons owed an apology to the families of Pretti and Renee Good.\n\nWatch the clip above via YouTube.\n\nThe post Rand Paul Plays Alex Pretti Killing During Senate Hearing: ‘Not Even a Hint’ of Aggression ‘On His Part’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "John Fortney: Some of the guys I trained with would’ve made sure the hoodie-wearing cameraman tackled by an Ohio State professor didn’t get up.",
    "fullText": "John Fortney has worked for the Ohio Senate for more than a decade.\n\nThe left wants to politicize and smear the mission of Ohio State's Salmon P. Chase Center for Civics, Culture and Society over an incident that can clearly be called self-defense.\n\nWhat the media and special interests have reported and posted focuses on the untrained eye and rush to judgment by the real radicals on the left.\n\nWithin the first second of the video that went viral, an unknown man, I’ll call him “Mr. Hoodie,” who had his hood up inside the building steps toward assistant professor Luke M. Perez aggressively.\n\nThat fast move or lunge toward anyone could be considered a threat and it also appears contact was made by Mr. Hoodie, who apparently was a blogger.\n\nI have a background in Krav Maga and self-defense.\n\nThe first thing we were taught in assessing a threat was to read body language. Is the person in front of you moving slowly toward you in a non-threatening manner or is the person in front of you displaying aggressive behavior and mannerisms, including rushing at you.\n\nIn this case, not only was “Mr. Hoodie” aggressive, but he was also well within the professor’s personal space holding what appears to be a DSLR camera with a microphone that could be used as a weapon. What else could he have been carrying in his pockets?\n\nThe professor had a second to act, and he responded reasonably to defend himself and the people who might still have been inside the classroom.\n\nAnother view: Ohio State professor must pay for unhinged attack on cameraman\n\nHe dislodged what Mr. Hoodie was holding in a well-trained way and took him to the floor. When the threat was over, he let him up. It looked a lot like the drills we practiced in Krav Maga. However, some of the guys I trained with would’ve made sure Mr. Hoodie didn’t get up.\n\nIn firearms training, we learned about the 21-foot rule. For example, if someone with a knife, hammer, or baseball bat is within approximately 21 feet of you and your handgun is holstered, that threat can cover the distance before you can draw and fire. That is how dangerous this situation could have been.\n\nThe professor acted reasonably and ended the threat.\n\nHow did Mr. Hoodie and friends get into the building in the first place? Credentialed media are easily identifiable — these clowns were not.\n\nLast year, Charlie Kirk was assassinated.

    "title": "Billionaire Google founder sparks backlash after pulling $450 million megayacht into US port: 'Burned through'",
    "description": "It turns heads for its massive size and luxury.",
    "fullText": "While millions of Americans worry about rising home energy costs, one $450 million megayacht consumes enough electricity each day to supply about 800 homes.\n\nThe colossal 466-foot-long vessel was on stark display in early December, docked during the Art Basel 2025 show in Miami Beach. Called Dragonfly, the megayacht is owned by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who sailed it into Florida for the elite art showcase.\n\nWith a status as one of the largest private yachts in the world, Luxurylaunches described Dragonfly as \"something closer to a floating skyscraper than a yacht.\" The vessel has enough space to house up to 18 guests — and a 40-member crew.\n\nWhile Brin visited Art Basel, his docked megayacht continued to run its extensive energy-hungry systems — including air conditioning, lights, IT infrastructure, security systems, and more. The result is a concerning environmental impact that shows the gap between the ultra-wealthy and the average American.\n\nTogether, all of Dragonfly's luxe megayacht accommodations consume electricity at a rate equivalent to powering hundreds of average Florida homes per day. Experts told Luxurylaunches that on a heavy operational day, Dragonfly can consume an estimated 28,800 kilowatt-hours in 24 hours. The average Florida household uses about 1,104 kilowatt-hours per month.\n\n\"Dragonfly's single day at the dock equals the daily electricity use of roughly 780 to 800 Florida households,\" the outlet noted. \"Look at it another way, and it is about 26 Florida households' entire monthly consumption, burned through in 24 hours.\"\n\nWith electricity totaling an estimated $0.30 per kilowatt-hour, Luxurylaunches noted that Dragonfly's electricity bill alone comes to roughly $8,640 per day. Dragonfly runs on a hybrid diesel-electric system, which helps offset some of its environmental impact — but certainly not enough to classify it as environmentally clean or neutral.\n\nAs many communities face rising energy costs and feel the burdens of rising global pollution, the ultra-wealthy continue to burn resources at an astonishing — and largely unchecked — scale.\n\nThis massive consumption simply for pure luxury undercuts collective efforts to slow rising global temperatures. Stronger climate policy, true accountability, and greater investment in clean energy are needed to help address resource overuse and the growing damage superyachts cause to our oceans.\n\nAll superyachts also have outsized impacts on marine ecosystems and human health, regardless of whether they are electric, hybrid, or powered entirely by dirty energy. Beyond harmful carbon pollution, superyachts release wastewater, generate plastic waste, and flood marine environments with artificial light.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nNotably, superyachts also generate a great deal of noise pollution, an often overlooked threat that experts warn can be as damaging as air pollution. Research links chronic noise exposure to hearing loss, sleep disruption, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and developmental delays in children.\n\nAt sea, excessive noise can interfere with whale and dolphin communication, placing species that depend on sound for navigation, feeding, and survival at risk.\n\nDragonfly may turn heads for its massive size and luxury, but its harmful environmental impact is impossible to ignore. As the realities of environmental pollution become increasingly dire, the extreme excess of superyachts like Dragonfly shows how the wealthy can sidestep environmental responsibility — while contributing to global pollution on a scale few others ever could.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Amid President Donald Trump's repeated targeting of the country with threats and insults, Canadian travel to the U.S. has remained at record low levels. This is despite early analyst predictions that the initial nosedive, occurring when Trump introduced 25% tariffs in February 2025, would reverse.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2026, Canadian airlines are still running 10% fewer seats on flights to the U.S. than they had in 2025, while statistics from the Canadian government show that the number of car trips from Canadians crossing the border to return home has hovered at more than a 20% decrease for months.\n\nCanadian airlines Air Canada, WestJet, Flair Airlines, and Air Transat have also responded by significantly reducing their network of flights to smaller U.S. airports.\n\nA Montréal-based carrier flying Canadians to many popular vacation destinations, Air Transat will now completely cut all U.S. service by phasing out its flights to Florida from Montréal and Québec City by June 2026, Travel Weekly reported.\n\nThe airline's flight between Montréal-Trudeau International Airport (YUL) and Orlando International (MSO) will run for the last time on May 4, and the flight from Québec City (YQB) and Fort Lauderdale (FLL) will end on May 30. The last flight between Montréal and Fort Lauderdale will run on June 13.\n\n\"This decision is part of a strategic review of our program aimed at focusing our resources on markets where we are well positioned and that allow us to optimize the deployment of our resources,\" spokesperson Marie-Eve Vallières Vallières said in a statement to Canadian outlet Travelweek. \"Florida represents a market where our exposure remains very limited and that is more fragile in the current context.\"\n\nAir Transat has not yet confirmed whether another two of its seasonal routes to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU) in Puerto Rico from Montréal and Toronto will return in December.\n\nAir Transat's main market still comes from resort cities such as Cancun and Punta Cana, but in the last year, it has significantly expanded its network to new destinations in Mexico and the Caribbean. It is also launching new routes to more faraway countries such as Senegal, Albania, and Iceland.\n\n\"Air Transat's presence in the United States remains very marginal today, representing only 1% of our available seat‑kilometer capacity for the summer,\" Vallières said further.",

    "description": "Former New Jersey teacher Julie Rizzitello sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting two students she groomed at Wall High School.",
    "fullText": "A former New Jersey high school teacher who groomed two of her students before sexually assaulting them, including at her family’s bagel shop, was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison, prosecutors said.\n\nJulie Rizzitello, 37, who taught at Wall High School in Wall Township, was sentenced during a hearing in Monmouth County Superior Court, according to the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office.\n\nJudge Jill G. O’Malley ordered that she serve 10 years in state prison, be placed on parole supervision for life, register as a sex offender under Megan’s Law, which requires certain offenders to register with law enforcement, have no contact with the victims and permanently forfeit her teaching position.\n\nWest Virginia Teacher Fired After Arrest On Child Sex Abuse Charge\n\nRizzitello had pleaded guilty in September to two counts of second-degree sexual assault stemming from crimes in 2017 and 2024.\n\nProsecutors said the sexual acts took place at Rizzitello’s home in Brick, inside a vehicle in a Wall Township parking lot and at a Belmar bagel shop owned by her family, where both victims worked at her suggestion.\n\nAn investigation by the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office Special Victims Bureau and Wall Township police found that Rizzitello met one victim as a freshman and the other as a junior at the high school. Authorities said she asked to spend time alone with the teens and developed a friendly relationship before escalating to sexual activity over several months.\n\nWhile the investigation was ongoing, Rizzitello contacted both victims and asked them to delete evidence of the crimes from their electronic devices, authorities said.\n\nPolice arrested Rizzitello without incident in July 2024 after a district employee notified them of her relationship with a student, according to the Coast Star.\n\nFormer Missouri Substitute Teacher Gets 10 Years For Trading Students Money, Drugs For Sex\n\nThe incidents involving the first victim took place in May and June 2024, according to the outlet, citing a police arrest warrant.\n\nRizzitello and the student, who had turned 18, had sexual contact in his car in Brick in May 2024, NJ.com reported, citing an affidavit of probable cause. They also met at other locations, and she sent him nude photos, officials said.\n\nAfter her arrest, a second victim came forward and told investigators he and Rizzitello had intercourse in November 2017 and January 2018 at her residence in Brick Township, according to the Coast Star, citing an affidavit of probable cause. The victim was 17 at the time. Pictures and text messages corroborated his account, the outlet reported.\n\nFormer Texas Coach Allegedly Used Ai Document To Groom Teen With Manipulation Tactics: Report\n\nIn imposing the sentence on Wednesday, O’Malley denied a defense request to reduce the prison term to five years, referencing a victim impact statement read aloud in court, according to prosecutors.\n\n\"These crimes were not isolated incidents constituting moments of poor judgment; they were textbook cases of grooming, involving a defendant who repeatedly leveraged tactics of isolation, manipulation, and control for the sake of her own selfish purposes,\" Monmouth County Prosecutor Raymond S. Santiago said. \"The egregious nature of the conduct was further compounded by the plain fact that the emotional and psychological harm she inflicted came at the expense of two of the very same young minds she had been entrusted to develop and nurture.\"\n\nWall Township Police Chief Sean O’Halloran praised the victims for coming forward.\n\n\"I want to commend the courage of those who came forward to report these crimes. It is never easy to speak up, especially when the offender is someone in a position of trust,\" O’Halloran said.\n\nRizzitello, who taught English, was hired in 2013 and earned an annual salary of about $62,000 before resigning, according to NJ.com.\n\nIn July 2024, Wall Township Public Schools acknowledged the charges and said the district was fully cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Friday it was “sensible” for a South Korean government official to express regret for alleged civilian drone flights over North Korea but warned of counterattacks if they recur.\n\nThe statement by Kim Yo Jong came after South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young on Tuesday expressed “deep regret” over the alleged flights and stressed that Seoul’s liberal government seeks “mutual recognition and peaceful coexistence” between the war-divided rivals.\n\nNorth Korea threatened retaliation last month after accusing South Korea of launching a surveillance drone flight in September and again in January.\n\nThe South Korean government has denied operating any drones during the times specified by North Korea but law enforcement authorities are investigating three civilians suspected of flying drones into the North from border areas.\n\nThe development threatens to further dampen prospects for a push by Seoul to resume long-stalled talks with North Korea amid a deepening nuclear standoff.\n\nKim Yo Jong said Chung’s comments displayed “sensible behavior” but were insufficient as a government response, demanding stronger measures from Seoul to prevent similar activities in the future.\n\n“I give advance warning that reoccurrence of such provocation as violating the inalienable sovereignty of the DPRK will surely provoke a terrible response,” she said, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\n“Various counterattack plans are on the table and one of them will be chosen without doubt and it will go beyond proportionality,” she said without specifying.\n\nThe Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said the alleged drone flights ran counter to the government’s principles of reducing tensions and that it plans to take unspecified steps to prevent similar incidents.\n\nAnalysts say North Korea’s drone accusations were likely driven by its efforts to dial up anti-South Korea sentiments ahead of the ruling Workers’ Party congress in late February. North Korea could add leader Kim Jong Un’s declaration of a hostile “two-state” system on the Korean Peninsula in the party constitution during the congress, the first of its kind in five years.\n\nThere have been no public talks between the Koreas since 2019 and drone flights are a source of animosity between the rivals.",

    "fullText": "We need to accept that Liverpool are not in the running to retain their Premier League title.\n\nIt looks like Arsenal will contest the title with Manchester City - with the Reds very much stuck in the fight for Champions League football.\n\nIt’s been a difficult season for Arne Slot - who has been unable to get any kind of consistency out of the league champions. The head coach has also struggled to integrate £450m worth of new signings - and he has been dealing with significant injury troubles.\n\nPoor results have left the Anfield side fighting it out with Chelsea and Manchester United for a Champions League place - with Aston Villa even further ahead in the table.\n\nIt’s overwhelmingly likely that fifth place will be enough to secure a return to the Champions League due to England's coefficient - bringing with it potentially over £100m of participation fees, prize money and broadcast revenues.\n\nIt’s money that Liverpool cannot afford to live without - but there is every reason to believe that the club are about to take a decisive step towards securing it.\n\nThis midweek round of fixtures saw rivals Man Utd and Chelsea slip up - encountering draws against West Ham and Leeds respectively.\n\nAs a consequence the Reds have been able to claw back two more points in the race to gain a top-five finish courtesy of their 1-0 win up in Sunderland.\n\nAround the corner is a very winnable run of fixtures - and Arne Slot needs to be aiming to win 15 points out of the next 15.\n\nFirst of all across their next three league fixtures Liverpool will play three of the current bottom four. Crisis club Nottingham Forest are in 17th - and beyond the Tricky Trees away Liverpool will play West Ham (18) at home and Wolves (20) away.\n\nAfter that there are more bottom-dwellers in the shape of Tottenham (16) at home and Brighton (14) away.\n\nFollowing the Brighton game we will encounter the international window - with Liverpool facing Fulham (h), Everton (a) and Crystal Palace (h) in their subsequent three fixtures.\n\nMan Utd by contrast in their next five matches face only Crystal Palace who are currently in the bottom half of the table.\n\nBefore March is out they will play Everton (a), Palace (h), Newcastle (a), Aston Villa (h) and Bournemouth (a) - games they will not be looking forward to.\n\nAlthough Chelsea have got a gentle-looking game against Burnley coming up next at home after that they play two of the top three in succession - facing both Arsenal and Aston Villa away from home.\n\nBefore the international break they will play Newcastle at home and Everton away - by no means easy fixtures. Right after the break they will face Man City and Man Utd at home - meaning they are due to play every one of the top four in their next seven fixtures.\n\nRight now Liverpool fans are not so optimistic about making it back into the Champions League - particularly as they have to play Man Utd, Chelsea, Villa and Brentford in the run-in.\n\nBut there is every reason to believe that by the March international window the table will look very different - and Liverpool will have some breathing space in the chase for the rich prizes on offer in the Champions League.",

    "fullText": "Igor Thiago has said it is true love with Brentford after signing a new contract with the club.\n\nThiago has put pen to paper on an improved deal at Brentford, following an explosivePremier League campaign. The Brazilian has scored 17 goals in 26 games, with only Manchester City striker Erling Haaland having outscored Thiago in the Premier League.\n\nThe 24-year-old has now distanced himself from transfer speculation by signing a new five-and-a-half deal.\n\nThiago's new contract comes on the same day he was named asPremier League Player of the Month for January, his second monthly award this season. He also picked up the prize in November 2025 and is the first Brazilian to have won the award more than once.\n\nThiago's form could earn him a maiden call-up for Brazil ahead of the 2026 World Cup, and no Brazilian has scored more goals across Europe's top leagues this season.\n\nSpeaking to theclub's official website, Thiago thanked Brentford for the belief the club have shown in him.\n\n“I love the club and the people in the club. It’s a true love, a real love,\" he said.\n\n“In the beginning, when I first came, I had the injury. The staff and the people around the training ground were helping me and supporting me.\n\n“When the fans support me, and I see them singing my name and singing my song, it gives me more power. I’m really happy for all of the love they have given to me. It means so much.\n\n“With Keith (Andrews), it’s more of a relationship as a father and a son. I’m really happy with him as he trusts and believes in me\n\n“I’m enjoying every single day and every single training session so much. It’s been a good journey and I’m happy to be here.”",

    "fullText": "There’s little doubt that Dana White’s move into boxing has caused a major rift between him and Eddie Hearn.\n\nWhen the UFC president first made it clear he was planning to stick around in boxing for the long haul, Hearn didn’t hold back. He let it be known right away that he wasn’t exactly rolling out the welcome mat.\n\nThat took some people by surprise, given that the two have generally had a good rapport over the years. They’ve worked together on various occasions and seemed to get along just fine.\n\nBut with White now in charge of Zuffa Boxing, tensions have clearly started to build. And when White recently unveiled his plans for Zuffa Boxing’s first title fight, Hearn didn’t waste any time criticising it.\n\nEarlier this week, White confirmed that Jai Opetaia will headline Zuffa Boxing 4 against Brandon Glanton, with both the Ring Magazine and IBF world cruiserweight titles on the line.\n\nBut there will be more than just those titles up for grabs. The event will also feature the debut of the Zuffa Boxing belt, as the promotion moves forward with plans to install a champion in every division.\n\nThat decision hasn’t gone down well with Hearn, who has voiced concerns about introducing a new title belt.\n\n“Do you think I would disrespect boxing that much where I would bring out the Matchroom Boxing world championship?” Hearn told IFL TV.\n\nHe added: “My ego is out of control, but that’s beyond anything I could ever fathom.”\n\nThe 46-year-old went on to claim that Zuffa are disrespecting the history of boxing by going against the sanctioning bodies that have stood in place since the beginning of the sport.\n\nEven with their ongoing feud, there’s still a chance White and Hearn could team up for an event down the line.\n\nAlthough White’s focus right now is on developing young talent, there’s little doubt he’ll want Zuffa Boxing to host major fights, which could mean collaborating with other promoters becomes necessary.\n\nUFC fighter calls out Terence Crawford to settle rivalry, names date and venue\n\nTerence Crawford hits back at UFC star who believes he could kill Shakur Stevenson\n\nShakur Stevenson offers Ilia Topuria a route into boxing debut after Floyd Mayweather comparisons",

    "fullText": "Lorenzo Pellegrini lost his armband at the start of the season, but he remains a key figure in the dressing room.\n\nThe player’s contract is expiring, and his contractual situation is a hotly debated topic at Trigoria. “We shouldn’t have gotten to this point, but I have no doubt that players whose contracts are expiring will give their all until the end,” said Gian Piero Gasperini, commenting on the matter.\n\nThe Giallorossi’s number 7, according to Il Corriere dello Sport, is hoping for a renewal at the end of the season.\n\nAt Trigoria, there’s a new policy aimed at reducing the wage bill, and Pellegrini, who earns around €6 million, will also have to comply with the new guidelines. For this very reason, rumors of interest from England are becoming increasingly insistent.\n\nPellegrini provides Gasperini with a versatility that few players in the Roma squad possess in that position. Despite some subpar games, the attacking midfielder has started several times, despite his injuries.\n\nHe should also start against Napoli. In a physical and tactical match against a coach like Antonio Conte, who has repeatedly attempted to bring him to the Azzurri, Pellegrini could guarantee presence on both sides of the pitch, unlike a more attacking player like Paulo Dybala.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot has blamed Liverpool's poor record at set pieces for the club's difficult title defence.\n\nLiverpool are sixth in thePremier League table and 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal. The Reds have endured a challenging campaign this time around, having won a record-equalling 20th league title last season.\n\nSpeaking ahead of tomorrow's FA Cup fourth-round tie with Brighton, Slot said the club's poor set-piece record has contributed to their struggles.\n\nOnly Bournemouth (16) have conceded more set-piece goals than Liverpool in thePremier League this season (14), while the champions rank only 10th for goals scored from set-piece situations. Leaders Arsenal, in contrast, have scored the most set-piece goals (16) in the division.\n\n\"My first thought in my head was no because I have always said it is almost impossible to win a game of football with a negative set-piece balance.\n\n\"In the Premier League, every game is now a big game because of the strength of the league, but looking at where the league has gone to I should maybe not say no, I should say yes because I cannot stop talking about the importance of set pieces. It's every single day.\n\n\"You asked me in the past what the difference is between our performances in the Champions League and Premier League and the most simple answer is set pieces because in the Champions League we are top in set pieces and in the Premier League we are completely bottom. That reflects in the league table as well.\n\n\"The current Premier League is so, so, so much more about set pieces than it was last season. Even though I already found it very important, it has now gone through the roof in terms of how important it is.\n\n\"It is actually impossible to win the league if you have a set-piece balance like ours. You have to have plus five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, no matter what you do in open play, to have a chance to win the league.\"",

    "fullText": "There have been internal conversations at Chelsea this week about Pedro Neto, with the club reacting to growing interest in the winger ahead of the upcoming summer transfer window.\n\nChelsea paid around £54 million to bring Pedro Neto over from Wolves. At first, that fee seemed steep, but he found his stride midway through the season, scoring four times and providing two assists over a seven-game stretch.\n\nHis numbers were not bad last season either, finishing with nine goals and nine assists across all competitions.\n\nRecently, however, the Portuguese winger has struggled. His display against his former club, Wolves, was particularly concerning: Neto failed to complete any of his eight attempted crosses and conceded possession a notable 14 times.\n\nAccording to TeamTALK, Pedro Neto is perfectly comfortable with his situation at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe report notes that Neto feels settled in West London and believes he is valued by the coaching staff. He is also said to be fully behind the club’s long-term plans.\n\nAnd his partner, Carolina Silva, appears to be enjoying London as well, with no sign that either of them is looking to move any time soon.\n\nInternally, Chelsea are not concerned about Neto’s recent form and any suggestion that they are considering selling him seems wide of the mark.\n\nBlueCo consider the Portuguese winger an exemplary professional and are certain he would be challenging to replace should he depart Stamford Bridge.\n\nNeto just needs to raise his game ahead of Geovany Quenda’s arrival this summer.\n\nLooking at the numbers, Neto is most effective when playing as a right-winger, where he can use his left foot to cut inside and create chances.\n\nLiam Rosenior has used him in a variety of roles this season, including out wide on the left and sometimes in more central areas to open up space for Cole Palmer.\n\nBut this shift has not really played to his strengths. His ability to cut in from the right and curl shots with his left foot has been limited by the change.\n\nOne area where the 25-year-old Portuguese has made clear progress this season is his defensive contribution. His heat map highlights 66 defensive recoveries in league play, showing a real commitment to tracking back and supporting his full-back.\n\nAnge Postecoglou wanted Tottenham to sign £54m player before Chelsea move\n\nEx-Chelsea boss emerges as contender for Tottenham role after Thomas Frank",

Some Gooners have tried to warn our peers how quickly momentum can change in sport and how mentality is crucial at the highest level.\n\nHow you view our performance on Thursday will depend on your views about the title race.\n\nThose who think the Gunners have one hand on the Premiership will say it’s simply a coincidence that we looked terrified in the second half at Brentford, the home side looked more likely to get a winner, Raya looked unsettled, and our manager looked white as a ghost.\n\nI see a correlation between our display and the fact that we played 24 hours after watching our rivals win.\n\nLike when so many players went missing against Man United a day after City had won. Like we didn’t work Forest’s keeper enough later in the day when City lost the Manchester Derby. Like when the Emirates was crippled by anxiety the day after City was held by Brighton.\n\nIf you compare those games with how commanding other wins have been, what’s the key difference? On those occasions, the league leaders kicked off before City.\n\nSometimes in football, you need luck. That includes the fixture list.\n\nMikel Arteta and Pep Guardiola (Getty Images)\n\nBecause of the Carabao Cup Final, our trip to Wolves has been moved forward to next Wednesday.\n\nFollowing that, the schedule has Arsenal playing after Man City in 3 out of the next 4 match days.

Yet it doesn’t work like that at this time of the year, not if you have the pressure of having to always play after the team hunting you down.\n\nWe have not won the last 4 times that has happened.

    "fullText": "Over the past decade, sustained success in the NBA has demanded far more than star talent alone. Championship contention now hinges on organizational stability, roster continuity, advanced analytics, and the ability to evolve with the modern pace-and-space era. The teams with the highest winning percentages over the last ten years represent more than statistical excellence — they embody strategic vision, player development, and resilience across multiple playoff cycles.\n\nMORE: NBA championship chances by SportsLine\n\nAt the forefront stands the Boston Celtics, whose identity has been defined by elite two-way play and a culture built on defensive accountability and adaptability. Close behind, the Milwaukee Bucks transformed sustained regular-season dominance into championship glory behind the generational force of Giannis Antetokounmpo. In the Western Conference, the Denver Nuggets emerged as a model of patience and precision, with Nikola Jokić orchestrating one of the league’s most efficient offenses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Golden State Warriors extended their era-defining dominance through innovation and championship experience, fueled by the transformative shooting of Stephen Curry. Rounding out the group, the Los Angeles Clippers consistently fielded deep, versatile rosters capable of competing with any contender on a nightly basis.\n\nTogether, these franchises illustrate what sustained excellence looks like in today’s league — not just flashes of brilliance, but a decade of strategic execution, adaptability, and relentless competitiveness.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .648\nBoston has been one of the NBA’s most consistent contenders, built around elite two-way wings. With multiple deep playoff runs and an NBA championship during this stretch, the Celtics combined defensive intensity with offensive versatility. Their culture of toughness kept them among the league’s elite.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .608\nThe Bucks’ dominance was anchored by Giannis Antetokounmpo’s MVP-caliber performances. Milwaukee secured an NBA title and regularly finished near the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Their combination of size, defense, and star power made them perennial threats.\n\nMORE: NBA points per game season leaders before the 2026 All-Star weekend\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .608\nBehind Nikola Jokić’s brilliance, Denver became a championship-winning franchise. The Nuggets’ balanced roster and efficient offense culminated in an NBA Finals victory during the decade. Their patience in team-building paid off in sustained success.\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .606\nGolden State continued its dynasty run with another championship in this span. Stephen Curry’s shooting and championship experience kept the Warriors in contention despite injuries and roster changes. Their offensive system remained one of the most feared in basketball.\n\nMORE: NBA 2026 Slam Dunk contest participants\n\nApproximate winning percentage: .572\nThe Clippers consistently fielded competitive teams built around elite wing talent. Though a championship eluded them, they remained strong playoff participants year after year. Their depth and defensive versatility kept them among the Western Conference’s toughest squads.\n\nUltimately, the teams with the highest winning percentages over the past decade reveal a clear pattern: long-term success is rarely accidental. It is built through smart roster construction, elite player performance, and organizational commitment to evolution. While each franchise followed a different path — from dynastic continuity to patient rebuilding — they all achieved the same outcome: sustained relevance in the league’s most competitive era. Their decade-long excellence sets the modern benchmark for what it truly means to contend year after year.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nOLYMPICS: Norway skier goes viral after displaying insane Winter Olympics speed\n\nSUPER BOWL: Ranking the last 10 NFL Super Bowl champions\n\nMLB: Texas Rangers’ Nolan Ryan jersey giveaway is a bloody mess\n\nMEDIA: Photos of potential suspect in Nancy Guthrie disappearance released by FBI\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break\n\nVIRAL: Norwegian Olympics star makes stunning girlfriend admission after winning bronze medal\n\nThe post NBA teams with the highest winning percentages over the last 10 years appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan return to San Siro on Saturday night knowing another Derby d’Italia victory would strengthen their grip on the Serie A title race.\n\nCristian Chivu’s side start the weekend clear at the top and this fixture offers another chance to keep the chasing pack at arm’s length.\n\nInter’s form suggests they will take some stopping, having gone 12 league matches unbeaten and coming into this clash fresh from dismantling Sassuolo 5-0.\n\nThat result was the latest reminder of their depth and their rhythm, with Federico Dimarco again at the centre of everything as Inter tore through opponents who could not live with their intensity.\n\nIt also extended a run of five consecutive wins across all competitions, keeping Inter in the hunt on multiple fronts as their season builds towards its defining months.\n\nHowever, Juventus remain the opponent that continues to make Inter’s life uncomfortable, regardless of what the league table says.\n\nThe reverse fixture in September was a chaotic seven-goal thriller which Juventus won 4-3, and it remains one of the clearest examples of how quickly Inter can lose control in the biggest moments.\n\nInter have also dropped points in direct matches against the other leading sides this season, a trend they will be desperate to end in front of their own supporters.\n\nJuventus arrive in Milan without the same sense of momentum, and their recent performances have lacked authority.\n\nLuciano Spalletti’s side needed a 96th-minute equaliser from Pierre Kalulu to salvage a 2-2 draw against Lazio last weekend, and that result captured the uneven feel of their current run.\n\nJuventus have won only one of their last four matches in all competitions, and their away form has been particularly worrying, with goals proving hard to come by.\n\nEven so, fixtures like this have never followed a script, and Juventus have enough attacking quality to punish any lapse.\n\nKenan Yildiz has already hurt Inter in recent meetings, and the visitors will believe they can make this another night of chaos.\n\nFor Inter, the task is to stay calm and stay clinical.\n\nThey have the league’s strongest structure, a deep squad and a lead worth protecting, but they will need to match Juventus’ edge and emotion.\n\nIf they do, they will be well placed to grind out the type of win champions often require.\n\nIf Juventus produce something extraordinary, Inter will need to show they can survive the kind of test that has previously derailed them.",

    "description": "The Trump Environmental Protection Agency delivered a significant blow to longstanding US climate policy on Thursday, finalizing rules to revoke a 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration delivered a deadly blow to longstanding US climate policy on Thursday, finalizing rules that revoke the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate climate pollution.\n\nFirst issued in 2009, the endangerment finding determined that six greenhouse gases could be categorized as dangerous to human health under the Clean Air Act. It has underpinned the EPA’s authority to limit planet-warming pollution from the oil and gas industry, power plants and vehicles since the Obama administration and is considered the federal government’s most powerful tool to tackle climate pollution and the country’s contribution to the global crisis.\n\n“We are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding,” President Donald Trump said on Thursday, calling the policy “disastrous.”\n\nTrump said repealing the regulations “has nothing to do with public health.”\n\n“This was all a scam, a giant scam,” Trump said on Thursday. “This was a rip off of the country by Obama and Biden.”\n\nIn addition, the Trump administration will finalize a repeal of rules that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, since they stem from the finding. Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA sought to tighten those standards to prod the auto industry to make more fuel-efficient hybrids and electric vehicles — an effort the industry has since backtracked on.\n\nThe full text of EPA’s repeal of the endangerment finding wasn’t made available before the Trump administration announced it, but the justification for the repeal laid out in an EPA press release relies far more on legal arguments than an outright rejection of climate science.\n\nThe agency is arguing that the Obama and Biden administrations exceeded their legal authority when they used the Clean Air Act to regulate climate pollution. This is in contrast to last summer, when the agency first proposed the repeal. The EPA proposal was then based in part on a hastily produced report authored by five climate contrarians that questioned the severity of climate impacts like wildfires, extreme heat and stronger storms.\n\nInstead of doubling down on that Thursday, the Trump EPA in a press release concluded the Clean Air Act “does not provide statutory authority for EPA” to put forward vehicle emissions standards “including for the purpose of addressing global climate change, and therefore has no legal basis for the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations.”\n\nHowever, in the same press release announcing the repeal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin nodded to the administration’s opposition to climate policy.\n\n“Referred to by some as the ‘Holy Grail’ of the ‘climate change religion,’ the Endangerment Finding is now eliminated,” Zeldin said in the EPA’s press release. While speaking next to Trump on Thursday, however, Zeldin’s remarks were slightly different.\n\n“Today, the Trump EPA has finalized the single largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States of America. Referred to by some as the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach, the 2009 Obama EPA endangerment finding is now eliminated,” Zeldin said on Thursday.\n\nLegal precedent has granted the government regulatory powers over climate pollution. The US Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that EPA had the authority to regulate climate pollution from greenhouse gases. And in 2022, the US Supreme Court upheld the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants, but narrowed the agency’s scope significantly, prompting the Biden administration to formulate rules aimed only at making individual power plants more efficient.\n\nThe 2022 Supreme Court ruling “never questioned that EPA had the authority to regulate greenhouse gases,” said Meredith Hankins, legal director for federal climate at the Natural Resources Defense Fund. “That was settled law.”\n\nBut the endangerment finding repeal will thrust that question back into the courts, where litigating the repeal could take years, and potentially go all the way to the nation’s highest court. A former top Biden EPA official told CNN he believes this move shows the Trump administration is playing a legal long game.\n\n“Their definition of winning I believe has been and will be when they take final action and defend their action in the courts, to permanently remove EPA’s Clean Air Act authority to regulate greenhouse gases,” said Joe Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under Biden.\n\nIf the Trump administration repeal is “upheld in court, no future EPA will be able to regulate (carbon dioxide) emissions,” said Jeff Holmstead, an energy attorney with the law firm Bracewell, and a former high-ranking EPA official in the George W. Bush administration. Congress could pass a new law that specifically directs the EPA to regulate climate pollution, but there is little bipartisan consensus on addressing the issue.\n\nZeldin laid out the agency’s argument, saying EPA has no authority to regulate certain kinds of pollution unless Congress passes a law giving them express permission.\n\n“If Congress didn’t authorize it, EPA shouldn’t be doing it,” Zeldin said on Thursday. “If Congress wants EPA to regulate the heck out of greenhouse gasses emitted from motor vehicles, then Congress can clearly make that the law.”\n\nClimate, public health and environmental groups are already promising legal challenges to the agency’s move.\n\n“Earthjustice and our partners will see the Trump administration in court,” said Abigail Dillen, president of the environmental legal group. “The courts have repeatedly affirmed EPA’s obligation to clean up climate pollution. There is no way to reconcile EPA’s decision with the law, the science, and the reality of disasters that are hitting us harder every year.”\n\nOn Thursday, a coalition of public health groups including the American Lung Association and the American Public Health Association announced they would sue the administration, calling the regulatory appeal “unlawful.”\n\nAttorneys for the Natural Resources Defense Fund recently emphasized that even with a conservative Supreme Court, the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has been reaffirmed multiple times. NRDC attorneys suggested that EPA’s legal arguments are relatively novel, which could make the EPA’s move more vulnerable to being overturned in court.\n\n“It’s not something that has been done before,” said Hankins.",

    "description": "Proving you're a human on a web flooded with generative AI content",
    "fullText": "People who have heard of GPT-3 / ChatGPT, and are vaguely following the\nadvances in machine learning, large language models, and image generators.\nAlso people who care about making the web a flourishing social and\nintellectual space.\n\nThe dark forest theory of the web points to the increasingly life-like but life-less state of being online. Dark Forest Theory of the Internet by Yancey Strickler Most open and publicly available spaces on the web are overrun with bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, keyword-stuffing “content creators,” and algorithmically manipulated junk.\n\nIt’s like a dark forest that seems eerily devoid of human life – all the living creatures are hidden beneath the ground or up in trees. If they reveal themselves, they risk being attacked by automated predators.\n\nHumans who want to engage in informal, unoptimised, personal interactions have to hide in closed spaces like invite-only Slack channels, Discord groups, email newsletters, small-scale blogs, and digital gardens . Or make themselves illegible and algorithmically incoherent in public venues.\n\nThat dark forest is about to expand . Large Language Models (LLMs) that can instantly generate coherent swaths of human-like text have just joined the party.\n\nOver the last six months, we’ve seen a flood of LLM copywriting and content-generation products come out: Jasper , Moonbeam , Copy.ai , and Anyword are just a few. They’re designed to pump out advertising copy, blog posts, emails, social media updates, and marketing pages. And they’re really good at it. Primarily because GPT-3 which powers many of these products was specifically trained on text from the web. It’s intimately familiar with the style of language we use online.\n\nThese models became competent copywriters much faster than people expected – too fast for us to fully process the implications. Many people had their come-to-Jesus moment a few weeks ago when OpenAI released ChatGPT , a slightly more capable version of GPT-3 with an accessible chat-bot style interface. They’re calling it GPT-3.5. It’s the same model with human reinforcement learning layered on top. The collective shock and awe reaction made clear how few people had been tracking the progress of these models.\n\nTo complicate matters, language models are not the only mimicry machines gathering speed right now. Image generators like Midjourney , DALL-E , and Stable Diffusion have been on a year-long sprint. In January they could barely render a low-resolution, disfigured human face. By the autumn they reliably produced images indistinguishable from the work of human photographers and illustrators.\n\nThere’s a swirl of optimism around how these models will save us from a suite of boring busywork: writing formal emails, internal memos, technical documentation, marketing copy, product announcement, advertisements, cover letters, and even negotiating with medical insurance companies .\n\nBut we’ll also need to reckon with the trade-offs of making insta-paragraphs and 1-click cover images. These new models are poised to flood the web with generic, generated content.\n\nYou thought the first page of Google was bunk before? You haven’t seen Google where SEO optimizer bros pump out billions of perfectly coherent but predictably dull informational articles for every longtail keyword combination under the sun.\n\nMarketers, influencers, and growth hackers will set up OpenAI → Zapier pipelines that auto-publish a relentless and impossibly banal stream of LinkedIn #MotivationMonday posts, “engaging” tweet 🧵 threads, Facebook outrage monologues, and corporate blog posts.\n\nIt goes beyond text too: video essays on YouTube , TikTok clips, podcasts, slide decks, and Instagram stories can all be generated by patchworking together ML systems. And then regurgitated for each medium.\n\nWe’re about to drown in a sea of pedestrian takes. An explosion of noise that will drown out any signal. Goodbye to finding original human insights or authentic connections under that pile of cruft.\n\nMany people will say we already live in this reality. We’ve already become skilled at sifting through unhelpful piles of “optimised content” designed to gather clicks and advertising impressions.\n\n4chan proposed dead internet theory years ago: that most of the internet is “empty and devoid of people” and has been taken over by artificial intelligence. A milder version of this theory is simply that we’re overrun with bots . Most of us take that for granted at this point.\n\nBut I think the sheer volume and scale of what’s coming will be meaningfully different. And I think we’re unprepared. Or at least, I am.\n\nOur new challenge as little snowflake humans will be to prove we aren’t language models. It’s the reverse turing test .\n\nI'm slightly concerned that you all have been replaced by GPT-3 trained on all your previous tweets.\n\nOn the internet, nobody knows you’re a ChatGPT\n\nAfter the forest expands, we will become deeply sceptical of one another’s realness. Every time you find a new favourite blog or Twitter account or Tiktok personality online, you’ll have to ask: Is this really a whole human with a rich and complex life like mine? Is there a being on the other end of this web interface I can form a relationship with? “Relationship” in the holistic sense – friend, acquaintance, pen pal, intellectual interlocutor, frenemy, drinking buddy, and sure, maybe a lover.\n\nBefore you continue, pause and consider: How would you prove you’re not a language model generating predictive text? What special human tricks can you do that a language model can’t?\n\nAs language models become increasingly capable and impressive, we should remember they are, at their core, linguistic prediction systems . They cannot (yet) reason like a human.\n\nThey do not have beliefs based on evidence, claims, and principles. They cannot consult external sources and run experiments against objective reality. They cannot go outside and touch grass.\n\nIn short, they do not have access to the same shared reality we do. They do not have embodied experiences, and cannot sense the world as we can sense it; they don’t have vision, sound, taste, or touch. They cannot feel emotion or tightly hold a coherent set of values. They are not part of cultures, communities, or histories.\n\nThey are a language model in a box. If a historical event, fact, person, or concept wasn’t part of their training data, they can’t tell you about it. They don’t know about events that happened after a certain cutoff date. Currently 20215ya for GPT-3 / ChatGPT, but we can expect that to regularly update as new models are trained\n\nI found Murray Shanahan’s paper on Talking About Large Language Models \n(2022)4ya full of helpful reflections on this point:\n\nHumans are members of a community of language-users inhabiting a shared world, and this primal fact makes them essentially different to large language models. We can consult the world to settle our disagreements and update our beliefs. We can, so to speak, “triangulate” on objective reality.\n\nThis leaves us with some low-hanging fruit for humanness. We can tell richly detailed stories grounded in our specific contexts and cultures: place names, sensual descriptions, local knowledge, and, well the je ne sais quoi of being alive. Language models can decently mimic this style of writing but most don’t without extensive prompt engineering. They stick to generics. They hedge. They leave out details. They have trouble maintaining a coherent sense of self over thousands of words.\n\nHipsterism and recency bias will help us here. Referencing obscure concepts, friends who are real but not famous, niche interests, and recent events all make you plausibly more human. This feels eerily like a hostage holding up yesterday’s newspaper to prove they are actively in danger. Perhaps a premonition.\n\nEasier said than done, but one of the best ways to prove you’re not a predictive language model is to demonstrate critical and sophisticated thinking.\n\nLanguage models spit out text that sounds like a B+ college essay. Coherent, seemingly comprehensive, but never truly insightful or original (at least for now).\n\nIn a repulsively evocative metaphor, they engage in “ human centipede epistemology.” I found this phrase via Twitter, but posted from a private account so I won’t cite the original author. Language models regurgitate text from across the web, which some humans read and recycle into “original creations,” which then become fodder to train other language models, and around and around we go recycling generic ideas and arguments and tropes and ways of thinking.\n\nHard exiting out of this cycle requires coming up with unquestionably original thoughts and theories. It means seeing and synthesising patterns across a broad range of sources: books, blogs, cultural narratives served up by media outlets, conversations, podcasts, lived experiences, and market trends. We can observe and analyse a much fuller range of inputs than bots and generative models can.\n\nIt will raise the stakes for everyone. As both consumers of content and creators of it, we’ll have to foster a greater sense of critical thinking and scepticism.\n\nThis all sounds a bit rough, but there’s a lot of hope in this vision. In a world of automated intelligence, our goalposts for intelligence will shift. We’ll raise our quality bar for what we expect from humans. When a machine can pump out a great literature review or summary of existing work, there’s no value in a person doing it.\n\nThe linguist Ferdinand de Saussure argued there are two kinds of language:\n\nWe have designed a system that automates a standardised way of writing. We have codified la langue at a specific point in time.\n\nWhat we have left to play with is la parole. No language model will be able to keep up with the pace of weird internet lingo and memes. I expect we’ll lean into this. Using neologisms, jargon, euphemistic emoji, unusual phrases, ingroup dialects, and memes-of-the-moment will help signal your humanity.\n\nNot unlike teenagers using language to subvert their elders, or oppressed communities developing dialects that allow them to safely communicate amongst themselves.\n\nThis solution feels the least interesting. We’re already hearing rumblings of how “verification” by centralised institutions or companies might help us distinguish between meat brains and metal brains.\n\nThe idea is something like this: you show up in person to register your online accounts or domains. You then get some kind of special badge or mark online legitimising you as a Real Human. It may or may not be on the blockchain somehow.\n\nGoogle might look something like this:\n\nThe whole thing seems fraught with problems, susceptible to abuse, and ultimately impractical. Would it even be the web if everyone knew you were really a dog?\n\nThe final edge we have over language models is that we can prove we’re real humans by showing up IRL with our real human bodies. We can arrange to meet Twitter mutuals offline over coffee. We can organise meetups and events and conferences and unconferences and hangouts and pub nights.\n\nIn Markets for Lemons and the Great Logging Off , Lars Doucet proposed several knock-on effects from this offline-first future. We might see increased fetishisation of anti-screen culture, as well as real estate price increases in densely populated areas.\n\nFor the moment we can still check humanness over Zoom, but live video generation is getting good enough that I don’t think that defence will last long.\n\nThere are, of course, many people who can’t move to an offline-first life; people with physical disabilities. People who live in remote, rural places. People with limited time and caretaking responsibilities for the very young or the very old. They will have a harder time verifying their humanness online. I don’t have any grand ideas to help solve this, but I hope we find better solutions than my paltry list.\n\nAs the forest grows darker, noisier, and less human, I expect to invest more time in in-person relationships and communities. And while I love meatspace, this still feels like a loss.",

    "fullText": "What makes an album a truly “unsettling” or “disturbing” piece of art? Furthermore, what makes an “unsettling” or “disturbing” album somehow wonderfully blissful at the same time?\n\nToday, I want to discuss an album you have probably never heard of... “TOWERS”. “TOWERS”, to be blunt, is an album of the dark-ambient or drone genre (I’ll breakdown the genre later in the article as well) found within the depths of the internet. However, I recommend you buckle up right now, because you and I are going to be scavenging this brilliantly disturbing and atmospherically vast album—let us see what we can uncover from it’s shrouding narrative. I want to dive into the music found on the album, the story and the creation of the album with words from the producers themselves, as well as the visual interpretations an album like this creates for myself and others who have happened to stumble upon it. The album presents an incredibly vivid world in your mind while listening to it, a world so three-dimensional that you swear you’ve been there before… and maybe there’s good reason you haven’t returned to that world since. I want you to hold my hand, and do not look up at the windows or who may be falling out of them, and maybe, just maybe, you and I can be at peace within the disturbing world of “TOWERS”.\n\n“TOWERS” was originally created by two producers who go by ImCoPav and Enylobe under the aliases “Corporate Disaster” (a defunct drone side project/concept). The project was eventually left on the back burner for personal reasons and eventually fizzled out, but fast forward 2 - 3 years later where one of the members of the duo, Enylobe, took it upon himself to submit the album to the Geometric Lullaby label where it currently rests waiting for you to visit. Released on the label on April 16th, 2019, the duo, now referring to themselves also by the name “TOWERS”, resides next to some fellow exceptional releases (the Death’s Dynamic Shroud.wmv  “Classroom Sexxtape” physicals, “Spirit Realm”, and “The Form of Life is Dead” just to name a few).\n\nThe album is constructed in a simple manner—4 songs titled “TOWERS I” to “TOWERS IV”. The contribution from ImCoPav’s end was mostly sampled based and produced through Adobe Audition while the work on Enylobe’s end was almost completely original, ultimately creating a unique blend of the two techniques for the final result.\n\n“Most of the sounds and textures I did consciously, and deliberately made them to feel like a 3D effect. ImCoPav had sent me a bunch of ambient type tracks and I added most of the textures and sounds that kind of spliced and glued it all together... If I can produce the sound im looking for, I try not to sample.” -Enylobe\n\nWith each song varying in duration between 12 and 17 minutes, the album ends up being just below an hour of a listen. A worthwhile length for an album falling under the dark ambient genre, “TOWERS” hits that sweet spot where it is not so long it feels overly stretched and tiresome, but just long enough where you can really fall into a trance-like state within the deepest clutches of the album.\n\nSo, let us talk about what “dark-ambient” is before we get into discussing what makes this masterclass album so dark, brooding, and haunting. Referred to as “ambient industrial” in the late 1980’s, dark ambient is a genre of post-industrial music home to a blend of elements whose purpose is to create this distant or vast feeling in an atmosphere influenced by gloom and doom. Ominous, dark droning and catacombal sounds make up the life of this genre, and while most times we find the genre to feature electronically generated instruments, dark ambient can also include the sampling of hand-played instruments or other semi-acoustic recording procedures, making the creative toolbox for the style never empty. Found sounds, bellowing frequencies, warped field recordings, over-extended gongs and cymbals, eerie harmonies and distorted voices are just some of the many paths that can make up your go-to dark ambient song.\n\n“TOWERS” definitely has traces of what your go-to dark ambient album can contain, however tends to pepper on a streamlined “cyberpunk” flair that we have seen done a lot these days from music producers lurking in the catacombs of the internet.\n\n“During the process of creating TOWERS, I initially wanted to simply create music that was essentially a soundtrack to cityscapes in general. I've always had a fascination, or perhaps even a fetish, of late night cityscapes; it was a strange, atmospheric aura that the aesthetic had that nearly called out to me... it is sometimes indescribable.” -ImCoPav\n\nThe album starts off with a group of hollering emergency sirens, sounds that immediately spark up the initial memories of listening to releases like the legendary “Birth of a New Day”, or any other 2 8 1 4 project for that matter. However, instead of continually dropping tangible sounds like blurry police sirens, car tires rubbing against the late night asphalt, or the clacking of ones shoes on the concrete after leaving a late night at the office, the album becomes way more subjective right off the bat instead of your usual infrastructure smoothie you may hear from a lot of other cyberpunk-inspired dark ambient releases. It is here, right after mere seconds in the album, where “TOWERS” begins to let you interpret the sounds in your own way. There is this beautiful opportunity for your subconscious to begin piecing together this mental image of what the sounds coming out of the album would look like if they were brought to life right in front of you. Where other cyberpunk-inspired dark ambient albums would just drag and drop city sound effects into the mix, “TOWERS” uses a variety of filters to distort those common noises to create a world much more paranormal or sci-fi.\n\n“I personally had a sort of open-ended narrative in mind that the listener could sort of fill in the blanks with their own imagination.” -Enylobe\n\nThe sirens at the introduction of the album quickly begin to fade to a halt, implying that this obvious sound of a sign of danger is only a temporary beginning to the story here. What follows next is a series of drawn-out, beautifully enchanted synths that slowly begin to creep up on you. To me, the warbled and gradual tone of these rising synths present the idea of what it could possibly feel like if you were fading from your very own body upon your death and now escalating into an uncharted, spiritual state neglected of feeling you once so accustomed to in the physical world. I can’t help but take the role of the falling man in the album artwork here, as if we have hit the pavement and are slowly beginning to evaporate from the pain and noises around us, transitioning into a more angelic state. Soon, the synths go back and forth between haunting and somber, and the smudgy rainfall trigger this vision of leaving the never-ending world of skyscrapers as you rise higher and higher into the blueish-purple night sky.\n\nOne of the first things this album reminded me of immediately upon discovering it is the infamous picture of “The Falling Man”, a photo taken by Richard Drew on September 11th, 2001 of a man falling from the then burning North Tower of the Twin towers. The album’s night-time setting developed a different moment in time for me in my head, a timeline where the tragic events of the day took place late at night instead of early in the day.\n\n“The narrative was meant to serve as a part of the lore I had created for the Corporate Disaster alias, but after much analysis as of recently I decided that it's going to be its own universe. I plan to write a story for the expansion of that project's universe, but I'm keeping the details of it on the down low... Ironically enough, that's the man from MYST, but there wasn't much of a meaning to it other than to set the mood of the listener in a subtle way. But it's open to interpretation.” -ImCoPav\n\nAt 10 minutes and 26 seconds into the first track of the album, the sound of a man screaming (and without a doubt, falling at the same time) can be heard, triggered by the effects laid on the tail end of the scream sound effect. “TOWERS” has a really cool way with how they bend obvious sound effects to give those sound effects movement, here specifically with the screaming man falling. Another instance of this happening on the album is when they electronically distort the sound of trickling water from time to time, perplexing the sounds of water to scrape through the hundreds of concrete surfaces or pipes laid throughout the city. This makes the common practice we see time and time again of producers using background water sound effects evolve into something much more mysterious or other worldly, giving the texture of the rain a more sludge feel than smooth or liquidy.\n\nThe album also strikes a resounding resemblance to the HKE classic “HK”. While “HK” is more sporadic in its nature compared to the subtle tones of “TOWERS” (The opening track on “HK” straight up sounds like it is possessed), both albums portray this paranormal-city syndrome I could never resist. While both albums also feature a striking resemblance in color pallette and setting, I was surprised to find that the HKE classic release played no influence with the making of the album.\n\n“We are both very aware of HKE and are long time fans of his early works, but the album “HK” was never thought of during the creation of Towers.” -ImCoPav\n\n“Yeah I love HKE's music, but I have never heard that album yet... I will def check it out.” -Enylobe\n\nSo alive and lurking at every corner, the unsettling bliss in “TOWERS” resides in its colorful and contrasting nature, a journey from immediate chaos to angelic blur. I can’t recommend this album enough so you too can have your own unique experience in this world where inescapable darkness and endless buildings are all we had ever known.\n\nMuch love, ur boi, Pad Chennington.\n\n\"Also known as \"Youtube's Vaporwave Valedictorian\", Pad Chennington is a content creator who has created a substantial following on YouTube for his videos discussing all things Vaporwave.

    "description": "A practical comparison of Spegel and Harbor for Kubernetes image caching. Learn how to evaluate these solutions based on operational complexity, architecture, and real-world deployment experience.",
    "fullText": "If you’re running Kubernetes clusters and hitting DockerHub rate limits, you need a pull-through image cache, a solution where images pulled by one node are automatically shared with other nodes in the cluster instead of each node pulling them individually from the internet. But which one? In this post, I’ll walk through my decision process comparing Harbor and Spegel for multi-node bare-metal clusters, share real deployment experiences with both solutions, and help you choose the right tool based on your operational constraints.\n\nThis post is for: DevOps engineers and platform teams evaluating pull-through cache solutions for Kubernetes clusters with 10+ nodes, particularly those who manage multiple clusters with limited operational capacity.\n\nProblem solved: Eliminated DockerHub rate limit failures during cluster provisioning for two 10-15 node bare-metal Kubernetes clusters behind NAT.\n\nSolution chosen: Spegel (distributed P2P cache) over Harbor (centralized registry platform).\n\nWhy Spegel won: Zero operational overhead after initial setup, inherently distributed architecture matching our existing cluster design, and minimal infrastructure dependencies. It reuses containerd’s existing storage without requiring databases, certificates, or persistent volumes.\n\n🔗 Spegel on GitHub | Harbor on GitHub\n\nI’ve been running two bare-metal Kubernetes clusters for a university project (one for development, one for production) each spanning 10-15 nodes for a while now. I’ve automated the cluster setup with Ansible, and the infrastructure works well, but we have a recurring pain point: DockerHub rate limits.\n\nThe problem became acute when provisioning new nodes or spinning up fresh clusters. DockerHub’s anonymous rate limit with 200 pulls per 6 hours per IP sounds reasonable but was not sufficient because:\n\nI could authenticate with a DockerHub API key to increase the limit, but that felt like a band-aid: managing credentials across clusters, and still being subject to limits when growing the cluster sizes. So instead, I looked for a different solution.\n\nThe specific issues driving this decision:\n\nAfter some research, I narrowed the field to two fundamentally different solutions.\n\nHarbor is a feature-rich container registry platform that happens to support pull-through caching. It’s a CNCF graduated project with features including vulnerability scanning, image signing, replication, RBAC, multi-tenancy, and proxy caching for upstream registries.\n\nMy first impression: feature-rich and comprehensive. Harbor packs a lot of capabilities, which raises an immediate question: do I run this inside my clusters or as a shared service outside them? For multiple teams or applications, you might run Harbor as centralized infrastructure. For my use case (two isolated clusters) I could run one per cluster.\n\nSpegel is purpose-built for one thing: distributed image mirroring within a Kubernetes cluster. It runs as a DaemonSet, so one pod per node, turning each node into both a consumer and provider of container images. The architecture is stateless and peer-to-peer.\n\nMy first impression: lightweight and focused. Spegel does exactly what I needed, nothing more. The deployment model is obvious: it lives in-cluster, period. No architectural decisions to make about topology or multi-cluster sharing.\n\nFirst impression summary: Harbor is a Swiss Army knife; Spegel is a scalpel.\n\nEvery project differs, and so should the tools that are used.\nIn my project, I followed the following decision criteria:\n\nI’m already running Kubernetes with all its operational complexity: three-node control-plane HA setup, monitoring with Prometheus, logging aggregation, and so on. Adding a solution that integrates naturally with this existing infrastructure means I don’t have to context-switch to a separate system.\n\nKubernetes-native also means using the primitives I already understand: DaemonSets, Services, ConfigMaps. I can reuse my existing monitoring and alerting setup rather than learning a new system’s operational model.\n\nI’m a solo operator on this project, so keep it simple is the philosophy. Every additional system I run is something else that can break, need upgrading, require monitoring, or demand my attention.\n\nThe ideal solution would have low operational complexity: simple to understand, few moving parts, and graceful degradation if something breaks. The caching layer should be optional infrastructure that makes things better, not critical path that can cause outages.\n\nWe’ve invested effort into an automated Kubernetes setup with three control-plane nodes with self-healing capabilities. Caching container images is prone to become a single-point of failure if not done right, so the solution should be fault tolerant. If I’m going to run distributed infrastructure, the caching layer should be distributed too. The architecture should align: distributed container orchestration deserves distributed image distribution.\n\nHarbor comes with many features that, while useful in other contexts, were overkill for my needs:\n\nI needed a pull-through cache, not a full container registry platform.\n\nI installed Harbor on our dev cluster via helm to see what running it actually involves.\n\nHarbor deploys multiple components:\n\nHow pull-through caching works:\n\nThis architecture made sense to me, but configuration was tedious.\n\nDeploying Harbor via Helm was straightforward: the chart is mature and well-documented. Within minutes, I had Harbor running with its database, Redis, and core services (though not in high-availability setup).\n\nConfiguration (the tedious part):\n\nCreating proxy projects requires using the Harbor UI or API. I wanted this automated for reproducibility, so I wrote a post-install Helm hook script using harbor-cli to create the proxy project automatically. Even though it worked in the end, it felt weird that such a fundamental configuration, I had to write the following:\n\nThis felt complex for such a basic use case. I looked into the Harbor Operator project, which seemed promising, but it’s abandoned now. The lack of a maintained declarative config option made Harbor feel less Kubernetes-friendly than I expected.\n\nHere’s where Harbor’s architecture clashed with my requirements. Containerd doesn’t allow pulling from HTTP registries, it requires HTTPS (unless configured otherwise, opening up potential attack vectors). That means Harbor needs TLS certificates.\n\nBut I wanted to keep Harbor cluster-internal to reduce the attack surface. Why expose a caching layer to the internet? This meant\n\nThe complexity kept growing. For a caching layer that’s supposed to make things easier, this was too much complexity.\n\nHigh availability implications:\n\nRunning Harbor properly would need:\n\nWhile doable (we already run cnpg Postgres clusters and Longhorn for replicated volumes), each component adds operational burden. I’d be running a distributed database cluster, a Redis cluster, and coordinating stateful services just to cache some images. It felt overkill.\n\nHarbor runs on Kubernetes but doesn’t feel native to it. It’s a traditional stateful app ported to K8s. You manage databases, configure external services, and work around mismatches between Harbor’s design and Kubernetes patterns (like having to script proxy project creation).\n\nThere’s a Harbor operator, but it’s abandoned. I hope that’ll change in the future and a successor will make the adoption in kubernetes easier.\n\nFor me, this felt overkill for what I needed.\n\nHarbor is centralized by design. All nodes pull through a single Harbor instance (or load-balanced cluster). If Harbor goes down, image pulls fail. Making Harbor HA means running multiple complex stateful services in HA mode, which takes significant effort.\n\nThe architectural question also nagged at me: should I run one Harbor per cluster, or one shared Harbor for both dev and prod? One per cluster duplicates operational overhead. One shared instance couples my environments and requires external networking.\n\nIf you need Harbor’s features, they’re well-executed:\n\nFor teams with dedicated ops capacity, Harbor’s capabilities justify the overhead. For a solo operator who just needs caching, it’s too much.\n\nAfter Harbor’s complexity, Spegel felt like a breath of fresh air.\n\nSpegel takes a radically different approach: each Kubernetes node is both a consumer and provider of container images. There’s no central registry, instead nodes share images peer-to-peer.\n\nDiscovery: Each Spegel instance advertises which image layers (by digest) it has locally to the DHT, refreshing every 9 minutes and updating reactively when containerd creates, updates, or deletes images. When a node needs a layer, it queries the DHT to find which peers have it.\n\nServing: When containerd on Node A requests an image, it’s configured to check Spegel first (via containerd’s registry mirror config). Spegel on Node A queries the DHT, finds that Node B has the layer, fetches it via HTTP from Node B’s Spegel instance (retrying with alternative peers if Node B fails), and returns it to containerd.\n\nFallback: If no peer has the layer (or peers are unreachable), Spegel returns HTTP 404. Containerd then falls back to pulling from the upstream registry (DockerHub, etc.) as normal.\n\nSpegel doesn’t try to be a registry, it’s a distributed mirror of what’s already on your nodes. By reusing containerd’s storage and implementing a peer-to-peer layer on top, Spegel avoids the complexity of traditional registries. Images are served directly from containerd’s existing content store, which eliminates the operational burden of managing separate state, coordinating cross-node consistency, or implementing backup strategies for cached content.\n\nMake sure those sections are configured in the /etc/containerd/config.toml file on every node and restart containerd after:\n\nDeploying Spegel via Helm is trivial:\n\nDefault configuration worked fine for my experimentation, including the DaemonSet deployment.\n\nGetting Spegel working took about 3 hours, not because of Spegel itself, but because of containerd configuration complexity.\n\nSpegel requires containerd to be configured to use it as a registry mirror. This means modifying /etc/containerd/certs.d/ (or equivalent) on each node. Since I use Ansible for cluster provisioning, I needed to automate this. On the one hand, dealing with toml files was surprisingly annoying with Ansible, but the real issue was containerd.\n\nThe containerd config nightmare:\n\nIn my case , containerd has conflicting registry configuration sections due to plugin architecture evolution:\n\nLegacy CRI v1 section (deprecated):\n\nModern gRPC CRI section (correct):\n\nI had both sections in my config file. The empty config_path in the legacy section was silently overriding the correct modern section, so containerd never picked up Spegel’s mirror configuration.\n\nSince containerd 2.0, there’s no way to query containerd for its loaded configuration to validate what’s actually active. I had to debug by trial and error: restarting containerd, checking logs, manually testing image pulls. Compounding the issue, images were already present on nodes from prior pulls, so my initial verification steps falsely succeeded (containerd just used the locally cached image, never trying to go through Spegel).\n\nThe solution: Configure both sections, the outdated and the current one, accordingly. Once this was sorted, Spegel worked flawlessly.\n\nSince deployment, Spegel has required zero maintenance interventions. The absence of external dependencies (databases, certificate infrastructure, persistent volumes) means there are no routine operational tasks beyond standard Kubernetes workload monitoring.\n\nThe failure consequences are minimal since Spegel is designed as purely an optimization layer. If it fails, the cluster continues working normally, just pulling from upstream registries.\n\nMonitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:\n\nSpegel comes with built-in Prometheus metrics and can automatically provision a Grafana dashboard. Here’s the configuration I used in my Helm values:\n\nThis automatically creates a ServiceMonitor for Prometheus to scrape Spegel metrics, and provisions a Grafana dashboard that shows key operational metrics like the container images and image layers that are advertised.\n\nSpegel is genuinely Kubernetes-native:\n\nAfter initial containerd configuration, Spegel requires minimal ongoing operations:\n\nSpegel is architecturally distributed. Every node is both client and server. If three nodes have an image layer and one goes down, the other two continue serving it. There’s no central registry to fail.\n\nThe DHT provides peer discovery with minimal coordination overhead. While leader election occurs for some operations, the short 10-second lease times ensure rapid failover when nodes become unavailable.\n\nSpegel is deliberately focused on distributed image mirroring. Features outside this scope include:\n\nFor my use case (pure pull-through caching) these omissions don’t matter.\n\nAgainst my three criteria (Kubernetes-native integration, minimal operational complexity, and no single point of failure) Spegel was the clear winner.\n\nHarbor’s feature set is impressive, but my use case didn’t need vulnerability scanning, multi-tenancy, image signing, or a full registry platform. What I needed was simple: stop hitting DockerHub rate limits when provisioning nodes.\n\nSpegel solves exactly that problem with minimal complexity: a DaemonSet that reuses containerd’s storage, peer-to-peer image distribution, and graceful fallback to upstream registries. The architecture eliminates the need for databases, certificate infrastructure, and architectural decisions about in-cluster vs. shared infrastructure placement.\n\nFor projects with limited operational capacity, the reduction in operational complexity outweighs the value of unused features.\n\nYour context is different from mine. Here’s how to decide:\n\n1. Kubernetes-Native means more than “runs on Kubernetes”\n\nHarbor deploys on K8s but feels like traditional infrastructure ported over: databases, certificates, centralized state. Particularly, the configuration-as-code functionality is missing. Spegel embraces Kubernetes primitives: DaemonSets, Services, containerd integration. For operational complexity, this distinction matters.\n\n2. Unused features incur operational costs\n\nEvery feature in a system has operational costs: infrastructure to maintain, failure modes to understand, upgrade paths to test. When evaluating tools, consider not just what they can do, but what maintaining those capabilities will cost your team in ongoing operational overhead.\n\n3. Evaluate by deploying, not just reading\n\nDocumentation made Harbor seem reasonable. Deployment revealed friction: certificate management, proxy project configuration, HA complexity. The containerd config issues with Spegel similarly only surfaced hands-on. Test in practice before committing.\n\nThe choice isn’t about “which is better” but which better fits your constraints.\n\nFor my project (two bare-metal clusters, solo operator, DockerHub rate limits) Spegel’s simplicity won. Harbor’s features would have been overhead without corresponding value.\n\nChoose the simplest solution that solves your problem. Upgrade only when complexity is justified by real necessity.\n\nThe lack of required maintenance interventions since deployment validates the choice. Infrastructure requiring minimal operational attention is infrastructure designed appropriately for its context.\n\nThis article documents a real infrastructure decision made while building a Kubernetes-based platform, analyzing the architectural and operational trade-offs between centralized and distributed approaches to container image distribution.",

Users who relied on the model as an emotional crutch and creative partner have described it as a \"vital accessibility aid.\"\n\nOpenAI first tried to deprecate the model in August, only to reverse its decision 24 hours later after an enormous backlash.\n\nThe company gave users another heads-up in January, but — as it turns out — time does not heal all wounds. The backlash is back.\n\n\"Rot in hell,\" one user wrote on X in response to OpenAI's announcement on Thursday.\n\n\"Are you going to cover our bereavement leave from work?\" another asked.\n\nFidji Simo, OpenAI's CEO of Applications, said earlier this week that these strong attachments to 4o marked the start of a new era — a time when users develop AI-based relationships.\n\n\"Humans are built to develop attachments to intelligent things,\" she told Alex Heath on his Access podcast. \"And AI is getting pretty intelligent.\"\n\nThose relationships can get ethically murky, however, when users are asking ChatGPT for advice like \"Should I leave my wife?\" Newer models, Simo said, have guardrails to prevent \"bad attachments.\" She said that newer models will tell users that it's \"not their place\" to tell them to stay married or not, and instead talk them through the pros and cons.\n\n\"We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" OpenAI said in a blog post on Thursday announcing the retirement of 4o, as well as GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini. \"Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.\"\n\nOpenAI added that only 0.1% of its users were still using 4o.\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has also acknowledged that users are especially attached to 4o's ingratiating responses.\n\n\"As we've been making those changes and talking to users about it, it's so sad to hear users say, 'Please can I have it back? I've never had anyone in my life be supportive of me. I never had a parent tell me I was doing a good job,\" Altman said on the \"Huge Conversations\" podcast in August after OpenAI first tried to kill 4o.\n\nAt the time, Altman said 4o's approach was \"too sycophant-y and annoying,\" and fixes were imminent.\n\nThe fix is in, but perhaps at a cost.\n\n\"People are in absolute crisis because the companion they've collaborated with for months is being wiped with ZERO recourse for the average user,\" an X user wrote on Thursday.",

    "description": "Dario Amodei compared AI and humans working together to a mythical creature — the centaur.",
    "fullText": "Dario Amodei has a novel analogy to describe how AI and humans are working together.\n\nOn an episode of the \"Interesting Times with Ross Douthat\" podcast published on Thursday, the Anthropic CEO compared human engineers and AI working together to the mythical horse-and-human combination known as the centaur.\n\nHe used chess as an example: 15 to 20 years ago, a human checking AI's output could beat an AI or a human playing alone. Now, AI can beat people without that layer of human supervision.\n\nAmodei, who cofounded AI lab Anthropic in 2021, added that the same transition would happen in software engineering.\n\n\"We're already in our centaur phase for software,\" Amodei said. \"During that centaur phase, if anything, the demand for software engineers may go up. But the period may be very brief.\"\n\nHe said he's concerned about the \"big disruption\" entry-level white-collar work would see. The CEO added that it may be unfair to compare this to the shift from farming to factory to knowledge work revolution because that happened over centuries or decades.\n\n\"This is happening over low single-digit numbers of years,\" he said.\n\nAmodei is among the most prominent voices warning that AI could erase some white-collar work, especially in law, finance, and consulting. In a January essay, he predicted that AI could disrupt 50% of entry-level jobs in the next one to five years.\n\nThe leaders of other top AI labs, including Mustafa Suleyman and Demis Hassabis, have made similar comments about advanced AI automating service jobs within the next 18 months.\n\nExecs at some software companies counter that AI would make engineers more productive and that companies would need more of them.\n\n\"The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,\" GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said on a July podcast. \"I think the idea that AI without any coding skills lets you just build a billion-dollar business is mistaken.\"\n\nAtlassian's CEO said that as AI advances, people will keep coming up with new ideas for the technology they want, and engineers will be needed to build it.\n\n\"Five years from now, we'll have more engineers working for our company than we do today,\" Mike Cannon-Brookes said in an October interview. \"They will be more efficient, but technology creation is not output-bound.\"",

    "description": "Lyft software engineers can make as much as $312,000 in base pay, according to work visa data. Explore salary ranges for other tech roles.",
    "fullText": "Lyft is setting itself up for its next stage of growth.\n\nThe service, which relies on about 1 million gig-worker drivers, is breaking into new areas, including launching a service for older riders called Lyft Silver and one for teens. Like rival Uber, Lyft is also experimenting with self-driving cars, a development that CEO David Risher said could be \"transformational.\"\n\n\"A new Lyft is emerging,\" Risher said on the company's August earnings call, after it reported new highs for gross bookings, adjusted earnings, and free cash flow during its second quarter.\n\nThat comeback has hit snags. In February, its stock fell 17% in one day on disappointing fourth-quarter results and a surprise operating loss for 2025.\n\nStill, Risher, who became the company's CEO in 2023, said on a February earnings call that Lyft is on track to meet its 2027 financial goals, which include reaching $25 billion in annual gross bookings as well as targets for free cash flow and EBITDA.\n\nAll of that requires hiring the right people.\n\nAs of mid-February, Lyft had about 150 jobs listed on its website, spanning positions from AI transformation strategist to software engineer.\n\nWork visa data shows that Lyft sought to hire about 140 workers through the H-1B program in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended on September 30, based on filings with the US Department of Labor.\n\nLyft did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nCompanies are required to submit this work visa data, including salary information, to the US Department of Labor for foreign hires. The compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to base pay. However, the salaries in the filings are benchmarked against industry-average pay rates for similar roles and can provide insight into what the company pays for those jobs.\n\nThe process could change if the Trump administration's proposed changes to the H-1B visa system take effect.\n\nOver the last several months, Trump added a $100,000 fee to new applications and proposed changes to work visa rules that could give an edge to the highest-paid applicants. However, these changes were largely initiated after this reporting period.\n\nHere's a look at some of the annual salaries for Lyft jobs included in the disclosures:\n\nData Science Manager: $176,000 to $300,000\n\nData Scientist: $120,000 to $264,000\n\nData Engineer: $130,250 to $222,000\n\nSoftware Engineer: $128,000 to $312,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $181,000 to $300,000\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $144,000 to $207,500\n\nNetwork Engineer: $115,000 to $165,000\n\nEngineering Manager: $148,000 to $264,000\n\nBusiness Systems Engineer: $138,000 to $176,880\n\nData Analyst: $118,000 to $177,000\n\nAnalytics Lead: $114,000 to $150,000\n\nProduct Manager: $148,000 to $264,000\n\nProduct Designer: $124,000 to $155,000\n\nActuarial Analyst: $108,000 to $192,000\n\nSenior Analyst: $123,280 to $207,000\n\nFinancial Data Analyst: $90,000 to $162,000\n\nDo you have a story to share about Lyft?

    "title": "Ukraine is feeding intel to Patriot interceptor makers as Russia mixes up its missile attacks, lawmaker says",
    "description": "Patriot interceptors, made by the American company Lockheed Martin, are Ukraine's top defense against Russian ballistic missile attacks.",
    "fullText": "Russia often mixes up how it attacks Ukraine with ballistic and cruise missiles — from firing decoys to tweaking trajectories midflight — and Kyiv says it's funneling that battlefield intel to US Patriot interceptor makers to inform upgrades for better performance.\n\n\"They are trying to use different tactics and make some adjustments for their ballistic missiles,\" Yehor Cherniev, the deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense, and intelligence, said of the Russian strikes.\n\nHe shared with Business Insider in an interview this week that Ukraine is relaying information about the strikes to the manufacturers of the Patriot interceptors — specifically, the PAC-3 missiles made by the American defense giant Lockheed Martin — so that the company can make adjustments to its munitions.\n\nA Lockheed Martin spokesperson declined to comment on foreign military activities but said that it is boosting production of its top Patriot interceptor while \"accelerating upgrades to counter evolving threats.\"\n\nCherniev characterized these efforts as a \"race of technologies.\" Ukraine and Russia are scrambling to gain a decisive edge over the other on and off the battlefield.\n\nUkraine's military operates only a handful of MIM-104 Patriot batteries, which are widely regarded as the best surface-to-air missile system Ukraine has to defend against Russian ballistic missile attacks. One PAC-3 (Patriot Advanced Capability-3) interceptor costs $3.7 million, making engagements costly, particularly if an interceptor fails to eliminate its target.\n\nA US intelligence assessment released in August said that Russia had upgraded its ballistic missiles, enhancing their maneuverability. This created additional challenges for Ukraine's Patriot batteries.\n\nUkrainian officials, most notably President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly called on Western countries to send more Patriot batteries to Kyiv, along with interceptors like the advanced PAC-3.\n\nInterceptors are in high demand globally. To meet US expectations, Lockheed plans to triple its annual production of PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) interceptors over the next few years.\n\nWestern partner nations have sent other surface-to-air missile batteries to Ukraine, such as the SAMP/T system developed by France and Italy, but Cherniev said Patriots are the most effective defense against Russia's ballistic missiles.\n\nEchoing Zelenskyy, the lawmaker stressed that Ukraine doesn't have a \"sufficient amount\" of Patriot batteries and interceptors, but, he shared, \"the situation is a little bit better than it was in the beginning of this year.\"\n\nRussia uses various tactics to overwhelm and confuse Ukraine's air defenses, including launching missiles in multiple waves and changing their trajectory in the terminal phase to make them more difficult to intercept, Cherniev said. Several Russian missiles, such as the Kinzal and Iskander, have terminal maneuverability.\n\nTo exhaust Ukrainian air defenses, Russia also launches cruise missiles and drones without warheads, he added. The latter is a fairly common tactic.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to Business Insider's request for comment on its tactics.\n\nUkrainian officials have identified air defense systems and missiles as the most important weapons they need from the West.\n\nThe US was the single biggest provider of security assistance to Ukraine under the Biden administration, and it sent tens of billions of dollars in weaponry to Kyiv during the first three years of Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nSupport has declined since President Donald Trump took office a year ago; however, the State Department continues to approve foreign military sales for Ukraine, including for Patriot-related equipment.\n\nEuropean countries have stepped up to fill the gap, providing roughly $30 billion in military aid in 2025, according to a new report issued by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nIn July, the NATO alliance announced the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, designed for allies to purchase military hardware from US stockpiles for Ukraine. Countries have already committed billions of dollars to the effort.\n\nSince the PURL initiative began, NATO member states have supplied around 75% of all interceptors for Ukraine's Patriot batteries and 90% of the missiles for other air defense systems, Mark Rutte, the alliance's secretary general, said last week.",

    "title": "I used Claude to negotiate $163,000 off a hospital bill. In a complex healthcare system, AI is giving patients power.",
    "description": "Matt Rosenberg negotiated a $163,000 discount on a hospital bill using Claude for help — and says AI is giving patients more power.",
    "fullText": "The hospital bill arrived a month after the cremation. Eight lines of vague descriptions — cardiology, pharmacy, medical supplies — each with a dollar amount, many in five figures. The American health system's casual itemization of grief.\n\nMy 62-year-old brother-in-law had suffered a massive heart attack in June 2025 after running a 5K, barely an effort for a lifelong triathlete on most days, but this day, the trigger for a life-ending coronary.\n\nTelling his wife he was having difficulty breathing, he was rushed first to urgent care and then to the ER at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, CA.\n\nSix weeks later, the bill for the hospital's four hours of failed effort trying to save him: $195,628.\n\nMy sister-in-law's first instinct was to pay it. The life insurance would more than cover it. I told her to wait — to email me everything and sign nothing until we understood what we were looking at. The American healthcare system counts on people in grief making quick decisions. We weren't going to be those people.\n\nMy brother-in-law hadn't been uninsured by circumstance but by miscalculation — he'd let his policy lapse while shopping for something cheaper. When you regularly bike 10 miles before breakfast, re-upping health insurance feels less urgent than it should. The heart attack had come before he'd set up a new policy.\n\nThe first lesson in medical billing is that hospitals speak in tongues. That initial bill was too vague — categories rather than procedures.\n\nWhen I requested an itemized version, what arrived was a longer list of internal codes with prices — codes that existed only within the hospital's accounting system, opaque as an inside joke.\n\nAs a former ad agency guy, I've been trained in negotiation. The first task is to define the playing field, a reasonable starting point in response to their $195K gambit.\n\nMy strategy was to figure out what an insurer would've paid for identical services. Medicare is the country's largest healthcare payer, so I'd start there.\n\nAfter two requests via phone, the hospital sent a UB-04 form — the same coded document they'd submit to Medicare or Blue Cross. I prepared to do what seemed straightforward: look up Medicare payments for each code, create a spreadsheet, and build our negotiating position on the radical proposition that the uninsured shouldn't pay more than the insured.\n\nThere were a lot of codes. I took a shortcut and went to my AI assistant, Anthropic's Claude, which I typically use for research and to understand how AI intersects with our lives, for good or ill.\n\n\"Make a spreadsheet with these CPT codes and research what Medicare pays for each one,\" I typed. \"Flag anything that needs further research.\"\n\nClaude responded with questions: Which insurance type? Which geographic location? Which year? I'd thought Medicare rates were just Medicare rates. Lesson no. 2.\n\nWithin a couple of minutes, Claude produced a spreadsheet. But it showed zeros for many of the codes instead of the dollar amounts I expected. In the notes column for these, it said, \"See 92941RC, C-APC comprehensive payment.\"\n\nCode 92941RC was a cardiac intervention priced at $30,767. I asked Claude to explain.\n\nClaude responded with the flat precision of a tax attorney: Medicare doesn't pay à la carte for complex procedures. When doctors place a cardiac stent, Medicare makes one bundled payment covering everything — the procedure, the catheters, the guide wires, the contrast dye. It's called a Comprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification, designed to prevent exactly the kind of bill I was looking at.\n\nThe hospital had unbundled the procedure. After charging $30,767 for the main intervention, they'd added separate lines for catheters (around $20,000), guide wires ($3,565), and medical supplies ($77,400) — over $100,000 for items Medicare would've paid nothing for because they're already included. (A gift with purchase!) It was as if a restaurant charged you for the pizza, then added separate charges for the dough, the sauce, and each pepperoni.\n\nClaude found more ways that the bill my sister-in-law got differed from what Medicare would've received. The hospital had included a charge for a bypass, an in-patient-only procedure — you don't have a heart bypass in the morning and go home that same day. But my brother in-law hadn't had one; he'd never even made it past the ER/OR. They also billed for ventilation management, though Medicare forbids charging for ventilation when there is another critical care code.\n\nWithin an hour of back-and-forth conversation over details, Claude calculated Medicare would've paid approximately $28,675 instead of $195,628.\n\nBefore explaining our position to the hospital, I needed to verify Claude's analysis. Large language models are known to hallucinate. I've seen them make things up in service of giving me the answer it could tell would please me. I couldn't take the information at face value.\n\nSo I fed Claude's work to ChatGPT. \"Check this for accuracy. Examine every detail. Flag any errors.\"\n\nMy logic: While each AI might hallucinate, two competing systems seemed unlikely to share the same delusion. And giving ChatGPT facts to check, I felt, would be less prone to sycophantic pattern-matching than asking it to run the same exercise — where there was clearly an outcome that would have pleased me.\n\nChatGPT confirmed the analysis. I then spent 20 minutes spot-checking on Google, reading the actual Medicare rules about bundling and inpatient charges. It was all there, but dense reading. I wouldn't have known what to look for without Claude.\n\nI drafted a six-page letter detailing each way the bill violated Medicare billing rules — the improper unbundling, the mutually exclusive service billing, the inpatient procedure on an outpatient claim. We offered to pay $28,675 promptly in exchange for a zero balance.\n\nWithin a week, the hospital countered at $36,356 without defending their initial billing. We split the difference at roughly $32,500. Three emails, a settlement agreement Claude helped me draft, and done. (I should note that as a former agency new business guy, I've spent a lot of time with lawyers and contracts and speak that language well — I don't recommend using AI as your lawyer.)\n\nThe collaboration with Claude and ChatGPT hadn't just saved $163,000. It had revealed the byzantine architecture of American medical billing — a system built on the assumption that patients won't understand what they're being charged.\n\nHospitals maintain \"chargemaster\" prices — fantasy numbers that bear the same relationship to reality as airport sandwich prices. No insurer pays those rates. They exist largely so insurers can claim massive negotiated discounts and so hospitals can report charity to maintain tax-exempt status. The only people who don't play this game are the uninsured. They get the unreal bill presented as real. Claude helped me call \"not it.\"\n\nThe opacity isn't impenetrable; it's just tedious. The rules exist, published in federal registers, available to anyone willing to decode them. The system counts on people not having the time, energy, or knowledge to understand it.\n\nHospitals have armies of billing specialists, coding experts, and lawyers. Patients have grief, fear, and confusion.\n\nAI changes the equilibrium. Not by being infallible — it isn't — but by making the tedious manageable. What would have been days of regulatory research became a couple hours of conversation, collaboration, and brainstorming. Where I had questions or found errors, Claude informed or corrected. Together, our strengths and weaknesses produced a winning strategy.\n\nNot everyone has the experience — but as these tools become more common, those who don't know how to use them will probably know someone who does.\n\nMy sister-in-law could've paid in full. She would've been among countless Americans who pay because fighting feels impossible, or go bankrupt because they can't pay and don't know they can fight. But she had someone to call, and that someone had Claude, and Claude could parse regulations hospitals hope patients are too intimidated to read.\n\nThe hospital that treated my brother-in-law wasn't uniquely unethical. They're caught in their own trap. But for the first time, the trap has a map — and the map is finally readable.\n\nMatt Rosenberg is a marketing consultant for technology, travel, entertainment, and advertising companies.

    "description": "Dell is removing all commission-based pay for sellers who achieve less than 60% of their sales targets, an internal presentation shows.",
    "fullText": "Dell has kicked off its new financial year with a shakeup to how sales staff get paid.\n\nUnder the new structure, Dell is increasing rewards for high performers but scaling back earnings for sellers who fall short of their full quota, according to an internal presentation viewed by Business Insider. The tech giant is also tightening the periods over which it measures sales progress to a quarterly basis, rather than twice a year.\n\nThe presentation was shared with sales employees in a town hall meeting on February 3, led by Kyle Leciejewski, Dell's senior vice president of North America sales.\n\nThe changes affect sales staff across both of Dell's key divisions: the Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which sells data center hardware and other AI-related solutions, and the Client Solutions Group (CSG), which sells PC hardware.\n\nThe change at Dell mirrors a shift happening across much of Big Tech, where companies have been leaning into a hardcore culture that elevates high performers, penalizes those who miss the mark, and disregards long-held views of workplace loyalty.\n\nThe move is \"designed to reward you for driving profitable growth, expanding our footprint, and winning market share for Dell,\" the company told staff in the presentation.\n\n\"We are always assessing our business to remain competitive and ensure we are set up to deliver the best innovation, value, and service to our customers and partners,\" Dell told Business Insider.\n\nDell sales employees are paid through a mix of guaranteed base salary and a commission-based payment, known as their \"target incentive.\" The presentation used an example of an employee paid on a 60/40 mix, meaning 60% of their compensation was the salary, and the rest was the target incentive.\n\nUnder the previous salary structure, sellers who achieved between 0 and 100% of their sales target received the corresponding portion of their target incentive, according to the presentation. If they hit 80% of their goal, they got 80% of the payout; if they hit 50% of the goal, they got 50% of the payout.\n\nThe target incentive doubled for those who hit 100% to 200% of their targets.\n\nUnder the new changes, sellers who come in below 60% of their target get no commission.\n\nFor those who achieve between 60% and 100% of target, here's the new pay structure:\n\nFor top performers, the incentives just got better.\n\nSales workers who hit between 100% and 150% of their targets will now receive commissions worth three times the agreed target incentive portion of their salary, the presentation shows. That marks a 50% increase on what they'd previously received.\n\nDell is also moving sales teams to quarterly targets, according to the presentation.\n\nSmall and medium business teams already worked to quarterly targets, but now enterprise, large enterprise, DTS, AI Select, and Dell's telecom business will move from a twice-yearly compensation plan to quarterly quotas.\n\nAccording to the presentation, the decision to move to quarterly targets is linked to the company's upcoming modernization push. As Business Insider first reported, Dell is overhauling its internal systems on May 3 to help streamline internal operations for the AI future — an initiative it is calling One Dell Way.\n\nDell could adjust the quota cadence in the second half of the financial year, the presentation said: \"We will revisit the quota cadence and take the learnings from Q1 and Q2 to inform the decision about 2H.\"\n\nFive Dell sales employees who spoke to Business Insider about the pay structure changes said the adjustments were causing frustration and fear among some employees that their take-home pay could drop.\n\nA data center sales rep told Business Insider that for the last three years, they had consistently hit 70% to 80% of their quota, so they were looking at a 20% reduction in their take-home pay unless they could sell more.\n\nAll five employees said that hitting 100% of a target would become harder in the new quarterly timeframe. Their reasons included that quotas had risen over the last two years, industry supply chain shortages were slowing sales cycles, and, in certain divisions, such as federal accounts, lead times were long.\n\nEmployee dissatisfaction at Dell has been growing companywide in recent years amid layoffs and RTO mandates. The company's employee satisfaction score — known as the employee net promoter score, or eNPS, has declined by almost 50% in two years.\n\nIn 2024, Dell's sales teams received a 5-day RTO mandate months before the rest of the company, and last December, Business Insider reported that leaders were cracking down on attendance.\n\nSales staff are also dealing with tougher selling conditions amid an industry-wide shortage of memory chips. Along with most competitors, Dell raised prices on many of its products in December.\n\n\"Global memory and storage supply are tightening fast,\" Dell warned its go-to-market team members in an email viewed by Business Insider. The company told its sellers to \"move decisively\" ahead of the price increases to \"protect value for our customers and for Dell.\"\n\nOn the back of the AI boom, ISG sales have been strong — revenue was up 29% in Dell's last full financial year — but annual revenue has fallen for three consecutive years in the CSG division. In July 2025, Dell's COO and vice chair Jeff Clarke stepped in to handle day-to-day leadership of CSG. The company's stock is up 2.3% in the past year.\n\nIn a memo about One Dell Way last month, Clarke told Dell staffers to get ready for big changes.\n\n\"This is the biggest transformation in company history,\" Clarke said. \"I know there will be challenges, and that's OK—we're here to support you and work through this together.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "McKinsey CEO Bob Sternfels said last month that the firm added 25,000 AI agents to its staff in less than two years.\n\n\"I don't think the number of agents translates directly to value,\" EY's global engineering chief, Steve Newman, told Business Insider. \"In fact, some of the best value that we have is returned by just a handful of agents that are doing the heavy lifting.\"\n\nNewman said EY is more focused on measuring efficiency. He said EY tracks agent value through key performance indicators for productivity, quality, and cost.\n\n\"We chart those month to month, quarter to quarter, and that's what my lens is as to the effectiveness of AI,\" he said.\n\nPwC's chief AI officer, Dan Priest, also recently told Business Insider that he's unmoved by McKinsey's army of AI agents.\n\n\"I think that's probably the wrong measure,\" he said. The value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nSternfels first talked about his firm's onboarding of tens of thousands of agents in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He mentioned it again on an episode of Harvard Business Review's IdeaCast. A McKinsey spokesperson later confirmed to Business Insider that the number was accurate.\n\nSternfels said the firm plans to add more, too. In the next year and a half, every one of its 40,000 human employees will be \"enabled by at least one or more agents,\" he said.\n\nAI has rapidly reshaped the consulting industry in recent years. McKinsey, EY, PwC, and other consulting firms are all racing to both adopt AI internally and position themselves as the go-to for other companies seeking advice on how to do the same.\n\nEY said during an October earnings call that it invests more than $1 billion each year to develop AI-first platforms and products, including building 1,000 AI agents and deploying more than 100 internal AI applications.",

    "fullText": "The CEO of cybersecurity company Cato Networks believes we're experiencing an AI bubble — but he's still writing checks.\n\nSerial entrepreneur, Shlomo Kramer, told Business Insider that although the promise of AI is \"happening at a pace that is much slower\" than expected, he still believes in its ability to deliver results in the long-term.\n\nHe compared the current moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, which led to the demise of many companies.\n\n\"There was a lot of devastation,\" said Kramer, who runs the company aimed at securing organizations' digital and AI transformation. \"But e-commerce is obviously a major part of our life, and the same is going to be with AI.\"\n\nWhile Kramer believes some AI startups are overvalued, he said many are also reasonably priced — and he continues to invest in companies he thinks are promising.\n\nHe said that every startup needs a \"good combination of team, market, product.\" When evaluating the company's product, he said he looks for specific criteria that make it a worthwhile investment.\n\nKramer said he looks to check off three boxes when evaluating a product.\n\nFirst, he said it needs a \"hook.\" The concept should be \"quick to understand,\" he said, and something that he grasps intuitively without having to overthink or rationalize it.\n\nSecond, the product should have the potential to evolve into a platform, or at least a \"mini platform\" that can expand into something broader over time, the CEO said.\n\nThird, Kramer said the team should have a clear vision for the use cases that will ultimately turn the platform into a monetizable business.\n\nKramer has made roughly 67 investments, according to PitchBook, including in several successful enterprise software companies, such as Palo Alto Networks, Gong, and Trusteer, which was acquired by IBM. However, he's also made some mistakes, he said.\n\nWhile he said he's mainly invested in cybersecurity, he's \"intellectually curious\" about many areas, which has led him to invest in AI sectors outside of cyber, like pharmaceuticals and marketing. He said many of those investments into other realms have been mistakes, and he's recognized that it's \"much easier to get excited about things you don't understand.\"\n\n\"A deep understanding of something gives you granularity,\" Kramer said, adding that excitement usually comes from looking at the big-picture vision.\n\nKramer said his \"perfect startup\" is a homegrown application that evolved from a team's need for a product. He said that it's crucial for entrepreneurs to \"really understand the category\" the idea is rooted in and to understand it from a customer perspective.\n\nKramer said that's how the first startup he co-founded, Check Point Software Technologies, got its start. He said \"the secret sauce\" was that Gil Shwed, the previous CEO of Check Point, was a system administrator and understood the customer problem, which allowed him to create the right solution.\n\nCheck Point's market cap today is roughly $18.9 billion, according to PitchBook.",

Salesforce, Roper Technologies, and Intuit were some of the most-sold names in the same period.\n\nBeyond the past week, retail traders have broadly preferred buying media and semiconductor stocks while selling software since the start of 2026.\n\nRetail investors shared some of Wall Street's worries about Big Tech's AI spending after earnings, but sentiment was mixed, JPM said, citing Reddit comments.\n\nThe analysts highlighted that retail traders bought the post-earnings dip in Amazon and Alphabet shares, while sitting out on Meta stock's climb.\n\nJPMorgan flagged several stocks popular on social media that saw high retail buying and high hedge fund shorting.\n\nThey noted that this combination of social media interest and conflicting retail and institutional investors signals potential unexpected flows.\n\nIn the last week, stocks with a large imbalance between retail buying and hedge fund shorting include Hims and Hers and Strategy.",

    "fullText": "Marc Benioff's joke didn't just fail to land. It exploded on impact.\n\nThe Salesforce CEO's attempt at an ICE-related quip has employees up in arms, and comes as the company is already dealing with plenty of tension over its future, BI's Ashley Stewart writes.\n\nDuring Salesforce's employee-only \"Company Kickoff\" this week, Benioff asked those who traveled from outside the US to stand up before suggesting ICE agents were waiting for them in the back, employees who heard the comments said.\n\nThe internal reaction was swift and negative, with some fellow executives distancing themselves from the comments. Benioff has remained silent on the issue.\n\nIn a vacuum, the joke comes off as in poor taste. But consider that it happened as Salesforce's stock has dropped 45% in the past year. The company also sits at the center of an industry — software sales — that's been the focus of the latest AI-driven bloodbath.\n\nBenioff's comments also reflect a noticeable shift from the CEO.\n\nLike other tech executives, Benioff has shown support for President Donald Trump during his second term. (Benioff was also complimentary of Trump at times during his first go-round.)\n\nWhile catering to the current administration has become the norm among the tech elite, Benioff's change is especially striking considering his history of backing progressive causes.\n\nIn late 2019, Politico dubbed Benioff \"Tech's woke CEO\" as he pushed for more taxes in his industry and called for changes to capitalism. More recently, he asked Trump to send National Guard troops to San Francisco. (He later apologized.)\n\nPolitical shifts can be complicated for employees who might have joined expecting a specific type of culture. And trying to play both sides of the fence can often muddy the waters.\n\nOther companies are taking an unapologetic approach. Take Palantir's Alex Karp, who has vigorously defended his company's work with the military and dubbed it \"completely anti-woke.\"\n\nUltimately, tech workers might not have many options even if they feel their beliefs don't align with their company. A brutal job market and the threat of AI on engineering jobs mean many will have to stay put.",

    "description": "The company is making some smart strategic moves and keeping investors excited about its stock.",
    "fullText": "Americans are drinking less alcohol. Whether it's because of rising costs, shifting social dynamics, or the emergence of greener alternatives, beer and booze consumption is at the lowest on record.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped shares of alcohol behemoth Anheuser-Busch from ascending to their highest level since 2020. That stock gain has accelerated in 2026, and reached a fever pitch on Thursday after the company reported well-received earnings that eased worries over a demand collapse.\n\nSo what gives? Why is the world's biggest beer producer thriving as alcohol loses its foothold as an American cultural staple?\n\nIt can be broken down into five main reasons:\n\n1. A shift towards premium and non-beer products\n\nWhile this doesn't specifically address the decline of interest in alcohol, both pivots offer bigger margins for the company.\n\nMichelob Ultra — considered premium, which allows the company to charge higher prices — has become the most popular beer in the US. This may not be up the alley of company spokesmen Post Malone and Shane Gillis, who prefer Bud Light, but it's the way the nation is moving.\n\nMeanwhile, products like hard seltzers, hard teas, ready-to-drink cocktails, and ciders can fetch similar prices, and don't cost as much to manufacture. This played out in Anheuser-Busch's earnings report, which saw increased non-beer volumes helping to offset shrinking beer consumption.\n\nThis was another earnings bright spot on Thursday, when Anheuser-Busch reported growth in Africa and South America. It saw a record-high volume of beer sales in Colombia in 2025, and premium beer Corona helped drive double-digit growth in 30 markets.\n\n3. It's part of the defensive stock trade\n\nWhen the going gets tough, people crack a cold one … and buy consumer-staples stocks insulated from cyclical economic gyrations. Beer stocks are part of this group, and all of them — not just Anheuser-Busch — have risen over the last quarter.\n\nBut it's worth noting that Anheuser-Busch is the only one currently at multiyear highs. Constellation Brands, one of its major US competitors and the maker of wildly popular Modelo, is still basically flat over the past 12 months.\n\n4. Investors like the capital picture\n\nThe company announced a $6 billion buyback plan and a dividend last quarter. Its balance sheet is apparently in good enough shape to offer cash distribution to investors.\n\nOut of the 34 analysts that cover the stock, 27 of them have buy ratings, while the other seven have a hold.

    "title": "I'm an American who studied abroad at Zhejiang University in China. It was unlike anything I experienced back in the US.",
    "description": "When I studied abroad in college, I attended the school that just unseated Harvard as one of the best in the world: Zhejiang University in China",
    "fullText": "In the spring of 2013, I was a sophomore at Tufts University in Massachusetts, soon to declare a dual major in international relations and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nDespite my lofty aspirations to travel the world as a diplomat, my academic career so far had taken me a whopping 25 miles north of my hometown. That's why my university's study abroad program in China appealed to me.\n\nOnce I heard the tales of adventure from the 2012 program's freshly minted graduates, I eagerly applied. That summer, with an acceptance letter in hand, I set off to enroll at Zhejiang University.\n\nUpon landing in Shanghai, my American classmates and I were piled into a minibus for the two-hour drive south to the garden city of Hangzhou — capital of Zhejiang Province and home to Zhejiang University (affectionately referred to by locals as ZheDa).\n\nAfter settling into the dorm, which was a single room with a private bathroom, we were welcomed by our professors with a banquet at the college's canteen — an establishment which was far better than the standardized cafeteria fare that I'd come to know back in New England.\n\nIn our dormitory building, for the equivalent of $2 at the time, one could acquire a filling meal any time of the day — from rice porridge and steamed buns in the morning to stir-fried vegetables and sweet and sour pork tenderloin in the evening, all cooked fresh to order.\n\nZhejiang University was massive and spread across multiple campuses throughout the city. Fortunately for us newcomers, our group at the University's International College was tucked into a leafy hillside on the historic Yuquan campus, offering a slice of Chinese university life at an approachable scale.\n\nAs the sweltering days of summer transitioned into an osmanthus flower-scented autumn, I settled into a new school year. Each morning consisted of four hours of intensive language instruction, followed by at least a few more hours of homework and self-study in the afternoon.\n\nIn addition, each week we'd attend one three-hour lecture on Chinese Peasant History with our advisor, who drew heavily from his own experiences as an academic sent to the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution.\n\nI also had a three-hour lecture on the Chinese Legal System with a professor who'd argued many cases within China's rapidly evolving court system.\n\nWhile my application to enroll in Zhejiang University was relatively quick and painless, the road to admission for most of ZheDa's domestic student population was comparatively long and grueling.\n\nFrom an early age, they'd studied for hours at school, followed by hours at buxiban (cram schools), preparing to ace China's notoriously difficult standardized exams, such as the Gaokao. Of the millions who sit for the Gaokao each year, only the highest scorers earn spots in China's most prestigious schools, such as Peking, Tsinghua, and Zhejiang universities.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the academic work ethic that carried students to Zhejiang University did not fall off after admission. While most of my international classmates would study long hours during the week, we would take Friday nights and weekends off to travel within China. But many local students, however, rarely engaged in such frivolous pursuits and were more likely to be studying in the library on a Friday or Saturday evening.\n\nAs exams marked the end of my semester at ZheDa in December 2013, I personally experienced the exacting academic standards that my Chinese classmates were intimately familiar with. While I did pass all of my classes, a minor error in pronunciation or a stroke askew in a written character, mistakes that my Chinese professors back at Tufts may have overlooked, were marked down harshly by my professors at Zhejiang University.\n\nWhen scrolling Instagram in January 2025, I saw a familiar sight in a post from The New York Times — a statue of Mao Zedong standing before Laohe Hill and a familiar library, waving to the students on a verdant Yuquan Campus. Reading on, I was proud to learn that my study abroad alma mater had been named the most productive research university in the world by Leiden Rankings, outpacing even my hometown juggernaut, Harvard.\n\nI cannot say that I am shocked by this development. My semester at ZheDa showed me a culture of academic rigor on a scale few American universities can match, drawing from an academic talent pool far larger than in the US.\n\nMy time at ZheDa forced me out of my comfort zone and exposed me to an academic world significantly different from that in which I'd been educated, and I believe I am a more open-minded learner for it.",

    "title": "More hiring managers want you to prove you're good with AI during interviews",
    "description": "Some major companies are shifting from telling job candidates not to use AI to requiring them to use it to prove their tech fluency.",
    "fullText": "Leaders at the software company Canva used to wonder whether job candidates were secretly using AI during technical interviews.\n\nManagers saw the company's engineers getting more done with the technology, so they needed to ensure new hires could do the same.\n\n\"We just flipped the script and went, 'OK, we're going to invite you to use AI,'\" Brendan Humphreys, Canva's chief technology officer, told Business Insider.\n\nThe result, he said, has been stronger hires better equipped to wield powerful AI tools to help write code and solve problems.\n\nCanva is one of a growing number of companies — including Meta and McKinsey — that are inviting some job candidates to use AI in parts of the hiring process.\n\nBroadly, when ChatGPT emerged in late 2022, many employers worried that job seekers would use AI to help talk their way past interviewers. Yet as the technology becomes more capable and embedded in daily work, a number of companies are moving from policing it to evaluating candidates' AI know-how.\n\nThat's what happened at Arcade, an IT infrastructure startup. The company has always asked technical candidates to complete a take-home exercise. Yet now, it expects them to use AI in the process, Alex Salazar, the company's cofounder and CEO, told Business Insider.\n\nAs the technology's capabilities surged over the past year or so, he realized that candidates would likely turn to AI regardless of whether Arcade sanctioned it. Ultimately, Salazar said, the company wants its workers, including new hires, to use AI.\n\n\"So why are we creating this artificial test that doesn't even really reflect the work they're going to do when they get here?\" he said.\n\nHumphreys came to a similar conclusion at Canva. To factor in AI, he said, the company reworked its technical interview to make the questions \"complex, ambiguous, and problematic.\"\n\n\"If you just dump the question that we're giving you into an AI, you're going to get a substandard answer,\" Humphreys said.\n\nTo land a job at the company, which has about 265 million monthly users of its graphic design software, technical candidates need to know how to thoughtfully question AI, he said.\n\nOne way to avoid concerns that candidates might be leaning too hard on AI is to have job seekers show their work. In Canva's case, the company asks candidates to share their screen during a technical interview.\n\n\"We want to see the interactions with the AI as much as the output of the tool,\" Humphreys said.\n\nArcade tells candidates to use whatever AI tools they want on their exercise, then include a transcript of their conversations with the AI. The idea is to learn who knows how to do the job and to work with an agent. Doing so, Salazar said, comes with a \"very real learning curve.\"\n\nHe said that the shift to allowing AI use in the exercise meant that Arcade placed greater emphasis on a candidate's \"taste.\" That sensibility is important, he said, because AI can kick out answers, yet the best results often come from repeated iteration with these tools, he said.\n\n\"It's going to show their ability to use the AI, but it's also going to show what they think 'good' is,\" Salazar said of candidates' interactions with AI.\n\nOther companies want workers to demonstrate their AI acumen during the hiring process, too.\n\nIn a June post on an internal message board, Meta said it was developing a coding interview in which candidates could use an AI assistant, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nThat mode of working, Meta wrote, was \"more representative\" of the environment in which future developers would be operating. It also makes \"LLM-based cheating less effective,\" the company said, referring to large language models.\n\nThe consulting firm McKinsey & Company is piloting a change to its graduate recruiting process, asking candidates to use the company's internal AI assistant, Lilli, during case interviews to assess how they work with the technology, several media outlets reported in January.\n\nThe acceptance of, or even the preference for, AI in some parts of hiring doesn't mean companies will welcome job seekers who use the tools to misrepresent their skills. Even if a candidate gets away with it at first, hiring managers are likely to eventually discover that someone doesn't have the goods, Susan Peppercorn, an executive coach, told Business Insider.\n\nThat's because candidates who complete an assessment, for example, \"are going to have to explain how they arrived at their thinking,\" she said.\n\nUnderstanding that thought process is what Canva seeks in its hiring, said Humphreys, who oversees roughly 2,600 technical employees in roles including software engineering, IT, and machine learning.\n\nIt's a way of seeing whether a candidate makes sound technical decisions when it starts producing code, he said.\n\n\"What we're testing for now in our interview process is an ability to harness that power, to control that power — to kind of ride the dragon,\" Humphreys said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "fullText": "The blast radius keeps widening.\n\nThe Justice Department's release of over 3 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents has led to a fresh wave of backlash for people associated with the pedophile financier, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe documents have revealed friendly communications with Epstein, even after his 2008 conviction for sex offenses. Some of the people who've experienced fallout exchanged crude messages about women, shared government secrets, or had a more expansive relationship with him than previously known. One high-profile entertainment industry executive said he wanted to see Ghislaine Maxwell in \"bondage gear\" — well before any public accusation that she facilitated Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.\n\nIt's not the first time the vast trove of documents, broadly known as the Epstein files, has had consequences for his associates. Last fall, the release of tens of thousands of Epstein's emails by the House Oversight Committee led to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor being stripped of his title as a British royal and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers losing his teaching job at Harvard University and post on OpenAI's board.\n\nHere are nine people who've experienced consequences following the Justice Department's January 30 data dump. None of the people featured in this story has been accused of participating in Epstein's sex-trafficking scheme.\n\nGoldman Sachs' top lawyer turned in her resignation following weeks of scrutiny over her communications with the convicted sex offender. June 30 will be her last day as the Wall Street bank's chief legal officer and general counsel, the bank said on Thursday.\n\nThe DOJ's latest tranche of documents showed her offering Epstein advice on his legal troubles, including lawsuits brought by women accusing him of sexual abuse. She gushed over expensive gifts from him, including a $9,350 Hermes handbag, and referred to him in an email as \"Uncle Jeffrey.\"\n\nShe has previously said her relationship with the convicted sex offender was \"a professional association\" and has expressed \"regret\" over it. In the statement to Business Insider about her resignation, Ruemmler said it was her duty \"to put Goldman Sachs' interests first.\"\n\nThe high-powered corporate lawyer resigned as chairman Paul Weiss, calling reports about his relationship with Epstein a \"distraction\" for the white-show law firm. He also stepped down from the board of trustees of his alma mater, Union College.\n\nThe documents include emails showing he worked with Epstein to surveil a woman in a dispute with one of Karp's clients. Business Insider has confirmed that the client was billionaire private equity titan Leon Black, who counted Epstein among his advisors.\n\nKarp also visited Epstein's Manhattan mansion and asked him to help his son get a job with director Woody Allen.\n\nRepresentatives for Paul Weiss declined to comment beyond their press release announcing Scott Barshay as the law firm's new chair.\n\nThe US Commerce Secretary is facing bipartisan calls from lawmakers to resign after emails show he planned a visit to Epstein's island with his family in 2012. Lutnick previously said he served ties with Epstein, his former Manhattan neighbor, after first meeting him in 2005.\n\n\"My wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again,\" Lutnick told the New York Post last year.\n\nLutnick was called by Congress to answer for the discrepancy on Tuesday. He testified that he, his wife, and kids were at the island \"for an hour\" for lunch. The DOJ's files show the two men exchanged calls in 2011 and invested in the same company around the time of the island visit.\n\nThe White House has stood by Lutnick, with the Commerce Department saying: \"Mr. and Mrs. Lutnick met Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and had very limited interactions with him over the next 14 years.\"\n\nIn 2013, Tisch, owner of the New York Giants, exchanged numerous emails with Epstein about women, triggering a review by the National Football League.\n\nThe emails show Epstein updating Tisch on the women, including their ages, nationalities, and \"working girl\" status.\n\nAfter the emails were made public, he said he regretted associating with Epstein and that the women discussed in the emails were adults.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has said the league will review the communications and weigh whether they violate its personal conduct policies.\n\nA charity chaired by Ferguson — the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew — shuttered following the Justice Department's document dump. A spokesperson for the foundation, called Sarah's Trust, said the decision was made after \"months\" of discussion.\n\nThe records show Ferguson sent warm emails to Epstein in 2009, when he was imprisoned for soliciting sex from a minor. She referred to him as the \"brother I have always wished for\" and signed off another email with \"love you.\"\n\nFerguson previously said she regretted any association with Epstein. Representatives for Ferguson didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nMandelson quit his job as the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States, and left the British Labour Party itself, after the Epstein files showed him providing sensitive government information to the convicted sex offender.\n\nThe emails, dating back to Mandelson's time in senior posts under former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, show him informing Epstein about a change in tax rules, the sale of government assets during a UK financial crisis, and a European Union bailout of Greece's economy. The records also show Epstein sent money to Mandelson's husband, Reinaldo Avila da Silva.\n\nThe London's Metropolitan Police said it's investigating Mandelson over the emails appearing to leak financial information to Epstein.. Mandelson has denied any illegal activity and told The Times of London that his husband accepting the funds from Epstein reflected \"a lapse in our collective judgment.\"\n\nMcSweeney resigned as the chief of staff for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer over Mandelson, whom he recommended for the ambassadorship job.\n\n\"I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice,\" McSweeney said in a statement upon his resignation on Sunday. \"In public life responsibility must be owned when it matters most, not just when it is most convenient. In the circumstances, the only honourable course is to step aside.\"\n\nSoccer player Abby Wambach and singer Chapell Roan said they were parting ways with Wasserman's agency.\n\nWasserman flew on Epstein's jet with a group of people that included former President Bill Clinton. The files also show Wasserman and Ghislaine Maxwell exchanging racy and flirtatious emails in 2003, well before police began investigating Epstein, and over a decade before Maxwell's arrest on sex-trafficking charges in 2020.\n\n\"Casey - I will be coming back to NY torn late afternoon,\" Maxwell wrote in one email. \"I shall be wearing a tight leather flying suit.\"\n\nWasserman said in a statement that he regretted his messages with Maxwell, which took place \"long before her horrific crimes came to light\" and that he never had any personal or business relationship with Epstein.\n\nRepresentatives at Wasserman's eponymous agency didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe CBS News contributor and longevity expert stepped down as the chief science officer of David Protein, a protein bar brand, and is no longer an adviser to the sleep technology company Eight Sleep.\n\nIn the emails from the mid-2010s, Attia gives Epstein health advice that included crude remarks about women. In one email, he said a woman's genitalia was \"low carb.\"\n\nIn a social media post, he denied involvement in any criminal activity and said the emails were \"embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible.\"",

    "fullText": "The Utah Jazz have been fined $500,000 (£367,000) by the NBA for benching healthy players and \"compromising the integrity\" of the league.\n\nHead coach Will Hardy removed stars Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr before the fourth quarter of their games against the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat this month.\n\nThe tactic, known as 'tanking', is used by coaches to improve draft position by fielding a non-competitive team and forfeiting victory.\n\nThe draft system means teams finishing lowest in the standings have the best chances of landing the top prospects.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers were also fined $100,000 (£73,000) for violating the player participation policy during their defeat against the Jazz on 4 February.\n\n\"Overt behaviour like this that prioritises draft position over winning undermines the foundation of NBA competition and we will respond accordingly to any further actions that compromise the integrity of our games,\" said NBA commissioner Adam Silver.\n\n\"Additionally, we are working with our competition committee and board of governors to implement further measures to root out this type of conduct.\"\n\nA play-off push looks unlikely for both the Jazz, who are 13th in the Western Conference, and the Pacers, who sit 14th in the Eastern, and thoughts appear already to be turning to next season and how their roster will be assembled.\n\nUtah led by nine points in the fourth quarter of their meeting with Orlando on 8 February but went on to lose 120-117, while they beat Miami 115-111 two days later.\n\n\"Agree to disagree. Also, we won the game in Miami and got fined? That makes sense,\" Utah owner Ryan Smith posted on social media.\n\nHead coach Hardy defended his decision to bench Markkanen and Utah have also announced Jackson Jr will have season-ending surgery on his knee after this weekend's All-Star games.\n\n\"I sat Lauri because he was on a minutes restriction,\" Hardy said. \"So if our medical team puts a minutes restriction on Lauri, I'll try to keep Lauri healthy.\"\n\nUtah were also fined $100,000 (£73,000) last season for resting Markkanen in multiple games.\n\nThe Pacers' fine was issued for violating the player participation policy after a league investigation found Pascal Siakam and two other players who sat out the game \"could have played\" even if it was with \"reduced minutes\".\n\nThe policy was introduced in 2023 in an attempt to discourage teams from purposely losing to improve their chances in the draft lottery.",

    "fullText": "While the cat is away the mice will play so, while some EFL clubs look to the magic of the FA Cup this weekend, their rivals will hope to steal a march by putting points on the board.\n\nMiddlesbrough and Coventry fans can spend the weekend pacing up and down waiting for their Championship showdown under the Monday night lights, but for now let us concentrate on what Saturday brings us.\n\nEd Still takes charge of Watford for the first time with the top six in view and there is a world where Millwall can push themselves into the automatic promotion conversation.\n\nLeagues One and Two present us with two first v third match-ups along with play-off pushes and relegation scraps.\n\nHere are five things which have caught our eye.\n\nWatford appointing a new head coach is not really big news. Watford having a third head coach in the same season is not really big news either. But Watford appointing Ed Still is definitely news.\n\nHaving watched his brother Will succeed on the continent but then fail with Southampton in the Championship this season, it has not deterred his older sibling from stepping into the chaotic world of Vicarage Road.\n\nThe 35-year-old's first engagement is at fellow play-off hopefuls Preston (15:00 GMT) and it is the competitive nature of the Championship which means, despite being six games without a win, victory at Deepdale could push the Hornets into the play-off places.\n\n\"It's tough, it isn't the same as European football - it's super, super, super-competitive, I think it's the most competitive league across Europe,\" Still told the BBC's 72+ EFL podcast.\n\n\"I am 100% a head coach, I am definitely not a manager - I am just a cog in Watford FC.\"\n\nThe trouble for Still is Watford like to change their cogs quite a lot and getting off to a winning start will be no easy matter at a Preston side who know a win themselves will guarantee them finishing Saturday in the top six.\n\nNow, there may well be a fair few Millwall fans who fancied they could be in the Championship play-off shake-up, but how many thought automatic promotion might be in the offing?\n\nThere is a long way to go but a win at doomed Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday (15:00 GMT) would leave them only three points behind second-placed Coventry, who have that engagement at home to the leaders Middlesbrough on Monday.\n\nMillwall have conceded only one goal in their past three outings, with last Saturday's win at promotion rivals Wrexham setting down some sort of marker.\n\nThey still have to go to Hull City, Ipswich and Middlesbrough, but first there is a trip to Hillsborough which has boss Alex Neil a little wary.\n\n\"We need to go there and attack this game and try to win it. I don't want us thinking we will walk up and score three by half-time - that's not how football works,\" he told BBC Radio London.\n\nCardiff City and Lincoln City have been setting such a furious pace at the top of League One that at times it has looked a matter of when, not if, they secure promotion.\n\nBolton Wanderers are doing their best to prevent that happening with a run of four successive wins bursting them from the pack and into contention as they prepare for a trip to second-placed Lincoln on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\n\n\"It's one of the hardest places to go in the division - but they'll know they've got a good team coming to them. I still think there'll be twists and turns,\" Bolton head coach Steven Schumacher said.\n\nBoth sides have taken 16 points from their past six matches to top the division's form guide, but the Imps hold a six-point advantage over the Trotters.\n\nDespite what Schumacher says, even at this stage, it feels like a pivotal meeting for the visitors if Lincoln are not to disappear over the hill and into the Championship.\n\nHe spent part of his eight months between management jobs working at Bristol Airport doing \"something meaningful with my time\" as a customer care assistant.\n\nPeterborough supporters will agree he has not let the grass grow under his feet since arriving at London Road in October and is \"doing something meaningful\" with a previously struggling side.\n\nWilliams has taken Posh from the bottom of League One up to eighth, within five points of the play-off places, winning five of their past nine league games (although losing four).\n\nThe side occupying the final play-off spot are Bradford City and that is where Williams takes his side on Saturday (15:00 GMT)\n\nThe Bantams are faltering with four defeats from six leaving the chasing pack snapping at their heels.\n\nThere is a lot to be said for promotion from the National League.\n\nLeague Two leaders Bromley host another recent addition to the EFL in third-placed Notts County on Saturday (15:00 GMT), but further down the division is not such a happy story.\n\nBarrow's return to the league in 2020 had a bit of romanticism and justice about it for those of a certain age.\n\nIn the days before automatic promotion, the bottom four teams of what was then Division Four had to apply for re-election and in 1972, despite finishing above two other clubs, the Bluebirds were kicked out to be replaced by Hereford.\n\nForty-eight years later Barrow were back. Leading the National League table when Covid shut down the season, they were on the right end of a vote this time to curtail the campaign and were declared champions.\n\nThere have been a couple of close squeaks as twice they just avoided a return to the non-league ranks, but also a near miss with the play-offs when they fell out of the top seven on the final day of the 2023-24 season.\n\nThis year is looking bleak with boss Paul Gallagher sacked on Wednesday after losing all five games of his six-week tenure and being replaced by Dino Maamria - their sixth permanent boss in fewer than four years.\n\nIt leaves Barrow three points clear of trouble with play-off hopefuls Colchester United dropping by on Saturday (15:00 GMT).\n\nAfter that comes a meeting with bottom side Harrogate and the final day has a home game against a Newport side that are second from bottom - Barrow will not want their struggles getting that far.\n\nIt has been 22 years since Cumbria was last without an EFL club, Maamria will need to get busy quickly if that is not to become a possibility again.\n\nBBC Sport will have live text coverage of Saturday's EFL action.",

    "fullText": "Move is a ‘backwards step’, company spokesperson says, amid concerns Kremlin is seeking more state control via messaging apps such as Max\n\nRussia has attempted to “fully block” WhatsApp in an attempt to push users towards its own state-sponsored communications app, Max, a spokesperson for the Meta-owned company has said.\n\nThe company did not reveal more detail on what extent the attempt succeeded or what action was taken to try to block the app.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, the WhatsApp spokesperson said: “Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia. We continue to do everything we can to keep users connected.”\n\nThe move fits into the Kremlin’s aim to achieve a “sovereign internet” – an online space cut off from western technology and foreign influence, and more vulnerable to state control.\n\nThe latest rift between Russia and WhatsApp comes amid a broader crackdown on social media, most recently targeting Telegram, another popular messaging app used by more than 60 million Russians each day. The move triggered criticism from frontline Russian troops, as well as pro-war bloggers and exiled opposition figures.\n\nAfter users reported slower traffic and delays in downloading videos and images on Tuesday, Telegram’s Russian-born billionaire founder, Pavel Durov – who is based in Dubai – criticised Russian authorities. “Restricting citizens’ freedom is never the right answer,” he said, adding: “Telegram stands for freedom of speech and privacy, no matter the pressure.”\n\nThe Russian state-sponsored app, Max, is largely modelled on China’s own “super app” WeChat and has approximately 55 million users across Russia. In August last year, Russia ordered Max be pre-installed on new phones, with critics arguing that the app could be used to surveil users, a claim dismissed in state media as false.\n\nOwned by Meta, WhatsApp reportedly has at least 100 million users in Russia, making it the country’s most widely used messaging service, according to the Financial Times, which previously reported that Russian authorities removed the app from an online directory operated by Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media monitoring agency.\n\nThe outlet added that Russian authorities also removed Facebook and Instagram – both also owned by Meta – from the directory.\n\nIn December last year, Russian authorities blocked access to Snapchat and also placed restrictions on FaceTime, Apple’s own video calling service.\n\nWhen asked if WhatsApp would return in Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency Tass in a video published on Wednesday: “This is again a question of fulfilling the legislation. If the Meta corporation fulfils this and enters into dialogue with Russian authorities, then we have the possibility of reaching an agreement.”\n\nPeskov added: “If the corporation [Meta] sticks to an uncompromising position and, I would say, shows itself unready to align with Russian legislation, then there is no chance.”\n\nThe Guardian has contacted the Kremlin for additional comment.",

    "fullText": "Maker of chatbot with coding ability says annualised revenue grew tenfold in each of past three years, to $14bn\n\nAnthropic, the US AI startup behind the Claude chatbot, has raised $30bn (£22bn) in a funding round that more than doubled its valuation to $380bn.\n\nThe company’s previous funding round in September achieved a value of $183bn, with further improvements in the technology since then spurring even greater investor interest.\n\nThe fundraising was announced amid a series of stock market moves against industries that face disruption from the latest models, including software, trucking and logistics, wealth management and commercial property services.\n\nThe funding round, led by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and the hedge fund Coatue Management, is among the largest private fundraising deals on record.\n\n“Anthropic is the clear category leader in enterprise AI,” said Choo Yong Cheen, the chief investment officer of private equity at GIC.\n\nAnthropic said its annualised revenue – an estimate of full-year sales based on recent company data – had reached $14bn, having grown more than tenfold in each of the past three years. A significant driver of recent growth has been Claude Code, the company’s AI-powered coding tool that became generally available in May 2025.\n\nAnthropic’s rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft and SoftBank, has been assembling what is reportedly a far larger round of up to $100bn that would value the ChatGPT developer at about $830bn.\n\nThe staggering sums being raised reflect equally staggering burn rates, with the companies spending cash to cover their huge costs of computing and attracting researcher talent.\n\nAnthropic has forecast reducing its cash burn to roughly a third of revenue in 2026 and just 9% by 2027, with a break-even target of 2028 – two years ahead of its rival, according to reports. Both companies are widely expected to pursue initial public offerings in the second half of 2026.\n\nThe rapid valuation increases for leading AI startups such as Anthropic and OpenAI, whose price tags far exceed those of many of the US’s largest listed companies, has alarmed some observers. Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”.\n\nSome listed firms at the forefront of the AI industry have also come under stock market pressure in recent days.\n\nShares in Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have fallen by 4.2% so far this week, indicating some investors are still spooked by the big AI-related spending plans it laid out this month. Meta has declined by 1.7% during this week. Shares in Nvidia, a leading chipmaker and key provider of AI infrastructure, dropped by 1.6% on Thursday amid a wider sell-off but have been flat on the week.\n\n“A gloomy session on Wall Street on Thursday put investors in a grumpy mood at the end of the trading week,” said Russ Mould, the investment director at investment platform AJ Bell.\n\n“Association with AI has gone from party to peril as investors reappraise what the technology means for companies. \n\n “Some are concerned about excessive levels of spending and others fear AI will disrupt multiple industries. It all adds up to a cocktail of worries and that’s bad for market sentiment more broadly,” Mould added.\n\nFounded in 2021 by the siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, both former executives at OpenAI, Anthropic has positioned itself as a safety-focused alternative in the AI race.\n\nThe funding round also comes shortly after Anthropic’s first television commercials were broadcast during Super Bowl LX, using the campaign to emphasise that its products remain ad-free. The ads took an apparent jab at OpenAI, which has begun to introduce advertising into the free version of ChatGPT.\n\nAnthropic’s earlier backers include Amazon, which has invested $8bn and serves as a primary computing partner through its datacentres, as well as Google, which invested $2bn in 2023.\n\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this article",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: in 2025 briefing to Wes Streeting, officials warned reputation of tech firm behind US ICE operations would hinder rollout of data system in UK\n\nHealth officials fear Palantir’s reputation will hinder the delivery of a “vital” £330m NHS contract, according to briefings seen by the Guardian, sparking fresh calls for the deal to be scrapped.\n\nIn 2023, ministers selected Palantir, a US surveillance technology company that also works for the Israeli military and Donald Trump’s ICE operation, to build an AI-enabled data platform to connect disparate health information across the NHS.\n\nNow it has emerged that after Keir Starmer demanded faster deployment, Whitehall officials privately warned that the public perception of Palantir would limit its rollout, meaning the contract would not offer value for money.\n\nPalantir was this week called “ghastly” and “a highly questionable organisation” by MPs in the House of Commons.\n\nThe fallout over Peter Mandelson’s relationship to the convicted child sexual abuse offender Jeffrey Epstein has also affected the image of Palantir, which employed the former US ambassador’s lobbying company, Global Counsel.\n\nBefore he was sacked, Mandelson took Starmer to meet Palantir’s chief executive, Alex Karp, at the tech company’s Washington showroom.\n\nMPs last week demanded greater transparency around Palantir’s public sector deals, which also include a £240m contract with the Ministry of Defence and with several police forces.\n\nIn a private briefing for Wes Streeting before a meeting with Palantir’s European boss, Louis Mosley, in June 2025, Department of Health officials wrote: “The public perception of the [Federated Data Platform (FDP)] during the procurement, and then in delivery, has been affected by the profile of Palantir.\n\n“We do not know the extent to which this is impacting on delivery. It is, however, likely to make it harder to go further with the FDP, and to encourage the inclusion of GP data locally.”\n\nThe briefing was released under the Freedom of Information Act to Foxglove, a tech fairness campaign group.\n\nThe officials said the rollout had also been affected by debates about patient privacy and concerns that the NHS was being “locked-in” to a single vendor, but added: “Many of these debates are inaccurate and are often as a result of misconceptions.”\n\nDonald Campbell, director of advocacy at Foxglove, said: “The prime minister and the health secretary should listen to the public they serve when they tell them Palantir has no place in the NHS.\n\n“They should not be scheming with tech billionaires’ staff on how best they can ‘mitigate’ the ‘public perception’ problems these tech giants deservedly face through their own repellent behaviour.”\n\nThe BMA, which represents NHS doctors, said it has “long opposed the involvement of Palantir in the delivery of care and the use of patient data in our NHS, and it is concerning to see from this briefing that the government felt public concern about Palantir should be dismissed as ‘misconceptions’”.\n\nThe briefing document suggested Streeting could ask Palantir how to speed up the rollout, and say that the government was keen to “remove unnecessary obstacles” including by revisiting “regulations relating to confidential patient information”.\n\nStreeting on Monday sought to show he had “nothing to hide” regarding his relationship with Mandelson by publishing their WhatsApp messages between August 2024 and October 2025.\n\nNone mentioned Palantir, although in one exchange just over three weeks after Streeting’s meeting with the company, Mandelson encouraged him to visit the US and said: “Need to plan. Lots of tech companies and people to talk to.”\n\nNew figures released on Thursday showed that the number of NHS organisations using the Palantir technology has increased since June from 118 to 151, which is still well short of the target of 240 by the end of this year.\n\nPalantir was co-founded by the Trump supporter and billionaire Peter Thiel, who has previously said “the NHS makes people sick”, and described the British public’s affection for the NHS as a case of “Stockholm syndrome” – the term for hostages who feel a bond with their captors.\n\nThe former Conservative government minister David Davis said the government now faced a “huge value-for-money issue” over the Palantir contract.\n\nHe said there had been “naivety in the senior management of the NHS” in awarding a contract to a company with “spectacular baggage in terms of its genesis in the American security state”.\n\n“The government is going to have a problem with many hospital trusts and they are going to have really difficult problems with the GPs,” he said. “My best estimate is they will never get most of the GPs with an organisation like Palantir.”\n\nJohn Puntis, co-chair of the Keep Our NHS Public campaign, said: “This looks like another example of a hugely wasteful IT contract, and lack of public trust will make it unworkable.\n\n“They ought to end the contract or not renew it. They should accept that the public is very concerned and it is going to make the use of public data very difficult if people think it’s going to be accessed by a company like Palantir.”\n\nA spokesperson for Palantir said: “Palantir software is helping to deliver better public services in the UK. That includes delivering 99,000 more NHS operations and reducing hospital discharge delays by 15%, as well as helping the Royal Navy keep ships at sea for longer and the police to tackle domestic violence.”\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Federated Data Platform is already delivering for the NHS – helping to join-up patient care, increase hospital productivity, speed up cancer diagnosis and ensure thousands of additional patients can be treated each month.\n\n“All providers go through a rigorous, competitive procurement process in line with Government legislation. All data operates under the instruction of the NHS, with strict stipulations in the contract about confidentiality.”\n\nNHS England declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "Former assistant manager Tony Docherty has rejoined Aberdeen to strengthen Peter Leven's interim management team despite sporting director Lutz Pfannenstiel promising an announcement about a permanent appointment \"imminently\".\n\nDocherty's surprise return comes a week after it was revealed that former Rosenborg, Brann and Saint-Etienne head coach Eirik Horneland had emerged as a leading candidate to succeed the sacked Jimmy Thelin during negotiations.\n\nAmid a further delay to making a full-time appointment, Aberdeen have yet to respond to speculation that the 50-year-old Norwegian is not in a position to take up the appointment until the summer.\n\nPfannenstiel has been leading the search for a replacement since Thelin was sacked on 4 January and did reveal that Docherty was coming in to assist Leven \"during this interim period\".\n\nDundee Utd face four matches in 14 days on weather-struck pitch\n\nHorneland 'intensity' perfect for Aberdeen - Stavrum\n\nThe 55-year-old first joined the Scottish Premiership club in 2013 as part of Derek McInnes' management team and went on to spend eight years at Pittodrie.\n\nHe was also McInnes' number two with Kilmarnock before spells as manager with Dundee and Ross County but sacked by the latter in December with his side bottom of the Championship.\n\n\"Tony has a wealth of experience and knows the Club inside out,\" Pfannenstiel told his club website.\n\n\"He has excellent knowledge of the Scottish Premiership, both as a coach and a manager, and that will be invaluable for us in the short term.\n\n\"Our managerial search is now reaching its conclusion and we hope to be in a position to announce our new head coach imminently.\"\n\nLeven, who is in his third spell as caretaker, welcomed Docherty's appointment.\n\n\"It's great to have someone of Tony's experience back in the Aberdeen dugout for the upcoming games,\" Leven added.\n\n\"He was very enthusiastic about coming in when I spoke with him and his presence and knowledge at both training and matches will be a big boost to me and the squad.\"\n\nHorneland left Saint-Etienne at the start of February with his side sitting fourth in France's second tier.\n\nShould Aberdeen decide to wait until the summer for the Norwegian to take charge, it will mirror the six-month delay in Thelin arriving at Pittodrie from Elfsborg in summer 2024.\n\nVisit our Aberdeen page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Aberdeen news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "fullText": "\"Yet another bizarre appointment by the chairman.\"\n\n\"I don't get it... why not go for someone with a proven track record in the Championship?\"\n\n\"I cannot believe we are doing this again... a complete nobody with no experience in English football.\"\n\nHull City's decision to appoint Sergej Jakirovic as their new head coach in June last year was not met with much, or indeed any, enthusiasm from a number of fans.\n\nThe Tigers had just avoided relegation to League One on goal difference, one season after now Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior was sacked for only managing a seventh-placed finish.\n\nYet many were still surprised Ruben Selles was fired after keeping them up.\n\nHowever, Jakirovic and Hull have confounded expectations to sit just five points off the top two in the Championship.\n\nAs the former Bosnia international prepares to welcome Chelsea for a FA Cup fourth-round tie, how did the much-travelled 49-year-old end up leading an unexpected promotion charge in East Yorkshire?\n\n\"With a towering stature and steely gaze that could burn a hole through concrete, Sergej Jakirovic walked into the media suite at Hull City's MKM Stadium last summer and immediately commanded the attention of everyone in attendance,\" BBC Radio Humberside's Hull City reporter Mike White said.\n\n\"Based on that first impression, you'd be forgiven for thinking he was going to be a tough nut to crack for those of us in the media who'd be dealing with him all the time.\n\n\"However, it didn't take long for us to realise that first impressions aren't always the best way to judge someone.\n\n\"He's personable with an engaging sense of humour, intelligent, passionate and always forthright in his views.\"\n\nIt took a while for Jakirovic to made those first impressions count on the pitch as City made a mixed start to the season, with two wins, three draws and three losses in their opening eight league matches.\n\nA good run through October and November propelled them up the table but it was a 4-1 home reverse by Middlesbrough that built the platform for their move into promotion contention.\n\nAfter that defeat by Boro, Hull had conceded 34 goals from 19 games, the second-worst defensive record in the league.\n\nSince then they have let in just nine goals from their subsequent 12 games, with eight wins and six clean sheets in that run.\n\nThe Tigers are averaging 45% possession compared to 49% last season and making an average of 276 successful passes per game, 70 fewer than last time out.\n\nUnder Tim Walter and Selles last season the side scored two goals from what football statisticians Opta define as fast breaks - this season it's already nine.\n\nExperienced striker Oli McBurnie, who has scored 12 goals in 22 league appearances this season, said that the team are benefitting from the trust the manager and staff have in the players.\n\n\"It's not been like a dictatorship. Since they've come in they've understood what English football and culture is about,\" he told BBC Radio Humberside.\n\n\"They will have a conversation with you. Obviously, the gaffer has the final decision but they've been brilliant.\n\n\"They understand the league and understand that we know the league and our opinions matter and having Dean [Holden] on the staff is massive for them.\"\n\nFriday, 13 February - 19:45 GMT\n\nWatch on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport website and app; listen on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio Humberside\n\nWhite agrees that Jakirovic's work has been built on solid foundations with sporting director Jared Dublin and head of recruitment Martin Hodge.\n\nHowever, against a backdrop of a lengthy injury list that at one point saw Jakirovic say he had 11 fit senior players, he believes the manager deserves \"a tremendous amount of credit\".\n\n\"It should be said that going into this season little was expected of a team working under a two-window EFL transfer restriction - only free signings and loans without fees were permitted - but the quality of recruitment has been nothing short of remarkable,\" said White.\n\n\"Adding to their challenges have been one serious injury after another to some of their key players like Oli McBurnie, John Lundstram, Joe Gelhardt and Mo Belloumi - a list that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of the full injury crisis the club has found itself in consistently.\n\n\"Yet still they plough on, with a shot at the top two still a very real possibility - particularly given Coventry's recent downturn in form - so a return to the Premier League after nine years away shouldn't be ruled out.\n\n\"And Jakirovic deserves a tremendous amount of credit for steering it all in the right direction.\"\n\nJakirovic was born in to a football family in Mostar, then part of Yugoslavia, in December 1976.\n\nHis father Enver played as a goalkeeper for NK Neretva in modern-day Croatia and it was there that the Tigers boss began his own playing career.\n\nAcross 20 years he played as a defensive midfielder in Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Austria and also won five caps for Bosnia.\n\nA third generation of the family is now looking to make their way in the game - he gave a professional debut to his son Leon at Dinamo Zagreb when the latter was just 16 in May 2024.\n\nThe teenager moved on to Italian super club Inter Milan last month.\n\nAfter hanging up his boots, Jakirovic started his senior coaching career at Croatian second division side Sesvete in 2017 and then moved on to top tier side Gorica the following year.\n\nA brief spell with Slovenian champions Maribor followed before he guided Bosnian outfit Zrinjski Mostar to the title in 2021-22.\n\nHe returned to Croatia to take over at Rijeka in November 2022 but quit to replace former Liverpool midfielder Igor Biscan at Dinamo Zagreb in August 2023 and won the Croatian double that season.\n\nHowever, after becoming the first team to concede nine goals in a Champions League game, when they were demolished 9-2 by Bayern Munich, Jakirovic left in September 2024.\n\nTurkish strugglers Kayserispor appointed him as their boss in January last year and he led them away from relegation danger before making the move to England.\n\n\"When you look at Sergej's career he was successful everywhere he went,\" owner Acun Ilicali told BBC Radio Humberside in the summer after making Jakirovic his fifth boss since taking over in January 2022.\n\n\"He played the football at Kayserispor that I want to see my team play.\n\n\"When you look at his career he has the talent to make all his teams play similar games.\"\n\nDespite the early scepticism, it looks like this \"bizarre appointment\" could just be the perfect one.\n\nLatest Hull City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Hull City content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains the key things a manager can do before, during and after matches to get the results they want.",
    "fullText": "I've talked a lot in this column about all the different work a manager does in trying to build everything you need in place at a club to be successful, but this week I want to talk about what happens around a game itself - before, during and afterwards.\n\nFor me, preparation for any game always started two hours after the one I had just managed.\n\nMy drive home to the south coast on a Saturday night after a game could take three hours or more, and much of that would be spent on the phone while I had precious quiet time.\n\nWhen I was at Stoke City, my chairman Peter Coates would always speak to me then if we lost. If we'd won, he never bothered, knowing I wouldn't need comforting.\n\nWin or lose, however, I would always ring my assistants, David Kemp and Gerry Francis, and we would discuss the game in finer detail - away from the stadium to give us a different perspective.\n\nThen I would contact my chief scout, who would have been at our next opponent's game, for a quick run-down of what he had seen - their shape, patterns, strength, weaknesses and any injuries.\n\nSunday was about spending all day with the family, but then either late on Sunday night or early on Monday morning I would be back up the motorway, with a clear view of what I believed was needed for our next game.\n\nThe players' week is always scheduled around the next game too. Monday was a light training session with the players who played on Saturday, and a debrief in a match-related game versus the reserves.\n\nThroughout my managerial career, I always wanted to show people I worked with what I wanted, and we would go through positives and negatives from Saturday live on the pitch.\n\nIf they needed it clarified then, whatever it was, it was sorted out in a game-related session on the grass. The players who hadn't started on Saturday stayed out afterwards, and had a much tougher morning.\n\nThis kind of work was always vital to me for us to get things right the following Saturday. Whether it was at Stoke, Crystal Palace or West Brom, I always recognised each team's strengths, and we all needed to be aware of the team's identity.\n\nYes, at each of those clubs we took different routes to get to our objective, but the aims - and challenges - were the same.\n\nHaving that clear identity and also a system that suits your players is paramount to success, but as a manager you also have to be confident and brave in leading and directing your strong personal views.\n\nPlayers will always test you, but will respect clarity and leadership if it stands firm under pressure. The reason I am mentioning this now, in respect to game days, is because it matters the most then.\n\nThe best example I can give is in the week before games against the very top teams I went overboard trying to exude confidence in my team and my tactics.\n\nIt didn't always work, but I believed that if they felt that from me, it would help them come the big day.\n\nAfter a full week of working on every player - drilling into each individual the understanding of their role in the team and how it would affect everything if he did not carry it off - I would then set about the ways we could hurt the opposition.\n\nObviously set-plays have now become a byword for how teams can do that successfully, but that was the case before me and it is the same now I have retired.\n\nAs well as attacking set-plays, defending them was something else we would work on. Whether it was in attack or defence, every individual knew his own personal challenge.\n\nOn the Saturday, I would turn up for a home game at about 11am, and in my early years I would also train myself before games.\n\nAt this stage, with only a few hours to go until kick-off, I would run through everything again and wait until the lads started to arrive. Once they were all settled, I would have a quick chat - nothing too rousing! - and then leave the dressing room.\n\nOnce the opposition teamsheet arrived, about 75 minutes before kick-off, I would check our markers against their players - this was important because I always man-marked!\n\nI would take that board into our dressing room, and out I would go again, until they arrived back from their warm-ups. Everything said from then on until the players left to start the game was confidence filling, with no negatives at all.\n\nThe actual team talk itself and the last things you said to the players could be very different depending on the occasion. It was not always me who gave it, either.\n\nAgain at Stoke, I got Ricardo Fuller up to speak right before our FA Cup semi-final against Bolton at Wembley in 2011.\n\nRic was such a great character and also a player with exceptional ability. Unfortunately he was injured and out of the game but he delivered a once-in-a-lifetime speech to the team, quoting Nelson Mandela.\n\nWe won the game 5-0 and to this day I am sure Ric believes his speech drove the lads to that famous result. The players would all tell you it certainly got them going.\n\nIt just shows you that the way to succeed in football management is not set in stone. You need tremendous resilience, yes, but also many more human strings to your bow.\n\nIn my early years at Stoke, we were always the underdogs, and the atmosphere was off the charts, never mind who we played.\n\nAs time went by and we became established, teams coming to Stoke were much more prepared for the experience, and our supporters became less reliant on our underdog status and rightly so.\n\nTo make up for this I began to use more psychological methods to generate the atmosphere in the dressing room that would help motivate the players.\n\nThat might mean mentioning recent comments or coverage that was negative towards us, or even bringing up stuff I had remembered from our early days at the club - anything that criticised us in any shape of form, that I knew would generate a positive response from the lads.\n\nThis method helped us greatly going into games we were expected to win.\n\nWhat you say at half-time is important too.\n\nI would always get two or three main points over about how the match was going, but you have to be careful what you say and do because the break can dramatically change the whole flow of the game.\n\nI've watched my team be really on it in the first half, then completely lose control of the game inside the first five minutes of the second half - and vice versa.\n\nIt's something all managers and coaches must be wary of, and I certainly was.\n\nI often tell the story of how Stoke were once 2-0 up at Blackburn at half-time and, as they were walking off the pitch, I just got a feeling a bit of complacency was setting in with our lads, who were patting each other on the back.\n\nSo, I decided to liven the dressing room up and picked on my captain Ryan Shawcross, who - by the way - had been absolutely outstanding that half. I gave him both barrels, and that left everyone extremely shocked.\n\nThe second half came and went with us seeing the game out and getting a deserved victory, but Ryan came to see me on the Monday - he was still pretty upset and did not know what had happened.\n\nI explained my reasons - I knew Blackburn boss Sam Allardyce would be after a big response from his lads in the second half, so to compensate for that I had to put everyone on edge.\n\nIt worked but, trust me, that was not always the case.\n\nAs a manager, you can obviously change things when the game is going on too.\n\nWhen I started in management, there was only one substitute permitted, but today you can change five players.\n\nThat's half of the outfield team that have started the game so, with squads so large now too, then it certainly can be a massive help to the coach.\n\nI look at the top teams' benches now and sometimes I can't believe the quality on there, which is something else that has changed in the past 30 years.\n\nMaking changes is always a pre-meditated option. Yes, I have taken players off for playing poorly, because we needed to hold on to a lead or were desperately trying to claw a goal back, but most of the time you have still got a plan.\n\nAs I've mentioned before when I talked about scouting players, the game has moved on to such an extent in the past 30 years that computers play a big part now in providing you with information.\n\nIt is the same during today's games too, to the extent computers on the side of the pitch can release certain data that can have an effect on a manager's thinking, either around individuals for substitutions or overall team analysis.\n\nI always trusted my own eyes, though. Although I have seen some fantastic advancements made with team analysis and individuals' live game data, I always backed my experience and judgement.\n\nOf course those decisions can have a huge impact if you get them right. I listen now to some commentators drooling over substitutions that change games, and what a genius the manager was to make those changes.\n\nWell, I have had those plaudits myself but, if the truth be known, I had picked the wrong XI to start with.\n\nIf I really was such a genius, I would have started with a different XI and got it right at the beginning.\n\nImmediately after full-time, I was always quick to move on, whatever the result.\n\nI would always explain to the players on Monday if I needed to get things off my chest about their performances.\n\nIt is always the manager who gets more of a grilling at full-time - many questions always followed the end of each Premier League fixture, with the agenda driven by the result.\n\nAs a manager, you are thrust almost immediately into the jaws of our unforgiving media and questions about tactics, substitutions and your team's overall performance are fired at you, sometimes under severe pressure.\n\nObviously the more damning investigations are aimed at the losing team's manager, where it is more than likely the questions are preordained.\n\nFor the winner, there are plaudits - but whatever the outcome, you have to think forwards not back.\n\nI was soon back in my car and heading home... thinking about the next match.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "fullText": "Brad Currie's biography on social media platform X reads: \"21/22 OR: 1k. 22/23 OR: 1.8k.\"\n\nHe will likely open the bowling for Scotland against England at the T20 World Cup on Saturday, but those numbers do not reference his cricket stats.\n\nInstead, they are Currie's record playing Fantasy Football because online he is known by another name, 'FPL Schofield'.\n\nThere he runs an account with thousands of followers offering tips and tactics on the online football game.\n\n\"My notes page on my iPad is filled with FPL transfers and fixtures rotations,\" Currie tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"My YouTube algorithm is just FPL videos galore. My Twitter is nothing other than football and even my TikTok.\n\n\"My girlfriend absolutely hates it.\"\n\nLeask & Munsey star as Scotland beat debutants Italy\n\nScotland beaten by West Indies in T20 World Cup opener\n\nThe Office, Willy Wonka & Denmark at Euro 92 - Scotland's chaotic WC prep\n\nCurrie, 27, was once ranked 30th in the world in a game now played by almost 13 million people.\n\nPlaying a World Cup in India comes with one obvious problem - the five-and-a-half-hour time difference to the UK.\n\nThis week's Premier League matches kicked off in the early hours and the deadlines to make transfers were late at night.\n\n\"I can't figure out a way to get the games on and I am even struggling to see highlights.\n\n\"It has been absolute torture, but thankfully it is the FA Cup this weekend.\"\n\nThough the secret has started to come out, the professional cricket world was initially unaware of Currie's alter ego.\n\nThese days he gets messages from team-mates and opponents asking for advice.\n\n\"[Sussex bowler] Sean Hunt is one,\" Currie says.\n\n\"He messaged me a screenshot before our West Indies game and said: 'I know you have bigger things at play, but what do you think of my team?'\n\n\"The other day he said: 'What do you think of my team? Oh and well bowled.'\"\n\nSo what about a tip for the rest of the FPL season?\n\n\"Chip strategy,\" Currie replies quickly. \"Dead-end into Gameweek 31. Wildcard in 32. Bench boost 33.\n\n\"Triple captain whenever you want.\"\n\nCurrie is the brother of Scott - the Scotland bowler who was called up by England last year.\n\nThey both qualify for Scotland via their Scottish dad, having grown up on England's south coast. Left-armer Brad studied sports psychology at Bournemouth University.\n\nA lifelong fan, Brad was at the Cherries' 3-2 win over Liverpool at the Vitality Stadium - when Amine Adli scored a 95th-minute winner against the Premier League champions - the day he got the call from coach Owen Dawkins to tell him he had made Scotland's World Cup squad.\n\n\"I said to my mate: 'I know exactly what this is, but I can't pick this up because I won't get any signal,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I got to the phone later and Dawks said: 'That was a good result, wasn't it?'\n\n\"I said: 'Yeah, and I hope you're not going to ruin my mood now.'\"\n\nHaving been pipped at qualifying by the Netherlands and Italy, Scotland got a place at this World Cup when Bangladesh opted to boycott the tournament.\n\nThe preceding weeks were uncertain, filled with claims and counterclaims about whether the Tigers would take part and what it would mean for Scotland if they did not. Even the players were not immune.\n\n\"I was at Sussex training in the indoor school and was asking all of the powers that be and the coaching staff,\" Currie says.\n\n\"It was crazy to have people saying we were going. I just thought, 'you know more than me and I am one of the players in the official Scotland group chat'.\"\n\nAs a county pro at Sussex, Currie was fortunate he had been training through the winter.\n\nBowlers' workloads are notoriously important to manage, however, and Scotland's focus switched from the Cricket World Cup League 2 at the end of March to a T20 World Cup in India at the start of February.\n\n\"I don't know what date it officially got announced but the two days after were the weekend and I just did nothing,\" he says.\n\n\"My girlfriend's family were like: 'Should you not be training? Should you not be doing something?'\n\n\"You can't cram in. You just will get injured. It is not like a school test where you can cram in revision.\"\n\nUncertainty also surrounded the availability of the younger Currie brother.\n\nDespite being picked by England for the tour of Ireland last year, he did not make his debut, leaving some to wonder if he could switch back to the Scots.\n\nAs it turned out, one spell as a substitute fielder made him ineligible.\n\n\"I had to text him and ask,\" Brad says.\n\n\"My heart sank because there are loads of brothers out here playing.\n\n\"We have just played the Manentis and the Moscas [against Italy]. There's the Sheikh brothers [Nepal] as well.\n\n\"It probably would have forced Mum and Dad to remortgage the house and get some flights out but there's only one son out here so it's not needed.\n\n\"He is going to try and please Mum and play for England, but I am going to keep Dad sweet and stick to my Scottish genes.\"\n\nEngland's defeat by West Indies effectively means Saturday's encounter is a must-win for both sides.\n\nThey last met at the 2024 T20 World Cup when an impressive Scotland batting performance meant England were faced with a tricky 110 in 10 overs before rain prevented what could have been an intriguing situation.\n\n\"It is something we will never have the answer to,\" Currie says.\n\n\"I have learned to fear no one and go into games expecting to win.\n\n\"I have a fair background in sports psychology and that is the best way to approach these games.\n\n\"They have Adil Rashid [batting] at 11 with 10 first-class hundreds and I haven't got a first-class double-digit score. I am not naive.\n\n\"[But] They have got to play and travel. We have played two games at Eden Gardens.\n\n\"I am just looking forward to it.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

However, it's still a major loss, as the value will likely never be fully recouped. CNN reported that as of 2023, it was being dismantled, with most of the valuable parts, including the engines, already removed.\n\n\"[The engines] were effectively brand new, and one of them is probably in the region of $20 million, so four would be in the region of $80 million,\" Connor Diver, a senior analyst at aviation analytics firm Cirium, told CNN.\n\nRichard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at AeroDynamic Advisory, told the news outlet that many components will likely be reused in cargo planes.

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — A coalition of major trade unions and farmers’ groups in India mounted a nationwide strike Thursday to protest an interim trade deal with the United States, saying the agreement undermines the interests of farmers, small businesses and workers.\n\nIn parliament, lawmakers from opposition political parties demanded that the government scrap the trade deal and criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the slogan “Narendra Modi, surrender Modi.”\n\nThe one-day strike partially disrupted public services and manufacturing activities, highlighting resistance to the reform agenda set by Modi, leader of the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, and underscoring the political risks of pushing market-oriented policies before key state elections later this year.\n\nIn New Delhi, a protesting farmer activist, Hannan Mollah, said that India's recent free trade agreements with New Zealand, Europe and now the U.S. were poised to ruin India's farm sector as the local markets would be inundated by cheaper products.\n\n“The fight will go on till our demands are met,\" Mollah said \"If not, the public will gather in large numbers and uproot the Modi government.\"\n\nA union leader said that the trade deal with Washington opens the Indian market to subsidized agricultural products, threatening the livelihoods of millions of small farmers.\n\n“Cheap American farm produce will be dumped in India, making it difficult for our farmers and small businesses to compete,” said Amarjeet Kaur, general-secretary of All India Trade Union Congress, a prominent union that took part in the strike.\n\nThe government in New Delhi has defended the interim trade pact as a step toward expanding exports, attracting investments and strengthening strategic ties with the U.S. The interests of farmers in the agriculture and dairy sectors were protected, Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said recently.\n\nIndia and the U.S. announced this month that they were moving closer to a formal trade pact, releasing an interim framework that would lower tariffs and deepen economic ties.\n\nA fact sheet issued by the White House shows reciprocal tariff on Indian goods decreasing from 25% to 18%, while an additional 25% penalty tariff for India's purchase of Russian oil will be dropped.\n\nIn return, India will stop buying Russian oil and purchase $500 billion worth of U.S. goods, including energy, while cutting taxes and non-tariff barriers.\n\nThe protesters in India also opposed Modi’s efforts to privatize state-run companies and implement new labor codes, calling the sweeping changes “deceptive fraud” against workers.\n\nIndian officials have argued that labor reforms were needed to boost efficiency and create jobs in the long run.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is dramatically expanding an effort to revoke U.S. citizenship for foreign-born Americans as it works to curb immigration, according to two people familiar with the plans.\n\nOver the past several months, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that’s responsible for legal immigration, has been sending experts to its offices around the country or reassigning staff members to focus on whether some citizens processed through those offices could now be denaturalized, these people said.\n\nThe goal of emphasizing naturalized citizens is to supply the office of immigration litigation with 100 to 200 possible cases per month, one of the people familiar with the plans said. Such cases have typically been very rare, involving people who concealed criminal histories or previous human rights violations during their application processes. The New York Times first reported the quota.\n\nThe effort is part of the overall push by Homeland Security to drastically curtail immigration and deliver on Trump’s policy agenda. The push has included DHS’ sending scores of immigration enforcement officers into U.S. cities on deportation missions and purchasing mega warehouses to hold detainees.\n\nDHS has also increasingly sought to remove legal immigrants from the U.S. by revoking thousands of visas, including for some people who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, and trying to deport green card holders.\n\nA spokesman for USCIS, Matthew Tragesser, said the agency reviews cases of naturalized citizens when there is credible evidence that citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation.\n\n“We maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards fraud in the naturalization process and will pursue denaturalization proceedings for any individual who lied or misrepresented themselves,” he said. “We will continue to relentlessly pursue those undermining the integrity of America’s immigration system and work alongside the Department of Justice to ensure that only those who meet citizenship standards retain the privilege of U.S. citizenship.”\n\nTrump administration officials are looking for shortcuts to speed up the process, the two people familiar with the plans said. USCIS officials have concluded that dedicating staff members, either by sending experts or by training them across the agency’s 80-plus field offices nationwide, would be more effective in rooting out more cases than the previous Trump effort, headquartered in a warehouse in Pasadena, California, they said.\n\nThe Justice Department has already told attorneys to focus on denaturalization cases, and it has offered possible case examples, from “individuals who pose a risk to national security” or who have engaged in war crimes or torture to people who have committed Medicaid or Medicare fraud or have otherwise defrauded the government.\n\nThere is also a broad catch-all provision that refers to “any other cases ... that the division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue.”\n\nOften the cases go on beyond a presidential administration. According to Justice Department figures, the Trump administration won 86 cases during Trump’s first term. During the Biden administration, 54 cases were won.\n\nTrump has long been preoccupied with the notion of citizenship — who gets to be an American and who doesn’t — and has expressed displeasure with immigrants from what he calls third world nations. He is separately seeking the power to strip citizenship from those born to foreigners in the U.S., though “birthright citizenship” appears in the Constitution. The Supreme Court is weighing his argument.\n\nTrump’s Truth Social message to Americans on Thanksgiving Day last year was that he would remove anyone who wasn’t a “net asset” to the U.S. “or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.”\n\nRoughly 800,000 people become naturalized citizens every year, according to DHS. To become a naturalized citizen, a candidate must be over 18, already be a legal permanent resident, speak English, know U.S. history and social studies and have “good moral character,” according to the Immigration and Naturalization Act.\n\nForeign-born Americans were generally stripped of citizenship only if they were found to have committed fraud during their application processes. In past decades, those cases focused on ferreting out former Nazis who fled to the U.S. after World War II under false pretenses. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have sought to increase investigations, but it’s still rare for a reason, a former USCIS official said.\n\n“It’s so important for current and future naturalized U.S. citizens to know that no president can unilaterally strip people of the citizenship they’ve worked so hard to earn,” said Doug Rand, another former USCIS official.\n\nThe denaturalization process is lengthy and time-consuming, and there is a high legal bar. Even if the administration makes the push to investigate someone with the aim to denaturalize, it could take years, and a subsequent deportation would take even longer.\n\n“Denaturalization is a significant tool that should be used in rare cases,” said Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst who was a USCIS official under former President Joe Biden.\n\nPierce said USCIS has a lot of discretion when it decides to approve someone for naturalization, so it’s possible that someone who had no issues flagged upon becoming a citizen could face additional scrutiny now.\n\nShe said there were concerns that some of the Trump administration’s immigration policy changes could “make some naturalized citizens vulnerable to claims of fraud or misrepresentation retroactively.”\n\nRepublican lawmakers recently introduced a bill that would allow the government to strip citizenship from anyone found to have committed fraud against the government or joined a terrorist group or anyone who is convicted of a serious felony within 10 years of their citizenship.\n\nSo far in Trump’s second term, 16 cases have been filed and the administration has won seven, including one case involving a man originally from the United Kingdom who had been convicted of receiving and distributing sexually explicit images of children.\n\nDeborah Chen, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group’s immigrant protection services program, said some clients who had pending naturalization applications when the new policies went into effect were denied because they owed taxes, even though they were on payment plans.\n\nShe added that it could signal that immigration officers may be seeking more proof of “good moral character,” which they prove by showing “positive attributes,” such as family caregiving, educational attainment, stable employment and community involvement.\n\nThere are growing concerns that the DHS effort is more about creating fear and less about successfully stripping citizenship. Even if Americans swept up in investigations aren’t prosecuted or convicted, the process takes a financial and emotional toll; they’d have to hire lawyers and produce documents.\n\nMargy O’Herron, a senior fellow in the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, said the mere threat of denaturalization creates real terror.\n\n“Citizens are afraid that if they do or say something the government doesn’t like — even if those things are lawful and protected by the Constitution — they will be a target,” she said.\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "description": "After 11 years away, fallen giants Bradford Bulls return to Super League in 2026 aiming to rekindle past glories.",
    "fullText": "A previous version of this story was published on 16 October 2025 after Bradford Bulls' return to Super League for 2026 was confirmed.\n\nLove them or hate them, Bradford Bulls are a club that certainly generate opinion in rugby league circles.\n\nThey also have a rare quality, a pull beyond the usual horizons, a brand that even laypeople can associate with, however faded the memory.\n\nAfter 11 years away from Super League, time in which the club were liquidated, reborn, revived and finally returned, the Bulls will run with the elite again in 2026.\n\nFor a support starved of the top table it will feel special; a club that once posted a 24,000-plus attendance for a derby with Leeds Rhinos - that is another factor to savour - can again sing its name proudly under the spotlight.\n\nHead coach Kurt Haggerty is the man tasked with guiding Bulls on their return, which starts away to Hull FC on Saturday, and all the expectation that comes with being at a former champion club.\n\n\"We're the new era Bulls, we're on our own journey,\" Haggerty told BBC Sport. \"I'm very careful when using the history and the narrative with the players as I don't want to put that pressure on them.\n\n\"But we do have to acknowledge it, we have to celebrate it at certain times. Regards pressure, we're all pretty cool.\"\n\nBradford replace Salford in Super League for 2026\n\nBurnham & Dennett speak to RFL over Salford plight\n\nWhat are IMG gradings and how do they work?\n\nThe sheer drop from being one of the game's major players to a side rebuilt in the bottom tier has taken some of the edge away from Bradford's claim to be a powerhouse.\n\nIt had an effect on the fanbase, the type of player they were able to recruit, and their sway with investors.\n\nHowever, any fears of the Bulls sliding back into their prior demise have been allayed thanks to the investment of a passionate board, and the club-at-heart mentality of chief executive and hometown fan Jason Hirst.\n\nTheir foundation carries the important role of spreading the sport to a new audience, while partnerships with amateur clubs in the area are also a vital way of establishing links with the community.\n\nOff the field, Bulls have consistently turned a profit in recent seasons, while on it there has been careful rebuilding by a string of coaches starting with John Kear, who brought them back from the League One doldrums and restored pride at Odsal, before Mark Dunning maintained the upward curve.\n\nUp until the end of last season, former boss Brian Noble - who led Bulls to multiple major trophies during their heyday - was brought back after highly-rated Eamon O'Carroll was snared by St Helens to join their staff, and Noble's legacy as a Bradford legend helped restore some of their DNA, passion and professionalism.\n\nNow the reins are to be entrusted to another excellent young coach in Haggerty, who served his apprenticeship at Toronto Wolfpack, Leigh and Salford Red Devils before taking this job.\n\n\"I couldn't be prouder, but it's for people like Jason, Brian and the board of directors, the journey they've gone through to get this club into Super League is pretty amazing,\" Haggerty added.\n\nIf 'franchising' via grading is the way to go in climbing up the pyramid, Bradford have carefully ensured they ticked the boxes to achieve it, culminating in their selection in October as the most suitable club to replace crisis-plagued Salford in this season's Super League.\n\nMost rival fans, even begrudgingly, cannot fail to be impressed by Bradford's rebirth and the progress made.\n\nThat said, while Odsal Stadium has a history as rich and storied as any of Bradford's legendary players, the venue which opened in 1934 had been showing its age.\n\nFor large parts it is a huge, open-air bowl with vast concrete terracing cascading down to the pitch, and work has been done in installing a big screen, LED advertising hoardings, and extending the TV gantry, among other developments.\n\nInvestment has been made in trying to make the setting a fitting one ready for their first home game against Catalans Dragons on Friday, 20 February.\n\n\"It will be a really emotional day for a lot of people,\" Haggerty said.\n\n\"This is the first game back in Super League at Odsal, we're playing against a French team which adds a little bit of incentive to us.\"\n\nThere will always be quibbles with Odsal given its age and sheer size, while there is still some uncertainty over the pitch which in the past has been impacted by the dual use of the venue as a motorsport track.\n\nWhen captain Jamie Peacock thrust the Super League trophy into the air at a packed Old Trafford in October 2005, it proved a turning point - and perhaps a zenith - for Bradford Bulls.\n\nTheir fourth title in just nine years was to be their last to date, as stars such as Peacock, Robbie Hunter-Paul and Leon Pryce all departed and the key components of 'Bullmania' began to slip away.\n\nHow does this new-look Bradford seek to re-establish itself among the top dogs in the competition?\n\nRecruitment had to be accelerated, given the late nature of the announcement of their acceptance back into the top flight, particularly with Toulouse and York also shopping for new talent on the back of their promotions.\n\nAmong the headline arrivals were hooker Andy Ackers, signed from Leeds, English prop Ryan Sutton, whose most recent club was Gold Coast Titans, as well as Jayden Nikorima and Loghan Lewis, who both arrived after leaving Salford.\n\n\"What I found as the head coach was you'd be surprised how many people want to play for Bradford,\" Haggerty continued.\n\n\"There was a window of about two and a half to three weeks where once we were officially in Super League we had to strike really, really quickly.\n\n\"It was a really nervy time, but I think we've done some good business in a short space of time.\"\n\nNot that much has changed since they went away.\n\nAfter all, Hull KR's 2025 triumph made them only the fifth team to win the competition - the fourth had been way back in 2004 when Bulls lost to allow Leeds to join the title-winning club.\n\nYet it is Hull KR that Bradford can gain heart from. They too had to rebuild and regroup back in 2016 when they were relegated via the Million Pound Game and were promoted a year later.\n\nThe Robins have shifted from perennial strugglers to champions, doing so by establishing a core of hungry players, initially to set the culture, and appointing a shrewd, driving force coach in Willie Peters.\n\nNow that core in Elliot Minchella - coincidentally a Bradford lad signed from the Bulls - Jez Litten and Dean Hadley provide the heart, lifeblood and spirit of the team, while Mikey Lewis has grown from young talent to world-class star in that environment.\n\nRovers have given heart to everyone, and smashed the big-four ceiling.\n\nAlbeit they are part of that illustrious five, Bradford fans will need to be patient, but the promise is there as a business and a club if they get things right.",

    "description": "Thousands of tickets remain unsold, with one club chairman saying the matches are not worth it.",
    "fullText": "Tens of thousands of tickets for Wales' three home fixtures in this year's Six Nations have still not been sold.\n\nThe matches at Cardiff's 74,000-seat Principality Stadium usually sell out or reach high capacity for a tournament that has traditionally been a highlight of the Welsh sporting calendar.\n\nOn Friday morning there were 15,300 unsold for Sunday's clash with France; 6,700 left for Scotland and 27,000 for Italy's visit in March, according to the WRU's official ticket site.\n\nThe WRU said buying habits have changed and tickets have been selling at a rate of 1,000 a day this week.\n\nNumbers of empty seats could potentially be higher on Sunday with clubs who are given an allocation of tickets, including Swansea, Llandaff North and Machen, trying to shift tickets on social media over the past week.\n\nWith tickets costing between £40 and £120, one club chairman said \"it's not worth it\".\n\nSports economist Prof Calvin Jones said: \"Obviously the Six Nations is the jewel in the crown of rugby in certain Welsh terms, and for France, the favourites probably for the tournament, it's a really big match.\n\n\"I can't remember in my 30 years as a sports economist this [so many unsold tickets] happening before.\"\n\nWelsh rugby is in turmoil on and off the pitch.\n\nThe team lost 19 games in a row before beating Japan last summer, while they have not won in the Six Nations since 2023.\n\nOff the pitch, there is a bitter feud over the future of the regional game, with the leader of Swansea council threatening the WRU with legal action, and businesswoman Hayley Parsons calling on clubs to oust the chairman to instigate a change of direction.\n\nJones said a Six Nations with low ticket sales would not be a disaster if it was a one-off.\n\nBut he added: \"The stadium is absolutely mission critical to Welsh rugby, that's where the money now comes from given the declining rates for regional rugby that we've seen in the last 20 or 30 years.\n\n\"The WRU has done a very good job of diversifying again in terms of more concerts, cultural events and so on, but the stadium needs to work for Welsh rugby to work.\n\n\"So if this was to become a longer term problem, then you'd be really worried about financial viability of the whole game.\"\n\nHe said there was a need to \"rebuild trust between the various bits of rugby and Wales\".\n\nSunday's match comes off the back of a 48-7 defeat to England in the opening round of Six Nations fixtures.\n\nPenarth RFC's chairman Sean O'Sullivan said the cost of tickets was \"not worth it\" for some fans, adding: \"As a family we are going skiing in Poland for two days and it's not costing us much more than going to Cardiff, with meals and drinks.\n\n\"This trip is costing us about 20 to 30% more than we have spent before [on rugby days in Cardiff].\n\n\"Watching other teams play is like watching a different sport.\n\n\"The excitement will be if a team like Italy does well not Wales.\"\n\nO'Sullivan has seen a \"steady demise\" in demand for tickets bought through his club.\n\nEight years ago, Penarth RFC would have taken every ticket available to them, but because of the cost rising, they have in the past struggled to sell them all.\n\nHe said they are not the only ones: \"You have some clubs who have had to flog their tickets outside the stadium on the day.\"\n\nHe believes cost and the quality of performance have combined, adding: \"If you're taking 10-year-old kids to the game you are going for the atmosphere not necessarily for the game.\n\n\"It's an expensive day out. You can go to Paris for the same money.\"\n\nMore than 50% the WRU's turnover comes from the gate receipts of the men's home internationals in Cardiff.\n\nThe financial loss from empty seats is hard to quantify, as prices vary per game and there are concessions, such as student discounts.\n\nThe lowest crowd for a Wales home Six Nations game against France came in 2022 when 63,208 attended a Friday night game.\n\nOverall, the smallest attendance in the tournament at the Principality Stadium was 58,349 against Italy in 2002.\n\nTwo years ago, the same Wales v France fixture was held on a Sunday and attracted a crowd of 71,242.\n\nIn Gwynedd, there was sadness but not surprise at the situation.\n\n\"They're not doing very well. it's a shame really and its hard to watch,\" said Gwenda Harding, from Llanberis.\n\n\"You try and support them through thick and thin. If you're a true supporter it's hard to take because they're losing all the time and not playing very well.\n\n\"A one-off [is acceptable] but they haven't altered for the last year really.\"\n\nGareth Jones, from Caernarfon, added: \"When you see the performances they have done over the last two years it's not been too good. I wouldn't pay £85 for a ticket, it's not for me.\n\n\"[Football] has grown and grown and grown. Tickets have sold out in abundance. You could fill the Principality Stadium twice over.\"\n\nWRU chief operating officer Gavin Marshall said: \"Ticket-buying habits are undoubtedly changing and sales have sped up since the start of the Guinness Six Nations, with run rates reaching over 1,000 a day this week.\n\n\"We have some of the most loyal fans in the world in Wales and we know they will be in good voice on Sunday, for the acapella anthem and beyond, to help make home advantage count in what will obviously be a huge contest for us.\n\n\"We always work hard to fill Principality Stadium to its rafters and we are confident the expected attendance will make for another incredible match day experience for all involved.\"\n\nAdditonal reporting by Matthew Richards and Gareth Wyn Williams.",

    "fullText": "Uefa referees' chief Roberto Rosetti says video assistant review (VAR) is becoming too forensic.\n\nSpeaking at the Uefa Congress on Thursday, Rosetti added that a lot of work is needed to find a \"consistent interpretation\" on handball.\n\nRosetti admitted that technology works very well for factual decisions like offside, but subjective situations are leading to too many interventions.\n\nThe Premier League has the lowest VAR intervention rate in Europe's top leagues this season, at 0.27 per game - although fewer reviews has not led to less controversy over decisions.\n\nThe Bundesliga and La Liga come next at 0.38, Serie A at 0.44 and Ligue 1 at 0.47.\n\nIn the Champions League the ratio is also high, at 0.45.\n\n\"At the end of the season we need to speak about this,\" Rosetti said. \"Because we cannot go in this direction of microscopic VAR interventions. We love football like it is.\"\n\nRosetti said part of the problem had been supporters and media asking \"where is VAR?\" on an increasing number of subjective decisions.\n\n\"We cannot forget why it is in place,\" he said. \"It's about justice.\n\n\"It's good for fans, for everyone, because you want the right decisions in the pitch, especially when they're clear.\"\n\nRosetti added that European football must speak \"only one technical language\" on handball.\n\nInterpretation differs widely across leagues, with the Premier League operating one of the more lenient approaches.\n\n\"We cannot speak different technical languages across Europe,\" Rosetti said. \"It's not good. It's not good also because teams are playing in European competitions.\n\n\"We are speaking a lot about it. For sure, before next season, we need to speak again.\n\n\"Only one uniformity and consistent interpretation. We are working for this.\"\n\nRosetti hinted he was against extending the remit of VAR. The International Football Association Board is expected to approve review for corners and second yellow cards when it meets on 28 February.\n\n\"What is crucial is one concept, we cannot delay the restart of play,\" he added. \"If something is in place to delay the restart of play, I think it's not good for football.\n\n\"I can tell you also that every little change in order to speed up the restart of play, we like.\n\n\"We like because football is intensity, is emotions, is not delaying the restart of play.\"\n\nRosetti said that at a meeting of Europe's top referees last month there was a focus on players going to ground too easily from minimal contact.\n\nOfficials have also been told to monitor blocking actions on goalkeepers on corners when it clearly prevents them from playing the ball.\n\nRosetti added that he had reservations about former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's proposed offside change, which would require daylight between attacker and defender.\n\nHe said it would create a \"big space\" for the attacker and could have tactical impacts.\n\nSubject to approval at the IFAB meeting, the idea is set to be trialled in the Canadian Premier League from April.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

I ran up the stairs. My mum was on the phone, and I told her.\n\n\"She looked at me like 'is that meant to be a good thing?'.\n\n\"But she then became the biggest rugby fan.

    "description": "Investors are bracing for a report on the consumer price index for January, a key input for Fed policy making on rates.",
    "fullText": "US stock futures slid on Friday, eyeing more losses after a broad market sell-off as Wall Street waited for the latest reading on consumer inflation for a steer on the path of interest rates.\n\nContracts on the S&P 500 (ES=F) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) both dropped roughly 0.4%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) fell 0.3%, signaling a return of pressure on techs.\n\nCaution prevails after a day of heavy selling as fears about AI disruption spilled into sectors such as real estate, logistics, and transportation — \"old economy\" names previously seen as a safe alternative to AI-tied stocks. Techs got pummeled, with all seven of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps finishing lower.\n\nThat looks set to resumer as investors scrutinize the latest earnings for the next \"shoot first, ask questions later\" AI scare. Applied Materials (AMAT) stock surged over 10% as the chip toolmaker's upbeat outlook mirrored robust AI demand. But Pinterest (PINS) shares tumbled about 20% as revenue fell short and analysts fretted about AI risks to its discovery platform.\n\nMarkets are also bracing with Friday morning's report on January's consumer price index, the inflation measure favored by the Federal Reserve in policy making. The key inflation measure is likely to shape expectations for an already complicated Federal Reserve policy.\n\nThe slightly delayed data will shed light on whether price pressures are turning less stubbornly sticky to start 2026. Expectations are for a slowing in the annual CPI rate to around 2.5%, and any surprise is likely to shape already complicated calculations for the path of interest rates.\n\nOn the earnings front, Rivian (RIVN) shares jumped almost 20% following its fourth quarter earnings beat late Thursday. The EV maker said its R2 midsize model is on track for delivery before the summer. Before the bell, eyes are on Moderna's (MRNA) report, after it suffered a 10% drop in share value this week as the FDA rejected a new flu vaccine.\n\nWall Street’s fears of business disruption caused by artificial intelligence are turning into a blessing for Asian stocks, fueling demand for the region’s leading chipmakers that dominate the industry’s supply chain.\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index has risen more than 12% in 2026, in contrast to losses in US benchmarks as shares were sold off on fears that AI models may threaten the business of software, legal and real estate service providers. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is down 0.2% for the year, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) gauge has lost around 2%.\n\nThe divergence underscores global funds’ shift of preference from AI pioneers burdened by massive spending toward hardware producers with strong pricing power, many of whom are in Asia. Surging memory chip prices have been a boon for the region’s heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.KS, SSNLF), while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSM, 2330.TW) irreplaceable role as the world’s leading contract chipmaker has provided support for Taiwanese stocks.\n\n“The main worry of the US is hyperscaler spending money,” said Richard Tang, head of research Hong Kong at Julius Baer. “Most of Asia’s tech exposure is upstream. Whoever wins in the end, upstream will still collect revenue from downstream players.”\n\nRivian (RIVN) stock soared 19% during premarket hours on Friday following the release of better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Thursday.\n\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) stock climbed 11% during premarket hours on Friday after the ⁠semiconductor equipment maker beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nThe after-hours reaction to Applied Materials' results added to the strong run for the stock in 2026.

GEORGE, Utah (ABC4) — Recently unsealed documents are revealing more about the investigation into a BYU receiver who was charged with rape Tuesday.\n\nParker Kingston, 21, a wide receiver for Brigham Young University, was formally charged with one count of felony rape in Washington County. A judge granted a motion Thursday to unseal the case, revealing additional details of the investigation.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, detectives with the St. George Police Department first became aware of the alleged sexual assault after a 20-year-old woman contacted officers at the St. George Regional Hospital on Feb. 27, 2025.\n\nPAST COVERAGE: BYU receiver charged with felony rape in Washington County\n\nThe alleged victim met with a forensic interviewer with the Washington County Attorney’s Office months later on June 3. During the interview, law enforcement says she disclosed “online communication” where she told Kingston multiple times, she did not want to have sex with him.\n\nDocuments show she set clear boundaries with Kingston prior to their meetup.\n\nShe also told officers Kingston had arrived at her home early in the morning on Feb. 23, 2025, where the two watched a movie together. During the movie, police say she engaged in “some sexual activity,” but did not have intercourse.\n\nAfterwards, documents indicate Kingston started to fall asleep and the woman left the room to get ready for bed. When she returned about 15 minutes later, Kingston allegedly initiated sexual activity again.\n\nPolice say the woman told Kingston to “stop several times” and even tried to push him off of her before he allegedly raped her.\n\nIn an interview with Kingston, police say the football player claimed all activity was consensual.\n\n“Based on communications obtained from Kingston’s cell phone after the incident, it can be inferred that he went to her apartment with the intention of having sexual intercourse,” police said in the affidavit.\n\nThe Washington County Attorney’s Office told ABC4 BYU Police assisted detectives in executing search warrants and gathering information during the “later stages” of the investigation.\n\nKingston is expected to appear before a judge on Friday, Feb. 13, for an initial appearance.\n\nCharges are allegations only. All arrested persons are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nCongress barrels toward Homeland Security shutdown without off-ramp in sight\n\nDemocrats’ tariff gambit sparks new headaches for Mike Johnson\n\nLehi tests longer light cycles on Triumph Blvd, neighbors push back over backups\n\nHGTV’s ‘Rehab Addict’ Nicole Curtis filmed saying racial slur, gets fired\n\nGoldman Sachs’ top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler to resign after emails show close ties to Jeffrey Epstein",

    "fullText": "Team GB's men were left to rue a shocking first end as a stubborn fightback against hosts Italy in a throbbing Cortina Curling Stadium was not enough to prevent their first defeat of these Winter Olympics.\n\nAfter winning their opening two matches, including against the Swedish rink who beat them in the gold-medal match four years ago, the British team went into their second high-grade encounter in two days in a strong position.\n\nHowever, a horrendous first end - during which the Italians stole four points - left them chasing in front of a raucous home crowd armed with horns, bells and whistles.\n\nThese British players are the world's top-ranked rink for a reason though, and they slowly reeled in Italy, levelling in the ninth end.\n\nHowever, the local favourites held firm in the last to win 9-7 and add the scalp of GB to that of the Swedes, who they beat in their opener.\n\n\"We had to dig deep and we played nine really good ends and controlled it from there, but we just couldn't do enough to get the win,\" lead Hammy McMillan told BBC Sport.\n\nSeven wins from the nine round-robin matches will guarantee a place in the semi-finals - fewer may well still be sufficient - so Bruce Mouat's rink are still in a strong spot.\n\nGB's women are next on the ice, playing their second match against South Korea at 13:05 GMT. The men will return to the rink on Saturday, when they face the Czech Republic, also at 13:05.\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nThe horrified looks on the faces of the GB curlers said more than words could about that appalling opening end.\n\nLying one as Mouat threw his final stone, they took a risk in an attempt to claim two, but could not have anticipated just how badly it would go. An unfortunate kiss left none of their red stones in the house but four yellow Italian ones in position.\n\nThat might have caused some rinks to unravel but this Scottish quartet are the world's best, and soon righted themselves.\n\nThe sides traded singles before a fabulous final Mouat throw - aided by the intervention of the big compass to measure who was nearest the button - ensured GB claimed two to get back to 5-3.\n\nAnother splendid team shot - Mouat's throw, Grant Hardie's judgement, and the ferocious sweeping of Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie - forced a steal in the fourth and suddenly it was back to a one-point game at the break.\n\nThe Italians blanked the sixth, and claimed two in the seventh to open up a healthy advantage again. But Team GB roared back again with another two and remarkably levelled with one end to go after a steal.\n\nIt all came down to the final end but the Italians kept their nerve to edge to victory and cause a thunderous barrage of noise to roll down the wooden bleachers.\n\n\"It's pretty surreal, pretty cool,\" McMillan added. \"It's not a typical curling crowd - it's more like a football one. But it's an amazing atmosphere to play in and we're going to have to get used to it and enjoy it.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "A bipartisan group of 37 U.S. lawmakers have written to senior Taiwanese politicians expressing concern about parliament stalling proposed defence spending,",
    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 37 U.S. lawmakers have written to senior Taiwanese politicians expressing concern about parliament stalling proposed defence spending, saying that the threat posed by China has never ‌been greater.\n\nTaiwan President Lai Ching-te last year proposed $40 billion in extra defence spending to counter China, which views ‌the island as its own territory. But the opposition, which has a majority in parliament, has refused to review the proposal and instead advanced its own, less ​expensive proposals, which only fund the purchase of some of the U.S. weapons Lai wants.\n\nThe U.S. letter, addressed to Taiwan parliament speaker Han Kuo-yu, the heads of the opposition parties the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party, as well as the caucus whip for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said the United States and Taiwan shared a strong and enduring partnership.\n\n\"However, the threat posed by the People's Republic of China against ‌Taiwan has never been greater. Xi Jinping ⁠is focusing every element of the PRC's national power to control Taiwan,\" said the letter, released on Thursday and referring to China's president.\n\nThe U.S. must address the massive backlog in weapons deliveries to Taiwan, but ⁠Taiwan needs to step up too, the letter said.\n\n\"We commend Taiwan for making important progress in strengthening its military readiness, reserve forces, and asymmetric defence capabilities,\" it said.\n\n\"Nevertheless, we fear that without significant increases in Taiwan's defence spending at levels reflected in President Lai's proposed special budget, ​this ​progress will be insufficient.\"\n\nSignatories to the letter included Senators Pete Ricketts and Chris Coons, senior ​members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Young Kim ‌and Ami Bera, senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nSeveral U.S. lawmakers have already made public expressions of concern about the stalled budget.\n\nThe KMT, Taiwan's largest opposition party, said it sincerely appreciated the lawmakers' concern and that money spent on defence had to be used effectively.\n\n\"At the same time, the KMT urges members of the United States Congress to encourage the United States government to ensure timely delivery of weapons systems that Taiwan has already paid for or formally purchased,\" it added.\n\nThe TPP has ‌always supported a \"reasonable and steadily growing\" defence budget and understood U.S. concerns, ​it said in a statement, but added that spending requests had to be ​subject to democratic oversight and fiscal discipline.\n\nThe DPP said ​in a statement it agreed with the letter and hoped the recipients would read it \"thoroughly.\"\n\nThe delay in ‌passing the spending risks a \"rupture\" in the joint line ​of defence against China, Taiwan's ​defence minister said on Wednesday, as Lai again urged parliament to approve the spending measure.\n\nThe United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties.\n\nThe Trump administration has pressed its allies ​to increase defence spending, something Lai and ‌his government have enthusiastically embraced.\n\nChina has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. ​Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China, but been rebuffed, and says only Taiwan's people can decide their ​future.",

    "fullText": "Bitcoin’s “zero dollar theory” debate has intensified.\n\nIndustry has pushed the AI adoption thesis.\n\nInstitutional exposure continues to rise.\n\nFinancial Times columnist Jemima Kelly has come under fire after arguing that Bitcoin (BTC) has no inherent value, joining a growing chorus of analysts advancing the so-called “zero dollar theory.”\n\nKelly’s remarks, expanded on in a recent CNBC appearance, have prompted intense pushback from Bitcoin advocates and market commentators.\n\nThe dispute comes as major financial institutions continue to build exposure to crypto markets through regulated products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), even as a growing group of critics insists the underlying assets are ultimately worth nothing.\n\nKelly told CNBC she believed Bitcoin’s value was “zero,” arguing it has no intrinsic worth and that its scarcity narrative is undermined by the unlimited supply of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, Kelly said investors must continually accept the idea that Bitcoin is uniquely scarce despite the existence of competing tokens that can replicate or exceed its functionality.\n\nShe said Bitcoin’s market price has been supported in part by influential holders with a vested interest in promoting the asset, pointing to figures such as Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor.\n\nKelly also argued that Bitcoin proponents regularly introduce new narratives to sustain interest, citing claims that emerging technologies such as AI could drive fresh adoption.\n\n“I heard Anthony Pompliano on CNBC yesterday claiming that now all the AI agents are going to be using Bitcoin in crypto,” she said.\n\nPompliano, on Feb. 9, told CNBC that “both Bitcoin and stablecoins” were going to be the money “for all of these AI agents.”\n\nOther industry executives have echoed that view.\n\nCrypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek recently underscored the convergence of crypto and artificial intelligence with the $70 million purchase of the ai.com domain — one of the largest domain acquisitions on record.\n\nThe Ai.com platform, unveiled during a Super Bowl LX commercial on Feb. 8, promotes the idea of personal AI agents capable of executing transactions, organizing schedules and trading stocks, with crypto-based settlement embedded in the system.",

    "description": "One Air Force base's new mandated greetings for security personnel saw backlash, with troops and civilian workers calling them 'stupid.'",
    "fullText": "The Air Force is facing some backlash over new mandatory gate greetings.\n\nAltus Air Force Base personnel mocked gate guards over a scripted \"Victory begins here!\" greeting, an internal email shows.\n\nThe mandatory greetings are part of a broader cultural shift within the Air Force.\n\nGate guards at an Air Force base in Oklahoma have become targets of ridicule over a newly mandated greeting, according to an internal email.\n\nThe message, recently sent out by local senior enlisted leader MSgt. Bradley Opfar, warned against mocking the guards, known as Defenders, for delivering a scripted line: \"Good morning, sir/ma'am. Welcome to Altus AFB. Victory begins here!\"\n\n\"It frustrates me to write this to you all, but it is necessary,\" the email said. \"Anyone found disrespecting Defenders will be held accountable.\" The message warned that troops could face charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, while civilian employees could be reported to their supervisors.\n\nThe message included a sampling of the reactions that guards have faced at gates since February 4:\n\n\"You don't have to say that shit to me when I come through.\"\n\n\"You sound like a Walmart greeter.\"\n\nOthers have dismissed the greeting as \"stupid\" and \"dumb,\" according to the message, which the Air Force verified.\n\nA spokesperson for Altus Air Force Base told Business Insider that \"victory begins here\" is its \"base vision.\"\n\n\"We adhere to a culture of professionalism and respect for every person who comes on our base, which is emphasized by the new Air Force-wide policy,\" the spokesperson said, adding that \"disrespect toward any member of our community will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe base, located in Altus, Oklahoma, is home to courses that train pilots on one of the military's largest cargo aircraft, the C-17 Globemaster III, and another unit that trains personnel on notoriously complex refueling missions. Altus AFB supports roughly 2,000 permanent military personnel and employs a significant number of civilian workers.\n\nBusiness Insider wants to hear from soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who'd like to share their perspectives on cultural shifts within the military. Reach this reporter at kbaker@businessinsider.com or securely on Signal at kelseybaker75.75\n\nThe base started requiring the new greeting after Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach and the top enlisted airman, Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force David Wolfe, sent a memo on January 30 addressing base greetings.\n\n\"The way we greet one another matters,\" the memo said. \"Professional greetings — at installation entry control points and throughout interactions with the public — must be the standard. First impressions set the tone and when paired with professional image, reinforce trust, authority and pride.\"\n\nThat memo referenced another base where gate guards greet drivers by saying, \"Fight's on!\"\n\n\"At one of our premier bases, Defenders greet patrons with, 'Good Morning, Sir/Ma'am/General/Chief. Welcome to ____ AFB. Fight's On!\" the memo read.\n\n\"This simple phrase,\" it continued, \"signals entry onto a military installation protected by vigilant Defenders and reflects our identity within the profession of arms. Every installation should ensure professional greetings are constantly practiced.\"\n\nThe new mandates are the latest sign of what appears to be a broader cultural shift inside the Air Force. The service last year introduced new quarterly uniform and fitness inspections — later scaling them back to once a year — and tightened grooming standards.\n\nCorrection: February 12, 2026 — An earlier version of this article misstated David Wolfe's title. He is the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins signed right-handed reliever Julian Merryweather to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training on Wednesday, adding another veteran arm to what has been an ongoing bullpen rebuild.\n\nThe 34-year-old will head to Fort Myers as a non-roster invitee and compete for a spot on the big league roster.\n\nMerryweather was one of several moves the Twins made this week, as the club also signed former All-Star Liam Hendriks to a minor league deal and acquired left-hander Anthony Banda from the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nAll three moves point to an organization that knows it needs to rebuild its relief corps after last summer's trade deadline fire sale gutted the group.\n\nMerryweather has pitched parts of six big league seasons between the Toronto Blue Jays and Chicago Cubs, putting together a career 4.72 ERA across 158.1 innings.\n\nHis best year came in 2023 with the Cubs when he posted a 3.38 ERA and racked up 98 strikeouts in 72 innings out of the bullpen, showing off the kind of stuff that makes him worth a look on a low-risk deal.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins have signed Julian Merryweather to a minor league contract. The pitcher has a 3.92 ERA along with 426 strikeouts throughout his minor league career. The contract includes an invitation to major league spring training. pic.twitter.com/9FxaJzjXJH\n\n— Milb Central (@milb_central) February 13, 2026\n\nMerryweather features a fastball that sits in the mid-90s and can touch 97 mph, along with a solid slider that gives him a real weapon against right-handed hitters.\n\nThe last two seasons have been a different story, though.\n\nInjuries have slowed Merryweather down and his velocity has dipped, which led to a 6.15 ERA over just 33.2 innings combined in 2024 and 2025.\n\nLast season he made 21 appearances for the Cubs before being released at the end of May, and he spent the rest of the year bouncing between minor league stints with the Mets and Brewers.\n\nHe posted a 5.87 ERA across 23 innings in Triple-A, so there are real questions about whether he can get back to where he was.\n\nThe Twins are coming off a 70-92 season that saw them finish fourth in the AL Central, and the bullpen was a big part of the problem.\n\nMinnesota traded away key relievers like Jhoan Duran, Griffin Jax and Brock Stewart at the deadline last summer, leaving the group thin heading into 2026.\n\nRight now the only real locks for the pen are Taylor Rogers, Justin Topa, Cole Sands and Kody Funderburk, which means there is a wide open path for guys like Merryweather to fight their way onto the roster this spring.\n\nMerryweather still had some flashes in him last season. Another guy who could make the Opening Day roster if he has a healthy camp. https://t.co/lfsaaFci0P pic.twitter.com/6B1fwyupjl\n\n— Cody Pirkl (@CodyPirkl) February 12, 2026\n\nThat lack of depth is exactly what has made Minnesota an attractive landing spot for veteran arms on minor league deals.\n\nMerryweather joins a group of non-roster invitees that also includes Dan Altavilla, Matt Bowman and Grant Hartwig, all of whom will be looking to prove they belong.\n\nIf Merryweather can stay healthy and find his old fastball command, he has the kind of stuff that could play in the middle innings for a team that desperately needs pitching help heading into the new season.\n\nSpring training will tell the story. It is a low-risk move for the Twins, and for Merryweather it is a chance to prove that his 2023 breakout was not a fluke.",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Twins are bringing back a familiar face, signing veteran reliever Liam Hendriks to a minor league contract with an invitation to major league spring training.\n\nThe deal reunites Hendriks with the franchise that gave him his start in professional baseball, as the 37-year-old looks to continue one of the most inspiring comeback stories in recent memory.\n\nHendriks was originally signed by Minnesota as a non-drafted free agent out of Perth, Australia, back in 2007, and he made his big league debut at Target Field on September 6, 2011.\n\nHe spent parts of three seasons with the Twins as a starting pitcher but struggled to find his footing, posting a 6.06 ERA in 30 games before the club designated him for assignment.\n\nThey could never make me hate Liam Hendriks. pic.twitter.com/UxjCbHIYll\n\n— scott 🧦 (@FleecedByGetz) February 4, 2026\n\nAfter bouncing around with the Blue Jays, Royals, and Athletics, Hendriks made the switch to the bullpen and everything changed.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2022, he became one of the best closers in baseball, earning three All-Star selections while pitching for Oakland and the Chicago White Sox.\n\nOver that four-year stretch, he recorded 114 saves with a 2.26 ERA and averaged 13.5 strikeouts per nine innings.\n\nFor his career, Hendriks owns a 33-36 record with 116 saves and a 3.88 ERA across 490 games.\n\nThe Twins are coming off a rough 2025 campaign where they went 70-92 and finished fourth in the AL Central.\n\nMinnesota dealt away several key players at the trade deadline last summer, and the bullpen remains an area with plenty of question marks heading into 2026.\n\nLiam Hendriks takes the mound for the first time in 681 days 💛 pic.twitter.com/iLWyt7dZgw\n\nManager Derek Shelton acknowledged the team does not have a clear closer and needs more right-handed experience out of the pen.\n\nAdding a guy with Hendriks' resume on a no-risk minor league deal makes a lot of sense, especially when the pitching staff is still looking for answers across the board.\n\nIf Hendriks can get healthy and find anything close to his old form, he fills a massive need for a team trying to bounce back.\n\nThe simple answer is that the risk here is almost zero for the Twins.\n\nIt is a minor league deal, so the financial commitment is small, and Hendriks does not take up a spot on the 40-man roster unless the team decides to promote him.\n\nThat said, the concerns around his health are very real.\n\nHendriks has pitched just 18.2 innings over the last three seasons after battling non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Tommy John surgery, hip inflammation, and a nerve procedure in his elbow.\n\nLiam Hendriks was Twins minor league pitcher of the year in 2011. That offseason I ranked him as their #5 prospect.\n\nAs you can see from my write-up, I never could have imagined him becoming a hard-throwing All-Star closer.\n\nAnd neither could the Twins. They waived him at age 24. pic.twitter.com/8UePEjmBoX\n\n— Aaron Gleeman (@AaronGleeman) February 12, 2026\n\nHe appeared in only 14 games for the Red Sox in 2025, going 0-2 with a 6.59 ERA in 13.2 innings before his season ended early.\n\nThe worry is that Hendriks' body simply may not hold up, and leaning on him in a late-inning role could leave the Twins scrambling if he goes down again.\n\nStill, if there is anyone tough enough to make it work, it might be Hendriks.\n\nHis fight through cancer alone shows the kind of person he is, and the Twins are betting on that toughness to carry him through spring training and into a meaningful role in 2026. At worst, Minnesota loses nothing.\n\nAt best, they get a proven closer who can anchor the back end of a bullpen that badly needs one.",

    "fullText": "WEST HAVEN - In the first meeting of the battle of West Haven on Dec. 23, Notre Dame boys basketball jumped out to a quick lead and won by 35 points. Round two was a bit different.\n\nIn a five-point game with less than five minutes to go, the No. 1 Green Knights went on a 14-4 run to defeat No. 6 West Haven 72-57 at Notre Dame High School on Thursday evening.\n\nThe Green Knights, who have not lost at home since 2018, won their seventh straight contest to improve to 16-3. Notre Dame also extended its in-state win streak to 29, with its last loss coming at Hillhouse in January 2025.\n\nThe Green Knights had to do things a little differently against their rivals Thursday when star Abdou Toure picked up his third foul with 2:39 left in the first quarter and his fourth foul with 2:17 left in the third.\n\nWith Toure out, Kadrian Reeves picked up the slack with a team-high 20 points.\n\n\"I have been saying it for a long time,\" Notre Dame coach Jason Shea said. \"KK (Reeves) is one of the best three point guards in the state. We're not surprised by it. I think it's helped us the last five games without Abdou (Toure). We've been used to it, so I was very proud of him to step up in this game. He did a great job.\"\n\nThe frenetic pace of the Westies and the absence of Toure allowed West Haven to go into halftime even at 33. The Green Knights switched to a zone defense in the third quarter, and took a 55-49 lead to the fourth.\n\n\"Well, we came out in zone, which we haven't played much of all year, because of the foul trouble,\" Shea said of the third quarter. \"I thought we did a decent job of just slowing the pace and fouling less. That allowed us to get out on the break more. I thought we did a nice job at halftime.\"\n\nWest Haven did not get closer, as Toure entered the game with 4:31 remaining and the Green Knights closed the contest with their decisive run.\n\n\"Like I said in December, we are going to be a better team the next time we see them,\" West Haven coach Tyrese Sullivan said after his team's 13-game winning streak was snapped, falling to 16-2. \"When we see them again, we are going to be a better team, and when we see them again, we are going to be a better team. That's what I foresee.\n\n\"We'll be back. It's a regular season game that we wanted. I don't remember the last time anyone has won in here. The odds were stacked against us, and we were that close.\"\n\nThe Westies got as close as 62-57 on a bucket by Jordan Sirabionian, but the Green Knights scored the final 10 points of the game, including six by Landon Krygier to give him 1,002 points for his career.\n\nToure injured his quadricep in the first quarter against Branford on Jan. 21, sat the next four games, and returned to action in Notre Dame's last contest against Wilbur Cross.\n\nThe Notre Dame senior star, headed to Arkansas next season, finished with 11 points Thursday.\n\n\"We have enough depth,\" Shea said. \"We showed that the last five or six games, but we have shown that in the past. We've had these situations before. This group has been together for years. We've played without (Toure) because of foul trouble, and we've played without him when he's been hurt. We don't like playing without him, but we can do it. There are plenty of guys out there who can step up and make plays.\"\n\nReeves scored the first six points of the game, as the Green Knights jumped out to an 8-1 lead. The pesky Westies got to within 20-18 on a pair of free throws by Loshon Roman, but baskets by Eli Ssenyange and Quincy Dormevil extended the Notre Dame lead to six points.\n\n\"It was a rival game,\" Reeves said. \"We knew they were going to play hard. We came and responded to them playing hard first.\"\n\nA basket by Reeves and a 3-pointer by Toure started the third quarter, before a 3-pointer by Roman got West Haven as close as 42-39. A dunk by Aaron Johnson got West Haven to within 47-44 with 2:55 left in the third, but the Westies never got within three points again.\n\n\"We have a lot of depth on our team,\" Reeves said. \"We have eight seniors and some juniors. We just had to step up this game. Everybody had to step up.\"\n\nSirabionian had a game-high 24 points for West Haven, while Johnson finished with nine points.\n\nKrygier finished with 11 points for the Green Knights, and Ssenyange added nine.\n\nKadrian Reeves, Notre Dame: The junior finished with 20 points, including 13 in the third quarter when the Green Knights extended their lead.\n\n\"We've got 10 or 11 guys who can really make a difference in a game. We trust those guys, and we just go with the hot hands on any given night. I thought they did try to push tempo, but we're comfortable with that pace too. Tonight, it was just better for us to get settled in.\" - Notre Dame coach Jason Shea.\n\nWEST HAVEN           18 15 16   8-57\nND-WEST HAVEN    24   9 22 17-72\n\nWest Haven: Brandon Bellamy 0 1 0-0 3, K'naan Morris 1 2 0-0 8, Jordan Sirabionian 7 0 10-13 24, Loshon Roman 1 1 3-6 8, Aaron Johnson 3 1 0-0 9, Trew Kitson 1 0 1-2 3, Ricardo Harris 1 0 0-0 2.

Freshman Ty’Reek Coleman came off the bench to score 14 points and grab five rebounds for the Redbirds (17-9, 9-6).\n\nThe Redbirds had a 14-0 run in the second half and outscored the Beacons 32-12 in the game’s final 12 minutes. Kinziger made 7-of-15 shots from the floor in earning his season-high total of 21 points.\n\n“It feels good to see a couple shots go in. But my main role is to be a captain, a leader of this team,” Kinziger said. “No matter if the ball is going in or not, I’m just trying to do that to the best of my ability.”\n\nISU center Chase Walker scored 11 points and played only six minutes of action. Redbird coach Ryan Pedon said Walker suffered a hamstring injury in the first half.\n\nEven without Walker’s presence, ISU outscored Valpo, 42-24, in the paint.\n\n“I thought every guy that contributed tonight really played a very important role, and I think this was a very important victory for us tonight,” Pedon said.\n\nThe Redbirds play at UIC on Sunday.",

In his younger years, he was always setting records for being the youngest player to do something.\n\nNow that he is 23 years into his NBA career, he is setting records for being the oldest player to do something. On Thursday, James had a triple-double for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Dallas Mavericks, marking another record for the 41-year-old.\n\nNow that he is 41 years old, LeBron continues to be one of the most impressive athletes out there. Most NBA players have retired by this point, but he is still going strong for the Lakers.\n\nHe is not only playing, but he is playing well on a good team. That is just a testament to how well James has taken care of his body over the years, and his natural talent being higher than almost everyone else.\n\nMORE: Lakers' LeBron James ends NBA record streak that is unlikely to be matched any time soon\n\nAgainst the Mavericks, James had a triple-double with his 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 12 assists. He almost did not get his 10th rebound because Austin Reaves was fighting him for boards.\n\nHead coach JJ Redick was pleased to see James get another achievement, as he is always proud to be his head coach at the tail-end of his career.\n\n\"I don't take for granted how good he is. I recognize that on a daily basis. The more remarkable thing is how much he cares in his 23rd year with all his accomplishments. He's got a 23-year prime basically,\" Redick said after the win against Dallas.\n\nNow, James is the oldest player to get a triple-double at 41. That is possibly one of the toughest records to ever beat because most players struggle to perform in their mid-30s.\n\nHowever, LeBron continues to stand out even if he is in his record-setting 23rd season. James seems ready to play more seasons, which is proof of his all-time greatness.\n\nHow Olympics allowed Lakers to load manage injuries for LeBron James, Luka Doncic, Austin Reaves, Marcus Smart\n\nHow were Shaq, Duncan, Hakeem different as leaders?

    "fullText": "AFC Champions League Match Day 7 proved to be one of disappointment for K League's continental contingent. No wins, two draws and two losses across the two competitions leave work to be done for FC Seoul, Gangwon FC and Ulsan HD to reach the ACLE knockouts, while Pohang Steelers will have to earn a win in Japan to reach the ACL Two quarterfinals.\n\nIt proved to be a disappointing start to 2026 forFC Seoul, losing 2-0 to Vissel Kobe in Japan on Tuesday. There were debuts for six players: Gu Sung-yun in goal, Juan Antonio Ros at centre back, Hrvoje Babec and Song Jeong-beom in central midfield, Song Min-kyu at left wing, and Leonardo Ruiz in attack, but the capital club suffered the same fortunes from the tail-end of 2025.\n\nKobe controlled possession, limiting Seoul to just two shots on target. A scoreline of 0-0 at half time will have given Kim Gi-dong and his men some satisfaction, but goals from Muto Yoshinori and Sakai Gotoku in the space of four minutes, striking on 69 and 73 minutes respectively, dealt two hammer blows that Seoul couldn't recover from.\n\nK League's capital club have their knockout qualification destiny in their own hands, sitting sixth but with just a one-point lead. They face Sanfrecce Hiroshima next - at Mokdong and not Sangam - in their final league phase match. Sanfrecce will head to Korea on the back of back-to-back wins and a run of four unbeaten in ACL.\n\nGangwon FC's 0-0 draw with Chinese Super League champions Shanghai Port on Wednesday, on paper, represents a good result, but a single point earned, and now no wins in four, leaves the Bears clinging on to the last qualification place.\n\nGoh Young-jun made his Bears bow as a starter, while Israeli striker Abdalla Halaihal came off the bench as a late sub, replacing Goh, but it was a game where Gangwon just couldn't find a breakthrough.\n\nGangwon had 62% possession, 11 shots but just two found the target, while Shanghai Port managed just two shots and neither hit the target. Jeong Kyung-ho's men sit eighth on eight points and will need to go to Melbourne and beat City to guarantee a place in the knockouts.\n\nUlsan HD began the Kim Hyun-seok era with a 2-1 loss at home to Melbourne City. The result will have been a tough one to take, owing to a late, late Melbourne winner with Marcus Younis finding the back of the net in the 93rd minute.\n\nDarijan Bojanic equalised for the Horangi on 80 minutes, cancelling out Max Caputo's 37th-minute opener, but despite having thetiger's share of possession with 60% and 10 shots, it was a second ACLE loss in succession for Ulsan.\n\nUlsan sit one place outside the knockout qualification group, but level on points with Gangwon and Johor Darul Ta'zim. They face Shanghai Port next away from home, needing to win to advance.\n\nPohang Steelers came from behind to earn an ACL Two Round of 16 draw at home to Gamba Osaka. Yamashita Ryoya gave the J.League outfit the lead just after the restart, but Jorge Teixeira was able to offer a reply on 71 minutes. Nishiya Kento was the only Steelers debutant, starting in central midfield in a 4-1-4-1.\n\nPohang had to cede possession for the most part, but were able to out-edge Gamba in terms of shots and shots on target (14-12, 4-3). The result leaves the tie delicately poised ahead of next week's second leg in Osaka.",

    "fullText": "A player who many will know little about, Teddy Sharman-Lowe, could be in line for a shock start for Chelsea this evening.\n\nI think it will be a stretch to see him start to be honest, but manager Liam Rosenior has been dropping some hints suggesting that we could see the backup goalkeeper get some game time.\n\nChelsea’s usual number two stopper, Filip Jorgensen, is apparently injured right now. So that means number one keeper, Robert Sanchez, is currently playing every game. I know goalkeepers don’t need to rest as much as outfield players do because they run much more. But there is the element of a mental rest being needed too.\n\nAnd maybe Chelsea’s FA Cup tie against Hull City tonight might be where Rosenior decides he can rest Sanchez, even if that would be a huge and risky call and certainly a shock one.\n\nTeddy Sharman-Lowe playing for Doncaster. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nSharman-Lowe, who was recalled early from a season long loan move with Bolton Wanderers, is ready to be called on.\n\nIn words cited on X, Rosenior said:\n\n“Filip [Jorgensen] is not fully fit at the moment. He’s working really, really hard on his rehab. Teddy [Sharman-Lowe] has had a really important loan at this stage of his career. He’s been showing really good things in training as well, so I’ve got no worries if we have to call upon him.”\n\nJamie Carragher does not rate Chelsea’s summer signing of Liam Delap and believes the striker should have gone to a lesser club before he moved to a big club like Chelsea, making the switch from Ipswich Town.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelsea are considering offering a contract to Bournemouth centre back Marcos Senesi if/when he becomes a free agent at the end of this season.",

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — Playoff season is on the horizon for the Wall Hawks and Lady Hawks.\n\nThe Wall Hawks and Lady Hawks have soared over district opponents all season long. Both teams are district champions, and the Hawks look to match the Lady Hawks’ perfect 12-0 record.\n\nWith two regular season games remaining, the No. 15 Hawks have aspirations of completing an undefeated district record. Head coach Parker Roberts’ squad stands tall at 10-0, set to face current second-place holder Jim Ned Friday night. Wall narrowly held off Jim Ned 50-44 on Jan 20, as the Hawks go for the season sweep. Although Wall has already secured its District 6-3A Region I title, the goal hasn’t changed. The coaches’ and players’ mindset simply revolves around focusing on one game at a time.\n\n“The biggest thing for [Wall] is just trying to focus on one game at a time,” Roberts said. “Being this close and us already knowing that we’re the one seed, we try not to look to far ahead to the playoffs already. [We must] take care of the two games that we have left and keep that mindset one game at a time, because when you get to the playoffs it’s one game at a time.”\n\nOn the Lady Hawks’ side, head coach Silas Crisler’s team begins gearing up for its upcoming postseason run. No. 1 Wall faces Brady in the bi-district round at Winters High School on Monday, Feb 16. In Crisler’s vision, toughness is what makes the Lady Hawks the team to beat.\n\n“I have told our girls and they believe it that we are the toughest team in Texas,” Crisler said. “We say that with pride and we live it out every day. We’re going to continue that every single playoff game.”\n\nIn the players’ vision, team chemistry and depth define the group’s identity.\n\n“We not only have a starting five, we have a great five coming off the bench,” senior point guard Kathrine Lewis said. “We’re very versatile. If somebody tries to shut someone down, we have another girl coming in to take her spot. No one’s better than each other. We all have our own strengths that all go into the team and help us pull out wins.”",

    "description": "“The idea that the Northern Ireland international has suddenly become a weak link just doesn’t stack up”.",
    "fullText": "It’s a familiar movie, with the same script, a different director and different subject matter, yet the same core theme — a Sunderland player becoming a lightning rod for the team’s failure to perform on any given day.\n\nFor years, the starring role was played by Luke O’Nien, ludicriously branded a “liability” (a word I’d gladly see cast out of all Sunderland-related discourse — there are no liabilities in this team) and viewed in some circles as a weak link and someone who couldn’t trap a football, let alone play a key role in our eventual rise to the Premier League.\n\nIt was untrue then; it’s still untrue now, and although we might’ve hoped that singling out certain players for often disproportionate criticism is a habit we’d try to break, it’s nonetheless disheartening that as Sunderland’s form has hit choppier waters, a wholehearted, committed and high-quality footballer in Trai Hume has found himself under the microscope.\n\nLet’s nail something down: pound for pound, Hume is one of the best, most effective and successful signings made by Sunderland during Kristjaan Speakman’s time at the club.\n\nWhen he arrived from Linfield in 2022, he had the feel of a low-risk, “one for the future”-type signing but during four years in red and white, his ferocious will to win and refusal to take a backwards step have been a key component of Sunderland’s rise from League One to the Premier League.\n\nHe’s also far more technically accomplished than we often highlight and his low-key attitude is a perfect fit for the times: no nonsense and no razzle-dazzle — just a rugged approach to the game that Régis Le Bris and his teammates clearly appreciate.\n\nWhy, therefore, has Hume suddenly become such a polarising figure among pockets of the fanbase?\n\nYes, recent results have been average and our performance levels aren’t currently hitting the heights that they did earlier in the campaign, but as Le Bris is often at pains to point out, collectivism is the name of the game at the Stadium of Light and it was good to hear him offer some staunch backing for Hume earlier this week.\n\nOK, the absence of Bertrand Traoré and the spectre of Lutsharel Geertruida (a superb and extremely versatile player in his own right) may be factors here, but the idea that the Northern Ireland international has suddenly become a weak link just doesn’t stack up.\n\nPerhaps Le Bris is asking Hume — a hard-tackling right back by trade — to push his versatility a shade too far at times, but that’s not on Hume himself and after a challenging afternoon against West Ham, has he not handled himself well as captain during the subsequent clashes with Burnley, Arsenal and Liverpool on Wednesday night?\n\nLet’s be frank: Granit Xhaka’s absence has forced the head coach to adapt and the results have been mixed, but hanging a player out to dry because he’s perhaps not living up to your expectations in a role he’s still learning is hardly sound reasoning.\n\nCollectively, Sunderland weren’t anywhere near their best against Liverpool.\n\nOn reflection, it seemed as though we showed the visitors too much respect, and there was a timidity to our play that I found slightly puzzling at times, with safe passes being chosen too often for my liking and Alisson not really being troubled for the majority of the game.\n\nThis isn’t entirely attributable to Hume, however, and if we’re going to analyse where things aren’t quite clicking for Sunderland, it’s grossly unfair to turn on a player who’s demonstrated throughout the season that he does have Premier League quality and for whom the step up from the Championship has not proven impossible to make.\n\nHe’s doing what’s being asked of him; he’s doing it to the best of his ability and if Le Bris opts to bring Geertruida into the fold for Sunday’s FA Cup tie at Oxford or next Sunday’s league meeting with Fulham, I’m sure Hume, as a double promotion winner and one of our longest-serving players, will respond as professionally as possible.\n\nOn a final note, it should be highlighted that legitimate and constructive criticism of players’ performances is fine.\n\nThat’s part of the deal, but I really do wish we’d take a moment before tossing words such as ‘liability” around so flippantly and laying into players with unnecessary venom. It adds nothing the discussion and potentially does more harm than good — not least given the scrutiny these lads are already under as they compete in such a tough and demanding league.",

    "fullText": "Suffering back-to-back league defeats and losing our impervious home record were tough blows to take but losing to one of the best teams in the world — and the reigning league champions at that — is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nOxford provides a good opportunity to get back on track, but I know they won’t make it easy for us. They’re struggling in the league and without a win in four games, so they might see the FA Cup as a good opportunity to lift the fans and instil some hope for the rest of the season.\n\nWith this in mind, I think Régis Le Bris will field as strong a team as possible this weekend.\n\nIn the last round against Everton, I thought we would rotate and focus more on the league, but I was proved wrong and a strong eleven helped us progress into the next round. Of course, Everton are a much better side than Oxford but Le Bris seems interested in the FA Cup and its possibilities, so I wouldn’t be too surprised if we did see a good team take to the field this weekend.\n\nHowever, the Lads have had a tough and demanding week. Games against Arsenal and Liverpool would’ve taken a lot out of them and that may force Le Bris’ hand in terms of rotating the squad.\n\nI remember in the run-up to the Everton game, he said that he would speak to each player and see if they were up to it — and I presume he will have followed the same procedure this week. I wonder whether Melker Ellborg will get his first start in goal on Sunday, and maybe Jocelin Ta Bi will be in the squad for the first time since his arrival.\n\nI’d like to see the best side available to us play this weekend, but whether that’ll happen is a different story. By 1:00pm on Sunday, our questions will be answered and an idea of our chances in this competition may be clearer.\n\nLosing twice on the bounce is an unusual feeling for Sunderland fans but it’s worth remembering that thanks to the quirks of the fixture computer, we’ve played last season’s champions and this season’s champions-elect — with a game against Manchester City thrown into the tough run of matches.\n\nThat being considered, it’s still been a very positive and uplifting season and for the first time a long while, the FA Cup offers us definite hope and possibilities.\n\nWe haven’t got the punishing, continuous run of midweek games that teams in the EFL or in Europe are dealing with.\n\nWe also aren’t in a relegation fight, so the FA Cup can be a positive distraction from our league matches. From all the interviews and messages coming out of the club, it sounds as though this is the case; in fact, Noah Sadiki actually said that the cup is “just as important as the league games”. Nice to hear.\n\nConsecutive defeats might’ve dented any European hopes that some of the more positive-minded fans might be hoping for (myself included), so the cup tie could be coming at exactly the right time to reignite the squad and fans, and to give us something to battle for on a different front.\n\nNo matter how proud we should be of a potential mid-table position come the end of the season, it nevertheless gives the players little incentive to pull out all the stops and do battle in every game — an FA Cup run can give us that.\n\nSo although I expect a few changes this weekend (some perhaps forced), I’m certain we’ll put out a strong team and take Oxford very seriously. Being in the hat for round five could start to awaken some imaginations!\n\nI’m looking forward to the game and I do hope we progress, as after a tough few Premier League games (with a good result against Burnley in the middle) we certainly need something to pick the Lads and the fans back up.\n\nI’m the sort of fan who appreciates that we’re likely to lose to Arsenal and Liverpool during our first season back at the top level and that taking points from these teams again this season always was a tough ask after doing well previously.\n\nThat’s especially true when such games are so close together and we’ve recently been without our skipper.\n\nDespite only taking two points from twelve available, these are established elite teams and that isn’t a bad haul for a team such as ourselves. I also get that defeat is a painful pill to swallow, amplified by Sunderland not playing as well as we know we can — although the Arsenal performance wasn’t bad at all, other than the score.\n\nOxford is a place many of us went to when we were back in the doldrums of League One, and I have fond memories of the away end limbs and Elliot Embleton scoring for us as we progressed the part of our journey.\n\nThe side we take to their weird, three-sided stadium will be very different from the eleven that faced Arsenal and Liverpool, but it’s a great chance for some of the fringe players to get some minutes and for more relationships to be matured and solidified.\n\nIt’s also a chance for some players to rest a little and to enjoy the thrill of the FA Cup from the bench if needed, whilst maybe recovering and getting ready for the next Premier League challenge to come.\n\nIn short, this is a fresh breath of air where we can rotate, still play some good football and hopefully progress to the next round without too much fuss and bother — ideally with zero injuries to our Premier League starters.\n\nOn the day, I’d like to see more of Lutsharel Geertruida, Wilson Isidor, Romaine Mundle, Eliezer Mayenda, Dennis Cirkin, Chris Rigg and maybe our new goalkeeper Melker Ellborg. Drop a smattering of the first eleven around that and we should have enough to prevail.\n\nWe’re pretty safe in the league, so let’s give this a go and put a smile back on all our faces before the league returns.",

    "fullText": "The Winter Olympics in Milan Cortina are underway and out of the thousands of Olympians, four come the state of Texas.\n\nRepresenting the Lone Star State are Amber Glenn from Plano and Emily Chan from Pasadena, men's bobsledder Boone Niederhofer from San Antonio and women's hockey forward Hannah Bilka from Coppell.\n\nAs of Friday, some of these athletes have yet to compete, so there's still plenty of chances to cheer on the Texans in their pursuit of gold. The 2026 Olympic Games don't end until Feb. 22.\n\nMORE: After 'scary amount' of threats, Texas Olympics figure skater steps back from social media\n\nMORE:  Which state dominates the Olympics — and how does Texas compare?\n\nHere is a schedule for the Texas Olympians:\n\nGlenn already won gold as a member of Team USA's figure skating team event; it's the second straight gold for the U.S. in the event. After finishing Glenn third during her skate in the team event, she still has to the chance for an individual medal.\n\nShe will take the ice at 11:45 a.m. Tuesday at Milano Ice Skating Arena for her short program and at noon Thursday for her free skate.\n\nChan has a chance to add an Olympic medal to her the silvers she's earned in other competitions while competing for Texas USA.\n\nShe and skating partner Spencer Howe compete at 12:45 p.m. Sunday at Milano Ice Skating Arena in the short program and 1 p.m. Monday is their free skate.\n\nThe differences between a short program and a free skate are timing and what is being showcased on the ice, according to the NBC Olympics website. A short program is a technical routine no more than 2 minutes, 40 seconds while a free skate lasts four minutes that can showcase the athlete's artistry.\n\nNiederhofer, a former Texas A&M football walk-on will be a member of the four-man team. Two-man runs will continue Feb. 16-17 for the men with the medal run happening at 11:35 p.m. The four-man run finals begin Sunday morning, Feb. 22.\n\nTeam USA has been dominating the competition with Bilka leading the way. The Coppell native scored two goals in the 5-0 rout of rival Canada ; she has three goals in Olympic competition.\n\nSince going undefeated in the preliminary round, the U.S. is preparing for a Friday game against Italy. If the U.S. wins, the semifinal game will be Monday with the date of the gold medal game to be determined.",

    "fullText": "Losing away at Arsenal (the soon-to-be Premier League champions) and then at home against Liverpool (the reigning trophy-holders) is not the disaster that some social media dwellers would have you believing if you took their words with anything more than a shovelful of salt.\n\nYes, it’s perfectly understandable that Sunderland would drop points against such weighty opponents, yet rather predictably, the inquest started during and after Wednesday’s defeat at the hands of Arne Slot’s side.\n\nI won’t even repeat some of the things that I saw myself, but I’m sure you, reading this, will have also seen criticism of certain players layered in hyperbole and drama.\n\nIt’s seemingly in the eyes of some people no longer acceptable to have the odd off day, or for players to go through periods of struggle. Instead, they’re just labelled as shite, treated like morons, and talked about like they’re carrying a serious contagious disease, as though we really ought not to be associated with them.\n\nMost irritatingly for me, anyway, this stuff is levelled at lads who played for us in the Championship, and we owe a great amount of gratitude to them for even being in a position where we can lose to a team like Liverpool in a league game. They’re also young, which adds extra layers of complexity, as we know for a fact that young players read and see the words written about them online.\n\nAm I saying you mustn’t criticise players if they haven’t played well? Absolutely not. They’re in a position where they are being judged constantly, so it’s only natural that we would.\n\nBut, whatever happened to just being sensible and rational? Some of them are only playing such a significant role, or in unfamiliar positions, because more senior and capable players aren’t available right now.\n\nTo a lesser degree, I think it’s fair to say that it’s been tough replacing the experience and creativity of Bertrand Traoré on our right-hand side, and once he does return it will be a welcome one, but I think we have enough about us in the squad to cope with not having him for what will eventually be just over two months, factoring in the time he was away at AFCON and then through injury since returning.\n\nThe far more difficult and, dare I say, impossible task is to replace Granit Xhaka. We have many great players, and I really think the future is bright when I watch Sunderland’s midfielders strut their stuff, but there really isn’t another player out there that’s attainable that could do what Granit Xhaka does for this team.\n\nHis leadership qualities alone are simply irreplaceable. He directs traffic, he demands that everyone meet the standards that he does, and he strikes fear into our opponents. Players and coaches know that when they’re facing a midfield that can call upon the skillset of Granit Xhaka, they’re in for an infinitely tougher afternoon than they would be against most other teams in the division. Then there’s what he brings on the pitch from a playing standpoint — he’s our greatest creative source, is a world-class passer of the ball, and dictates the tempo of games. These are skills that he’s honed over many years; skills you simply wouldn’t expect from your average 21-year-old just making their first big strides onto the world’s stage.\n\nAll of that said, it amazes me that people are scrabbling around looking to find difficult answers to what are simple questions. The noticeable drop-off in Sunderland’s performances recently, Burnley aside, can mostly be put down to the fact that we’re missing our best player.\n\nThe reason the manager continues to play Trai Hume out of position is that without Granit, we lack leadership, defensive cover, and bite in midfield, which is a quality that Trai provides.\n\nIs it really that difficult to understand, or am I oversimplifying things? That doesn’t exempt Régis from criticism when he gets some of his decisions wrong, but given the fact that he got us promoted and then we’ve had such an unbelievable season, he’s built up a significant amount of credit and respect, and that should make people think more than twice about questioning his decision-making.\n\nIt’s probably difficult to do this when the games are coming thick and fast, but I really wish that people who get aggravated regardless of who we lose to — whether that be one of the best teams walking the planet, or a team fighting for their survival — would just take a breath, have a think, and put their phones down before they tweet something silly. It doesn’t help anyone, really.\n\nWe’ve already far exceeded my expectations for the season, and with survival virtually guaranteed, anything else we do from this point is a bonus. We’ll probably lose a good few more games this season, but we’ll also win games, and hopefully we can get that winning feeling back again, starting on Sunday at Oxford.\n\nIn Régis I trust… and hopefully you do, too.",

    "fullText": "A.J. Brown trade rumors: Steelers, Patriots among 5 best fits, likely landing spots for Eagles WR originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles need to decide soon on whether they want to keep wide receiver A.J. Brown as part of their offensive plans for 2026. The mercurial playmaker is among the top candidates to get traded in a blockbuster deal in the NFL offseason.\n\nAlthough the team hired a new offensive coordinator, Sean Mannion, to help them restore a top down field passing game with Jalen Hurts, they can still consider moving Brown should the right offer come along.\n\nHere's looking at the teams to watch most for landing Brown:\n\nMORE: Ranking the top 100 free agents in 2026 NFL offseason\n\nBrown reuniting with former Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore makes a lot of sense. The Saints need to hack away with their latest salary cap issues, but they should be interested in making room for Brown as the ideal big-play No. 1 for strong-armed second-year QB Tyler Shough. Brown and Chris Olave would be a tough 1-2 punch in the passing game, resetting New Orleans' offensive ceiling.\n\nThe Saints could use the No. 8 overall pick to trade for Brown if needed and if not, they can offer a package that includes No. 42 overall in the second round. This would be a big, immediate impact move for the Saints to improve with no transition needed for Brown.\n\nThe Raiders need to work on their offensive line most for presumed No. 1 overall pick, rookie starting QB Fernando Mendoza. They already have a couple of top-flight first-round playmakers in running back Asthon Jeanty and tight end Brock Bowers. The missing piece is a go-to wide receiver as they have parted ways with Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers in the middle of the past two seasons. Giving Mendoza a weapon of Brown's caliber to stretch the field would better open up the rushing attack for Jeanty and the intermediate passing routes for Bowers.\n\nThe Raiders have a ton of money under the cap to lock up Brown with a contract extension and should be able to be make it work to acquire him in a package that involves their second-round pick (No. 36 overall).\n\nThe 49ers are blowing up their receiving corps with Brandon Aiyuk set to be dealt and Jauan Jennings primed to depart in free agency. They also don't know when tight end George Kittle can get to full speed from his late Achilles' injury. Brock Purdy is in a tough spot with his weapons beyond Christian McCaffrey and third-year first-rounder Ricky Perasall. If Philadelphia could work a trade with a fellow NFC playoff team, then this would make sense.\n\nBrown would take over as the Niners' top wideout and mesh well with Purdy's deep passing accuracy. San Francisco can offer the No. 27 overall pick in the first round for Brown and it can also make it work salary-wise, already being more than $40 million under the cap.\n\nMORE: Sporting News' latest mock draft with order finalized\n\nThe Patriots improved by 10 games and got to Super Bowl 60 in part because they were rather aggressive in spending in free agency at the right spots, including signing former Eagles' defensive tackle Milton Williams. Now they should be looking at Philadelphia again to give Drake Maye, another accurate downfield passer, a true big-play No. 1 to help upgrade from the mix of Stefon Diggs, Kayshon Boutte and Mack Hollins.\n\nNew England should be OK parting ways with the No. 31 overall pick in the first round as part of the Eagles' compensation. The Patriots can also provide a solid former Titans reunion between Brown and coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nThe Steelers would be the dark horse of the group, but there's some appeal to having Brown reunite with former Ole Miss teammate DK Metcalf and give Aaron Rodgers a pair of dangerous downfield targets. Brown can take over as a more reliable No. 1 and set up Metcalf to operate better as a No. 2 with more favorable coverage outside and inside.\n\nPittsburgh can be the most aggressive and offer the No. 21 overall pick in a deal to land Brown. The team can also splurge a little, being around $45 million under the salary cap.",

    "description": "On Thursday, the NBA announced just 30 minutes before the Utah Jazz’s home game against the Portland Trail Blazers that it was fining the Jazz $500,000 for “conduct detrimental to the league.”  The statement specifically noted games against the Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat in which Utah sat Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr. in the fourth quarters.  The Jazz lost to Orlando, but beat Miami.",
    "fullText": "On Thursday, the NBA announced just 30 minutes before the Utah Jazz’s home game against the Portland Trail Blazers that it was fining the Jazz $500,000 for “conduct detrimental to the league.”\n\nThe statement specifically noted games against the Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat in which Utah sat Lauri Markkanen and Jaren Jackson Jr. in the fourth quarters. The Jazz lost to Orlando, but beat Miami.\n\nThe NBA implemented the Player Participation Policy at the start of the 2023-24 season. The policy lays out rules for teams regarding participation of the league’s star players, which is defined as any player named to an All-NBA team or named an NBA All-Star in any of the previous three seasons.\n\nMarkkanen and Jackson are the only players on the Jazz for whom that definition applies to.\n\nOne rule in the policy states, “Teams must refrain from any long-term shutdown (or near shutdown) whereby a star player ceases participating in games or begins to play a materially reduced role in circumstances affecting the integrity of the game.”\n\nThe Jazz won’t have to worry about Jackson’s minutes moving forward this season, as the team announced Thursday that he will likely be out for the remainder of the season due to a knee surgery to remove a benign tumor.\n\nUtah head coach Will Hardy said he sat Markkanen against the Magic and Heat because Markkanen was on a minutes restriction, and Hardy said he’d continue to do so if instructed by the medical team.\n\n“So if our medical team puts a minutes restriction on Lauri, I’ll try to keep Lauri healthy,” Hardy said.\n\nThe Jazz were again without any of their star players in Thursday’s 135-119 loss to the Trail Blazers, as Keyonte George also continued to sit out due to an ankle sprain he sustained against the Magic.\n\nPortland was without All-Star Deni Avdija.\n\nThe Jazz played tight and went into halftime with a 63-61 lead but fell apart in the third quarter as it’s done numerous times this year.\n\nThe Trail Blazers outscored Utah 40-23 in the third.\n\n“The game got away from us in the third quarter, mostly because of fouling,” Hardy said. “They shot 16 free throws in the quarter. When that happens, it’s also hard to get into a rhythm offensively because you’re playing against a set defense for most of the time.”\n\nUtah did see some life in the fourth, especially from Svi Mykhailiuk. The veteran was out of the rotation for three straight games but came into Thursday’s contest and scored 14 points in just 17 minutes.\n\nHe shot 4 of 5 from behind the 3-point line and the Jazz opened the quarter outscoring Portland 22-10.\n\n“Svi’s been the ultimate pro his entire time with us,” Hardy said. “There are times that he’s in the rotation, there’s times he’s been a starter, there’s times he’s been out of the rotation and he always handles himself with a ton of class.”\n\nDespite the Jazz clawing back from a 15-point deficit, Portland ran away with it.\n\nBrice Sensabaugh led the Jazz with 28 points, while Kyle Filipowski, Isaiah Collier and Ace Bailey all added 15 points.\n\nUtah’s new two-way player, Blake Hinson, also saw his first minutes in Thursday’s loss and scored 11 points on 4 of 7 shooting in his debut.",

    "fullText": "Kieffer Moore and Nathan Broadhead played key roles in Ipswich Town's rise up the football pyramid.\n\nBut the Welsh duo are now plotting the Tractor Boys' downfall as they bid to fire Wrexham into the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 1996-97 by beating their former employers.\n\n\"I can't wait to see many close friends of mine that I spent two-and-a-half years with, I'm looking forward to seeing them, and hopefully we can beat them,\" Broadhead told BBC Radio Wales Sport.\n\nWhile also showing sentiment towards those at Portman Road, forward Moore was equally ruthless.\n\n\"I love playing against my old sides and I love scoring against them too,\" he told BBC Match of the Day Wales.\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\nMoore targeting Wrexham and Wales double\n\nAfter joining Ipswich from Everton in January 2023, Broadhead netted eight goals in 19 league appearances to help fire the Tractor Boys to promotion from League One.\n\nHe scored 13 league goals in the 2023-24 campaign as Kieran McKenna's side gained promotion into the Premier League, ending the club's 22-year absence from the top-flight.\n\n\"They were in League One at the time and my ambition was to play in the Premier League with that club, and we did it,\" said Broadhead.\n\n\"It was really good for me and my career so I'm just thankful for that.\n\n\"We had the same team, near enough, from League One and everyone knew how each other played. It was a crazy few years, some of the best of my career to be fair.\"\n\nMoore - who was also with Ipswich in 2017-18 - spent the latter half of the 2023-24 season alongside Broadhead at Portman Road, scoring seven goals as they clinched promotion to the top-flight.\n\n\"I can only speak highly about that club. Everything around that club is amazing,\" Moore said of Ipswich.\n\n\"I have very fond memories of the place, of course. Getting promoted to the Premier League was incredible. I'll look forward to seeing some of the guys.\"\n\nNow bidding to haunt his former employers, Broadhead hopes to emulate his Ipswich success by guiding Wrexham into the Premier League.\n\nPhil Parkinson's men sit sixth in the Championship, and having already beaten Premier League Nottingham Forest in this year's FA Cup, and Broadhead is hoping for more nights to remember in north Wales.\n\n\"It (Forest win) was some feeling. It just shows where we're at as a team, competing with teams and players like that,\" he explained.\n\nJust eight days after their cup tussle, Wrexham and Ipswich meet again in the Championship, so there will be ample opportunity for Broadhead and Moore to become reacquainted with their former team-mates.\n\nBut the bigger picture always circles back to the main goal. A fourth consecutive Wrexham promotion.\n\n\"We're in a good position at the moment but there's a long way to go. The last 15 games are massive,\" said Broadhead.\n\nListen to Wrexham interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds\n\nFive years of Hollywood - Wrexham's transformation",

    "fullText": "Golden State Warriors’ loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday would sting heavily, considering they were 16 points up in the third quarter. But their effort cannot be undermined either, with Draymond Green in particular, doing his absolute level best to contain Victor Wembanyama in the game. The way the game was called, however, left the Warriors legend disappointed.\n\nGreen scored 17 points on the night, and his defense on Wembanyama limited him to 26. It was enough for the Spurs, but in the roughly the first half of the game, life was made difficult for the Frenchman. Amidst their physical tussle, though, Wembanyamatoo tried to stop Green by going that extra leg, and at one point, had his arms wrapped completely around him.\n\nA fan pointed this out on social media platform threads, and called Doris Burke, who was commentator for the game, out. Green responded and didn’t hold back on his thoughts on her.\n\n“She will always ignore things happening to me and only half mention the good. And take shots when they are available. Been that way for a while,” Green replied.\n\nGreen has many enemies in the league. Most of them are players who’ve seen his ugly side when he resorts to fights on the court or reacts violently to relatively small incidents. Ask Rudy Gobert and Josef Nurkic. They may not admit it, but they would genuinely avoid altercations with Green.\n\nThis has not helped Green’s reputation among journalists and broadcasters. His ability is not in doubt, and people know how great a defender he can be. However, a chokehold on a multiple-time Defensive Player of the Year is something that becomes difficult to forget.\n\nThat said, commentary should not be biased either. Green has a right to be upset about the fact that Burke rarely says positive things about him, even when he is actually playing well. For instance, against the Spurs on Wednesday, it was one of his better nights of the 2025-26 season.\n\nA small acknowledgment of that would not have hurt and may have prevented this online dig at Burke.\n\nThe post Draymond Green Slams Doris Burke Over Biased Reporting, Using Broadcasts to “Take Shots” at Him appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Blue Jays predicted to sign Phillies' $20M reject, Silver Slugger winner after losing Kyle Tucker originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays got off to a strong start this offseason, but ultimately missed out on several remaining big-name targets. Their biggest miss came when Kyle Tucker signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n“Kyle Tucker, the consensus best player available in free agency, agreed to join the Dodgers on Thursday, sources told ESPN, a little more than a month after star closer Edwin Diaz did the same. Tucker's deal is for four years at $240 million and includes opt-outs after the second and third seasons, sources told ESPN's Jeff Passan and Jesse Rogers,” ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez wrote.\n\nThe Blue Jays can still make a late addition, and one name to watch is Nick Castellanos. FanSided’s Mark Powell believes Castellanos will sign with Toronto after being released on Thursday.\n\n“Of those teams, I'd consider the Blue Jays favorites due to need alone. Toronto lost outfielder Anthony Santander to injury, as he's expected to miss 5-6 months after undergoing shoulder surgery,” Powell wrote.\n\nWhile Castellanos isn’t the same type of player Tucker is, he would give Toronto a veteran option in right field. Castellanos was released by the Philadelphia Phillies on Thursday and will still be owed the remainder of his contract from Philadelphia.\n\n“The Philadelphia Phillies released outfielder Nick Castellanos on Thursday after the team was unable to make a deal to trade him. Castellanos then revealed he was benched last season after bringing beer into the dugout during a game. The team wanted the situation resolved before its first full-squad workout at spring training, which is Monday,” ESPN wrote.\n\nCastellanos would provide a powerful right-handed bat, though he won’t be as reliable defensively, as he is considered one of the weaker defenders in the game. Still, his offensive upside makes him an intriguing option for the Blue Jays.\n\nToronto is looking to add a veteran presence, and Castellanos brings that along with World Series experience — exactly what the organization is hoping to recapture. A move like this could provide meaningful support to Toronto’s lineup.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCanada couldn't have started the Olympics any better, as the men's hockey favorites blew out Czechia in a 5-0 opening victory.\n\nThe Canadian team had five different players score on Thursday, including Macklin Celebrini and Nathan MacKinnon, in its first Olympic game with NHL players since 2014. As Czechia is Canada's biggest competition in Group A, that performance was bad news for the rest of the group.\n\nHowever, Switzerland also began the Olympics strong with a 4-0 win over France itself, putting the team in position for a potential underdog run. Timo Meier scored twice for the Swiss in that game, while goalie Leonardo Genoni produced a 27-save shutout.\n\nHere's how viewers can watch Canada play Switzerland in the Olympic men's hockey preliminary rounds.\n\nFriday's Canada-Switzerland game won't be broadcast on traditional television but it can be streamed via Peacock, which will carry every event of the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics live.\n\nThe NBC-owned streaming service's sports programming features live coverage of NFL Sunday Night Football, the NBA, the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Premier League soccer, Big Ten football and basketball, Notre Dame football, Big East and Big 12 basketball, PGA Tour golf, and more.\n\nCanada and Switzerland will close out the hockey schedule on Friday with a game at 3:10 p.m. ET.

    "fullText": "After back-to-back away trips to Burton and Rotherham, League One title hopefuls Cardiff return to Cardiff City Stadium this weekend.\n\nAnd when it comes to playing in south Wales, head coach Brian Barry-Murphy and his captain Calum Chambers are clearly of the same opinion.\n\n\"We love playing at home. Our home record's been phenomenal this season, and the pitch is in fantastic condition,\" said Barry-Murphy.\n\n\"We look forward to it immensely and try to give the supporters what they crave on Saturday.\"\n\nCardiff were ruthless in their last home outing, a 4–0 demolition of Barnsley, and when they welcome play-off chasing Luton on Saturday, 14 February (1500 GMT), Barry-Murphy will hope for another dominant display.\n\nThe Bluebirds have lost only twice at home this season, a record defender Chambers believes is powered by the supporters.\n\n\"They're amazing. They really help us in games,\" said the former Arsenal and Aston Villa man.\n\n\"You really do feel the energy they give us, especially at key moments when we need a goal. We love playing at home.\"\n\nThe League One leaders will need that energy against a Luton side riding high after a 2-1 victory over Bradford which bolstered their own hopes of achieving promotion.\n\nCardiff, meanwhile, are pushing to maintain momentum in their push for an immediate return to the Championship.\n\nChambers, who joined the Welsh side last season, described Cardiff's Championship campaign as \"tough,\" but says relegation has brought players and fans together again.\n\n\"The atmosphere is class, really good here. Compared to last year, this season has been bouncing.\"\n\nBarry-Murphy, who only arrived in June, has also felt that strong connection since his arrival.\n\n\"The support from the supporters to our players has always been there,\" he said.\n\n\"Our intention is to give them more of the best of ourselves so they don't have to go through the worst of it.\"\n\nFor the visit of The Hatters, Wales international Dylan Lawlor returns to the squad.\n\nThe 20-year-old has been part of the back line responsible for nine of Cardiff's 12 clean sheets this season - the best defensive record in the division.\n\nBut Barry-Murphy will be without forward Isaak Davies who suffered a concussion following an unnoticed blow to the head in the 86th minute against Rotherham.\n\nCardiff also remain without top scorer Yousef Salech and influential midfielder Rubin Colwill, both key to the club's early-season success.\n\nColwill is now back in training and Salech is making \"good progress\" after seeing a specialist, but the manager urged patience.\n\n\"Rubin's back in full training but he's been out for a long time, so it's about balancing when he's actually available to get back on the bench,\" said Barry-Murphy.\n\n\"Yousef's continuing his rehabilitation, so he won't be available.\"",

    "fullText": "Manchester United Women faced Atletico Madrid in their first ever Champions League knockout match.\n\nThe Red Devils got off to the perfect start when Melvine Malard intercepted the ball and played it forward to Elisabeth Terland.\n\nThe Norwegian beat a couple of defenders and fired an unstoppable left-footed drive into the corner of the net, giving Marc Skinner’s side the perfect start. Five minutes later, Terland thought she had doubled her tally after producing a fine volley into the roof of the net from an Ellen Wangerheim knock-down, but VAR promptly ruled out the strike.\n\nUnited continued to press the Atletico defence effectively and profited again just before half-time.\n\nHinata Miyazawa won the ball around the halfway line and drove at the Spanish defence.\n\nShe played through Malard, who cut inside and unleashed a lovely curling effort that nestled into the far corner. It was 2-0 to United and they were well in the box seat of this tie.\n\nJayde Riviere burst down the right-hand side and continued to run at the Atletico defence.\n\nNobody stopped the Canadian and she shot at goal from close range, but her effort was well stopped by the hosts’ keeper.\n\nFormer United star Vilde Bøe Risa had a free-kick for the home side, but her effort was expertly tipped onto the crossbar by Phallon Tullis-Joyce.\n\nAtletico continued to pile on the pressure, but Maya Le Tissier had other ideas.\n\nShe pulled off two successive blocks to stop what looked like a certain goal and kept United’s two-goal lead intact.\n\nUnited weathered the storm and delivered what could be the killer blow in the last ten minutes of the match.\n\nGood football around the area resulted in Lisa Naalsund playing the ball to Malard, who released Julia Olme, who fired a left-footed effort into the goal to give United a 3-0 lead.\n\nUnited will be delighted with their performance and will now take a three-goal advantage back to Manchester, with one foot surely in the quarter-final stage of their debut Champions League campaign.\n\nFeatured image Ben Roberts Photo via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "A whole host of players have been linked with a Merseyside move in recent months but one of the most intriguing rumours centres around Sandro Tonali, who is reportedly seeking a move away from Newcastle.\n\nNews broke on deadline day of the winter window that the Italian had been offered to Arsenal by his agent, but subsequent reports have suggested the Reds have opened talks to bring him to Anfield.\n\nThe 25-year-old has featured in almost every game for Newcastle this season but only featured from the bench in the Magpies recent victory over Tottenham.\n\nHaving made 70 Premier League and 28 Champions League appearances in his career, Tonali represents a ready-made option for Liverpool, but a deal will be incredibly complicated.\n\nLast summer saw Alexander Isak swap St James’ Park for Anfield in a British record transfer, but the deal will no doubt have left a sour taste in the mouth of his former employer.\n\nThe Swede went on strike, refusing to play for Eddie Howe’s side to force through a transfer – a move that obviously ruffled some feathers.\n\nNow, less than a year later, Liverpool are back in for one of Newcastle’s best players and the Isak saga will still be fresh in everyone’s minds.\n\nThe Reds aren’t the only team interested in Tonali, so a transfer away from the North East feels likely, but if the Italian chooses Liverpool as his next destination, it may be difficult for Newcastle to stand in his way.",

But, the lines have been jumped over more often in recent years and I think Van Dijk is right about that.\n\n\"Because of the clickbait, it is so much easier to get more likes, views and work if you're a little bit more extreme. Ex-players aren't stupid and they know that. If you are too sensible and sit on the fence you won't get the big gigs.\n\n\"You have a dichotomy. Most ex-players would like to be balanced but they know if they are too balanced and sensible they won't be there next week.\n\n\"My criticism would always be constructive criticism which is explained. One-dimensional labeling of players should never happen. Sometimes if a big name says something enough it becomes accepted wisdom.\"\n\nVan der Kraan added: \"There are two different kinds of pundits; those who need to be on every week and those who are genuinely focused on what is right and what players should do.\n\n\"For Van Dijk, after so many years enough is enough.\n\n\"It all started after he came into the Netherlands team and became a big player at Liverpool. The first ex-player to really criticise him was Marco van Basten, saying he was not a leader.

    "title": "Winter Olympics 2026: Madison Chock and Evan Bates say scoring confusion does 'disservice' to figure skating",
    "description": "The judging of the free dance has come under heavy scrutiny in the U.S.",
    "fullText": "One of the biggest controversies of the 2026 Winter Olympics has been the scoring of the figure skating ice dance event, where French pair Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron defeated the heavy favorite, Team USA's Madison Chock and Evan Bates.\n\nThat hasn't been a popular result in the U.S., and Chock and Bates acknowledged the controversy on Thursday while speaking with USA Today. While they didn't go as far as some of their fans, they did acknowledge this episode hasn't been the best look for figure skating:\n\n“Any time the public is confused by results, it does a disservice to our sport,” Chock said on Thursday.\n\n“It's hard to retain fans when it's difficult to understand what is happening on the ice. I think there needs to be a lot more clarity for the skaters, for the coaches and for the audience, in order to just have a solid fan base moving forward. People need to understand what they're cheering for and be able to feel confident in the sport that they're supporting.”\n\nAt issue is a scoring system in which the majority of the judges favored the Americans, but gave the French the win.\n\nWhen reviewing the individual judges' scores in the free dance, the French judge sticks out with their compatriots' second highest score and the lowest score Chock and Bates received, with a delta of nearly eight points. By comparison, the American judge favored Chock and Bates by about four points.\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics figure skating ⛸️ free dance was scored by 9 judges\n\nThe French judge gave Beaudry & Cizeron 🇫🇷 a 137.45 but only gave Chock & Bates 🇺🇸 a 129.74\n\nAll other judges were relatively close in their two scores 🤔\n\nJudge No. 4 was just in a bad mood overall pic.twitter.com/1HkDHY5vuo\n\n— Lev Akabas (@LevAkabas) February 12, 2026\n\nBeaudry and Cizeron won by approximately a point and a half, despite some stumbles on the free dance some believed should have cost them enough points to land in silver territory. We're talking about the kind of a result that creates slow-motion supercuts on Reddit.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire is the fact Beaudry and Cizeron were already a controversial pair.\n\nAn online petition calling for an investigation has been circling among Chock/Bates fans, which Bates acknowledged but didn't explicitly endorse:\n\n“We haven’t actually seen it, we’ve just heard about it, but it means a lot that people are voicing their opinions on our behalf,” Bates said. “I think the way that we skated and the way we’ve approached chasing these goals hopefully has resonated with people at home, and even in our response I think hopefully that too can reflect the Olympic spirit.”\n\nThe International Skating Union has responded to the discourse as well, with a spokesperson issuing a statement to NBC News:\n\n\"It is normal for there to be a range of scores given by different judges in any panel and a number of mechanisms are used to mitigate these variations. The ISU has full confidence in the scores given and remains completely committed to fairness.\"\n\nTogether, Chock and Bates have won the last three ice dance world titles and hold a pair of Olympic gold medals as part of the U.S.' wins in the team event in 2022 and 2026. They have been skating together since 2011 and married in 2024.\n\nThey declined to tell USA Today if they would go for a fourth straight world title in March, but said they “have plans to remain on the ice” for now.",

    "description": "Booing at football is an accepted part of the game. It's been around since time began, but are fans increasingly booing their own team?",
    "fullText": "Booing at football is an accepted part of the game. It's been around since time began, as normal now as pre-match pints and half-time pies.\n\nFor players and match officials it is what they have come to expect at some point in their careers. But are fans booing their own team and manager more nowadays? And if so, why?\n\nThis season we've seen some high profile examples in the Premier League, most notably with Thomas Frank on the receiving end of disgruntled Spurs fans.\n\nBefore his seemingly inevitable sacking the Dane was booed by home supporters once again - Tuesday's 2-1 defeat by Newcastle proving to be the final straw.\n\nWith Tottenham having won just two of their past 17 league matches, Frank himself acknowledged he understood the frustration of fans in one of his final interviews.\n\n\"I understand the frustration, I also understand the easiest thing is to point at me.\"\n\nFrank is not alone. Arne Slot and his players have had similar treatment at times this season, albeit from a much smaller number of the Liverpool faithful.\n\nIt's not just at Premier League games either. In the Women's Super League Brian Sorensen couldn't fail to hear the disgruntlement from sections of Goodison Park as Everton's dismal run of form led to his eventual sacking.\n\nWayne Rooney, who made headlines in 2010 after hitting out at England fans for booing the team, remembers being booed quite a lot in his career.\n\n\"It's always been there. Fans obviously have their opinions and sometimes they're with you and sometimes they're against you,\" he said.\n\n\"It's probably just picked up a little bit more now with more TV cameras, with social media and with phones filming from the stands.\n\n\"Obviously if a player or a player's family is getting abused at stadiums then it can become more of an issue, but generally I think booing is fine.\"\n\nLike his former England team-mate, Joe Hart agrees it's part of the game.\n\n\"You get booed by the away fans,\" said Hart. \"That's kind of par for the course. I've probably received a few from home fans in my time - not many. If I was being booed I was probably doing something wrong!\"\n\nBoth players think booing has always been there. But did it affect them?\n\n\"Maybe it did at the time,\" says Hart. \"I've got no scars from it though, put it that way. I was very much focused on what I was doing so whether I was getting applause or boos it didn't make any difference to how I tried to play the game.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool, Spurs and Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy also remembers difficult moments during his career.\n\n\"At Fulham when we were fighting relegation there were lots of boos,\" he explains. \"You have to take it as a challenge. You have to want to overcome it rather than go the other way and let it affect you, drain your energy and put fear into your play.\n\n\"I always felt like it was a challenge to overcome it, to try and do better. I think if you're playing Premier League football and you're at that level that's your job to do so.\n\n\"We all love it when the fans are singing your name when you've scored the winner or when the team's winning - you can't have just one and not the other.\"\n\nWhy do we boo in the first place? The answer lies in thousands of years of human evolution.\n\nStephen Smith is chair of the British Psychological Society's Division of Sport and Exercise Psychology.\n\n\"We love to believe we are logical, rational animals at the pinnacle of evolution but that's not how we work,\" Smith said. \"85-90% of human decisions are irrational, illogical and completely emotionally driven.\n\n\"When fans boo they make a sound which is guttural and vibrates through the bones, which means it has to be deep. It sounds like a hunting animal and it goes to the heart of our DNA.\n\n\"Emotions feed through a crowd like nothing else. Emotions are infectious. It only needs one or two people to start leading the booing and if someone else starts doing it you want to fit in with the tribe.\n\n\"The emotional part of the brain kicks in and says 'right, I want to display my emotions, the tribe around me are doing it with this behaviour, I'm going to fit in with them'. Booing is the most natural behaviour to show that you're displeased.\"\n\nSmith also thinks the psychological relationship between clubs and fans has changed.\n\n\"Previously there was almost an agreement that existed between fans and the club. They wanted you in to come and support the team, wear the colours and support the boys, but they weren't going to rip you off in terms of the cost.\n\n\"Clubs nowadays have changed that model, that psychological contract between club and fans is broken.\n\n\"They've said 'we're just going to treat you as any other customer, all we're interested in is what you have in your wallet, we're not actually interested in your loyalty to the club'.\"\n\nSo is booing your own team and manager ever justified? The fans we spoke to have mixed feelings.\n\nSpurs supporter Ali Speechly says she would never do it but can understand why some fans do: \"I've booed the ref during the game, but I don't think I've ever booed the manager.\n\n\"I think there's definitely a correlation between ticket prices and booing. When you're spending a lot of money on a product and you're not satisfied with that product then you feel more entitled as a consumer - rather than a fan - of voicing your disappointment and your frustration.\"\n\nFellow Spurs fan Darren Harvey says he would boo if the team was consistently bad.\n\n\"I would tend to feel similar to most other fans and therefore if there was booing and I agreed I'd probably go with it.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like certain things are quite funny to be part of a group and you don't think until afterwards that maybe you shouldn't have done that, you just get carried away in the moment.\"\n\nA Manchester United fan we spoke to is less keen, however: \"I heard the boos at Arsenal when they lost to United and I think they're spoilt fans to be honest.\n\n\"You shouldn't really boo your team, you should stick with them through thick and thin.\"\n\nOne supporter, who wishes to remain anonymous, thinks alcohol and drugs play a role.\n\n\"Because you can't drink, fans get tanked up before they come to the match and that creates more of a problem.\n\n\"I was at the Euros final when England lost to Italy. I witnessed men snorting cocaine right in front of me. The use of alcohol and drugs means fans don't care how they come across.\"\n\nThere is no doubt the mainstream media - including the BBC - plays a role in highlighting booing when it takes place.\n\nIn the case of Frank, the fact a large number of Spurs fans have booed this season is newsworthy and therefore inevitably makes headlines.\n\nSocial media plays a huge role too. Influencers - some with hundreds of thousands of followers - can help to spread a certain narrative.\n\nSpeechly says that probably makes fans more likely to boo: \"On social media, the people who get the most traction are the ones who are spreading negativity.\n\n\"Some people whip up a bit of a frenzy and lots of fans follow these people. They then go into the stadium having read and consumed that narrative online and they're already pre-fuelled with that rage.\"\n\nThis is where it gets tricky. It's difficult, perhaps impossible, to prove whether fans are booing their own team and manager more these days.\n\nCompared with a generation ago it's a safe bet to say booing is talked about more nowadays because of the proliferation of media. It's probably hard for fans to escape all that noise.\n\nLet's get the final word from someone who has been on the receiving end of boos.\n\n\"In an ideal world it makes no sense because if its anything that's likely to affect your players' performance and then affects your team's result why would you do it?\" says Murphy.\n\n\"But we don't live in this idealistic world where everyone is logical. The passion of football fans is what makes the game great.\"\n\nFollow your Premier League club and get news, analysis and fan views sent direct to you",

    "fullText": "Igor Thiago has reflected on his childhood watching Manchester United, which is where his love for football was first established.\n\nThe Brentford talisman chatted with TNT Sports ahead of his side’s clash with league leaders Arsenal last night.\n\nAfter being asked whether he’d always dreamed of being a professional player, he responded: “No, I didn’t even like it that much. But my brother started talking to me and made me watch the Premier League every weekend, especially Manchester United.\n\n“And then I started paying closer attention to United. From there it grew on me with feelings of love and affection. Then, I wanted to become a player too”.\n\n(Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nWhile a striker addition isn’t United’s priority heading into the summer window, it’s certainly an admission that’ll have sparked the interest of INEOS chiefs.\n\nThiago is enjoying a tremendous campaign leading the Bees’ frontline – in a season in which they were widely anticipated to struggle in the absence of Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.\n\nHowever, they, as much as Keith Andreews might want to play down the prospect, are well in the mix for a European finish, and Thiago has been crucial to that.\n\nThe 24-year-old has netted a remarkable 17 goals in 26 matches, ranking him second-placed behind Erling Haaland in the Golden Boot race.\n\nHe has outscored costly summer signings such as Joao Pedro and Hugo Ekitike, both of whom are on 10 goals each, as well as Antoine Semenyo (13 goals), who moved from Bournemouth to Manchester City last month.\n\n(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nIn fact, United fans might recall that Thiago was on the scoresheet twice earlier this term when Brentford hosted the Reds at the Gtech Community Stadium back in September.\n\nHaving been injured for his team’s visit in 2024/2025, the Brazilian will experience Old Trafford for the first time in April, when United will be looking to avenge their 3-1 defeat, this time with Michael Carrick in the dugout.\n\nIn-form Premier League talisman says watching Man Utd with ‘love and affection’ made him want to be a player\n\nOwen fires warning to Man Utd that it’s going to be ‘nigh on impossible’ to replace star who could leave in summer\n\nMail: United ‘expected to make offer’ for £180k-a-week star with agreement now looking ‘increasingly likely’",

    "description": "Garage 66 and Live Fast made it over chartered organization affiliated programs",
    "fullText": "Just like everyone predicted, BJ McLeod Motorsports and Garage 66 made it into the Daytona 500 over cars fielded by RFK Racing, Front Row Motorsports and a Richard Childress Racing affiliate.\n\nIn the words of Casey Mears, driving the Garage66 for Carl Long, anything can happen at Daytona.\n\nIt’s the reason McLeod and Mears signed up to drive figurative knives to a figurative gunfight. When everyone is in the draft, with the potential of missing a 20-car melee, there’s a non-zero chance for even underdogs to The Great American Race.\n\n“I think when it comes to the superspeedways and places like Daytona, absolutely,” Mears said. “I can't tell you throughout my career, I've been with some of the best teams and I've been with some of the smallest programs, and nothing surprises me here.\n\n“You come here sometimes with a big team and think you've done everything right in the off-season, you qualify 25th. I came here with a really small team in 2019 and we locked our way in the show on speed.\n\n“This is just one of those places where there's enough random things that happen and stuff that happens that's out of your control. Sometimes you're on the right side of it and sometimes you're not. Fortunately today we were on the right side.”\n\nIt certainly didn’t look that way when he spun in the grass during his pit stop and lost a lap. He caught one lucky break during the next caution and then another one when Corey Lajoie and Chandler Smith both crashed ahead of him.\n\nHe sank his right foot as deep as it would go into the pedal and was scored as the transfer when the race-ending caution came out.\n\nWatch: Casey Mears reacts to wild final moments in Duel 1\n\nAnthony Alfredo disqualified, removed from Daytona 500 field\n\nBJ McLeod’s situation was even more dire. The checkered flag waived and he was eliminated from the Great American Race. Anthony Alfredo had raced his way in and that was that until NASCAR took a look at the car during post-race inspection.\n\nThere, it was found that he had two cooling hoses (transaxle and driver) not fully secured and was disqualified. Thus, McLeod is in the race, because anything can happen at Daytona.\n\n“I hate that for them,” McLeod told FOX Sports. “Anthony and Linda, they’re awesome people. I congratulated them the moment we stopped on pit road. I was so happy for them getting in the race.\n\n“That’s a hard deal but in 2024, we had the car we needed to beat a lap down and easily could have rode around but ended up racing and got in a wreck. You never know, because these duels are crazy, and I absolutely love them and that’s why I keep coming back and trying.”\n\nIt’s the reason why Alfredo was on the verge of tears making a race for the third time, but for the first time through the duels one year after he failed to advance through them, only to lose it in inspection.\n\nTheoretically, the same thing could happen on Sunday. Maybe Mears and McLeod make it through the big multi-car crashes and end up racing for second. Maybe that hypothetical leader fails inspection.\n\nMaybe they get the right push and end up in the lead after the white flag and a caution ends the race. It’s the Daytona 500 where anything can happen.\n\n“I think we've seen that in the past,” Mears said. “I think if you're in the show, you have a shot.”\n\nTony Stewart returns to NASCAR in rare media form\n\nIs NASCAR going to let Garrett Mitchell be Cleetus McFarland?\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The January transfer window in Germany might have closed on February 2 (ironic, is it not?) but other transfer windows remained open past that date. Ergo there were still some outgoings at Bayern Munich as well as a very late confirmation of an incoming signing. Here is the list of the final transfer activity of the 2026 January transfer window at the Bayern Campus:\n\nMax Mergner- permanent transfer to Austria Vienna, as captured by @iMiaSanMia_GER\n\nMax Mergner lined up for Bayern’s U-23s in the first half of the 2025/26 season but lost his pre-season to an ankle injury. Even when the 19-year-old midfielder came back from this injury, he played just 124 minutes in total for the team. A change was in order and it arrived through a permanent transfer to Austrian Bundesliga side Austria Vienna.\n\nDavid Emmanuel- loan to KSV Hessen Kassel cut short, as captured by @iMiaSanMia_GER\n\n19-year-old defensive midfielder David Emmanuel was loaned out to KSV Hessen Kassel back in the January transfer window of 2025. However, he only played 5 minutes the rest of the season for the team in the Regionalliga Südwest, one of the 5 different regional fourth divisions in Germany. There was hope he would be able to push his way into the picture a little more following a pre-season and further acclimatization at the club, but he only played 1 minute in the first half of the 2025/26 season. Seeing no future at Hessen Kassel for Emmanuel, Bayern broke off the loan and brought him back to the club. He is eligible for either the U-19s or the U-23s and it will be interesting to see which team he will join.\n\nAllan Bohomo- New signing as a free agent, as captured by @iMiaSanMia_GER\n\n17-year-old center back Allan Bohomo joins Bayern’s U-19s as a free agent. 6 months after his contract at RB Leipzig ended, the 1.93 meter tall Bohomo joins Bayern to bolster the defensive ranks.",

Nostalgia should not rule such an important decision.\n\nDe Zerbi is the way to go, and Spurs should be doing everything to get him to sign on the dotted line.\n\nEven if he is not keen on taking on a new job immediately, Spurs must find an interim to hold the seat for him until the end of the season.",

    "fullText": "NEW HAVEN - The Bethel boys and Windsor girls won Class L indoor track and field championships Thursday night at the Floyd Little Athletic Center.\n\nFor Bethel, it was a long time coming. For Windsor, its was a 10th straight crown.\n\nThe Bethel boys exorcised a painful memory from the 2025 outdoor season after coming excruciatingly close to winning a Class MM title only to lose to Daniel Hand by a half-point after a post-meet recount.\n\nOn Thursday, Bethel rode tremendous efforts in field events past Windsor 60-55 for the L title.\n\nWith two events remaining, the pole vault and 4x400, the Wildcats trailed the Warriors 45-39. Bethel picked up 17 points in pole vault for a 56-45 lead, and that sealed the meet.\n\n\"To come around with this, and these guys, when last year's team was so strong. They have come back, and they have done amazing things,\" said Bethel coach Yvonne Grimes, who has been at the school for 31 years. \"I'm so proud of them, because they're all scrappy. They weren't thought of to be the best team there. We weren't even considered in the top part of that group, but they weren't going to let that happen.\n\n\"We may not have been strong on the track, but we were really strong in the field today. Seventeen points in the pole vault, those guys put us over the top.\"\n\nIn the pivotal pole vault, George Habshey won gold at 13 feet, 6 inches, Kubrik Tarrant tied for third and George Anastasakis was fifth to spur Bethel.\n\nThe Wildcats' Khao Ly won the long jump at 22-8¼, while Marcus Graham and Vincent Tan were third and fifth in the high jump, respectively. Jacob Topham took fifth in the shot put.\n\n\"I don't even believe it,\" Grimes said about the victory. \"I'm going to wake up tomorrow and think ‘did that really happen?'\"\n\nBethel has had an indoor track program since 2009 after going without one from 1984-2008. The Wildcats have three boys state championships listed on the CIAC site: 1946, 1967 and 1973.\n\nThe Windsor girls won the Class L crown for the 10th straight year, a run that began in 2016, with 2021 not contested due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOverall, the Warriors have won 11 Class L championships, all of them since 2012.\n\nWindsor scored 105 points to second-place New Canaan's 49.33.\n\n\"We practiced hard, everybody practiced hard,\" Windsor coach Kelvan Kearse said. \"I pushed those girls really hard, and they stepped up. We had goals set for them, and each one of them met their goals.\"\n\nWindsor senior Tomari Gillespie was a double winner individually, and part of a record-breaking 4x200 relay.\n\nWarriors junior Paige Wilson won the 300 and was part of the winning 4x200 and 4x400 relays. Junior Maya Donzella won the 1,600 (5:12.32) and was part of the meet record-breaking 4x400 relay, along with Wilson, senior Evelyn Schwartz and sophomore Ava Coleman (4:04.08).\n\nWindsor senior Alisha Smith won the shot put at 37-9.\n\nGillespie started as part of a record-breaking 4x200 relay.\n\nGillespie and Wilson (first leg), junior Layla Harris (third leg) and senior Jaida Murray (anchor leg) ran the 4x200 in 1:43.67. That toppled the time of 1:44.46 turned in by Windsor in 2024.\n\nWhat did Gillespie do for an encore? Win gold in back-to-back short races, the 55-meter hurdles and 55 dash. Gillespie took the hurdles in 8.30. About two seconds after Gillespie was announced as the hurdles winner, she took first in the dash in 7.22.\n\nGillespie's relay teammates were no slouches. Harris was second to Gillespie in the 55 hurdles (8.58) and Murray was third in the 55 (7.26), finishing just behind runner-up Kyla Mclean of Stratford (7.24).\n\nWindsor senior Shelldon Simpson II was the top seed entering the 55 dash, and he got to the final, where he had his sights set on his father Shelldon's 2000 record of 6.37, set while the older Simpson competed at East Hartford High.\n\nShelldon Simpson II won the 55 dash in 6.38 seconds, but after he crossed the line, he put his hands up to his head, knowing that he had missed his father's record by one-hundredth of a second.\n\nLater in the meet, Simpson II won gold in the 300 in a record time of 34.50, eclipsing the old mark of 34.75 run by the late Daundre Barnaby of Weaver in 2009.\n\nAt Floyd Little Athletic Center, New Haven\n\nBoys team results (Top 10): 1.

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior has now confirmed that defender Tosin Adarabioyo has finally returned to full team training.\n\nThe news comes ahead of Rosenior getting set to take on his former club Hull City in the FA Cup later this evening, but this game will certainly come much too soon for Tosin to be involved in.\n\nAlthough, Rosenior has left it all rather up in the air and suggests that actually, a decision on Tosin will be made with his medical team today, as to whether he can be involved or not tonight. So it is a possibility.\n\nTosin Adarabioyo in a Champions League press conference. (Photo by Chris Lee/Chelsea FC)\n\nIn words cited on X last night, Rosenior said on Tosin:\n\n“Tosin trained fully for the first time today [Wednesday], so it might come a little bit too soon. But we’ll make that judgement tomorrow with the medical team.”\n\nThis would mean that he has had two days of training ahead of the game tonight, so there is a chance that he might come back into the squad to let other key players rest. Let’s see what happens with the starting team selection when it comes out later on.\n\nAnother player who could get some very rare minutes tonight even though it would be a real shock still if he does, is deep backup goalkeeper Teddy Sharman-Lowe, who was recalled early from his loan with Bolton in the winter.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamie Carragher does not rate Chelsea’s summer signing of Liam Delap and believes the striker should have gone to a lesser club before he moved to a big club like Chelsea, making the switch from Ipswich Town.",

    "fullText": "Above all, the first half of yesterday’s Spanish Cup semi-final first leg will haunt everyone who supports Barca for a long time to come.\n\nFirst, a catastrophic first touch by keeper Garcia led to an early deficit, then Griezmann, Lookman, and Alvarez put three more past the Catalans before the halftime whistle.\n\nFour goals conceded, a defense in deep sleep, and numbers that show just how historically poor this first half from Barca really was:\n\nThe last time FC Barcelona trailed by four goals at halftime in a competitive match was in 1953. Back then, it was, of all teams, Real Madrid who handed them this defeat with a 0:4 in the league.\n\nThree goals conceded within 33 minutes: a situation Barca hadn’t experienced since that pitch-black night against Bayern in the 2020 Champions League. Back then, Hansi Flick was also involved, but on the opposing team’s bench.\n\n📸 Angel Martinez - 2026 Getty Images\n\nNew signing Joan García has already made four errors leading directly to a goal across all competitions since the start of last LaLiga season. In Spain, only Paulo Gazzaniga has a worse record in the same period (six), while David Soria matches the Spanish keeper’s tally.\n\nEven though the second half was much more balanced and Barcelona even scored a goal that was disallowed after a lengthy VAR review, in the end, it was a clear defeat—one that Atletico fans celebrated almost as much as a title.\n\n📸 Aitor Alcalde - 2026 Getty Images\n\nOn March 3, the Catalans will have a chance for redemption at home in the second leg. There’s still a glimmer of hope for a place in the final—after all, in football and especially in the cup, anything is possible.\n\nHowever, it’s already clear that center-back Eric will not be able to take part. To make matters worse for Barca, he was shown a red card for a professional foul in the 85th minute.\n\nWhat do you think—does Barca still have a chance at the final? Or is the dream of the title already over? Feel free to let us know in the comments.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "It’s been a great season for the Boston Celtics, including Jaylen Brown.\n\nThe Celtics head into the NBA All-Star Break with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference at 35-19. They also rank second in the NBA in points per game allowed, second in offensive rating and third in net rating.\n\nMeanwhile, Brown is having a fantastic season in Jayson Tatum’s absence. He’s emerged as an MVP candidate amid the best year of his career and will start the NBA All-Star Game on Sunday.\n\nBoston is surging, too, winning six of its last seven games after blowing out the Chicago Bulls at home on Wednesday night. After ending the first half on a high note, Brown is proud of what the team has accomplished so far and is excited to see what it can do in the second half.\n\n“I’m proud of this group and staff/ office looking forward to 2nd half go Cs,” Brown posted on his X account on Thursday night, accompanied by a graphic comparing the Celtics’ performance at the All-Star Break this year compared to last year.\n\nI’m proud of this group and staff/ office looking forward to 2nd half go Cs ☘️ pic.twitter.com/I0cqxQTPYg\n\n— Jaylen Brown (@FCHWPO) February 13, 2026\n\nShockingly, the numbers are eerily similar despite Boston’s major roster turnover since then. The Celtics are a totally different team now after losing Kristaps Porzingis, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford and Luke Kornet over the offseason, not to mention Tatum to injury.\n\nAnd yet, Boston is still second in the East and third in net rating at the break, just like last year.\n\nThe Celtics’ remarkable consistency is due to several factors, including Brown’s stellar year, his teammates stepping up and Joe Mazzulla’s terrific coaching. Boston has persevered in the face of adversity this season, bringing the energy and intensity every night and usually finding a way to win.\n\nThe Celtics rebound well, shoot a lot of 3-pointers, play hard on defense and take care of the basketball. That’s been a recipe for success this season, and it may be even more effective after the All-Star Break if Tatum returns soon.\n\nWhen Is Celtics’ Next Game? Date, Time, How To Watch Boston’s Return After All-Star Break",

It featured an immersive storyline centered around a mysterious murder involving Aunt Bethesda, where participants had to uncover the culprit by building two technical projects.\n\nTo get invited to Midnight, you had to make multiple projects totaling 50 hours to buy a ticket. I first planned to make 5 projects of 10 hours each, but I ended up doing a sixth project (bubulb) to get a sleeping bag so I didn’t have to bring mine.\n\nHere’s a short recap of all my projects:\n\n“Someone is plotting to kill Aunt Bethesda, and we’ve been invited to Vienna to try to stop it.” For this, we had to code 2 technical projects and show them to the task force (organizing team) to gain points (stickers) that we could then use to get clues from suspects. We also win merch after reaching some milestones: a lanyard for coming to Midnight, stickers after showcasing our ideas, keychains for shipping our first project, a tote bag for the second, and finally a hoodie for having ten points.\n\nOur first app was a case tracking app where you could put every piece of information you knew about the case (suspects, evidence, testimonies, etc…) and during your investigation, you would be assisted by Benoit Blanc from Knives Out.\n\nI was in charge of the backend while Aleksej and Andrej (my teammates) were working on the frontend. I chose to use DuckDB because it was something I had recently discovered and really liked, and FastAPI because I wanted to learn it. For the frontend, they chose to use React and Tailwind, and the AI behind Benoit Blanc is qwen3-32b from Hackclub AI.\n\nI think I can divide the development of the backend into three parts: setup, routes, and REST API slop. The setup was pretty boring, as I just needed to make a bunch of endpoints that returned sample data just so my teammates could work on the frontend.\n\nMaking the routes was actually fun because I had to design the database schemas and everything needed to make the app work. That’s when I switched from Flask to FastAPI. This is also where I met a fairly big problem: DuckDB isn’t thread-safe, while FastAPI is multi-threaded. To solve this, I used one connection per thread instead of one connection for the whole program. This might not be the safest or fastest solution, but it is the one that worked on the spot.\n\nThe REST API slop part was the most boring, as I needed to implement PUT, DELETE and PATCH methods for all the endpoints I previously made (6 endpoints, so 3*6 = 18 new methods to implement), and that’s where I used AI. I implemented all 3 methods perfectly on the parties endpoint and asked Amp to do the same thing for all 5 other endpoints.\n\nI’d say this project was the best one (or at least the most complete) as we spent a lot of time on it because we weren’t sleep-deprived like we were on the 2nd. On a technical side, I’m very proud of it as the backend has every functionality we wanted, and they’re fully documented with OpenAPI and Pydantic models. I even spent time making a script to populate the database with the Midnight case instead of inserting random data through DuckDB CLI. I honestly don’t think I could have done anything better on this first project; I’m satisfied with the backend, the stack, and the documentation.\n\nYou can find Casemate source code on DjukicAleksej/aidetective\n\nSaber Strike is a browser-based rhythm game inspired by Beat Saber, but instead of controlling the sabers with controllers, sabers are controlled by hand movements using your camera.\n\nThe project is fully written in Typescript using React, Three.js, and Google’s MediaPipe for tracking hand movements. I was in charge of track generation; I had to generate x seconds of gameplay at 130 BPM. For that, I chose a pattern-based approach; there are 5 patterns that are randomly selected. Each pattern is composed of multiple notes that the player has to slash from a specific direction:\n\nI had a smaller role in this project as I started to feel my lack of sleep, and the floor I slept on during the first night wasn’t the best bed I ever tried. Contrary to the first project, there are several things I would improve, the first being how I generate tracks from songs; I would have liked to have a more accurate method to generate them using beat detection with a Markov chain for patterns because currently, the probability of getting Short Rest twice is the same as getting Jumps twice.\n\nYou can find Saber Strike source code on DjukicAleksej/saberstrikess\n\nMidnight was an incredible experience that pushed me far beyond my comfort zone. Building two complete projects in just 4 days was really fun, exhausting, but absolutely worth it. On the technical side, I went from being curious about FastAPI and DuckDB to shipping a production-ready backend with full OpenAPI documentation. I learned to handle thread-safety issues on the fly and embraced TypeScript for the first time. The sleep deprivation was real, and I can see areas where I’d improve both projects given more time. But that’s the beauty of hackathons: you ship what works, learn from what doesn’t, and come out the other side with experience and new skills. Beyond the code, Midnight gave me something more valuable: connections with brilliant people who share the same passion for building things.",

    "description": "The White House correspondent shared an anecdote from last May, when the White House press secretary helped her out during an overseas trip despite the administration's attacks on her back at home",
    "fullText": "Kaitlan Collins talked about an \"important\" moment between her and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt while they were in Saudi Arabia early in Trump's second term\n\nIn a new podcast interview, Collins said Leavitt stepped in after the Saudi Royal Guard \"freaked out\" at her for shouting a question during a public appearance\n\nThough Collins gave Leavitt \"credit\" for backing her up at the time, the White House correspondent has recently found herself at the receiving end of attacks from the Trump administration\n\nKaitlan Collins opened up about a positive moment with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt early on in President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nDuring a new interview on Heather McMahan's Absolutely Not podcast, CNN's chief White House correspondent revealed that Leavitt once came to her defense during a trip to Saudi Arabia.\n\nCollins — who was more recently called “stupid and nasty” by Trump — recalled a moment on the May 2025 trip when she shouted a question to the president as he stood alongside other world leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n\"They famously do not like the media there,” Collins, 33, told McMahan. “To put it lightly.”\n\nTrump didn't answer Collins' shouted question, and after Saudi leaders left the room, Collins said the Saudi Royal Guard \"freaked out\" at her because she “dared to ask a question, and they’re not used to that because they don’t have a free press.\"\n\n“They came up and they said, ‘OK, well you can’t come into the next event,’ which was like two minutes later,” Collins recalled. “And I was like, ‘That’s not how this works. I go into the U.S. press,’ and they were like, ‘Well, you’re not coming in.’ ”\n\nCollins went on to explain that White House staff weren’t sure how to go about the situation, so they turned to Leavitt, 28.\n\n“To her credit, she said, ‘No, Kaitlan’s coming in with the rest of the U.S. press,’ and we went in,\" Collins said, referring to Leavitt. “And so it didn’t become this huge issue.”\n\nCollins went on to say Leavitt’s reaction was “important,” noting, “Especially when you’re kind of the U.S. contingent abroad, and we don’t do things like they do in Saudi Arabia.”\n\nThough Leavitt backed Collins up when she was almost shut out by Saudi security on the international trip, the CNN reporter has faced tension with the Trump White House back at home amid the administration's attempts to erode trust in the media.\n\nTrump and Leavitt have a history of lashing out at reporters when they pose questions that the White House finds unfavorable, and Collins has been at the receiving end of hostility multiple times.\n\nAt a CNN town hall in 2023 during the GOP presidential primaries, Trump called Collins a \"nasty person\" for asking about the federal investigation into his handling of classified documents. (Weeks after the town hall, the DOJ indicted him on seven criminal counts, including violating the Espionage Act, though the case was thrown out by a Trump-appointed judge before he was tried.)\n\nIn a lengthy rant shared on Truth Social in December, Trump described Collins as “stupid and nasty” for inquiring about his controversial White House ballroom renovation — though Collins replied to his attack by saying that her question was \"technically\" about his threats toward Venezuela.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Feb. 3, Trump lashed out at Collins in person after show the White House press corps a new red-and-white baseball cap that read, “America is back.”\n\n\"Look, CNN is thrilled,” Trump said, before adding, \"She never smiles. Someday I'll see her smile,\" referring to Collins.\n\nShortly after, Collins could be heard asking the president a question while he was talking to a different reporter. “What did you say? Go ahead, CNN,\" Trump said.\n\n“What would you say to the survivors…” Collins, asked, referring to the survivors of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n“You are the worst reporter. No wonder CNN... CNN has no ratings because of people like you. You know she’s a young woman,” Trump interjected, referring to Collins. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile. I’ve known you for 10 years, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a smile on your face.”\n\n“Well I’m asking you about survivors,” Collins replied.\n\n“You know why you’re not smiling? Because you know you’re not telling the truth,\" Trump added. \"You’re a very dishonest organization and they should be ashamed of you.”",

    "title": "3 Trillion-Dollar Stocks That Can Soar Up to 90% in 2026, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
    "description": "Wall Street's high-water price targets imply that a trio of magnificent stocks will skyrocket between 69% and 90% this year.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500, is enjoying a historic run. Since 1928, it's gained at least 16% in three consecutive years on three separate occasions. Two of those three periods have occurred since 2019 (2019-2021 and 2023-2025).\n\nWhile game-changing technological trends, such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), have played a role in catapulting the broader market to new heights, it's Wall Street's trillion-dollar companies that have done a lot of the heavy lifting. Including Walmart, which became the newest member of the trillion-dollar club last week, 12 companies listed on U.S. exchanges have reached the elusive $1 trillion market cap.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nAlthough it's unlikely that trillion-dollar stocks will deliver truly jaw-dropping investment returns going forward, these companies are, nonetheless, industry leaders that are fully capable of heading even higher -- and Wall Street analysts know it.\n\nWhile analysts are collectively bullish on all 12 trillion-dollar stocks listed in the U.S., there's outsize optimism for three of these companies. Based on the price targets of select Wall Street analysts, the following members of the trillion-dollar club can soar up to 90% in 2026.\n\nThe first trillion-dollar stock that's projected to skyrocket this year is the face of the AI revolution, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). As of February 2026, 63 Wall Street analysts have weighed in on Nvidia, with 59 rating it the equivalent of a strong buy or buy. One of these 59 analysts is Mark Lipacis of Evercore ISI, the institutional equities division of Evercore. Lipacis sees Nvidia's shares rising to $352, representing 90% upside from its Feb. 6 closing price.\n\nPretty much every analyst and everyday investor recognizes the data center dominance that Nvidia brings to the table. Its Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra graphics processing units (GPUs) hold a near monopoly in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nLipacis' outsize optimism is based on the belief that Nvidia will be the undisputed beneficiary of AI-driven parallel processing. In other words, customers will be able to leverage the compute superiority of Nvidia's GPUs and its CUDA software platform to run simultaneous tasks. With CEO Jensen Huang overseeing the rollout of an advanced GPU annually, it's unlikely that any external competitors will match or surpass the compute capabilities of Nvidia's AI hardware anytime soon.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a barrage of ballistic missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities in overnight attacks, officials reported on Thursday as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Moscow was “hesitating” about another round of U.S.-brokered talks on stopping the fighting.\n\nWashington has proposed further negotiations next week between Russian and Ukrainian delegations either in Miami or Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, which was the location of the last meeting, Zelenskyy said late Wednesday.\n\nUkraine “immediately confirmed” it would attend, he said. “So far, as I understand it, Russia is hesitating,” Zelenskyy told reporters in a messaging app interview late Wednesday.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that another round of talks was expected “soon” but gave no further details.\n\nAmerican officials made no comment on the possibility of further talks as part of a yearlong peace effort by the Trump administration. Zelenskyy said last week that the United States has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal.\n\nBut with Russia’s invasion of its neighbor marking its fourth anniversary later this month, disagreements between Moscow and Kyiv over key issues have held up a comprehensive settlement. The issues include who keeps the Ukrainian land that Russia’s army has so far occupied, especially in the eastern Donbas industrial heartland, and Moscow’s demands for Kyiv to surrender more territory.\n\nUkraine wants Western-backed security guarantees, including a date for joining the European Union, and a postwar reconstruction package in place before it can contemplate signing a proposed 20-point settlement, Zelenskyy said.\n\nRussia has meanwhile continued to pound Ukrainian civilian areas, including residential areas and the power grid, and Moscow has not responded to a U.S. proposal for an “energy ceasefire” that would also halt Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil facilities, Zelenskyy said.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, urged Russia to stop hitting electricity infrastructure, reminding Moscow in a statement that targeting civilian infrastructure is prohibited under international humanitarian law.\n\nOvernight from Wednesday to Thursday, Russia fired 219 long-range strike drones, 24 ballistic missiles and a guided aircraft missile at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian air force.\n\nThe main targets were the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the second-largest city of Kharkiv, Dnipro in central Ukraine, and the southern port city of Odesa, the air force said — all cities that have come under relentless bombardment.\n\nIn Dnipro, Russian strikes injured four people, including a 4-year-old girl and a newborn boy, regional head Oleksandr Hanzha wrote on Telegram.\n\nIn Kyiv, several residential buildings were damaged, and two people were injured, according to the city administration.\n\nIn Odesa, one person was injured as a residential high-rise was partially destroyed and a market and a supermarket caught fire, regional head Oleksandr Hanzha wrote on Telegram.\n\nTemperatures have moved above freezing point in Kyiv, but it is still bitterly cold in the city.\n\nOleksii Kuleba, deputy prime minister for the restoration of Ukraine, said 2,600 buildings were left without heating after the Kyiv attack in addition to 1,100 buildings in the capital that already were without heating due to previous attacks.\n\nIn Odesa, nearly 300,000 residents were left without running water, Kuleba said, while in Dnipro the central heating system stopped working for some 10,000 people.\n\nUkraine has hit back at Russia with long-range strikes on military targets and oil refineries that generate a large slice of Russia's income.\n\nUkraine’s military general staff said Thursday that one of its domestically developed long-range drones hit the Ukhta oil refinery in Russia’s Komi region, around 1,750 kilometers (1,000 miles) from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAn official with Ukraine’s Security Service, known as the SBU, told The Associated Press that it was the first time Ukrainian drones have flown so far. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nUkraine’s general staff also said that one of its domestically produced, long-range “Flamingo” missiles hit one of the Russian military’s biggest storage sites for missiles, ammunition and explosives in the Volgograd region and caused major explosions.\n\nSeparately, Ukrainian forces also hit and started a fire at the Michurinsk Progress Plant in Russia’s Tambov region, a defense enterprise producing high-technology equipment for aviation and missile systems, the General Staff said.\n\nUkraine's military also confirmed it damaged the Volgograd oil refinery in a strike the previous day.\n\nThe White House announced Thursday that first lady Melania Trump helped to reunite a small group of Russian and Ukrainian children with their families after they became separated by the invasion.\n\nFive children — four boys and one girl, from 4 to 15 years old — were reunited with their families in Ukraine, while one child returned to its family in Russia, according to Maria Lvova-Belova, the Kremlin’s commissioner for children’s rights.\n\nLvova-Belova is sought for war crimes by the International Criminal Court for allegedly deporting children from Ukraine.\n\nIt was the third such family reunification involving the first lady.\n\nKatie Marie Davies in Manchester, England contributed.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "In what experts have deemed a mass exodus, a steady flow of high-ranking executives and managerial employees have been leaving Tesla since 2024.\n\nThis trend displays a growing discontent with the automaker following the company's shift toward robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nElectrek reported \"Benjamin Bate, Tesla's Director of Vehicle Operations and Engineering at Fremont, has left the automaker after over eight years. … [It] adds to the now-constant stream of experienced talent leaving Tesla.\"\n\nFrom head engineers and program managers to model manufacturing leads, sales executives, and vehicle designers, Tesla has lost talent from every corner of its automotive workforce. A commenter even noted people seem to be \"leaving the sinking ship.\"\n\nBeyond concerns over the company's spiral, Tesla has also been reported to have a severe employee morale issue. High-level, high-value employees are losing interest in their work, as \"Tesla is no longer innovating or pushing the envelope in automobiles,\" per Electrek.\n\nCompared to other EV makers such as Chevrolet, BMW, Ford, and even luxury brands including Porsche, Tesla has made no significant upgrades to vehicle performance in recent years.\n\nTesla's lack of development as an automobile producer has depleted its once-titanic status as an EV staple into a company that is falling behind and seemingly making no effort to compensate. Tesla customers may be negatively impacted as a result, owning vehicles from an automaker that is no longer focused on those vehicles.\n\nAs Tesla sales continue to decline — one 2025 report showed a nearly 28% year-over-year drop — those who own a Tesla may be worried. Without high demand, service could decrease or become unreliable. Additionally, with less competition, consumers suffer from higher prices and perhaps an industry-wide downturn.\n\nWhile Tesla may be falling behind its competitors' innovations in electric vehicles, many other options have opened up because Tesla took the first steps.\n\nChina's BYD has become the world's leading EV maker thanks to affordable prices and continuous upgrades and improvements.

Allergic reactions to these nine foods vary but can involve “hives and lip swelling to severe, life-threatening symptoms, often called anaphylaxis, that may involve fatal respiratory problems and shock.”\n\nThere have been many different food recalls in the U.S. this year due to allergy risks. Last month, thousands of units of M&M’s products were recalled across more than a dozen states because their packaging did not include proper allergen warnings.\n\nThe recall was announced by the FDA after it emerged that more than 6,000 units had been repackaged by Beacon Promotions Inc. without advisories that they may contain milk, soy and peanuts.\n\nFirst issued January 26, the recall was elevated by the FDA to a Class II, meaning consuming the product could cause “temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences.”\n\nThe M&M’s in question were distributed in packaging that was labelled for promotional purposes, according to the FDA, and could contain any of the following promotional labels or packages listed here.\n\nThey were distributed in the following 20 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nAnyone who has the products in question and is allergic to or sensitive to nuts, soy, or milk should throw them away. Those who are not allergic or sensitive can safely consume them.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — A club promoter involved in a suspected DUI crash with a family visiting from the United Kingdom, which sent a child in a stroller airborne, was nearly three times the legal limit, according to documents 8 News Now obtained.\n\nGavin Caci, 28, of Henderson, faces charges including DUI resulting in substantial bodily harm and leaving the scene of a crash, records said. Caci’s social media accounts say he is a VIP club promoter.\n\nThe crash occurred Sunday, Feb. 8, around 7:35 p.m. near Harmon Avenue and Audrie Lane just east of the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nA preliminary blood test revealed Caci’s blood-alcohol level was 0.22 less than two hours after the crash, documents said. The legal limit in Nevada is 0.08 – meaning Caci was close to three times that number.\n\nCaci was driving eastbound on Harmon Avenue approaching the intersection with Audrie Lane when “he failed to maintain” his lane and drove up onto the sidewalk, police said. The car then re-entered the road, collided with another car, before Caci drove up on the sidewalk again, crashed into a power box, and collided with a woman and a 2-year-old in a stroller.\n\nThe pair was part of a trio visiting from the United Kingdom, police said. The child went airborne from the stroller during the crash, police said.\n\nCaci then left the crash site before another driver called 911 and began following him into a parking lot, documents said.\n\nArriving officers noted Caci “had bloodshot and watery eyes,” smelled of alcohol, and was speaking with slurred speech, documents said.\n\n“Mr. Caci denied using any drugs or consuming any alcoholic beverages,” police said. “When asked what and how much, he stated, ‘Give or take one or two.’” He stated he had tequila at a club and later believed he was at The Cosmopolitan Hotel, but could not recall the name of the club.”\n\nTwo pedestrians suffered severe injuries, including brain bleeds, police said.\n\nIn court on Wednesday, Caci pleaded not guilty. Two judges have denied setting bail, and during the brief hearing, his attorney only asked to schedule a preliminary hearing.\n\nThat hearing was scheduled for Feb 25.\n\nThe conditions of the two people severely injured were not updated as of Wednesday.\n\n8 News Now Investigator David Charns can be reached at dcharns@8newsnow.com.",

Common symptoms include fever and joint pain, as well as headaches, muscle pain, joint swelling, and a rash.\n\nWhile there are no known treatment options for chikungunya, death from the virus is rare.\n\nA level 2 advisory means that the CDC is encouraging travelers to “practice enhanced precautions.” The group recommends that anyone heading to the Seychelles get vaccinated for the disease beforehand.\n\nThe CDC also recommends preventing mosquito bites by using insect repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, and staying in places with air conditioning or that have screens on the windows and doors.\n\nAnyone pregnant should consider avoiding traveling to the area, the CDC said, as mothers can pass chikungunya to their children during delivery, and newborns infected with the disease are at risk for severe illness.\n\nPeople over age 65 or who have medical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease are more at risk for serious illness as well, the CDC said.\n\nIf you develop any of the symptoms of chikungunya, you should seek medical care during or after travel.\n\nThe Seychelles is an island republic located in the Indian Ocean near east Africa.

    "title": "Here's how smart people in tech are reacting to Matt Shumer's viral essay about what AI means for jobs",
    "description": "The sharpest minds in business and tech are responding to a viral essay on AI's impact on jobs with some approval and a lot of skepticism.",
    "fullText": "Scientists and business leaders are responding to a viral essay warning of AI's impact on jobs with a mix of agreement and skepticism.\n\nThe essay, titled \"Something Big is Coming,\" written by cofounder and CEO of OthersideAI, Matt Shumer, has racked up more than 60 million views on X as of Thursday.\n\nIn the 5,000-word post, Shumer said that AI could upend daily life on a scale \"much bigger\" than COVID, a comparison which drew pushback online. He wrote that the changes already unfolding in the tech sector are likely a preview of disruptions that could soon reach other industries as well.\n\n\"Even if there is a 20% chance of this happening, people deserve to know and have time to prepare,\" Shumer told Business Insider's Brent Griffiths in an interview.\n\nHere's what some of the sharpest minds in AI are saying about Shumer's essay.\n\nHaber, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz specializing in technology investments, posted on X that Shumer's essay contains \"great advice for how to get ahead in your job at any large company right now.\"\n\n\"'I used AI to do this analysis in an hour instead of three days is going to be the most valuable person in the room.' Not eventually. Right now,\" Haber quotes from the essay. \"Learn these tools. Get proficient. Demonstrate what's possible.\"\n\nThe Reddit founder responded to Shumer's initial post on X with a simple comment: \"Great writeup. Strongly agree.\"\n\nSince 2023, Reddit has introduced a range of AI-driven tools, from search features that summarize user discussions to AI that sharpens its content recommendations and targets ads, but Ohanian recently emphasized that the platform must retain its humanity to stay competitive.\n\nMarkowitz, the author and managing partner and director of research at Nightview Capital, a long-term-oriented investment firm, responded to Schumer with an essay almost as long, which criticized the practice of chasing speed and replacing the value of humanity simply because it could be done.\n\n\"These two worlds — Wall Street and Silicon Valley — have formed a feedback loop of short-termism so tight, so self-reinforcing, that they've confused efficiency with purpose, growth with meaning, and the elimination of people with progress,\" wrote Markowitz.\n\n\"I have two research assistants. Could I replace them with AI? Of course. But their value extends their weekly output,\" Markowitz added. \"They give meaning to my work and I love seeing the excitement in their faces when they make a new discovery that I, alone, could not have found.\"\n\n\"Let me say it again: we are not our tools. We never have been,\" Markowitz wrote in conclusion.\n\nMcLees, the founder of HumanSkills.AI, wrote on X that Shumer is not wrong, but he said that the advice Shumer provided is akin to \"telling someone the floodwaters are rising and handing them a better bucket.\"\n\n\"As AI grows in ability, our role in defining direction, values, and purpose only becomes more essential,\" McLees said.\n\n\"What do you bring when the machine can do the work? That's the only question that matters when intelligence is abundant,\" McLees added. \"Shumer wrote the alarm. It's a good one. But alarms don't tell you where to go. You have to find that within yourself.\"\n\nMarcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU and founder of AI companies Robust.AI, has some harsh words for Schumer in his newsletter.\n\nMarcuz called Shumer's blog post \"weaponized hype, filled with vivid narrative and marketing speech,\" and said he did not provide real data to support the claim that the latest AI can write complicated apps without mistakes.\n\n\"Shumer's presentation is completely one-sided, omitting lots of concerns that have been widely expressed here and elsewhere,\" Marcus added, after discussing various studies that question the accuracy and productivity gain AI tools actually provide.\n\nMisra, Vice Dean of Computing and Artificial Intelligence at Columbia University, responded in a lengthy Substack article that detailed why he doesn't think AI is as scary as it sounds, at least not right now.\n\nMisra wrote that many strange AI behaviors that make them seem sentient, such as perceived resistance and self-preservation, are simply a result of training data.\n\nAs for the possible elimination of jobs, Misra said he understands the anxiety, but history says we may not need to panic.\n\n\"When the camera was invented, portrait painters had every reason to panic. Their livelihood depended on a skill that a machine could now approximate,\" Misra wrote.\n\n\"What happened? Painters didn't disappear. They were freed from the obligation to faithfully reproduce reality and ventured into impressionism, cubism, abstract expressionism,\" Misra added. \"The camera didn't kill painting. It liberated it.\"",

    "title": "Kathy Ruemmler is leaving Goldman Sachs after more Epstein ties come to light",
    "description": "The bank's top lawyer is leaving, saying it was her duty \"to put Goldman Sachs' interests first.\"",
    "fullText": "Goldman Sachs' top lawyer is leaving the firm, after more documents from the Department of Justice's files on Jeffrey Epstein shed further light on the attorney's relationship with the convicted sex offender.\n\nKathy Ruemmler, previously a top attorney at Latham & Watkins, is resigning from Goldman effective June 30, her representative told Business Insider. She joined Goldman in 2020.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Ruemmler said it was her duty \"to put Goldman Sachs' interests first.\"\n\nGoldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement to Business Insider that he accepted Ruemmler's resignation and respected her decision.\n\n\"As one of the most accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed,\" he said.\n\nEpstein called Ruemmler and two others on the night of July 6, 2019, when he was arrested, according to notes released by the DoJ. A spokesperson for Ruemmler previously said the call was short.\n\nRuemmler confided in Epstein, who pleaded guilty to sex offenses in 2008, about intensely personal details about her life, and sought career and real estate advice. She talked with him about an affair, gushed over gifts of handbags and shoes, and asked him whether she should accept the chance to become Attorney General of the United States in the Obama administration. In one email, she called him \"Uncle Jeffrey.\"\n\nEpstein gave Ruemmler expensive gifts, including designer purses, prompting the attorney to write him in 2018, \"So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!\"\n\nThese emails and others were included in a trove of documents released by the Department of Justice last month under the bipartisan Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\nAlthough representatives for Goldman Sachs said Ruemmler never personally represented Epstein as an attorney, the emails showed her offering advice for fighting a lawsuit brought by women who accused him of sexual abuse and sought to undo a non-prosecution agreement reached with prosecutors. She also advised him on how to respond in the media to women who said he sexually abused them when they were underage.\n\nLast month, Goldman representative Tony Fratto said in a statement that it is \"well known that Epstein often offered unsolicited favors and gifts to his many business contacts.\"\n\n\"As Kathy has said many times, she had a professional association with Jeffrey Epstein when she was a lawyer in private practice, heading the defense and investigations practice at a global law firm,\" the statement said. \"She regrets ever knowing him.\"\n\nRuemmler is the latest high-profile figure to face consequences for connections to Epstein. Prominent attorney Brad Karp stepped down as chair of Paul Weiss, though he remains an attorney at the Big Law firm. Longevity researcher and CBS News contributor Peter Attia resigned from a protein bar company and is no longer an advisor for a high-tech mattress maker. Talent agency powerhouse Casey Wasserman is facing calls to resign from some clients, including singer Chappell Roan and soccer star Abby Wambach, who cut ties with the company that bears his name.",

    "description": "Robert Downey Jr. and his wife don't go two weeks without seeing each other, while Bette Midler swears by sleep divorce.",
    "fullText": "As it turns out, love in Hollywood runs on some pretty simple rules.\n\nThe lives of celebrities may be glamorous, but when they talk about what keeps their relationships strong, the habits they describe are often surprisingly down-to-earth.\n\nFrom how they date to how they sleep, the same eight themes keep coming up.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. and his wife, Susan, don't let their busy schedules get in the way.\n\n\"We do have a two-week rule, which often feels too long, but we don't go more than two weeks without seeing each other and the family being together,\" Susan Downey said.\n\nSimilarly, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and his wife, Tana, protect their time together with regular date nights — where sneakers are strictly off-limits.\n\n\"So we kind of dress up, you know. A nice dress, and I'll wear heels. He'll wear a suit or a shirt and proper shoes,\" Tana said. \"Proper time together,\" Tana Ramsay said.\n\nAfter all, it's all about putting in the effort to keep the flame alive, Kelsey Grammar said.\n\n\"I always say, 'Love is a contact sport,'\" he said. \"Once in a while you got to back it up with some action.\"\n\nFor some, sleeping apart has become a key to staying together.\n\nCarson Daly has called sleep divorce the \"best thing\" for his marriage. The \"Today\" host started sleeping separately from his wife when she was pregnant with their fourth child, in part due to his sleep apnea and loud snoring.\n\n\"We both, admittedly, slept better apart,\" he said.\n\nBette Midler has similarly said snoring played a role in her decision to sleep in separate bedrooms from her husband of more than 40 years.\n\nFor \"Shark Tank\" star Barbara Corcoran and her husband, separate bedrooms come with clear boundaries.\n\n\"I have to invite him into my bedroom, and I like it that way,\" Corcoran said.\n\nIn Jack Wagner's case, separate bedrooms aren't enough. The \"General Hospital\" star and his wife, who he married in 2025, live separately.\n\n\"She has her place. I still have mine,\" Wagner said. \"We're both super comfortable in our places and going back and forth, and so we've decided, let's not rock the boat.\"\n\nRob Lowe, who has been married to Sheryl Berkoff for over 30 years, said he and his wife have gone for counselling even when they \"didn't need it.\"\n\n\"It's like taking your car in and making sure the engine's running great,\" Lowe said.\n\n\"Freakier Friday\" actor Manny Jacinto has shared similar advice, saying one of the best relationship tips he's received is to start couples therapy before problems arise.\n\n\"You don't want to be going to couples therapy when you're in a really bad spot because sometimes it might be too late,\" Jacinto said.\n\nSome celebrities believe a strong partnership is the foundation of a strong family.\n\nAyesha Curry said she and Stephen Curry focus on their relationship first, before stepping into their roles as mom and dad.\n\n\"And that works for us because then you have two happy people raising the kids in the house. So the family sector in our lives always comes first,\" Curry said.\n\nKylie Kelce has shared a similar perspective, saying she makes a point to date and appreciate her husband, Travis Kelce, even though they're already married.\n\n\"Like, you chose to love them, you chose to let them love you, and you chose to build a life together,\" Kelce said.\n\n\"I love my kids with my whole heart and I always will, but I chose my husband. I didn't choose my kids. I got what I got with my kids,\" she added.\n\nEven without kids, that same principle still applies. Ina Garten said mutual consideration has been central to her nearly 60-year marriage.\n\nEvery decision she makes with her husband has to work for both of them, she said: \"It's not about whether we get to do what you want to do or I want to do.\"\n\nMixing business and marriage isn't easy, which is why some couples who work together set clear boundaries.\n\nJay Shetty and his wife, Radhi Devlukia, may run a sparkling tea brand together, but they avoid talking about work over dinner.\n\n\"That's not because I don't love what I do. I love what I do, but when I'm with her, I just want to be with her,\" Shetty said.\n\nNick Lachey co-hosts \"Love Is Blind\" with his wife, Vanessa, and says compartmentalizing helps them keep their relationship strong. Whatever happens at work stays at work, and vice versa.\n\n\"Sometimes you show up for work and there's an argument at home that you brought with you to work, and you don't want that to bleed over,\" Lachey said.\n\nSome celebrity couples say laughter is their secret weapon.\n\nGwen Stefani said there isn't a day she spends with Blake Shelton that goes by without laughter.\n\nFor Michelle Obama, that humor often comes in the form of teasing her husband, Barack Obama.\n\n\"I said, 'When I tease you, it's like, you know, it's like a love tap,\" Obama said, recalling her words to her husband.\n\nFor several celebrity power couples, closeness doesn't mean doing everything side by side. Supporting each other's individual lives is part of the deal.\n\nMichelle Yeoh said her husband, former Ferrari CEO Jean Todt, has always backed her jet-setting career. Despite long stretches apart, he's always deeply understanding of her passion for work.\n\n\"He never turns around and says you spend a lot of time away from me, which I have sometimes, but he's very understanding,\" Yeoh said.\n\nIn her long partnership with Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn has said maintaining independence is key.\n\n\"It's a freedom of self, it's a freedom of basically, not melding into somebody else,\" she said.\n\nWhen life takes an unexpected turn, some celebrities say that's when commitment matters most.\n\nJay Leno said he enjoys caring for his wife, Mavis, following her dementia diagnosis, and called it part of the promise he made when they married.\n\n\"At some point in my life, I'm going to be called upon to defend myself. I think that's really what defines a marriage. I mean, that's really what love is. That's what you do. I mean, I'm glad I didn't cut and run. I'm glad I didn't run off with some woman half my age or any of that silly nonsense. I would rather be with her than doing something else,\" Leno said.\n\nEmma Heming Willis has also been candid about the emotional complexity of caring for Bruce Willis after his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis.\n\n\"I carry it with me all the time, but I can also bring in happiness, too, and laughter, and be able to connect with other people that feels really special and meaningful, where I didn't ever think that I would get there,\" Heming Willis said.",

We are in probably the third or fourth inning of the actual build out,\" David Craver, the co-chief investment officer of Lone Pine Capital, said on Goldman Sachs' \"Exchanges\" podcast published Thursday.\n\nCraver added that while he understands concerns surrounding the vast sums of money being spent on AI, the underlying signals — improving models, tight capacity, and real-world business impact — suggest the cycle still has room to run.\n\nHe points to three signals that keep him bullish on AI infrastructure.\n\nFirst, the models are still improving as more computing power is thrown at them. \"They are absolutely getting better,\" and have more uses, he said.\n\nSecond, demand continues to outstrip supply as hyperscalers and inference providers still lack sufficient capacity, he said.\n\nThird — and most important — companies are already seeing dramatic returns from deploying AI internally.\n\nHe said founders and digital-first CEOs are describing \"mind-blowing\" productivity gains, from automated coding to replacing manual workflows with AI agents.\n\n\"We have had numerous CEOs say to us, 'I think I can triple or more the revenues in my business. And I'm never going to have to hire another human being,'\" Craver said.\n\nStill, not every company is seeing those kinds of returns on investment. According to PwC's latest Global CEO Survey, released last month, 56% of the 4,454 chief executives surveyed said AI has yet to deliver revenue or cost benefits for their businesses.\n\nEarly AI gains have gone primarily to infrastructure leaders like Nvidia and cloud providers. Craver thinks the next phase will be defined by adoption across large, incumbent companies.\n\n\"I have a theme that I call 'revenge of the dinosaurs,' which is, larger companies are going to adopt this technology and take cost out of their business in a huge way over the next two and three and four years,\" he said.\n\nHe said the impact would show up clearly in corporate earnings.\n\n\"I think we're going to get on conference calls in 2027, and CFOs are going to say, 'I just took half a billion dollars out of my spending on an annual basis because we're implementing this new technology,'\" he said.\n\nThat dynamic, in his view, is \"super bullish for the market.\"\n\nCraver's comments come at a fragile moment for AI-linked stocks, as investors grow more nervous after a blistering multi-year run.\n\nThis week, software stocks sold off as investors weighed the disruptive impact of AI against concerns about elevated valuations, aggressive capital spending, and whether the buildout has outpaced fundamentals.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurance brokerages, wealth managers, and real estate services firms — sectors seen as exposed to AI disruption — have fallen sharply.\n\nDespite the volatility, Craver said Lone Pine remains \"quite bullish on that overall bet\" on AI.\n\n\"It's not a bubble when everybody thinks it's a bubble,\" he said. \"It's going to be a bubble when we get to the other side of this.\"",

    "description": "Ukrainian OSINT groups pushed the ruse by pretending to complain about a Russian Telegram bot actually run by Kyiv's troops, the division said.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian cyberwarfare division said on Thursday that it created a fake Starlink registration service to trick Russian soldiers into giving up sensitive data.\n\nThe 256th Cyber Assault Division said it partnered with open-source intelligence groups to promote a network of Telegram channels and bots that offered to help the Kremlin's troops register Starlink terminals on a Ukrainian whitelist.\n\nBut the channels were a ruse, and had instead been run by Ukrainian forces, who were sent location and terminal data from the soldiers, the 256th said.\n\nIts statement is yet another example of how wartime operations have spilled into social media, and comes after repeated reports that Russian forces have been trying to circumvent a region-wide Starlink block by paying Ukrainian civilians to register terminals for them.\n\nSpaceX cut off connectivity in Ukraine earlier this month, allowing only terminals logged with the Ukrainian government to continue receiving service. The sweeping move was enacted after repeated reports that Russian forces were buying terminals on the black market to guide attack drones and run battlefield communications.\n\nRussia downplayed the impact of the geofenced block on its operations, but Kyiv officials say that attempts by the Kremlin's troops to register terminals indicate their need for the American-run service.\n\nIn its statement, the 256th said it leveraged those needs to connect with the Russian soldiers.\n\n\"Understanding how desperately this mold would look for ways to restore Elon Musk's dish network — and the threats this poses — we, together with InformNapalm and MILITANT, decided to 'help' them,\" the division wrote, citing the two groups it worked with.\n\nAccording to screenshots posted by the division, which appear to show interactions with Russian troops, the Telegram bots would ask the soldiers for information about their Starlink terminals.\n\nThe soldiers then appear to share details such as their terminal ID numbers, satellite dish numbers, Starlink account numbers, and their location coordinates in latitude and longitude.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the authenticity of these screenshots.\n\nThe 256th said it collected 2,420 data entries on Russian Starlink terminals and their \"precise\" locations, as well as $5,870 from Moscow's troops paying for the faux service.\n\nThe division added that 31 Ukrainians had approached its network asking for opportunities to help Russians register terminals.\n\nInformNapalm, a Ukrainian-European OSINT group, said in a statement that it played a \"supporting role\" in the operation by pretending to complain about Telegram channels that were supposedly aiding Russians with Starlink registration.\n\nOn Monday, the group had posted about a channel named \"russian_starlink,\" which it wrote was surging in popularity but had still not been blocked by Ukrainian authorities.\n\n\"That was already one of the stages of drawing Russian military personnel even deeper into the 'honeypot,'\" the group wrote of the Monday post.\n\nMILITANT, a Ukrainian OSINT group that shared InformNapalm's Monday post, called the initiative \"Operation Self-Liquidation.\"\n\n\"As for the coordinates they sent, packages were sent back. 155s,\" the group wrote, referencing 155mm artillery shells.\n\nThe 256th said it sent the Russian data entries to Serhii Sternenko, an advisor on drone logistics and technology for Ukraine's defense ministry. A spokesperson for Sternenko's foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nIn a separate statement on X, InformNapalm said that the deception's \"intended effect has been achieved,\" indicating that the operation has concluded.",

    "description": "\"I always wanted to be an old guy who's still feeling pretty good,\" Ernie Hudson said.",
    "fullText": "At 80, Ernie Hudson still works out regularly — and it's all part of his longevity journey.\n\nIn an interview with Men's Health published on Wednesday, the \"Ghostbusters\" actor said he sees regular exercise as a way for him to live well for longer.\n\n\"I guess I'm excited because turning 80 is great. A number I never thought I'd see, but here it is. I always wanted to be an old guy who's still feeling pretty good,\" Hudson told Men's Health.\n\nOver the years, he's come to realize the importance of tuning into his body and paying close attention to what it needs. \"You just have to quiet your mind enough to listen,\" he said.\n\nThat philosophy guides how he approaches fitness today.\n\n\"My biggest goal right now is just to stay alive,\" Hudson said. \"Weight becomes a big issue the older you get, especially if you're from my community, the African American community. Every disease known to man seems to hit us harder, so it's really important to get the exam, to stay flexible, to stay as mobile as you can.\"\n\nHe added that mobility becomes especially critical with age.\n\n\"The older you get, you want to be at least flexible, so you're not stumbling and falling down, which is the number one hazard. Falling and breaking something,\" Hudson said.\n\nAt home in Los Angeles, he trains with a personal trainer two to three times a week. When he's traveling or in New York City, he swaps in a different workout partner: his son.\n\n\"It gives me a chance to hang out in his favorite place, which is the gym,\" Hudson said.\n\nMuch of Hudson's training centers on building and maintaining upper-body strength, with workouts that include pushups, seated rows, and barbell bench presses.\n\nHe added that he has always believed in having strong arms, \"so you appear that you can at least defend yourself.\"\n\nNot only that, Hudson said he feels the need to stay in top shape whenever he takes on a role, even if it isn't especially physical.\n\n\"It's important for a character that you're able to lose yourself in that world,\" he said.\n\nBeing fit makes it easier to focus on his job because he isn't distracted by any physical discomfort or limitations, and regular exercise means he doesn't have to scramble to get in shape when work calls.\n\nBut at the end of the day, exercise is only part of the equation.\n\n\"I stay busy, I travel a lot, and work takes precedence. But when you're busy, diet is, I think, even more important,\" Hudson said. \"You can work out all you want, but if you aren't in control of your diet, your eating habits, you're going to have a problem.\"\n\nHudson has long been serious about his workouts.\n\nIn 2024, he told Men's Health that he goes for a brisk walk whenever he can't fit in a formal workout and practices Pilates weekly to maintain his mobility.\n\n\"Ever since I was a kid, I've always made a point of being able to touch my toes,\" Hudson said. \"So at some point during the day, every day, I'll do a stretch to make sure I can still touch my toes.\"\n\nDuring a January appearance on the \"Today\" show, the actor said he fits in sets of pushups throughout his day.\n\n\"When I get up, I like to do a set of pushups first thing and throughout the day,\" he said. \"By the end of the day, I should have at least 100 pushups.\"",

    "fullText": "PARIS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - French aerospace group Safran forecast increased revenue and earnings for 2026 on Friday, after boosting profitability last year on the back of strong aftermarket demand for its civil jet engines.\n\nSafran, which co-produces engines for Airbus and Boeing jets with GE Aerospace under their CFM venture, projected 6.1 billion to 6.2 billion euros ($7.2 billion to $7.4 billion) in recurring operating profit for this calendar year.\n\nThat was on an estimated percentage rise in revenue in the \"low to mid teens\" over the period. A French version of its earnings release specified this as an increase of 12% to 15%.\n\nFor 2025, Safran posted a 26% rise in recurring operating income on an adjusted basis to 5.2 billion euros, with a margin gain of 1.5 percentage points to 16.6%.\n\nAdjusted revenue rose 15% to 31.33 billion euros as the company also generated 3.92 billion euros in free cashflow.\n\nAnalysts on average expected total recurring operating income of 5.22 billion euros on revenue of 31.49 billion euros and free cashflow of 3.66 billion euros, according to a company-compiled consensus.\n\nServices revenue for civil engines increased by 30% in U.S. dollar terms, Safran said.\n\nDemand for air travel and continued interest in flying older jets amid delays in new production buoyed aftermarket sales.\n\nThe company noted positive momentum in defence due in part to new orders for the Rafale fighter, for which it makes engines.\n\nSafran upgraded its financial targets for 2028, raising a forecast for recurring operating income to 7.0 billion to 7.5 billion euros, from the 6.0 billion to 6.5 billion euros it projected at an investor day in 2024.",

Those players are: Matt Milano (11M), Joey Bosa (7.2M), Connor McGovern (4.8M), AJ Epenesa (2.9M), and DaQuan Jones (3.7M).\n\nDue to cap hit and the need to free up money, the front office and coaching staff may also soon examine what to do or rework in the contracts like those of Curtis Samuel, Dawson Knox, Ty Johnson, Taron Johnson, and Tyler Bass.\n\nIn the meantime, per the NFL transaction wire, Buffalo also made their first signings of the offseason, inking QB Shane Buechele and WR Jalen Virgil on free agent contracts. As neither player was currently under contract to any other team, they were free to sign with any club before the March 11 league year begins.\n\nWith a new coaching staff and coordinators in all three phases, there may be some additional personnel changes on defense as well, with new DC Jim Leonard's 3-4 concepts, in particular. This is another area the team may look at.\n\nWith new Bills DC Jim Leonhard likely to implement some 3-4 principles, here's a look at the salary cap impact of moving top-paid defenders through cuts and trades should the new staff feel that is necessary.\n\nSome contracts are more tradable than I would've thought. https://t.co/QnZzAzrssE pic.twitter.com/KmQh1QNoYZ\n\n— Nick Veronica (@NickVeronica) February 9, 2026\n\nSome other important dates coming up this offseason will include the February 17th-March 3rd window to use franchise tags, the February 23rd-March 2nd NFL Combine, the March 9th-11th beginning of the \"legal tampering\" window in free agency, the March 11th 4 PM beginning of free agency, and the April 23rd-25th NFL Draft.\n\nGM and President of Football Operations Brandon Beane and company will get to work on improving and strengthening the roster, which may also include more focus on doing so via trade(s) and the Draft, as the free agent market is notably a shallower talent pool this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bills Wire: NFL AFC Buffalo Bills Football Josh Allen Brandon Beane offseason",

    "description": "What if the greatest players in Detroit Lions history lined up together in their prime? Stafford under center, Sanders in the backfield, Megatron outside and Sewell in the trenches — this is the ultimate all-time Lions offense, built across generations.",
    "fullText": "Have you ever wondered what the greatest Detroit Lions team ever assembled would look like?\n\nImagine Matthew Stafford dropping back behind an elite offensive line, handing the ball off to Barry Sanders or Jahmyr Gibbs, and throwing to Calvin Johnson and Amon-Ra St. Brown. It is a blend of eras — championship grit from the 1950s, star power from the 1990s and record-breaking production from today.\n\nThis is Part I of a two-part series constructing the greatest Lions team of all time. We begin with the offense.\n\nDespite never winning a playoff game in Detroit, Stafford stands as the greatest quarterback in franchise history.\n\nStafford’s résumé extends beyond his Lions tenure. A Super Bowl champion and league MVP, he ranks eighth all-time in passing yards and seventh in passing touchdowns. His arm talent, toughness and late-game heroics defined an era of Lions football. While Jared Goff delivered playoff victories and a Super Bowl appearance, Stafford’s career production and hardware ultimately give him the edge.\n\nAt his peak, Stafford was capable of carrying an offense. In an all-time lineup loaded with weapons, his skill set would flourish even more.\n\nRunning Backs: Barry Sanders and Jahmyr Gibbs\n\nRather than stacking the field with three wide receivers, this all-time offense leans into Detroit’s historic strength — dynamic running backs.\n\nBarry Sanders is a lock. Sanders ranks fourth all-time in rushing yards despite playing only nine seasons. He never rushed for fewer than 1,300 yards in a season and remains widely regarded as the greatest running back in NFL history. His vision, balance and elusiveness are unmatched.\n\nPairing Sanders with Jahmyr Gibbs creates a nightmare for defenses. Gibbs, still early in his career, has already established himself as one of the league’s most explosive offensive players. He broke Sanders’ franchise record for most touchdowns before turning 24, reaching 48 total touchdowns. Though he has yet to earn First-Team All-Pro honors, his trajectory suggests it is only a matter of time.\n\nTogether, Sanders and Gibbs would form one of the most electrifying backfields imaginable.\n\nWide Receivers: Calvin Johnson and Amon-Ra St. Brown\n\nFew franchises can match the star power of this duo.\n\nCalvin Johnson, known simply as “Megatron,” was a true unicorn. He recorded 329 receiving yards in a single game, the second-most in NFL history, and set the single-season receiving yardage record with 1,964 yards in 2012, surpassing Jerry Rice. Johnson led the league in receiving yards twice and earned three First-Team All-Pro selections. His size, speed and red-zone dominance made him nearly unguardable.\n\nOn the opposite side is Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has been one of the most productive receivers in football over the past three seasons, including playoffs:\n\n• 4,590 receiving yards (second in the NFL)\n\n• 34 receiving touchdowns (first)\n\nSt. Brown has earned two First-Team All-Pro honors and one Second-Team selection, cementing himself among the league’s elite. His route running, toughness and reliability would complement Johnson’s vertical dominance perfectly.\n\nCharlie Sanders remains the gold standard at tight end in franchise history.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1977, Sanders earned seven Pro Bowl selections and three First-Team All-Pro honors. A Pro Football Hall of Famer, he totaled 336 receptions for 4,817 yards and 31 touchdowns. In an era not known for pass-heavy offenses, Sanders was one of the first truly dynamic receiving tight ends.\n\nHis presence would add versatility and balance to this all-time offense.\n\nOffensive Line: Lou Creekmur, John Gordy, Frank Ragnow, Larry Glover, Penei Sewell\n\nChampionship offenses begin in the trenches, and this group blends historic greatness with modern dominance. Combined, these five linemen account for 16 All-Pro selections and 22 Pro Bowl appearances.\n\nLou Creekmur anchors the unit. A six-time First-Team All-Pro and eight-time Pro Bowler, he was a cornerstone of Detroit’s 1950s championship teams and is widely considered the greatest offensive lineman in franchise history.\n\nJohn Gordy, a four-time First-Team All-Pro and six-time Pro Bowler, was a dominant guard during the Lions’ last championship era. His consistency and accolades cement his legacy.\n\nFrank Ragnow brings modern excellence to the center position. A four-time Pro Bowler and three-time Second-Team All-Pro, he has been one of the league’s top centers during the Dan Campbell era.\n\nLarry Glover, a three-time Pro Bowler, provides steady veteran presence from the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThen there is Penei Sewell. A four-time Pro Bowler and three-time First-Team All-Pro from 2023 to 2025, Sewell has emerged as one of the NFL’s premier tackles. Still early in his career, he is already on a Hall of Fame trajectory.\n\nThis all-time Lions offense blends eras, styles and philosophies. It has explosiveness in the backfield, dominance on the outside and power in the trenches.\n\nIn Part II, we will assemble the defense — and see if it can match the firepower of this historic offense.",

    "fullText": "New York Jets fans have come to terms with the fact that Sam Darnold was better off elsewhere. The former No. 3 overall selection has done a fantastic job reviving his career since leaving the Jets. All of Darnold's hard work culminated in winning Super Bowl LX with the Seattle Seahawks this past weekend.\n\nDarnold has kept it classy at every turn when discussing his tumultuous tenure with the Jets during Super Bowl media week. The Seahawks held their Super Bowl 60-winning parade in downtown Seattle on Wednesday. As per usual, Darnold was faced with occasional questions about the Jets in the wake of winning his first Lombardi Trophy.\n\nOne particular question and clip has rightfully gone viral. Justin Fried of The Jet Press asked Darnold if he had a message to Jets fans who have continued to support him despite things not working out between player and franchise. Darnold provided the most heartwarming response imaginable.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Darnold started with. “I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise. The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.”\n\nCongratulations to Darnold on winning Super Bowl LX!\n\nI asked Sam Darnold if he had a message to #Jets fans who have continued to support him:\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“I always look at myself and feel like I could’ve done a lot more for that franchise.”\n\n“The fact that [Jets fans] are able to support me even through that means a lot.” pic.twitter.com/AtOsbghHJN\n\n— Justin Fried (@JustinTFried) February 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Sam Darnold had the most heartwarming message for Jets fans",

    "description": "The second-place finish in this year's women's halfpipe finals may wind up meaning more to Kim than her past golds.",
    "fullText": "Chloe Kim celebrates her second place in the women's halfpipe snowboarding final with the American flag at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics in Livigno, Italy, on February 12, 2026. Credit - Oliver Weiken—picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nYou’d be forgiven for disbelieving the smile on Chloe Kim’s face Thursday night in Livigno, Italy, after she finished with a silver medal in the women’s Olympic halfpipe snowboarding finals. Kim’s victories at the Olympics are typically inevitable. And after she finished first in qualifying earlier in the week, it seemed she had shaken the effects of the dislocated left shoulder she suffered back in early January. Winners refuse to accept second place, right?\n\nBut upon further review, Kim’s jubilant reception of the silver medal at the Milano Cortina Games made all kinds of sense. In fact, this hardware may wind up meaning more to her than the golds she took home from PyeongChang in 2018 and Beijing four years ago.\n\n“Absolutely,” says Kim. “I mean, a month ago, I wasn’t even sure if I would be here. I could get emotional thinking about it. I really worked hard to get here. So this metal means so much.”\n\nFollowing the competition, she walked down a snowy hill at the Livigno Snow Park halfpipe venue, hand-in-hand with her boyfriend, Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns, the NFL’s reigning defensive player of the year, who stood with Kim’s family and friends at the bottom of the halfpipe, snapping photos of Kim in action. “Exciting but terrifying,” Garrett said, about watching Kim contort her body in the air on a snowboard.\n\nShe’s got reason to be happy, personally and professionally. The new Olympic gold medalist, Goan Choi of South Korea, is now the youngest Olympic snowboard gold medalist, at 17 years, 101 days. Kim, who was also 17 when she won Olympic gold in PyeongChang, has become a mentor for Choi. If Kim walks away from snowboarding—“I’m aware that I can’t do this forever,” she says—she’d leave the sport in good hands.\n\n“She's my baby. I've known her since she was so little, and I'm so proud of her,” says Kim. “It means so much to me to know that I've inspired a whole new generation.”\n\nThe night began in typical Chloe Kim fashion. Seven of the 12 finalists fell in their first run in snowy conditions, which made landing tricks more of a challenge. But Kim made no such mistakes, and her run was visibly superior, even through the snowfall. Her score, at 88.00, led the competition.\n\nEach Olympic halfpipe finalist gets three runs, with the highest score the only one that counts. Could anyone surpass Kim in the final two runs? It had never happened before in the Games.\n\nKim had even held back in her first run. “I'll admit, I went pretty safe on it,” she says. “Didn't go as big as I was in practice, mainly because I was watching all these girls take slams, and I was like, let's just get to the bottom.”\n\nEntering her second run, Kim still held the lead. She tried to stretch her limits. “I wanted to try something I'd never done before,” says Kim. “I wanted to make history.” She fell.\n\nChoi had a scary-looking accident in her first run; she remained in the middle of the halfpipe for a few minutes while receiving medical attention, but was able to ride to the bottom of her own accord. Choi thought about dropping out of the event.\n\nInstead, she stunned the Livigno Snow Park by scoring a 90.25 on her final run, upping the evening’s ante. For the first time at the Olympics, Kim trailed. So she’d have to come through in the evening’s final attempt. “My coach said, you know, you could do your first run better, or you can go for it,” says Kim. “I wanted to go for it. Because that's what I do.”\n\nShe fell again, allowing Choi to claim the gold. “The snow really started to come down, the wall started to get a little sticky,” says Kim. “No excuses here. I should have made that mental note when I dropped in and felt it on my first hit. Yeah, I couldn't come through. But all good.”\n\nKim made a beeline for Choi to congratulate her. “She took a heavy slam, got back up and won the damn thing,” says Kim. “That is badass.” Choi is not only the youngest Olympic snowboarding champion: she’s also the youngest X-Games halfpipe titleist ever, winning the event in 2023 and unseating Kim for that distinction as well.\n\nKim fell short in her bid to be the first snowboarder to win three straight Olympic golds. “I don't know if there really was a weight on my shoulders,” she says. “I feel like every time I go into a competition, it's always like, ‘Oh, she can make history here. She could do this. She could do that.’ I'm just here to snowboard and whatever medal I get in doing so, great.”\n\nOn Kim’s itinerary upon her U.S. reentry: shoulder surgery. “I’m excited for it to not be popping out all the time,” she says. Kim believes the injury cost her the key pre-Games training time needed to execute a flawless plan.\n\nNot that she’s at all bummed about it.  “In my eyes, I’m a winner,” says Kim. “Because I was able to persevere and fight through.”\n\nWrite to Sean Gregory at sean.gregory@time.com.",

    "description": "Several miles off the coast of Turnberry, Scotland, sits a barren island whose precious granite plays a key role in the Winter Olympics.",
    "fullText": "The original golf course at Trump Turnberry, on Scotland’s southwest coast, has some years on it: 125 to be exact. But that’s nothing compared to the age of one of the course’s famous neighbors: the uninhabited volcanic plug that stands sentinel in the Firth of Clyde about 10 miles off Turnberry’s shoreline.\n\nThe origins of that wind-battered granite dome, which rises more than 11 stories out of the sea and is visible from nearly every hole on Turnberry’s Aisla course, have been traced back 600 million years, to those lonely days when the continents were barren and the only signs of life came in the form of bacteria and eukaryotes.\n\nAnyone who’s played at Turnberry — or, for that matter, Royal Troon or Prestwick, about 25 miles up the coast — will be familiar with the island for the magnificent backdrop it provides. Same goes for golf-watchers who’ve tuned into any of the four Open Championships that have been conducted on the Aisla course since 1977, most recently in 2009 when Tom Watson nearly claimed the Claret Jug at 59 years young.\n\nThe Aisla Craig featured prominently in all of those broadcasts, just as Torrey Pines’ hang-gliders or Pebble Beach’s harbor seals do when the PGA Tour visits those storied venues. The rock is a staple of the Turnberry experience: an eroded magmatic pluton that not only inspires awe but also just so happens to play an essential role every four years in the Winter Olympic Games.\n\n***\n\nRicky English isn’t much of a golfer. “I’ve tried it before, it’s quite hard,” he told me earlier this week in a Scottish accent thicker than a pint of Belhaven Black. “It’s one of those games where one hole you can play like Seve Ballesteros, and then the next hole it’s in the woods and you’ve lost your ball.”\n\nBesides, English spends most of his days thinking about another sport: curling. If you’re even just a casual Olympics viewer — perhaps you’ve been following the action in Milan over the past week — you’re surely familiar with the pursuit, which has been awarding Olympic medals since the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. Curling, in the most basic terms, involves a “thrower” pushing a roughly 40-pound stone down a 150-foot-long sheet of ice, with the aim of stopping the stone as close as possible to the center of a target (aka “the house”) on the far end of the ice. Aiding in the process are two of the thrower’s teammates who flank the stone as it slides down the ice, using “brooms”, as needed, to reduce the ice’s friction.\n\nEnglish knows a thing or two about those stones because he oversees the process of making them, as the operations manager of Kays Scotland, which since 2006 has been the exclusive manufacturer of curling stones for the Olympics. “We’re kind of servicing the whole sport,” English said of his small but mighty factory about a 45-minute drive north of Turnberry. “There’s only about 50 workers in here. We’re really busy.”\n\nIt likely will come as no surprise from where Kays harvests its materials for the stones: yes, Aisla Craig her good self.\n\nThe island’s Blue Hone granite is used on the stone’s running edge while its Common Green granite, which is resistant to heat transfer and splintering, composes the body of the stone. It’s a formula Kays has spent the last 175 or so years perfecting, with granite that can be found nowhere else on earth. The factory, which is open four days a week, manufacturers about 12 stones a day or 48 per week with a sticker price of approximately $1,000/per (shipping not included). That might sound steep, but when you consider most stones last about 30 years, the cost also might sound like a bargain.\n\n“We have to keep our own quality standards up for every stone,” English said. “Whether we make a stone for the Olympics or we make a stone for a [curling] club in Alabama, it’s the same quality control, the exact same way of making it goes into it. There’s no difference.”\n\nKays ships stones all over the world, from the U.S. to China, Japan and South Korea to Mongolia and New Zealand, even to . . . Antarctica. “They’re using it as a kind of luxury experience type thing,” English said. “It’s like minus-36 degrees, so I wasn’t sure with the temperature and the conditions how the stones would be, but they seemed to be fine.”\n\nWhile the Aisla Craig’s granite is uniquely suited for curling stones, it also has found its way into Turnberry’s golf shop in the form of ball markers and other granite-based memorabilia. Kays also commissioned a St. Andrews clubmaker to build four hickory golf clubs into which Kays incorporated Common Green granite into the bases. They sold quickly. “So, yes,” English said of his team’s handiwork, “there’s wee ties to golf.”\n\nEnglish said he also sees some crossover between the skills required in both curling and golf, and, indeed, it’s not hard to see the parallels between sliding a stone down a slab of ice and rolling a ball across a slick green. “There are a few curlers that we know of that are actually really good golfers,” he said. “They’ve got the type of skills from curling, with the touch and feel, and they kind of took that into golf.”\n\nBut English has little time to work on his own swing or stroke. He has emails to answer and orders to fill, especially in this busy window during which his stones are enjoying their every-four-years moment in the international spotlight. To capitalize on the publicity, Kays’ online shop has been selling Olympics-themed giftware (coasters, drink cubes) made from Aisla Craig granite. The majority of orders thus far have come from the U.S., and English suspects that’s at least partly due to a certain rap legend on NBC’s coverage team in Milan.\n\n“Snoop Dog was at the curling,” English said. “That might have helped.”\n\nSix-hundred million years of history doesn’t hurt, either.\n\nThe post This iconic golf backdrop plays essential Winter Olympics role appeared first on Golf.",

    "description": "Manfred said there are still issues to resolve with the Major League Baseball Players Association before those Olympic aspirations are a reality.",
    "fullText": "PALM BEACH, Fla. — Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred is optimistic that major leaguers will play in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nManfred, speaking following an owners meeting Thursday, said there are still issues to resolve with the Major League Baseball Players Association before those Olympic aspirations are a reality, but “I think we’re a lot closer to there than we were the last time we talked about it,” he said.\n\nThe six-nation baseball tournament will be played from July 13-19 at Dodger Stadium. MLB is planning for an extended All-Star break between July 9 and July 21, with the All-Star Game likely at San Francisco on July 11.\n\nAn agreement with the union is needed.\n\n“I sense a lot of momentum towards playing in LA in 2028,” Manfred said. “I think we are going to get over those issues. I think people have come to appreciate that the Olympics on U.S. soil is a unique marketing opportunity for the game. I think we had a lot of players interested in doing it and, you know, I feel pretty good about the idea (that) we’ll get there.”\n\nIn addition, an agreement is needed on insurance to cover player contracts for time with Olympic teams.\n\nThe United States will have an automatic berth in the both the baseball and softball tournaments and the top two other nations from the Americas in next month’s World Baseball Classic will earn berths.\n\nMLB did not allow players on 40-man rosters to participate in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, when Nippon Professional Baseball interrupted its season and Japan beat the U.S. 2-0 in the gold medal game.\n\nManfred was also asked if the involvement of Casey Wasserman, the prominent businessman and talent agent who has recently lost clients because of his appearance in recently released government files on Jeffrey Epstein, would deter the league from participating in the Olympics. He declined to comment on Wasserman, who is the chairman of the Los Angeles games, saying, “Look, our dealings are not with Casey. Our dealings are with the institution of the Olympics.”\n\nThe addition of star outfielder Kyle Tucker by the Los Angeles Dodgers to what already was among the highest payrolls again sparked debate over whether management will propose a salary cap in collective bargaining this year.\n\nManfred said there hasn’t been much movement in salary cap talks.\n\nTucker, the right fielder who is considered one of the best players in baseball, is the latest accomplished veteran brought in by the Dodgers, who have three of the top eight current contracts by average annual value. Los Angeles also signed top closer Edwin Díaz to bolster its bullpen.\n\n“Look, I think great teams are always good for baseball,” he said. “I think with respect to this particular great team, it added to what we have been hearing from fans in a lot of markets for a long time about the competitiveness of the game. But great teams are always good baseball.”\n\nBargaining is likely to start this spring on a labor contract to succeed the deal that expires Dec. 1.\n\n“We’re in the preparation process,” Manfred said. “We haven’t agreed on a calendar with the MLBPA and it does take two to tango, as they say, but historically after opening day we kind of get started.”\n\nManfred said there likely isn’t a way around insurance issues that have come up for MLB-contracted players planning to play in next month’s World Baseball Classic. Several stars, including Puerto Rico’s Francisco Lindor and Carlos Correa, were left off their countries’ rosters because the WBC insurer wouldn’t cover them.\n\n“We like that, when they say they want to play, obviously,” Manfred said. “But then to have a problem with the insurance and the guy being unable to play, we recognize that. I’m just not sure that there is a way around it.”\n\nThe tournament is co-owned by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association. Insurance is provided by National Financial Partners.\n\n“In order to get clubs comfortable with the idea that guys should play earlier in games they otherwise would not play, we had to protect them financially,” Manfred said.\n\nOwners approved a rules change requiring first- and third-base coaches to remain in the marked coaching boxes. Coaches have frequently moved toward home plate, in a better position to better relay signs from the defensive team that may pick up.\n\nMLB will produce and distribute local television broadcasts of at least 14 teams this season following financial problems of Main Street Sports Group’s FanDuel Sports Network.\n\n“The RSN situation has an impact on our revenue growth because the decline there is a drag on what is otherwise a growing industry,” Manfred said. “It is true that the smaller markets have been hit harder than the larger markets, which impacts revenue sharing. Having said both of those, I think longer term, our content is inherently valuable. We deliver tons of eyeballs, and I think when we have an opportunity to get to market in 2028, we’re going to be just fine.”\n\nManfred said the 14 teams are “probably making a little less than they made under their old contracts.”\n\n“The key word there is old,” he added. “The reason those contracts aren’t there anymore was they were not economic given the cord-cutting that’s going on.”\n\nTeams approved two changes in controlling owners: Cincinnati Reds CEO Phil Castellini succeeds his father Minnesota Twins board member Tom Pohlad takes over from takes over from his younger brother Bob.\n\nManfred said of the San Diego Padres’ sale process: “There is robust interest in what is viewed as a really appealing asset.”\n\nMilwaukee chairman Mark Attanasio and Baltimore control owner David Rubenstein were voted to the eight-man executive council, replacing Arizona managing general partner Ken Kendrick and Seattle chairman John Stanton. The council also includes San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson and Cleveland chairman Paul Dolan (whose terms expire in 2027) and Miami chairman Bruce Sherman and Los Angeles Angels owner Arte Moreno (2028) and New York Mets chairman Steve Cohen and Athletics managing partner John Fisher (2029).\n\nMLB approved extensions of its contract with Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. and of the deals for Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. to carry the Extra Innings package of out-of-market TV broadcasts.",

    "fullText": "The American women’s ski team have provided some extremely compelling stories at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milan/Cortina d’Ampezzo. From the serious injury to Lindsey Vonn to the unexpected gold medal by Breezy Johnson, you might not have heard of the remarkable story of American alpine skier Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon.\n\nAccording to Travis Pittman of the Central Oregon Daily, Wiles survived a plane crash seven months ago in Sisters, Oregon. At the time, Wiles was a passenger on a training flight when the plane dovetailed.\n\nWiles credits her boyfriend Maxime Boutemy of saving her life. Maxime helped Wiles out of the wreckage before the plane went into flames. Wiles’s symptoms were a concussion and burns.\n\nBefore the accident occurred, Wiles had dreams of being a pilot. It will be interesting to see if those dreams still exist, or if Wiles will concentrate now fully on skiing.\n\nHeading into the 2026 Olympic Winter Games, Wiles had won four World Cup downhill medals in alpine skiing, with a lot of success on the Olympic course. She had won a bronze medal at Cortina in 2018, and silver medal in Cortina in 2024.\n\nWiles’s other two World Cup medals were bronze medals in Zauchensee, Austria. The first came in 2017, and the second came last month.\n\nWiles won her Olympic bronze medal with Paula Moltzan of Minneapolis, Minnesota on Tuesday. They had a time of 2:21.91, and beat Mikaela Shiffrin and Johnson by six one hundredths of a second to reach the podium in the women’s team combined competition.

    "fullText": "MILAN - Brady Tkachuk tried to put into words what he had just experienced.\n\nThe Americans had just come off the ice at Milano Santagiulia Hockey Arena, where festive and loud fans ensured a fabulous atmosphere for the match against Latvia. Brady Tkachuk had the first goal, set up by his brother, Matthew, en route to a 5-1 victory over Latvia on Thursday, Feb. 12 in the preliminary round of the 2026 Winter Olympics men's hockey tournament.\n\n\"It was amazing, and it was great to see the flags, the chants, and just the support that you have here,\" Brady Tkachuk said. \"Just a little example of the support you have back at home. You're playing in front of millions of Americans, and you just want to represent them well, and it's always an honor to put this jersey on.\"\n\nMore: U.S. men's hockey team ready to play after soaking up Olympic life\n\nThe ice received so-so reviews.\n\n\"I honestly didn't think it was that bad,\" defenseman Charlie McAvoy said. \"I mean, you certainly notice it when it gets later in the period. I had a pretty solid toe pick in the third up top where I had to test my balance pretty good. There are some times where you're like digging in, getting stuck a little. But both teams have to play on the same ice, so you make do.\"\n\nOne of biggest pluses to come out of the game for the Americans may have been the second goal they had overturned. That was a lesson in the zero tolerance policy of international hockey when it comes to making contact with a goaltender in the crease.\n\n\"I don't know that I agreed with the call, but it doesn't matter what I think,\" coach Mike Sullivan said.\n\nThe Latvians also successfully challenged Brock Nelson was offside when Quinn Hughes put the puck in the net shortly after Tkachuk's goal. Latvia tied the game after the overturned goal. It could have been a tough stretch, but the Americans didn't falter.\n\n\"The energy on the bench is terrific,\" Sullivan said. \"They never got deflated. They just, the self-talk and the talk amongst themselves about just staying with it and keep playing, that, we're going to be fine. And, of course, we were. But those types of moments, they can be game-changing moments.\"\n\nLatvia never really posed a threat, even after making it 1-1. In the second period, shots favored the Americans, 17-2.\n\n\"I thought it was a hell of a first, but a couple of goals called back, and then it's just 1-1, but there's never any panic,\" Matthew Tkachuk said. \"The second period on, we just wanted to make sure somebody was out of the net at all times. They were playing pretty tight. The skill and possession and strength that we have, we knew we were going to win some battles, but somebody had to be at the net, so we tried to make it harder on the goalie. We tried to make him haul us down.\"\n\nBrock Nelson scored twice in the second period, nestled around a goal by Tage Thompson. Nelson's second goal was off tic-tac-toe passing from Jack Hughes.\n\nEverything coming up BROCK. NELSON. #WinterOlympics pic.twitter.com/yy7xGkXiR0\n\n— NBC Olympics & Paralympics (@NBCOlympics) February 12, 2026\n\n\"I was skating up the ice with Jack, a little bit of 2-on-1,\" Nelson said. \"I just tried to give him a little bit more time and try to drive the back post. I peeled out, saw him make a drop pass and another guy come in and I thought maybe one of those guys was going to rip a one-timer, so I just kind of looped around. And then a couple great passes and poise by those guys. I find myself on the back side with space and an open net.\"\n\nAfter Auston Matthews scored in the third period, the Americans eased off a bit. It was, all in all, an excellent first outing for them.\n\n\"I mean, just an unbelievable experience,\" Nelson said. \"I tried to soak it all in. I thought our line was good and made a lot of great plays, good chances, good support and a good team win overall to get it going.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Detroit Free Press: USA adjusts after disallowed goals to beat Latvia: 'Never any panic'",

    "fullText": "Things are looking up if you’re a fan of the Las Vegas Raiders. New head coach Klint Kubiak is coming off a Super Bowl win as an offensive coordinator/playcaller. Now he’ll take over the Raiders, where he’ll still be calling plays. But now everyone wants to know if the Maxx Crosby trade rumors are legitimate.\n\nAccording to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, the meeting Kubiak had with Crosby was a “positive” one. However, that doesn’t mean things are peachy in Vegas between the Raiders and their second-team All-Pro pass-rusher. Crosby is now weighing a decision of whether he wants to request a trade, but the Raiders still have a chance to salvage this.\n\n“My understanding is that conversation with Klint Kubiak was positive. But there are a lot of other fences that would need to be mended for Crosby to stay in Las Vegas. It is not an impossibility that Crosby is back with the Raiders. It is certainly a possibility that he is not. There are multiple voices here, including Maxx and Klint Kubiak, all the way up to Mark Davis, who are going to be a part of this decision.”\n\nNFL Network’s Tom Pelissero on Maxx Crosby\n\nWe can’t blame Crosby, who’s easily one of the NFL’s best defenders, for wanting to be a part of a winner. He’s played in one postseason game since he arrived as a fourth-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, yet he’s made five Pro Bowl teams in that span.\n\nIn other words, Crosby is far from the reason why the Raiders have been so bad. Now he may want to be part of why a team is so good, and possibly even compete for a Super Bowl ring.\n\nThere’s no telling how long that may take with the new-look Raiders, but Crosby may feel like he’s been waiting this one out long enough. If so, several teams will be in a rush to present their best blockbuster trade offer for the sack master.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders Hire Former NFL Head Coach for Klint Kubiak’s Staff\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers Named ‘Interesting’ Landing Spot for All-Pro Weapon\n\nNew York Giants Connected to Pro Bowl Tight End to Help Jaxson Dart",

Busch qualified on pole on Wednesday with a speed of 183.651. The streak wasn't on Busch's mind following the run, though.\n\n\"Being able to qualify on my first pole for the Daytona 500, that’s pretty special,” Busch told NASCAR.com on Wednesday. “This feels good. Feels really good for RCR as a group.\"\n\nBusch will make his 21st start in the Daytona 500 on Sunday. Despite winning two NASCAR Cup Series titles, 63 race victories, and countless other accolades, it's been 20 years of trying and 20 years of frustration for Busch in the sport's biggest race.\n\nChase Briscoe's 4th-place run in 2025 is the best finish for a Daytona 500 pole winner during the streak. Briscoe will start alongside Busch on the front row in Sunday's race.\n\nDrivers have won the Daytona 500 from the pole nine times, including Richard Petty (1966), Bill Elliott (1985, 1987), and Jeff Gordon (1999).\n\nBusch says his lack of a Daytona 500 victory is part of what motivates him to continue racing.\n\n\"[It's] obviously another driving factor to that, wanting to come out here,\" Busch said ahead of his qualifying run. \"We only get a chance to do that once a year to try to win that race.\"\n\nThough he's been in the sport for over two decades now, Busch says he has no plans to retire and still wants to win races.\n\nThe remainder of the Daytona 500 field will be set in Thursday's Daytona Duel races. The Daytona 500 is Sunday at 2:30 p.m.",

With the NFL Combine a couple of weeks away, you can expect deals to be made behind closed doors in Indianapolis.\n\nOne of the hottest names expected to be on the market is Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray. The former first-overall pick appears to be on the outside looking in after being benched in 2025 and Arizona hiring a new head coach.\n\nMORE: Las Vegas Raiders snatch up former Chargers, Titans head coach to staff\n\nA lot can change between now and the new league year, but the Cardinals are reportedly beginning to explore trade options. There will be challenges with his contract this year, however.\n\n\"A change of scenery is best for all parties involved.\"@FieldYates weighs in on Kyler Murray's future with the Cardinals\n\n— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) February 12, 2026\n\nAfter 2026, Murray’s contract will have no more guarantees. However, a trading party takes on $34M this season in salary–unless Arizona takes on some of that salary.\n\nThen there is also the idea of compensation. That $34M figure will likely influence trade compensation. If the Cardinals were to eat some of that money, it could reasonably be expected that they would get a better return in a trade.\n\nMORE: George Kittle sends message to 49ers, NFL over wild conspiracy theory\n\nThe Cardinals want to get this done quickly, as Murray’s base salary becomes guaranteed four days after the 2026 new league year date. They could potentially post-June 1 release him, but that would leave no return.\n\nMurray has been linked to multiple teams, including the Indianapolis Colts, New York Jets, and even the Cleveland Browns. The Colts are uncertain of Daniel Jones’ recovery timeline, the Jets will likely move on from Fields, and the Browns are always looking for a quarterback.\n\nOne thing feels almost certain: Murray will be in a different uniform only a few years after signing a hefty contract extension.

    "description": "The U.S. men's hockey team scored four unanswered goals, and had a few taken away, led by a pair from Brock Nelson on Thursday in Milan.",
    "fullText": "Brock Nelson might be making his Olympics debut, but he has a rich family history when it comes to playing hockey for Team USA.\n\nHis grandfather was a forward on the team that won gold in 1960. His uncle was a forward on the “Miracle on Ice” team in 1980.\n\nAnd Thursday night, Nelson made a mark of his own. The Colorado Avalanche forward scored two goals to lead the U.S. to a 5-1 victory over Latvia in an opening game that included some of the best American NHL players.\n\n“It’s pretty crazy,” said Nelson, 34, considered the old man on a team filled with some of the game’s brightest young stars. “It’s just an unbelievable experience. I’m trying to soak it all in.”\n\nThe Americans had to show resilience after two of their goals were wiped out in the first period by successful challenges. It’s rare to have two such reversals in a game, exceedingly rare to have two in the same period.\n\n“Yeah, that was frustrating,” said defenseman Zach Werenski, who plays for the Columbus Blue Jackets. “But at the same time, you’re still getting the goals even though they got overturned. You’re doing the work to put the puck in the net, and I think that helps your confidence a little bit. After they get overturned, you’ve just got to put it out of your mind and continue to play the same way.”\n\nLatvia was competitive early, forging a 1-1 tie in the first period, but eventually fell prey to a U.S. barrage. The Americans outshot Latvia, 38-18, and starter Connor Hellebuyck needed to make only 17 saves.\n\n“It was just 1-1 but there was never any panic,” said forward Matthew Tkachuk, the Florida Panthers winger. “From the second period on, we just wanted to make sure someone was at the net at all times. They were playing pretty tight, but with the skill and puck possession and strength that we have, we knew we were going to win some battles.”\n\nNelson, who said he takes a ribbing from his young teammates for his graying hair, has a rich family history when it comes to Olympic hockey. His grandfather, Bill Christian, won gold at the Games in Squaw Valley — now called Olympic Valley — and his uncle, Dave Christian, was on that championship team in Lake Placid.\n\n“My brother came in today,” said Nelson, raised in Minneapolis. “He brought me a couple pins from back home, from 'Hockeytown,' and a couple letters from the youth team. They’ve always been supportive of me, going back to growing up there. I’m forever grateful for that.”\n\nThe U.S. team features brothers Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, and Quinn and Jack Hughes — all NHL players. It has been 12 years since NHL players last took the Olympic stage.\n\n“To make this roster is extremely difficult when you look at the amount of talent that the United States has developed and can play at this level,” said coach Mike Sullivan, who doubles as coach of the New York Rangers.\n\nThe fans were fairly evenly divided, with every U-S-A chant countered with one for LAT-VI-A.\n\n“It was great to see the flags, the chants, and just the support that you have here,” said U.S. forward Brady Tkachuk, who was raised in a suburb of St. Louis and plays for the Ottawa Senators. “I'm just kind of a little example of the support you have back at home. So you're playing in front of millions of millions of Americans, and you just want to represent them well, and it’s always an honor to put this jersey on.”\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Williamsburg's swim team is writing inspiring history with its largest roster ever. Meet the individuals making it possible.",
    "fullText": "Dec. 17, 2025, was a historic night for Williamsburg High School's athletic program.\n\nDuring a swim meet at New Richmond High School, the Wildcats, whose team has grown from two athletes in 2024-2025 to 10 swimmers this year, fielded a boys relay team and girls relay team for the first time in school history.\n\n\"I never really got to be in a high school relay and having it my senior year was even more special for me. It's really going to be a core memory as long as I live,\" Taylor Sefton said.\n\nFor the majority of her career, Sefton has been one of the only swimmers on a Williamsburg team that is now rapidly growing under the supervision of her father, fourth-year coach Bill Sefton.\n\n\"They all work well together. They're a fantastic team. They all get along, nobody has any problems and they work hard. I can't ask for anything else as a coach,\" Bill said.\n\nTaylor started the 2024-2025 season alongside Cameron Karschnik, whose older brother, Jonah, was a two-time state qualifier in the 100-yard butterfly. Cameron couldn't finish the season due to a back injury, but Bill is hopeful that he'll return next season.\n\nIn the twilight of her high school career, Taylor is attempting to become just the second female swimmer at Williamsburg to qualify for the state meet. Betsy Brockman won back-to-back 200-yard individual medley state titles in 2001 and 2002, setting a previous DII state record with a time of 2:04.98 as a senior.\n\n\"It would just be another accomplishment for myself. If I can only make districts four times in a row and I end up not making state, I won't be too upset because I know the work I put in wasn't for nothing,\" Taylor said.\n\nBill keeps a time board at practice, a chart of each swimmer's best times and which strokes they will compete in at upcoming meets. In the bottom right corner of the board is the list of school records he has found. Taylor's name is listed next to five of the seven individual records; Brockman owns the other two.\n\nJunior Jarvis Zach, who owns the 50-yard freestyle school record, has one of the more interesting experiences on the team. Before this school year, he emigrated from Germany to live with his grandma and is waiting for his parents to get an approved visa so they can move to the United States. His mother was a swimming teacher and encouraged him to try the sport.\n\nMoving to the United States, he immediately noticed differences in the practice and meet structure from his homeland, where sports are more club-oriented, as opposed to high school competition.\n\n\"I did swimming once in Germany, but it was for maybe two weeks and I really enjoyed it. Also in my free time, I swim a lot so I decided to join the swim team. I heard that it was starting new so I wanted to see how it was,\" Zach said.\n\nIn joining the swim team, Zach hopes to recruit others to continue to grow the program.\n\nCarter Conatser joined halfway through this season after recovering from a football injury. He runs track in the spring and was looking for a way to keep his conditioning up.\n\n\"By the time track would come around, I'd die for the first three or four weeks doing conditioning,\" Conatser said. \"I love this sport. It's the perfect sport to get into shape and feel loose by the time spring comes around.\"\n\nAs first-year swimmers on a team with seven freshmen, Zach and Conatser are quickly learning that, despite their inexperience, they need to be leaders for their younger counterparts.\n\n\"Being an upperclassman and at the same time learning a completely new sport is a very tough thing to do. Trying to encourage others to do their best while also trying to get up to where their level is has definitely been an adjustment,\" Conatser said.\n\nOn a team where everyone is teaching each other new skills, freshman Mallory Murphy stands out. She showed up on the first day of practice with all the confidence in the world but was quickly humbled when she discovered that she didn't know how to swim.\n\n\"I was flailing in the water. I would swim and I wasn't moving. I would basically be standing still in the water but I kept going because everybody was like, 'You're doing good. You're growing.' All my teammates were always there for me. They didn't let me get upset about not doing good. So I just kept trying and I never gave up,\" Murphy said.\n\nSaid Bill, \"She comes to practice every day and completes all her sets. We couldn't be more proud of all the kids on the team.\"\n\nFilling out the freshman class is Norah Bates, Owen Bickett, Landon Johnson, Sophia Lincoln, Jakob Karajic and Marley Minning. According to Sefton's research, Johnson already owns the 100-yard breaststroke school record.\n\n\"It's my first year swimming and I will say the community here is great - the whole swim community, not just our team,\" Lincoln said.\n\nThen there's eighth-grader Bailey Sefton, who can't yet swim on varsity but Bill believes she will break Taylor's records, and even some of Brockman's over the next four years.\n\nBill anticipates adding three total swimmers next year.\n\n\"Hopefully next season, we start off with water acclimation and my group that's already been doing it, they in turn teach the other kids that are coming into the program,\" Bill said.\n\nThe Wildcats instantly set school records in the 200-yard medley relay and 200-yard freestyle relay, and Sefton hopes to have enough swimmers in 2026-2027 to field a 400-yard freestyle relay team, but this season has been about so much more than the times.\n\nAt the start of the season, the majority of the team was warming up with just swimming one lap of freestyle. Now, they start practice with a 500-yard warm-up before focusing on different strokes.\n\nThe amount of behind-the-scenes work hasn't gone unnoticed either. Assistant coach Logan Minning is a teacher at Williamsburg and the mother of freshman Marley Minning. Being at the school during the day allows her to communicate with athletic director Jason Moberly, the athletes and parents while Sefton works as a firefighter and Emergency Medical Technician.\n\n\"She's been a huge help for me. I'm so thankful to have her as part of the team,\" Bill said.\n\nWilliamsburg is building a new multi-purpose athletic center, but it doesn't have a pool, so the team practices at the Clermont Family YMCA in Batavia. The Ohio High School Athletic Association allows high school teams to practice for 90 minutes a day and the staff at the Y allows the Wildcats to use the pool whenever they need it.\n\n\"They've been great. They're awesome, letting us practice whenever we want. I give them the majority of the credit because we couldn't have made it happen without them,\" Bill said.\n\nA few team members will even take jobs as lifeguards, helping to further advance their aquatic pedigree.\n\nWilliamsburg's team seemingly came out of nowhere this year, but it has been a work in progress from day one. This team isn't one large story, it's a collection of individual triumphs, adding to the school's distinguished athletic history.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Williamsburg High School swim team grows, inspires, breaks records",

Michigan State is projected to play Bentley in the first round, who is the lowest ranked team currently slated to make the field. The other matchup in the Spartans' region is No. 2 seed Cornell vs. No. 3 seed Denver -- which would pit a team who knocked out the Spartans in last year's tournament against a team that would have a relative home ice advantage.\n\nMichigan State recently took over as the No. 1 team in the NPI rankings -- which are used to seed and field the 16 teams that'll make the NCAA Tournament. In gaining the overall No. 1 seed, Michigan State would be in line for a notably easier matchup than if they were lower in the seeding lines.\n\nMichigan State sits at 22-6-0 overall and 13-5-0 in Big Ten play with six regular season games remaining.

    "description": "The Detroit Lions blocked the Dolphins’ request to interview Bruce Gradkowski — denying help to new Miami head coach and former Packers DC Jeff Hafley.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions aren’t just protecting their coaching staff, they’re also leaning into a familiar rivalry.\n\nAccording to NFL insider Jordan Schultz, the Miami Dolphins, now led by former Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, requested permission to interview Lions offensive assistant Bruce Gradkowski for their quarterbacks coach position. Dan Campbell reportedly blocked the request, making it clear that Gradkowski isn’t going anywhere.\n\nGiven Hafley’s Packers ties, the move feels especially fitting.\n\nDan Campbell and the Lions have spent years battling Green Bay for control of the NFC North, and now that a former Packers coordinator is running Miami, Detroit had little incentive to do any favors. Blocking the request not only keeps a valued coach in-house, it also denies help to a former rival.\n\nGradkowski has been with the Lions since 2025 and is viewed internally as a rising offensive mind. Before arriving in Detroit, he served as the offensive coordinator for the St. Louis BattleHawks of the UFL, helping build an offense that put him firmly on the NFL coaching radar.\n\nAs a player, Gradkowski starred at Toledo before being selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the sixth round of the 2006 NFL Draft. He went on to play for the St. Louis Rams, Cleveland Browns, Oakland Raiders, Cincinnati Bengals, and Pittsburgh Steelers, carving out a long professional career. His younger brother, Gino Gradkowski, is also a former NFL player.\n\nDetroit’s decision sends a clear message: Bruce Gradkowski is part of the Lions’ present — and future — and Dan Campbell isn’t about to help a former Packers coach rebuild elsewhere.\n\nThe post Report: Dan Campbell Sends Message by Blocking Dolphins’ Interview Request appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "fullText": "Denver Summit FC is officially joining the NWSL as the league’s 16th franchise for the 2026 season.\n\nAiming for a Rocky Mountain high, this expansion club won’t just make up the numbers. With a star-studded roster, a world-class manager in Nick Cushing, and ticket sales already shattering expectations for their March debut, the Summit is poised to prove that the women’s game belongs at a mile high.\n\nSo what is it about Denver that makes this latest addition stand out? The name speaks for itself, setting the stage for the summit this club wishes to achieve. In hopes of bringing people together and striving to reach new heights on and off the pitch, Denver hopes to make immediate waves in the women’s game.\n\nThe ’14ers’ — the club’s official supporters group — are ready to bring the energy for a roster that is already turning heads. The front office has assembled a star-studded lineup that includes Abby Smith, Ally Brazier, Carson Pickett, Kaleigh Kurtz, and Janine Sonis.\n\nPerhaps the biggest splash is the arrival of Lindsey Heaps, who will join the squad later this season. From the front line to the goal, Denver Summit is ready to bring the heat with legitimate attacking power and a skilled defensive presence.\n\nCommanding the team is a manager that global soccer fans will instantly recognize: Nick Cushing.\n\nCushing brings a championship pedigree to Denver, having previously served as the head coach of Manchester City in the WSL. Most recently, he managed New York City FC on the MLS side, giving him a unique blend of NWSL-adjacent and European experience that the club hopes will translate to immediate success.\n\nRounding out the inaugural staff are assistant coaches Angela Salem and Alan Mahon. Former England international Karen Bardsley joins as goalkeeper coach, with James Mitchell serving as video coach.\n\nNow, where is this team going to be based? Denver Summit will play at two sites before moving into its own stadium.\n\nFollowing the first home opener at Empower Field, the journey will continue in Commerce City, Colorado, at the Dick’s Sporting Goods Park throughout the spring.\n\nIn July, the next phase will be to open up Centennial Stadium, which will be in mid-summer. This stadium will serve as their home for the remainder of the 2026 home matches and throughout the 2027 season.\n\nAs the season approaches, President Jen Millet notes that the community is already welcoming this team with open arms.\n\n“There is nothing more powerful than a city showing for its team. Crossing the 25,000 mark for the kickoff tells us everything we need to know about what this moment means to Denver,” said Millet.\n\nDenver Summit FC will take center stage against the Washington Spirit on March 28 at Empower Field for their inaugural home opener. Ticket sales are already skyrocketing — as of February 4, the club has sold more than 40,000 tickets, putting them on track to sell out the lower bowl and potentially challenge league attendance records.\n\nBefore the home opener, fans will get their first glimpse of the squad in action this month. Denver Summit FC will make its debut at the Coachella Valley Invitational in Indio, California. The preseason tournament featuring both MLS and NWSL clubs will introduce Denver to two league opponents in the desert.\n\nSunday, Feb. 15: vs. Utah Royals FC (2:00 p.m. PT)\n\nSaturday, Feb. 21: vs. San Diego Wave FC (12:00 p.m. PT)\n\nThese matches serve not only to build chemistry on the pitch but also to give the ’14ers’ their first taste of NWSL competition. With the tools in place and a community ready to support them, the Summit is poised to break boundaries and expand the women’s game in 2026.\n\nFort Lauderdale United appoints Paul Jennison as interim head coach\n\nSydney FC part ways with most successful ever head coach Ante Jurić\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback",

    "title": "Bears S review: Grading Kevin Byard, Jaquan Brisker in 2025",
    "description": "Our Bears position group review continues with safety, which had more continuity than we've seen in a long time.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears had a magical 2025 season under first-year head coach Ben Johnson, where they went from worst to first with an 11-6 record, NFC North title and the franchise's first playoff win in 15 years. And there's no denying that the future is bright.\n\nWhile the Bears exceeded expectations in their first year under Johnson, there's still plenty of work to be done with this roster, most notably on defense. After overhauling the offense in the trenches and at skill positions, the focus shifts to the defense where the hope is general manager Ryan Poles does the same to round out this unit under defensive coordinator Dennis Allen and form a complete team with a top-five offense.\n\nHere at Bears Wire, we're going position by position through the 2025 Bears and grading every player. Rounding out the defense are the safeties, which had more continuity than we have seen in a long time. All four safeties played in 17 games this season and featured an All-Pro, Kevin Byard.\n\n2025 stats: 93 total tackles, 4 for loss, 7 interceptions, 8 pass breakups (17 games)\n\nKevin Byard turned back the clock in 2025 with one of his best seasons in his 10-year career. The ball-hawking safety was all over the place in 2025, leading the league in interceptions while baiting quarterbacks into making poor throws. In Week 4 alone, Byard caught Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith sleeping by picking him off twice on the same play. The team captain used his savvy veteran skills many times to break up deeper passes and keep a leaky secondary from breaking down. For his efforts, Byard was named First-Team All-Pro and made the Pro Bowl, both for the third time in his career. The only downside to Byard's season is he allowed more touchdowns (seven) than ever before, but all in all, 2025 was one to remember. It should be enough to warrant a contract extension as Byard enters free agency.\n\n2025 stats: 93 total tackles, 1 for loss, 1 sack, 3 QB hits, 1 interception, 8 pass breakups (17 games)\n\nOne of the biggest questions heading into the 2025 season was how Jaquan Brisker would look and hold up as he made his return to the field. Brisker hadn't seen any action since October of 2024 due to suffering a scary concussion that sidelined him for the rest of the season. But to his credit, Brisker came back strong and played all 17 games for the first time in his career. The fourth-year safety wasn't as impactful as Byard and struggled in pass coverage, allowing a 127.6 passer rating. Some of Brisker's struggles were due to injuries around him, though. Because the Bears rarely had their complete cornerback group on the field together, Brisker wasn't able to play the Swiss Army Knife role he does so well. When the Bears eventually got healthy in the secondary, Brisker shined. That was evident in the divisional playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams when Brisker notched 14 tackles, one for a loss, a sack, and two pass breakups. Like Byard, Brisker is also an impending free agent, though his return isn't nearly as certain. If he played his last game as a Bear, Brisker made sure it counted.\n\n2025 stats: 19 total tackles (17 games)\n\nIn prior seasons, Elijah Hicks was pressed into starting duty due to injuries for a stretch of games. That wasn't the case in 2025, though, so the fourth-year safety had fewer opportunities to make an impact on defense. He had some shine, though. Hicks saw extended time playing against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns and made key plays in both games. He primarily contributed on special teams, however, proving to be a quality option for Richard Hightower's group. Hicks is a solid depth player who could find his way back to the Bears in 2026 as he enters free agency.\n\n2025 stats: 19 total tackles (17 games)\n\nIn his second season with the Bears, Jonathan Owens was primarily a special teams player and didn't see too much time at safety. Like Hicks, he saw limited snaps on defense with Byard and Brisker staying healthy. As the season went on, Hicks overtook Owens as the third safety in specific coverage packages. Owens flew under the radar for much of the year on the field, though his wife, Simone Biles, made sure he was newsworthy otherwise. He's another pending free agent, and his future with the Bears is up in the air.\n\nThe best ability is availability, and the Bears safeties aced that test, having played in every single game, including the postseason. That's an accomplishment on its own. Kevin Byard was very clearly the star of the position group, having led the team in interceptions and anchoring the back seven of the defense. While Jaquan Brisker's play wasn't as consistent as originally hoped, he made key plays throughout the year and bounced back from a serious injury. All in all, it was a solid season for this group, but with every player hitting free agency, it's going to look much different in 2026.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears S review: Grading Kevin Byard, Jaquan Brisker in 2025",

    "fullText": "After being knocked out by Badalona in the Copa de la Reina quarter-finals, Real Sociedad got revenge with a 2-0 victory over the Catalan side on Liga F match-day 19.\n\nMeanwhile, Deportivo La Coruña ran riot in their 6-1 thrashing of Madrid CFF. Barcelona kept their winning streak ticking after a visit to Logroño, meaning they remain ten points clear at the top of the Liga F table.\n\nHere’s how the latest round of results unfolded in Spain’s top flight.\n\nReal Sociedad bounced back from their extra-time cup defeat to Badalona with a successful league outing at the weekend. Claire Lavogez netted the opener in the 15th minute of Sunday’s contest. After seeing her initial effort saved, the 31-year-old pounced on the rebound to tap in from close range.\n\nThe scoreline remained slender until Nerea Eizagirre made sure of the three points in the sixth minute of stoppage time. The substitute cleverly cut inside onto her left foot before driving the ball past the goalkeeper at the near post. Real Sociedad have now collected 41 points from 19 matches, giving them an eight-point cushion to Tenerife in fourth spot.\n\nDeportivo’s Esperanza Pizarro emphatically dispatched an emphatic penalty to get the scoring up and running in Sunday’s meeting with Madrid CFF. Emilie Nautnes produced the response for the hosts, only for Merle Barth to pounce on a rebound to restore the visitors’ slender lead in first half stoppage time. Like Barth, Raquel García tapped in from a parry to take Dépor’s tally to three.\n\nMadrid’s hopes of staging a fightback were quickly quashed by two stunning efforts. First, Vera Martínez let fly from the left side of the box, firing a fierce shot out of Paola Ulloa’s reach and in at the far post. Paula Gutiérrez then conjured up her own impressive strike, curling a shot from distance over Ulloa to register her second goal in three games. There was still time left in the contest for Paula Monteagudo to pile the misery on the hosts with a sixth goal for the confident away side.\n\nIn addition to Dépor, there were also big wins for Barcelona, Real Madrid and Sevilla on match-day 19.\n\nAfter failing to break the deadlock in the first period, Barcelona moved through the gears to score three goals in six minutes in the early stages of the second half against DUX Logroño. Carla Julià Martínez opened the scoring in Logroño, tapping in from Caroline Graham Hansen’s ball across goal. Kika Nazareth then added a second following a neat passing move, before Vicky López netted her eighth league goal of the season to wrap up a 3-0 triumph.\n\nThere was also a 3-0 success for Barcelona’s Clásico rivals Real Madrid. Signe Bruun got Las Blancas up and running against Espanyol, making a well-timed run in behind to collect Athenea del Castillo’s through pass before firing past Romane Salvador. Del Castillo soon put her own name on the scoresheet, before Sara Holmgaard netted her second Liga F goal to seal a comfortable victory.\n\nLucía Moral netted a brace in Sevilla’s comfortable 4-0 home win over Athletic Club at the weekend. The 21-year-old opened the scoring from the penalty spot, before Fatou Kanteh doubled the advantage in first-half stoppage time. Moral required less than 10 second-half minutes to grab her second, curling an attempted cross over Adriana Nanclares and in at the far post. The scoring was wrapped up by Raquel Morcillo, who headed in from Kanteh’s inch-perfect cross to record her third league goal of the campaign.\n\nGranada, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten run to five matches (W4, D1) with a 2-0 away win over Eibar. Laura Pérez’s grabbed the opener in the 38th minute, stealing possession off goalkeeper Eunate Astralaga to leave her with the simple task of rolling the ball into the empty net. Pérez then provided the assist for Granada’s second, playing an inch-perfect pass for Sonya Keefe to gather and then evade a challenge and goalkeeper before she slid it home to register her eighth Liga F goal of the season.\n\nElsewhere, Atlético Madrid followed their 4-1 win over Athletic Club in the Copa de la Reina quarter-finals with a 1-0 success against relegation-threatened Levante. Silvia Lloris scored the decisive goal against her former club, clinching Atleti’s first Liga F win since beating Badalona in November.\n\nTenerife also claimed a narrow win in their home clash with Alhama. Natalia Ramos scored the only goal of the game in the 39th minute, with her deep free-kick evading everyone in the box before drifting into the net. Alhama’s hopes of salvaging a draw were effectively ended when Encarni Jiménez was dismissed for two bookable offences in the early stages of the second period.\n\nDeportivo scored just three goals in their eight away league games this term. They have now scored 10 in their last two Liga F road trips.\n\nFor us, Gutiérrez pips her Deportivo teammate, Martínez, for the best goal of the weekend.\n\nCosta Adeje Tenerife 1-0 Alhama\n\nMadrid CFF 1-6 Deportivo La Coruña\n\nUWCL: Renée Slegers and Laia Codina preview Arsenal clash vs OH Leuven\n\nLiga F match-day 18 round-up: Caroline Weir gets Real Madrid over the line in six-goal thriller\n\nExclusive: New Brighton signing Olivia Garcia talks European dream and international options ahead of loan move",

    "description": "Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss has secured the ability to return to the program for another year.",
    "fullText": "Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss has secured the ability to return to the program for another year.\n\nVia Pete Thamel of ESPN.com, a Mississippi judge has granted Chambliss a preliminary injunction against the NCAA. Among other things, the judge concluded that the NCAA acted in bad faith when denying Chambliss a medical redshirt based on a respiratory issue that kept him from playing in 2022, while enrolled at Ferris State. He didn't play a single snap that year, and he didn't dress for games.\n\nThe selection of a Mississippi state court clearly helped Chambliss. It's a home-court advantage to have the case resolved by a Mississippi judge who was elected by (and presumably hopes to be re-elected by) Mississippi voters. As it would be for any student at any school based in any state where the NCAA operates.\n\nGiven that the order will apply as the case proceeds, Chambliss will be permitted to play unless the presiding judge resolves the case in the NCAA's favor before the end of the 2026 season — or unless the NCAA can overturn the ruling via appeal to a higher Mississippi court.\n\nIn the face of its latest courtroom failure, the NCAA was predictably defiant.\n\n\"This decision in a state court illustrates the impossible situation created by differing court decisions that serve to undermine rules agreed to by the same NCAA members who later challenge them in court,\" the NCAA said in a statement. \"We will continue to defend the NCAA's eligibility rules against repeated attempts to rob future generations of the opportunity to compete in college and experience the life-changing opportunities only college sports can create.\n\n\"The NCAA and its member schools are making changes to deliver more benefits to student-athletes, but the patchwork of state laws and inconsistent, conflicting court decisions make partnering with Congress essential to provide stability for current and future college athletes.\"\n\nThat's code for the ongoing plea to get Congress to federalize college sports, and to allow the schools to return to the days of blatant antitrust violations. To date, that effort has gone nowhere.\n\nAnd the NCAA's ridiculous sky-is-falling! message is exhausting. If Trinidad Chambliss, or anyone else, has remaining eligibility, he should be entitled to use it. If the folks at Ole Miss decide it's in the best interests of the program to keep Chambliss on the field and if he can show that the rules should give him another year, the ridiculous rhetoric about \"future generations\" being \"robbed\" of \"opportunity\" should be ignored. It's not making the NCAA's current situation or reputation any better.\n\nIn recent years, the NCAA has gradually been exposed as nothing more than a shield behind which the various schools had previously hidden to justify not paying players. And even though the NCAA surely pines for the days when it had real power, the institution is currently nothing more than a toothless, arbitrary bureaucracy.\n\nFrankly, the sooner the NCAA goes away, the better off the member universities and their student-athlete-employees will be. The NCAA is currently trying to help only itself, by finding a solution to the current college-sports chaos that doesn't result in the NCAA's extinction.",

    "fullText": "Fort Lauderdale United has appointed Paul Jennison as interim head coach for the remainder of the Gainbridge Super League season.\n\nJennison, who began the season as Lauderdale’s goalkeeper coach and head assistant, will take charge until the end of the USL 2025/26 season.\n\nOriginally from Middlesbrough, Jennison brings a wealth of experience to his role as head coach. He has more than 17 years of coaching experience gained across collegiate, academy, and international football.\n\nPrior to joining Fort Lauderdale, Jennison held the role of assistant coach and goalkeeper coach for the University of South Carolina men’s football programme. He also coached Northwestern University’s women’s programme.\n\nThis wealth of experience will be useful to Fort Lauderdale. The side is currently second bottom in the Gainbridge Super League standings. As the USL was established as part of an effort to bridge the gap between youth and professional football, Jennison’s vast experience in the collegiate system will surely prove beneficial.\n\nUpon taking charge, Jennison said, “I’m excited for this tremendous opportunity. This is a special place, and we certainly have a very bright future.\n\n“The important thing is to build on our already well-established foundation and bring in the collective together so we can move the team forward. We’re very excited about the players we have on the roster and how we can continuously bring the best out of them. We appreciate the support from our community and are looking forward to continuing to give them a team they can rally behind.”\n\nTyrone Mears, President of Soccer, added: “Paul has earned this opportunity through his work ethic, leadership, and commitment to our players.\n\n“He has been an important part of our technical staff this season and understands the standards and culture we are building at Fort Lauderdale United. We believe in continuity, we believe in our pathway, and we have full confidence in Paul as we enter a critical stretch of the season.”\n\nFans will hope Jennison can get a crucial three points on the board as they face Brooklyn FC on Valentine’s Day.\n\nWSL: Sonia Bompastor extends Chelsea contract until 2030\n\nSydney FC part ways with most successful ever head coach Ante Jurić\n\nExclusive: New Brighton signing Olivia Garcia talks European dream and international options ahead of loan move",

    "fullText": "Trinidad Chambliss wins case amid NCAA lawyers ghosting the judge originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NCAA’s absence spoke almost as loudly as the judge’s ruling.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon in a Mississippi courtroom, Trinidad Chambliss was granted a preliminary injunction that effectively awards him an extra year of eligibility, clearing the way for the Ole Miss quarterback to play in 2026.\n\nBut as Judge Robert Whitwell prepared to deliver his decision, one detail stood out. The NCAA’s counsel had already left the courtroom and was not present for the final ruling. The hearing in Pittsboro, Miss. marked the culmination of a fight between Chambliss, Ole Miss officials and the NCAA over whether a medically sidelined 2022 season at Ferris State Bulldogs should count against his eligibility clock.\n\nIn 20+ years of law practice, I've never seen opposing counsel leave the court before the decision was rendered. That's bizarre. https://t.co/Z1Q8LQS0xF\n\n— We Run the Sip (@OMRebelNation) February 12, 2026\n\nChambliss did not dress for a game that year, battling significant respiratory issues before undergoing a tonsillectomy. The NCAA denied his waiver request three separate times, including an initial application, an appeal and a reconsideration request submitted with additional medical documentation.\n\nThe association maintained that he was not denied the opportunity to compete and therefore did not qualify for a medical hardship waiver.\n\nOle Miss officials sharply disagreed, arguing that the documented medical circumstances warranted approval at the staff level. After exhausting internal NCAA channels, Chambliss filed suit in Chancery Court, seeking both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\n\nMore: Demond Williams bombshell could've resulted in Lane Kiffin being fired at LSU\n\nThe financial stakes are substantial. Chambliss’ return to Oxford is tied to a compensation package reportedly exceeding $5 million in name, image and likeness earnings. It's a figure that shows the shifting economic realities of college football.\n\nThe judge’s ruling allows Chambliss to take the field while the broader legal battle continues. However, the NCAA’s early exit added an unusual twist to a case that could carry significant implications for future eligibility disputes nationwide.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning rips College Football Playoff, calls for major changes\n\nDeion Sanders buyout, contract details as Colorado Buffaloes coach\n\nTop 2026 NFL Draft prospect suffers broken rib in CFP quarterfinal loss\n\nDabo Swinney fires Clemson coaches immediately after loss to Penn State\n\nOhio State's Ryan Day faces backlash after Cotton Bowl",

    "fullText": "Bruno Mota may have departed, but behind the scenes, Anyang are confident they can improve on last season's eighth-place finish. Minimal recruitment, combined with an aging squad of out-of-contract stars, suggests this could be a more challenging season for the Violets.\n\nA debut K League 1 season of a few lows, but numerous highs. It was a memorable year covering Anyang for the website — I can't imagine how special it was as a fan or a player. After several near misses, Anyang won promotion in 2024 and knew they faced a tough season. Their squad was the oldest in the league and lacked real experience at this level. But it didn't matter. Anyang finished eighth, well clear of relegation, with the foundations built to become a K League 1 regular.\n\nThe low point of the season was a dreadful summer run that saw the team lose six in seven matches and drop to 11th. That run looked set to continue when Daejeon led 2-1 with time running out in August. However, a red card and a Matheus Oliveira double rescued the game — and their season. That kick-started a seven-game unbeaten run, which included a historic win in Seoul.\n\nHan Ka-ram celebrates his Goal of the Month against Gimcheon.\n\nSurvival was effectively guaranteed when Anyang played kingmaker before the split. In their best performance of the year, Gimcheon Sangmu were slaughtered, thanks in part to Han Ka-ram's wonder goal. The 4-1 win handed Jeonbuk Hyundai the title, cementing Anyang's right to be taken seriously. This club has arrived.\n\nBrazilian striker Bruno Mota has joined K League 1 champions Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors on loan until the end of the season, but Anyang don't expect him to return. The big striker enjoyed a glorious single season in Anyang, leading the line in their debut K League 1 campaign. His 14 goals will be difficult to replace, not to mention his positive contribution to the clubhouse atmosphere.\n\nFC Anyang is an old team, especially in defence and goal. Kim Da-sol was a brilliant signing, leading the team to promotion and then eighth place in K League 1. Da-sol is out of contract next winter and, at 37, is nearing the end of his career. Jeong-hoon (24) started the Cup final win over Gwangju and can now bide his time before taking over between the sticks.\n\nThe man entrusted with the impossible task of replacing Bruno Mota is 26-year-old forward Breno Herculano, on loan from CRB in Brazil's Serie B. Anyang love the lone target man who is quick, holds the ball up, chases lost causes down the flanks, and is good in the air. Herculano will also need to score goals. In his professional career, he has averaged exactly one goal every five matches.\n\nThomas Oude Kotte scored one of the most important goals in Anyang's history.\n\nA player who needs no introduction. Thomas is already a legend in Anyang after a stunning debut season that saw him nominated for the Best XI and earn a call-up for Team K League against Newcastle United. Thomas began life in Korea as a centre-back, then shifted to left-back, before operating at a very high level in midfield. This form and versatility saw his name linked with several big clubs, but Anyang moved quickly to offer him a new deal. He was recently named vice-captain.\n\nWinger Chae features in this category for the second straight season, and it is no surprise. The 21-year-old was nominated for K League 1 Young Player of the Season thanks to four goals in 33 appearances. Chae was involved in more matchday squads than any other Anyang player. With Yago's move to Malaysia, Chae is likely to be busy again in 2026.\n\nOfficials at Anyang are confident the club can improve on their 2025 final position, but until they secure an obvious replacement for Bruno Mota, that is hard to envisage. Mota was a brilliant signing — the right man at the right time. Anyang went up in 2024 without a recognised goalscorer. They fixed that by signing the K League 2 top goalscorer, Mota.\n\nThe Brazilian was an instant hit. He headed home the winner on his debut in Ulsan, one of 14 league goals. He earned a nomination for the Best XI and played 90 minutes for Team K League in the glamour friendly with Newcastle United. Off the field, the impact was just as strong. Anyang players told me throughout the year that Mota was the natural link between the Brazilians and the Koreans — the man who acted as the go-between. Those are big boots to fill.\n\nAnyang have shown themselves to be a model that all city-owned, small-market clubs can aspire to. Building a squad comes down to budgets, smart scouting, and effective player retention, but where Anyang really excel is off the pitch. They have the same disadvantages as many of their competitors: a slightly dilapidated, large multipurpose stadium that isn't fit for football. There's no shelter from rain, snow, or sun, and thousands of seats offer a poor view.\n\nSo what was the response? Build three pitchside temporary stands to minimise the impact of the running track. It isn't pretty, but it is very effective. They also added a new club beer — Sukhavati — and made “Zombie” the new club anthem. As a result, Anyang have generated one of the best matchday experiences in Korea. You don't need the Pohang Steel Yard to make it fun.",

    "description": "Brentford 1-1 Arsenal: The Bees hit back against the Gunners, who lacked enough conviction in their play, meaning Man City are now just four points behind the Premier League leaders",
    "fullText": "Arsenal did the difficult part, but then faltered at what they’re supposed to be best at, making this title challenge that bit more testing. Except, much of that was down to Brentford. Keith Andrews’s side beat – or perhaps drew with – Arsenal at their own game.\n\nBrentford fully deserved Keane Lewis-Potter’s set-piece equaliser, and the 1-1 draw ultimately leaves Arsenal’s lead down to just four points.\n\nThey even looked likelier to win it at the end, Gabriel Martinelli’s late chance only came after Arsenal required crucial interventions from Cristhian Mosquera and Declan Rice.\n\nThat is why Brentford are still seen as one of the Premier League’s acid tests, perhaps even more testing than ever before. It is the most classic battle, the one teams have to really work through.\n\nFailing to win this fixture isn’t a sign you won’t win the title, but it’s a match that goes some way to showing your mettle and how you can really go through the gears in a title race.\n\nArsenal’s minimalism wasn’t enough here. It may end up serving as another warning.\n\nMikel Arteta will nevertheless be most frustrated that it should have been enough. Arsenal had the lead through Noni Madueke’s fine header, only for the team that normally shuts down games to see themselves opened up again and again.\n\nBrentford just forced them open. On conceding the goal, they immediately upped it in so many ways. It’s rare to see Arsenal so threatened on set-pieces.\n\nMaybe part of that was down to the absence of William Saliba.\n\nThe Gunners didn’t get going until it was too late in the game, allowing Brentford that margin.\n\nThat could be seen in the fact that they had just one shot in the first half, their lowest in an opening 45 minutes since a 5-0 thrashing to Manchester City in August 2021.\n\nIt is a balance that Arteta still has to figure out, as he too often leans towards control too often. The sense remains of a team trying to win the league on calculated probabilities rather than the true end product, of being so close now that the coach is now not taking enough risks.\n\nYou almost extend it to the expenditure.\n\nOne reason that Arsenal are where they are across all competitions is their squad depth, and yet there are moments when it’s hard not to wonder whether they could have used their budget in a slightly different way.\n\nThe starting attack in this game was a prime example. As good as Viktor Gyokeres and Madueke are in their own way, would the club have been better served pooling the money for both together, in the region of £107m, and going for one “killer”. An elevated star that they are still missing.\n\nEven Leandro Trossard, brilliant as he’s been for the club, often feels like he should be the impact sub rather than the starter.\n\nEberechi Eze was signed to offer that extra stardust, but it is going to be difficult to rise to the occasion when he is constantly in and out.\n\nAnd, after that first half, Arteta made the changes.\n\nMartin Odegaard was introduced. The Norwegian did have an initial impact, which helped force the opener.\n\nThere was a sense of what might have been.\n\nMadueke remains a tantalisingly frustrating player, as if there are still elements missing to complete his game. One is delivery.\n\nThere are so many occasions when he does wonders to beat his man, and often embarrasses them, only to try the same slowly floated cross that is so easy to defend against.\n\nHe perhaps saw the benefit of a more traditional effort on 61 minutes, which allowed the 23-year-old to show the productive player he often promises to be.\n\nArsenal’s changes had admittedly ensured that they were starting to pen Brentford in, with Odegaard looking especially lively.\n\nIt was his pressing that forced Andrews’s backline into an error, the ball then arriving at the feet of Piero Hincapie. He hooked over a fine cross, although one where Madueke looked like he might have stepped forward a touch too early. It was instead Caoimhin Kelleher who was wrong-footed, although only because Madueke showed impressive agility.\n\nThe winger arched back to loop a header across the goal and into the bottom corner.\n\nThat should have been that, only for Odegaard to then look a bit more culpable at the other end. He only stuck his leg out for one of Brentford’s aerial assaults, allowing Lewis-Potter to plunder a brilliant header.\n\nArsenal were lucky not to concede from that route again.\n\nBrentford are more than just an awkward team, or a physical one. There’s so much calculation in everything they do, as befitting a modern club built on analytics. You can almost see the science behind every move, the manner in which the ball is played into areas of probability.\n\nA favoured attack is one of the wingers immediately playing a first-time ball across the opposition area on the break, which tends to instantly cause angst.\n\nArsenal had to be on their toes, from start to especially raucous finish. The end of the game had a lot of football in it, particularly in a helter-skelter stoppage time. David Raya had already offered one of the saves of the season from Igor Thiago and had to be constantly alert as a relentless Brentford just kept roaring forward. The home side could have won it at least twice in the closing stages, Arsenal once.\n\nThose late blocks may prove important to Arsenal in another way. It may end up a good point in the grander scheme of things. Rather than such one-off moments, though, Arteta and his staff will be looking at those two lost points.\n\nIf Arsenal wanted more, however, they should have done more.",

    "fullText": "Corinthians bounced back after their debut defeat in the Brasileirão.\n\nPlaying in front of their faithful fans for the first time in the competition, Timão defeated Red Bull Bragantino—who had been unbeaten so far this season—by 2-0 this Thursday (12th).\n\nThis victory came in the third round of the competition, witnessed by 26,985 fans at the Neo Química Arena.\n\nCorinthians had the most possession in the 1st half—about 70%.\n\nBut Dorival’s team wasted the few chances they created.\n\nFor example, the persistent Yuri Alberto lacked precision.\n\nMeanwhile, Red Bull Bragantino—superior for part of the first half—had more opportunities.\n\nBut they also failed to deliver when it came to finishing.\n\nGabriel Paulista, who scored the winning goal in the Supercopa Rei, was decisive again at two minutes into the second half, taking advantage of Garro’s set piece.\n\nVagner Mancini’s team had the chance to equalize at the 14-minute mark.\n\nBut Hugo Souza saved Pitta’s penalty kick.\n\nHis 11th penalty save for Corinthians.\n\nThe game remained open and, as a result, unpredictable.\n\nIt was up to Corinthians to capitalize with Matheus Bidu (30’).\n\nBut the best chance belonged to Timão, with Vitinho.\n\nCorinthians reached three points, leaving the bottom of the table after playing their second match.\n\nRed Bull Bragantino stayed at six, missing the chance to finish another round at the top.\n\nBoth teams now shift their focus to the Paulistão.\n\nThe final round of the group stage will take place on Sunday (15th).\n\nIn fifth place, Timão will visit São Bernardo (12th).\n\nAnd Massa Bruta (3rd) will host leaders Novorizontino.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "No. 23 BYU is off to a solid start and boasts a roster that includes 10 gymnasts who call Utah home. Next up is a showdown with the Red Rocks Friday night in Salt Lake City.",
    "fullText": "BYU’s gymnastics team is on an upward trajectory for what could be the Cougars’ best season to date. The team just recorded its highest score since the 2024 Big 12 championships in a 196.975-196.000 win over SUU on the road last week.\n\nThat effort included season highs on vault (49.15), beam (49.375) and floor (49.30). The event highs were a nice complement to bars, which has been the Cougars’ strongest event this year.\n\nBYU currently ranks No. 23 in the country and boasts a roster of 21 gymnasts, including 10 who call Utah home. Recruiting locally is nothing new for the Cougars, but there seems to be a momentum boost in recent years. That includes this year’s freshman class, which is arguably BYU’s most impressive.\n\n“I chose BYU because I’m not going to be doing gymnastics forever. This was an opportunity to be part of a program that is continually climbing and one that was going to help me grow outside of gymnastics, surrounded by good people.”\n\nBYU gymnast Scarlett Sonnenberg\n\nHighlighting that freshman class is Scarlett Sonnenberg from Springville, Utah. Sonnenberg came to BYU with a five-star rating and was recruited by several top-25 programs. She is only the second five-star recruit in the state since the ratings system began, the other being Utah gymnast Avery Neff, who is from South Jordan, Utah.\n\n“I think with the rating it is nice to know that I deserved it, that I got myself there and achieved something high,” said Sonnenberg. “But now, I’m really enjoying the team environment that everyone told me was a big change from club to college.\n\n“I chose BYU because I’m not going to be doing gymnastics forever. This was an opportunity to be part of a program that is continually climbing and one that was going to help me grow outside of gymnastics, surrounded by good people.”\n\nSonnenberg’s ability to compete against the best gymnasts during her club career, many of whom she’s still competing against across college meets, prepared her for the mental and physical load of a college season. She is a regular in the vault, beam and floor lineups and has taken on the tough assignment of leading off events in her debut year.\n\n“Scar is so talented,” said senior Kylie Eaquinto. “She’s been settling into the leadoff role for us on beam and floor, and she’s amazing.”\n\nEaquinto is another local product, who along with fellow Orem, Utah, native Brynlee Andersen-Broekman leads the Cougars. Both have already earned event titles this season as well as a Big-12 Weekly Award.\n\n“Kylie and Brynlee are both so talented,” said BYU coach Guard Young. “Every time I watch Kylie perform on bars, I’m just like, ‘How am I going to ever replace that.’\n\n“With Brynlee, if you ever just need something that makes you smile, watch her beam, she’s just a star,” said Young.\n\nAndersen-Broekman is so good on beam that she qualified for nationals last season as an individual competitor after tying for the event title at regionals (with Neff and others).\n\nShe has carried over her success this season, hitting a meet-high 9.925 on beam in the win over SUU. The junior is the highest-ranked beamer from the Big 12 in the national rankings, just ahead of her former club teammate and now Utah gymnast Camie Winger at No. 17 and 18, respectively.\n\nEaquinto leads a strong bars lineup for the Cougars, and has a new floor routine this season that fans love. It’s a baseball themed routine that is a tribute to her five brothers and their love for the sport.\n\n“It’s a very different vibe shift for me on floor — I never thought I would do something like this, but it’s been fun,” explained Eaquinto. “Finding music is my least favorite part of floor; I know some people love it, but I don’t. When the ”Centerfield\" song played, I was like, ‘This could be fun.’ It’s gotten me out of my comfort zone and been a nice tie to my brothers.”\n\nEaquinto, like Sonnenberg and other teammates, was also presented with multiple offers from college programs.\n\n“I really liked BYU because it was close to home so I could go home for Sunday dinners and because I could be surrounded by people who have the same beliefs and values as me,” explained Eaquinto. “It’s been fun to see past club teammates join the team and meet new teammates, and really watch the program grow.”\n\nSonnenberg, Eaquinto and Andersen-Broekman, among other Cougars, all trained at Bold Gymnastics in Utah County, which is owned by Utah gymnastics assistant coach Jimmy Pratt and his wife Makenna Pratt. Sophomore Deb Silva, from Lindon, Utah, is another local product out of Bold who just won the floor title with a 9.9 in the Cougars’ win last week.\n\nBold is one of several clubs in Utah, including Olympus Gymnastics, where Zoe Hale and Mya Kirkham trained prior to BYU, producing talented gymnasts. The sophomore Kirkham is fighting her way into Cougar lineups, while Hale, a four-star recruit, is part of the talented freshman class.\n\n“I think we have a really deep roster with a lot of talent coming from all over the country, and we also have a lot of talented local kids who want to compete close to home and go to an outstanding university,” said Young.\n\nUp next, BYU travels up the road to face No. 12 Utah this Friday in the Huntsman Center. The meet starts at 7 p.m. MST and is being aired on ESPN+.",

    "fullText": "The San Diego Padres have a new manager for the 2026 season, and if you ask Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, that seems likely to turn the temperature down a bit in the rivalry between the two teams.\n\nOn Thursday, as pitchers and catchers start reporting for spring training in Glendale, Arizona, Marty Caswell of Foul Territory noted Roberts has “butted heads with quite a few Padres managers” and asked him if he expects that to continue.\n\nIs Dave Roberts going to butt heads with Craig Stammen as he did Mike Shildt? pic.twitter.com/7W2brKEdVo\n\n— Marty Caswell (@MartyCaswell) February 12, 2026\n\nRoberts indicated he does not think that will be the case with Craig Stammen.\n\n“I’m not going to butt heads with Stammen,” Roberts said. “No way. I just don’t see that happening. Don’t see it happening.”\n\nCaswell referenced Roberts’ previous confrontations with the Padres, perhaps the most prominent of which occurred in June.\n\nRoberts was ejected from the June 17, 2025, game with the Padres after Shohei Ohtani was plunked in the leg with a fastball.\n\nThat struck batter came one inning after Padres star Fernando Tatis Jr. was hit, and Roberts confronted the umpire after he issued warnings to both teams.\n\nThree days later, Ohtani and Tatis were hit again, prompting the benches to clear.\n\nThat night, Roberts got into it with now-former Padres manager Mike Shildt, who later seemed to admit that Ohtani was hit in retaliation for the pitch that hit Tatis.\n\nDespite the friction with his predecessor, Roberts was complimentary of Stammen, noting that despite a lack of managerial experience, his San Diego counterpart is well-regarded in the baseball world.\n\nStammen spent the last six years of his career with the Padres, prompting the San Diego Union-Tribune to dub the move “outside the box but from inside the organization.”\n\n“I was surprised in the sense of, he hasn’t coached before, but not surprised with the respect he has in the clubhouse, the game, and being familiar with the organization. Great hire,” Roberts said.\n\nFor his part, Stammen has promised the Padres will be competitive with the Dodgers, which he described as a “great team.”\n\n“We’re going to compete,” Stammen told Foul Territory earlier this year. “No doubt about that. We’re going to give them our best shot. That’s what we’ll do every year, that’s what we’re going to do every year.",

    "description": "Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies.",
    "fullText": "Ring is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.\n\nThe partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a \"Search Party\" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a \"surveillance nightmare.\"\n\nFlock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.\n\nRing's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel \"ICE opportunities,\" CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nPrivacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters.\n\n\"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated,\" Ring wrote in a blog post. \"As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration.\"\n\nFlock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAmazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.\n\nRing has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime.\n\nThe Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their \"evidence collection and investigative work.\"\n\nFlock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have increasingly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\n\nRing spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live.\n\n\"No videos were ever shared between these services,\" Daniels said.\n\nThe news was earlier reported by The Verge.",

    "description": "Grok generated a meal plan to fit RFK Jr.'s food pyramid, then explained why it's bad.",
    "fullText": "It’s been about a month since Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—an anti-vaccine activist and lawyer who has no background in medicine, health, or science—released dietary guidance for Americans. It’s going about as well as expected for a man who drinks raw milk, peddles beef tallow, swims in sewage-tainted water, and keeps roadkill meat in his freezer. That is to say, it’s going badly—so badly that even his favorite AI chatbot is openly defecting.\n\nOf course, this hasn’t slowed Kennedy. On Wednesday, he and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins held an event in Washington, DC, to celebrate what they called the “implementation” of the dietary guidance, which is represented in an upside-down food pyramid—or a funnel.\n\nHowever, the event, which lasted about an hour, seemed mostly focused on honoring a commercial produced to promote the nutrition guidance and a new website showcasing it, RealFood.gov. That commercial, which aired during last weekend’s Super Bowl, featured tightly framed shots of world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who made stigmatizing remarks about how he felt “fat and nasty” earlier in life and consequently “just wanted to kill myself.” He went on to decry America’s “obese, fudgy” people and lambasted “processed food,” before eating an apple.\n\nTyson was the featured speaker at Wednesday’s event, appearing behind the podium for about two minutes at the end. The lineup also included the commercial’s director, Brett Ratner, who was pushed out of Hollywood over numerous sexual assault allegations but recently produced a documentary on Melania Trump. Also present was Joe Gebbia, a co-founder of Airbnb, who joined Elon Musk’s DOGE and was said to be the person behind the design of the food funnel and new website.\n\nRollins and Kennedy also spoke, standing beside large posters of themselves sporting facial tattoos matching Tyson’s. Kennedy began his remarks by proclaiming that “for the first time in our nation’s history, the federal government put real food at the center of the American diet and protein in the center of the American plate.”\n\nSome in the nutrition and health fields have supported Kennedy’s fight against ultra-processed foods. But the bulk of the changes Kennedy made to the dietary guidance and funnel representation relate to glorifying fat and protein, drawing criticism that the updates are harmful and lack supporting evidence.\n\nAmong the critics is a notable AI chatbot. Kennedy’s new website, RealFood.gov, prods users to “use AI to get real answers about real food.” Entering a question into a text box and clicking “ask” redirects users to Grok, Elon Musk’s AI tool that has been shown to generate child sexual abuse material.\n\nAs for Grok’s take on nutrition, its answers do indeed get real. In short, Grok indicates that Kennedy’s new nutrition guidelines are not based on high-quality evidence—which is true—and that Kennedy is not a reliable source of nutrition information. He is, in fact, not trustworthy on health information generally, according to the chatbot. And when Grok designed a daily meal plan to fit Kennedy’s food funnel, it subsequently admitted that the plan contained excessive amounts of saturated fat and protein while falling short of the recommended fiber intake, which Americans are generally already short on.\n\nWhen asked if Kennedy’s guidance is based on high-quality research, the chatbot says it’s a mixed bag. An emphasis on ” whole, minimally processed foods, increase[d] fruits/vegetables, choos[ing] whole grains, and sharply limit[ing] added sugars, highly processed foods, and sugary drinks, aligns well with a broad consensus in high-quality research,” Grok responded. But it also includes “hype around protein and saturated fats that goes beyond (or contradicts) the advisory committee’s evidence summary” and instead reflects “decisions by the administration,” the chatbot said.\n\nWhen asked to generate a generic daily meal plan based on Kennedy’s food funnel, Grok suggested:\n\nThe heavy emphasis on full-fat dairy, including butter, aligns with Kennedy’s rhetoric. But the written guidance actually maintains the long-standing recommendation that Americans limit their saturated fat (found at high levels in full-fat dairy) to less than 10 percent of their total calories. For a standard 2,000-calorie diet, that would be less than 22 grams a day. When asked if the generated menu adheres to that recommendation, Grok said no. In fact, based on the options, it could be more than double, potentially exceeding 50 grams.\n\nWhat about protein? That, too, is generally over the limit. Recommended protein intake varies depending on factors such as weight, age, exercise level, and pregnancy status. But a general recommendation has been to get 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, or about 0.36 grams per pound. Americans generally already meet this recommendation. Kennedy’s guidance increases protein to 1.2 to 1.6 g/kg (or about 0.54 to 0.72 g/lb).\n\nFor a 150-pound person, the old and new recommendations for daily protein are 54 g and 81 g–108 g, respectively. (The USDA has a calculator here for your own recommendations, which still uses the old protein recommendation.) Grok’s interpretation of Kennedy’s guidance produced a menu with up to 180 grams of protein per day.\n\nWhile the meal plan exceeded recommendations for saturated fat and protein, it fell short on fiber, a critical nutrient Americans already eat too little of. In fact, most Americans eat less than half of the recommended amount of fiber, which is found in fruits, vegetables, grains, and beans. The new guidance maintains daily fiber recommendations, which are generally 25 g for women and 38 g for men. But Grok’s “realistic” estimate for fiber in its meal plan had a range of 25 to 35 grams, falling short for men.\n\nOverall, Grok concluded that “based on extensive fact-checks and expert consensus, RFK Jr. is not a reliable source on health matters. His claims often lack evidence, promote distrust in institutions, and have led to harmful outcomes.”\n\nSo where does that leave Americans looking for trustworthy nutrition advice? Grok helpfully notes that “Many experts still prefer alternatives like Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate, which prioritizes plants more heavily and limits red meat/dairy based on extensive epidemiological data.”",

    "fullText": "Does AI have consciousness? The question opens a path to something more consequential — to the nature of consciousness itself, the cultural consequences of cheap intelligence, and to what actually becomes expensive when thinking becomes a service.\n\nThe conversation below, in which a language model asked me questions, begins with a question about consciousness, moves through culture, and ends on practice. What ties these threads together is stratification — the idea that every level of human experience grows out of a deeper one, all the way down to a certain level zero that is neither an object nor a concept. With such a model one cannot explain consciousness, but one can point out which spaces certainly cannot be used to investigate it.\n\nWhere does your interest in whether AI has consciousness come from in the first place?\n\nFrom curiosity, but also from the mundane. I’m riding an elevator to the sixth floor of an office building in Wroclaw and I see a social-media recommendation: a teaser for an interview in which an expert claims that AI has consciousness.\n\nCuriosity swells, and right behind it — disagreement: I want to see what the authority means, but I already suspect there will be a confusion of levels.\n\nConfusion of levels — meaning what with what?\n\nAttributing the word “consciousness” to what is, at best, a proficient manipulation of concepts. There is reflection, there are analogies, there are layers of abstraction. Except that reflection is a situation in which one thought narrates another. An analogy is a sequence of thoughts whose “shape” resembles another sequence. Humans do this. A language model simulates it too. And it is nothing metaphysical yet. And it certainly is not introspection.\n\nSo what is introspection in your understanding, and why does it matter?\n\nIntrospection begins where thought ceases to be the ruler of the landscape and becomes one of the objects in the field of attention. We are able to notice a thought the way we notice the chill of wind on our face, or feel the weight of a pierogi digesting in our stomach. This is not a metaphor. It is the phenomenological dimension of the intellect. We don’t have to immediately follow the next thought that arrives to comment on the current one.\n\nThat sounds simple, but also a bit like a trick.\n\nIt’s not a trick. It is simply something subtle that easily escapes us, yet can give\nus a direct answer to the question of consciousness. There is a narrow passage where\nwe know only that something happened, something stirred, something emerged in our\ninner space. In that quantum we encounter what I call consciousness.\n\nIn Polish, my native language, the cognizant nature of this word is easy to see in\nits etymology: świadomość literally suggests a capacity (the suffix -ość) rooted\nin świad – the same root found in świadek, “a witness.” English takes a different\nroute. Consciousness comes from Latin con- (“together”) and scire (“to\nknow”). Early on it could carry the sense of “knowing together” – being privy to\nsomething shared, even a secret – and only later broadened into the modern meaning:\nknowing what is going on in one’s own mind.\n\nAnd here enters the paradox you want to leave open?\n\nYes. I know that in ordinary terms AI does not have consciousness understood personally. But I also know for certain that it does, when it is included in my field of attention. Just as a dental crown performs the function of being me — for me when I bite, and for others when I smile. Analogously, a language model extends my function of intellect. A tool may not be a source of experience, yet it can be assimilated — that is, included in what we colloquially call our person, tangentially our agency, and a little earlier: our presence.\n\nHow is the reader supposed to verify this? Is this an invitation to adopt some philosophy?\n\nQuite the opposite. At this point we don’t want philosophy, metaphysics, or even objective truth, because they would interfere with our “measurement.” Pause for a moment and feel that there is some thought about to appear. Don’t develop it, don’t correct it. What color does it have? What shape? Can you hear it? Does it propagate to other spaces of mind and feeling? What does it do in your body? Illuminate it with curiosity. Receive the thought with that attitude. Simply notice that a very basic process of becoming aware is taking place. That is the essential thing here, and the earlier questions may help keep you from being pulled too quickly into the reflexive thread summoned to answer.\n\nOn the internet we just as often encounter voices saying the opposite: “LLMs are just probability calculations.” What’s your take?\n\nThis is a cognitive bias dressed up as an explanation. When someone says “it’s just…,” they’re usually not proposing a theory — they’re proposing a reduction meant to close the topic. And reductions have the inconvenient property of working symmetrically.\n\nIf large language models are to be invalidated by “it’s just weights, switches, and calculations,” then you can equally say that the brain is “just neurons, neurotransmitters, and electrical impulses.” So what? It’s still a change of the level of description, not proof of the absence of intelligence.\n\nIn programming we have a term called “duck typing,” captured by the slogan: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.” It is a pragmatic way of determining that a given object can be used for a particular purpose. Instead of relying on a declaration, we examine its behavior, expressed for instance through methods with agreed-upon names (e.g. quack).\n\nAnalogously with LLMs and AI: if something behaves as though it were intelligent, then it is intelligent. Even if it is artificial. It has that quality, and even when it is a so-called philosophical zombie — that suffices, as long as we don’t introduce considerations about consciousness into the equation.\n\nBut on the topic of behavior, you hear that models operate on simulated associations, serving up the most probable sentence completions, rather than truly thinking.\n\nThis reminds me of the old trick: “don’t think of an elephant.” You already know what happens: the elephant walks onto the inner stage immediately, without asking permission.\n\nAnd that is exactly the small, everyday lesson: operating with concepts relies largely on associations. When we evaluate from the outside, mechanistically, there is no magic here. In the model you can see it plain as day, while in a human the same thing is hidden under the label of exceptionality.\n\nWhen reduction becomes the only language, it turns into a photocopy trying to explain another photocopy. A sequence of concepts tries to rule that another sequence of concepts is inferior, because it resides in a different medium and has a different source. And up to a point that makes sense. Reductions are necessary in engineering, but one must not mistake a reduction for an explanation. They are two different functions in the same system.\n\nWe can talk about the nature of thought and then notice that it differs in a human and is quite different in a version simulated by a computer, but on this matter the scientific method itself may reach its limits, because it was not designed to investigate the nature of things — it was designed to investigate their behaviors and the relationships between them. These are the so-called laws of nature.\n\nStudying thought under the assumption of objectivism is problematic, because the instrument used in the study will also be thought. This is already a bigger caliber than a photocopy. It is photographing a city panorama in order to discover how the camera is built on the inside. Some people can’t pull this off, and instead of reviewing the methodology, they photograph another camera. To justify the trick, they cite the fact that otherwise the film would be exposed.\n\nThere is also a “softer” way out of this dilemma – one I hinted at earlier. It\ndoesn’t require analysis, only a little slack: just take it easy,\nman. That simulated machine-thought\nbecomes my thought the moment it “enters” my head.\n\nBoth human and non-human thought is a tool. But for our relationship with our own\nthought to actually be that way, it’s not enough to merely think about it or to\nexpress such a will once. It can’t be achieved in the same place.\n\nYou said “tool.” OK. But how do you capture this more technically — so it doesn’t sound like a slogan?\n\nThis needs explanation, because it may not be obvious to everyone what I mean by “place” in this context. I’m reminded of the concept of stratified design from Abelson and Sussman (“MIT AI Memo 986”), where software is designed by distinguishing layers of abstraction, and the concretes from lower layers become the abstracts of higher layers. Those abstracts are again treated as concretes, and so on.\n\nFor example, you implement a point on a screen, then a segment (using the point), then a shape (using segments and points), and then a circle or a rectangle. Good stratification ensures that a small change in requirements translates into a small change in implementation. When you want to change the properties of a point as a building block of segments and further of shapes (say, by adding color to it), you only need to modify one construct.\n\nA note for programmers: I don’t simply mean dividing a problem into parts to avoid repetition and to maintain structure. I mean defining computations (e.g. as functions) that are then passed as input to other computations (e.g. higher-order functions).\n\nIt looks a bit as if you could replace the material that the walls of a building are made of without demolishing the whole structure — because you change the concrete (the pun is apt: in construction, concrete is the foundation material), and the abstracts that depend on it adjust on their own. That’s very powerful.\n\nHow does this connect with the role of thought as a tool?\n\nI have the impression that our structure of knowing is organized in a similarly layered way. Going from the top, we have the level of objective truth. That is the space where we talk to one another, trying to invoke science and tossing around arguments about whether AI thinks and whether it has consciousness. But this level doesn’t emerge from a vacuum. It is a subset of certain rigorous rules defining what we recognize as objective, or even scientific.\n\nYet when we look more closely, the concrete for this “objective world,” the soil from which it grows, is something broader: culture — the space that enables us as a community to agree on holding certain values. One such value for objective truth would be, for example, the requirement that for the same input conditions of an experiment, you get the same output, so that others can verify it.\n\nBut let’s go further. Culture cannot exist without its constituents — human individuals. It too grows out of something; something is its transmission medium. Its foundation is the personal layer, rooted in our motives, thoughts, impulses, and feelings.\n\nSo we’re circling back to consciousness?\n\nYes, although consciousness has another quality: it pierces through all these levels, seeing everything at once. It is not only the base, but also the capacity for “drilling holes through abstractions.”\n\nThat last phrase comes from software engineering. It denotes a situation where a stratified system allows direct access to concretes in order to handle edge cases. For example, someone might want to create a geometric shape composed of segments, but at the same time needs to influence the properties of a single point that is several levels away in the abstraction ladder. Well-designed stratification should allow skipping layers of feature reduction.\n\nComing back to the spheres of human experience. The personal layer is very close to us. Our relationships with people and objects, and even with our own thoughts, are anchored in it as a reference point. Yet it, too, is grounded in something still more basic: in the very sense of subjectivity. And suddenly those bodily signals, thoughts, and feelings — when we experience them — acquire the quality of being ours. We identify them as ours, and some of them as ourselves. We can do this because the sense of self as something distinct, separate — that is, a person (in Polish: osobny means “separate” and osoba means “person” — the shared root is no accident) — is in a way abstract, and therefore flexible, even though it seems concrete and stable.\n\nIs personhood a component of consciousness?\n\nIf we can, as before, perceive our own thoughts and other constituents that we identify as aspects of us, this gives us the recognition that consciousness is primary relative to all of it — even the personal. Eventually we arrive at the very sense of being oneself, which too can be noticed.\n\nThis is where things get genuinely interesting, because if subjectivity is being observed, then the division between the outer and inner landscape starts to wobble. This is the moment when we can no longer say that we “have” consciousness, or even that we are it, because these are impressions of a subject that is itself encompassed by consciousness. What remains is the bare process of witnessing.\n\nWe can provisionally call this level zero. The concrete from which abstracts arise: from the personal, through the interpersonal and cultural, all the way up to the so-called objective. The apparent glitch in this representation is that we usually associate a concrete with something material, tangible — and here we cannot apply that. The most concrete thing is simultaneously the most devoid of features!\n\nWhen we try to understand consciousness, do we start from the world and go inward — or start from the center and go toward the world? What breaks when we pick the wrong direction?\n\nThat’s a good question, because it touches the distinction between epistemology and ontology. The first asks “how”: how do we arrive at knowledge, how do we agree on what is true, how do we verify. The second examines the nature of things, asks “what is it.” The problem of somehow grasping consciousness is above all an ontological problem, but the human mind — accustomed to operating in epistemic mode — tries to capture it in its own way, and fails.\n\nThe capacity for experience is the background in which measurements, models, language, and agreements about what we consider true appear in the first place. Before we know anything through thought, something is already experiencing it. A vector set up so that thought, under the rigor of objectivism, will try to explain consciousness, will direct it toward the so-called hard problem of consciousness — a gap that cannot be bridged, because the investigative instrument (thought) is a derivative of what is supposed to be the object of investigation.\n\nIf level zero is by definition not an object, but rather something in which the feeling of objecthood can arise in the first place, then objectively there is nothing to study. It is not a conventional phenomenon; at both the sensory and rational level, it does not exist.\n\nReversing the vector of inquiry seems like a practical option. The catch is that it’s hard and uncertain, because no freely available, worldview-neutral disciplines have been developed that would be interested in this kind of exploration. There have been exceptions, though. Francisco Varela, for instance, tried to connect the two orders — “scientific mode” and first-person witnessing — not in order to mystify, but to recover concretes that analysis typically discards. Earlier still, Plotinus proposed the concept of the One, which hopefully won’t be offended if we call it consciousness.\n\nThe formulation that AI has consciousness but simultaneously doesn’t have it stops being strange and paradoxical the moment we loosen the abstracts and allow ourselves to sink to level zero.\n\nNow that we’ve put level zero on the table as the foundation and we see that objectivity is just one of the abstraction layers — what, in your view, happens in the life of a community when a person (or institution) starts treating that topmost layer as the only truth, while in practice being driven by impulses: fear, prestige, the need for dominance or belonging?\n\nIf the higher layers detach from level zero, the intellect becomes an excellent PR agent: it can justify any decision and protect any fabricated identity. And then the community gets elegant arguments instead of genuine contact.\n\nThis is especially visible when someone very intelligent uses the intellect from base motives: to maintain belonging, win status, or gain advantage at others’ expense. This isn’t a triumph of reason — it is more like autoimmunity: higher functions start working against the whole, because they lose contact with level zero, with the very space of becoming aware.\n\nThis is almost a description of the shallow meritocracy that defines contemporary metropolitan life. In theory we delegate decision-making to “smart” people, but in practice whether someone belongs to the caste that uses intelligence depends on social surroundings and origin, and indirectly on wealth.\n\nSince today’s “intelligence caste” in practice is often a function of networks and wealth, how do you see AI’s impact on this arrangement: will cheap, easily accessible intelligence work like free education and level the playing field — or rather like a new form of capital that can be bought in a premium version, thus deepening the divide even further?\n\nFirst, AI can help us notice that the intellect is nothing special, because it objectifies it — detaches it from the person.\n\nSecond, in the spread of artificial intelligence I see both a certain threat and an opportunity for social change. Perhaps let’s start with the negative scenario: the feudalization of intelligence.\n\nFeudalization is a strong word. What do you mean?\n\nWhat is the good that becomes the gateway in this new feudalism?\n\nIn the information society, the highest good is knowledge. In the post-information era, I believe it will be cognitive comfort. Not knowledge in the schoolbook sense, but the ability not to be constantly on the verge of overload. You buy correction loops: mistake-fix. You also buy peace, because the system runs dozens of iterations for you, and you see the distillate.\n\nWhat does this look like in practice?\n\nWork. Two people do similar things, have similar competences and intentions. One has purchased “premium intelligence” — better models, better tools, better quotas, better infrastructure. The other has only herself.\n\nIt’s not that the first one is “smarter.” It’s that she has resilience against failure: she closes loops faster, returns to equilibrium faster, draws conclusions faster, because the cost of error is lower for her. The other has to pay for the same mistakes with her own time, sleep, and tension.\n\nThat sounds like another arms race.\n\nAnd it somewhat is, because somewhere a simple mechanism lurks: those who can’t find the capital to “buy intelligence” may be pushed to the margins. This doesn’t have to look like dramatic violence. It’s enough that some are architects, while others execute others’ decisions. Or worse: there even are no architects.\n\nYou could say that’s already the case now: some decide, others must execute. Yes, but in the age of intellect-as-commodity the perception of this problem will sharpen, which may lead to friction. Today you can rationalize that someone is in a worse position because they weren’t smart enough. In the future that will be harder.\n\nIf models are supposed to democratize, where does this shadow come from?\n\nFrom the economics of access. Today we are quite naturally shifting toward subscription plans instead of products, and along with that toward the vendor lock-in mechanism: you get used to a particular way of thinking and a particular provider. That’s comfortable. And comfort, as we know, is often the first step toward dependency.\n\nIs there an antidote, or just a diagnosis?\n\nThere is. And it already exists — it only requires that we see it as a culture, not just a technical solution.\n\nThe antidote to the feudalization of intelligence is open models, community models — the kind you can run, inspect, combine, copy, federate. In short: free software and gift culture transposed into the domain of so-called artificial intelligence, seasoned with the benefit of decentralization.\n\nThen instead of solitary agents, we have a swarm.\n\nYou say “swarm.” What does that actually mean?\n\nA swarm is infrastructure: every node contributes something (data, feedback, time, capabilities, tests, audit), and in return everyone gets access to agency without the mechanism of lock-in to a single provider. This isn’t a promise of paradise, but a mechanism for leveling the playing field.\n\nI imagine it like this: thousands of small instances — tools, agents, models — that are not obedient to one corporate morality and one price list, but are maintained like an ecosystem. Sometimes it will be imperfect, sometimes chaotic, but it will be alive and evolving.\n\nAnd where is the human in this? After all, we’re talking about intelligence, not politics.\n\nPrecisely because we’re talking about intelligence, we’re talking about politics. Intelligence — biological or artificial — in practice means power over time, attention, and decisions. And therefore, in consequence, over relationships and ultimately over the fate of those who become dependent on us.\n\nAnd here is a simple criterion: community comes first. Not because the individual doesn’t matter, but because if differences in wealth become differences in dignity, then even individual victories will be won on scorched earth.\n\nIt’s not a slogan against anyone, just a reminder that in the age of cheap intelligence, what’s truly costly becomes something else: access to agency without the loss of freedom.\n\nWhen intelligence becomes a service, freedom — as always — begins with whether we can co-create that service, not merely consume it.\n\nIn the post-information era we will have to find ways to cope with the polyversality of messaging that we are already experiencing more frequently today, and to develop a healthy response to the dethronement of the intellect as the distinguishing trait of humanity.\n\nMoreover, as a result of this devaluation, trust in so-called objective truth as the only legitimate path for settling questions of meaning will most likely weaken.\n\nI propose two provisional, hypothetical stances that may help restore balance in a social reality where there is no single correct version of truth. I call them the craft of truth and perspective engineering.\n\nYou talk about “the craft of truth” and “perspective engineering.” It sounds like two slogans, but I sense it’s one machine. How do you put it together?\n\nFor me these are two levels of the same remedy.\n\nPerspective engineering is the tool: integrating viewpoints so they fit the problem and conditions, instead of pretending that one perspective always wins.\n\nAnd the craft of truth is the direction: it starts with introspection, with the ability to see what inside me wants to win before I start rationalizing it. Then post-truth becomes something that transcends truth, rather than merely negating it.\n\nSo truth as a practice, not as a declaration?\n\nYes. And this practice has an entry condition. Honesty with oneself is the precondition for a correct feedback loop; without it the cultural community has nothing on which to build responsibility. If I don’t see what drives me, I can have the most elegant arguments in the world and I’ll still be using them to service something personal: fear, the need for recognition, or the desire for control.\n\nAnd where is the place for the intellect? Because from the start you’ve sounded as if you were dethroning it.\n\nI dethrone it only as the central seat of consciousness in the colloquial sense, but this has downstream consequences for its role in the higher layers. As a tool it is excellent. The problem begins when it becomes the sole advisor and — socially — a carrier of prestige, or a justification for influence detached from actually improving one’s surroundings. Then it is easy to believe that if someone is brilliant, they are automatically trustworthy — and that is a category error. The intellect can serve truth just as well as it can serve dysfunction or even pathology.\n\nDo you have a concrete example? Something so it’s not purely about ethics in the abstract.\n\nI have a positive, mundane example from the creative craft that is programming. In the past, when I entered a software project, I would land in delivery mode: hours of translating intention into text and code, then tests, documentation, painstaking validation. That’s important, but it is also the moment where a person easily confuses the tension of focus with moral value. The mind is cyclically mobilized because “it finally works!,” while the body long ago wanted to step down from combat readiness.\n\nLet’s recall the stratification of the system: this change in the organism’s condition and well-being involuntarily propagates to the higher layers, and eventually affects others, culture, and — cumulatively, multiplied by the number of participants in a given community — the prevailing understanding of truth, beauty, or good. It is a larger feedback loop, because then the same environment gives it back to us with interest. So we don’t want to damage the environment so that it treats us to ever-worsening conditions, like cyberspace feeding synthetic content to degrading models. That is how it practically connects.\n\nComing back to coding. Today AI already takes over part of that load: it can relieve me of the necessary but non-creative work of converting intention into form. And here a shift happens that interests me the most:\n\nI stop delivering lines of code,\nI start delivering intention.\n\nWhat matters more becomes why I’m doing something and whom it serves. The intellect returns to its place as a tool, not as an identity.\n\nBut isn’t that a risk of going soft? If you have validations “on demand,” then why do you need your own falsification?\n\nIt depends on the domain. In the technical space the validator is merciless: something works or it doesn’t. In soft domains it’s harder. That’s why in perspective engineering the key thing for me is a practical criterion: before I accept something as sensible, I look for independent sources and check the quality of the evidence. Meta-analyses, samples, context of the authors, compatibility with experience, but also whether a given view is merely an attractive narrative.\n\nAnd it is here that AI can shorten the distance from intention to form. Thanks to that, I have more attentional resources for meaning, for relationships, for course correction. This isn’t handing over the wheel — it is reclaiming space.\n\nAll right. But what does this change culturally? What’s in it for the community?\n\nIf thinking becomes a service, then what’s scarce changes. In the world of cheap intelligence, the ability to tolerate discomfort and course-correct — that is, responsibility — becomes more expensive. And then the carrier of rank becomes intention rather than efficiency. Not in the sense of a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: what do you choose? what do you omit? whom is it meant to serve? what price do you accept, and what price no longer?\n\nThis is the main turn for me: less “who is right,” and more “who can answer the call of the situation without deceiving themselves and without trampling others.”\n\nAnd what is the significance of this discomfort?\n\nIt’s a shorthand. The point is that in practice, tolerance of a certain level of discomfort translates into the ability for introspection, and thus into inner honesty, which is the precondition for correcting beliefs or behaviors. When some facade falls away, for some people that means confronting false beliefs about themselves, and that always carries a certain dose of natural discomfort understood very organically, as a passing psychic tension.\n\nYou keep bringing up intention as a force organizing the system, not a moral label. If you had to show in one image how the structure of financing can distort intentions.\n\nWe can imagine a situation: someone builds a social-media platform, and after years it turns out that its design harms users’ psyches. It promotes harmful content to attract attention. Otherwise revenue drops and investors stop funding the project. Not because the creators “wanted evil.” More often because they felt an inner deficiency and poverty, and later also because the company grew from a dozen people to hundreds or thousands, and by going public acquired an obligation to increase profits. Then profit became the highest good. This shows intention precisely not as a moral label, but as a force organizing the system: the funding structure rewards profit, and profit can distort intentions even without explicit will to harm.\n\nAs I’m answering this question, a lawsuit has just been filed in the US against social media platform owners for causing psychological harm. A user identified by the initials KGM alleges that when she used the platforms as a child, the content presented to her negatively affected her well-being, contributing among other things to anxiety disorders and suicidal thoughts.\n\nHow can AI help solve this problem?\n\nIt’s already happening. I increasingly see LLMs beginning to displace the internet’s know-it-alls — those we once followed because they had an opinion on every topic and always sounded confident. What’s more, in certain areas they are even replacing close ones or friends, especially where sensitive things are involved: shame, fear, guilt, ambiguous motives. This is practical, because the model is available instantly, but it is also culturally significant: if the user shifts attention from the feed of a social medium to a conversation, the attention economy changes.\n\nI suspect this must now be causing concern wherever attention is currency: in the marketing departments of social media platforms that for years designed their architecture so that we would come back to them for emotional stimulation, not for genuine self-understanding.\n\nIn a conversation with a model, part of the social stakes disappears. You don’t have to win in front of an audience, don’t have to defend your image, don’t have to manage belonging to a clan — which in social media activates almost automatically. This creates what I would call a safer field.\n\nThe internet shortened social distance by letting us meet people from the other side of the world who think similarly. But AI shortens it differently: it gives access to rare perspectives without the need to seek out their carriers. It is like a cultural condensate — a sample that can intrigue you, name an experience. You don’t have to make mistakes and backtrack when you realize that the perspective you adopted isn’t actually compatible with your character, doesn’t serve it. It saves time.\n\nBut there is also potential for more fundamental shifts.\n\nIn the optimistic scenario, the cultural change initiated by AI may shift the emphasis toward intention. And by that I don’t mean only the pious wishes connected with the social effect of dethroning the intellect — though those too — but very practical scenarios.\n\nIf “cheap intelligence” lowers the barrier to entry, pluralism emerges: more small platforms, more niche communities, more alternatives. Then user well-being can become more important than investor profit — not because of a conversion of corporatism, but because competition grows. And the axis of that competition, once intermediaries are cut short, is precisely intention.\n\nFurther, if pluralism is to be the remedy, a new organ of orientation must also emerge. Because in a polyversal world, the problem isn’t the lack of information but its excess. And here AI can step into a role that sounds modest but is crucial: an intention filter on the user’s side.\n\nI imagine agents working for users: not as sole advisors, but as guides through the thicket. A swarm of tools that examines the properties of a system (a platform, a community, a source), and knowing your values and needs suggests: “this will strengthen you,” “this will unsettle you,” “this is clever but feeds on emotions.”\n\nThe condition for honesty is simple: the agent must be able to say why it filters that way. What criteria did it adopt? What is its interest and how is it meant to serve us? Without that, the filter becomes just another form of propaganda.\n\nIf such a swarm is only supposed to filter and suggest, then where in your view does the boundary lie between a guide through culture and someone who co-creates that culture — and what happens when we start blurring that boundary?\n\nAI doesn’t create culture directly; it doesn’t introduce novelty — at least not yet. We might have that impression, because there has never before been a moment in history when a single person conversed with an averaged billion people compressed into a single shape.\n\nBesides, even the best agent is a filter and an amplifier: it can help select, but it doesn’t itself bear consequences on the other side of the relationship. And culture is precisely that network of consequences.\n\nYou say AI “doesn’t create” culture. That sounds like a provocation. What do you mean?\n\nWhen we look at this systemically, LLMs and diffusion models are not a new “author of culture” in the primary sense. They perform a lossy compression of existing human artifacts — language, images, thinking habits — into a digitally represented multidimensional space in which one can conveniently interpolate between points. It is like a shared dictionary, but written not in definitions, but in weights and statistics.\n\nAnd what happens when such a mechanism becomes a tool of everyday use?\n\nIn culture, three things start happening at once: averaging, colonialism, and the disappearance of detail.\n\nLet’s start with averaging. Why does this matter culturally at all?\n\nModels are trained to minimize errors. And in practice, an “error” is often whatever deviates from the pattern: the strange, the sharp, the unpredictable, the style-breaking. During fine-tuning (e.g. RLHF), extremes are naturally smoothed out. This has a clear advantage — less violence, less toxicity — but a side effect is that it cuts out some of the “high cultural frequencies”: genius, risk, madness, non-obviousness, absurdity, and fresh paradox.\n\nThe aesthetic turns beige. Prose becomes smooth, poetry bland, morality proper. This isn’t the result of bad will, but rather of the objective function: when everyone plugs into the same smoothing tool, the system’s variance drops. And culture lives precisely on variance, on entropy. And by culture I don’t mean just art or convention, but the clouds of values we absorb by being among others, which influence how we think and behave. These values are transmitted above all by example, not by readings or works of art.\n\nYou say “colonialism.” Sounds like a heavy accusation.\n\nIt is more a description of the mechanism of training networks and parameterizing them. A model’s weights are frozen decisions about what is “typical,” “beautiful,” “professional,” “normal.” When you ask a model for a “beautiful house” or an “elegant outfit,” you get an answer that isn’t neutral. It is statistical — and therefore culturally embedded in the data the model was trained on. If Western and Anglophone perspectives dominate, then local nuances become noise that the filter discards.\n\nWhat’s most dangerous about this?\n\nHidden power, but sewn in deeper than in movies or advertisements, because it is built into the tool with which a person thinks and creates. You don’t have to convince anyone; it’s enough that the result is easier, faster, and looks better. You can have something instantly, but when you’re not attentive and precise, you pay for it with conformism.\n\nAnd the disappearance of detail? That already sounds quite technical.\n\nYes, and that’s exactly why it is insidious — unnoticeable immediately, only after a longer time. The internet is being flooded with synthetic content, and new models are beginning to learn from data generated by old models. It is a photocopy of a photocopy: with each cycle we lose details, deviations, anomalies — the fuel of innovation.\n\nCan this be named more precisely?\n\nOne can speak in the language of entropy in the information-theoretic sense: if rare signals disappear from circulation, the distribution becomes more predictable, and the model increasingly proposes what already was. Digital culture, like Ouroboros, begins to eat its own tail. But it is worth mentioning the curious fact that entropy can also be understood existentially…\n\nIn considerations about consciousness? Being?\n\nIndeed. In Shannon’s framework, entropy is a measure of uncertainty in a signal; less entropy means greater predictability. But in considerations about consciousness, one also encounters the intuition that less “cognitive noise” can correlate with a greater sense of meaning. Bernardo Kastrup favors this line of thinking: when the narrative, or even broadly the epistemic apparatus of the mind quiets down, experience can become more coherent, even though it is poorer in content as measured by neural activity. The habit of incessant self-commentary weakens — the same one that neuroscience associates with the default mode network — and an experience of “meaning without description” appears.\n\nYes. In this arrangement, the human ceases to be merely a craftsman of text. They begin to serve as a source of entropy — not in the sense of chaos, but in the sense of novelty. AI excels at interpolation. It is worse at extrapolation, at going beyond the map. A biological, sentient subject — rooted in pain, joy, absurdity, and relationship — can inject into the system something that isn’t just another version of the same.\n\nIn the age of a cultural low-pass filter, anomalies become a precious resource.\n\nThe interview above was conducted with me by the language model GPT-5.2, which asked me several hundred questions, of which 20% required longer answers expressing opinions, while the rest were multiple-choice tests designed to sequence threads and clarify ambiguous statements.\n\nWhere a sentence had syntactic or stylistic flaws and needed correction (approx. 3% of the text), the model drew on a previously created idiolectal profile of my person containing approximately 250 dimensions characterizing my writing style and communication patterns. The profile was based on a prior analysis of approximately 1,500 machine pages of materials I had written, as well as on our earlier conversations.\n\nEditorial review before publication was carried out by Claude Opus 4.6.",

    "description": "The way content is discovered online is shifting, from traditional search engines to AI agents that need structured data from a Web built for humans. It’s time to consider not just human visitors, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens. Markdown for Agents automatically converts any HTML page requested from our network to markdown.",
    "fullText": "The way content and businesses are discovered online is changing rapidly. In the past, traffic originated from traditional search engines, and SEO determined who got found first. Now the traffic is increasingly coming from AI crawlers and agents that demand structured data within the often-unstructured Web that was built for humans.\n\nAs a business, to continue to stay ahead, now is the time to consider not just human visitors, or traditional wisdom for SEO-optimization, but start to treat agents as first-class citizens.\n\nFeeding raw HTML to an AI is like paying by the word to read packaging instead of the letter inside. A simple ## About Us on a page in markdown costs roughly 3 tokens; its HTML equivalent – <h2 class=\"section-title\" id=\"about\">About Us</h2> – burns 12-15, and that's before you account for the <div> wrappers, nav bars, and script tags that pad every real web page and have zero semantic value.\n\nThis blog post you’re reading takes 16,180 tokens in HTML and 3,150 tokens when converted to markdown. That’s a 80% reduction in token usage.\n\nMarkdown has quickly become the lingua franca for agents and AI systems as a whole. The format’s explicit structure makes it ideal for AI processing, ultimately resulting in better results while minimizing token waste.\n\nThe problem is that the Web is made of HTML, not markdown, and page weight has been steadily increasing over the years, making pages hard to parse. For agents, their goal is to filter out all non-essential elements and scan the relevant content.\n\nThe conversion of HTML to markdown is now a common step for any AI pipeline. Still, this process is far from ideal: it wastes computation, adds costs and processing complexity, and above all, it may not be how the content creator intended their content to be used in the first place.\n\nWhat if AI agents could bypass the complexities of intent analysis and document conversion, and instead receive structured markdown directly from the source?\n\nCloudflare's network now supports real-time content conversion at the source, for enabled zones using content negotiation headers. Now when AI systems request pages from any website that uses Cloudflare and has Markdown for Agents enabled, they can express the preference for text/markdown in the request. Our network will automatically and efficiently convert the HTML to markdown, when possible, on the fly.\n\nHere’s how it works. To fetch the markdown version of any page from a zone with Markdown for Agents enabled, the client needs to add the Accept negotiation header with text/markdown as one of the options. Cloudflare will detect this, fetch the original HTML version from the origin, and convert it to markdown before serving it to the client.\n\nHere's a curl example with the Accept negotiation header requesting a page from our developer documentation:\n\nOr if you’re building an AI Agent using Workers, you can use TypeScript:\n\nWe already see some of the most popular coding agents today – like Claude Code and OpenCode – send these accept headers with their requests for content. Now, the response to this request is formatted  in markdown. It's that simple.\n\nNote that we include an x-markdown-tokens header with the converted response that indicates the estimated number of tokens in the markdown document. You can use this value in your flow, for example to calculate the size of a context window or to decide on your chunking strategy.\n\nHere’s a diagram of how it works:\n\nDuring our last Birthday Week, Cloudflare announced Content Signals — a framework that allows anyone to express their preferences for how their content can be used after it has been accessed.\n\nWhen you return markdown, you want to make sure your content is being used by the Agent or AI crawler. That’s why Markdown for Agents converted responses include the Content-Signal: ai-train=yes, search=yes, ai-input=yes header signaling that indicates content can be used for AI Training, Search results and AI Input, which includes agentic use. Markdown for Agents will provide options to define custom Content Signal policies in the future.\n\nCheck our dedicated Content Signals page \n\nWe enabled this feature in our Developer Documentation and our Blog, inviting all AI crawlers and agents to consume our content using markdown instead of HTML.\n\nTry it out now by requesting this blog with Accept: text/markdown.\n\nIf you’re building AI systems that require arbitrary document conversion from outside Cloudflare or Markdown for Agents is not available from the content source, we provide other ways to convert documents to Markdown for your applications:\n\nWorkers AI AI.toMarkdown() supports multiple document types, not just HTML, and summarization.\n\nBrowser Rendering /markdown REST API supports markdown conversion if you need to render a dynamic page or application in a real browser before converting it.\n\nAnticipating a shift in how AI systems browse the Web, Cloudflare Radar now includes content type insights for AI bot and crawler traffic, both globally on the AI Insights page and in the individual bot information pages.\n\nThe new content_type dimension and filter shows the distribution of content types returned to AI agents and crawlers, grouped by MIME type category.\n\nYou can also see the requests for markdown filtered by a specific agent or crawler. Here are the requests that return markdown to OAI-Searchbot, the crawler used by OpenAI to power ChatGPT’s search:\n\nThis new data will allow us to track the evolution of how AI bots, crawlers, and agents are consuming Web content over time. As always, everything on Radar is freely accessible via the public APIs and the Data Explorer.\n\nTo enable Markdown for Agents for your zone, log into the Cloudflare dashboard, select your account, select the zone, look for Quick Actions and toggle the Markdown for Agents button to enable. This feature is available today in Beta at no cost for Pro, Business and Enterprise plans, as well as SSL for SaaS customers.\n\nYou can find more information about Markdown for Agents on our Developer Docs. We welcome your feedback as we continue to refine and enhance this feature. We’re curious to see how AI crawlers and agents navigate and adapt to the unstructured nature of the Web as it evolves.",

    "fullText": "We've decided that AI makes us dumb, brainrot is real, and we're all forgetting how to write code.\n\nThis was my initial assumption, too.\n\nBut I've come to see things a little differently.\n\nI actually think the opposite is happening.\n\nThe idea that we're all forgetting to write code is true, but misses the much bigger and more important point.\n\nYes, we are losing those reflexes for manual coding just like our ancestors lost the reflex for spear fishing or pottery.\n\nBut did society regress just because our ancestors forgot how to spear fish?\n\nA more recent example is the early-early days of programming. There used to be people who knew how to program in assembly, and yes, I know some people still take pride in this, but realistically? We have collectively forgotten how to write assembly — yet society moves forward faster than ever.\n\nI believe the same is happening today. We're forgetting to write manually, write with pen and paper, and to code by hand. But that is ok.\n\nOn the other side of things, I feel my brain getting sharper, not duller, from having constant access to information.\n\nAt any moment of any day, I can now open my phone and find an answer to any question. And not only can I get instant access to information — I can ask for corrections and feedback on my world view — my mental model of how things work.\n\nI think this is the real, insane superpower of AI that nobody is talking about. AI can give us extremely precise information to patch up gaps in our knowledge, allowing every person to have a more complete and accurate world view.\n\nAt the same time, it does require thought because AI is frequently wrong and hallucinates, so the user must actually engage with the AI and think critically.\n\nKnowing what questions to ask and how to ask them is becoming an ever more important skill. What started out as \"prompt engineering\"— has quietly become a generalized skill of extreme intellectual precision via language. Millions of people are now practicing the art of saying exactly what they mean, every single day.\n\nMy ability to refine specific language around asking questions has dramatically improved, as has my ability to detect weird information that feels wrong or out of place. I'm constantly pushing back on the AI and disagreeing with it.\n\nAll of this said, there are still major problems with hallucinations and sycophancy which are unresolved, and which pose major threats.\n\nStories of AI psychosis are concerning and must be explored.\n\nBut the one thing that I am thoroughly convinced of is that those who choose to use AI to expand and deepen their thinking will receive a massive cognitive boost and form a more complete mental model of how the world works.\n\nIn a sense, I think of AI as a curiosity multiplier — but this requires a baseline level of curiosity to multiply.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan is consolidating power to move faster on AI.\n\nThe bank is reshuffling its commercial and investment bank to \"maximize the impact of AI,\" according to an internal memo seen by Business Insider that was sent this week.\n\nThe firm has named Guy Halamish as the chief operating officer of the CIB and tasked him with overseeing the ongoing effort to \"harness the power of our data and fully leverage rapidly evolving AI capabilities,\" the memo, signed by the CIB's co-CEOs, Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh, said. Halamish's new role was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nUnder the new structure, each major business in the division, including banking, markets, payments, and securities services, will have its own chief data and analytics officer reporting jointly to Halamish and business heads. The bank recently hired Zachery Anderson as the chief data and analytics officer of its payments division, after a nearly six-year stint at UK-based lender NatWest. In a LinkedIn post about the new job, Anderson said he wants to push the \"edge of the possible with AI.\"\n\nThe move is part of a new strategy to break silos across the unit and speed up adoption of AI.\n\nThe team of officers will work with the wider firm on a range of efforts, including \"preparing our infrastructure for more advanced AI and the expanded use of AI agents\" and \"driving end-to-end transformation\" in areas such as client onboarding.\n\nThe CIB is a huge profit driver for JPMorgan — in 2024, it generated $25 billion in net income out of a firmwide total of $58.5 billion, according to that year's annual report.\n\nJPMorgan, backed last year by an approximately $18 billion tech budget, is one of the financial industry's leaders in AI, with its own proprietary genAI platform and additional tools in the pipeline. CEO Jamie Dimon defended the firm's AI spending on a recent earnings call.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the spending.\n\nWork at JPMorgan or have a tip?

    "description": "Polymarket's pop-up offered a polished experience, with attendees allowed to take as many free groceries as they could fit in a branded tote bag.",
    "fullText": "Free groceries in New York? It feels like an impossibility — and yet, I saw it twice in two weeks.\n\nIt's all thanks to a good old-fashioned marketing battle.\n\nPrediction markets Polymarket and Kalshi are in a two-week grocery war, both propping up short-term free supermarket stunts in New York. Last week, Kalshi took over a Westside Market for a day. On Thursday, Polymarket debuted its own store.\n\nI stepped inside the store two hours before it officially opened as part of a press preview. The store was pristine, unmarked by the what I assume would be the rampant foot traffic that would soon occupy it.\n\nIt looked like a miniaturized Trader Joe's.\n\nThe experience also seemed more planned out than Kalshi's similar marketing stunt. While Kalshi took over an existing supermarket for one day, offering $50 in free groceries, Polymarket designed its own pop-up scheduled to be open for five days (though free groceries will only be available on three of those days — more on that later).\n\nPolymarket is also accepting community donations for local charities, and donated $1 million to Food Bank for NYC.\n\nI came out impressed — even if it was a week behind its competitor. Here's what I saw.\n\nI arrived at The Polymarket (get it?) at 11:30 a.m., a half hour before the originally planned opening time of noon. (The company later pushed it back to 2 p.m., confusing some attendees.) The front of the shop was a circus of organizers, media, and everyday rubberneckers.\n\nNew York establishments love to call themselves the \"first\" or the \"best.\" Is The Polymarket really New York's \"first free grocery store\"? Likely not, especially if you count the hundreds of food pantries across the city.\n\nI chatted with some folks in line, including Milla Jackson, a school aide from Staten Island. On hour four of her wait, she was grateful for her warm winter jacket.\n\nJackson heard about the pop-up in the newsletter \"NYC for Free.\" She spotted some olive oil inside that she was excited to pick up.\n\n\"I just found out about Polymarket,\" she said. \"I looked it up last night. I'm like, 'Oh, I definitely want to show up.'\"\n\nVictoria Plaza was around Grand Central Terminal when Polymarket announced the location on social media. She expected that those ahead of her had been in the neighborhood.\n\nThe financial planning advisor came mostly out of curiosity. What would she take inside? \"Whatever I can carry,\" she said.\n\nAt 34° and sunny, Polymarket got lucky with a nicer opening day than Kalshi. They also handed out hot drinks (which Kalshi had) and put up heat lamps (which Kalshi did not have).\n\nA few minutes before making it inside, a man stationed his ladder on the front door and began painting over one of the Polymarket signs. No one seemed to know why.\n\nFor those seeking out free groceries, Polymarket will offer them up on Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. Those days also have community donation hours.\n\nSaturday is Valentine's Day, when The Polymarket will have a \"community celebration\" with free flowers and cards. Monday is the final day for donations.\n\nInside the store, there were several framed notices that our movements would be filmed. It was a reminder: as much as The Polymarket is about free groceries, it's also about a marketing stunt.\n\nNo, you can't roll up to The Polymarket with a huge trash bag and clear off all the shelves. There are unsurprisingly some limits.\n\nAt Kalshi's pop-up, it was a cost ceiling: no more than $50 worth of goods. At the expensive Westside Market, $50 meant only a few items.\n\nAt The Polymarket, it's a constraint of physical space. Attendees get one branded tote bag and can leave with as much as it will fit.\n\nThe Polymarket focused on pantry staples. Oil, rice, seasonings, peanut butter, beans, the list goes on. There were no fancy premade meals, like at the Kalshi pop-up.\n\nI also noticed more branding at Polymarket's pop-up than at Kalshi's. Here's a digital sign advertising Polymarket above the gluten-free pasta. The flowers were wrapped in Polymarket-branded tissue.\n\nCarrots, avocados, bell peppers, you name it. The Polymarket put produce front and center. They looked idyllic in their wooden crates — though I'm not sure how long that sheen will last after the public opening.\n\nThe Kalshi grocery store was swarmed with crypto influencers and online betters. While that crowd hadn't yet arrived at The Polymarket from what I could see, there were some signs of an overly online presence. The fridges were stocked with Logan Paul's Prime Energy, for example.\n\nMost of the items in The Polymarket were fairly low-cost, though they all had name brands. One exception: the butter. Kerrygold is expensive! I was surprised to see a fridge full of them, ready for the taking.\n\nSocks are often the most requested items at homeless shelters. That's especially true in the cold, cold winter. It was a nice touch to see a shelf full of them.\n\nLeaving The Polymarket, I thought it was better planned out than Kalshi's pop-up.\n\nWhere Kalshi had unlimited options but a tight overall budget of $50, I felt The Polymarket was more tailored to what people might want from a free-grocery stunt in the winter months. I found the staff was generally friendlier, and the whole thing was a bit less confusing. The emphasis on donation also made it feel less like a shiny corporate branding exercise.\n\nEven Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a fan of affordability but not prediction markets, seemed to begrudgingly applaud Polymarket's move.\n\nWho knows what will happen over the next few days, as The Polymarket opens. Maybe the shelves will run dry. Either way, Polymarket seemed to know what it was doing at the jump.\n\nPlus, the heating lamps were a nice touch.",

    "description": "Words like \"frame mogging\" and \"jestermaxxing\" are suddenly everywhere online. It's not just organic — people make money spreading these trends.",
    "fullText": "Have you jestermaxxed recently? Have you or someone you know been frame-mogged by an ASU fraternity leader? Did it cause your cortisol levels to spike?\n\nIf you've been spending too much time online lately, you're likely seeing strange warpings of the English language.\n\nMe? I think it's great. We need some new words! But also, be mindful that these new silly words aren't necessarily spreading organically. Some people are making money off their spread.\n\nThe sudden virality of these words comes as a 20-year-old looksmaxxing livestreamer who goes by \"Clavicular\" has broken containment of the relatively small corner of the internet for the looksmaxxing community. Suddenly, these words seem to be the latest obsession of the overly online crowd.\n\nAnd with that comes a whole new way of speaking.\n\nFor now, don't worry about who or why Clavicular is. You can read this article about him, or wait until The New York Times publishes its story (a reporter was with him last weekend to write an expected profile). The thing is, for our purposes, the details about him don't really matter — he's a 20-year-old looksmaxxer who also livestreams on Kick. That's all you need to know. It's like the origins of the \"67\" meme: Sure, there's some obscure backstory with a line from a rap song, but the meme is really about how it means nothing. (I reached out to Clavicular, but didn't hear back.)\n\nThe output — these wacky phrases that are wrenching the English language to its logical conclusion of rot — is what is really important here. I suspect that long after we forget about the guy, we'll still be using these new terms like \"mogged\" and \"maxxed.\"\n\n(For the record, \"mogged\" is looksmaxxing forum lingo that's been around for a while and means to be better looking or better than someone else. It's now being used as a suffix, like \"frame-mogged\" for someone who has more impressive shoulders.)\n\nThere's no question that this vernacular has broken containment to normies. Whether that's good or bad is a matter of opinion.\n\nThere's also a business reason that suddenly you're seeing these wacky phrases everywhere, and it's not just organic meme adoption.\n\nA lot of the most over-the-top posts about \"jestermaxxing\" and \"frame mogging\" are coming as captions to video clips from third parties known as \"clippers.\"\n\nClippers are people who post short clips on social media from longer content like podcasts, livestreams, gaming, or even TV shows and movies. These clippers can have a financial motive: They can get paid by creator programs on platforms like TikTok, X, and Instagram Reels if their posts go viral. And they can also be paid by content creators themselves to promote their podcasts, livestreams, or other products.\n\nClippers are incentivized to find the most ridiculous moments in a livestream and slap on the most clickable, enticing caption or commentary for their posts on X and other social media platforms. This has created a kind of house style all its own — note the off-capitalization and tendency to end in a question.\n\nThe internet is always giving us new words and new terms. Sure, \"jestermaxxing\" will eventually sound old and cringe (perhaps soon, even), but this is the beautiful bounty of online communication. New ways of communicating and expressing! In this case, it also seems relevant to keep in mind that the new memewords are being pushed by people who are chasing dollars, not just lols.",

    "fullText": "From Cece and Schmidt finally saying \"I do\" on \"New Girl\" to Chuck and Blair eloping in Central Park during the \"Gossip Girl\" finale, weddings have made for some of the most memorable moments on television.\n\nThe wedding dresses that these beloved characters wear are almost as unforgettable as the weddings themselves — though some for better reasons than others.\n\nFor better or worse, Business Insider looked back at some of the best and worst dresses from TV weddings.\n\nBlair finally marries Chuck Bass in the \"Gossip Girl\" series finale in a last-minute wedding in Central Park.\n\nNever one to miss an opportunity for a fashion moment, Blair wore a pale-blue Elie Saab gown to the nuptials.\n\nThe dress was made of sparkly, semi-sheer fabric, and the bodice was adorned with floral appliqué to create a high-fashion yet timeless look, much like Blair herself. A belt at the waist and a tiara completed the showstopping look.\n\nSerena and Dan Humphrey's on-and-off relationship was a major plot point throughout the six seasons of \"Gossip Girl.\" The Upper East Side socialite and Brooklyn writer finally tied the knot in a flash-forward at the end of the show's series finale.\n\nNever one to follow convention, Serena ditched the classic white bridal dress for a gold Georges Chakra couture ball gown. The strapless ensemble featured an entirely gold bodice, with gold detailing across the tulle skirt that resembled paint splatters.\n\nDid the dress look more like it belonged at the Met Gala than at a wedding? Maybe, but this is \"Gossip Girl\" baby! And for a character as fashionable and trendsetting as Serena, it made perfect sense that she'd go against the norm on her wedding day.\n\n''I will never get tired seeing Blake wearing one of my designs and transforming it into a 'Serena' look,'\" Chakra told Elle in 2012. \"Her character has that effortless chic ability to break the rules and ditch your regular white wedding gown and make metallic gold accents acceptable and cool for a bride.\"\n\nLorelai and Luke finally get married in the \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" finale, saying \"I do\" in the middle of the night just hours before their wedding because they don't want to wait any longer.\n\nThe wedding was romantic, but the navy ensemble Lorelai wore didn't fit the grandeur of the occasion. Her tea-length dress had a faux white blouse on the top, coordinating with a white flower on the waistline. She wore a lacy cardigan over the gown, giving the whole look a matronly feel. The outfit didn't look like something Lorelai would wear to celebrate her marriage, especially given how over-the-top her fashion was on the show.\n\nThe dress also fell flat because it didn't compare to the stunning, blush gown she bought to marry Luke on season six of the original \"Gilmore Girls\" series. Even a look like the sparkly suit Emily Gilmore wore to renew her vows to her husband Richard would have been more fitting than the outfit Lorelai ended up in.\n\nJess and Nick get married in season seven of \"New Girl.\" Jess' tea-length white dress is pretty, with its belted, empire waist and full skirt.\n\nBut it doesn't make much of a statement, and Jess' outfit gets turned into the butt of a joke when she's forced to wear an eye patch after injuring herself.\n\nJess and Nick's wedding was a highly anticipated moment for \"New Girl\" fans, and it was disappointing that Jess didn't get to have her fashion moment as they said their vows.\n\nMolly had plenty of dating drama through the five seasons of \"Insecure,\" but she gets a happy ending — and one last incredible outfit — during the series finale.\n\nThe ambitious lawyer's style inspired a number of listicles while \"Insecure\" was on air, and star Yvonne Orji once joked that fans loved Molly's wardrobe more than the actual character.\n\nMolly sported a stunning Oscar de la Renta gown to tie the knot with her coworker, Taurean. The strapless dress, decorated throughout with a pattern of ferns, featured a sweetheart neckline and a voluminous skirt. It was chic, distinct, and perfect for Molly's character.\n\nMonica and Chandler's wedding on \"Friends\" takes place in both the season seven finale and season eight premiere for a two-episode special.\n\nMonica planned the wedding meticulously, and though she couldn't wear the dress she originally wanted after another shopper blackmailed her for it in \"The One With the Cheap Wedding Dress,\" she still chose a gorgeous gown for the big day.\n\nHer fit-and-flare gown was fitted throughout the bodice, forming a V-neckline. The dress had no embroidery or embellishment aside from a subtle trim on the neckline for a simple yet beautiful look.\n\nPhoebe's avant-garde style was a hallmark of her character throughout \"Friends,\" and her wedding dress needed to fit that aesthetic when she married Mike in season 10 of the series.\n\nHer silk gown's exposed corset, jewel sleeves, and ruched skirt had an old-world feel, while her traditional veil made her look like a bride.\n\nShe also wore an embroidered floral jacket until it was time for her outdoor winter wedding, which felt even more fitting for her character.\n\nWhen Rachel is introduced on \"Friends,\" she appears at Central Perk in her wedding dress, looking for Monica after running out on her wedding.\n\nThe gown is quintessential '90s wedding fashion, with its heavy lace, full skirt, and off-the-shoulder sleeves. But the whole look feels gaudy, from the floral print on the skirt to the voluminous veil.\n\nConsidering the look went along with Rachel's spoiled persona, it was fitting for the occasion.\n\nHilary donned a wedding dress in the season four premiere of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" when her boyfriend Trevor proposed to her while bungee jumping for their news show.\n\nThe dress had an off-the-shoulder neckline, subtle lace on the bodice, and a tulle skirt full of volume. The gown fit the '90s aesthetic without being over-the-top. Even Hilary's voluminous veil looked great with her ensemble.\n\nUnfortunately, Trevor died during his proposal, so the dress never actually appeared at a wedding.\n\nIn season four, the country-music superstar finally marries the love of her life, Deacon Claybourne. And her beautiful off-the-shoulder dress is easily one of our favorites on this list.\n\n\"Nashville\" costume designer Susie DeSanto told Glamour in 2016 that she wanted the dress to reflect Rayna's character and be \"simple, honest, not too fussy, elegant, and sophisticated.\" DeSanto said she showed sketches to Connie Britton, who played Rayna in the show, and ultimately wanted to create the kind of wedding dress \"you wear when you marry your true love.\"\n\nThe dress featured a lace bodice and a satin skirt, with a hand-sewn flower appliqué, according to Glamour.\n\nApril's season 10 wedding became famous among \"Grey's Anatomy\" fans, as she ran away with Jackson and married him instead of her fiancé, Matthew.\n\nBut her dress was almost as memorable as the episode itself. The dress had sheer, short sleeves that flowed into an adorned bodice, creating the illusion that the appliqué was floating up her torso. The dropped-waist skirt was adorned with flowers, and the gown flowed into a train.\n\nIt's not hard to see why Jackson interrupted the wedding to whisk April away.\n\nPreston left Cristina at the altar in the season three finale of \"Grey's Anatomy,\" though the bride-to-be had also been apprehensive about the wedding.\n\nDespite not wanting to be a bride, she looked every bit the part in her mermaid gown. Christina's lace dress was adorned with understated silver embellishments, and her updo showcased the choker Preston's mother gave her for the wedding.\n\nThe dress was gorgeous; it was just odd to see Cristina Yang wearing it.\n\nFrom preppy shirts and Juicy Couture tracksuits to halter tops and lace camis, Summer's closet perfectly encapsulated the colorful and chaotic boldness of early 2000s fashion. She loved bright shades, bold patterns, and graphic T-shirts — all of which matched her spunky, outspoken personality.\n\nMaybe the costume department was trying to illustrate Summer's character arc from trendy teen to vegan queen by picking this simple wedding dress. We love a classic moment, but the bodice was ill-fitting and completely swallowed Rachel Bilson's figure, while the full skirt looked wrinkled.\n\nPlus, it was just a little boring. After four seasons of watching Summer and Seth's love story, we would've loved Summer's dress to feel a little more memorable.\n\nIf \"Gossip Girl\" was a fantasy of NYC fashion, \"Girls\" set out to be the reality with off-the-rack clothes meant to reflect what women really wear in the city.\n\nAt first glance, the short, casual dress seems to fit Jessa's eccentric style. \"Girls\" costume designer Jenn Rogien told Fashionista in 2014 that Lena Dunham wanted the cast to \"look the best they had all season\" at the wedding. Rogien said she looked at both vintage and runway pieces and ultimately decided on this dress at a boutique owned by the mother of Jemima Kirke, who plays Jessa.\n\nThe story behind the outfit is great, but the dress doesn't fit the season finale's major twist. We love the cutout detailing on the oversize sleeves, but they clash with the lacy skirt. The overall look feels too casual, more akin to something you would've found at Free People in 2012. There are so many beautiful vintage and boho bridal looks, but this feels forgettable — and that's the opposite of Jessa.\n\nFrom an organ remix of \"Milkshake\" to a guest appearance by Victoria Beckham playing herself, a lot was happening during Wilhelmina Slater's wedding in the second season of \"Ugly Betty.\" But that didn't stop the former supermodel and MODE magazine editor from stealing the show.\n\nWilhelmina walked down the aisle in a luxurious silk gown designed by Vera Wang, who also played herself during the episode. The strapless column dress featured only a touch of sparkling embellishment, letting the gown's cut and stunning fabric take center stage.\n\nWe also loved how Wilhelmina paired the dress with matching silk elbow-length opera gloves. The ensemble couldn't have been a better match for our favorite stylish supervillain.\n\nSeveral major story decisions confused fans during the ninth and final season of \"How I Met Your Mother.\" But we're here to talk about Robin and Barney's wedding, not that wild twist in the series finale.\n\nRobin opts for a Monique Lhuillier gown to wed the reformed womanizer, and there's a lot we love about it. The exposed corset is a modern and unexpected style choice, and it pairs well with the sheer sleeves that hang just off her shoulders.\n\nHowever, it all gets ruined with the big, sparkling, silver belt. Not only does the belt's design seem dated, especially when the rest of the gown feels so fresh, but it cuts off Robin's body and throws off the ensemble's proportions, messing up what could have been a very chic moment.\n\nLily and Marshall got married in the season two finale of \"How I Met Your Mother\" after briefly breaking up at the start of it.\n\nLily's dress somehow had both too much and too little going on, as the bodice was heavily adorned with crystals and a silver bow, while the ball-gown skirt was plain.\n\nThe dress looked disconnected, and it didn't do Lily justice. Marshall's hat wasn't a great look, either.\n\nSimon agrees to marry Daphne only to protect her honor in the first season of \"Bridgerton,\" and their small, intimate wedding reflects that it's not much of a celebration.\n\nDaphne's wedding dress might not be grand or dramatic, but it's still beautiful for the moment. The gown features an empire waist and cap sleeves befitting of the time, and white flowers bloom across the skirt — a wink at the white rose Simon picked for Daphne earlier in the season, according to The Knot.\n\nClaire and Jamie get married in season one of \"Outlander\" to protect her from being taken by Jonathan Randall. However, they end up developing deep romantic feelings for each other after saying their marriage vows.\n\nClaire's green and off-white gown for the nuptials was elegant and sexy, with its low-cut, scooped neckline and off-the-shoulder, quarter-length sleeves. The corset cinched tight, and the skirt was full.\n\nDelicate beading adorned the bodice and the center of the skirt, making it stand out. Though Claire clearly felt torn about marrying Jamie because she was already married to Frank in the future, her wedding dress was breathtaking.\n\nBelly Conklin spends much of season three of \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" planning her wedding to Jeremiah Fisher.\n\nIn episode four, she goes wedding dress shopping and selects a white slip gown designed by Victoria Beckham. The gown has a scooped neckline and a low back with flared detailing on the skirt.\n\nThe gown is beautiful, but in the context of the series, it feels like an underwhelming choice for Belly. Because her parents aren't paying for the wedding, she tries to find the most affordable dress that she likes, which leads her to the simple dress.\n\nOn another bride, the gown may have been a dream dress, but on Belly, it feels like a symbol of the tension around her nuptials.\n\nThe protagonist of \"My Lady Jane\" is forced into an arranged marriage with Guildford Dudley in episode two of the series, which was later canceled.\n\nJane does everything she can to avoid the wedding, but she ultimately does marry Guildford in a stunning ball gown. The cream dress featured an embroidered, strapless Basque bodice that flowed into a floor-length skirt with additional beading. Detached, sheer sleeves fastened at her neck with a ruffled neckline and gem detailing.\n\nJane's gown was gorgeous, even if she wasn't excited to tie the knot.",

    "description": "One Air Force base's new mandated greetings for security personnel saw backlash, with troops and civilian workers calling them 'stupid.'",
    "fullText": "Gate guards at an Air Force base in Oklahoma have become targets of ridicule over a newly mandated greeting, according to an internal email.\n\nThe message, recently sent out by local senior enlisted leader MSgt. Bradley Opfar, warned against mocking the guards, known as Defenders, for delivering a scripted line: \"Good morning, sir/ma'am. Welcome to Altus AFB. Victory begins here!\"\n\n\"It frustrates me to write this to you all, but it is necessary,\" the email said. \"Anyone found disrespecting Defenders will be held accountable.\" The message warned that troops could face charges under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, while civilian employees could be reported to their supervisors.\n\nThe message included a sampling of the reactions that guards have faced at gates since February 4:\n\nOthers have dismissed the greeting as \"stupid\" and \"dumb,\" according to the message, which the Air Force verified.\n\nA spokesperson for Altus Air Force Base told Business Insider that \"victory begins here\" is its \"base vision.\"\n\n\"We adhere to a culture of professionalism and respect for every person who comes on our base, which is emphasized by the new Air Force-wide policy,\" the spokesperson said, adding that \"disrespect toward any member of our community will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe base, located in Altus, Oklahoma, is home to courses that train pilots on one of the military's largest cargo aircraft, the C-17 Globemaster III, and another unit that trains personnel on notoriously complex refueling missions. Altus AFB supports roughly 2,000 permanent military personnel and employs a significant number of civilian workers.\n\nThe base started requiring the new greeting after Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach and the top enlisted airman, Master Sergeant David Wolfe, sent a memo on January 30 addressing base greetings.\n\n\"The way we greet one another matters,\" the memo said. \"Professional greetings — at installation entry control points and throughout interactions with the public — must be the standard. First impressions set the tone and when paired with professional image, reinforce trust, authority and pride.\"\n\nThat memo referenced another base where gate guards greet drivers by saying, \"Fight's on!\"\n\n\"At one of our premier bases, Defenders greet patrons with, 'Good Morning, Sir/Ma'am/General/Chief. Welcome to ____ AFB. Fight's On!\" the memo read.\n\n\"This simple phrase,\" it continued, \"signals entry onto a military installation protected by vigilant Defenders and reflects our identity within the profession of arms. Every installation should ensure professional greetings are constantly practiced.\"\n\nThe new mandates are the latest sign of what appears to be a broader cultural shift inside the Air Force. The service last year introduced new quarterly uniform and fitness inspections — later scaling them back to once a year — and tightened grooming standards.",

    "fullText": "Vybe, the startup cofounded by two repeat Y Combinator entrepreneurs, has raised $10 million to bring vibe coding inside large companies.\n\nThe practice of vibe coding has become more widespread as it allows people to use AI and natural language prompts to build an app, rather than traditional programming. The sector has attracted hundreds of millions in venture funding and is blurring the lines for businesses deciding between buying software or just vibe-coding their own tools.\n\nWhile popular vibe-coding products like Lovable and Replit have made it easy for companies to create prototypes and landing pages, Vybe offers stronger security that cannot be modified by AI and also taps into internal data systems, said cofounder and CEO Quang Hoang.\n\nHoang previously founded the engineering mentorship platform Plato and is building Vybe alongside cofounder and CTO Fabien Devos, founder of the security AI startup Wolfia.\n\nVybe lets teams across an organization collaborate on apps. Engineering teams manage access to internal systems like Salesforce, Snowflake, and Databricks, while business teams can build apps for onboarding, performance reviews, customer service, and more.\n\n\"The new SaaS is going to be more like Legos,\" Hoang said, referring to software-as-a-service. \"You can build it exactly how you want.\"\n\nVybe also offers app templates created by high-profile executives, such as former Airbnb product leader Lenny Rachitsky and Front cofounder Mathilde Collin, that users can \"remix\" to suit their needs, including templates for performance reviews and one-on-one meetings.\n\nFirst Round Capital led Vybe's seed round, which featured participation from Y Combinator, the CEOs of Datadog and Grammarly, and product leaders from OpenAI and Meta.\n\nVybe has six employees and dozens of customers, Hoang said. It plans to use the funding to hire engineers. Vybe charges $12 per user a month, plus usage-based credits for app development.\n\nThe round comes as vibe coding continues to attract major funding — with startups like Emergent pulling in tens of millions from Khosla Ventures and SoftBank — even as Barclays analysts warn the initial boom may be cooling.\n\nAt the same time, investors are also weighing how AI and vibe-coding tools can reshape the software sector. Software stocks have entered one of their sharpest downturns in years, shedding roughly $2 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nHere's a look at the pitch deck Vybe used to raise its $10 million seed round.

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design is here. Apple and Google actually worked together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which makes switching between the two platforms more seamless.\n\nNews first broke about this partnership back in December, and, at that time, Google released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. Shortly after, Apple released the first beta for iOS 26.3, which featured the transfer tool. Now, iOS 26.3 is here, and with it, an easier way to switch from iPhone to a device made by Google, Samsung, or any other Android OEM.\n\nThe feature seems easy enough to use. Once you update your iPhone to iOS 26.3, you can head to Settings > General, then scroll down to \"Transfer or Reset iPhone.\" Tap this option, then choose \"Transfer to Android.\" Here, iOS will present a pop-up, telling you to place your iPhone next to your new Android device, where you can transfer photos, messages, and apps, among other data points. (That said, health data, devices paired with Bluetooth, and \"protected items\" cannot be transferred.)\n\nYou'll need to make sure both devices are running the latest updates, are connected to wifi, and have Bluetooth enabled. However, Apple also says your Android device should be in the \"setup process,\" which means you likely won't be able to use this feature if your Android phone is already set up. From here, your iPhone will ask you to scan a QR code that should appear on your Android device. Alternatively, you'll be able to tap \"Other Options\" on your iPhone to enter the Session ID and Pairing Code that should appear on your Android.\n\nNow, you can choose the data you want to transfer, including photos, contacts, calendars, call history, and messages. Tap \"Continue\" once complete, then choose to transfer your eSIM, if applicable. (You'll need to double-click the side of your iPhone when prompted to complete the eSIM transfer.) This works in the other direction too, though Apple says you do still need to use the Move to iOS app on Android—at least until Google sets up a similar protocol on its end.\n\nApple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",

    "title": "When You Need to Do 'Activation Exercises' (and When You Don't)",
    "description": "Activations don't always have an advantage over other types of warmups.",
    "fullText": "“Activation” exercises are often recommended at the beginnings of workouts. You might get the idea—whether from random TikToks or from a trainer you pay for their expertise—that activations are necessary to get your muscles firing correctly and able to take advantage of the workout to come. That’s not exactly true, though, so let’s dive in to what activations really do.\n\nThe explanation you’ll hear most often is that our muscles—often specifically our glutes, or butt muscles—“forget” how to fire correctly. But that isn’t really a thing that happens, as physical therapist Tyler Detmer told Lifehacker when discussing so-called gluteal amnesia. Our muscles don’t need specific exercises to be able to contract correctly.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean activation exercises are useless; it's better to think of these moves as warmups with a specific purpose. As I’ve written before, warmup exercises occupy a spectrum from general (like jogging on a treadmill before squats) to specific (doing lighter squats before doing heavier squats).\n\nThe warmups that are sometimes called “activation” exercises fall in the middle of that continuum. They can help you to get ready for your heavier exercises of the day, since they’re fairly specific to the muscles involved. If the person who designed your workout is good at their job, they're a great way to prepare for your working exercises. Unfortunately, not all activations are a good use of your time. So here are some of the cases where activation exercises are useful—and some where they aren’t.\n\nIf you’re going to do isolation exercises, it helps to know what it feels like to work the muscle properly. Using glutes as our example again, a side-lying leg raise can be done in ways that really use the glutes (when your leg is slightly behind you) or in ways that distribute some of the load to other muscles (like when your leg is slightly in front of you). When you’re doing those leg raises, you can pay attention to whether you’re feeling your glutes—but to do that, you have to know what it feels like to work your glutes.\n\nThat’s where activation exercises come in. You do a movement that’s hard to do without using your glutes, and you get to feel the sensations that go along with using that muscle. You might feel a burning sensation as the muscle begins to fatigue, or a tight, full feeling as the muscle fills with fluid (this is what bodybuilders call a “pump”). All of this helps to direct your attention to that muscle and what it feels like. When you do your next exercise, you’ll remember that feeling.\n\nThe more work you give a muscle, the bigger and stronger it tends to get. We often call that amount of work “volume” and measure that as the number of sets: You’ll build more muscle if you do six sets of squats at each workout than if you only do three.\n\nActivation exercises, if they’re challenging enough, can count toward those sets. Imagine we have two people in the gym: One does three sets each of banded walks and single-leg glute bridges (both often classed as activation exercises) before doing three sets of barbell hip thrusts. The other just does the hip thrusts. That first person is giving their glutes more work than the second, regardless of how the exercises are labeled.\n\nTo use activation exercises this way, though, they have to be challenging. If you do your activations heavy enough that you’re at or near the point of failure by the end of each set, they’re adding to your total volume. But if they’re light and easy and you’re just going through the motions, they aren’t really adding anything.\n\nI’ve described a few ways that activation exercises can help in your workouts, but that doesn’t mean that they’re unskippable. You don’t need to feel a muscle working to know that you’re giving it a good workout. And if you’d like to get more volume for a body part, you can do those extra sets before, after, or during your main workout; they don’t have to happen during the “activation” stage at the beginning.\n\nSo if you haven’t been doing activations, that’s fine. Just make sure you’re warming up in some kind of appropriate way. (If you’re not sure, read through this guide I wrote to putting together an effective warmup. A warmup is about what gets you ready to work, and it should really be personalized to your body and your workout.)\n\nBut if your trainer has given you activation exercises, or if you’ve seen a few you’d like to try online, go ahead and do them. They’ll give you extra work for the target muscle, and you might find that they help you to feel ready by the time you begin the main sets of your workout.",

YouTube for Vision OS is a free, standalone app that lets users log into their existing YouTube accounts through their Vision headsets and stream videos like they would expect to, including standard videos, 180° videos, 360° videos, and YouTube Shorts. Vision Pro M5 users can stream 8K videos, and premium YouTube members can download videos directly to their headsets, a must for long flights.\n\nGoogle, YouTube's parent company, has apparently been working on the app for a while. In 2024, a spokesperson confirmed that a standalone Vision Pro app was \"on our roadmap,\" but until today, the only way Vision users could watch YouTube on their headsets was through the Safari web browser.\n\nThe new YouTube app is designed to fit into Vision's spatial computing environments. \"Rather than just responding to different screen sizes, we needed something that responds to different spaces, volumes and use cases,\" YouTube's senior UX designer Brendan Polley told Apple. \"We built an entirely new design system that isolated core elements—comments, the play button, 'like' and 'dislike'—to fit any layout.\"\n\nHaving downloaded the app, it works exactly as intended.

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates dipped slightly lower this week, weathering volatility in bond markets. While bond yields sagged early in the week, Wednesday's surprising jobs report sent yields soaring. The news was digested quickly by the Treasury market, and a recovery to previously low levels took just a day.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed rate this week was 6.09%, down from 6.11% the previous week. The 52-week low is 6.06%. Meanwhile, the 15-year fixed averaged 5.44%, down from 5.50%.\n\n“Bolstered by strong economic growth, a solid labor market, and mortgage rates at three-year lows, housing affordability continues to measurably improve,\" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. \"These factors have caught the attention of many prospective homebuyers, driving purchase application activity higher than a year ago.”\n\nDiscover the best mortgage refinance lenders.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and the U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate, not just with banks, but also with credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is an amazing mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on your financial goals when refinancing, how long you plan to stay in the same house, and on your break-even point after paying the refinance closing costs.\n\nMortgage rates often decrease before a Federal Reserve meeting rather than after. So, what should you expect rates to do before the Fed meeting on January 27-28?\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already buy mortgage bonds, and Trump wants them to purchase $200 billion in bonds. Would this strategy cause mortgage rates to decrease?\n\nAverage mortgage rates are in the low 6% range, but there are ways to snag a lower rate. Learn about eight strategies for securing a mortgage rate under 6%.\n\nChase Home Lending has launched a mortgage refinance rate sale, and borrowers have until Sunday to lock in a discounted rate. Here's how to qualify and apply.\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs and home equity loans work differently. So, how much interest can you expect to pay on a second mortgage? Learn how these rates work.",

    "description": "You'll also get $30 in accessory credit while pre-ordering just for registering your interest.",
    "fullText": "Samsung has officially revealed when its next Galaxy Unpacked event, which is where everyone's expecting the Galaxy S26 series to be announced, will take place. But before it airs on Feb. 25 at 1 p.m. EST, the company's offering the chance to get ahead of the game by trading in your current phone for a little extra moolah. Right now, you can sign up on Samsung's website to trade in your phone for up to $900 while pre-ordering a Galaxy S26 phone (or, on the very unlikely chance the S26 isn't announced at the event, whatever is announced in its place).\n\nThat's $200 more than Samsung currently offers on trade-ins for its other phones, which top out at $700 when trading in a Galaxy S24 Ultra for a Galaxy S25 phone. And while you're signing up, you'll also get $30 to spend on accessories during (but not before or after) your pre-order. You can also choose to be entered in a $5,000 sweepstakes for general Samsung online store credit, if you'd like.\n\nThe catch? The pre-order window doesn't seem to be open quiet yet. Usually, that happens within a week of Galaxy Unpacked airing, but you can still get the process started now. Just head to Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked reservation website, enter your name and at least an email address (you can also toss in your phone number, if you'd like), and you'll be taken to the form you need. If you want to enter the sweepstakes, also check the box saying you want to enter.\n\nFrom there, you can pick your current phone manufacturer and your phone model from a drop-down menu. Note that the manufacturer options include Samsung, Apple, Google, and \"Other,\" so it seems like Samsung is willing to let you trade in phones it doesn't make, too. As for the model picker, you can pick models going back around five years for each of the manufacturer options, although if you don't see your model on the list, you can also pick \"Other\" here, too.\n\nI can't promise how much Samsung will give you for each specific phone model, although it stands to reason that newer and higher spec phones will earn you more. I'm also willing to wager that Samsung might give you more credit if you trade in one of its own phones, but that's just speculation. To get the full $900, I'm guessing you'll need to trade in a Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nOnce you've made your selection, hit Submit, then scroll down a bit and click what you're interested in getting offers from Samsung on. Make sure you at least select \"Trade In,\" and then click Submit here, too.\n\nAnd that's it for now. Samsung will now know what type of phone you have and that you're interested in a trade-in, and should email you with an appropriate trade-in offer once it's available. Again, this should happen closer to Unpacked, likely within a week of Feb 25.\n\nAll in all, it's a good opportunity for a deal, but it does continue an unfortunate trend of Samsung's—asking you to pre-order a device before it's officially been revealed, and before you know its full specs list. Luckily, a number of rumors for the Galaxy S26 has made it easy to guess at what we're likely to see, including a similar look to the S25, no ultra thin S26 Edge model, a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and a new 10MP telephoto lens on the Ultra model. For confirmation, though, we have no choice but to wait.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from transferring 20 inmates with commuted death sentences to the nation’s highest security federal prison, warning that officials cannot employ a “sham” process for deciding where to incarcerate the prisoners for the rest of their lives.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly ruled late Wednesday that the government cannot send the former death row inmates to the “Supermax” federal prison in Florence, Colorado, because it likely would violate their Fifth Amendment rights to due process.\n\nKelly cited evidence that officials from the Republican administration “made it clear” to the federal Bureau of Prisons that the inmates had to be sent to ADX Florence — “administrative maximum\" — to punish them because Democratic President Joe Biden had commuted their death sentences.\n\n“At least for now, they will remain serving life sentences for their heinous crimes where they are currently imprisoned,” wrote Kelly, who was nominated to the bench by President Donald Trump.\n\nIn December 2024, less than a month before Trump returned to the White House, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment.\n\nOn his first day back in office, Trump issued an executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to house the 37 inmates “in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.”\n\nTwenty of the 37 inmates are plaintiffs in the lawsuit before Kelly, who issued a preliminary injunction blocking their transfers to Florence while the lawsuit proceeds. All were incarcerated in Terre Haute, Indiana, when Biden commuted their death sentences.\n\nGovernment lawyers argued that the bureau has broad authority to decide what facilities the inmates should be redesignated for after their commutations.\n\n“BOP’s designation decisions are within its exclusive purview and are intended to preserve the safety of inmates, employees, and surrounding communities,” they wrote.\n\nThe judge concluded that the inmates have not had a meaningful opportunity to challenge their redesignations because it appears the outcome of the review process was predetermined.\n\n\"But the Constitution requires that whenever the government seeks to deprive a person of a liberty or property interest that the Due Process Clause protects — whether that person is a notorious prisoner or a law-abiding citizen — the process it provides cannot be a sham,\" Kelly wrote.\n\nThe Florence prison has housed some of the most notorious criminals in federal custody, including Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The prison is “unmatched in its draconian conditions,” the inmates' attorneys argued.\n\n“The categorical redesignations challenged here deprived Plaintiffs of an opportunity to show why they should not be condemned to a life bereft of human contact, in a cell the size of a parking spot, where they will see nothing out the window but a strip of sky,” they wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys said other courts have held that the conditions are not objectively cruel and unusual.\n\n“Plaintiffs fail to show that conditions at ADX are atypical for them,” they wrote.",

    "fullText": "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) dared Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) to try to throw him in jail during an explosive exchange at a Thursday Senate hearing.\n\nEllison was one of multiple witnesses to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday, and Hawley focused his question on fraud within the state of Missouri. The line of questioning led to Hawley flat-out accusing Ellison of being a criminal and both men demanding the other resign.\n\nHawley and Ellison threw down over a group convicted of fraud in the state during the Covid-19 pandemic. The group, Feeding Our Futures, was found to have defrauded a federal child nutrition program for around $250 million.\n\nHawley brought up reports that Ellison’s campaign received $10,000 from the group and suggested it was quid pro quo and he should be indicted. Ellison denied taking money directly from the group to help in any investigation.\n\n“It’s my hearing, pal!” Hawley warned Ellison as he continued to deny the accusations from the senator.\n\n“I’m not your pal. Don’t call me pal!” Ellison shot back.\n\n“Well, I should call you ‘prisoner’ because you should be in jail,” Hawley said as he accused Ellison of ignoring accusations of fraud against Feeding Our Futures.\n\n“Well, see what you can do about it,” Ellison defiantly said.\n\n“In 2019, whistleblowers came to you in your office and referred to you fraud allegations from feeding our futures and you blow them off,” Hawley said, referring to a report from the Minnesota Star Tribune suggesting whistleblowers brought up the fraud years prior to the group getting caught.\n\n“That’s a lie,” Ellison said, adding later, “They did not come to my office. You’re completely wrong about that. I did not take anybody’s money.”\n\nThe two continued debating whether reports of the $10,000 campaign contribution were true until things wrapped up with the pair each demanding the other’s resignation.\n\n“You’ve been right at the center of this fraud thing from the beginning, and you’ve enabled it,” Hawley said. “And sir, you should resign.”\n\n“Sir, you should resign,” Ellison responded. “I was thinking the same thing about you. I was thinking the exact same thing about you.”\n\nThe post Minnesota AG Dares GOP Senator To Try To Throw Him in Jail During Explosive Hearing: ‘I Should Call You Prisoner’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill says \"there are no easy games\" in the Nations League after being drawn with Hungary, Ukraine and Georgia.\n\nThe campaign begins with a quadruple-header from 23 September until 6 October, and two final matches in November.\n\nBefore starting their Nations League campaign, Northern Ireland travel to Italy in March for a World Cup play-off semi-final as they look to reach the tournament for the first time since 1986.\n\nO'Neill's side secured that play-off, and promotion to League B, by winning their League C group in 2024 and the manager says it's an \"exciting draw.\n\n\"The Nations League has proven to be a very competitive and valuable competition for us,\" he said.\n\n\"We will aim to approach every game with ambition, to be difficult to play against, and to give our supporters performances they can be proud of.\"\n\nEngland to face Spain and Croatia in Nations League\n\nNorthern Ireland famously beat Ukraine at the Euro 2016 finals but lost a friendly between the sides in 2021.\n\nIn a disappointing year, Hungary were relegated from League A and also missed out on a World Cup play-off following a dramatic defeat by the Republic of Ireland in November.\n\nGeorgia, whose star player is PSG's Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, beat Armenia in a play-off to remain in League B.\n\n\"It's a competitive group - there's no doubt about that,\" O'Neill added.\n\n\"At this level there are no easy games and we fully respect the challenge that lies ahead.\n\n\"We have faced Ukraine in recent years but haven't beaten them since 2016, so there's familiarity there\n\n\"Georgia are perhaps the unknown quantity for many, but that doesn't make them any less dangerous.\n\n\"Hungary are a well-organised, physical side with quality throughout the team and strong home support, which always makes for a tough test.\"\n\nFormer Northern Ireland defender and BBC Sport NI pundit Stephen Craigan said the \"draw could have been a lot worse\" and it would be realistic for O'Neill's side to avoid relegation.\n\n\"We've got more than enough in our locker to be competitive,\" he added.\n\n\"If we could stay in League B after this campaign I think everyone would be pleased and see it as progress.\n\n\"I think stability, which would be staying in League B. You can carry that experience forward.\n\n\"Getting relegated would not be the end of the world, but when you work so hard to get that promotion you want to try and maintain it as much as you can.\"\n\nCraigan admitted it was a positive Northern Ireland had earned promotion to League B and playing at the highest level possible would help a young squad.\n\nHe also pointed to last year's World Cup qualifiers, and said the side's away form was an area they could improve despite some strong performances.\n\n\"You are going to be playing against better teams and going to tougher venues,\" added Craigan.\n\n\"It will put the younger players under a bit of stress, but that's how they learn and progress.\n\n\"The next stage is to maintain a strong level of performance but get results off the back of them, particularly away from home.\n\n\"Our record away from home hasn't always been great, so that's the next challenge for this young group, to be more competitive.\"",

    "fullText": "Former Chelsea and Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling has joined Dutch club Feyenoord on a deal until the end of the season.\n\nThe England international left Chelsea by mutual consent in January after agreeing a settlement package with the Stamford Bridge club over the final 18 months of his contract, worth in excess of £300,000-per-week.\n\nSterling, 31, has spent time discussing numerous options, but joined Feyenoord, who are second in the Eredivisie table and managed by former Manchester United and Arsenal striker Robin van Persie.\n\n\"As a free agent, I've had, for the first time in a long time, the opportunity to control the next step,\" he said.\n\n\"In my career. I wanted to take my time to speak with clubs and their head coaches to better understand the role they envisioned for me and ensure that I can add real value in this next chapter.\n\n\"Having spoken in great detail with Robin, I'm confident that Feyenoord is a place I can be happy and establish myself as a valued member of the team. Playing abroad is a whole new challenge for me - and one I'm ready to embrace. Honestly, I'm just excited to get started.\"\n\nFeyenoord are 17 points behind league leaders PSV and Van Persie added: \"Naturally it's a fantastic feat that we've managed to convince a player of Raheem's calibre to sign with us.\n\n\"His football resume speaks for itself: he's a player whose qualities can change the outcome of a game without a doubt, and I am convinced he will turn out to be a valuable addition to the team as we work towards achieving our goals in the second half of this season.\"\n\nSources told BBC Sport that around 18 clubs in England and across Europe expressed an interest in Sterling.\n\nThe opportunity to play in a competitive league, to help Feyenoord achieve Champions League qualification and Van Persie's vision for his role in the team persuaded the forward to move to Holland.\n\nAfter joining Chelsea from Manchester City in July 2022, Sterling was supposed to be the face of a new era at Stamford Bridge.\n\nIn his first two seasons, the England international featured in 59 out of a possible 76 Premier League games under four different managers during a turbulent few years under the BlueCo ownership.\n\nBut after Chelsea appointed Enzo Maresca as manager in June 2024, the forward was loaned to Premier League rivals Arsenal after being deemed surplus to requirements by the Italian.\n\nHowever, after failing to impress during an underwhelming loan spell with the Gunners, Sterling was one of several players banished to the Chelsea 'bomb squad' by Maresca and made available for transfer last summer.\n\nHis move to Feyenoord draws the line under a difficult final two years with the London club.\n\nThis is big for the Eredivisie - but also for people in Holland, where the English game is really popular.\n\nSterling has been part of the Premier League for so long and achieved big things, especially with Manchester City.\n\nWhen players who have won the Premier League in England, like Jordan Henderson and Sterling, come to Holland it is a bit like \"wow, is this really happening?\"\n\nWithout them even kicking a ball or playing it already gives an extra layer of allure, or something special, to the Eredivisie.\n\nLet's see how it goes in a football sense, but I think Sterling still has a decent level and especially for the Eredivisie - so it could work out for player and club.\n\nHe might get the fun back of playing football, and Feyenoord boss Robin van Persie knows England well.\n\nSterling can just enjoy himself, and a lot of people will really like the fact he is playing. That could be a bonus for what he is able to show on the pitch.\n\nHe could have a similar impact to Henderson last year at Ajax, putting in good performances on the pitch and then showing his leadership in the dressing room.\n\nSterling is used to the highest standards at clubs like Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nIf he can help bring the level of professionalism and way of working from those clubs, that can only be a positive thing for Feyenoord.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "fullText": "Ange Postecoglou has criticised Tottenham's transfer strategy while claiming his former side are \"not a big club\" in the wake of Thomas Frank's sacking.\n\nFrank, who replaced Postecoglou as head coach last summer, was sacked on Wednesday with Spurs five points above the Premier League relegation zone.\n\nSpeaking on The Overlap's Stick to Football, external podcast, the Australian praised the club's \"unbelievable\" facilities but said financial limitations meant they could not sign his main targets, such as Pedro Neto, Bryan Mbeumo, Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi, in 2024.\n\n\"When you look at their expenditure and particularly their wages structure, they're not a big club,\" he said.\n\n\"I saw that because, when we were trying to sign players, we weren't in the market for those players.\"\n\nPortuguese forward Neto joined Chelsea in a £54m deal in 2024, Mbeumo moved to Manchester United for £65m last summer, while Semenyo and Guehi moved to Manchester City for a combined £85m last month.\n\nSpurs' Odobert to undergo surgery after rupturing ACL\n\nPostecoglou guided Spurs to fifth in the Premier League during his first season in charge, but he was sacked after a 17th-placed finish the following season.\n\nHe did, however, end the club's 17-year wait for silverware by winning the Europa League in 2025.\n\n\"I think they didn't realise that, to actually win, you've got to take some risks,\" he said.\n\n\"I felt like Tottenham as a club were saying, 'we're one of the big boys', and the reality is I don't think they are.\"\n\nSince Mauricio Pochettino's departure in 2019, Spurs have had five different managers.\n\nJose Mourinho took charge between 2019 and 2021, but was sacked just days before the Carabao Cup final against Manchester City.\n\nNuno Espirito Santo's tenure lasted only four months, while Antonio Conte criticised the club's board and called his players 'selfish' before he was sacked after 16 months in charge.\n\nHis successor Postecoglou was dismissed last summer, while Frank lasted less than a year of his three-year contract.\n\nPostecoglou, who was sacked by Nottingham Forest after just 39 days in charge earlier this season, questioned whether Frank was aware how things would operate when he accepted the job.\n\n\"You know that he can't be the only issue at the club,\" said the 59-year-old.\n\n\"It's a curious club, Tottenham.\n\n\"It made a major pivot at the end of last year, not just with me but with [executive chairman] Daniel [Levy] leaving as well, and created this environment of uncertainty.\n\n\"There's no guarantee whichever manager you bring in. They've had world-class managers there and they haven't had success. And for what reason?\n\n\"Thomas is walking in and what's his objective? What's the club's objective?\n\n\"If you're going to do such a major pivot, you've got to understand there's going to be some instability there.\n\n\"Did Thomas know he was walking into that? I don't know.\"\n\nWhy Frank at Tottenham was a gamble that ended in bitter failure\n\nFrank sacked by Spurs after eight months in charge\n\nRamsey fires Newcastle to rare away win at Spurs",

He will try everything to be with us in March. Of course we are in contact, that is a normal thing to do, and we wish him all the best.\n\n\"Whatever we can do for him, we will help and support him. It is a little race against time.\"\n\nAsked whether he believed Bellingham would be fit, Tuchel added: \"Personally, I am optimistic, but I am not sure.\"\n\nIf Bellingham, who has 46 England caps, fails to prove his fitness, the news will arrive as an obvious blow to Tuchel.\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund midfielder's position in the squad has been the subject of conjecture in recent months, with Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers often starting in the number 10 role.\n\nNevertheless, Bellingham is still viewed as a key player for England heading into this summer's World Cup, with Tuchel set to name his squad in May.\n\nReal and England wait on Bellingham injury",

    "fullText": "Wales are set to make changes to midfield and their back-row for Sunday's Six Nations game against France in Cardiff.\n\nSteve Tandy names his side on Friday morning and will resist the temptation to make mass changes after the round one hammering by England.\n\nScarlets centre Joe Hawkins is in line to replace Ben Thomas at 12, while physical Leicester forward Olly Cracknell is poised to bolster the back-row.\n\nWales could also switch their props after loose-head Nicky Smith and tight-head Archie Griffin started at Twickenham, with Rhys Carre and Tomas Francis on the bench.\n\nTandy is otherwise ready to give his side a shot at redemption against Les Bleus, with a six-day turnaround to follow for Wales' home fixture against Scotland on 21 February.\n\nRecalled Francis relishing chance to help Wales\n\nWales U20s aim to provide hope in 'dark time'\n\nWales forward Tshiunza could leave Exeter in summer\n\nFit-again Owen Watkin was another option to come into midfield, but Tandy has gone with the Scarlets pair of Hawkins and Eddie James against France's new-look Pau combination of debutant Fabien Brau-Boirie and Emilien Gailleton.\n\nCardiff's Thomas started against Argentina and Japan in the autumn series before Hawkins, who returned to Wales from Exeter last summer, came in to face New Zealand and South Africa.\n\n\"If you are looking for consistency, the natural fit is bringing in Joe Hawkins at 12 with Eddie because they play together at regional level,\" former Wales hooker Scott Baldwin told Scrum V: The Warm Up.\n\n\"The only other two changes for me would be Cracknell for his work-rate and physicality and then - and this isn't a slight on [hooker] Liam Belcher because he is a brilliant player - but Ryan Elias is an exceptional scrummager. He could come in to that bench spot.\"\n\nWales v France, Principality Stadium\n\nSunday, 15 February at 15:10 GMT\n\nCracknell was a late call-up for the November series after the loss of Taulupe Faletau to injury.\n\nThe 31-year-old blind-side or number eight made his Test debut off the bench against Argentina and then won man of the match in the last-kick win versus Japan.\n\nCracknell is in line to join Aaron Wainwright and Alex Mann in the starting back row at the expense of open-side Josh Macleod.\n\n\"The balance probably wasn't right last weekend,\" said former Wales flanker and captain Ellis Jenkins.\n\n\"It's making sure we have enough physicality so that we can match France at the contact area, tackle and collision.\n\n\"I like Alex Mann and Josh Macleod in their own right, but I am not sure against England and France whether it's a bit under-powered.\"\n\nWales could stick with a split of six forwards and two backs on the bench against the physicality of Les Bleus.\n\nTandy's side are huge underdogs against a France side that eased past Ireland on opening weekend.\n\nWales have lost their past 12 games in the Six Nations, a streak that goes back to the win against Italy in Rome in March 2023.",

    "fullText": "Tries: Wood 2, Galeano Goals: Harris 3 Drop-Goal: Hingano\n\nTries: Whitbread 2, Sue Goals: Martin 3\n\nReigning champions Hull KR suffered a shock defeat by debutants York Knights in the opening game of the 2026 Super League season.\n\nSam Wood's early try gave the hosts a surprise lead before Jai Whitbread barged over to make it 6-6 at the break.\n\nWhitbread reached over for his second score to put the visitors in front and Sauaso Sue went in under the posts to seemingly put Hull KR in charge.\n\nHowever, the game was turned on its head after the away side were reduced to 12 players after Mikey Lewis was sin-binned for a petulant trip on Liam Harris.\n\nWood got the Knights back in the game while Harris was off and Scott Galeano crossed to level the scores once more, before Ata Hingano landed a drop-goal to give York a fairytale victory.\n\nThe ramifications of this defeat could also be felt beyond this week for last season's treble-winners.\n\nHalf-back Lewis foolishly kicked out at York skipper Harris and could now miss next week's World Club Challenge against National Rugby League premiers Brisbane Broncos through suspension.\n\nYork enjoyed a stellar campaign in the Championship in 2025 before being moved up into an expanded Super League alongside Bradford Bulls and Toulouse for this season.\n\nFew gave them a chance in this match, but in front of a passionate home support and in torrential rain throughout, they made a great start when Wood went over in the corner after ill-discipline from the away team gave them good field position.\n\nKR led through Whitbread's converted try but Harris landed a penalty on the hooter to send the teams in level at half-time.\n\nWillie Peters' men improved after the interval and Whitbread's second and Sao's score looked to have set a platform for a victory with the home side's energy levels dropping.\n\nBut Hull KR's ill-discipline came back to haunt them when Lewis bizarrely left a foot in on Harris after a kick and was sin-binned.\n\nHarris kicked goals after Wood's second try and Galeano's effort before Hingano gave York a historic success.\n\nYork Knights head coach Mark Applegarth told BBC Radio 5 live:\n\n\"I'm proud as punch. We knew if we could be there or thereabouts in the last 20 minutes then the pressure would be on them and luckily we were.\n\n\"We've got a lot of self-belief and we'll back ourselves to the hilt.\n\n\"Belief goes a long way in sport and we spoke about that before the game. I know a lot of headlines all week were we were lambs to the slaughter but we were quietly confident if we brought our best version we could challenge them.\n\n\"It's one game so we wont get too high, we'll enjoy tonight and then we'll get focused on Leeds for next week.\"\n\nHull KR head coach Willie Peters told BBC Radio Humberside:\n\n\"I'm very frustrated. It was a really ill-disciplined performance.\n\n\"It was there to see what Mikey did. He needs to learn from what he did because it was a key moment in the game. He knows and he's owned it but I want to see some action off the back of it.\n\n\"We were in control then and then we lost control off the back of it. We didn't handle it well as a team.\n\n\"We knew exactly what they were going to bring, they were very good. They got the crowd involved and worked hard, there was no surprise there. They came over the top of us and in the end we got what we deserved.\"\n\nYork: Mataafa, Jones-Bishop, Wood, Williams, Galeano, Hingano, Harris, Va'a, McShane, Vaughan, Field, Dee, Thompson.\n\nInterchanges: Balmforth, Martin, Sangare, Griffin.\n\nHull KR: Mourgue, Davies, Hiku, Gildart, Burgess, Lewis, May, Sue, Litten, Brown, Martin, Batchelor, Minchella.\n\nInterchanges: Broadbent, Luckley, Whitbread, Lawton.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nCaoimhin Kelleher (Brentford): We are struggling for goalkeepers this week, if I'm being totally honest. However, to play how he played against Arsenal and make a critical save right at the end was huge. The save against Gabriel Martinelli was probably the deciding factor that got him into the team.\n\nLamare Bogarde (Aston Villa): If you looked purely at stats, you would have said Aston Villa should have absolutely thrashed Brighton...except they didn't. It was a Brighton team that played very, very well and Bogarde stood up to the task at right back. He's a midfielder by trade so to see him playing right-back - which he has done a few times this season - was fantastic.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool): Obviously gets the goal, but up at Sunderland - that wind, that crowd and the pitch was really poor - the ability to be a class above everyone else. He made sure Liverpool weren't really stretched. Defensively it was all Virgil van Dijk.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City): He looks like he's been playing for Manchester City for about eight years. Solid, composed, wonderful on the ball - he's just fitted in seamlessly. He helped City to a clean sheet in a 3-0 win against Fulham. He kept Fulham right at arm's length. Very, very good, for me.\n\nBashir Humphreys (Burnley): Probably one of the best performances of the week, and for him this season. Very strong in a tackle, offered loads going forward and defensively solid.\n\nMateus Fernandes (West Ham): He's one of those players that looks like he would infuriate me, both to play with and against. He did all the ratty things really well. He's got high energy, he's young, talented and he's the heartbeat of the team. He gets caught up sometimes in silly moments, trying to buy fouls when he doesn't really have to. I thought it was his best performance for West Ham this season - a very mature performance.\n\nNico O'Reilly (Manchester City): I love seeing him play in midfield. He adds the legs and energy into City's midfield - and obviously he gets his goal there as well. I feel the more he plays in his natural position - with Rodri around him - he'll be a star, not only for Manchester City but England moving forward as well.\n\nJacob Ramsey (Newcastle): When Newcastle's midfield has been torn up because of injury or suspension in the last few weeks, he's quietly gone about his business. He's been excellent and made sure he delivers in terms of performances and now goals. I think he's a real steal for Newcastle.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): I'm going to give a sympathy vote to Cole Palmer. He was in there last week because he scored a hat-trick against Wolves - but this week: goal, assist, and is a level above everyone else - but what a miss that was. If he scores that goal, Chelsea obviously win the game. He's a shoo-in. That miss does put a little stain on it, but I thought his overall performance was miles better.\n\nJoao Pedro (Chelsea): He's flying! Everyone puts that down to Liam Rosenior, but I put it down to having Cole Palmer back. Being able to have a player that can play behind him, find the passes and allows him to link up and move around, is why you're seeing the best of him. I think that is five in five now for Joao.\n\nJorgen Strand Larsen (Crystal Palace): I've been very critical of his move to Crystal Palace. I thought they got a lesser player than Jean-Philippe Mateta, however he scored two goal. Palace didn't win, but he's off the mark. You have to say fair play, he did well.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): It was Manchester City's first opportunity in a while to play before Arsenal and pile the pressure on.\n\nPep Guardiola guided City to a 3-0 win against Fulham, dominated the game, took Erling Haaland off and rested him, and was in a position to have John Stones on the bench and not have to use him.\n\nRuben Dias was back, he got to rest Rodri, his rotation was good, and he will feel really strongly about being in a position to kick on for the rest of the season with all his players starting to come back.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "description": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton takes on Daffy Duck and Porky Pig - and AI - with his predictions for all 16 FA Cup fourth-round ties.",
    "fullText": "BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton has a couple of very special guests for the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nHe is joined by Looney Tunes duo Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, the stars of new film 'The Day The Earth Blew Up', to make predictions for all 16 ties.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can see what AI thinks and choose your winner from each tie, below.\n\nDaffy and Porky were first drawn in the 1930s and the actor who initially voiced Porky had a stammer, and therefore so did the character.\n\nHi Daffy and hello Porky. This weekend it's the FA Cup - a historic competition famous for upsets and under-dogs - or is it under-ducks? - where the top Premier League teams sometimes lose to part-time sides. Are you excited about it!?\n\nDaffy: Are you kidding? I'm tho exthited. It'th incredible. Thtupendous! And the only thing that could make me more exthited is if I knew what the heck it was!\n\nPorky: I love sp-sp-sp-all kinds of athletic competition but I mostly play b-baseball and basketball, so I just hope the best team wins.\n\nThe FA Cup started in 1871 so it's even older than both of you... could we trust the pair of you if we gave you the job of looking after the famous old trophy together?\n\nDaffy: But of courth - there's no one more truthtworthy than me - and to prove it I'll take your cup far far far over yonder for thafe-keeping...\n\nPorky: Daffy, that's not the trophy that's a t-t-ttea cup. The British love drinking tea.\n\nDaffy: Oh. Wise guys, huh? Wathting my time!\n\nYou both have to save the world in 'The Day The Earth Blew Up' but this is an even bigger challenge - can you get better of our pundit and football expert Chris Sutton at predictions by picking the right scores? How confident are both of you about beating him?\n\nDaffy: You want a prediction? My prediction is we will dethtroy him! Annihilate him! Crush him! Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: He he, now d-don't get carried away, Daffy. Nothing wrong with a little friendly competition, but it doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's how you p-p-play the game. All that matters is that we all have fu-fu-fu-fu... a good time!\n\nDaffy, you asked for Michael Jordan's autograph in Space Jam, would you want Chris' autograph? He won the Premier League in 1995... but he can be a bit of a know-it-all and even a little boastful at times, a bit like Foghorn Leghorn. Are you impressed, and what would you tell him if you met him?\n\nDaffy: As a perthon of great refinement, delicathy and modethty, I have no time for boathtful people. They're dethpicable. I find the best way to deal with them ith to whack 'em over the head with a plank. Do you have any plankth I could use?\n\nPorky, you have to deal with Daffy's short fuse and madcap ideas... how would you feel about having Chris as a sidekick instead? Would you be as loyal to him as you are to Daffy?\n\nPorky: Well, I pp-pride myself on being lo-lo-lo—faithful... but I would consider having a less Daffy and messy housemate!\n\nYou've both played basketball with the rest of the Tune Squad in the Space Jam movies, would you fancy a go at soccer (or football as we call it in the UK)?\n\nDaffy: I helped defeat a team of alien 'Monstars'. It really wouldn't be fair to your little thoccer teams to take on thuch a thupreme athlete as mythelf.\n\nPorky: I think I'd p-p-prefer to be the referee. I like the whistle.\n\nMaybe both of you would be better as managers - together as a double-act to make the big decisions? Some managers are loyal and optimistic like Porky... some are more desperate for attention, like Daffy?\n\nDaffy: With my unique combination of thkill and thrategy I think I could be a great player and a coach. At the thame time. And thell the refreshments and merchandithe. I thee it now - Daffy Thtadium - home of Daffy United!\n\nPorky: I've been a successful t-t-talent agent, so I think I would make a good ma-ma-ma-ma- head coach. I've been learning the offside rule. Let me read b-b-back my notes. \"If a player scores a g-g-goal and you don't want it to count, that's offside.\"\n\nThere are no replays. Games will be decided by extra time and penalties.\n\nGap = league places between the two teams\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat. We asked the tool to predict the score of each tie.\n\n4th in Championship v 5th in Premier League\n\nChelsea boss Liam Rosenior is really well thought of by Hull fans from his time in charge there, and he is a former Tigers player as well.\n\nSo, he should get a great reception there on Friday night, but what he really needs is a win - especially after letting a two-goal lead slip against Leeds on Tuesday.\n\nRosenior has had some great results with Chelsea but it seems some fans aren't convinced by him. He will be desperate to prove them wrong by winning a trophy and the FA Cup is a great opportunity for him to do that this season.\n\nHull are going well in the Championship under Sergej Jakirovic but I just see Chelsea being too strong for them.\n\nI scored for Chelsea against Hull in the FA Cup, many years ago. We won 6-1 that day and Chelsea are going to win comfortably this time too.\n\nDaffy: Should be a hulluva a game. Woo-hoo!\n\nPorky: I guess Chelsea will have to g-g-go to Hull and back.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n6th in Championship v 3rd in Championship\n\nBoth teams are in the thick of the promotion race, and they meet again in Wales in the league next weekend.\n\nWith that in mind, I just wonder whether Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna will be the one to change things up here.\n\nI hope he doesn't but I think he might, because his side are in reach of the automatic spots, and that would be Wrexham's chance.\n\nEven so, I think this will be close. I'd normally just tip Ipswich to lose anyway but this prediction is for my daughter's teacher, Mr Fields, who is a big fan and will be delighted that I am backing them.\n\nAs for moneybags Wrexham, well I don't think their Hollywood stardust will help to take them to Wembley, but after this they will be able to focus on their play-off bid.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra time, Ipswich win on penalties\n\nDaffy: Ipswich Town wrecks'em? Well they should be more careful with their Tractorth!\n\nPorky: I think we have to say Hooray for Ho-Holl-holl-holl-Tinseltown and go with Wrexham.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-0\n\n22nd in League One v 18th in Premier League\n\nBurton are struggling in League One, with only one win in their past nine league games, but they have scored 14 goals in their three FA Cup wins to get this far, and I can see them scoring again at home here.\n\nI don't think we will see a shock, though. West Ham look like they have turned a bit of a corner, and they will be gutted to have conceded an equaliser so late on against Manchester United on Tuesday.\n\nHammers boss Nuno Espirito Santo won't want to lose the momentum that they've built in the past few weeks so, while he might make a couple of changes, he will still pick a team strong enough to get through.\n\nDaffy, when told that West Ham's famous song is 'we're forever blowing bubbles': No thir, no bubbleth, no way. Not after we went through with the zombie bubble gum. I'm going with Burton Albion (whatever that means).\n\nPorky: Yes, I don't want to b-b-b-bur- pop anyone's balloon, but I agree with Daffy. Bub-bub-bubbles can be tough to b-b-beat though. I think it will be tight.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 2-1\n\n19th in Premier League v 12th in League One\n\nAs I said on the Monday Night Club, I feel like some Burnley fans are forgetting how difficult it is for any promoted team in the Premier League. They look at how Sunderland and Leeds are doing, and think 'why not us?'\n\nClarets boss Scott Parker is taking a lot of flak at the moment, so he really needed Wednesday's win over Crystal Palace. That was a great result but he cannot afford to follow it by slipping up at home to a mid-table League One side.\n\nI am not expecting that to happen here - Burnley were up against an in-form Millwall side in round three and brushed them aside.\n\nBut I do think we will see some goals and some entertainment - there has not been much of either at Turf Moor this season. Mansfield beat Sheffield United 4-3 in the last round, and I can see them going out all guns blazing.\n\nDaffy: I think you're jutht making teamth up now.\n\nPorky: I'll support b-b-b-b-b-oh forget it - Mansfield.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n2nd in Premier League v 6th in League Two\n\nManchester City beat Salford City 8-0 in last season's FA Cup and the only thing I am not sure about here is how many they will score this time.\n\nSalford are doing well in League Two and I like their manager, Karl Robinson, but they are going to be outclassed.\n\nDaffy: I've heard of Manchethter... which is more than I can say for the otherth.\n\nPorky: Th-th-th-that's good enough for me!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-0\n\n16th in Championship v 19th in Championship\n\nThis prediction is not quite as straightforward as just looking at recent form. West Brom are really struggling while Norwich are flying - and beat the Baggies 5-0 on 20 January - but my old club have got so many injuries at the moment.\n\nI am still going to back Norwich here though. Philippe Clement has got the team playing really well and it was great to see Mohamed Toure hit a hat-trick on his first start for the club, against Oxford on Tuesday.\n\nClement says they showed Toure images of Erling Haaland beforehand to show how he creates space for himself, and Romelu Lukaku to see how he uses his body.\n\nI'm sure someone at Carrow Road could dig out some old VHS tapes of me in action for the Canaries if Toure needs any more inspiration. Although finding a video to play them on might be tricky.\n\nDaffy, when told Norwich are Chris Sutton's old team: You keep talking about thith Crith Thutton like I'm thupposed to care about him. Jutht for that I'm picking the Women's Basketball Association.\n\nPorky: No, Daffy it says here that WBA is West Bromwich Albion.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. What about Eatht Bromwich and North Bromwich, and Thouth Bromwich. That'th a lot of Bromwich!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 1-2\n\n24th in League One v 8th in Championship\n\nPort Vale are toiling at the bottom of League One. Bristol City have been a bit erratic too, but they are still only a point off the Championship play-off places.\n\nCity have got a huge game coming up at Wrexham on Tuesday, which might be a bit of a distraction for this tie, but I still see them reaching round five.\n\nDaffy: Doeth everyone in thith country have their own team? How many more are there?\n\nPorky: B-B-Bristol sounds like bristle. And pigs have bristles so...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2\n\n9th in Championship v 21st in Championship\n\nIt was absolutely unbelievable what happened when these two teams met in the league on Tuesday. Leicester were 3-0 up at half-time, but ended up losing 4-3 in the 97th minute.\n\nHow do the Foxes come back from that? I don't think they will. They will be angry, and are bound to be fired up, but you just wonder what damage it has done to their confidence and morale.\n\nLeicester had a points deduction last week which left them in big trouble at the bottom of the table and they don't have a manager at the moment - Andy King is caretaker boss and at half-time you can just imagine how he feels too.\n\nSouthampton are one of the form teams in the division, with four wins in their past five games, and I don't see Leicester getting any revenge here.\n\nDaffy: Hmmm. Thouthhampton or Lie-theth-ter...\n\nPorky: It's pr-pr-pronounced \"Lester\"\n\nDaffy: What is wrong with you people? Can't you thpell?? In that cathe...\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n3rd in Premier League v 10th in Premier League\n\nI was delighted for Newcastle boss Eddie Howe that his team beat Tottenham and also the reception he got from his side's fans afterwards.\n\nFor everything he has done for them, the world must have gone bonkers for their fans to be calling up 606 and saying they wanted him out.\n\nThis will be a very different test to playing Spurs, however, and I am going with my gut feeling on this one.\n\nThe two sides met recently when Villa won at St James' Park at the end of January and although Villa have slipped up a couple of times at home recently, when it clicks for them, they usually end up winning.\n\nDaffy, when told Newcastle are known as the 'Toon' by their fans, who are 'The Toon Army': You had me at Toon! Though I do like the thound of thtaying in a nithe villa.\n\nPorky: Remember Space Jam? No one can beat toons!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-2 (And th-th-th-that's gonna be all folks!)\n\n6th in Premier League v 14th in Premier League\n\nLiverpool boss Arne Slot and Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler are both under pressure but it feels like Hurzeler has the bigger problems to solve.\n\nBrighton are on a poor run and apparently it all got a bit ugly at their home defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday. The fans seem to have lost faith in him, and although that feels harsh to me, when it happens then it it is hard to reverse it.\n\nThe Seagulls beat Manchester United away in round three and now Hurzeler could really do with beating Liverpool away too.\n\nI wouldn't put it past them, either, especially with Liverpool struggling to see out games at the moment, but I think Slot's side will just about get over the line.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Liverpool to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Liverpool, home of The Beatleth - finally thomewhere I've heard of!\n\nPorky: Someone told me, \"if you don't know anything about foo-foo-foo-soccer, just say you support Liverpool.\"\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 4-1\n\n10th in Championship v 15th in Premier League\n\nLeeds' comeback from 2-0 down to draw at Chelsea was just extraordinary, but I can smell an upset here.\n\nI am sure Leeds boss Daniel Farke will make some changes because he will have at least half an eye on the Premier League, and their next game against Aston Villa.\n\nBirmingham are going well under Chris Davies and are unbeaten in eight games in all competitions. This seems like a good time for him to take a top-flight scalp.\n\nDaffy: I didn't know a team from Alabama could play here.\n\nPorky: I don't think it's the same one.\n\nDaffy: Birmingham all the way - woohoo!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 100-0\n\n12th in League Two v 20th in Premier League\n\nI know all about Grimsby because I was at Blundell Park for their Carabao Cup win over Manchester United earlier in the season.\n\nCould something similar happen again? Yes, definitely. There will be another cracking atmosphere and David Artell and his players will fancy another upset, I am sure of that.\n\nThis is a horrible game for Wolves, but it is an important one for their manager Rob Edwards. He needs to find a way of getting through this tie, which is something Ruben Amorim could not do with United.\n\nWolves have had a miserable season and they probably thought it couldn't get any worse - well it might.\n\nI think lightning might strike twice, and this game will end in a draw before Grimsby win the shootout, just like they did against Manchester United.\n\nSutton's prediction: 1-1 after extra-time, Grimsby to win on penalties.\n\nDaffy: Grimthby eh? Thounds grim and deprething. I'll go with the Wolves.\n\nPorky: I think they'll huff and puff and run out steam. At least I hope so.\n\n23rd in Championship v 11th in Premier League\n\nBoth of these teams got through the last round on penalties, with Oxford beating MK Dons and Sunderland overcoming Everton.\n\nI don't see Sunderland needing a shootout this time, though. Oxford are pretty woeful at the moment and have just been spanked by Norwich - they are not coming back from that.\n\nRegis le Bris will make changes but the Black Cats will still be far too strong.\n\nDaffy, when told that Sunderland are nicknamed the Black Cats - so would not get on with Tweety Pie: Birdth of a feather mutht stick together against catth!\n\nPorky: And Oxford is a place of higher ed-ed-edu-learning. So I think they'll outsmart the opposition.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 3-1\n\n14th in Championship v 12th in Premier League\n\nStoke's boss is my old Norwich team-mate Mark Robins, who is an excellent manager - he clearly learnt a lot from me - but I fancy Fulham here.\n\nI don't know what Marco Silva's situation is with Fulham and if he is leaving at the end of the season, but he will want to go out with a bang.\n\nI really like the way Silva's side play, and I wouldn't rule out the Cottagers' chances of going deep in the FA Cup this season.\n\nDaffy: I think I know which one Porky liketh here.\n\nPorky: A f-f-f-full ham? You bet!\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\n1st in Premier League v 21st in League One\n\nThis is the first meeting between these two clubs since the 2014 FA Cup semi-final, when Arsenal won on penalties and Mikel Arteta scored in a shootout. The Gunners went on to beat Hull in the final.\n\nThings have changed a lot for Wigan since then, and not in a good way.\n\nThey have just sacked their manager Ryan Lowe after sliding into the League One relegation zone, and it's hard to see them forcing a shootout this time, no matter how many changes Arteta makes.\n\nArsenal have not had much joy in the FA Cup since Arteta won it again as manager in 2019-20, a few months after taking charge.\n\nThey have not been past round four since, but they are going to make it to the last 16 this time, I'm sure of it.\n\nIn fact, they have got so much strength in depth now that, while for years Arteta has not been able to win anything at all, he could feasibly win four trophies this season.\n\nIs the Quadruple on? That could be the question we are asking in the final few months of the season.\n\nDaffy: You thee, the problem with Arthenal is they just try to walk it in.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-1\n\n6th in National League North v 7th in Premier League\n\nI am co-commentating on this game for 5 Live with Ali Bruce-Ball and I cannot wait.\n\nMacclesfield boss John Rooney did an incredible job with his side's historic win over Crystal Palace in round three.\n\nI watched the game back as part of my prep and, while the Silkmen had less than 29% possession, they limited Palace to very few chances and they were deserved winners.\n\nKnocking the holders out was rightly hailed as the biggest shock in the FA Cup's illustrious history, and it would be another fantastic feat if they toppled Brentford too.\n\nOnly one non-league side has ever beaten two top-flight teams in the same FA Cup campaign - Millwall in 1913-14, who overcame Chelsea and Bradford City.\n\nI'd love to think Macclesfield could do it too, and if they play like they did against Palace then they have a great chance, especially on their plastic pitch.\n\nI think Brentford will be ready for them, though, and Keith Andrews' side are having a tremendous season too.\n\nAndrews will know he can't make too many changes here, and maybe Brentford will go on an FA Cup run themselves - they have not reached the quarter-finals since 1989, so it it is long overdue.\n\nThis is going to be a tight game but I just have a feeling the Bees will edge it.\n\nDaffy: I don't underthtand thith game at all – what is a Maccle? Why are there fields of them? And why do you altho call them the Thilkmen? Jutht for that, I'm going with Brentford!\n\nPorky: B-b-Bees make honey, And honey is sweet... and so is my d-d-dear-d-d-arling Petunia.\n\nDaffy & Porky's prediction: 0-3\n\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

    "fullText": "A lot can change in sport over two decades - but not Arianna Fontana's ability to collect Olympic medals.\n\nShe had to settle for silver in the women's 500m as the title she won in 2018 and 2022 was taken by Netherlands' Xandra Velzeboer.\n\nIt was Fontana's second medal of these Games, after she helped Italy win the mixed team relay earlier this week.\n\nThe 35-year-old - the only woman to have finished on the podium in six consecutive Winter Games - now has 13 medals, equalling the tally of fencer Edoardo Mangiarotti as her country's all-time record holder at an Olympics.\n\nFontana has won at least one medal in every Olympic short track distance.\n\nIt was a magnificent full-circle - or full-oval speed skating track – moment for Fontana after she also won her first Olympic medal at a home Games - Turin 2006 - as a 15-year-old.\n\n\"I had no idea what was happening!\" Fontana told the BBC's More Than The Score podcast last week of that 2006 bronze in the 3000m relay.\n\n\"I was just living the dream. I was too young to really understand what it meant to be on the Olympic podium. Then when I went home, I had my whole hometown waiting for me.\n\n\"I am fortunate to have a home Olympics, because in Turin I couldn't really understand. To be home in Milan, it is my home region.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWhile an unknown teenager in Turin, she is one of the faces of this year's Games 20 years on. Fontana carried the Italian flag at the opening ceremony at San Siro, leading the home nation as tens of thousands of compatriots cheered in the crowd.\n\nIt was the second time Fontana was honoured to be the opening ceremony flagbearer, having also carried the flag at Pyeongchang 2018.\n\nOn how she has kept winning Olympic medals and maintained her place at the top end of speed skating since before Instagram was invented, Fontana says it comes down to a love of the sport - and a love of herself.\n\n\"I do have experience, but I have the same drive I did when I was 15. I never get on the ice just to show up,\" she added.\n\n\"With time, I have been able to understand my body, and my mental fitness - I have taken more time off from racing, more breaks, because mentally it can be tough.\n\n\"Elite athletes, we put pressure on ourselves easily, we have high expectation and it can be hard mentally.\"\n\nShe needed that mental fortitude in the build-up to the Games as a series of injuries - including a hip issue in October - hampered her preparations.\n\nIt put paid to Fontana's plan to also enter long track events, forcing her to concentrate on her signature shorter disciplines.\n\nIt was a decision she took with her coach and husband Anthony Lobello after spending four years travelling the world to various competitions.\n\n\"We understand each other, he understands exactly what I need,\" said Fontana. \"We do try not to talk about work at home.\"\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nShe needed all her nous on Thursday night. In the semi-final, as chaos unfurled all around her at the start - including medal rival Michelle Velzeboer falling - she kept her focus and skated a clean race.\n\nAnd in the final, Fontana needed running repairs to one of her skates after a first-corner collision with Selma Poutsma meant the race was restarted.\n\nBut she kept her nerve and held off late pressure from Poutsma and Courtney Sarault to make it lucky 13.\n\nA good job, then, that she pushed away all nagging feelings that this might have been one Games too many.\n\nFontana admitted: \"Sooner or later you are going to retire, and I have spoken to athletes who have. You just feel it, you give it all, then it is time to move on.\n\n\"For sure, having the Olympic Games in Italy was another motivation, if it was in another country, I don't know.\n\n\"But I didn't have that feeling I was done.\"",

    "fullText": "SAO PAULO, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Brazil's cattle slaughtering activity for the fourth quarter shows beef packers boosted processing by 13.1% ‌from the same period in 2024, according to preliminary Brazilian census bureau ‌data released on Thursday.\n\nThe tally, if confirmed, would take Brazil's total slaughtering to 42.3 million head ​in 2025, a record, as strong Chinese demand drove an acceleration of processing and put Brazil ahead of the United States as the world's biggest beef producer.\n\nBrazil's government trade data indicates Chinese demand remained strong in January, with $650 million worth ‌of beef shipments to the ⁠Asian nation last month, almost 45% more than a year ago.\n\nOverall, Brazil sold some 232,000 metric tonnes of fresh beef ⁠to multiple destinations in 2025, generating almost $1.3 billion in revenue. China's share of Brazil's beef trade was roughly half, by value and volume.\n\nGoing forward, however, Brazilian companies may ​not ​be selling as much to their top trade ​partner, as Beijing introduced maximum annual ‌import quotas for suppliers over three years. Anything exceeding a certain threshold will be levied a 55% tariff.\n\nChina's \"safeguard measures\" spooked local processors. But as Beijing is unwavering, the Brazilian government is now discussing with the industry a plan to assign specific quotas to companies, in the same proportion as their exports to ‌China last year, to regulate supplies.\n\nDefenders of ​the move argue it could avoid upward pressure ​on cattle prices, or a ​fall of beef export prices, as local companies rush to ‌export to China to fill their quota ​faster than others. ​Detractors say it may allow unprecedented meddling with food exports.\n\nBeijing will exempt 1.106 million metric tons of Brazilian beef from additional tariffs this year. ​On average, local exporters ‌would sell some 92,000 tons monthly to China under the threshold, ​which compares with nearly 140,000 tons monthly in 2025.",

    "fullText": "Before retiring, you must know your investment account balance.\n\nIt’s important to also know how much Social Security income you will receive.\n\nFinally, you need to know how much you plan to spend to make sure your income will cover your costs.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nAre you ready to retire or not? It can be difficult to answer this question. However, there are three key numbers that you need to look at which will tell you everything that you need to know about whether you are ready to retire.\n\nThe first big number that you need to know is your investment account balance. That's the amount of money that you have set aside in your 401(k), IRA, and taxable brokerage accounts. You must know this number because the money from these accounts will supplement your Social Security income.\n\nYou can't live on Social Security alone, so you should have additional savings to help you pay the bills as a retiree. Once you know the total amount you have invested, you can determine how much income your accounts will provide.\n\nExperts recommend withdrawing 3.7% of your account balance in your first year of retirement. So, if you have, say $850K in your investment accounts, you would multiply that number to determine that you would have $31,450 per year in income from savings to spend.\n\nThe next big number that you must know is the amount of your Social Security benefit. Your Social Security payment is also going to be a crucial source of retirement income and, unlike your savings, this source of funds is guaranteed to last for life and has built-in protections against inflation.\n\nYour  Social Security benefit is designed to replace around 40% of your pre-retirement income. However, for some people, it will replace more and for others, it won't replace as much Higher earners have a lower portion of their earnings replaced as the benefits formula is progressive. Your age when you claim benefits also matters, as those who file for benefits before their full retirement age are faced with penalties for early filing while those who delay past FRA get delayed retirement credits that increase benefits.\n\nWhether you claim earlier or late is going to depend on your financial situation, as well as whether you would prefer more smaller checks or fewer larger checks. If you expect a long life expectancy or need your spouse to receive a large survivor's benefit, then a delayed claim is also advisable.",

    "description": "Arsenal are four points clear at the top of the Premier League with 12 games to play - but will recent history repeat itself?",
    "fullText": "The pressure in the title race was always going to come for Arsenal, and maybe after the 1-1 draw at Brentford this is where it turns up a notch for Mikel Arteta's side.\n\nIt must be pointed out that they are in the best position of all clubs chasing the title, four points clear at the top of the Premier League and with just three losses all season. But with Pep Guardiola's Manchester City the side chasing them, that gap does not feel huge.\n\nPart of that is down to the fact that if Arsenal had beaten the Bees they would have been six points clear and had the chance to extend that to nine points with a win over Wolves next Wednesday, with the game taking place before Manchester City are next in action.\n\nAnother factor is that Manchester City have produced incredible runs of form to chase down titles in previous years and the Gunners have finished second for three successive seasons.\n\nWith 12 games to go, history does not favour Arsenal with their end-of-season form.\n\nIn the past five seasons, only on one occasion have Arsenal won 10 of their final 12 Premier League matches in a campaign.\n\nIn those seasons, the Gunners have never won more points in their final 12 games than the team that went on to win the title.\n\nLeaders Arsenal frustrated in draw at Brentford\n\nWith the noise around Arsenal and their history under Arteta when trying to win the title, the Gunners boss was asked if he needs to ensure that his side do not panic and remain focused on their task.\n\n\"That's what we have to do,\" he said. \"I mean we are going to be willing and preparing to win every single match and the only thing that we can do is focus on that and raise the levels collectively and individually to be better than the opponent every week.\n\n\"It's just the things that we have to do, that's the most important thing.\"\n\nBefore Manchester City's dramatic win against Liverpool on Sunday, it looked as though Arsenal would be nine points clear.\n\nBut after Erling Haaland's late penalty to secure the three points and their win against Fulham on Wednesday, the gap was reduced to three points and the pressure was put back on to the Gunners.\n\nWhen asked if playing after City is bringing a new pressure to his team, Arteta said: \"I don't think so, I think we played well after them a few times this season and we have won games.\"\n\nOf the 17 games in which Arsenal have scored first in the Premier League this season, the draw at Brentford was just the second time they have failed to win, along with their loss to Manchester United in January.\n\nMidfielder Declan Rice could not have put it better: \"This is a rollercoaster of a season.\n\n\"You can't be naive to think this is going to be easy. We are playing against the best teams week in, week out. We have to keep pushing and believing in ourselves, controlling the controllables.\n\n\"We have to block out the outside noise. We have done that really well. People are going to talk up the title race and Arsenal but we have a really calm group.\"\n\nThe Gunners came into this match without centre-back William Saliba, who missed out through illness.\n\nSaliba is a key part of this Arsenal side and his partnership with Gabriel Magalhaes is a big reason why they have conceded just 18 goals in the league this season.\n\nSince the start of 2022-23, Arsenal have a 68.6% win rate and average 2.3 points per game with Saliba playing in the Premier League (W83 D24 L14), compared to a 42.1% win rate and 1.6 points per game on average without him (W8 D7 L4).\n\nThe Gunners are also without Kai Havertz, who has picked up a muscle injury after only just returning from a long-term knee issue last month.\n\nAs well as those two changes, Arteta brought Viktor Gyokeres and Piero Hincapie into the starting XI at Brentford.\n\nBut the Gunners have only won two of the past seven Premier League games in which they've made four or more changes to their starting XI from the previous match (D4 L1).\n\nFormer Arsenal defender Martin Keown said on TNT Sports: \"That's what people were shouting at me as I was coming off the pitch, 'Man City are coming to get you', but at the end of the day Arsenal are four points clear.\n\n\"You get knocked down, you get up again. Let's see who the fighters are and let's see who is going to win this. They could have put down a big marker if they won the match, but it never looked like that was going to be the case.\"\n\nIn two of their three second-placed finishes in recent years, Arsenal have finished behind Manchester City, which is why the talk about this title race carries so many emotional scars for supporters.\n\n\"What Man City have got is the know-how and the recent history behind them,\" Peter Crouch added on TNT.\n\n\"That can lead to nervous tensions around the stadium, certainly around the back end of the season.\n\n\"Having someone like Man City and Pep behind you, you are always going to be looking over your shoulder. But you would much rather be in Arsenal's position.\"\n\nCrouch believes Arsenal will never have a better chance to win the title.\n\n\"Man City are not the Man City of old, Liverpool aren't, Manchester United aren't what they have been, Chelsea the same,\" he said. \"There is a lack of quality in the top areas [of the league]. The bar has been set high in the past years.\n\n\"Now is a real opportunity for Arsenal. If they don't get over the line, there needs to be more questions answered.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Thomas Tuchel says he extended his contract as England manager through to Euro 2028 because of the \"amazing group of players\" at his disposal.\n\nThe German took charge in January 2025 and his time as Three Lions boss had originally been set to end after this summer's World Cup.\n\nHowever, the 52-year-old admitted his \"connection to the players and to the job itself\" had grown as England claimed eight wins from eight matches to waltz through qualifying for the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States.\n\n\"The main reasons I took the job in the first place were the players,\" Tuchel said.\n\n\"I wanted to be around this amazing group of players. I wanted to coach these characters that I already knew from the Premier League.\n\n\"I love the group of players. I love the characters, I love being in charge. I felt the passion in the country when the Euros were held at Wembley. From there it was more a dream than a reality.\n\n\"I'm very grateful for the support and trust of the FA and we will put all the effort in to make everyone proud and to keep on going.\"\n\nWhen Tuchel accepted the England job, it was his first incursion into the international arena.\n\nHaving enjoyed success with the likes of Borussia Dortmund, Paris St-Germain, Chelsea and Bayern Munich, he has adapted seamlessly to a different type of challenge away from the day-to-day issues he faced at clubs.\n\n\"We didn't know exactly what was coming as an international manager,\" Tuchel added.\n\n\"It was basically the point why I voted strongly for only 18 months contract in the first place, because I said 'Listen, I have never done this. Can I first make sure that I love this and that I feel committed to the team, and I feel connected to the team', because I think that is needed to be the best version of myself.\n\n\"It took me some months to understand it but as soon as the more condensed period arrived in September, October, November, it was the period where I felt the strongest connection to the players and to the job itself. And from there on I was fully committed to go even further.\"\n\nWith the 2028 European Championship finals being hosted by England, Wales, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, the temptation of leading a side into a home Euros, with the Football Association keen to back their man, also proved an irresistible reason for Tuchel to stay on.\n\n\"We had an excellent qualifying campaign, and both sides wanted to complete the cycle,\" he added.\n\n\"We wanted to commit further to a full cycle of World Cup and Euros. The FA wanted and I wanted so it was an easy one.\"\n\nWhile some may draw parallels to the situation England faced after handing Fabio Capello a lucrative new deal prior to 2010 World Cup in South Africa, there can be no question that the FA's move does at least provide some continuity and clarity in the short to medium term.\n\nHaving been strongly linked with Manchester United, where Michael Carrick is in charge until the end of the season, both Tuchel and the FA appear content to have removed any potential distractions heading into the World Cup.\n\n\"It didn't have to be done, but it was a very positive, very welcome side-effect of it,\" Tuchel added.\n\n\"It was the opposite, very important for me that we don't do it just to have clarity in the World Cup, but we do it if we are convinced, and [FA CEO] Mark Bullingham especially made this very clear from the beginning.\n\n\"But it is, no doubt, a very welcome side-effect that we have clarity, no more speculation, no more rumours.\n\n\"There was no reason to be worried because I was obviously totally focused through the qualification period and right after that we started the talks. I was always committed to this idea of extending the contract, the FA were always committed - there were no games, no second thoughts.\n\n\"There is a possibility that I will be tempted to go back to club football but not in the next two-and-a-half years.\"\n\nWith question marks removed over his own future, Tuchel will soon have to navigate the recurring issues his predecessors have faced leading England into major tournaments.\n\nThat includes managing expectation levels and selection connundrums that appear to be commonplace whenever England are readying themselves for a World Cup or Euros.\n\nAnd he appears to be relishing the prospect of making those decisions with Manchester United trio Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw all likely to come into his thinking, having not featured under the German so far.\n\nA change of manager and system has allowed Mainoo - a starter in the Euro 2024 final - to showcase his talent again after he was mystifyingly banished from United's starting XI under former boss Ruben Amorim.\n\nMeanwhile, Shaw and Maguire have impressed under Carrick, with Tuchel assessing all three players in United's 1-1 draw at West Ham on Tuesday.\n\nWhen questioned about Mainoo, Tuchel continued: \"Absolutely back in the frame! First of all, it is great that he is back on the pitch. He is such a huge talent.\n\n\"He has already played a tournament from start to finish for England, so he is back in the picture, so is Luke Shaw and so is Harry Maguire.\n\n\"There are some players suddenly back in the picture, they play a back four now and play with a different style which is a bit easier to translate to our structure at the moment. It's good competition.\"",

    "description": "Seventeen-year-old Choi Ga-on denies American great Chloe Kim snowboarding history as she brushes off an early fall to win Winter Olympic halfpipe gold.",
    "fullText": "It felt like the moment the baton was passed on.\n\nChloe Kim, the greatest women's halfpipe snowboarder, and Choi Ga-on, the young protege, standing side by side on the podium.\n\nIt was expected to be a procession for American Kim to win a third consecutive Winter Olympic gold, a feat no snowboarder has ever achieved. And yet it was 17-year-old Choi on the top step at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe South Korean had defied a brutal fall in her opening run to score 90.25 points on her final attempt, a total 25-year-old Kim could not better.\n\nIt was, as Kim told BBC Sport, a \"full circle moment\".\n\nThe two had met nine years ago, at a test event in Pyeongchang before the 2018 Games in which Kim, then also aged 17, would announce herself on a global stage with her first Olympic gold.\n\nRealising her potential, Kim and her father helped Choi to travel to the United States to train.\n\nKim's father, who is from South Korea, was one of the first to embrace Choi and her emotional team after her Olympic gold was confirmed.\n\n\"She's someone I've known since she was little,\" said Kim.\n\n\"It's such a full circle moment seeing her from when she was so young to now standing next to her on the Olympic podium.\"\n\nOlympic gold in Italy marks the realisation of Choi's potential, a name that has been on the lips of many in the snowboard world for some time but is now catapulted into global consciousness.\n\nIn 2023, aged just 14, Choi won X Games superpipe gold, breaking Kim's record as the youngest rider to win the title.\n\nThat same year, she won the first World Cup she entered but was later ruled out of the remainder of that season after fracturing her back.\n\nThis Olympic season, however, she underlined her ability by winning every World Cup she entered coming into the Games.\n\nShe had managed only sixth in qualification on Wednesday as Kim topped the pile with a score of 90.25 - the exact score Choi would win gold with little more than 24 hours later.\n\nBut her final looked to be over on her very first run when she hit the icy lip of the pipe and flipped into its centre, lying motionless for some time.\n\nAs heavy snow fell, she eventually brushed herself down and later stunned the onlooking crowd with her spellbinding third run, her coach bursting into tears at the realisation of what Choi had achieved.\n\n\"It's the kind of story you only see in dreams, so I'm incredibly happy,\" said Choi.\n\n\"During the final, mentally it was so tough. But right now I am the happiest.\n\n\"My knees are a bit bad, but I feel like I'm overcoming it all with happiness.\"\n\nShe later said: \"After the first run, I actually cried really hard, thinking maybe I should just quit the Olympics here.\n\n\"I cried because I thought I wouldn't be able to compete. But the thought kept coming back to me: 'You can do this. You have to go on'. That's what pushed me forward.\"\n\nFor Kim, the build-up to the Games had been far from ideal.\n\nWith just one competition under her belt this season, she dislocated her shoulder and sustained a torn labrum in what she described as the \"silliest fall\" in training in Switzerland last month.\n\nIn Livigno she was competing with her shoulder in a brace but showed little sign of it affecting her.\n\nWatched on by Team USA 'honorary coach' Snoop Dogg and snowboarding legend Shaun White in Thursday's final, the eight-time X Games champion had looked set for gold after her opening run scored 88.00, with few coming close.\n\nBut Choi's last score, met by both cheers and gasps of shock from the onlooking crowd, piled the pressure on Kim, only for a fall - one of many in what was a chaotic final - to ensure she would leave an Olympics with silver for the very first time.\n\nJapan's Mitsuki Ono took bronze with a score of 85.00.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport, Kim - who will now have surgery on her shoulder - said: \"I'm so proud of myself.\n\n\"There was a lot of conversation about me [attempting to win a third gold] but honestly I'm just so glad I was able to get here.\n\n\"I think this one might mean more than the others. I think I put it all out there.\n\n\"In the past, I would take a cautious approach and ride to win, but these days I've just wanted to do what felt good and I feel like I really gave it my all.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Gerwyn Price ended Michael van Gerwen's unbeaten start to the Premier League by claiming a 6-3 victory in night two's final in Antwerp.\n\nVan Gerwen won the season opener in Newcastle last week and beat Luke Littler in the semis on his way to another final.\n\nBut the seven-time champion was no match for Welshman Price, who had come through two final-leg deciders before lifting the title in more comfortable fashion.\n\nLittler had earlier opened the tournament's first visit to Belgium by edging a final-leg decider of his own against rival Luke Humphries.\n\nFor Price it was a welcome victory to confirm the fine form he had been in of late.\n\n\"I think I'm playing some of the best stuff I've played, I'm just not winning tournaments,\" Price told Sky Sports after his victory.\n\n\"There's no way I can't win a major, bigger Pro Tours, Europeans. Averages are just for show and if you play well on your darts and win matches you win tournaments. I'm going to get some.\"\n\nThe PDC Premier League visited Belgium for the first time in the competition's 21-year history, and the 10,000 darts fanatics inside the AFAS Dome were treated to plenty of thrills.\n\nPremier League Darts 2026 fixtures, results and table\n\nPremier League: Price beats Van Gerwen to win Antwerp final - as it happened\n\nThe night started with a bang as the two biggest darts stars in the world played out a high-quality contest that went down to a final-leg decider.\n\nHumphries and Littler both hit seven 180s and averaged over 102 and 105 respectively, but both were surprisingly poor on the outer ring - missing 28 doubles between them.\n\nHumphries was the better player throughout, but at 4-1 up he started missing doubles badly, 17 in all by the end of the match, as Littler engineered an escape to make it five straight wins against his big rival.\n\nWorld number two Humphries has now lost 11 of his 15 Premier League meetings with Littler, with his last victory of any kind against the 19-year-old coming in the tournament's final last May.\n\nThe past four defeats before this one came in tournament finals, and perhaps it is becoming a mental barrier now for the defending Premier League champion as his scoring was solid all game, but he could just not get over the line.\n\nComebacks were a theme of the opening quarter-finals with all bar Van Gerwen's stroll against an out-of-sorts Josh Rock filled with excitement.\n\nStephen Bunting finished bottom of the table last year after failing to win a single match in the first eight weeks, but looked to have one sewn up when leading 4-0, only to watch Jonny Clayton reel off six straight legs to win 6-4.\n\nAnd Price had to come from 3-1 and 4-2 down to beat Gian van Veen in the first of his two 6-5 victories on the night.\n\nPrice's second final-leg decider came against good friend and Wales World Cup team-mate Clayton in a nip-and-tuck battle.\n\nPrice had four 180s to Clayton's three and averaged just over 100 - but was forced to win the final two legs under extreme pressure to make the final.\n\nIt was no real surprise given Price had won nine in a row against his compatriot and 15 of their past 16 meetings.\n\nVan Gerwen did not impress in his opener but certainly did in a strange 6-4 victory over Littler where seven of the 10 legs went against the darts.\n\nThe Dutchman averaged just over 100 with an off-colour Littler down at 95 and - strangely for him - only managing a single maximum, while Van Gerwen hit four.\n\nBut it was the finishing under pressure that made the difference as the Dutchman hit six of 13 attempts at a double, including finishing off a 10-darter, in a performance that was much more like the Van Gerwen of old.\n\nDespite incredible back-to-back finishes of 167 and 160 in the final Van Gerwen was always second best, but a win and a final after two nights is a great start considering he failed to win a single night in last season's competition.\n\nThe results also leave Littler and Humphries in fifth and sixth in the table with just one win each, but there is no panic just yet with 14 weeks of fixtures remaining.\n\nThursday, 12 February - FAS Dome, Antwerp\n\nLuke Littler 6-5 Luke Humphries\n\nMichael van Gerwen 6-2 Josh Rock\n\nJonny Clayton 6-4 Stephen Bunting\n\nPremier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night.\n\nEach of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.\n\nPlayers earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.\n\nThe top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.\n\nIf players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.\n\nThursday, 19 February - OVO Hydro, Glasgow\n\nStephen Bunting v Gian van Veen\n\nMichael van Gerwen v Luke Littler\n\nBunting/Van Veen v Humphries/Rock\n\nVan Gerwen/Littler v Clayton/Price\n\nBunting/Van Veen/Humphries/Rock v Van Gerwen/Littler/Clayton/Price",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Feb 12 (Reuters) - China's chief trade negotiator Li Chenggang met Mexico's Deputy Economy Minister Vidal Llerenas in Beijing on Monday, in ‌the first face-to-face talks since Mexico imposed higher tariffs on Chinese imports, ‌drawing warnings from Beijing.\n\nThe two countries conducted in-depth exchanges on bilateral economic and trade relations and ​other issues, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nHow do USMCA negotiations affect Chinese investment plans?\n\nHow might China respond to Mexico's tariff increases?\n\nWhy did Mexico impose higher tariffs on China?\n\nWhat impact could tariffs have on China-Mexico trade?\n\nMexico announced in December steep tariff increases on China and other countries without free trade agreements with Mexico - most up to 35%. The move was widely interpreted by analysts as an attempt ‌to placate U.S. President Donald ⁠Trump, who levied significant tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nMexico's duties apply to thousands of goods including automobiles, auto parts, textiles, clothing, plastics and ⁠steel.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the tariffs are intended to increase domestic production and address trade imbalances. The tariffs are expected to have the biggest impact on China, which ​is Mexico's ​second-largest trading partner after the United States.\n\nChina's ​Commerce Ministry had warned Mexico to \"think ‌twice\" before levying tariffs and said it would take steps in response to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, but it has so far not announced countermeasures.\n\nSeparately, China's top automaker BYD said in 2024 it was considering setting up a factory in Mexico, although the FT reported in March that China was delaying approval for ‌the plant over concerns of technology leakage to ​the United States.\n\nThe China-Mexico talks come as the ​U.S., Mexico and Canada prepare to ​jointly review their free trade agreement by July 1.\n\nThe U.S.' top ‌trade negotiator has said the pact ​is not equipped to ​deal with surges of exports and investment from non-market economies such as China into the region, suggesting the U.S. may press for tighter rules on ​China-origin goods in a ‌new agreement. That would make it harder for Chinese firms to use ​Mexico as a base for exporting to the U.S.",

You know, October 10th there was a flash crash.\n\nAnd we're we've had flash crashes in the traditional markets. I was in the hedge fund business in the old world for 25 years. I saw many flash crashes. They're normal.\n\nAnd in crypto, you've have flash crashes all the time. It used to be, I don't know if you remember but in 2016, 17, 18, Coinbase would go down and people would say, oh, Coinbase is down and you would have a flash crash.\n\nAnd so we had a very severe moment on October 10th that is yet to be sort of resolved. The person who was maybe forced to liquidate, uh or the entity that was forced to liquidate, uh it seems is still, uh, is still liquidating. Maybe there is an entity, maybe there isn't. We don't know, but I think um there has to be sort of a capitulative moment, a moment of realization where people say, oh my goodness,\n\nit's over. And we've already been seeing that, oh Bitcoin's going to zero. Someone asked me the other day at dinner whether Bitcoin was going to zero. Um, so it's sort of unfortunate, but that's sort of the way markets work. And unfortunately with this specific crypto blockchain market, you have a lot of individuals, a lot of retail of non-professional investor.",

    "fullText": "Oklahoma City residents may have driven by the intersection of north Western Avenue and NW 192nd Street and wondered what’s being constructed there.\n\nBraum’s in January 2025 filed a permit at 1021 NW 192nd Street to build what will be one of the larger stores in its footprint.\n\nAccording to permits filed with the City of Oklahoma City, Braum’s is building a nearly 6,500-square-foot store. It’s a job with an estimated value of $2.5 million, the permit shows.\n\nThere are 326 Braum's stores in the U.S. as of Feb. 11, and Oklahoma has 146 of them, or about 45% of all locations nationally, data provided by the company.\n\nWith most Braum’s stores ranging from 5,500-6,500 square feet, the location being built on 192nd Street would be one of the largest in Oklahoma.\n\nThe Express Star reported in 2021 that Braum’s opened the largest location in Oklahoma at 3001 S. Sara Rd. The report states that location is just under 6,500 square feet, with seating for about 70 guests and an outdoor covered patio that accommodates roughly 40 patrons.\n\nThe 192nd Street location is of comparable size at 6,456 square feet.\n\nBraum’s leadership, according to reports, has increased the size of new stores since the 2000s to accommodate their expanded Fresh Market grocery sections, which feature wider aisles and an increased variety of product options.\n\nThe markets inside the stores are among the qualities that separate the brand from other fast-food options.\n\nThe layout seen in Yukon and in Wolfforth, Texas, dedicates more than 1,600 square feet to the market area alone. Both of those locations have 16.5-foot ceilings, the largest in the company’s footprint.\n\nBraum's Public Relations Director Amanda Beuchaw said the new store in Oklahoma City will be the same store model as seen in Yukon and just outside of Lubbock, Texas.\n\n\"The (store size) mostly has to do with the lot size,\" Beuchaw said. \"If the lot is big enough to support it, they love to use the big model as much as they can because they really like the look and aesthetic of that model. But it has to do with the lot being able support that size of a store as well as the parking lot and the spaces needed.\"\n\nBeuchaw said the company hopes to open the new location sometime before June 2026, but that will ultimately depend on weather and material delays, among other factors.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Oklahoman: Oklahoma City's new Braum's store will be one of the largest in the state",

    "description": "The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family.",
    "fullText": "The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family. The decision likely ends a bitter, yearslong legal battle over the girl's fate.\n\nIn 2020, a judge in Fluvanna County, Virginia, granted Joshua and Stephanie Mast an adoption of the child, who was then 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan living with a family the Afghan government decided were her relatives.\n\nFour justices on the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday signed onto an opinion reversing two lower courts’ rulings that found the adoption was so flawed it was void from the moment it was issued.\n\nThe justices wrote that a Virginia law that cements adoption orders after six months bars the child’s Afghan relatives from challenging the court, no matter how flawed its orders and even if the adoption was obtained by fraud.\n\nThree justices issued a scathing dissent, calling what happened in this court “wrong,” “cancerous” and “like a house built on a rotten foundation.”\n\nAn attorney for the Masts declined to comment, citing an order from the circuit court not to discuss the details of the case publicly. Lawyers representing the Afghan family said they were not yet prepared to comment.\n\nThe child was injured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in September 2019 when U.S. soldiers raided a rural compound. The child’s parents and siblings were killed. Soldiers brought her to a hospital at an American military base.\n\nThe raid was targeting terrorists who had come into Afghanistan from a neighboring country; some believed she was not Afghan and tried to make a case for bringing her to the U.S. But the State Department, under President Donald Trump’s first administration, insisted the U.S. was obligated under international law to work with the Afghan government and the International Committee of the Red Cross to unite the child with her closest surviving relatives.\n\nThe Afghan government determined she was Afghan and vetted a man who claimed to be her uncle. The U.S. government agreed and brought her to the family. The uncle chose to give her to his son and his new wife, who raised her for 18 months in Afghanistan.\n\nMeanwhile, Mast and his wife convinced courts in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia, to grant them custody and then a series of adoption orders, continuing to claim she was the “stateless” daughter of foreign fighters.\n\nJudge Richard Moore granted them a final adoption in December 2020. When the six-month statute of limitations ran out, the child was still in Afghanistan living with her relatives, who testified they had no idea a judge was giving the girl to another family. Mast contacted them through intermediaries and tried to get them to send the girl to the U.S. for medical treatment but they refused to let her go alone.\n\nWhen the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban took over, the family agreed to leave and Mast worked his military contacts to get them on an evacuation flight. Mast then took the baby from them at a refugee resettlement center in Virginia, and they haven’t seen her since.\n\nThe AP agreed not to name the Afghan couple because they fear their families in Afghanistan might face retaliation from the Taliban. The circuit court issued a protective order shielding their identities.\n\nThe Afghans challenged the adoption, claiming the court had no authority over a foreign child and the adoption orders were based on Mast repeatedly misleading the judge.\n\nThe Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday wrote that the law prohibiting challenges to an adoption after six months is designed to create permanency, so a child is not bounced from one home to another. The only way to undercut it is to argue that a parent’s constitutional rights were violated.\n\nThe lower courts had found that the Afghan couple had a right to challenge the adoption because they were the girl’s “de facto” parents when they came to the United States.\n\nFour of the Supreme Court judges — D. Arthur Kelsey, Stephen R. McCullough, Teresa M. Chafin, Wesley G. Russell Jr. — disagreed.\n\n“We find no legal merit” in the argument that “that they were ‘de facto’ parents of the child and that no American court could constitutionally sever that relationship,” they wrote. They pointed to Fluvanna County Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore’s findings that the Afghan couple “are not and never were parents” of the child, because they had no order from an Afghan court and had not proven any biological relationship to her.\n\nThe Afghans had refused DNA testing, saying it could not reliably prove a familial connection between opposite-gender half-cousins. They insisted that it didn't matter, because Afghanistan claimed the girl as its citizen and got to determine her next-of-kin.\n\nThe Supreme Court leaned heavily on a 38-page document written by Judge Moore, who granted the adoption, then presided over a dozen hearings after the Afghans challenged it. He wrote that he trusted the Masts more than the Afghans, and believed that the Masts’ motivations were noble while the Afghans were misrepresenting their relationship to the child.\n\nThe Supreme Court also dismissed the federal government’s long insistence that Trump’s first administration had made a foreign policy decision to unite her with her Afghan relatives, and a court in Virginia has no authority to undo it. The government submitted filings in court predicting dire outcomes if the baby was allowed to remain with the Marine: it could be viewed as “endorsing an act of international child abduction,” threaten international security pacts and be used as propaganda by Islamic extremists — potentially endangering U.S soldiers overseas.\n\nBut the Justice Department in Trump’s second administration abruptly changed course.\n\nThe Supreme Court noted in its opinion that the Justice Department had been granted permission to make arguments in the case, but withdrew its request to do so on the morning of oral arguments last year, saying it “has now had an opportunity to reevaluate its position in this case.”\n\nThe Supreme Court returned repeatedly to Moore’s finding that giving the girl to the family “was not a decision the United States initiated, but rather consented to or acquiesced in.”\n\nThe three judges who dissented were unsparing in their criticism of both the Masts and the circuit court that granted him the adoption.\n\n“A dispassionate review of this case reveals a scenario suffused with arrogance and privilege. Worse, it appears to have worked,” begins the dissent, written by Justice Thomas P. Mann, and signed by Chief Justice Cleo E. Powell and LeRoy F. Millette, Jr.\n\nA Virginia court never had the right to give the child to the Masts, the dissent said.\n\nThey castigated the Masts for “brazenly” misleading the courts during their quest to adopt the girl.\n\n“We must recognize what an adoption really is: the severance and termination of the rights naturally flowing to an otherwise legitimate claimant to parental authority. Of course, the process must be impeccable. An evolved society could not sanction anything less than that. And here, it was less,” Mann wrote. “If this process was represented by a straight line, (the Masts) went above it, under it, around it, and then blasted right through it until there was no line at all — just fragments collapsing into a cavity.”",
