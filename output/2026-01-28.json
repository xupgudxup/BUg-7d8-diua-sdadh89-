    "description": "Comment: UFC 325 is headlined by a rematch that few are craving, with the UFC overlooking fresh challengers to featherweight king Volkanovski",
    "fullText": "When in a bind, sanction a rematch. It’s an easy solution for bookers, leaning back into a pre-made rivalry and billing it as its second coming. There’s a score to be settled, et cetera.\n\nBut not every feud needs to be run back. Such is the case with UFC 325’s main event on Saturday 31 January, which pits two-time featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski against Diego Lopes, nine months on from their first bout. Back then, there was a lot to be excited about.\n\nVolkanovski was returning to the cage for the first time since being flatlined by Ilia Topuria, who brutally ended the Aussie’s legendary reign at 145lb. The gold had since been left vacant by “El Matador”, who’d jumped up to pursue (and swiftly achieve) similar glory at lightweight, giving Volkanovski a chance to reclaim his crown. But at 36, that redemption story was hardly a foregone conclusion. Back-to-back knockout losses, one to Topuria and the other to pound-for-pound king Islam Makhachev up a weight class, sparked fears that “Alexander The Great” was over the hill.\n\nRetirement was now a not-so-distant possibility for Volkanovski and as he squared off against Lopes, a 30-year-old jiu-jitsu specialist who had stormed through the division to earn a title shot, it felt like a gut-wrenching passing of the torch could be upon us.\n\nInstead, facing a boom-or-bust scenario, Volkanovski proved he still had it in abundance. Barring a flash knockdown in the second round, the former – and now reigning – champion outfought the Mexican-Brazilian for a convincing decision win, with prevailing opinion dictating that Volkanovski ended the fight with four rounds to Lopes’s one. “Adversity is a privilege,” he declared.\n\nAfter a fun fight and feel-good win for a fan favourite, this chapter looked ready to be closed. Yet here we are, staring down the barrel of a rematch not many – other than Lopes and his camp – particularly craved.\n\n“If you don’t like it, then don’t watch it,” said UFC president Dana White, responding to backlash over his booking of the featherweight title. A typically barbed response from White, his dismissal of wider fan sentiment – the litmus test of whether his product is living up to expectations – is the root of the company’s matchmaking problem.\n\nThe illusion that the UFC is a meritocracy may be long shattered but not only were there more interesting fights to make than Volkanovski vs Lopes 2, there were arguably more deserving challengers.\n\nStaving off British bias, Manchester’s own Lerone Murphy had a very valid case to be fighting for the belt next. Undefeated at 17-0-1, “The Miracle” is coming off his knockout-of-the-year win over hot property Aaron Pico at UFC 319, which saw him sleep the debutant with a stunning spinning back elbow on late notice. With wins over Josh Emmett, Dan Ige and Edson Barboza already under his belt, this performance acted as a title statement – something recognised by champion Volkanovski, who said it was a “no-brainer” to give Murphy a shot at the gold.\n\nYet he was overlooked, so we go to another contender. In fact, we go to the No 1 contender. Movsar Evloev, similarly undefeated at 19-0, has climbed the ladder from gatekeeper to former champion and beaten everyone on the way up. A relentless wrestler, his resume includes the scalps of Ige, Arnold Allen and Saturday’s challenger-in-question Lopes, with his most-recent win coming against ex-bantamweight king Aljamain Sterling.\n\nHowever, that fight was in December 2024. The Russian did not compete in 2025, with a slated bout against Pico for July falling through due to an injury. His inactivity would act as reasoning why White turned focus away from his top featherweight contender, though time out of the cage has not stopped fighters from being thrown immediately into the title picture. Ask Jon Jones, Colby Covington, Tyron Woodley, the list goes on.\n\nSterling was also an option, offering that champion-versus-champion angle, but Murphy and Evloev would have each felt they should have been the fresh challenge for Volkanovski that fans are desiring. By snubbing them both, a natural match-up looks set to be made: Murphy vs Evloev, probably at UFC London. It’s a great fight, but one that creates another headache for the UFC.\n\nWhen one gets their arm raised, the other’s title credibility will diminish. This is not what’s needed for a featherweight division growing lighter after the departures of Ilia Topuria and Max Holloway. Volkanovski might be next, and soon. Stars must be built at 145lb rather than snuffed out.\n\nThe former may transpire at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena if Lopes can dethrone Volkanovski in what might be the Aussie hero’s last act in the UFC. He was handily bested nine months ago but with both men a year older, Saturday could go very differently for the challenger, who bounced back in style to finish the dangerous Jean Silva in September.\n\nBut it feels like either way, the UFC have booked themselves into a hole when they really didn’t need to. Featherweight is regularly regarded as one of the company’s strongest divisions but, as we progress into the Paramount era, there are more questions than answers over its long-term future.",

    "fullText": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Lamar Wilkerson had 19 points, Nick Dorn added 18 and Conor Enright scored five of his eight points in the final 71 seconds to help Indiana hold off No. 12 Purdue 72-67 on Tuesday night.\n\nIndiana won its second straight game and gave coach Darian DeVries the biggest win of his first season with the Hoosiers (14-7, 5-5 Big Ten). It came in his first matchup against Indiana’s biggest rival and on the same night college football’s new national champions were honored during a pregame ceremony on the same court where coach Curt Cignetti once proclaimed “Purdue sucks.”\n\nThe Hoosiers have beaten ranked Boilermakers teams in four of their last five matchups at home.\n\nTrey Kaufman-Renn led Purdue (17-4, 7-3) with 23 points and Braden Smith added 14 points, five rebounds and five assists. But it wasn’t enough for the Boilermakers to avoid extending their losing streak to a season-worst three games.\n\nAnd once again, Purdue sure didn’t look like itself. Indiana negated the Boilermakers’ perceived advantage in the post, outrebounding them 33-28 while only getting outscored 24-18 in the paint in a game that had all the elements of a rivalry.\n\nIndiana initially took control with a 21-6 spurt to close the first half, turning a 23-21 deficit into a 40-29 lead.\n\nThen the Hoosiers had to withstand a series of second-half punches from Purdue.\n\nWhen the Boilermakers closed to 47-41 on Smith’s pull-up jumper with 15:02 to go, the Hoosiers answered with a 7-2 run. When Smith’s layup made it 65-63 with 1:28 left, Enright responded with a 3-pointer. And when Kaufman-Renn’s layup cut the deficit 68-65 with 28 seconds remaining, Enright made two free throws that helped the Hoosiers close it out.\n\nPurdue visits Maryland on Sunday.\n\nIndiana begins its Los Angeles swing with a trip to UCLA on Saturday.",

    "fullText": "Notre Dame has found itself in quite a predicament after their last few games. Niele Ivey’s team has won just a solitary game against Miami while collapsing against Louisville 79-66, UConn 89-47, and Clemson 65-58, which has understandably shaken the team. Notre Dame will be on the road for their next couple of games, visiting the West Coast. Now, the Fighting Irish’s head coach has noted serious flaws within her team, and she demands some swift changes.\n\nNiele Ivey recently joined host Tony Simeone on the “Voice of the Irish” podcast to share where she feels the team has to upgrade itself.\n\n“I think rebounding is a big part of what we need to focus on. Both teams have great balance. Cal is a little bit more athletic. They have great size, so doing a great job on the boards is something that we’re going to focus on, so that’s one thing. Offensively, I always want to work on getting better, defensively being consistent, but rebounding is going to be a big part,” said Niele Ivey as she feels that’s one aspect where the team can improve.\n\nThe rebounding disparity is striking. In their last two losses, Clemson outrebounded them 40-20, and UConn won the battle on the boards 39-24. Moreover California Golden Bears are tall and physical. Sakima Walker, 6’5″, and Claudia Langarita, 6’4″, can cause problems in the paint if the team isn’t careful, and Ivey is well aware of that.\n\n“Yeah its definitely the individual mindset for sure. But like early in the season, we can do more individual things. Right now, we’re doing more 5 on 5, so scrimmaging more.”Ivey clarified that the focus is shifting from individual drills to team-based scrimmages, emphasizing the collective effort she wants to instill in her players.\n\nNotre Dame might have found itself in a black hole, but that hasn’t affected Hannah Hidalgo’s game the slightest. The Notre Dame guard has come out as the top scorer in their last five games despite her team not being able to capitalize on her hot streak. While some are blaming Ivey, Hidalgo refuses to blame her coach.\n\nIn her last game against Clemson, Hidalgo scored 30 points, nearly half the team’s total. She also had 8 steals, 6 assists, and 4 rebounds to boot, but it all went in vain. So what is going wrong and why the sudden dip in form since January? This was the same team that was holding a 10-2 record in the season, but the following month saw a completely different story.\n\nNiele Ivey’s team is 5-3 since January started, and as such, many are coming down hard on the coach. Hidalgo isn’t buying the accusations and making sure that her team takes accountability for the mistakes made.\n\n“To be clear, it’s nothing that Coach Ivey can do to bring the level of toughness to us. This is an individual thing that everybody has to bring consistently. … It’s up to us….. to bring it out of each other… You wouldn’t look at any other team, and they say, ‘We look to our coach to bring that toughness out of us.’ That’s not a thing,” Hidalgo says.\n\nIt is fairly evident that the team is very dependent on Hannah to take them through by now, and that mentality probably won’t help much when the competition gets tough. Except for Hannah, Cassandre Prosper (15.7 PPG ) and Iyana Moore (10.8 PPG) are the only ones who are hitting double figures, and that can definitely be improved because you can’t overburden anyone with extra pressure.\n\nCoach Niele Ivey has 9 more games remaining and would hope and pray that the underlying complications are fixed as soon as possible. For now, her focus is on the upcoming West Coast swing as the first step in the team’s recovery.\n\nThe post Niele Ivey Points to Lingering Notre Dame Red Flag Ahead of West Coast Swing appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "The LSU Tigers have concluded their football season and while they focus on next year's team, their now former players are focusing on the NFL draft.\n\nAfter an impressive showing in the 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl, former Tigers wideout Chris Hilton Jr. has been a late add to the 2026 Senior Bowl roster, per WAFB's Jacques Doucet.\n\nMany scouts at the Shrine Bowl praised the performance of Hilton. It's no surprise, given that this is an environment built for someone like him to excel. The defense is at a disadvantage and he has speed for days.\n\nThe Zachary product came to Baton Rouge as a highly sought-after recruit. He was the No. 58 overall player in his class, fifth-best wideout and third in Louisiana. His ceiling always felt sky high.\n\nA number of unfortunate injuries and circumstances kept Hilton from really ever getting the opportunity to perform at LSU. He finished his career with 41 catches for 780 yards and six touchdowns. He had a career average of 19 yards per reception.\n\nIf he can stay healthy, he certainly has enough to offer an NFL team for a shot. At the very least, he has the speed for it.\n\nBeing brought over from the Shrine Bowl to the Senior Bowl is a big deal. There were 106 Senior Bowl players drafted last season. That's over 41% of the draft. He will have the chance to compete in two practices before the game and the chance to meet with every single NFL team.\n\nThis would be a fantastic journey to the league if Hilton can continue to impress.",

    "description": "There is the live possibility that all six of the Premier League clubs finish inside the top eight to qualify for the Champions League last 16, with English dominance on the European stage reflective of a shift in attitudes",
    "fullText": "In the buildup to Arsenal’s trip to Inter last week, those at their London Colney training base couldn’t help notice a shift in mood. There was no tension, it was all rather relaxed. A largely second-string team then carried that onto the pitch by breezing through a 3-1 away win against last season’s finalists. Long-time club insiders couldn’t help contrasting to 20 or even 15 years ago.\n\n“No pressure going to the San Siro for a Champions League game – imagine that.”\n\nNeedless to say, it wasn’t like that for the Premier League games either side of that win. And while some of that may be distinctive to Arsenal’s first place and a complex about winning the title, it is actually a common feeling.\n\nLiverpool’s many problems have been much less pronounced in the Champions League, where they can still stamp on Real Madrid or go to a stadium as intimidating as Olympique Marseille’s Velodrome and pick off a win.\n\nManchester City may admittedly have more angst after Bodo-Glimt, but they’d probably have taken a home match against Galatasaray to secure automatic qualification before this began. Newcastle United have meanwhile been much less inconsistent, as Tottenham Hotspur have been a force. Most starkly, Burnley and West Ham United posed more difficult challenges than Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAnd this is where there has been a very definite shift.\n\nOne source relates a common view. “The Premier League is now psychologically and tactically more challenging than the Champions League.”\n\nThe European games are described as much less tense. Crisis clubs now look forward to the refresh of a Champions League week, a total inversion of 30 years ago.\n\nSuch claims will almost sound sacrilegious to anyone who grew up steeped in the competition’s mythology from that time, as this really isn’t what the Champions League is supposed to be about. It’s cast as the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nClubs that properly have qualification in the balance – like Antonio Conte’s Napoli – will obviously feel different, but that points to another major factor.\n\nOne is a long-term structural issue that these pages have discussed so much over the years. The Premier League has so much more collective wealth, as can be seen with how Marseille’s total revenue is lower than that of 14 English clubs, and close to half of Villa’s wage bill. Such forces have created a talent drain from everywhere else. Essentially, any time anyone starts to do anything good – and this is especially true as regards coaching – they are snapped up by an English club.\n\nThe only exception seems to be with the majority of truly elite stars. In what looks like a necessary counterbalance, such players – from Kylian Mbappe to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – are still attracted to the glamour of the European super clubs, who also tend to accommodate their wage structures accordingly. Some Premier League figures feel this is the one remaining area where the English competition is missing out, as if it doesn’t already have enough.\n\nIt is very much a coach’s league, though, as recent articles about the effect of pressing and set pieces on goals have illustrated. Many of the major Champions League clubs don’t have to think about this in the same way, repeatedly leading to the bizarre scenes of Arne Slot declaring his delight that European opposition don’t play in a low block.\n\nThey might have to start thinking about it if English dominance continues – but the wonder is how far that goes.\n\nAs we go into the grand television event that is the final group night – intended to make all of this worthwhile – there is the live possibility that all six of the English clubs qualify as part of the top eight. Arsenal are already all but confirmed as top.\n\nEven if all six don’t qualify, it says enough that it’s a distinctive prospect, to say nothing that six clubs from one country is already too much anyway.\n\nThere are figures at the top of Uefa who readily complain about how the “European space” was made impossible by Bosman and an economic context that ensures a concentration of wealth to an ever-narrowing area of the game, although questions could then be asked about decisions made and regulation.\n\nThis very Champions League model was partly intended to be a regulatory response to all this, but it might well have had the adverse effect.\n\nSo much of the competition feels like the stakes are so low. Even this week, Napoli vs Chelsea is one of the few matches that feels “big”, but it’s not like it’s a straight knockout: Chelsea have the safety net.\n\nIt’s another contrast with the Premier League. For all the bombast of the competition, there is constant noise and narrative around it; with these Champions League matches, many of them feel like filler with little consequence.\n\nBecause, no matter how you try to talk around it, even a Paris Saint-Germain vs Newcastle United that is about automatic qualification won’t feel the same as sudden death.\n\nTake the example of that Spurs vs Dortmund match. Would it have felt quite so forgiving for Spurs if it were a knockout? The energy would have been completely different. Dortmund themselves would surely have looked different, and perhaps prepared a more layered gameplan than something that just felt like it was for a weekly league match.\n\nAnd yet these strange stakes may also work another way.\n\nIt’s been said before, but there is a considerable irony to how the “prize” for the top eight is to avoid an extra two “punishment” fixtures, when the entire point of this expanded Champions League is that the wealthy clubs actively wanted more games. Arsenal badly needed a free midweek, so they played for it.\n\nWhat does that say about the football calendar and its effects?\n\nHence, a mere two English winners in this decade so far, despite all that wealth. Premier League teams get to the business end too exhausted, and after so much more competitive tension in their domestic league, where the European super clubs’ greater stars finally have that space to excel.\n\nLook at the fate of last year’s group winners, Liverpool. Arsenal might have to be conscious of that.\n\nPSG’s victory in the final, meanwhile, only fosters the sense that very little of this matters that much, even allowing for changes that mean knockout home games will be dictated by the table.\n\nWednesday night will, of course, still be fun. Goals will rain in. The table will constantly change, even if that works against any sense of drama, as there’s much to keep up with.\n\nThe Champions League is supposed to be about so much more than that, though. And it’s supposed to be about much more than a handful of clubs.",

    "fullText": "Coco Gauff’s emotional outburst at the AO has reignited a broader debate about player privacy. After her 1-6, 2-6 loss to Elina Svitolina in the QF, footage surfaced of the American smashing her racket in what she believed was a private backstage area. The 21-year-old later expressed disappointment over the moment being broadcast. Now, her fellow tennis star Iga Swiatek has also echoed her concerns, questioning the lack of privacy for players behind the scenes.\n\nSwiatek also made her way out of the competition with a 5-7, 1-6 loss to Elena Rybakina. But during her post-match press conference, she was asked to reflect a bit on the cameras backstage at the tournament. Replying to that, the Pole said, “The question is, are we tennis players? Or are we animals in the zoo? Where they are observed even when they’re pooping. Ok, that was exaggerating obviously, but it would be nice to have some privacy. It would be nice also to have your own process and not always be observed.”\n\nShe stressed the importance of having some space where the players can do private things without the whole world watching. Iga Swiatek gave a few examples of courts and highlighted how, at some tournaments, it’s impossible to avoid people constantly observing them. “I don’t think it should be like that because we are tennis players. We’re meant to be watched on court and in the press. That’s our job. It’s not our job to be a meme when you forget your accreditation. It’s funny for sure. People have something to talk about. For us, I don’t think it’s necessary.”\n\nWhen Swiatek was asked if she had talked to the tournament about it here, she replied, “What’s the point?”\n\nThe post Iga Swiatek Speaks Out on Players’ Privacy After Coco Gauff’s Infamous Racket Break Incident: “Are We Animals” appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "The United Center in Chicago will become the first major U.S. sports venue to offer THC-infused drinks during events, reflecting a growing demand for non-alcoholic alternatives.\n\nThe arena — home to the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks — announced the move on Tuesday in a joint statement with RYTHM, a local beverage company.\n\nThe company inked a multi-year deal with the stadium to sell its drink, called Señorita, which contains hemp-derived THC, to guests 21 and older at live events, including concerts. The beverages, however, will not be available at sporting events due to league regulations.\n\n\"We are excited to introduce Señorita and RYTHM to the live entertainment space,” Joe Myhra, the chief operating officer at United Center, said in the release. “As we continue to evolve offerings for our guests, RYTHM’s Chicago roots made its beverage line a natural fit for the United Center experience.”\n\nSeñorita, which includes five milligrams of THC per drink, will become available for purchase at the stadium beginning in February.\n\n“Bringing Señorita and RYTHM to the United Center reflects a simple truth: consumers want non-alcoholic options, and leading venues are responding,” Ben Kovler, the CEO of RYTHM, said in the release.\n\n“The United Center is one of the world’s premier venues and continues to set the standard for live entertainment with the introduction of these modern, responsible options,” he added.\n\nThe announcement comes as demand for alcoholic beverages has fallen to a record low in the U.S., according to an August Gallup poll. In the survey, 54 percent of Americans reported consuming alcohol, marking the lowest share since 1939. The trend is largely driven by younger adults.\n\nAt the same time, young Americans are increasingly unwinding with weed drinks.\n\nIn an August poll by Drug Rehab USA, 66 percent of Gen Z and Millennial respondents said they had tried alternatives to alcohol in the past six months, with 24 percent saying they had “at least partially” substituted alcohol with non-alcoholic or cannabis-infused drinks.",

    "description": "Early on in the 25/26 season, when the Los Angeles Lakers were flying high, Austin Reaves was one of their best players. Of course, he was playing a supporting role to Luka Doncic, but it was key, and something they’re missing in their current rollercoaster stretch.",
    "fullText": "Early on in the 25/26 season, when the Los Angeles Lakers were flying high, Austin Reaves was one of their best players. Of course, he was playing a supporting role to Luka Doncic, but it was key, and something they’re missing in their current rollercoaster stretch.\n\nFor now, Reaves remains out with the calf strain he sustained in December and will miss the Lakers’ next game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, at the very least. However, he is not too far from returning, and could very well arrive in time for the most crucial part of the season.\n\nDanny Green, for one, feels that Reaves’ performances in the postseason will actually determine how far the Lakers can go. One thing is for certain, though. Reaves has to do much better than he did in previous seasons.\n\nOn ESPN, the topic of discussion was: which player is most important to the Lakers this season, and Green’s answer was Reaves and how he performs in the playoffs. “Of course, in the playoffs, we’ve seen his numbers have taken a dip,” he began.\n\nLast season, Reaves averaged 21 points per game in the regular season, but his numbers dipped to 16 in the playoffs. This season, his regular-season scoring has jumped to 26 points per game so far. It is a significant leap, and one that will need to carry over into the playoffs as well.\n\nGreen feels that not much will change on the defensive front for the Lakers, even if they sign a 3 and D-wing. So, their best chance to beat teams is to outscore them.\n\n“They’re gonna need these guys to score a bunch, obviously. Luke is proven, Bron is proven in the playoffs, Austin Reaves is the guy they’re kind of seeing if he’s gonna grow and take that next step to being that third scorer consistently, night in and night out,” Green added. “So, they’re gonna need him.”\n\nThe Lakers looked genuinely comfortable with Reaves and Doncic running the offense, but they slipped into a slump once Reaves was injured and LeBron was forced into a secondary scoring role. That is something that has to change in the coming weeks, even if it means James taking a step back to allow Reaves to thrive.\n\nCurrently, the Lakers are 28-17 and fifth in the Western Conference.\n\nThe post “They’re Gonna Need Him”: Austin Reaves’ Playoff Leap Will Determine Lakers’ Ceiling, Says Danny Green appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "title": "Why the Champions League has become so significant for Arne Slot’s Liverpool",
    "description": "Slot struggled to explain Liverpool’s poor league form but a strong end to the season will take the spotlight off the beleaguered manager",
    "fullText": "Liverpool have only lost once in their last 14 games. They sit fourth in the Champions League table, level on points with Real Madrid, above Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona. Their last two European nights have brought away wins over Inter and Marseille.\n\nIt is not the whole picture, though; it cannot be, when they are sixth in the Premier League, 14 points off the pace. A long unbeaten run came to an end at Bournemouth on Saturday. It brought a chorus of criticism: the “outside noise”, as Arne Slot called it. Much of it is concentrated around him. A title-winning manager may have lost the backing of some Liverpool supporters; it can seem so at such times. And if part of the issue is that too many of those 13 undefeated matches were actually draws that produced frustration, Slot is aware that if victories bring respite, setbacks prompt another outcry. Which, in itself, is revealing. The soundtrack can reflect a dissatisfaction with him.\n\n“I think it's going to be really difficult to quiet the outside noise with the position we are in in the league so even if we win a few games, every loss or every disappointing result will start the noise coming back again,” he said. “That's what you can expect if you started the season as we did; not started, but at a certain moment with so many losses. So it's impossible to shut down the noise at a club like this if you are not competing for the league.”\n\nWhich Liverpool are not. Slot pointed out that Liverpool have only won it twice in three decades; as is his wont, he tried to offset talk of their £450m spending last summer by saying they brought in £300m. Yet others of his numbers stood up to less scrutiny.\n\nHe argued Liverpool are suffering from competing on multiple fronts and turned his attention to last season’s Champions League. “This is not going to be a popular opinion but I am going to tell you: maybe the reason why we won the league last season is that we had to play Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16,” he said. “Because as you know they beat us and [then] we had every time a week to prepare for our game.”\n\nYet when PSG eliminated Liverpool, they were 15 points clear in the Premier League, with only nine games to go; it would have taken an almighty collapse to stop them from becoming champions.\n\nBut it can represent part of a picture of a manager grasping for explanations. If the league table never lies, one suggests Liverpool are the fourth best team in Europe, the other that they are only the sixth finest in England. Slot suggested one is the consequence of the other. “I think the biggest struggle we have is that we have to play in both leagues, which is what we want, by the way,” he said. “But too many times after a Champions League game we’ve lost. A lot of away games included.” Indeed, Liverpool have four defeats on the weekends after European fixtures, each on the road.\n\nSlot felt exhaustion caught up with them in the final minutes at Bournemouth. They can seem permanently stretched, their expensive revamp leaving them with a squad that was too small and then further reduced by injuries. “It's almost constantly the same players that have to play,” said Slot, who is down to one available centre-back for Wednesday’s game with Qarabag, in captain Virgil van Dijk. Win that, and at least Liverpool have two midweeks off in February and an immediate passage to the last 16.\n\nThe stakes for the remainder of their season are considerable. Champions League qualification has a huge financial importance; there is also the question if Slot regains the faith of the more angry among the fanbase and retains it of the quiet figures in the boardroom.\n\nAll of which could depend on whether Liverpool find a formula. “I think in between the boxes. we are a very, very, very, very good team,” said Slot. “But there is a complete disbalance in how many times we arrive in promising positions and how many times other teams arrive there. But there is not a disbalance in the goals that are scored and that's a very bad cocktail. If we can only improve in one box, then it's going to be probably an acceptable season, but not more than that. And if we can't improve in both boxes, it's going to be a lot of noise throughout the whole season.”\n\nBut what constitutes acceptable? Five months ago, it might have involved retaining the title, or at least coming close. Now that is impossible; so, too, a Carabao Cup run. The Champions League and FA Cup offer the only chances of silverware. Sixth in the Premier League seems unacceptable.\n\n“I have my opinion about what is acceptable, but I am not going to share that,” said Slot. The outside noise, however, will reveal the wider world’s view. The inside noise in the corridors of power may be quieter but more significant.",

    "fullText": "The South Bay Lakers continued an extended homestand on Tuesday when they hosted the College Park Skyhawks. They came in with a 6-6 record and looked to go over .500 after losing five of their six previous games.\n\nThey fell behind 35-24 at the end of the first quarter and looked to be in trouble. They still trailed 68-60 at halftime, but afterward, South Bay clamped down defensively and held the Skyhawks to just 39 second-half points, allowing it to come away with a 121-107 victory.\n\nOverall, it held the Skyhawks to 39.6% shooting from the field and 28.9% from 3-point range, and it forced 19 turnovers while scoring 29 points off those miscues. Seven of its players scored in double figures, and it had a robust total of 28 assists.\n\nThe Lakers' starting backcourt of R.J. Davis and Kobe Bufkin shot a combined 11-of-32 from the field, but they combined for 11 assists against just three turnovers.

    "description": "Three days after a lopsided loss against another ranked opponent, the Utes put forth a much better effort against the Mountaineers.",
    "fullText": "The Utah women’s basketball team was determined to make up for a humbling, lopsided loss last Saturday against Texas Tech.\n\nNo. 22 West Virginia just so happened to be the team standing between the Utes and a get-right game, as Utah beat the Mountaineers 71-64 Tuesday night at the Huntsman Center.\n\n“This one was kind of personal. I think a lot of us had a bad taste in our mouth. ... It’s not that we brush that loss under the rug or anything, we learn from it, most importantly,” Utah junior forward Reese Ross said.\n\n“It’s so huge that we’re able to get another opportunity just within 48 hours. Being able to adjust, it shows growth and determination, trust, and all these things that are going to carry into postseason.”\n\nThe Utes (15-6, 6-3 Big 12) started slow offensively, but unlike the loss to the Red Raiders, they relied on their defense to help them build confidence in a difficult matchup.\n\nWest Virginia (17-5, 7-3 Big 12) shot 41.3% in the game, but only 33.3% in the first quarter, and that helped Utah, which gave up 77 points to the Red Raiders three days earlier, lead from the get-go against the Mountaineers.\n\nOnce the Utes’ offense kicked into high gear, it was Utah’s night to shine.\n\nThe Utes shot 54% from the field, including 10 of 18 from 3-point range.\n\nThe Mountaineers, meanwhile, hit just 2 of 12 3s, the primary difference in a game where Utah led by as many as 18 points in the third quarter, then fended off a rally from West Virginia in the fourth.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the Utes’ ability to hit 3s that helped turned the tide in their favor — oftentimes, those outside shots came at critical moments.\n\nThe Mountaineers used a 7-0 run to start the fourth quarter to make it a 55-49 game, but Ross responded with a 3, then after a Utah free throw from Brooke Walker, LA Sneed added a triple of her own. Like that, the double-digit lead was restored.\n\nWest Virginia cut it to five in the final minute, but again, the Utes had an answer.\n\n“(I’m) just extremely proud of our players, our coaching staff, for turning the page after a not-so-great performance on Saturday, and just getting back to Utah basketball — being connected, playing with intensity, locked in focus, and just competing,\" Utah coach Gavin Petersen said.\n\n“Just really proud of our players for putting that game aside. That’s hard to do, especially when you lose at home, but we bounced back and so extremely proud. That’s a really good team, West Virginia.”\n\nOn the opposite bench, Mountaineers coach Mark Kellogg, who saw his team score 91 points in a win over BYU in Provo last Saturday, said his team struggled to match the Utes’ intensity.\n\n“They punched us early. Stayed with that the basically the entire night. We made a couple little runs there in the second half, but that first half was not very good from our standards,” he said.\n\n“We knew they would come in disappointed after their last game. Wanted to make sure we kind of match that intensity. We did not.”\n\nOne of those players who set that tone was Sneed, the true freshman.\n\nShe scored in double-digits for the fourth time this season, leading Utah with 15 points, just two off her career high. Sneed made 5 of 6 from the field, 3 of 4 from 3 and added three assists in a game that showcased the kind of confidence she is finding midway through her first college season.\n\n“I feel like I just wasn’t hesitating anymore, just letting the ball fly, and obviously it went in,” Sneed said. “But also, my teammates just relay confidence in me. And I think just seeing our our offense flow and our defense flow and the flow of the game, I just went in and did what I needed to do.”\n\nRoss, meanwhile, added her fourth double-double of the season with 12 points and 10 rebounds, setting the physical tone that Utah needed against one of the toughest remaining opponents on Utah’s regular-season schedule. She also had a team-high four assists.\n\nChrya Evans (12 points, three rebounds, three assists) and Lani White (14 points, three rebounds) also played critical roles in helping Utah earn its second win over a ranked opponent this season.\n\nJordan Harrison led the Mountaineers with 18 points, eight assists and seven rebounds.\n\nOn this night, though, it was a balanced Utah effort — and responding well from a soul-searching loss a few nights earlier — that powered the Utes to victory.\n\nPetersen praised his team for their ability to shake off the previous game and its offensive woes that night — when Utah shot just 32.7% — and show that those struggles wouldn’t carry over.\n\n“You got to have some courage. You’re going to make it or miss it, right? It’s a 50/50, chance,” the coach said. “You got to have the courage to be able to miss those shots, and when you get beyond like, is it a good shot, then shoot it.\n\n“I think our younger kids are starting to figure that out. It’s more about the shot quality, because over time and how we train, more often than not we believe it’s going to go in.”",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Williams scored 27 points, Dillon Brooks had 26 and the short-handed Suns beat the Brooklyn Nets 106-102 on Tuesday night in a game that featured a scuffle late in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter Brooks put the Suns ahead 104-102 on two free throws with 1:23 remaining, a steal by the Suns’ Royce O’Neale led to a scramble for the ball in the paint. Brooks tried to wrestle the ball away from Ziaire Williams after the whistle, and the Nets’ Egor Demin pushed Brooks.\n\nSeveral players started jawing at each other and assistant coaches from both sides gathered on the floor as officials tried to restore order. Demin, Mann and Michael Porter Jr. received technical fouls for the Nets, and the Suns’ Grayson Allen and O’Neale also got technicals. Brooks did not receive a technical after getting one earlier in the game.\n\nAllen added 18 points for the short-handed Suns, who ended a two-game skid. Devin Booker missed his second straight game after rolling his right ankle in a loss at Atlanta on Friday night, and Jalen Green also sat with a nagging right hamstring injury.\n\nPorter finished with a season-high 36 points for the Nets, who have lost six straight and 14 of 16. Demin added 15 points, but Brooklyn struggled to find secondary scoring.\n\nWhen Porter made a 3-pointer with 9:47 left in the third quarter, he had 12 of the Nets’ 24 baskets for 27 points.\n\nPhoenix led 91-81 midway through the fourth, but Brooklyn responded with a 19-5 run capped by Porter’s 3 for a 100-96 lead with 3:33 left. Williams scored four quick points for Phoenix and then Allen tied it at 102-all with 1:39 remaining.\n\nNets: At Denver on Thursday night.\n\nSuns: Host Detroit on Thursday night.",

    "description": "High school boys basketball: Highland runs away from Olympus in 5A showdown of top 3 teams",
    "fullText": "Highland coach Chris Jones said he believes when teams arrive at Olympus for a boys basketball game, most of the time they’ve already lost before stepping on the floor.\n\n“I mean, 99% of the teams that get off the bus don’t think they can come in here and win,” said Jones. “So I’ve been preaching, preaching, preaching for three years, you got to think you can beat them. And if you think you can beat them, then you got a half a chance.”\n\nFortunately for Jones, not only do his Highland players think they can beat Olympus, they know they can.\n\nHighland beat Olympus 64-58 on Tuesday night in relatively dominant fashion, its second straight win on the Titans’ home floor after winning 50-47 a year ago.\n\nThe Rams led by as many as 19 points early in the fourth quarter and then held off a furious rally by the Titans to secure the region split after Olympus won the first meeting back in December 77-72.\n\n“It got a bit sweaty there,” said Jones about the fourth quarter.\n\nThe teams, who were ranked No. 2 and 3 in 5A coming into Tuesday’s game, have now split the season series in three straight years.\n\nIf they meet in the playoffs for a third straight time next month, Jones hopes Tuesday’s performance strengthens his team’s belief that it can beat Olympus in the postseason too.\n\n“They kicked our butts in the state tournament when it matters (two straight year). But you know, hopefully we get a chance to play them again,” said Jones.\n\nHighland never trailed on Tuesday as it shot 47% from the field led by Jordan Oberholtzer’s 20 points and Grady Lee’s 17. Bodie Dodge added 15 points as the Rams improved to 16-2 on the season while the Titans dropped to 16-2 as well.\n\n“I’m just so happy for Highland and the community. They’ve bought in so much the last four or five years what we’re trying to do,” said Jones. “Olympus is the crème de la crème. They’re the best there is. They’ve been the best for 10 years. And so just a chance to be able to compete with them and play with them and give them a game—not many people give them a game.”\n\nHighland led by 13-7 at the end of the first quarter, 26-17 at the half and then 43-31 heading into the fourth.\n\nJones admits his team was a bit fortunate that Olympus leading scorer Gavin Lowe — who averages 25 points — missed all seven of his shots in the first half and went scoreless. But at the same time, he said it was the result of a much tougher defensive performance than the first time around when Olympus had five players score in double figures.\n\n“They have Gavin, who is elite, elite, elite, but they’re also big. And they got a bunch of guys that are big, and we got a bunch of guards. So our thought was, we got to pressure them. We can’t let those big guys just stand around and pass and throw high-low on us because last game they killed us on high-low because we were soft,” said Jones.\n\nThat wasn’t the case in the rematch as Highland was elite definitely in the first three quarters holding Olympus to 36 percent shooting and just 3-of-16 from 3-point range.\n\nDown nine at halftime, the Titans came out and tried to press their way back into the game, but the Rams — who Jones jokes are a team with four point guards and a big — handle it well and extended the lead to double digits heading into the fourth.\n\n“We did a great job against their press. I mean, they got a couple, but we scored plenty on their press. And we just wanted to get up and down the court and play with them,” said Jones.\n\nHighland opened the fourth on a 9-2 run as Oberholtzer and Isaiah Drisdom drained 3s, and Oberholtzer converted a 3-point play after a difficult finish at the rim.\n\nFor Olympus, trailing 52-33 with 5:25 remaining was the final wake-up call, and it finally started hitting shots — particularly 3-pointers.\n\nLowe and Caden Jackson both made a pair of 3s over the next five minutes, while Adam Bywater made another as Olympus whittled the lead all the way to 63-58 with 15 seconds left in the game.\n\nThe Titans forced a turnover on the ensuing inbounds pass and got a good look at 3-pointer that could’ve made it a one-possession game with 12 seconds left, but the shot rattled out and Highland corralled the rebound to finish off the win.\n\nLowe finished with 18 points in the loss as he scored all of his points in the second half. Jackson added 13.",

    "fullText": "Sky Germany have ruled out any active Bayern involvement in one current transfer deal and say Chelsea are still pushing to sign the player.\n\nWe are just days away from another transfer window closing out at the weekend, and clubs are scrambling around to get some final deals done this winter.\n\nChelsea have not really done anything at all yet this window other than a teenage left back from Sheffield Wednesday into their academy. But players sales, nothing, new player arrivals, nothing. There’s time left, and maybe this means the club will be pretty active on transfer deadline day!\n\nA lot can still happen, and it looks like even the Jeremy Jacquet situation could still spark up. Chelsea have been trying to sign the centre back from Rennes this window, but have so far not managed to.\n\nJeremy Jacquet playing for Rennes. (Photo by Chris Lee/Chelsea FC)\n\nSky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg posted on X last night and said:\n\n‘Bayern are currently not in negotiations with Jeremy #Jacquet’s management or Stade Rennes over an early transfer in the summer.\n\n“Bayern are monitoring the situation and remain interested for the summer, but nothing more at this stage. The focus is on extending Dayot Upamecano’s contract. Other (optional) centre-backs under contract: Tah, Kim, Ito, Stanisic.\n\n“Chelsea are not giving up. They are pushing hard to find a solution before Deadline Day.”\n\nLiam Rosenior has he pre-match press conference last night for the Napoli game tonight, and he confirmed that he is due to have some talks with a Chelsea defender who was recalled from his loan spell later this week.\n\nHe also said that Moises Caicedo plays like a 35-year-old which is actually a back-handed compliment for the midfielder!",

    "fullText": "Tuesday night in the NBA delivered drama, big performances, and tight finishes. Several teams snapped losing streaks, while others struggled to close games. Young stars made noise and veterans stepped up when needed. From last-second free throws to fourth-quarter takeovers, the night had a bit of everything. Here is a breakdown of the winners and losers from all the games.\n\nWashington finally snapped its nine-game losing streak with a tough home win. Alex Sarr led the way with 29 points, 12 rebounds, and six blocks, staying aggressive all night. Kyshawn George and Bub Carrington made big plays late, while Khris Middleton calmly iced the game at the line. Even after getting crushed on the boards, the Wizards found timely buckets and ended a home losing run against Portland that stretched back to 2017.\n\nPortland dominated the glass but couldn’t finish the job. Shaedon Sharpe scored 31 points, and Donovan Clingan added 14 points and 20 rebounds. Deni Avdija had a solid return with 17 points and 12 boards. Missed free throws and another late collapse cost them a winnable game.\n\nNew York owned the fourth quarter by outscoring Sacramento 31-15. Jalen Brunson led the charge with 28 points and took control late. Karl-Anthony Towns added 17 points and 11 rebounds. Mikal Bridges chipped in with 18 points and OG Anunoby had 15. The Knicks forced the pace and turned defense into offense. Mike Brown also earned his first win against Sacramento since leaving the team. Even with 21 turnovers, New York stayed composed when it mattered most.\n\nSacramento lost its sixth straight game and struggled badly from deep. The team shot just 5 of 30 from three-point range. DeMar DeRozan scored 34 points but had little help. Russell Westbrook added 14 points but could not spark a rally. Their offense went cold in the fourth quarter and they could not keep up with New York’s run. Poor shooting and weak defense in the final period sealed their fate.\n\nPhiladelphia bounced back after a blowout loss the night before. Paul George scored 32 points and hit nine three-pointers. Joel Embiid had 29 points and scored 18 in the first quarter alone. Tyrese Maxey added 22 points and kept the offense moving. The Sixers played with fresh energy after both stars returned from rest. Their shooting and ball movement overwhelmed Milwaukee. The win also showed how different this team looks with its main players healthy.\n\nMilwaukee played without Giannis Antetokounmpo and felt his absence. Myles Turner scored 31 points and Ryan Rollins added 24, but defense was the issue. The Bucks allowed too many open looks from three. Bobby Portis and Kyle Kuzma each had 17 points but could not stop the Sixers’ runs. Injuries continued to hurt their rhythm and depth.\n\nOklahoma City avoided a third straight loss despite missing several key players. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 29 points and stayed perfect at the line. Chet Holmgren delivered 20 points, 14 rebounds, and five blocks. Isaiah Joe added 17 points off the bench. The Thunder stayed steady during a late Pelicans push. Strong defense and patience helped them close the game.\n\nNew Orleans could not finish its comeback after cutting the lead to five. Zion Williamson had 21 points and 11 rebounds on efficient shooting. Saddiq Bey added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Tempers flared late and the flow of the game slipped away from them. Missed chances in the final minutes cost them a third-quarter rally.\n\nDetroit continued its strong run and held off a late Denver charge. Tobias Harris scored 22 points and hit two clutch free throws. Cade Cunningham finished with 22 points and 11 assists. The Pistons built an early lead and survived missed shots down the stretch. Their balance and poise showed again in a tight finish.\n\nDenver struggled with travel issues and missing players. Jamal Murray had 24 points and 10 assists but missed key free throws late. Jonas Valanciunas posted 16 points and 16 rebounds in his return. Fatigue and injuries hurt their execution. The rally fell short after several missed chances.\n\nPhoenix won despite missing key scorers. Mark Williams had 27 points and Dillon Brooks added 26. Grayson Allen chipped in with 18 points. The Suns survived a late Nets run and closed the game with defense and free throws. Even after a scuffle broke out, they stayed focused and finished strong.\n\nBrooklyn lost its sixth straight game. Michael Porter Jr. scored a season-high 36 points but got little support. Egor Demin added 15 points. The Nets could not hold a late lead and struggled with second scoring options. Emotions ran high and technical fouls did not help their cause.\n\nThe Clippers erased an early deficit with a huge second and third quarter. Kawhi Leonard led the comeback and stayed steady late. Kris Dunn sparked a big third-quarter surge with defense and playmaking. Los Angeles outscored Utah 36-20 in the third and never looked back. The win moved them closer to a .500 record.\n\nUtah started fast but faded after halftime. Lauri Markkanen led early but struggled later. The Jazz could not handle the Clippers’ pressure defense. Scoring dried up in the second half and the lead slipped away quickly. Another loss showed their trouble finishing games.\n\nJanuary 27 brought strong wins for teams like Washington, New York, and Philadelphia. Young stars like Alex Sarr and Chet Holmgren made a clear impact. Veteran leaders such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George also delivered when needed. On the losing side, missed free throws and cold shooting proved costly for several teams. The night showed how small moments can decide close NBA games.\n\nThe post NBA results: January 27, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "'Thiccer Kicker' Harrison Mevis caps stellar season in Los Angeles originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile the Los Angeles Rams enjoyed a successful season that ended one win shy of the Super Bowl, they also quietly turned their kicking situation into a feel-good story.\n\nHarrison Mevis, affectionately known as “The Thiccer Kicker,” finished a standout year in Los Angeles, one that was fueled as much by patience and preparation as performance.\n\nMevis was cut by the Jets before the regular season but continued to prepare each week as if he would be lining up kicks on an NFL field every Sunday. That approach paid off. He converted 18 of 19 field-goal attempts, including the playoffs, and was perfect on all 48 extra points.\n\nMORE: Rams predicted to nab star NFC South cornerback in free agency\n\nThe opportunity — and the results — meant “everything” to him.“I think you, you kind of saw the results there,” Mevis said, according to therams.com. “It works. It's a lot like golf and you kinda keep it simple and you'll make kicks. Don't overcomplicate it.”\n\nMevis credited punter and holder Ethan Evans, long snapper Jake McQuaide, and the protection unit for helping make his season possible. Before landing with the Rams, Mevis spent time with the Jets, Panthers, and the UFL’s Birmingham Stallions.\n\nMORE: Bills head coach hire of Joe Brady is great news for Broncos, Rams, Titans\n\nFresh off the conclusion of the season, Mevis said he hasn’t yet given much thought to his long-term future with the Rams or in the league. What he does know is that he’ll be “ready to make the next kick, whenever that comes,” just as he was when Los Angeles called.\n\nRams predicted to make aggressive NFL Draft decision amid Matthew Stafford uncertainty\n\nESPN analyst reveals how Rams could use their two first-round picks in 2026 NFL Draft\n\nRams free agent update on Kamren Curl is bad news thanks to $42 million signing\n\nRams expected to get answer on Matthew Stafford's future early in offseason",

    "fullText": "Every friend I have with a job that involves picking up something heavier than a laptop more than twice a week eventually finds a way to slip something like this into conversation: “Bro,1[1] you don’t work hard. I just worked a 4700-hour week digging a tunnel under Mordor with a screwdriver.”\n\nThey have a point. Mordor sucks, and it’s certainly more physically taxing to dig a tunnel than poke at a keyboard unless you’re an ant. But, for the sake of the argument, can we agree that stress and insanity are bad things? Awesome. Welcome to programming.\n\nImagine joining an engineering team. You’re excited and full of ideas, probably just out of school and a world of clean, beautiful designs, awe-inspiring in their aesthetic unity of purpose, economy, and strength. You start by meeting Mary, project leader for a bridge in a major metropolitan area. Mary introduces you to Fred, after you get through the fifteen security checks installed by Dave because Dave had his sweater stolen off his desk once and Never Again. Fred only works with wood, so you ask why he’s involved because this bridge is supposed to allow rush-hour traffic full of cars full of mortal humans to cross a 200-foot drop over rapids. Don’t worry, says Mary, Fred’s going to handle the walkways. What walkways? Well Fred made a good case for walkways and they’re going to add to the bridge’s appeal. Of course, they’ll have to be built without railings, because there’s a strict no railings rule enforced by Phil, who’s not an engineer. Nobody’s sure what Phil does, but it’s definitely full of synergy and has to do with upper management, whom none of the engineers want to deal with so they just let Phil do what he wants. Sara, meanwhile, has found several hemorrhaging-edge paving techniques, and worked them all into the bridge design, so you’ll have to build around each one as the bridge progresses, since each one means different underlying support and safety concerns. Tom and Harry have been working together for years, but have an ongoing feud over whether to use metric or imperial measurements, and it’s become a case of “whoever got to that part of the design first.” This has been such a headache for the people actually screwing things together, they’ve given up and just forced, hammered, or welded their way through the day with whatever parts were handy. Also, the bridge was designed as a suspension bridge, but nobody actually knew how to build a suspension bridge, so they got halfway through it and then just added extra support columns to keep the thing standing, but they left the suspension cables because they’re still sort of holding up parts of the bridge. Nobody knows which parts, but everybody’s pretty sure they’re important parts. After the introductions are made, you are invited to come up with some new ideas, but you don’t have any because you’re a propulsion engineer and don’t know anything about bridges.\n\nWould you drive across this bridge? No. If it somehow got built, everybody involved would be executed. Yet some version of this dynamic wrote every single program you have ever used, banking software, websites, and a ubiquitously used program that was supposed to protect information on the internet but didn’t.\n\nEvery programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.\n\nThis file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.\n\nEvery programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this. Then they’re told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by Tuesday, so they cheat a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes and try to stick them together or they have to ask a coworker to work on one who melts it and then all the programmers’ snowflakes get dumped together in some inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see the cat urine soaking into all your broken snowflakes melting in the light of day. Next week, everybody shovels more snow on it to keep the Picasso from falling over.\n\nThere’s a theory that you can cure this by following standards, except there are more “standards” than there are things computers can actually do, and these standards are all variously improved and maligned by the personal preferences of the people coding them, so no collection of code has ever made it into the real world without doing a few dozen identical things a few dozen not even remotely similar ways. The first few weeks of any job are just figuring out how a program works even if you’re familiar with every single language, framework, and standard that’s involved, because standards are unicorns.\n\nI spent a few years growing up with a closet in my bedroom. The closet had an odd design. It looked normal at first, then you walked in to do closet things, and discovered that the wall on your right gave way to an alcove, making for a handy little shelf. Then you looked up, and the wall at the back of the alcove gave way again, into a crawlspace of utter nothingness, where no light could fall and which you immediately identified as the daytime retreat for every ravenous monster you kept at bay with flashlights and stuffed animals each night.\n\nThis is what it is to learn programming. You get to know your useful tools, then you look around, and there are some handy new tools nearby and those tools show you the bottomless horror that was always right next to your bed.\n\nFor example, say you’re an average web developer. You’re familiar with a dozen programming languages, tons of helpful libraries, standards, protocols, what have you. You still have to learn more at the rate of about one a week, and remember to check the hundreds of things you know to see if they’ve been updated or broken and make sure they all still work together and that nobody fixed the bug in one of them that you exploited to do something you thought was really clever one weekend when you were drunk. You’re all up to date, so that’s cool, then everything breaks.\n\n“Double you tee eff?” you say, and start hunting for the problem. You discover that one day, some idiot decided that since another idiot decided that 1/0 should equal infinity, they could just use that as a shorthand for “Infinity” when simplifying their code. Then a non-idiot rightly decided that this was idiotic, which is what the original idiot should have decided, but since he didn’t, the non-idiot decided to be a dick and make this a failing error in his new compiler. Then he decided he wasn’t going to tell anyone that this was an error, because he’s a dick, and now all your snowflakes are urine and you can’t even find the cat.\n\nYou are an expert in all these technologies, and that’s a good thing, because that expertise let you spend only six hours figuring out what went wrong, as opposed to losing your job. You now have one extra little fact to tuck away in the millions of little facts you have to memorize because so many of the programs you depend on are written by dicks and idiots.\n\nAnd that’s just in your own chosen field, which represents such a tiny fraction of all the things there are to know in computer science you might as well never have learned anything at all. Not a single living person knows how everything in your five-year-old MacBook actually works. Why do we tell you to turn it off and on again? Because we don’t have the slightest clue what’s wrong with it, and it’s really easy to induce coma in computers and have their built-in team of automatic doctors try to figure it out for us. The only reason coders’ computers work better than non-coders’ computers is coders know computers are schizophrenic little children with auto-immune diseases and we don’t beat them when they’re bad.\n\nRemember that stuff about crazy people and bad code? The internet is that except it’s literally a billion times worse. Websites that are glorified shopping carts with maybe three dynamic pages are maintained by teams of people around the clock, because the truth is everything is breaking all the time, everywhere, for everyone. Right now someone who works for Facebook is getting tens of thousands of error messages and frantically trying to find the problem before the whole charade collapses. There’s a team at a Google office that hasn’t slept in three days. Somewhere there’s a database programmer surrounded by empty Mountain Dew bottles whose husband thinks she’s dead. And if these people stop, the world burns. Most people don’t even know what sysadmins do, but trust me, if they all took a lunch break at the same time they wouldn’t make it to the deli before you ran out of bullets protecting your canned goods from roving bands of mutants.\n\nYou can’t restart the internet. Trillions of dollars depend on a rickety cobweb of unofficial agreements and “good enough for now” code with comments like “TODO: FIX THIS IT’S A REALLY DANGEROUS HACK BUT I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S WRONG” that were written ten years ago. I haven’t even mentioned the legions of people attacking various parts of the internet for espionage and profit or because they’re bored. Ever heard of 4chan? 4chan might destroy your life and business because they decided they didn’t like you for an afternoon, and we don’t even worry about 4chan because another nuke doesn’t make that much difference in a nuclear winter.\n\nOn the internet, it’s okay to say, “You know, this kind of works some of the time if you’re using the right technology,” and BAM! it’s part of the internet now. Anybody with a couple of hundred dollars and a computer can snag a little bit of the internet and put up whatever awful chunks of hack code they want and then attach their little bit to a bunch of big bits and everything gets a little bit worse. Even the good coders don’t bother to learn the arcane specifications outlined by the organizations people set up to implement some unicorns, so everybody spends half their time coping with the fact that nothing matches anything or makes any sense and might break at any time and we just try to cover it up and hope no one notices.\n\nHere are the secret rules of the internet: five minutes after you open a web browser for the first time, a kid in Russia has your social security number. Did you A computer at the NSA now automatically tracks your physical location for the rest of your life. Sent an email? Your email address just went up on a billboard in Nigeria.\n\nThese things aren’t true because we don’t care and don’t try to stop them, they’re true because everything is broken because there’s no good code and everybody’s just trying to keep it running. That’s your job if you work with the internet: hoping the last thing you wrote is good enough to survive for a few hours so you can eat dinner and catch a nap.\n\nFunny, right? No? How about this exchange:\n\nWasn’t that guy helpful? With the camel? Doesn’t that seem like an appropriate response? No? Good. You can still find Jesus. You have not yet spent so much of your life reading code that you begin to talk in it. The human brain isn’t particularly good at basic logic and now there’s a whole career in doing nothing but really, really complex logic. Vast chains of abstract conditions and requirements have to be picked through to discover things like missing commas. Doing this all day leaves you in a state of mild aphasia as you look at people’s faces while they’re speaking and you don’t know they’ve finished because there’s no semicolon. You immerse yourself in a world of total meaninglessness where all that matters is a little series of numbers went into a giant labyrinth of symbols and a different series of numbers or a picture of a kitten came out the other end.\n\nThe destructive impact on the brain is demonstrated by the programming languages people write. This is a program:\n\nThat program does exactly the same thing as this program:\n\nAnd once somebody wrote a programming language that let somebody else write this:\n\nAccording to the author, that program is \"two lines of code that parse two lines of embedded comments in the code to read the Mayan numbers representing the individual ASCII characters that make up the magazine title, rendered in 90-degree rotated ASCII art.\"\n\nThat program won a contest, because of course it did. Do you want to live in a world like this? No. This is a world where you can smoke a pack a day and nobody even questions it. \"Of course he smokes a pack a day, who wouldn't?\" Eventually every programmer wakes up and before they're fully conscious they see their whole world and every relationship in it as chunks of code, and they trade stories about it as if sleepiness triggering acid trips is a normal thing that happens to people. This is a world where people eschew sex to write a programming language for orangutans. All programmers are forcing their brains to do things brains were never meant to do in a situation they can never make better, ten to fifteen hours a day, five to seven days a week, and every one of them is slowly going mad.\n\nSo no, I’m not required to be able to lift objects weighing up to fifty pounds. I traded that for the opportunity to trim Satan’s pubic hair while he dines out of my open skull so a few bits of the internet will continue to work for a few more days.\n\n(Update: now available in Greek, Czech, Italian, Russian, Portuguese, Hungarian, French, Hebrew (PDF by Ilil Hoz), German (PDF by Kurt Frock), Spanish, and Chinese)",

    "fullText": "I got nerd-sniped right before work and just had to write this post.\n\nIn AI code and software craft, Alex looks at AI through the lens of Jacques Ellul’s “technique.”\n\nJacques Ellul describes his concept of “technique” as the reduction of activity to a set of efficient means to a measured and defined end — a way of thinking dominant in modernity.\n\nHe argues that an arts and crafts style movement that focuses on craftsmanship can stave off the totality of technique. I’m all for arts and crafts, but that view is at odds with Ellul’s view. Ellul believed that technique was “inevitable” and all-consuming and unstoppable, like the smoke monster in Lost.\n\nAndrew Feenberg’s viewpoint is actually \n\nFor example, the “technique” of the 19th-century factory was brutal efficiency. But through unions and laws (human agency), we forced the technique to adapt to child labor laws and safety standards. Efficiency was curbed by social values.\n\nFeenberg showed us a few ways to push back against Technique.\n\nDonald Knuth, a renowned computer scientist, invented literate programming, which redefined the way we write code – by putting us humans first. In literate programming you start with prose and interject code, rather than writing code and sprinkling in comments. He inverted the existing model from speed of implementation to ease of understanding.\n\nSimilarly, Feenberg would redefine AI by building AI tools that optimize for maintainability, readability, and beauty.\n\nIn the 1980s, the French government distributed the Minitel (a proto-internet terminal) to millions of homes. The technique goal was bureaucratic efficiency: to modernize the phone directory and deliver government information. It was cold, rational, and top-down.\n\nInstead, users hacked the system. They ignored the government directories and turned the network into a massive, chaotic instant-messaging service. They used the machine for flirting, arguing, and socializing. The users subverted the rational design. They took a tool of control and turned it into a tool of communication.\n\nIn other words, don’t just boycott AI. Misuse it.\n\nFeenberg distinguishes between two layers of technology. To overcome technique, we have to re-integrate them. The primary instrumentalization is the raw technical aspect. For code that means purely technical, decontextualized logic. The second instrumentalization is social, aesthetic, and ethical context. The code is elegant and respects the user’s privacy. To unify the two, we must demand that the second instrumentalization be integrated into the first.\n\nWennerberg is right to identify the “slop” as a threat, but wrong to suggest we can defeat it with nostalgia. Retreating to “software arts and crafts” doesn’t change anything (I’m still for it though); it merely leaves the engine of modern society running on autopilot, optimized only for profit.\n\nFeenberg offers a harder, but more effective path: don’t abandon the machine – hack it. By embedding human values into our definitions of efficiency and refusing to accept raw functionality as the final standard, we stop being victims of technique. The goal is not to escape the future, but to shape it.\n\nNow it’s time for me to go write some code.",

    "fullText": "Gold girlies, rejoice: Tiffany & Co. will be moving away from silver jewelry.\n\nThe New York-based luxury jewelry company is pivoting away from silver jewelry and going all in on gold and high jewelry, executives from its parent company LVMH said in a Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\"Tiffany had excellent products, but we redirected the house so that it can develop in jewelry and high jewelry, fewer silver products,\" said Bernard Arnault, the French luxury giant's CEO.\n\nLVMH's group managing director, Stéphane Bianchi, said Tiffany is \"hugely focused\" on silver products, but the group is pushing the brand toward gold and high jewelry. High jewelry is crafted from precious metals like gold and rare gemstones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.\n\nBianchi said demand for high jewelry has quadrupled over the last four years, while demand for silver jewelry has declined by a third since LVMH acquired Tiffany in 2021. The $15.8 billion acquisition was LVMH's biggest to date.\n\nThis is a significant shift for Tiffany, which has specialized in silver throughout its history. It was the first American company to use the British standard for 92% pure silver in its jewelry in 1851.\n\nAnd its first international recognition came from the 1867 Paris Exposition, where the company was awarded for its silverware.\n\nTiffany is part of LVMH's watches and jewelry division. In LVMH's latest earnings report, the division reported €10.5 billion in sales, or about $12.6 billion, in 2025, a 1% decline from the previous year. LVMH's stock price is down about 22% in the past year.\n\nRepresentatives for Tiffany and LVMH did not respond to queries from Business Insider about how this change would affect the supply of Tiffany's existing silver products.\n\nTiffany's shift comes amid a historic rally in the precious metals complex.\n\nGold and silver prices have surged to record highs over the past year, driven by geopolitical tensions linked to President Donald Trump's trade agenda, aggressive central-bank buying, and FOMO-fueled retail demand.\n\nSpot gold broke above $3,000 per troy ounce in March, climbed to $4,000 in October, and smashed past $5,000 earlier this week. Gold prices are up about 20% so far this year after surging 73% in 2025, and are currently trading around $5,240 per ounce.\n\nSilver has followed gold's meteoric rise, with speculative frenzy — particularly from China — fueling a red-hot rally. The price of the white metal breached $100 per ounce last week and is now trading around $115.\n\nSilver's gains have far outpaced gold's. Spot silver is up 56% year to date after soaring 170% last year.\n\nThe white metal's rapid ascent has left it looking stretched relative to gold, which has historically served as a haven asset and store of value.\n\nThe gold-to-silver ratio — which measures how many ounces of silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold — has fallen to a four-year low, signaling that silver now \"appears expensive,\" according to a Monday note from BMI Research.",

Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider.\n\n\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the accompanying message read. \"The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed.\"\n\n\"Changes like this are hard on everyone,\" Aubrey's message continued. \"These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.\"\n\nAmazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated.\n\n\"Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?\" one employee wrote.\n\nOthers saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent.\n\n\"Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it,\" one person wrote. \"Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today.\"\n\nIt remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts.

    "fullText": "In the early planning stages of Disneyland, Walt Disney employed an unconventional research method that would forever change the way theme parks approach waste management. Instead of relying on assumptions, he went straight to the \n\nWalt Disney was known for his meticulous attention to detail, but perhaps less known is his dedication to understanding customer behavior. Before opening Disneyland in 1955, he spent countless hours visiting other amusement parks, not just to study their attractions, but to observe how people interacted with their environment.\n\n\"I've been to amusement parks all over the world,\" Disney once remarked, \"and I've seen what works and what doesn't. But more importantly, I've watched how people behave in these parks – that's where the real lessons are.\"\n\nDuring his research, Disney made a crucial observation about human behavior regarding trash disposal. He noticed a consistent pattern: visitors would carry their garbage for approximately 30 steps before giving up and dropping it on the ground. This wasn't a reflection of bad manners – it was simply human nature when proper disposal options weren't readily available.\n\n\"People won't walk more than 30 steps to put garbage in a container,\" Disney explained to his design team. \"And if they don't see a receptacle within that distance, they'll just drop it wherever they are.\"\n\nThis insight led to one of Disneyland's most fundamental design principles: the \"30-Step Rule.\" Disney mandated that trash cans be placed no more than 30 steps apart throughout the park. He personally supervised the placement of each container, often pacing out the steps himself to ensure optimal positioning.\n\nVan France, one of Disney's original team members, recalled: \"Walt would walk through the park with a hot dog, taking bite after bite, counting the steps until he needed to dispose of the wrapper. He was constantly thinking about the guest experience, down to the smallest detail.\"\n\nToday, decades after Walt Disney's original research, this principle remains a cornerstone of Disney parks worldwide. Visitors can still find a trash receptacle within 30 steps of wherever they stand – a testament to the enduring value of Walt's customer research. Modern Disney parks maintain over 1,000 trash cans per location, with Magic Kingdom alone housing over 2,000 receptacles.\n\nThe trash can study wasn't Disney's only foray into customer research. His commitment to understanding visitor behavior led to several other revolutionary park features:\n\n\"You don't build it for yourself,\" Disney often said. \"You know what people want and you build it for them.\"\n\nThe 30-step rule has influenced public space design well beyond theme parks. Modern urban planners and retail designers frequently cite Disney's research when placing waste receptacles in:\n\nAs Dick Nunis, former Chairman of Walt Disney Attractions, noted: \"Walt's genius wasn't just in creating entertainment – it was in understanding human nature and designing around it.\"\n\nThe 30-step rule demonstrates how foundational research can create lasting solutions. As Disney himself put it: \"When people walk into the park, they don't want to think about trash cans. But they do want a clean park. Our job is to solve problems they didn't even know they had.\"\n\nWhat started as a simple observation became a powerful example of how customer research, when done right, can create solutions that stand the test of time. Walt Disney's approach to the trash can problem wasn't just about keeping the park clean – it was about understanding human nature and designing around it, a principle that continues to influence customer-centric design across industries today.",

    "description": "WhatsApp has adopted and rolled out a new layer of security for users – built with Rust – as part of its effort to harden defenses against malware threats. WhatsApp’s experience creating and distri…",
    "fullText": "WhatsApp provides default end-to-end encryption for over 3 billion people to message securely each and every day. Online security is an adversarial space, and to continue ensuring users can keep messaging securely, we’re constantly adapting and evolving our strategy against cyber-security threats – all while supporting the WhatsApp infrastructure to help people connect.\n\nFor example, WhatsApp, like many other applications, allows users to share media and other types of documents. WhatsApp helps protect users by warning about dangerous attachments like APKs, yet rare and sophisticated malware could be hidden within a seemingly benign file like an image or video. These maliciously crafted files might target unpatched vulnerabilities in the operating system, libraries distributed by the operating system, or the application itself.\n\nTo help protect against such potential threads, WhatsApp is increasingly using the Rust programming language, including in our media sharing functionality. Rust is a memory safe language offering numerous security benefits. We believe that this is the largest rollout globally of any library written in Rust.\n\nTo help explain why and how we rolled this out, we should first look back at a key OS-level vulnerability that sent an important signal to WhatsApp around hardening media-sharing defenses.\n\nIn 2015, Android devices, and the applications that ran on them, became vulnerable to the “Stagefright” vulnerability. The bug lay in the processing of media files by operating system-provided libraries, so WhatsApp and other applications could not patch the underlying vulnerability. Because it could often take months for people to update to the latest version of their software, we set out to find solutions that would keep WhatsApp users safe, even in the event of an operating system vulnerability.\n\nAt that time, we realized that a cross-platform C++ library already developed by WhatsApp to send and consistently format MP4 files (called “wamedia”) could be modified to detect files which do not adhere to the MP4 standard and might trigger bugs in a vulnerable OS library on the receiver side – hence putting a target’s security at risk. We rolled out this check and were able to protect WhatsApp users from the Stagefright vulnerability much more rapidly than by depending on users to update the OS itself.\n\nBut because media checks run automatically on download and process untrusted inputs, we identified early on that wamedia was a prime candidate for using a memory safe language.\n\nRather than an incremental rewrite, we developed the Rust version of wamedia in parallel with the original C++ version. We used differential fuzzing and extensive integration and unit tests to ensure compatibility between the two implementations.\n\nTwo major hurdles were the initial binary size increase due to bringing in the Rust standard library and the build system support required for the diverse platforms supported by WhatsApp. WhatsApp made a long-term bet to build that support. In the end, we replaced 160,000 lines of C++ (excluding tests) with 90,000 lines of Rust (including tests). The Rust version showed performance and runtime memory usage advantages over the C++. Given this success, Rust was fully rolled out to all WhatsApp users and many platforms: Android, iOS, Mac, Web, Wearables, and more. With this positive evidence in hand, memory safe languages will play an ever increasing part in WhatsApp’s overall approach to application and user security.\n\nOver time, we’ve added more checks for non-conformant structures within certain file types to help protect downstream libraries from parser differential exploit attempts. Additionally, we check higher risk file types, even if structurally conformant, for risk indicators. For instance, PDFs are often a vehicle for malware, and more specifically, the presence of embedded files and scripting elements within a PDF further raise risks. We also detect when one file type masquerades as another, through a spoofed extension or MIME type. Finally, we uniformly flag known dangerous file types, such as executables or applications, for special handling in the application UX. Altogether, we call this ensemble of checks “Kaleidoscope.” This system protects people on WhatsApp from potentially malicious unofficial clients and attachments. Although format checks will not stop every attack, this layer of defense helps mitigate many of them.\n\nEach month, these libraries are distributed to billions of phones, laptops, desktops, watches, and browsers running on multiple operating systems for people on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. This is the largest ever deployment of Rust code to a diverse set of end-user platforms and products that we are aware of. Our experience speaks to the production-readiness and unique value proposition of Rust on the client-side.\n\nThis is just one example of WhatsApp’s many investments in security. It’s why we built default end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls, offer end-to-end encrypted backups, and use key transparency technology to verify a secure connection, provide additional calling protections, and more.\n\nWhatsApp has a strong track record of being loud when we find issues and working to hold bad actors accountable. For example, WhatsApp reports CVEs for important issues we find in our applications, even if we do not find evidence of exploitation. We do this to give people on WhatsApp the best chance of protecting themselves by seeing a security advisory and updating quickly.\n\nTo ensure application security, we first must identify and quantify the sources of risk. We do this through internal and external audits like NCC Group’s public assessment of WhatsApp’s end-to-end encrypted backups, fuzzing, static analysis, supply chain management, and automated attack surface analysis. We also recently expanded our Bug Bounty program to introduce the WhatsApp Research Proxy – a tool that makes research into WhatsApp’s network protocol more effective.\n\nNext, we reduce the identified risk. Like many others in the industry, we found that the majority of the high severity vulnerabilities we published were due to memory safety issues in code written in the C and C++ programming languages. To combat this we invest in three parallel strategies:\n\nWhatsApp has added protections like CFI, hardened memory allocators, safer buffer handling APIs, and more.

    "fullText": "The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, co-directed by Daniel Roher, delves into the world of AI through the lens of personal anxiety\n\nAre we barreling toward AI catastrophe? Is AI an existential threat, or an epochal opportunity? Those are the questions top of mind for a new documentary at Sundance, which features leading AI experts, critics and entrepreneurs, including Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, with views on the near-to-midterm future ranging from doom to utopia.\n\nThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, directed by Daniel Roher and Charlie Tyrell and produced by Daniel Kwan (one half of The Daniels, the Oscar-winning duo behind Everything Everywhere All At Once), delves into the contentious topic of AI through Roher’s own anxiety. The Canadian film-maker, who won an Oscar in 2023 for the documentary Navalny, first became interested in the topic while experimenting with tools released by OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot ChatGPT. The sophistication of the public tools – the ability to produce whole paragraphs in seconds, or produce illustrations – both thrilled and unnerved him. AI was already radically shaping the filmmaking industry, and proclamations on the promise and peril of AI were everywhere, with little way for people outside the tech industry to evaluate them. As an artist, he wondered, how was he to make sense of it all?\n\nRoher’s anxiety only increased when he and his wife, fellow film-maker Caroline Lindy, learned that they were expecting their first child. “It felt like the whole world was rushing into something without thinking,” he says in the film, as his excitement for parenthood collided with dread over the unknown variable of AI, which in just a few short years went from proprietary experiment to public good.\n\nThe AI Doc thus arises out of Roher’s most pressing question: is it safe to bring a child into this world? Alongside Kwan, Roher convened a series of experts to both explain the mechanics of the tech – and clarify some nebulous, alienating terms – and search for an answer. (It is both comforting and a little disturbing, for example, that no one seems to have a clear answer to the question “what is AI?”). In individual sit-down interviews, leading machine learning researchers including Yoshua Bengio, Ilya Sutskever and DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg all agree that there are aspects of AI models that humans cannot and will never be able to understand. Standard AI models are trained on “more data than anyone could ever read in several lifetimes”, as one machine learning expert puts it. And the pace of machine learning exceeds that of precedent – or film. “Any example you put in this movie will look absolutely clumsy by the time the movie comes out,” Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and a prominent voice in the apocalyptic 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, tells Roher.\n\nThe film first hears from a series of doomerists, or people concerned AI – and in particular Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a still-theoretical form of AI whose capabilities exceed those of humans – could lead to the extermination of humanity, including Harris, his Center for Humane Technology co-founder Aza Raskin, Ajeya Cotra, an AI risk adviser, and Eli Yudkowsky, an AI alignment pioneer. Such figures warn that humans could very easily lose control of super-intelligent AI models, with little to no recourse. Yudkowsky’s 2025 book is bluntly titled If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.\n\nAI companies, they say, are unprepared for the consequences of reaching AGI, which could “become superhuman maybe in this decade”, says Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety. Should humans no longer be the most intelligent beings on Earth, they warn, it is possible that AGI would view the species as irrelevant. Connor Leahy, co-founder of EleutherAI, compared the potential future relationship of super-intelligent AGI and humans to that of humans and ants: “We don’t hate ants. But if we want to build a highway” over an anthill – “well, sucks for the ant.”\n\nSeveral in the doomer camp, many of whom do not have children, react discouragingly to Roher’s question about parenthood. “I know people who work on AI risk who don’t expect their child to make it to high school,” says Harris, in a line that drew gasps from a preview audience in Park City.\n\nOn the other side are optimistic figures such as Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPRIZE Foundation trying to extend human life, who claims that “children born today are about to enter a period of glorious transformation”; Guillaume Verdon, a leader of the “effective accelerationism” movement in Silicon Valley; Peter Lee, the president of Microsoft Research; and Daniela Amodei, the co-founder and president of OpenAI rival Anthropic. So-called “accelerationists” see AI as a potential cure to a myriad of seemingly intractable issues afflicting humanity: cancer, food and water shortages for an ever-growing population, insufficient renewable energy and perhaps most pressing, climate emergency. Without AI, they argue, countless future lives would be lost to drought, famine, disease and natural catastrophes.\n\nDevelopment of AI, however, relies on computing power, which requires vast amounts of energy. A final group of interviewees, critics and observers largely outside the tech world – including Karen Hao, a journalist and author of the book Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI, and Liv Boeree, Win-Win podcast hos – connect AI to the tangible, physical world, such as the data centers sucking up water in the American west, leaving residents with sky-high electricity bills and drained reservoirs. The current narratives around AI, according to Emily M Bender, a computational linguistics professor, exclude and dehumanize the people it is already impacting, and will continue to disrupt.\n\nRoher eventually arrives at the five most powerful people – all men – currently leading the AI arms race: Altman; Elon Musk, the xAI CEO; Dario Amodei, the Anthropic CEO; Demis Hassabis of DeepMind and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg. Altman, Amodei and Hassabis sit for interviews that more or less defend their companies’ respective positions. According to the film, Zuckerberg declined to participate; Musk agreed but then got too busy.\n\nAltman, who at the time of the interview was expecting his first child, insists that he’s “not scared for a kid to grow up in a world with AI”. He and his husband Oliver Mulherin welcomed their son via a surrogate in February 2025, an event Altman later said “neurochemically hacked” his brain, leading people in his life to think that he would “make better decisions” for OpenAI and ChatGPT when it comes to “humanity as a whole”. The 40-year-old CEO went on to say that both his and Roher’s child would likely “never be smarter than AI” which “does unsettle me a little bit, but it is reality”.\n\nAt one point, Roher asks Altman if it is indeed impossible to reassure him that everything in regards to AI is going to be OK. “That is impossible,” Altman affirms, though he does say that OpenAI’s lead in the AI arms race allows it to spend more time on safety testing.\n\nThe AI Doc ultimately lands somewhere in between doomerism and optimism – apocaloptimism, as they call it, searching for “a path between the promise and the peril”. That path should include, according to numerous film subjects: significant, sustained, paradigm-shifting international coordination, akin the mid-century frameworks and agreements introduced to moderate the development of atomic weapons – more corporate transparency for AI companies, an independent regulatory body to police AI developers, legal liability for the companies’ products, such as ChatGPT, mandatory disclosure of genAI use for media and a willingness to keep adapting the rules for rapidly shifting tech.\n\nWhether or not the US government and companies, let alone the world, can do it remains an open question, with differing opinions on first steps. But if there is one thing the many subjects all agree on, it’s that there’s no going back to a time before AI. As Anthropic co-founder and CEO Amodei puts it: “This train isn’t going to stop.”\n\nThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released on 27 March",

    "fullText": "Popularity of EVs in country is part of global trend of emerging markets spurning fossil fuel cars at surprising speeds\n\nWhen Berke Astarcıoğlu bought a BMW i3 in 2016, he was one of just 44 people in a country of 80 million to buy a battery electric vehicle (BEV) that year. By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity in Turkey, making up 7% of new car sales.\n\nFast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.\n\n“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”\n\nBEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.\n\nIts electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkey prepares to host the UN climate summit, and one month after the EU watered down its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.\n\nAnalysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.\n\n“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”\n\nElectrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.\n\nThe Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.\n\nTogg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”\n\nForeign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to a report by InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.\n\nWhile imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.\n\nHowever, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.\n\n“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”\n\nAnalysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.\n\n“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”",

    "fullText": "Jan 28 (Reuters) - China has approved its first batch of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips for import, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking a shift in position as China ​seeks to balance its AI needs against spurring domestic development.\n\nThe approval covers several hundred thousand H200 chips ‌and was granted during Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang's visit to China this week, the sources said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity ‌of the matter.\n\nThe first batch of approvals has been allocated primarily to three major Chinese internet companies, with other enterprises now joining a queue for subsequent approvals, one of the sources said.\n\nThey declined to name the companies that received the initial clearances.\n\nChina's industry and commerce ministries as well as Nvidia had not yet responded to requests for comment at the time ⁠of publication.\n\nThe H200, Nvidia's second most ‌powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations. Despite strong demand from Chinese firms and U.S. approval for exports, Beijing's hesitation to allow imports has been ‍the main barrier to shipments.\n\nThe U.S. earlier this month formally cleared the way for Nvidia to sell the H200 to China, where the company is seeing strong appetite. However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be ​shipped in.\n\nIt was unclear in recent weeks whether Beijing would grant approval as the government wants to balance ‌meeting surging domestic demand for advanced AI chips and nurturing its domestic semiconductor industry.\n\nChinese customs authorities told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month.\n\nBut Chinese technology firms have placed orders for more than two million H200 chips, far exceeding Nvidia's available inventory, Reuters reported last month.\n\nIt remains uncertain how many additional companies will receive approval in subsequent batches or what criteria Beijing is using to determine eligibility.\n\nHuang arrived ⁠in Shanghai last Friday for routine annual celebrations with Nvidia's China ​employees and has since travelled to Beijing and other cities, Reuters ​reported last week.\n\nThe approvals of H200 suggest Beijing is prioritising the needs of major Chinese internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centres needed to develop AI ‍services and compete with U.S. ⁠rivals, including OpenAI.\n\nWhile Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the performance of Nvidia's H20 chip, previously the most advanced AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, they still ⁠lag far behind the H200.",

    "title": "Average 401(k) Withdrawal Rate for Retirees in 2026 Revealed—What Does It Mean for You?",
    "description": "Recent research reveals retirees withdraw just 2.1% of their savings annually—about half the amount experts recommend. Here's what the data shows.",
    "fullText": "Recent research shows that married retirees withdraw about 2.1% of their savings annually, while spending 80% of their guaranteed income, like Social Security.\n\nMorningstar's latest analysis suggests retirees can safely withdraw 3.9% to start, close to the classic 4% annual withdrawal rule\n\nThose willing to adjust spending based on market conditions could take out up to almost 6%.\n\nDecember 2025 research from Morningstar raised its recommended safe withdrawal rate to 3.9%,up from 3.7% the prior year. But actual retiree behavior tells a different story.\n\nWhy do most retirees withdraw less than recommended?\n\nWhat withdrawal rate do experts currently recommend for retirees?\n\nHow does guaranteed income affect retirement withdrawal behavior?\n\nWhat's the difference between flexible and fixed withdrawal strategies?\n\nThe Morningstar figure comes close to the 4% rule, which is one of the best-known in personal finance: it's the percentage of your retirement savings you should withdraw in your first year. Every year afterward, you adjust the percentage for inflation, and, if you have enough saved, your money should last for your retirement. But recent research shows many retirees aren't even close to this traditional guideline.\n\nA 2025 study in Financial Planning Review by David Blanchett and Michael Finke found that married 65-year-olds with at least $100,000 in assets withdraw just 2.1% per year from their retirement accounts. Single retirees take out even less, about 1.9%. Meanwhile, retirees spend about 80% of their guaranteed income, like Social Security, but only ever expend about half of their retirement savings.\n\nThe result is that while most people fear they won't have enough to retire on, many retirees are living more frugally than they might need to, potentially missing out on experiences they spent a lifetime saving for. But for others, a lower withdrawal rate isn't unfounded—it's prudent based on the math of trying to float a retirement with less.\n\nWe take you through what you need to know below.\n\nReviewing the accounts of 70,000 retirees age 60 and over, Vanguard's findings reveal just how cautious—and inconsistent—many retirees are in taking withdrawals:\n\nOnly about a third withdrew money during each of the years Vanguard reviewed, and just 20% of that group maintained a steady withdrawal rate considered to be between 3% and 10% annually.\n\nThe median retiree in Vanguard's sample had a 401(k) balance of $133,000 at retirement, about 2.2 years' worth of income. It's no surprise that those who cashed out entirely tended to have smaller balances and lower income before they retired.\n\nThat $133,000 median balance is a critical detail. At the traditional 4% withdrawal rate, that provides about $5,300 a year—helpful for paying bills, but not nearly enough to fund a retirement. For retirees with more modest retirement savings, cautious spending isn't a psychological quirk but a prudent approach to having fewer resources.",

A Tesla driver’s routine stop at a public charging station turned into a frustrating episode, and the moment was immortalized on vehicle security cameras.\n\nThe story, first shared by the owner on the Reddit forum r/TeslaModelY, quickly spread through EV and automotive circles, lighting debates over charging-station security, equipment vulnerability, and even the readiness of public infrastructure for mass EV adoption.\n\nWe recently reported an emerging trend of EV charger thefts, targeted for their copper, and costing charging stations hundreds of thousands of dollars in replacement costs.\n\nIn this story, the owner reported plugging in at a public charger and stepping away for roughly 30 minutes — only to return and find that a critical charging accessory had been stolen. The item taken was a J1772 adapter, an essential piece of hardware that allows Tesla drivers to connect to non-Tesla charging stations.\n\nBeyond the theft itself, what made this more than just a petty theft story was how the incident was captured. The Tesla’s built-in surveillance, a combination of Sentry Mode and external cameras designed to protect the vehicle, recorded the interaction.\n\nAnd that’s how the owner and others in the EV community could see exactly what happened. The video showed a woman approaching the car and removing the adapter — an act that, until now, many drivers assumed would be deterred by Tesla’s lock-in features that secure charging ports.\n\nIn follow-up comments, the Tesla owner explained that they were unaware the locking feature had not been enabled. Unfortunately, that small oversight came with significant consequence. After sharing the footage, the owner managed to locate and recover the adapter, and plans to enable the lock feature on future visits.\n\nNot merely a quirky footnote in the life of a Tesla owner, this story reflects broader stresses in the rapidly evolving EV ecosystem.\n\nA sustained EV proliferation will sustain increasing demand for public charging infrastructure. Early adopters often praise the environmental benefits and futuristic tech of EVs, but incidents like this, however seemingly inconsequential, can further undermine confidence in the reliability and security of the charging network. This is especially the case with cautious EV converts still on the fence.\n\nCharging stations, especially those maintained by third-party providers or local councils, are typically unmanned and scattered across public spaces such as shopping centers, highway rest stops, and municipal lots. Unlike a fuel pump at a gas station — where attendants, lighting, and surveillance have evolved over decades — EV chargers are still figuring out the human and security infrastructure needed to go with the hardware.\n\nThis gap has proven to make them ripe targets for theft, vandalism, and misuse. It used to be that the main complaint was about EV owners who treat charging stations as car-sitters; now people have to worry about their chargers being targets for thieves.\n\nTeslas are famous for their advanced camera systems and a mode called Sentry Mode, which uses the car’s exterior cameras to monitor and record suspicious activity around the car when left unattended.\n\nOriginally designed to combat vandalism and break-ins, Sentry Mode has, over the years, captured everything from graffiti attacks to attempted thefts. It has proven a powerful tool for owners and, in some cases, law enforcement.\n\nYet this very bounty of data raises questions deeper than whether thieves might target an adapter. As more incidents are recorded and shared online, concerns about privacy, data usage, and surveillance are surfacing in tandem.\n\nCameras ‘catch’ a thief snatching a charger, and people suddenly remember that Tesla and other automakers amass enormous amounts of footage and sensor data that, while invaluable in cases of vandalism or accident reconstruction, could also be mishandled or misused.\n\nAn insurer says they’re cutting prices in half for cars running FSD (Tesla’s full self-driving technology), and we’re wondering what that means for driving data being shared with an insurance provider. That tension has already drawn scrutiny and criticism from privacy advocates.\n\nGirl stole my J1772 adapter\nbyu/uglah inTeslaModelY\n\nThere are several key takeaways for the average Tesla or EV owner:\n\nEnable all available security features — including charging port locks and Sentry Mode — to deter theft and protect equipment.\n\nBe aware of the surrounding environment when using public chargers; well-lit, high-traffic areas will always be safer.\n\nRecord and share incidents responsibly — community vigilance helps highlight weaknesses in public infrastructure and encourages operators to step up security.\n\nThis episode offers a snapshot of an industry in transition. A growing EV adoption will expose gaps in charging security, public awareness, and infrastructure readiness. It’s normal, and stories like this, amplified by social media and the built-in cameras of the vehicles themselves, help reveal how advanced driver-owned tech has become and how imperfect the human and civic systems around it still are.",

    "fullText": "A resurfaced incident from June 2022 about a Yellowstone National Park bison attack is drawing attention online, as viewers react to yet another reminder of how quickly wildlife encounters can turn dangerous when people get too close.\n\nABC News reported the occurrence at the time, detailing how a bull bison gored a 71-year-old woman while she visited the park — the third bison attack at Yellowstone that year.\n\nAccording to park officials, the woman and her daughter were heading back to their vehicle at Storm Point near Yellowstone Lake when they inadvertently approached the animal, causing it to charge. The woman suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a nearby hospital in Cody, Wyoming.\n\nThe story continues to circulate online as an example of how easily visitors can misjudge wild animals' behavior, especially during peak seasons.\n\nYellowstone urges visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from bison and other large animals. Despite appearing calm, bison are unpredictable and can run up to three times faster than humans.\n\n\"Mother bison are extremely protective of their calves in spring, and bulls can be more aggressive in July and August,\" Dennis Jorgensen, a bison program manager at the World Wildlife Fund, told ABC News.\n\nSimilar incidents have continued in the years since, with Yellowstone reporting additional bison-related injuries in 2024 and 2025, which are often tied to visitors approaching animals too closely for photos or videos.\n\nBeyond the danger to people, these encounters can also endanger wildlife. Animals that injure humans — even when provoked — may be euthanized, removing healthy animals from protected ecosystems because of human behavior.\n\nCommenters responding to ABC News' coverage on Facebook emphasized that the responsibility lies with visitors, not wildlife.\n\n\"I don't understand why such simple rules are broken these are wild animals and you are driving in their home,\" one person said.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother commenter wrote: \"The Rules are for Humans to follow. These animals are doing what's natural, instinct, it's their home and people should respect these awesome creatures.\"\n\n\"This is their habitat. Give the animals space and respect,\" a third user added.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Silver is making a major run higher amid tightening export controls in China and meme-stock-style buying by Main Street investors hoping to squeeze bearish bets.\n\nThe precious metal is up an eye-popping 249% over the past year, including a 47% year-to-date jump, but not everyone thinks silver prices are destined to keep climbing.\n\n2021: -11.55%\n\nFormer JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic and famous Wall Street trader Peter Brandt both sounded alarms on silver in separate posts on X (the former Twitter) this week.\n\nThe stakes are high for investors, given that silver has gone parabolic, surging in a straight line, sparking animal spirits among those hoping to reap even bigger gains.\n\nNew buyers, however, should remember that precious metals are notorious for boom-and-bust moves, making new positions riskier now than they were months ago.\n\nOn Jan. 1, China designated silver as a strategic resource, alongside rare earth minerals. The move restricts silver exports, requiring licenses that have become harder to get. Only 44 companies qualified for silver export licenses as China seeks to guarantee supply for next-gen solar, EVs, and electronics technologies.\n\nThe move accelerated a rally that emerged last year, driven by bullishness over industrial demand for high-tech applications and, more generally, by rising interest among investors eager to diversify portfolios by owning silver ETFs, such as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), or physical silver, such as coins and bars.\n\nThe numbers are truly massive. Silver's move has lifted the market's size above $6 trillion. Putting that figure into perspective, Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet boast market caps of $4.5 trillion, $3.75 trillion, and $4 trillion, respectively.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nEveryone wants in on the action.\n\nOn January 26, the iShares Silver Trust exchange-traded fund saw turnover of nearly $40 billion, according to Bloomberg, a figure similar to that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the go-to ETF for the 500 most influential publicly traded companies. That's nearly 20x higher than it had been averaging for most of last year.\n\nMoves like this aren't common, and they're often warning shots to which investors ought to pay attention. I've been tracking markets for more than 30 years, and I've seen more than my fair share of jaw-dropping pops that eventually turned into drops.",

Four of the deceased were passengers, while the other two on board were flight crew. There were no survivors. (The FAA said in an initial notice that seven had died, with one survivor, who was seriously injured.)\n\nA news release shared by the airport on Monday, Jan. 26, read, \"According to the flight manifest there were six people on the flight. No one from the incident was transported to the hospital, and all on the flight are presumed to be deceased. The identities of the people on the flight are not being released publicly at this time, pending positive identification.\"\n\nJacob Hosmer was the captain of the flight, NBC affiliate KPRC reported. The Houston-area pilot, 47, was confirmed to have been among the victims of the crash by his father, Gary.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“He’s in Heaven now with Jesus,” Gary told the outlet.\n\nA friend, who knew Hosmer for 15 years as an aviation specialist, said, \"I would describe him as a great pilot, a loving husband, and a phenomenal father,” adding, “He was always kind. He was always laughing.\"\n\nThe plane involved in the crash had arrived from Texas, according to Reuters. It is registered to a company with a Houston address shared with the personal injury law firm Arnold & Itkin.\n\nHosmer had Houston-based injury law firm Arnold & Itkin LLP listed as his employer on LinkedIn since May 2025.\n\nThe firm's founders, Kurt Arnold and Jason Itkin, were not on the aircraft, multiple sources told ABC affiliate KTRK.\n\nHowever, Kurt's wife, attorney Tara Arnold, was reportedly killed in the crash, sources told the outlet.\n\nHarris County Commissioner Lesley Briones, a close friend of the family, told the outlet, \"I'm close friends with Kurt and Tara Arnold, and we're still waiting for additional information. Unfortunately, the plane went down (Sunday) evening in Maine, and my heart hurts for them, for their children, and for their families.\"\n\nArnold & Itkin have not shared an official statement about the crash as of Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\n\"She was a phenomenal person, a bold leader, and someone with a heart of service,\" Briones continued of Tara, according to KTRK. \"She was very involved in Precinct 4 and our nonprofit, Precinct 4 Forward. My heart is with Kurt, their children, and everyone affected.\"\n\nEvent planner Shawna Collins was also on board the aircraft, according to her daughter, the outlet reported. Collins reportedly spoke to her daughter about the business trip just before the flight, which was heading to Europe.\n\nThe Bangor Police Department did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for confirmation of the victims' IDs on Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\nIn an audio recording of air traffic controllers’ conversation following the crash, one person said, “Aircraft upside down. We have a passenger aircraft upside down.”\n\nFirst responders arrived at the scene less than a minute after the conversation about the upside-down aircraft, airport director Jose Saavedra said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe plane caught fire after the crash, according to the FAA. The exact circumstances surrounding the crash remain unclear.\n\nThe airport was being impacted by Winter Storm Fern, with snow falling at the time of the crash, CBS affiliate KHOU and Reuters reported.",

(WKRN) — Thousands across Middle Tennessee have not had reliable electricity for days as crews work around the clock to try to restore power to customers.\n\nIn one South Nashville neighborhood, News 2 spoke with Adonis Marzos, who said he’s staying at his cousin’s house because his home hasn’t had power since Saturday.\n\n“If we didn’t have somebody, we wouldn’t know what to do. it may be freezing inside the house… “…It may be 32 degrees [in the house].”\n\nResidents on Ellington Circle told News 2 people have been going to their cars to warm up and charge their phones.\n\nRELATED | Power outages persist in aftermath of winter storm\n\nAsia Witaker said she’s staying at a friend’s home because her home hasn’t had power since Sunday morning.\n\n“We lost power around 6:30 — 6:43 in the morning on Sunday and we sort of dealt with it, but the house was really cold and then Sunday night, it got really cold and we were just kind of over it,” Whitaker told News 2. “By the next morning, it was freezing and I was sitting on the couch in a puffer jacket and several layers of pants texting about trying to figure out what to do and my fingers were freezing, and I was like ‘Okay, this isn’t sustainable.'”\n\nAs of 4 p.m. Tuesday, Nashville Electric Service said there’s still about 119,000 customers without power. At least 216 broken poles were reported as broken across their service area. The utility said it deployed about 700 line workers Tuesday morning as well as 207 vegetation management teams.\n\nNeighborhoods with outages of 1,000 customers or more include:\n\nNES said they’ve been restoring power by tackling areas affecting the largest number of customers first.\n\nIf you are without power, please report it by texting OUT to 637797 (NESPWR) from the phone number linked to your account, or by calling (615) 234‑0000.\n\nDon’t forget to take the power and reliability of the WKRN Weather Authority with you at all times by downloading the News 2 Storm Tracker app.",

U.S. firm Micron plans a 45% rise to $20 billion.\n\nA quarter of chipmaker capex is spent on lithography, analysts estimate, largely going to ASML, and this proportion could be higher with ⁠AI chips, driven by demand from players like Apple, Google, and Qualcomm.",

    "fullText": "A move that resonates well beyond a simple change of office address sees Ford Motor Company confirmed that its Lincoln luxury brand will shift its corporate headquarters to Michigan Central Station in Detroit in February 2026.\n\nThe new location will house Lincoln’s marketing, sales, and service leadership teams, while design and engineering functions will remain at Ford’s primary Dearborn campus, now anchored by the new Ford World Headquarters.\n\nAt face value, this relocation might look like a real estate shuffle. But for industry watchers with an eye toward long term strategy, it represents a deliberate effort by Ford to reshape Lincoln’s identity and carve out a distinct role for the luxury marque in a crowded and rapidly evolving market.\n\nMichigan Central Station was once one of the most iconic transportation hubs in the United States. It opened in 1913 and served thousands of passengers a day until rail travel declined sharply in the mid-20th century.\n\nAfter lying abandoned for decades, Ford acquired and undertook an extensive renovation of the station and surrounding campus beginning in 2018, creating a 640,000-square-foot innovation district designed to attract tech partners and startups alongside Ford employees.\n\nThis context is important because Ford’s decision to base Lincoln at Michigan Central couldn’t have been simply a branding exercise. It places the luxury brand at the center of a testbed for future technologies, from autonomous systems to new mobility services.\n\nThe innovation district already hosts Ford’s Model e electric vehicle team and external partners like Newlab, creating a synergy that Lincoln’s leadership must hope will fuel fresh thinking.\n\nLincoln, Ford, Michigan Central Station, Detroit, headquarters, relocation, luxury brand, corporate strategy, innovation district, automotive news, Corktown, brand identity, Joaquin Nuño-Whelan.\n\nLincoln has historically been intertwined with Ford corporate operations. Until recently, the brand’s leaders shared office space with Ford’s global executives in Dearborn’s famed Glass House, a mid-century architectural landmark that served as Ford’s headquarters from 1956 until late 2025.\n\nThe new Ford World Headquarters, known internally as “The Hub,” has replaced the Glass House as Ford’s administrative center. It brings thousands of employees into closer collaboration on product development and corporate strategy. But Lincoln’s leadership must have seen an opportunity in stepping outside that central locus.",

Alongside our allies, we are stepping ⁠up our response to shadow vessels – and we will continue ​to do so,\" the spokesperson added, referring to ships ​that transport oil under sanctions.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the U.S. Coast Guard or the Scottish government.\n\nAnwar said the other 26 crew of the Marinera, formerly ‍known as the Bella-1, ⁠had been processed at a British army centre in Inverness. Five had chosen to travel to the United States, while the others chose alternative travel arrangements to their home countries, ⁠Anwar said.\n\nLast week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had expected the U.S. to free the crew members, ‌which he said included two Russians, as well as Ukrainians, Georgians and Indians.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks made a two-for-one deal when they cut ties with Trae Young this season. CJ McCollum was the headliner of the package.\n\nSo far, the McCollum experience hasn’t gone great in the eyes of many Atlanta fans. With his shot selection frustrating spectators throughout his first few weeks of the team, McCollum has caught some heat on social media as of late.\n\nBut after a big night against the Indiana Pacers, he sent a message to his doubters.\n\nvia @CJMcCollum: Long season. Don’t fret. I really do this\n\nMcCollum’s message came right after he went 9-15 from the field and 5-7 from three, scoring 23 points in 28 minutes of action. He nearly locked up a triple-double after dishing out seven assists and coming down with eight rebounds.\n\nThe Hawks collected a comfortable victory over Indiana, winning 132-116.\n\nIn the seven games leading up to Monday’s action between the Hawks and the Pacers, McCollum averages 17.3 points per game, while shooting 43 percent from the field. Following his run with the Washington Wizards, McCollum has been struggling from three, going from hitting on 39 percent of his shots to just 26 percent with Atlanta.\n\nClearly, McCollum isn’t bothered by it. He was having a strong season with the rebuilding Wizards before the trade and seems to be confident in his ability to get settled and begin having a major impact for the Hawks, who are playoff-hopefuls this year.\n\nAfter a win over the Pacers, the Hawks are 23-25 on the year. They are in the midst of a three-game winning streak, collecting six wins over their last 10 games. Atlanta has a three-game lead over the Milwaukee Bucks for the tenth seed. They trail the ninth-seeded Bulls by just one game.\n\nThe Hawks will be back on the court on Wednesday night for a battle against the Boston Celtics.\n\nDonovan Mitchell does not want the Cavs to get ahead of themselves amid winning streak\n\nKnicks linked to 2-time NBA champion guard, ex-Celtics star in bombshell trade report\n\nLakers, Sixers among suitors for Keon Ellis",

A new name emerged as a candidate the Cardinals brought in, and it is a name out of left field.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Dianna Russini, the Cardinals managed to bring is former Carolina Panthers and Washington Commanders head coach Ron Rivera for an in-person interview for the head coaching job without it being known immediately.\n\nRivera is the general manager of Cal Football in college. He was fired from his job with the Commanders after a 4-13 2023 season.\n\nIn his career, he is 102-103-2. He went 76-63-1 with the Panthers and made the playoffs four times, once making it to the Super Bowl. He went 26-40-1 with one postseason appearance with Washington. In his time as a head coach from 2011-2023, he never had consecutive winning seasons. Two of his playoff appearances came with losing records.\n\nIs he a serious candidate to replace Jonathan Gannon? That's what we don't know. We do not know when the interview happened. It might have been early on in the process.\n\nBut with a name like that in the ether, it is something to watch, as it appears that the Cardinals are not done with their search.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick will likely be enshrined in the NFL Hall of Fame, but it won't happen in 2026.\n\nIn a shocking decision, Belichick did not receive the 80% of votes necessary for enshrinement in his first year on the ballot.\n\nDespite Belichick's eight Super Bowl rings, six as a head coach, he did not reach 40 of the 50 votes required. One of the main reasons, as outlined by Seth Wickersham, was due to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that took place during Belichick's tenure. According to an anonymous source of Wickersham's, some \"believed Belichick should 'wait a year' before induction as penance for Spygate.\"\n\nThe decision not to elect Belichick in his first year of eligibility was not well received. Despite the coach's past scandals and the current unsuccessful transition to college coaching, he is still widely accepted as deserving of the Hall of Fame and should have been elected in his first year.\n\nHere is more on the NFL world's reaction to Belichick not being a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nMORE: Why is Bill Belichick not a first ballot Hall of Famer?\n\nThe former star defender weighed in on Belichick not being elected to Canton in his first year on the ballot. Watt never played for Belichick, always against him, but that didn't stop him from respecting an NFL legend. Watt himself will be first eligible for a call to the hall in 2028.\n\nI can’t be reading this right.\n\nThis has to be some knock-off Hall of Fame or something, it can’t be the actual NFL Hall of Fame.\n\nThere is not a single world whatsoever in which Bill Belichick should not be a First-Ballot Hall of Famer. https://t.co/OXhL1Sd4FM\n\n— JJ Watt (@JJWatt) January 27, 2026\n\nButler spent nine years in the NFL. He began his career playing for Belichick in New England for two years. He then spent the 2011 season with the Carolina Panthers before ending his career with a six-year stint with the Indianapolis Colts.

He spent the majority of his career (2006 to 2013) with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Clark played against Belichick several times, but there is no doubt in his mind that Belichick is deserving of enshrinement.\n\nBill Belichick not being a first ballot Hall of Famer means that no coach should ever be. It means that the voters have decided there isn’t a coaching resume that warrants First Ballot consideration!\n\nHe is the GREATEST, most ACCOMPLISHED coach of all time! This is egregious!\n\n— Ryan Clark (@Realrclark25) January 27, 2026\n\nMahomes is likely going to find himself in Canton one day.

He never played for Belichick, but still can't believe the head coach wasn't elected.\n\nThe voters have to not remain anonymous anymore. We need an explanation for why Bill Belichick one of the greatest coaches ever of any level of any sport with 8 SB’s is not a first ballot HOF’er……… No explanation will be valid but I need to know.

    "fullText": "Six-time Super Bowl champion head coach Bill Belichick didn't get voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, according to a report from ESPN.\n\nCiting four unidentified sources, ESPN reported Tuesday that Belichick didn't receive the necessary 40 votes from the 50-person panel of media members and other Hall of Famers. ESPN said Belichick received a call from the Hall of Fame last Friday with the news.\n\nThe Hall of Fame declined to comment before its class of 2026 is announced at NFL Honors in San Francisco on Feb. 5.\n\nThe report of Belichick's snub was met with significant criticism, including from Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who posted on social media: “Insane … don’t even understand how this could be possible.”\n\nBelichick was hired by New England in 2000 and led the franchise to six Super Bowl wins and three other appearances in the title game during an 18-year span from 2001-18. Belichick’s 333 wins in the regular season and playoffs with New England and Cleveland are the second most to Don Shula’s 347. He won AP NFL Coach of the Year three times.\n\nBelichick also was one of the game’s top defensive assistants before taking over in New England, winning two earlier Super Bowls as defensive coordinator for the New York Giants.\n\nBelichick’s career did have blemishes. He was implicated in a sign-stealing scandal dubbed “Spygate” in the 2007 season and was fined $500,000 after the team was caught filming defensive signals from the New York Jets during a game.\n\nBelichick’s tenure in New England ended following the 2023 season. He just finished his first year coaching in college at North Carolina.\n\nBelichick was one of five finalists among coaches, contributors and senior players who last appeared in a game in 2000 or earlier. Patriots owner Robert Kraft was the contributor finalist, with Roger Craig, Ken Anderson and L.C. Greenwood the players.\n\nBetween one and three of those finalists will be inducted into the Hall along with between three and five modern-era players from a group of 15 finalists.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "The official unveiling of the football schedule solidifies how grueling the season could be for USC.",
    "fullText": "Entering a particularly consequential season for coach Lincoln Riley at USC, a brutal Big Ten slate won’t cut the Trojans or their coach any slack in 2026.\n\nThat much was clear long before the Big Ten officially released its schedule for next season Tuesday. USC already knew it would face the conference’s top three teams from a season ago (Indiana, Ohio State and Oregon). But the official unveiling of the slate would further solidify just how grueling the climb could be for USC next season.\n\nOregon will face Portland State, an FCS team, a week before coming to USC on Sept. 26. Ohio State will have a bye week before its Halloween meeting with USC at the Coliseum, and so will the defending champ, Indiana, which USC will face in Bloomington on Nov. 14.\n\nThe Trojans will assuredly have to win at least one of those games to maintain their hopes of making the College Football Playoff in Riley’s fifth season. The rest of the schedule is hardly a cakewalk too, with trips to Rutgers (Sept. 19), Penn State (Oct. 10) and Wisconsin (Oct. 24).\n\nThe nonconference schedule is still being finalized, after talks broke down between USC and Notre Dame over the future of their rivalry series. But with two byes already baked into the Trojans’ schedule, a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly told The Times that USC plans to schedule its season opener during Week Zero, with a home game on Aug. 29.\n\nThat timing drastically cuts down USC’s options for finding a fill-in opponent to open the season against at the Coliseum.\n\nIn order to play in Week Zero in its home stadium and not internationally or at a neutral site, USC must secure an exemption from the NCAA. That probably limits the Trojans to a team that faces Hawaii in 2026 — and thus gets an exemption from the NCAA to play an additional game — or means playing a Football Championship Series team, which USC has notably never done.\n\nStarting the season early will allow for USC to add an extra bye week, while most Big Ten schools are working with just one during their 2026 slates. It’ll need that break considering what the latter half of the season holds.\n\nAfter kicking off in late August, USC opens the season with home games in five of its first six weeks. But after that, the Trojans return home just twice the rest of the season, for matchups against Ohio State on Oct. 31 and Maryland on Nov. 21.\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Friars still undecided who will be the starting first baseman this season.",
    "fullText": "It is hard to imagine that San Diego Padres second baseman Jake Cronenworth is entering his seventh season with the franchise. A feat that should not be dismissed, as his versatility to play multiple infield positions could be key to the Padres’ success in 2026.\n\nToo often, we value hitting metrics more than fielding stats in determining a player’s importance to a team’s success. Cronenworth’s bottom-of-the-order run production, paired with his outstanding glove work, earned him a full-time starting role with the Padres since arriving in 2020.\n\nHe came to San Diego in the Hunter Renfroe trade with the Tampa Bay Rays. The Padres highly valued his versatility, as he could effectively play first base, second base and shortstop.\n\nThe intangible is his career fielding percentage (.991), as Cronenworth’s attention to detail allows him to take a challenge and usually excel in a position change. His defense does not suffer because he has maintained a utility player’s mentality, despite being the starting second baseman.\n\nCronenworth is exceptional at fielding balls hit directly at him. Other middle infielders may have more range, but it is not a guarantee that they will field each ball hit in their direction.\n\nObviously, the front office prefers to keep Cronenworth at second base, but circumstances may force him to play more at first base this season. The Friars are hoping to add another bat before opening Spring Training in Peoria, Ariz. on Feb. 11.\n\nAt the plate, Cronenworth’s value is his ability to move runners along the base paths and drive in those who are in scoring position. His standout season came in 2021, Cronenworth hit .266 (career best) with 21 HR (61 extra-base hits) and 71 RBI. He achieved a career-high 122 OPS+, which earned him his first All-Star Game appearance.\n\nLast season, Cronenworth struggled with consistency at the plate after missing time with fractured ribs. The injury limited him to a .246 batting average with 11 HR and 59 RBI in 135 games. The concern was his lack of power from the left side of the plate, as just 32 of his 103 hits were for extra-base hits.\n\nThe Padres hope Cronenworth returns to his former power-hitting, run-producing self, as this would add considerable length to the batting order.\n\nSpring Training should have the same feel for Cronenworth, as he will take fielding reps at first and second base. However, he has no clue where he will start in the regular season. Some time at first base could be in his future, especially with the uncertainty of free agent Luis Arraez possibly returning to the fold.\n\nThankfully, Cronenworth is the type of player who comes to the ballpark ready to compete. It does not matter where he plays as long as his name is in the lineup.\n\nTo get back to the postseason, the Friars must excel at using Cronenworth’s versatility to their advantage.",

You can see that the team believes in itself. They are strong going forward, very quick on the counter-attack. They also have players who score goals.

Only a few still need to integrate after their return. We know PSV’s qualities. We have confidence in our squad. We believe in those who will start tomorrow.”\n\nAs always, Kompany is keeping his personnel plans close to the vest, but did comment on a few players.\n\n“When we have so many games, I don’t decide who plays the day before. I’ll think about it tomorrow after I get up. I have 100% respect for PSV; I know it will be difficult. It’s not just about (potentially resting) Harry (Kane). The quality of the pressing also depends on energy – that was our problem against Augsburg. I have to consider whether it’s a question of quality or also one of energy – I’ll decide that tomorrow. I want to win, there’s no doubt about that,” said Kompany. “Sacha (Boey) hasn’t trained that much yet, but he’s finally recovered from this illness. He showed good signs in training today, he can help us for a few minutes. He won’t start yet, but it’s fortunate that he’s fit again. This comes at the right time for us.\n\n“We all agree that (Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies) are two good players. Unfortunately, there’s no ‘soft integration’ at this stage of the season; it’s a hard integration. Playing time is based on performance, that’s our piece of the puzzle. We’re close to having a complete squad at the most important time of the season. The important thing is that we have all our best players in February and March. Stani (Josip Stanišić) and (Konrad) Laimer will also be back by then.”\n\nAs for Wednesday, it sure seems like Kompany is planning on using his top, available players to ward off a hungry PSV Eindhoven squad.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "Davis Webb has interviewed for multiple head coaching jobs, but if he stays in Denver, the Broncos could promote him to offensive coordinator.",
    "fullText": "Denver Broncos offensive pass game coordinator and quarterbacks coach Davis Webb is quickly becoming one of the hottest names on the coaching market. Webb has interviewed for head coaching vacancies with the Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, and Arizona Cardinals. However, if he doesn't land one of those jobs, a promotion in Denver could be on the table.\n\nAs of 5 p.m., NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported that the Broncos have fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi, creating an immediate opening on the staff. With Webb already playing a key role in the offense and earning league-wide interest, he would appear to be a strong internal candidate to step into the offensive coordinator role.\n\nThe #Broncos fired OC Joe Lombardi, per me and @TomPelissero.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 27, 2026\n\nAny final decisions will have to be made once all head coaching positions are filled. It's safe to say that Webb will be in good hands this upcoming season, either as a head coach or the next offensive coordinator for the Broncos. He will then be better suited and one of the favorites to land a head coaching job next season if nothing comes of the Raiders, Browns, or Cardinals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ravens Wire: The Broncos could promote Davis Webb after Joe Lombardi's firing",

    "description": "The Golden Eagles return to Milwaukee for an I-94 rivalry game after a pair of extremely shaky road wins.",
    "fullText": "Full faith and credit to Marquette to locking down Butler in the closing moments last time out. Sure, letting a 19-0 second quarter run go to waste as they frittered away a 14 point lead at the start of the fourth quarter down to getting lucky after committing a five second violation and Lee Volker hitting a free throw with 16 seconds left to dodge a problem isn’t a fun way to go through life.\n\nBut Marquette was also going through that particular moment in life without Jada Bediako or Skylar Forbes available. It’s unclear as to what’s up with Bediako, although it was the second straight game that she was out and also not on the bench. In Forbes’ case, she didn’t travel with the team to Indianapolis for what was called “personal reasons” on the ESPN+ broadcast. On one hand, it wasn’t the best possible Marquette roster that head coach Cara Consuegra could have put on the floor for 40 minutes…. on the other hand, did I mention that 19-0 run and the 14 point lead? And that game came just days after Marquette gutted out a road win over St. John’s in the wake of giving up massive runs to Seton Hall and Georgetown in a pair of losses. So, y’know: Yay for getting the W…. but I’ve got questions, and so should you.\n\nWe’ll see exactly what’s up with Marquette and Bediako and Forbes when the availability report comes out on Wednesday afternoon. If they’re out again, it’s probably about time for Consuegra to start explaining exactly what’s going on. If they’re back in the lineup, then it’s all systems go and time for the Golden Eagles to stack up a third straight win heading into this weekend’s rematch with Georgetown.\n\nDate: Wednesday, January 28, 2026\nTime: 6:30pm Central\nLocation: Al McGuire Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nStreaming: ESPN+, with Bob Brainerd and Chloe Marotta calling the action\nLive Stats: Stat Broadcast\nBluesky Updates: @AnonymousEagle\n\nMarquette is 40-49 all time against DePaul. The Blue Demons have controlled the series 23-22 since the two teams have joined the Big East, but the Golden Eagles have won 10 of the last 11 and each of the last eight in a row after an 85-54 victory in Chicago back in December.\n\nI don’t think there’s anything particularly interesting to take away from Marquette’s first game against DePaul this season in terms of “how do the Golden Eagles approach a second meeting?” MU was up 7-0 and 18-5 during the first quarter before wrapping up the first 10 minutes up 23-9. The Golden Eagles won each of the remaining quarters by three, nine, and five points on their way to a 31 point victory and no one played more than 27 minutes. I guess the interesting statistical item is that Marquette wasn’t really knocking anyone’s socks off with 50.9% shooting overall and 38.9% from behind the three-point line. This wasn’t a game where Marquette couldn’t miss, it was more a game where DePaul couldn’t do anything but miss, so perhaps MU’s defensive effort against the Blue Demons is the interesting component there.\n\nIt will be a slightly different DePaul team this time around against Marquette. Aizhanique Mayo and Shakara McCline missed the first meeting, and they’ve been getting regular minutes for the Blue Demons as the squad has beaten Georgetown and Creighton in their last five games and at least made Seton Hall make sure they stayed down in an 86-77 loss. Not a lot, mind you, just enough to deepen DePaul’s rotation a little bit and lessen a little bit of the pressure on Katie Novik, the team’s leader in points, rebounds, and assists, and the only Blue Demon averaging in double digits at 12.1 points per game.\n\nThe biggest question for this game is whether or not Marquette comes ready to go. DePaul has the worst defense in the Big East in league action, both in terms of points per possession efficiency and shooting percentages. A locked in Marquette squad should be able to get quality shots and rip the Blue Demons’ defense apart. A not-quite-locked-in Marquette, one that let Butler wander back in from down 15 late in the third quarter and needed to make a free throw to avoid giving BU a shot to tie at the horn? That kind of Marquette is at risk of getting run over like Creighton did in DePaul’s 76-61 win last time out.\n\nFollow Anonymous Eagle on social media\n\nFacebook: AnonymousEagle\n Instagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle",

    "fullText": "Now nearly a full month into 2026, college basketball teams are into the thick of their conference schedules. UNC, which secured a huge road upset of rival Virginia on Saturday, is in the top half of what's shaping up to be a deep ACC.\n\nNorth Carolina (16-4, 4-3 ACC) rolled through non-conference play with a 12-1 record, securing wins against fellow blue bloods Kansas and Kentucky. The Tar Heels hit an impasse to begin ACC play, losing their first three conference road games, but squeaked by Wake Forest at home and dominated Notre Dame.\n\nUNC has plenty more season ahead, with a third-straight NCAA Tournament appearance increasingly likely. In USA TODAY Sports' January 26 bracketology, released earlier Tuesday, North Carolina is a 5-seed in the East Region.\n\nUSAT projects the Tar Heels facing 12-seeded Belmont in Tampa, Fla. Joining UNC and the Bruins are 4-seed, reigning national champion Florida and 2023 Final Four squad Florida Atlantic.\n\nNorth Carolina and Belmont, the latter a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, previously played in November 2013. If you attended that game at the Dean Dome, you likely still have memories of a painful upset etched in your mind.\n\nAfter dropping consecutive games at Stanford and Cal on their West Coast swing, the Tar Heels are now winners of two straight. Derek Dixon is a key in the starting lineup, Caleb Wilson remains a superstar and head coach Hubert Davis is now playing his best rotations.\n\nUNC has all the pieces to make a National Championship run. Can North Carolina continue to play at its current pace, rise through the ACC and be college basketball's last team standing in April?\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball projected the East's 5 seed in USAT Sports bracketology",

    "fullText": "Heading into the 2026 WWE Royal Rumble, multiple things are pointing to AJ Styles possibly losing to GUNTHER, then retiring from in-ring competition. The latest backing that outcome is a filing from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nFor weeks, the WWE Universe and WWE commentators have referred to GUNTHER as \"The Career Killer,\" given that he successfully put the careers of John Cena and WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg to rest in 2025. On Monday, filed to trademark \"Career Killer\" with the USPTO, potentially lending further credence to the scenario of GUNTHER defeating Styles at the Royal Rumble, where \"The Phenomenal One\" will put his career on the line.\n\nThis trademark application specifically aims to cover entertainment services related to professional wrestling, such as digital and broadcast media. As of this writing, the application is awaiting assignment to an examining attorney.\n\nSince GUNTHER bested Cena in his retirement match at the December 13 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Styles has demanded that \"The Career Killer\" show some respect to the legends that came before him in WWE, like Cena. Instead, GUNTHER has repeatedly shrugged off Styles' words and controversially beat him in a singles match on \"WWE Raw.\"\n\nAccording to fellow WWE star Shinsuke Nakamura, Styles previously disclosed to him that the 2026 Royal Rumble will indeed mark his retirement match. The social media post containing this information has since been deleted, suggesting that Nakamura may have accidently spoiled the result of GUNTHER vs. Styles. As always, though, WWE events are subject to change.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines. You can also add us as a preferred search source on Google.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos, two days after losing to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, have fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi. The move comes after the team posted a 14-3 season and nearly went to the Super Bowl.\n\nBut if you read between the lines, it seems that the Broncos might have a specific reason for making this decision and that involves another coach on their staff.\n\nQuarterbacks coach Davis Webb is suddenly a hot commodity around the league and is being considered for a head coaching job, despite being just 30 years old and never even being in a coordinator role. He interviewed with the Buffalo Bills, who hired Joe Brady as their new head coach on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Webb is being connected to the vacancy with the Las Vegas Raiders, something Sean Payton took a shot at on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, it seems that the Broncos are recognizing the interest in Webb, a former NFL player who is regarded by many in the league as a guaranteed future head coach, and could be making sure he doesn't go anywhere.\n\nIf Webb is a strong candidate for the Raiders job, it seems that the Broncos may have given him a choice between being a coordinator for a team that was one step away from the Super Bowl or taking over a team that hasn't won a playoff game in 23 years.\n\nMake no mistake, with Lombardi out, Webb is the clear frontrunner to become the new offensive coordinator for the Broncos. Should that happen, it brings another interesting question with it?\n\nWould Payton give up his play-calling duties?\n\nThat is something many Broncos fans have clamored for since Payton became the head coach, even with the team's success. Perhaps that would be one of Webb's bargaining chips. He could say that he'll turn down the Raiders job, if it's offered, if he is going to be allowed to be the Broncos' new play-caller in 2026.\n\nREAD:Broncos must do everything in their power to sign 27-TD free-agent running back\n\nThe firing of Lombardi, who has spent a total of 15 seasons working for Payton between the Broncos and New Orleans Saints, sets up some intriguing possibilities.\n\n6 honest takeaways from Broncos' devastating loss to Patriots in AFC Championship Game\n\nBroncos' Dre Greenlaw offers surprising insight following disappointing season\n\nBroncos will have huge decision to make at running back this offseason\n\nWhich Broncos players are set to become unrestricted free agents?\n\n4 Broncos players who may have just played their final game with team",

    "fullText": "(The Center Square) – The Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl run isn’t just a win for the team, but also a win for the Seattle economy, particularly for downtown bars, restaurants and hotels near Lumen Field.\n\nHowever, economic principles of fungibility suggest that the overall, long-term economic impact on the city may be exaggerated.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Seahawks' victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday – which advanced the team to Super Bowl LX against the New England Patriots on Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. – means a genuine, short-term economic boost to Seattle, especially the local hospitality industry.\n\nAccording to Visit Seattle, hosting National Football League playoff games – which the Seahawks did twice, being the top seed in the National Football Conference – provides a vital economic stimulus during the typically quiet winter season, with hotel occupancy often soaring more than 50% above typical January figures.\n\nThe Center Square reached out to several organizations about the Seahawks’ potential championship run and asked if a team making the Super Bowl brings localized, high-impact spending during the playoffs, noting the difference between a short-term economic boost and the more mixed long-term impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, I have absolutely no data to validate whether or not those claims may be true,” Patrick Connor, Washington state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, told The Center Square.\n\nJoey Thompson, public relations manager at Visit Seattle, had a similar take.\n\n“We won’t be able to provide any comment just yet, but we may be able to put together an estimated economic impact for hotels after the fact, when more data is available to us,” he said. “We’ll make sure to circle back!”\n\nDowntown Seattle Association President and CEO Jon Scholes said it will be a little while before any specific economic impact can be quantified.\n\n“The platform we use to measure economic impact of events has a lag time of 10-14 days, so we won’t have the NFC championship metrics for a while,” he explained.\n\nHe did point to a Tuesday morning Puget Sound Business Journal piece that includes a link to a 2025 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report with estimates of spending in the markets of last year’s Super Bowl participants, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n“For the hometowns of each team, the Chamber estimates the Kansas City metro area could see $123.3 million in spending on the big game, while the Philadelphia metro could see $346.8 million,” the report states.\n\nSeattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Joe Nguyen also referenced last year's Chamber of Commerce report and Tuesday's Puget Sound Business Journal story in touting the Seahawks' success translating into economic success for Seattle.\n\n\"Yes, this is true - a Seahawks Super Bowl appearance will likely deliver a real economic boost for Seattle! The U.S. Chamber of Commerce report from 2025 shows the Super Bowl drove hundreds of millions to more than $1 billion in spending nationwide, with increased demand for food, apparel, hospitality, and entertainment reaching cities like Seattle even when they aren’t hosting (Seattle's estimated benefit in 2025 was $224,636,077),\" he said in a statement to The Center Square.\n\n\"The Puget Sound Business Journal reports that Seattle retailers and restaurants are already seeing higher sales tied to the Seahawks playoff run, especially in merchandise and game-day traffic. Super Bowl Sunday will likely up that spending across Seattle’s retail and hospitality sectors, including in the next 12 days leading up to the game.”\n\nWhile Seattle is experiencing an economic surge during playoff games, this is most likely a temporary effect that won’t fundamentally transform the city's overall economy.\n\nWhile civic boosters and the National Football League often project high economic impact figures, research suggests the true benefit is often a fraction of those, according to researchers from North Caroline State University.\n\nThe university’s report, released earlier this month, argues that the Super Bowl's economic impact on host cities is often exaggerated, with benefits frequently falling short of promises while the NFL captures the majority of revenue. While the event drives immense commercial value, local, long-term economic gains are limited, while public costs for infrastructure and security are high.\n\nWhile the economic impact of the NFL playoffs in Seattle is often substantial, the fungibility of money suggests the total impact might be lower than advertised. Much of this spending is often diverted from other local entertainment rather than entirely new, outside money entering the economy.\n\nA Super Bowl run is about much more than money, Scholes acknowledged.\n\n“A Seahawks march to the Super Bowl just months after the Mariners made a postseason run helps generate a continued sense of optimism and community,” he said. “The civic pride extends beyond the playing field and has the potential to drive, on some level, a positive reputational jolt.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers may soon be looking for another goalie.\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs could be a good match for a potential trade.\n\nThat's the idea suggested in a new article for Daily Faceoff by Anthony Di Marco.\n\nHe suggests that the Flyers need to move on from Sam Ersson, who might be \"the league's worst goaltender,\" he writes.\n\n\"Speaking with a team source Tuesday morning, there doesn’t appear to be an imminent plan to replace Ersson in-season,\" Di Marco writes. \"After the season is a different story, as I’ve heard going back 24 months now that the 2026 off-season would give the Flyers clarity on their goaltending picture heading into the future.\"\n\nMORE: Why Craig Berube has a huge cut on his head\n\nSpecifically, Di Marco wonders if the Flyers could go after Toronto's Dennis Hildeby, who doesn't have a great path to time behind Joseph Wall and Anthony Stolarz.\n\n\"Woll and Stolarz are signed for two and four seasons beyond this year, respectively, and Hildeby is set to be waiver eligible starting next season with two years left on his current contract,\" Di Marco writes. \"The Leafs have some of their best goaltending depth in a long time considering Artur Akhtyamov has also established himself as a viable prospect in the AHL.\"\n\nDi Marco adds, \"Hildeby is someone I know the Flyers like.\"\n\nMORE: This save from Tristan Jarry makes no sense after he lost his skate blade\n\n\"Is he available? That much is uncertain, but he may be the Leafs’ best trade chip if they want to make an addition ahead of the trade deadline,\" Hildeby writes. \"With no first-round picks in each of the next two drafts and their top prospect, Easton Cowan, already on the roster, they don’t have much in the way of trade currency. Hildeby, if made available, could be just that. At the same time, the very thing that makes him valuable is a reason to keep him: he’s signed through 2027-28 at an $841,667 cap hit.\"\n\nThere are a lot of questions to be answered here, and it sounds more like an offseason deal if anything, but it's worth keeping an eye on for the Flyers.\n\nJason Robertson shows how big a mistake Team USA made\n\nEvgeni Malkin's future with the Penguins may have changed\n\nEvan Bouchard joins Bobby Orr in the history books\n\nElias Pettersson takes a bold trade stance\n\nMaple Leafs can trade for veteran who already likes playing in Toronto\n\nSenators warned about looming trade of $57.5 million star",

    "description": "The Eagles promised they'd cast a wide net, and that's what they have done. No one should be complaining.",
    "fullText": "Look, we get it. The most recent Philadelphia Eagles season was stressful. They lost games they had no business losing, and even when they won, it often seemed as though they were more lucky than deserving. We can still see Jordan Davis blocking a last-second field-goal attempt and running to paydirt to claim victory from what seemed like certain defeat.\n\nVic Fangio's defense was up to the task when they weren't victims of offensive inefficiency-induced exhaustion. Without Kevin Patullo's unit's support, they sometimes had to endure workdays longer than they expected.\n\nWe thought the offense would figure things out. They never did, and eventually all of their flaws caught up with them. Everything imploded with a loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the Wild Card Round, eventually leading to Patullo being shown the door.\n\nWe're nearly two weeks removed from the end-of-season press conference featuring Nick Sirianni and Howie Roseman, where both promised a wide-ranging search for the next offensive coordinator. So why the frustration now that they're doing exactly that?\n\nHere's where most can agree: when things are going well, this organization is praised as one of the NFL's best-run. This is a chance to reinforce that reputation, not abandon it. The search isn't over, yet hope has already given way to anxiety for some.\n\nThe truth is simple. No one knows whether this OC search will succeed or fail. Not yet. The Eagles know what they're looking for, and history suggests that when they're allowed to conduct a thorough process, they usually get it right.\n\nEveryone loved the Chip Kelly hire. Remember him? That was a rushed decision. Meanwhile, Andy Reid, Doug Pederson, Nick Sirianni, and Shane Steichen were all met with skepticism. Each worked out just fine.\n\nPatience isn't blind faith. It's trusting a process that has earned it. Yikes. Maybe we shouldn't say 'trust the process' in Philadelphia. You get the idea, though. Until proven otherwise, the Eagles deserve that much. There's no sense in doubting this organization now.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Eagles have earned the benefit of the doubt with OC search",

    "fullText": "A new era of Pittsburgh Steelers football began on Tuesday afternoon inside the PNC Champions Club at Acrisure Stadium.  62-year-old Greenfield native and Super Bowl XLV Champion Mike McCarthy is the 17th head coach in Steelers history.\n\nIntroduced alongside owner/president Art Rooney II and general manager Omar Khan, McCarthy introduced his plan for the Steelers in his attempt to win his childhood team its seventh Lombardi Trophy. After taking the floor and saying an emphatic “Here We Go” as he rubbed his hands back and forth, McCarthy couldn’t even begin his opening statement without getting emotional.\n\n“Oftentimes, coaches and players put on new team colors, and it takes a minute to feel comfortable in those new colors,” McCarthy said before pausing and getting emotional again. “But to be blessed beyond any measure, one day to put on the colors you wore… when you came home from Mercy Hospital.”\n\nAwesome seeing how choked up Mike McCarthy got talking about being from Pittsburgh pic.twitter.com/L20jGLxfaE\n\n— Austin Bechtold (@AustinRBechtold) January 27, 2026\n\nMcCarthy inherits a franchise that hasn’t won a playoff game since 2016 and has been running in place the past three years with 10-7 seasons resulting in lopsided losses in the wild card round.\n\nHe understands the weight of being the Steelers’ leader and the responsibility at hand to ensure this fresh start ends\n\n“I want to thank Art Rooney II, Omar Khan, Dan Rooney, and the entire Steelers organization for the trust they’ve placed in me to represent one of the most storied franchises in all of sports,” McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy replaces Mike Tomlin, who stepped down after a seventh consecutive playoff loss and a historic 19-year run leading the Steelers\n\n“I understand and embrace the responsibility, privilege, and the weight that comes with this stewardship,” McCarthy said.\n\nThe amount of pride in being from Pittsburgh is evident from your neighbor or community, to Pat McAfee and others on national TV, to Joe Manganiello and Billy Gardell in Hollywood. Pittsburgh people love where they’re from. McCarthy is one and the same as the rest of Pittsburgh natives.\n\n“This city, this franchise, this fan base means the world to me. Because Pittsburgh’s my world,” McCarthy said, tapping his chest. “It’s just awesome to be back here.”\n\nMcCarthy thanked friends Tomlin and Bill Cowher, whom he said represented the team with class, and he is honored to follow in their footsteps.\n\nHe thanked his family and said they can now proudly wear their Steelers swag and not hide the love they have for the team. But now the work begins to ensure the Steelers return to prominence.\n\n“My heart is full, my focus is singular, and it’s time to bring another championship back to this great city,” McCarthy said. “With that, I just want to make sure that when we do get that seventh trophy in the case, we’ll start that victory parade at 1137 Greenfield Ave.”",

    "title": "San Diegan Xander Schauffele makes a case for Torrey Pines having prominent spot on future PGA Tour schedule",
    "description": "Xander Schauffele thinks that his hometown of San Diego and the Torrey Pines golf courses likely will remain in a prominent place on the PGA Tour's schedule in the future",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — Xander Schauffele was born in a hospital in La Jolla that is 2½ miles from the clubhouse at the Torrey Pines golf municipal courses. He played high school and college golf atop the cliffs, built a dream home eight miles away and has competed in the Farmers Insurance Open in every season he’s been a pro, save last year when he was dealing with an injury.\n\nSo, yes, he’ll be the first to admit he’s biased when it comes to seeing Torrey Pines and San Diego remain on the PGA Tour schedule in perpetuity—at a time when there is so much speculation about which tournaments will remain and which will disappear when the Future Competitions Committee (FCC) makes it recommendations sometime in the next few months.\n\nOn Tuesday, ahead of Thursday’s start of the last San Diego tournament that will be sponsored by Farmers Insurance, Schauffele admitted that he’s hardly the guy tying himself to a Torrey pine tree to save the event. But he also doesn’t seem overly concerned that the tournament is in danger of going away.\n\n“I think I would feel like Torrey's safe if you kind of look at the schedule, just from it should find a home because this property's iconic,” said the 10-time tour winner. “It's a beautiful property, it's a big property, it's a tough golf course, and it usually has pretty good winners on it.”\n\nSchauffele then pointed out the impact that Tiger Woods has had on Torrey Pines, and vice versa. Woods, who happens to lead the FCC, won here eight times, including the epic 2008 U.S. Open, and in turn, people flock to the site from all over the world and television viewers can likely recall memorable holes and shots at Torrey as much as most venues on tour.\n\n“I think Tiger single-handedly has made this property incredibly special in terms of a history in golf, just tying back to the '08 U.S. Open,” said Schauffele, who on-site as a youngster and scrambling to see Woods’ incredible Sunday putt at 18 in ’08. “You look at pretty golf courses that we have on tour, I'd say Torrey's one of them. I wouldn't be shocked if it was somewhere on the schedule.\n\n“I couldn't answer when or who would want to be a sponsor or something of that nature, but I think it's a strong enough course and a big enough course, a championship course to be on the schedule still.”\n\nWith talk that the Hawaiian Swing’s season-opening tournaments on Maui and Oahu might go away permanently after this season, and with the San Diego event looking for a new sponsor, speculation turns to the remaining events on the West Coast Swing. Pebble Beach and Riviera already host signature events, leaving The American Express and San Diego as those tournaments \n\nThe Sentry, also a signature tournament and previously at Kapalua, seemingly would need a home, and The American Express is a three-course pro-am that wouldn’t appear conducive to hosting a limited field. That would seemingly leave Torrey Pines as a strong possible landing spot for The Sentry on the South Course. Tour officials are declining comment until the FCC delivers its report.\n\nFor Schauffele, with no Sentry at which to start the season, he skipped the first two events and begins at Torrey Pines, where, curiously, he has only two top-10 finishes in nine starts. He missed last year with a rib cage injury that ended up creating a sluggish start and middling play that led to him missing the Tour Championship for the first time.\n\nSchauffele called it a “bad year,” but it ended on a couple of very high notes. He and his wife, Maya, had their first child, a boy they named Victor, in late August, and in October, Schauffele shot 64 in the final round to win the Baycurrent Championship in Japan—the country in which his mother was raised.\n\nOf what it meant to get that season-ending win, Schauffele said, “We had a kid, and, obviously, I'm going to take advantage and spend as much time with him and my wife. It was a big goal of mine to play well. So, I just know myself—if I didn't play well in Japan, I would have been super pumped to be there and be present [with him family], obviously, but at the same time something would have been just scratching at the back of my head of just like, ‘you suck,’ you know what I mean? You've got to play a lot better.”",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS – Dan Ige is not surprised to draw Melquizael Costa next.\n\nIge (19-10 MMA, 11-9 UFC) takes on the rising featherweight Costa (25-7 MMA, 6-2 UFC) at UFC Fight Night 267 on Feb. 21 at Toyota Center in Houston.\n\nCosta, MMA Junkie's 2025 Under-the-Radar Fighter of the Year, had a banner year when scored four wins capped off with a head kick knockout of Morgan Charriere at at UFC on ESPN 73 in December.\n\n\"I had my eyes on him for a while,\" Ige told MMA Junkie of Costa. \"I think he's called me out a couple of times – and timing. Fights are all timing and who's available. He was definitely a guy on the radar and when they called me for the fight. It was like six weeks' notice. I've been training, I've been ready so, I was super pumped on the opportunity. I don't really care about rankings or anything right now. I'm just trying to get back in the win column, and go from there.\"\n\nIge has never been finished in his professional MMA career. Although he's lost three of his past four fights, he remains ranked in the UFC's featherweight division. However, Ige isn't focused on any of that. He can relate to Costa's rise, and won't allow him to make a name off him.\n\n\"He'll try, and I'll try and finish him,\" Ige said. \"It'll definitely be a great fight for the fans, but I think I got my number on him and he's been looking great. I think four (or) five-fight winning streak and coming off a head kick knockout. He's been very active (with) I think four fights last year, and I know what that's like to have to take fight after fight after fight, and I've been there. Six-fight win streak and just fight after fight, and they throw you to the wolves.

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos announced that they have fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi, wide receivers coach Keary Colbert, and cornerbacks coach Addison Lynch.\n\nWe’ve parted ways with three assistant coaches.\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) January 28, 2026\n\nSean Payton and the Broncos released a statement thanking all three coaches for their contributions to the team and wished them all the best in the future.\n\n“I want to thank these coaches for playing an important role in elevating our program over the last three seasons,” Payton said. “I’ve been fortunate to work with Joe Lombardi for 15 years and am particularly grateful for his many contributions to our success as offensive coordinator.\n\n“We sincerely appreciate Joe, Keary and Addison’s hard work and wish them all the best in the future.”\n\nThis comes as a bit of a surprise, as Lombardi has been one of Sean Payton’s most trusted coaches in recent seasons. Could this mean that the Broncos are making a play to keep offensive pass game coordinator/quarterbacks coach Davis Webb? He is a favorite for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job, so it’ll be interesting to see how that plays out.\n\nLombardi served as the Broncos’ offensive coordinator since the team hired Sean Payton back in 2023 and had previous experience with Payton during his time with the Saints. However, the Broncos’ struggles on offense, which Payton talked about today, may have contributed to this firing.\n\nEarlier today, during the end of the year press conference, Payton was asked about the struggling run game and told reporters that improving in that area is “one of the key things we have to do this offseason”.\n\n“Great question. I stepped into [Offensive Run Game Coordinator/Assistant Head Coach] Zach [Strief]’s office yesterday. I said look… There’s probably a series of answers to that. That what we’re doing… I feel like we’re far enough along with the RPOs and some of that but when we want to run it under center and control a game, we’ve been able to do it a few times, but not as much as I’d like. That’ll be an important study and with urgency, and then also with the runners, who are we asking… Losing [RB] J.K. [Dobbins], obviously, that was a tough loss. He brought a lot to the locker, more than you would know. But that’ll be one of the points of emphasis that I think that we research and look into heavily. I want to play from the gun, but I also will always want to play with a two-back or multiple tight end mindset [and] have that flexibility. It’s a good question. I think it’s one of the key things that we have to do this offseason.”\n\nThen he was asked about the drops that plagued the Broncos’ offense late this season and throughout the playoffs. He talked about how he likes his wide receiver room and how it has everything he wants at the position, but that there is a proper way to catch a football. He added they have to be better at teaching that this offseason.\n\n“Look, we drafted to it, and I like who we’ve drafted to it. Yes, there were too many [drops] even down the stretch. The thing with the draft, man, we’ve invested, and I like the players in that room. We’ve got different… We have speed, we have size, we have all the things I’m used to [and] you’d want to have in a good offense. But I think that there’s a proper way to catch a football, and most of the time, it’s with your thumbs together, not the other way around. The other way around, I’m serious, only exists when the ball is below your belly button. Even the deep balls should be caught with your thumbs together. So we have to be better at that.”\n\nNow, did I anticipate that this would lead to Lombardi’s firing? I did not, but it is interesting to see what changes Payton makes to his coaching staff.\n\nPass game coordinator/quarterbacks coach Davis Webb would be the logical in-house replacement, but he is in the running to be the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders. Regardless, the Broncos will have to interview at least two minority candidates to fulfill the Rooney Rule, so we will have to see which direction Payton and the team decides to go.",

    "fullText": "Seahawks projected $42 million dynamic playmaker predicted to leave Seattle for Broncos originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks traded for wide receiver Rashid Shaheed during the 2025 trade deadline, but the team will already have to make a decision on his future in the offseason.\n\nShaheed is set to enter free agency in the spring, and though Seattle could look to retain him, YardBarker's Seth Trachtman predicts the dynamic receiver will pack his bags and head to the Mile High to sign with the Denver Broncos.\n\nHere is what Trachtman said about Shaheed and his potential fit in Denver:\n\n\"Shaheed and Sean Payton didn't overlap in New Orleans, with Payton departing following the 2021 season and Shaheed signing out of the draft in 2022. Still, he's likely very familiar with the explosive wideout and kick returner, and Shaheed's skillset would be a perfect fit for a Broncos squad that needs more explosive weapons.\"\n\nShaheed hasn't had a very productive 2025 campaign, tallying 499 yards and two touchdowns in the regular season, including just 188 yards with Seattle.\n\nHowever, the 27-year-old has shown that he can be an explosive playmaker. Shaheed also provides production in the return game, two Pro Bowls, and a first-team All-Pro selection in 2023 for his work on special teams.\n\nIn the right offense, Shaheed could blossom into a star playmaker. The Broncos need to supply quarterback Bo Nix with more weapons, and Shaheed would immediately step in as a primary deep threat in Denver's offense.\n\nThe Broncos are slated to have $27 million in cap space this offseason. Spotrac projects Shaheed will land a deal worth $42.3 million over three seasons, which averages to $14.1 million annually.\n\nThough Shaheed may not be worth the price for some, the Broncos need receiving talent, and Shaheed still has promise with his game-breaking speed and big-play ability. General manager George Paton should look into signing the speedy receiver.\n\nNFL legend blasts Hall of Fame voters for egregious Bill Belichick snub\n\nPromising Broncos assistant predicted to leave Denver for Ravens' OC job\n\nBills head coach hire of Joe Brady is great news for Broncos, Rams, Titans\n\nColts, Cardinals, Vikings named top landing spots for $14 million veteran quarterback\n\nBills rumor from Adam Schefter pinpoints Broncos assistant as Buffalo's leading DC candidate\n\nRaiders predicted to hire Kyle Shanahan disciple as next head coach",

Together, we’re proud to uplift and empower the people and organizations that make Los Angeles thrive.”\n\nThe annual community service week essentially sets things in motion for the organization each year as the Dodgers Love L.A. Community Tour leads into DodgerFest with spring training to follow.\n\nLOS ANGELES — The back-to-back World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers will stage their annual community service week – Dodgers Love L.A. Community Tour presented by Bank of America – beginning this Monday, January 26 through Friday, January 30.\n\nThe 2026 tour will feature 11 different stops over five days, highlighting the team’s special relationship with its fans and community neighbors in the city.\n\n“We are honored to continue our partnership with Bank of America for our annual Dodgers Love L.A.

On the Dodgers Love L.A. tour in January 2016, Dodger legend Andre Ethier and Hall of Famer Tommy Lasorda had an impactful lunch with victims and first responders from the 2015 terrorist attack. Later on Wednesday, Ashley will take the World Series trophy over to the City of Los Angeles Emergency Management Department (EMD) in recognition of its continued dedication and service to our communities. Employees will have the opportunity to take photos with the trophy, meet and interact with Ashley, and enjoy a moment of appreciation and celebration during their workday.\n\nOn Thursday, two-time Cy Young award winner Blake Snell and Landon Knack will join both Dodger and Bank of America staffers at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach. Students from the 75th St. Elementary school will take part in an educational field trip and have lunch with the Dodger left-hander. Thursday concludes with a special “Senior Prom” for local senior citizens at the nearby Glendale Recreation Center. Dodger players Jack Dreyer, Will Klein, Dalton Rushing and River Ryan will be on hand for the festivities.\n\nThe Dodgers Love L.A. Community Tour wraps up on Friday with a very special pep rally at El Rancho High School in Pico Rivera. Current Dodger players Alex Call, Jack Dreyer, Brusdar Graterol, Landon Knack, Bobby Miller, Miguel Rojas, Tanner Scott, Brock Stewart and Gavin Stone will participate in interactive rally games and student engagement activities. Following the pep rally, the same Dodgers will then visit Frank Hotchkin Memorial Training Center right next to Dodger Stadium. The Boys in Blue will bring along the World Series trophy and salute local firefighters in recognition of the one-year anniversary of the devastating fires in Altadena and the Palisades last year.\n\nFinally, Graterol and Snell will finish out the tour by surprising and delighting customers at a local Jack in the Box.

    "fullText": "“Thug Rose” is going under the knife.\n\nFormer two-time Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Strawweight champion Rose Namajunas saw her title hopes at a second weight class come to a screeching halt this past weekend (Sat., Jan. 24, 2026), dropping a close unanimous decision to No. 1 Flyweight contender Natalia Silva at UFC 324 inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAs if the loss itself wasn’t brutal enough, Namajunas revealed she’s now facing a lengthy recovery after suffering a serious eye injury during the fight. Earlier today, the 33-year-old shared on Instagram that she was scheduled to undergo canalicular tube surgery — a procedure to repair a torn tear-duct system caused by repeated eye pokes.\n\n“Alright, guys, I’m headed into surgery,” Namajunas said on Instagram today. “Canalicular tube surgery. I got poked in the eye a few times in the fight, so yeah. But my tube is torn so it’s going to be repaired right now. I’m going to have a silicone tube in my eye. Three months, so pray for me, guys. Just glad we can get it fixed.”\n\nCanalicular tube surgery is no small matter. The procedure repairs a torn tear drainage canal in the inner corner of the eyelid — an injury that can cause constant watering, irritation, and vision issues if left untreated. An oculoplastic surgeon reconnects the damaged tissue and inserts a small silicone stent to keep the duct open while it heals. The stent typically remains in place for three to six months before being removed in-office.\n\nThe stent stays in for 3–6 months before easy removal in the office. When done soon after injury, it usually restores normal tear drainage successfully, though fighters face temporary discomfort and limited training during recovery.\n\nAccording to Ariel Helwani, Namajunas also won’t be able to sneeze or blow her nose for the next three months — an uncomfortable but necessary precaution during recovery. Yikes.\n\nThe timing couldn’t be worse for Namajunas, who reportedly had a guaranteed title shot against Flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko lined up with a win over Silva. Instead, she’ll be sidelined and forced to rebuild yet again in a crowded division.\n\nNamajunas is now 1–2 in her last three fights and sits at 3–3 since moving up to Flyweight. While her championship dreams aren’t officially dead, the road back just got significantly longer — and more painful.\n\nFor more UFC 324: “Gaethje vs. Pimblett” news and notes be sure to hit up our comprehensive event archive right here.",

    "fullText": "Independiente Santa Fe continues to add young talent to its sports project for the 2026 season. In recent hours, it was confirmed that Kilian Toscano, a 21-year-old midfielder, will join the \"Cardenal\" squad after reaching a loan agreement with Atlético Nacional. The young player, who is looking to establish himself in the capital, arrives with the mission of bringing balance and dynamism to the midfield of the team led by Pablo Peirano.\n\nDespite his young age, Toscano is no rookie in professional football. The midfielder already boasts 39 official matches, the vast majority of them wearing the verdolaga jersey, where he demonstrated his abilities in ball recovery and initiating play. Additionally, his talent led him to participate in several processes with the Colombia U-20 National Team during the Argentina 2023 World Cup cycle, although he ultimately was not included in the final squad for the global event.\n\nThis move represents the first change of scenery for Toscano, who completed his entire youth development in Medellín. For Santa Fe, the addition of the young player responds to the need to refresh the squad with promising players who are already familiar with the demands of big clubs. The footballer is expected to join training at the Tenjo facility immediately to compete for a spot in the starting eleven before the league begins.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

Due to Franco Armani’s inflamed heel, the young Santiago Beltrán will stay between the posts. In defense, Matías Viña will continue as left back, as Marcos Acuña will be rested. The midfield will be led by the balance of Aníbal Moreno and Fausto Vera, while in attack, Sebastián Driussi and Facundo Colidio will be the main goal threats.\n\nThe match will have a special emotional charge: the return of Nacho Fernández to the Monumental, this time as captain and leader of Gimnasia.

    "description": "Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" is being turned into an Amazon series. Producer Michael B. Jordan recently assured fans that the show is on its way.",
    "fullText": "At this point, it's hard not to be familiar with Rebecca Yarros' \"Empyrean\" series about dragon rider Violet Sorrengail.\n\nWhen \"Onyx Storm,\" the third book in the romantasy series, was released in January 2025, it became the fastest-selling adult novel in 20 years.\n\nYarros is taking a break from the \"Empyrean\" series before writing the fourth installment, but in the meantime, we're getting closer to a series adaptation of \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nIn October 2023, Deadline announced that Amazon MGM Studios and Oscar nominee Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society were developing \"Fourth Wing\" into a Prime Video series. Yarros is an executive producer for the show.\n\nOutlier Society produced Jordan's \"Creed III\" and is developing a slate of other series and films in addition to \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nDeadline also reported in October 2023 that Amazon MGM Studios had acquired the rights to the entire \"Empyrean\" series. In her January 2025 Variety interview, Yarros said she had shared the \"five-book arc\" for the \"Empyrean\" series with Amazon.\n\n\"They have the five-book arc, which went a little awry in Book 3 just because the positioning, but they already know that,\" she told Variety. \"But they have the five-book arc and the general big points of what happens in between each book, but they don't have the specifics between Book 4 and Book 5, because I'm getting ready to go to my crazy plotting board and and plot out every single event that happens in each book, so that I make sure that I'm within my two books there.\"\n\nIn July 2024, Outlier Society announced it had hired Moira Walley-Beckett, who worked on shows like \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Anne with an E,\" as the showrunner for the series. In a January 2025 interview with Variety, Yarros said Walley-Beckett was \"great\" and \"phenomenal,\" but in July 2025, Walley-Beckett exited the project.\n\nJac Schaeffer, best known for her work on Disney's \"WandaVision\" and \"Agatha All Along,\" was rumored to be in talks to step into the showrunner role. However, in September 2025, Variety and Deadline reported that Amazon was hiring Meredith Averill.\n\nAverill was previously the showrunner of the Netflix series \"Locke & Key\" and a producer on shows like \"The Good Wife\" and \"The Haunting of Hill House.\"\n\nAmazon declined to comment on this piece when contacted by Business Insider, but Yarros shared a screenshot of Deadline's article on her Instagram when the showrunner announcement dropped.\n\n\"Welcome to the team, Meredith Averill! Guys, I love everything this wonderful woman has worked on and I'm so excited to have her joining us,\" Yarros said in her caption.\n\nNeither Amazon nor Outlier Society has announced any casting or release dates for the series. Still, in January 2026, Jordan assured fans it was on its way in an interview with Deadline.\n\n\"We are making sure that this is going to be an exciting show that delivers on all of the things the fans want and some of the things that they won't be expecting either,\" Jordan said.\n\nHe also told the outlet he's aware of how much fans of \"Fourth Wing\" care about the series.\n\n\"But trust me, I know how beloved this franchise IP is,\" he said. \"It's early stages, but I feel how much people care about this one. It's not lost on us.\"\n\nAlthough details about the series are limited, Yarros made a few comments about the show while promoting \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nSpeaking at an engagement on January 24, 2025, in New York, Yarros told fans she had read the pilot for the \"Fourth Wing\" show — and loved it.\n\n\"I read the latest version of the pilot last week,\" she said. \"It's really nerve-racking when you read something like that because you're really — you're trusting someone else with your baby, right? And you're trusting someone else to say, like, 'Hey, this is important in your work, and this isn't,' and you kinda get your guard up.\"\n\n\"But guys, I, like, kicked my feet the whole time,\" she said. \"You're gonna love it.\"\n\nYarros also praised Walley-Beckett at the event, calling her a \"brilliant writer\" and saying she maintained the integrity of the book in the pilot. It's unclear how the pilot may have changed since Walley-Beckett's exit from the project.\n\nSpeaking at an event in London on August 30, 2024, Yarros said casting will ultimately fall on the show's staff, not her. She also said she intentionally hasn't shared any specific actors she hopes will be cast in the series.\n\n\"I will never say who my perfect fan cast is because the cast is so diverse, and I want to open that up to more diversity,\" she said. \"And I feel like the second I say who I think this character is, that's who everyone will accept. That's only who they will accept.\"\n\n\"I kinda hope they find, like, an up-and-coming generation,\" she added. \"But I would never put my fan cast in your heads.\"\n\nAlthough she won't be involved in casting the series, Yarros said at the same event that she has one hard-line casting request she has communicated to Amazon and Outlier Society.\n\n\"They know how staunch I am against whitewashing Xaden,\" she said. \"I think that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nXaden Riorson, Violet's love interest in the series, is described as having \"warm tawny skin\" in \"Fourth Wing\" and \"tawny-brown\" skin in both \"Iron Flame\" and \"Onyx Storm.\"",

    "fullText": "Health-insurance stocks plunged on Tuesday amid the latest updates from the White House on Medicare plan payments for next year.\n\nMajor insurers saw their stocks tumble sharply after the Trump administration proposed holding Medicare payments roughly flat in 2027. The small-than-expected increase comes amid concerns about rising health costs.\n\nHere were the big movers in Tuesday's session:\n\nUnitedHealth Group released fourth-quarter earnings before Tuesday's opening bell, with RBC analysts saying the earnings print and 2026 outlook were both \"solid.\" They chalked up the big slide in the shares to the latest insurance updates from the administration.\n\nDuring the earnings call, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel called the CMS proposal \"disappointing,\" saying if finalized, \"it will mean very meaningful benefit reductions.\"\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed a net average year-over-year payment increase of 0.09% in 2027 for Medicare Advantage members. In comparison, Medicare Advantage payments in 2026 rose 5.06% from 2025.\n\nThe proposed payment increase was well below Wall Street's expectations, with RBC Capital Markets analysts expecting an \"at least a mid-single digit increase.\" The analysts noted that historically, the final payment rate is higher than the initial proposal.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, CMS administrator, said the \"proposed payment policies are about making sure Medicare Advantage works better for the people it serves,\" while \"protecting taxpayers from unnecessary spending that is not oriented towards addressing real health needs.\"\n\nThe CMS proposal also includes updates to the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model, such as excluding diagnosis information not associated with a specific beneficiary encounter.",

    "description": "Former high-end real estate brokers Tal and Oren, plus Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, face up to life behind bars if convicted.",
    "fullText": "Former top ultra-luxury real estate broker brothers Oren and Tal Alexander, along with a third sibling, are sexual predators who together raped dozens of women and girls and then \"celebrated their crimes,\" a federal prosecutor told jurors on Tuesday.\n\nOver more than a decade, Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, \"used whatever means necessary\" — including drugging victims and using \"brute force\" — to carry out the attacks, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser said in her opening statement at the brothers' Manhattan sex-trafficking trial.\n\nThe Alexander brothers face a dozen felony counts, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and the sexual exploitation of a minor. They have vehemently denied the sex crimes charges against them, as well as all other allegations.\n\nIf convicted at trial, Tal Alexander, 39, and the twins, 38, could face up to life behind bars. It would mark a dramatic fall for the real estate agent brothers who built their careers on high-end luxury deals with notable clients, including Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, financier Leon Black, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nSmyser told the six-man, six-woman jury on Tuesday, that the Alexanders used \"power, wealth, and access to lure women and girls to them\" at swanky locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\n\"They physically held victims down\" and put drugs like GHB and Xanax in their drinks, getting the women so intoxicated that, in one instance, their victim could not stand up, Smyser said.\n\n\"You'll hear from a woman who Tal held down, while Alon and two others raped that woman,\" said Smyser said, adding that the woman was 16 years old at the time.\n\n\"You will also learn that the defendants celebrated their crimes,\" said the prosecutor. \"For example, after Oren and Alon sexually assaulted three high school girls in a hotel room, Oren texted a friend that he took down a 17-year-old.\"\n\nThe brothers told each other in text messages that \"the only thing that could bring them down is if some 'hoe' complained,\" Smyser told the jurors.\n\nAn accuser using the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" was the first government witness to testify on Tuesday. She broke down in tears as she told the jury she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012 when she was 20 years old.\n\nMoore said that she woke up naked with Alon Alexander standing over her, also naked, at the Manhattan apartment he shared with Tal Alexander, in the hours after an NBA Finals viewing party at the nearby penthouse of actor Zac Efron.\n\nShe described screaming \"no\" as she said she was assaulted.\n\nDefense attorneys for the brothers painted a starkly different portrayal of the sibling trio for the jury, saying that the Alexanders led a party-fueled lifestyle that involved lots and lots of consensual sex.\n\nThe brothers may be \"arrogant\" \"womanizers,\" but they are no sex traffickers, the lawyers said in their remarks, alleging that the accusers in the case are out for money.\n\n\"This case is about shame, opportunity, and money,\" Oren Alexander's attorney, Teny Geragos — who represented Sean \"Diddy\" Combs at his sex-trafficking trial last year — said in her opening statement.\n\nThe Alexanders, each wearing a suit jacket with a white dress shirt, listened intently while lawyers for Oren and Tal Alexander delivered separate opening statements, sometimes leaning forward in their seats at the defense table.\n\nGeragos described the Alexanders as successful and ambitious \"single men who liked to pursue women, at nightclubs, at bars, at restaurants, on apps — in other words, everywhere that single men in their 20s and 30s pursued women.\"\n\nThe women were attracted to the brothers and their lifestyle, and the brothers engaged in consensual sex with women who typically and amicably stayed in touch with them, she said.\n\nOren and Tal Alexander began their real estate careers at Douglas Elliman before launching their own brokerage, Official, in 2022. Alon Alexander was an executive at his family's private security firm.\n\n\"Remember, two things can be true at the same time,\" Gergaos told the jury. \"You may not approve of his lifestyle, but you can still find him not guilty of sex trafficking.\"\n\nGergaos argued that the Alexanders' accusers took drugs voluntarily and that no toxicology reports back up their accounts.\n\n\"Many of the accusers were ashamed after they had a one-night stand with one or more of the brothers,\" she said.\n\nTal Alexander's defense attorney, Deanna Paul, told the jury that the brothers were \"party boys\" and \"womanizers\" in their early 20s — but that this is not a crime.\n\n\"They slept with many, many women,\" Paul said, adding that the way the siblings talked about their sexual encounters was \"crude\" and \"arrogant,\" but it wasn't sex trafficking.\n\nThere was no \"commercial sex operation\" and no evidence that anyone was drugged involuntarily, Paul said. \"There are no contemporaneous reports to law enforcement,\" she added.\n\nThe judge overseeing the brothers' trial, US District Judge Valerie Caproni, has said that the trial is expected to last about a month, running through the end of February.",

    "description": "Analysts are laser-focused on Meta's AI ambitions and its surging capex spending. The company reports Q4 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech earnings are about to kick off in earnest, with Meta Platforms due to report results for the final quarter of 2025 on Wednesday.\n\nMeta stock has been highly volatile over the past year, remaining in the green but lagging behind some of its Magnificent Seven peers. The stock is up about 1% year-to-date and up 7% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe social media giant spent 2025 telling investors it would boost capex spending, hyping up its ambitious AI plans. Investors eventually balked at Meta and other tech titans' plans to keep increasing capex. Meta tumbled after its Q3 report, partly on its announcement that it plans to spend more than ever on AI infrastructure going forward.\n\nMeta latest announced it would significantly scale back its metaverse spending, touted by CEO Mark Zuckerberg as the company's future only a few years earlier.\n\nWall Street is estimating that the Facebook parent will report $58.4 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $8.19.\n\nHere's what analysts say they'll be listening for.\n\nBofA analysts expect Meta to slightly beat estimates, though they remain focused on the company's expense guide for the coming year. The bank has an $810 price target and a buy rating for the stock, implying 21% upside.\n\n\"Concerns on '26 expenses have been building for 5 months & we think an expense guide at around 30% 2026 growth could be positive, while at/above 35% a negative,\" said analyst Justin Post.\n\nHe added that his team expects Meta's capex spending to come in between $109 and $114 billion for the year, likely above Wall Street consensus of $110 billion.\n\nDeutsche analysts maintain a buy rating and a bullish price target of $880 for Meta stock, a 31% jump from current levels. But as analyst Benjamin Black notes, heading into the Q4 earnings call, concerns linger about this year's expenses.\n\nThat said, his team also predicts that Meta's revenue will come in at $59 billion, just above Wall Street estimates.\n\n\"In our view, Meta is positioned favorably — especially in the long-term — as it doubles down on an AI investment cycle,\" Black said.\n\nLike its peers, Goldman analysts remain focused on Meta's capex plans, which they believe will continue to drive growth into 2026 and beyond. The bank recently raised its spending projections for the company, already above analyst estimates, noting that it sees upward pressure on consensus capex estimates.\n\n\"On the next earnings call, we expect investors will be focused on any updates on the work of the Meta Superintelligence Lab, the timing of any foundational model work and/or any strategies with respect to consumer or enterprise utility around AI,\" Goldman analysts stated.\n\nRothschild has a $900 price target for Meta stock, one of the highest on Wall Street. Its target represents a 34% increase from levels on Tuesday. Analyst James Cordwell sees Meta as one of the tech sector's best-positioned companies to capitalize on rising AI demand.\n\n\"The recent focus regarding Meta has been dominated by how the company might guide for FY26 operating expenses and capital expenditure,\" he stated. \"The fear is that this is 'Zuckerberg unleashed', with the company's CEO truly back in 'founder mode', pursuing his AI dreams whatever the financial cost.\"\n\nThe analyst added that this has prompted Rothschild to increase its full-year capex projection for Meta to $117.1 billion.\n\nTD Cowen is bullish on Meta ahead of its Wednesday earnings report, predicting generative AI tools will continue to support growth in its advertising business.\n\nAnalyst John Blackedge said he believes ad growth will help bolster its high capex spending.\n\n\"Key at the 4Q25 print will be mgmt's '26 capex and opex guides,\" he said. \"We currently expect '26 capex of $125.0BN, up 76% y/y and 14% above consensus alongside '26 opex of $156.1BN, up 32.9% y/y and 7% above consensus.\"",

    "fullText": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is ordering state agencies and public universities in Texas to halt H-1B hiring, the latest setback for foreign workers looking to work in the US.\n\nIn a letter to Texas state agency heads on Tuesday, Abbott wrote that there had been \"recent reports of abuse\" in the H-1B visa program, which is designed to bring high-skilled foreign workers to the US.\n\n\"Texas taxpayers invest billions to train our workforce,\" Abbott wrote on X. \"Those jobs should go to Texans.\"\n\nAbbott is also directing agencies and universities to provide information on how many petitions they submitted in 2025, how many visa holders they currently sponsor, their countries of origin, and more.\n\nThe freeze is set to last through May 2027, and includes exceptions for instances in which written permission from the Texas Workforce Commission is given.\n\n\"Rather than serving its intended purpose of attracting the best and brightest individuals from around the world to our nation to fill truly specialized and unmet labor needs, the program has too often been used to fill jobs that otherwise could—and should— have been filled by Texans,\" Abbott wrote.\n\nTexas has the second-most H-1B visa holders, trailing only California.\n\nAs of 2025, more than 40,000 beneficiaries were approved to work for more than 6,100 employers, according to data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nAccording to that data, at least 1,200 H-1B visa holders work at various public universities in the state, including the University of Texas system, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech, and others.\n\nThe top employers for H-1B visa holders in Texas are IT companies and tech firms, including Oracle and Tesla.\n\nThe governor's directive comes as President Donald Trump's administration has upended the H-1B visa program more broadly.\n\nIn September, Trump moved to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, initially causing chaos at some major tech companies amid confusion over whether that fee applies to current employees who leave the country.\n\nThe administration rolled out social media screening requirements for visa holders in December, leading some firms to warn their employees against traveling outside the country.\n\nH-1B visas have proven to be a divisive issue within Trump's coalition, with some — most notably Elon Musk — arguing that the US must continue to bring in foreign talent to remain globally competitive.\n\nProminent business leaders who previously worked in the US under an H-1B visa include Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal, and Jeffrey Skoll, the first president of eBay.",

statuette or two — but there are actually quite a few iconic artists who seem to narrowly lose out year after year.\n\nHere are 21 artists who've never won a Grammy, ranked by how many nominations they've received.\n\nNominated 17 times since the 1990s, singer-songwriter Brian McKnight has yet to win his first Grammy.\n\nHe lost his last nomination for best male R&B vocal performance to Prince at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards, which were held in 2005.\n\nAt 16 nominations, the rapper only trails McKnight by one, but the two have even \n\nCalvin Broadus, better known as Snoop Dogg, also received his first nod in the early 1990s and, like McKnight, is still awaiting his first Grammy win.\n\nThe Icelandic singer, songwriter, actor, record producer, and DJ has been nominated 16 times across the past few decades, but Björk has never brought home a Grammy.\n\nShe was most recently nominated for best alternative music album at the 65th Annual Grammys.\n\nHis first nominations were for the hit \"Every Mile A Memory\" at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007.\n\nHowever, even after 15 nominations, country singer Dierks Bentley hasn't won.\n\nShe's racked up 14 nominations over

    "title": "Bari Weiss fielded tough questions from CBS News staffers about political bias and the network's future at a town hall",
    "description": "Bari Weiss was grilled by CBS News staffers in an all-hands meeting and said she's not \"a mouthpiece for anybody\" when asked about political bias.",
    "fullText": "CBS News employees put top editor Bari Weiss in the hot seat during an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, asking about her vision and standards for the nearly century-old broadcast network.\n\nThe first question in the Q&A part of her town hall asked how she would respond to criticism that CBS News is turning into \"a right-wing network\" under her leadership.\n\n\"I'm here to do one thing. It's not to be a mouthpiece for anybody. It's simply to be a mouthpiece for fairness and the pursuit of truth,\" Weiss said at the all-hands meeting, according to a recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nWeiss, who became the editor in chief of CBS News in October after Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison bought her opinion site The Free Press, asked staffers to examine the coverage since her appointment.\n\n\"There's a lot of noise out there, but I would just urge anyone who suggests that to look at our work and judge for yourself,\" she said.\n\nWeiss was then asked how the network's news-gathering standards had changed since she took over.\n\n\"I don't think our standards have changed,\" she said, adding that the network was \"in very capable hands\" regarding editorial standards.\n\nWeiss caused a stir in December for a late-hour decision to delay a \"60 Minutes\" segment about the Trump administration deporting migrants to the CECOT prison in El Salvador. Critics questioned her commitment to hard-hitting journalism and wondered whether Paramount leadership was influencing editorial decisions at CBS News — a notion that Weiss strongly denied on Tuesday.\n\n\"I want to just say this as plainly and clearly as possible. I was not pressured by David Ellison or anyone else,\" Weiss said during the town hall. Weiss acknowledged that it was bad timing to delay the segment after commercials promoting it had already aired.\n\n\"I didn't know the screening schedule for every single thing, that specific logistical nightmare,\" she said. \"That's never going to happen again. So please rest assured that nothing of that kind is ever going to happen again. You have my promise.\"\n\nThat said, she added that \"asking \n\n\"I felt it was important to do our best to try and get a voice from the administration, and I'm always going to be pushing for that,\" Weiss said.\n\nWeiss had little experience in traditional TV before joining CBS News. Instead, she became known in 2020 for her dramatic exit from The New York Times, during which she alleged anti-conservative bias. Her next move, starting The Free Press, turned out to be lucrative when Ellison bought it for $150 million in October.\n\n\"Loving America is not about jingoism. It's not about blind patriotism,\" Weiss told employees. \"It's about vociferous defense of the principles and values that have made this country exceptional and that allow us to do the work that we do. And so anyone that disagrees with that, I'd love to have a conversation with you.\"\n\nWhen asked whether \"CBS Mornings\" would undergo another shake-up, Weiss noted that it had already undergone a major change, with longtime anchor Tony Dokoupil moving to the evening show.\n\n\"Speculation about Gayle King seems to be a favorite parlor game of a lot of newspapers and people in this building, and I just want everyone here to know that she's absolutely beloved and see her long into the future here at CBS,\" Weiss said.\n\nIn prepared remarks, Weiss said that CBS News needed to \"shift to a streaming mentality immediately\" and that if the broadcast network stuck mainly to its linear TV strategy, \"we're toast.\"\n\nWhen asked about staffing or potential layoffs at CBS News, Weiss said that she couldn't make any promises amid a \"tsunami of technological change.\"\n\n\"I can't stand up here and tell you that in a moment of incredible transformation that that's not going to mean transformation of our workforce,\" Weiss said. She added that CBS News is \"also hiring people to suit that.\"\n\nWeiss said that if she didn't believe digital revenue could eventually replace linear TV revenue, she \"wouldn't be standing here.\" She said that linear TV wouldn't go away, but that revenue would \"decline sharply, as will the audience.\"\n\n\"What winning looks like writ large for this company is building incredible journalism for audiences that are so much bigger than the one that we currently have and are maintaining on linear,\" Weiss said. \"That's what winning looks like. It's really simple.\"\n\nHave a tip or thoughts on Bari Weiss' strategy for CBS News? Contact this reporter via email at jfaris@businessinsider.com or Signal at @jamesfaris.01.

And I just don't want any of us to lose sight of who we are and the job that we do here.\"\n\nKing said that many of Weiss' critics hadn't taken the time to hear where she's coming from.\n\n\"They've never even heard your frigging voice,\" King said. \"So it's good for them to see you are a real person and this is what you want and how you feel about us and how you feel about this job.\"\n\nDuring the same town hall, Weiss addressed speculation about King's future, telling staffers that the TV personality is \"absolutely beloved\" and that she sees King staying at CBS \"long into the future.\"\n\nKing also took those rumors about her next stop head-on.\n\n\"I'm so proud to work at this company,\" King said. \"I'm one of the people that had been in the news, too. I read the shit, and I go, 'I don't even know where that's coming from.'\"\n\nLastly, King addressed \"the leakers in the building\" at CBS News who've been sharing memos and recordings.\n\n\"I would like to think that we can have conversations and that we could talk candidly with each other, and it's not going to frigging be in the paper,\" King said to applause. \"I'm so sick of that.

    "description": "Andrew Volk owns a restaurant in Portland, Maine. The city has seen an increased ICE presence, and he says it's already dampening the local business.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew M Volk, owner of Hunt & Alpine in Portland, Maine. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn mid-January, I gathered my staff of 10 for a training session on what to do if ICE agents showed up at my restaurant. It came after days of hearing how concerned the team was following news of an increased presence of ICE agents in Portland.\n\nThis is not the kind of information we, as restaurant workers, are accustomed to needing to know and relay. This is all so new. We're entering the unknown. And people are scared of the unknown.\n\nMy staff is scared. I'm scared.\n\nI personally know people, and have heard of many more, staying home because they are afraid of being harassed or picked up by ICE. I'm acquainted with people who have been taken, and I don't know where they are right now.\n\nMy two children have said there are dozens and dozens of kids in their school not showing up because their parents are afraid for their safety.\n\nEveryone has been holding their breath to see what happens next.\n\nMy restaurant is only two blocks from City Hall in downtown Portland. Scattered around our streets, I know there are ICE agents — they are there in plain sight — and it was understandable that my staff were worried about what to do if they knocked on our door. I had to support my staff by giving them some information and direction regarding what to do if one of the ICE agents showed up.\n\nWe learned agents can enter the restaurant, but they aren't entitled to go into private or locked areas without a judicial warrant (we had to define what this warrant is). We don't have to answer questions from agents, and we're allowed to record their actions and words.\n\nI want my staff to know that, although the presence of these agents feels unpredictable, I'm in this with them. We're in it together. I want to be able to talk about what we can control and understand as much information as possible in preparation.\n\nAlthough I can't fix this situation, I can communicate with the people around me to ensure they know I will support them and I will support their communities.\n\nI've owned my restaurant for 12 years. I'm white. I'm a heterosexual man. I don't present as someone who ICE might come after right now, so I want to use my voice in ways others are frightened to.\n\nI haven't had to close my restaurant's doors yet, but I know several restaurant owners who have had to do so on certain days because so many of their staff were too scared to show up to work. These are people who are legally allowed to be in the United States. These are people with no criminal history. And they are petrified to go to work.\n\nThis is going to dampen our local businesses if ICE agents remain in Portland. It already has.\n\nEditor's note: Business Insider reached out to ICE and CBP for comment.",

    "fullText": "Don't expect to see Sam Altman lamenting the absence of \"masculine energy\" in corporate America to Joe Rogan anytime soon.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO sent employees a message on Slack criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement — and appears to have taken the opportunity to also take a subtle jab at his rival, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe reference can be found where Altman wrote that OpenAI aims to \"not get blown around by changing fashions.\"\n\n\"We didn't start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular,\" Altman told employees.\n\nLast year, Zuckerberg championed a return to masculinity at Meta on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\"\n\n\"The masculine energy, I think, is good,\" Zuckerberg said in the January podcast episode. \"Society has plenty of that, but I think corporate culture was trying to get away from it.\"\n\nZuckerberg described the merits of a corporate culture that \"celebrates the aggression\" of business.\n\nThe Meta CEO said that the intent of corporate culture's shift away from masculinity was good. Women likely feel that companies are \"too masculine,\" he told Rogan, and that things are \"biased\" against them. But the shift had gone too far, the Facebook cofounder said.\n\n\"It's one thing to say we want to be welcoming and make a good environment for everyone,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It's another to basically say that masculinity is bad.\"\n\nAltman also wrote in his memo that OpenAI didn't \"become super woke when that was popular.\"\n\nMeta didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Altman's remark.\n\nAltman and Zuckerberg are currently engaged in a talent war for top AI researchers and engineers.\n\nZuckerberg has attempted to poach OpenAI employees with eye-popping compensation packages, which Altman in June said included $100 million signing bonuses.\n\nWhile Altman at the time said that he was happy that \"at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,\" Zuckerberg successfully hired away some prominent OpenAI talent.\n\nThe Meta CEO, who even hand-delivered soup to an OpenAI employee he was attempting to poach, hired away ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao and three researchers who helped build OpenAI's Zurich office.",

    "description": "Here are the best Adidas Sambas alternatives to wear this fall, from Puma plimsolls to colorful Golas.",
    "fullText": "It's somehow already been nearly three years since the summer everyone switched from Filas to Sambas. And so far, it looks like the slim sneaker trend is here to stay. I personally find them much more practical than dad shoes, and easy to collect in their colorful shades of suede.\n\nSambas debuted in 1949 and were originally designed for soccer players. These days, the ubiquitous sneakers can be spotted on both the preppy and the punk, thanks to their comfortable, versatile design.\n\nAt the peak of the Sambas hype, I considered investing in a pair myself. But, I didn't want to dress like a carbon copy of everyone else. So I decided to explore similar sporty-chic styles — here are the best alternatives to Adidas Sambas I've found, including a handful worn by our style editors.\n\nFor more of the top trendy sneakers we've tested, see our guide to the best retro sneakers.\n\nWhite sneakers are a staple in my everyday wardrobe, whether I'm wearing a dress or athleisure, so I was excited to try some Gola sneakers. The Vipers are a high-quality leather alternatives to Sambas, which offer a similar suede T-toe and a translucent gum sole. After removing them from the box, I was immediately impressed with their sturdy yet flexible feel. They felt comfortable on the first wear.\n\nAlthough they look equally good with leggings or a sundress, my favorite styling choice for these shoes is to have them peeking out from underneath a pair of wide-leg slacks. They add a sporty touch, yet still manage to look polished. These fit true to size. They look good with various sock lengths, but I found them most comfortable with calf-length socks since the tongue of the shoe rubbed against my ankle a bit when I wore them with short socks.\n\nIf you prefer a bright statement sneaker, consider Alohas' low-top leather style. It's available in dozens of vibrant hues like orange, pink, and lime, alongside neutrals in cream and ivory — and of recently, some fresh new colorways. Exposed stitching, perforated details, and contrast accents up the style factor, while the rubber sole keeps them comfy.\n\nI'll admit, I was first clued into Alo's new Sunset Sneakers because I saw that Kendall Jenner is attached to their debut and felt curious as to why the brand keeps putting out more colorways (they're now up to seven). Even more curious is the yoga apparel brand's new foray into footwear and how it'll compare to Lululemon's attempts.\n\nThese have an edge over Sambas because their raised foam insoles offer better cushioning than a completely flat sneaker. They run small and have a narrow toe box, so the brand recommends ordering a half size up.\n\nNew Balance may have perfected the chunky dad sneaker, but the RC42 showcases the versatility of the brand's design language. This plimsoll mixes suede and leather for a multidimensional look.\n\nReviewers note that these tend to run about a half size small, so round up if you plan to wear these with athletic socks. If you prefer a no-show sock, their padded heel collars and tabs will make them easier to break in blister-free.\n\nThese Pumas offer comfort and style, and they're roomy enough for people with wider feet. The retro-inspired sneakers have a low profile, leather upper, and a rubber sole. Another point to consider: Puma has received the Fair Labor Association accreditation for upholding fair labor standards throughout its supply chains and improving working conditions.\n\nCoolway's Kizuna sneakers are designed in Spain and take clear design notes from the Sambas. However, the suede uppers come in a notable amount of pastel shades, which will complement any light-wash jeans you wear them with. They come in unisex European sizing, so be sure to compare the brand's size guide with your foot measurements.\n\nNaturalizer is one of our favorite sources of comfortable women's dress shoes. Its Medina sneakers stand out because several colorways come in narrow, wide and extra wide sizes, with a contoured footbed and cushioned heel cups. So if you've ever felt too squeezed in or unsupported by Sambas, you now have your solution.\n\nThe Stellas are Larroudé's very first pair of sneakers, and a big departure from the brand's somewhat fanciful design language. The Stellas have a luxury-grade aesthetic, yet are still much more affordable than those from Chloé or Loewe. As a bonus, each pair comes with two sets of laces for a more customizable look.\n\nIf totally flat sneakers are too taxing on your feet, consider Adidas' SL 72 style. They look similar to the Sambas but with a slightly raised heel, which can help reduce pressure and alleviate pain. The textile and leather shoe with a rubber outsole comes in 16 unique colorways, including a patterned burgundy option inspired by ornate carpets.\n\nSeavees' leather-and-suede design with a memory foam footbed is crafted with recycled materials in the sport mesh lining, cotton insole cover, polyester laces, and rubber outsole. A fun detail: The shoe (named after the Bay Area Clippers soccer team from the 1960s) has a grippy bottom with a colorful terrazzo-like design.\n\nThese lightweight leather sneakers with suede accents soften and gain a vintage look with each wear. The rubber gum sole adds traction and a retro look. They're great if you want a subtle pop of color — like a fuchsia Nike logo — without an entirely colorful shoe. Customers report they run a bit narrow, though, so they may not be the best fit for people with wide feet.\n\nDolce Vita generally offers a wide variety of colors and patterns in their shoes, and these suede sneakers are no exception. They come in 20 colorways including an icy blue suede with white accents, a leopard-print calf hair version with sparkling silver details, and a sunny yellow. Customers appreciate that these shoes can be dressed up or down, although they run slightly narrow.\n\nThe organic leather that makes up these stylish kicks is super soft and pliable, although they also come in canvas and suede versions. Additional materials include a bio-based E.V.A. from sugar cane, recycled rubber, and recycled polyester. Whether you prefer a lime green leather pair with lilac contrast or a camel-colored suede with black leather details, these are sure to be the focal point of your outfit.\n\nIf you're need a pair of Sambas alternatives to feature in your next vacation post, try packing these as your lightweight, wear-anywhere sneakers. \n\n\"The Essex sneakers are like a cool, more obscure version of the Nike Cortezes. I keep them by my doorway so I can slip them on anytime I walk to the bodega. They're so comfy and light, and they go with everything,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. \"The insides are so plush that I can even wear them without socks. I also love their tube laces — it's a little detail that makes them a bit more unique.\"\n\nThey have a similar fit to ballet flats, with a slim footbed and tapered toe box. Even better, they're made with recycled materials featured in their durable rubber outsoles and silky soft Tencel-based lining.\n\nThese are probably my most-worn sneakers, and this is coming from someone with a closet that's practically brimming with them. I love that the Charlies carry the aesthetic impact of a pair of Sambas or Gazelles, but also have a quiet luxury thing about them. While folks with a high arch may want to add a pair of inserts to these, I find them to be pretty comfortable as-is for walking around all day. They do take a solid three to five wears to break in, but once you've gotten the leather to mold to your feet a little, you'll never want to take these off. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor\n\nThe classic shoe (beloved for its pliable leather and thin, bendable sole that's great for athletes) was recently reinvented with an upgraded design. The new Mexico 66 SD features a refined and more comfortable silhouette while delivering the same sporty-chic style as its predecessor, the Mexico 66. Choose from 14 colorful and muted hues.\n\nA quilted design elevates these leather kicks, available in five colorways including a metallic silver. The Breakaways offer lots of comfort, too, thanks to a cushy, supportive footbed. If you have a wide foot, consider sizing up for a more comfortable fit.\n\nBeckett Simonon shoes are made-to-order, eliminating unsold inventory. The brand also takes pride in creating a favorable work environment for its employees and using the highest quality leather.\n\nThe Morgen Trainers feature a full-grain leather outer with water-repellent suede detailing. Their Vachetta leather lining is temperature-regulating, moisture-absorbing, odor-controlling, and breathable to keep feet feeling fresh and comfortable. The rubber sole is strong yet flexible and water-resistant.\n\nA velcro closure helps differentiate these sneaks from Sambas and makes putting them on effortless. The gummy Talia sneakers are crafted from leather and synthetic materials with a rounded toe and contrast detailing. Customers report a comfortable fit, a soft terry-cloth fabric interior, and true sizing.\n\nRecognizable by the signature blue stitching on the heel, Rothy's sustainable footwear utilizes a knit material that's crafted from recycled plastic water bottles. Plus, the insoles contain recycled foam, the rubber soles are carbon-free, the adhesives are non-toxic and vegan, and the brand uses biodegradable post-consumer recycled materials for its packaging. When I tested the brand's Lace Up Sneaker, I was impressed by the super comfortable knit fabric with no break-in period. They run a little narrow so I recommend sizing up in the cushy kicks.\n\nRead \n\nIf you're looking for a budget-friendly alternative to Adidas Sambas, these 100% synthetic shoes are less than half the price. The Casual Low Top Sneakers come in nine colors, including metallic gold and a two-tone wine red. Amazon customers say the soles are well-made and the shoes feel comfortable and cushioned.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "Two Trinidadian nationals were said to be among six people killed by a US strike. The lawsuit characterized the strike as 'unlawful.'",
    "fullText": "The US armed forces have for months been carrying out lethal strikes against vessels it says were engaged in drug smuggling in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. Now, the families of two men killed in one of those strikes are suing the US government for damages.\n\nTwo family members of Trinidadian nationals said to have been killed in a US boat strike in the Caribbean have accused the federal government of engaging in \"unlawful\" activity.\n\nThis case appears to mark the first wrongful-death lawsuit filed in federal court against the Trump administration in response to the strikes. Since September, the US has killed more than 100 people in this campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit identified two men, Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, as having been among the six people killed on October 14, 2025. The lawsuit said that a US missile struck their vessel while it was sailing from Venezuela to Trinidad. Joseph and Samaroo were returning home after fishing in waters off the Venezuelan coast and working on farms in the country, the complaint said.\n\nJoseph, 26 at the time of his death, lived in Las Cuevas, Trinidad, per the lawsuit. The filing says that he had tried to return to Trinidad earlier in the summer but was unable to travel after the boat he planned to take experienced engine trouble. He later secured another ride home in October.\n\nSamaroo, 41 at the time of his death and also a resident of Las Cuevas, had been working on a farm in Venezuela after his early release on parole, according to the lawsuit, which says he had previously served 15 years in prison for a homicide conviction.\n\nThe attack on the boat \"was part of an unprecedented and manifestly unlawful US military campaign,\" the suit, filed in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, added, calling them \"premeditated and intentional killings\" that \"lack any plausible legal justification.\" It argued there's no situation in which such action would have been acceptable.\n\nAt the time of the boat strike, President Donald Trump characterized the six men as \"narcoterrorists\" and said the boat was \"associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks\" and was involved in the trafficking of narcotics along a known route.\n\nThe lawsuit rejected these claims, saying Joseph and Samaroo weren't members of or affiliated with drug cartels. The filing further stated that the Trinidadian government has \"no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities.\"\n\nJoseph's mother, Lenore Burnley, and Samaroo's sister, Sallycar Korasingh, are named as the plaintiffs in this new lawsuit. The filing invokes the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute, federal laws that allow families to pursue wrongful-death claims arising in international waters and, in some cases, allege violations of international law in US courts.\n\n\"These premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification,\" the lawsuit said. \"Thus they were simply murders, ordered by individuals at the highest levels of government and obeyed by military officers in the chain of command.\"\n\nThe White House told Business Insider in a request for comment that \"The October 14 strike was conducted against narcoterrorists,\" and that Trump \"used his lawful authority to take decisive action against the scourge of illicit narcotics\" coming into the US. The Department of Defense said it does not comment on ongoing litigation as a matter of policy.\n\nLawmakers, officials, and experts across fields have debated the legality of the US campaign since it began in September. The Trump administration has justified its attacks, saying the targets are people and vessels bringing drugs into the US.\n\nLegal experts, though, have said that the strikes don't follow the proper protocols for interdicting alleged drug trafficking vessels and have questionable legal backing. Lethal action is not the norm for US counter-narcotics operations. Multiple reports on these operations aimed at stemming the flow of drugs into the US have raised concerns about the violation of the laws of armed conflict.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is going scorched-earth with Vinod Khosla after the billionaire VC founder accused the Tesla CEO of promoting racism and made an open call to Musk's employees to quit.\n\nOn Monday evening, Khosla said on X that Musk frames racism as a \"great and desirable paradigm,\" responding to a September post from the CEO in which Musk said \"white people are a rapidly diminishing minority of global population.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO has promoted posts in the past regarding changing demographics around the white population.\n\nIn his post, Khosla called on employees at Musk's companies to ditch their employers and join Khosla Ventures' portfolio, which includes AI startups such as OpenAI and Replit.\n\n\"All non-whites in @tesla, @SpaceX @X etc and all decent whites should quit and join our portfolio,\" Khosla, an Indian-American who immigrated to the US in the 1970s, wrote. \"Email us your linkedin!\"\n\nMusk fired insults at Khosla in response, calling the VC a \"pompous asshole\" and a slur for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\n\"Vinod, you're not just such a pompous asshole that you tried to stop the public from using a public beach near your house…\" Musk wrote. \"My partner, Shivon, is half Indian and my eldest son with her is named in honor of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.\"\n\nMusk appeared to be referring to Khosla's yearslong attempt to block public access to a beach near the VC's home on the Peninsula coast in San Mateo County. Khosla has fought for years against public access to Martins Beach, which runs through his $37 million estate, and has filed multiple lawsuits over the issue.\n\nKhosla and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe two billionaires have clashed before. In 2024, Khosla declined to endorse President Donald Trump after Musk urged the VC to vote for a Trump-Vance ticket. The VC has also called Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI \"a bit of sour grapes.\"\n\nKhosla's most recent comment on Musk came just hours after he spoke out against the ICE shooting in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration,\" Khosla wrote. \"The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society.\"\n\nThe VC founder was just one of many business and tech leaders who spoke out on social media to denounce the ICE shooting.",

    "description": "Former high-end real estate brokers, Tal and Oren, are accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women with their brother, Alon Alexander.",
    "fullText": "Are Tal and Oren Alexander — once among the nation's top luxury real estate brokers — serial predators who, together with a third brother, drugged and sexually assaulted dozens of women and girls over more than a decade?\n\nOr are they simply womanizers whose party-fueled lifestyle involved lots of consensual sex?\n\nThat's a pivotal question a six-man, six-woman jury will have to consider over the course of Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander's sex-trafficking trial that's unfolding over the next several weeks in a Manhattan federal courtroom.\n\nOpening arguments in the criminal case began on January 27, with the Alexanders' defense team and the US government presenting dramatically different, dueling portrayals of the sibling trio.\n\nA conviction could send Tal Alexander, 39, and his 38-year-old twin brothers to prison for life and mark an extraordinary downfall for the real estate agent siblings whose high-profile clients included Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, financier Leon Black, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nHere are some of the most striking moments from the Alexander brothers' trial so far:\n\nAn accuser using the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" who was the first government witness to testify, broke down in tears as she told the jury she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012 when she was 20 years old.\n\nMoore said that she woke up naked with Alon Alexander standing over her, also naked, at the Manhattan apartment he shared with Tal Alexander, in the hours after an NBA Finals viewing party at the nearby penthouse of actor Zac Efron.\n\n\"I was shocked, and I had no idea how I got there,\" Moore testified, adding that she tried two or three times to get out of the bed, but \"Alon kept pushing me back down.\"\n\n\"I don't want to have sex with you!\" she recalled telling Alon Alexander, who she said laughed and told her, \"But you already did.\"\n\nHe continued to assault her as she desperately screamed out \"no\" over and over, Moore said.\n\nAt some point, Moore testified, Tal Alexander walked in, and as the two brothers were talking, Alon Alexander \"was raping\" her.\n\nShe said she left while Alon Alexander was asleep. Within hours, she discovered she was bruised on the right side of her body, including \"a hand print.\"\n\nDuring opening statements, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser told the jury that the Alexander brothers \"celebrated their crimes.\"\n\n\"For example,\" the prosecutor said, \"after Oren and Alon sexually assaulted three high school girls in a hotel room, Oren texted a friend that he took down a 17-year-old.\"\n\nSmyser said the Alexander brothers used \"power, wealth, and access to lure women and girls to them\" at upscale locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\nSmyser, the Manhattan federal prosecutor, told jurors that the Alexander brothers texted each other about their conquests, at one point saying that \"the only thing that could bring them down is if some 'hoe' complained.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said the Alexander brothers \"used whatever means necessary\" — including drugging victims and using \"brute force\" — to carry out sex attacks.\n\nThey \"carried out their rapes in different ways,\" said Smyser. \"They physically held victims down\" and put drugs like GHB and Xanax in their drinks, getting the women so intoxicated that, in one instance, their victim could not stand up, she said.",

    "description": "Paramount+ snagged about a million new customers on the day of its first UFC event, an exec told employees, as close to 5 million viewers tuned in.",
    "fullText": "UFC is already a hit for Paramount+.\n\nParamount's flagship streaming service generated about a million new subscribers on the day of its first-ever UFC event, Paramount product chief Dane Glasgow told employees in a town hall on Tuesday morning, three staffers who attended the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson said: \"Those numbers are unverified, and it's against our policy to share speculative data externally.\"\n\nIn August, Paramount did a deal with UFC parent TKO that will see it pay $7.7 billion to secure UFC rights in the US for seven years.\n\nGlasgow said at the town hall that Saturday was the second-largest day of sign-ups ever for its streamer, and that UFC 324 was the second-most-streamed sporting event on the service, according to two employees.\n\nNotably, Paramount made its UFC matches available for anyone with a Paramount+ subscription, which starts at $8.99 a month. Before the Paramount deal, many UFC matches were only on pay-per-view for around $80 each.\n\nParamount previously announced that its UFC broadcast had just under 5 million average viewers for the main card. Paramount CEO David Ellison told staffers in an email that it was \"the largest-ever exclusive live event for Paramount+.\" The streamer has drawn larger audiences to other non-exclusive live events, including NFL games that ran on both Paramount+ and CBS.\n\n\"This record-breaking performance is, above all, a testament to the extraordinary teamwork across our entire company,\" Ellison told employees in his memo, which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\nFor context, Netflix's Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight added about 1.4 million US subscribers to that service in November 2024, according to the subscription data firm Antenna. The firm only tracks US data.\n\nAntenna estimated that Paramount+ reeled in an estimated 3.2 million new US customers when it hosted the Super Bowl in 2024.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to employees below:\n\nA huge congratulations to everyone who contributed to the success of our first UFC event on Paramount+! Several members of our leadership team and I were cageside Saturday night, and we were completely blown away by the experience and by the intensity, skill and heart on display across the card. We left the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas more excited and energized than ever about our partnership with Dana White and the entire TKO/UFC team.\n\nI've heard from several executives at TKO/UFC, and they also could not be more pleased with how everything came together. It was a fantastic start to our 7-year partnership!\n\nWhile we went into the weekend with high expectations, I'm thrilled to share that we exceeded them, reaching nearly 5 million streaming views — the largest-ever exclusive live event for Paramount+. And the actual audience was likely even higher, given how common co-viewing is among UFC fans.\n\nThis record-breaking performance is, above all, a testament to the extraordinary teamwork across our entire company. Every single business unit, division and team — from Paramount+, Paramount Pictures and CBS to MTV, BET, Nickelodeon and Pluto, as well as Marketing, Social, Ad Sales, Technology, Events and more — came together, rolled up their sleeves and got creative. The incredible power of Paramount One to reach the broadest possible audience was on full display companywide, and UFC 324 stands as our strongest example yet of what we can achieve when we all work together toward a common goal.\n\nAgain, hats off to everyone. With nearly 5 million streaming views and record-breaking engagement, UFC 324 set the bar high, and we can't wait to keep the momentum going at UFC 325 next weekend in Sydney!",

    "description": "Make your picture look better, reduce buffering, and keep your apps running smoothly.",
    "fullText": "Whether you're a smart TV veteran or are somehow just now setting your first TV with an internet connection, there's a lot to learn. Modern TVs are basically computers, complete with their own operating systems and application ecosystems. That means you can tweak them to run better.—or just the way you want them to. Here are a few tips, tricks, and hacks that every smart TV owner should be aware of.\n\nWondering why every single TV show and movie you watch on your brand new TV looks like a soap opera or a cheap community theater production? It's probably because of motion smoothing.\n\nThis \"feature\", which is the default on far too many TVs, artificially ups the frame rate from either 24 or 30 frames per second to 60 or 120 frames, or even higher. This effect can bring a real immediacy to live events like sports, but it's not great for regular old TV shows. Because where does the TV get those extra frames from? It makes them up, often creating an uncanny blurring effect reminiscent of old school videotape. I recommend turning this feature off basically the minute you set up your TV, and our friends at PCMag have a guide to disabling the feature covering all the major smart TV platforms.\n\nStreaming 4k takes up a lot of bandwidth. Modern wifi routers can usually handle without much of an issue, especially if your TV is close to your router. Even so, it's a good idea to physically connect your smart TV to your network with an ethernet cable if you have the option.\n\nThere's a couple of reasons to do this. One, wired connections are more stable, mostly because they're not vulnerable to interference from neighboring wireless networks and other devices, so you'll be far less like to suffer through stuttering images or audio dropouts. Two, connecting your TV via ethernet frees up the wireless spectrum for all of your other devices, which is important if you live in a house with other internet users (not to mention other smart devices).\n\nSmart TVs tend to come pre-loaded with any number of apps, all of them prominently placed on the home screen. You can, and should, move the apps you actually use to the top instead. How to do this will vary depending on your operating system, but it generally means pressing and holding on the app you want was at the top of the list and then moving it around. Failing that, you may need to do some digging in the settings.\n\nTired of all the ads showing up on your TV? You might be able to block them using your router. Lifehacker has a guide to blocking ads on Samsung, LG, and Roku smart TVs that explains how to change your internet settings so that your TV can't access the ads in the interface anymore.\n\nSmart TVs are basically computers, meaning they need to boot up when you turn them on. Most users don't want to wait every time they turn on the TV though, which is why smart TVs don't actually turn off—they suspend their functions, the same way your phone or laptop does. That's fine if you use your TV constantly, but a real waste of electricity for a TV that you only turn on occasionally. And shutting down your set completely could have another benefit: reducing bugginess. To reiterate, a smart TV is basically a computer, and every computer user knows that restarting your computer can fix random problems.\n\nSome TVs allow you to disable this feature—just look for a \"quick start\" option in the settings. Others, including Sony, suggest that you unplug TVs you won't be using for months at a time in order to shut them down completely.\n\nStreaming television is great, but don't overlook traditional broadcast TV. Most major cultural events, from the Super Bowl, to the Oscars, to the World Series, are still free to watch on network TV, as are of the most popular shows. If you live in a major city, or even just close to one, there's a good chance you can watch network TV free of charge using nothing more than a small TV antenna. This can mean free access to stations like NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and PBS—no need to pay for cable or a pricey \"live tv\" streaming subscription. All you need to do is plug in an antenna, scan for channels, and you're good to go. (Lifehacker has a guide to the best digital TV antennas to help you get started.)\n\nNot to keep harping on this point, but a smart TV is a computer, and like a computer, it can build up all sorts of junk in its memory over time. If your smart TV is suddenly moving more slowly than you remember, or even crashing, it might be time to clear out its various caches. Get started with this guide to clearing the cache on every major smart TV brand.\n\nYour smart TV is a potential security risk. It's a computer, like any other, and that means you need to keep it up to date, secure all accounts connected to it, and be mindful of any built-in microphones and cameras. Check out our guide to securing your smart TV for more on these tips and more.\n\nI've written about why smart TVs are so cheap, and it turns out a big part of it is automatic content recognition, or ACR. Most brands of smart TVs are constantly monitoring what you're watching and using that to build a profile with your viewing habits that can be sold to third parties, a practice that nets the TV manufacturers are lot of money. If this concerns you, consider turning the feature off to protect your privacy. Lifehacker has a guide to disabling ACR on the major smart TV platforms.\n\nIf you want your smart TV to have an entirely different look and feel, you may be able to install a different launcher, which will give you much more control. Google TV users, for example, can install Projectivy to completely replace the default launcher. This won't be an option for every model of smart TV, but it's worth considering if you're feeling stuck with the software that came preinstalled.",

    "title": "These 'Obsolete' iPhones Just Received a New Update",
    "description": "Apple just issued an update for an iPhone that's over 12 years old.",
    "fullText": "Many of us choose to upgrade our smartphones every two or three years, while others pick up the latest model every year. But just because it's the norm to swap out your smartphone on a regular basis, that doesn't mean all of us do. Smartphones can last a long time, especially if you maintain it with the occasional battery replacement.\n\nBut no piece of technology lasts forever. Eventually, something gives out—even if it's just the company that makes it. Even Apple, which usually offers its iPhones a number of years of updates after their original release, drops support for new features after some time. That's why your iPhone XS can't run iOS 26: Apple drew the line here this year. But iPhones like the XS can still receive updates, even if they aren't the latest and greatest version of iOS. Instead, Apple tends to issue security and stability patches to older iPhones, to ensure the users who still rely on them can do so safely and securely. It might be in Apple's best financial interest to persuade you to buy a new iPhone, but not at the cost of putting a large number of users at risk of cyber attacks.\n\nApple dropped new updates for an assortment of devices on Monday. That includes its latest devices, of course, which can now install iOS 26.2.1. But a host of older devices also received new updates, some of which are particularly surprising, considering their age.\n\nApple released iOS 18.7.4 for iPhones that either can't or won't update to iOS 26. In the former category, that basically includes the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. Then, there's iOS 16.7.13, for iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X, and iOS 15.8.6, for iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPhone SE (first-gen). Those are some old iPhones, but that's not what caught my eye today. In a twist, Apple dropped an update for iPhones running iOS 12, including iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones can now run iOS 12.5.8. For reference, Apple released iOS 12 back in 2018, so it's pretty wild to see a new version in 2026.\n\nThese iPhones are even older. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus dropped all the way back in 2014, while the iPhone 5S released the year before that. As such, Apple just sent an update to 12-year-old iPhone. If you're still rocking one of these devices, that new update must be quite the surprise. It's even more than the age of the devices itself: Apple considers all three of these iPhones \"obsolete,\" as the company stopped selling them more than seven years ago. The company will not service the hardware for obsolete products, and largely omits them from future software releases. That's why this is so interesting.\n\niOS 12.5.8 is, of course, not a feature update, but it's also not a security update, either. Instead, Apple extended the certificate required for features like iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation to continue working after January of next year. These iPhones might not have seen a new feature in years, but they'll still be able to FaceTime in a year's time—and that's pretty great.\n\nIt's not clear how many people are using these iPhones in 2026. But if you do, and it's working for you, Apple gave you one more reason to keep your phone for another year.",

    "description": "Venezuelans are circumventing the government’s expanded crackdown on dissent by speaking in code, not mentioning political leaders, constantly deleting content from their phones and refusing to express opinions in WhatsApp groups.",
    "fullText": "“Delete your conversations before going out.”\n\nThese recent WhatsApp messages of a Venezuelan family – who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals – underscore the caution civilians are taking in their daily conversations, on social media and in text messages as the government expands its crackdown on dissenting speech.\n\nReports of authorities searching civilians’ phones for political content critical of the government have increased since officials declared a state of emergency in response to the US attack in Caracas, which led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAuthorities have set up more checkpoints along the streets of the capital and other parts of the country, claiming they’re necessary to reinforce national security amid political tension. Some are stationary, usually near security zones or public institutions, but others are mobile. Officers stop drivers, ask where they are going, search the vehicles, and often go through their cell phones.\n\nAlthough phone searches are nothing new, testimonies gathered by CNN show that these measures have increased since the government’s emergency decree after the January 3 US attack.\n\nThe decree enables authorities to adopt extraordinary measures, but it does not detail the scope, the criteria, or whether it limits the rights and freedoms of citizens such as the protection of privacy in communications.\n\nOn the other hand, article 48 of Venezuela’s constitution explicitly states: “The secrecy and inviolability of private communications in all their forms is guaranteed. They may not be interfered with except by order of a competent court, in accordance with legal provisions, and preserving the secrecy of any private matters not related to the corresponding legal process.”\n\nNevertheless, CNN has spoken with several Venezuelans who have had their phones searched in recent weeks. Because of this, many speak in code, avoid mentioning political leaders, constantly delete content from their phones and refuse to express opinions in WhatsApp groups.\n\nSince Maduro’s capture by the US, daily life for ordinary Venezuelans has become full of uncertainty.\n\nExactly who is in charge of the country is unclear. While US President Donald Trump has claimed to be “running” Venezuela, Maduro’s former deputy – the now acting president Delcy Rodríguez – has pushed back, saying on Sunday that she’d had “enough” of US orders.\n\nStill, there is no sign yet that she plans an election that would legitimize her rule. Meanwhile, the economy remains in crisis and the prices of basic products fluctuate daily.\n\nThe one thing that is certain, for anybody who might be perceived as a critic of the government, is the need to take precautions when going out in the street.\n\n“This afternoon we received a statement from the neighborhood community council, and they recommended we be careful with what we say on WhatsApp and in writing,” reads one of the group messages seen by CNN.\n\nAnother message is from a family member who is outside the country and mentions their desire to go to Venezuela. A relative responds that it is better not to because “right now things are complicated.”\n\nIn response to the insistence of another family member who says they will travel anyway, they suggest deleting social media accounts and creating a new Google account. According to what CNN was able to verify, cell phones of people entering the country are also checked when they arrive at the airport.\n\nAt the request of their loved ones, families in other countries have told CNN that they, too, avoid political conversations and use code words on their phones to communicate with relatives in Venezuela.\n\nEven before Maduro’s fall, routine checkpoints could become nightmares for civilians.\n\nThis is what a cook experienced in April of last year. The cook, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said that when he left his house on his way to work that day, an agent of the SEBIN intelligence service forced him to stop just after a bridge in western Caracas. They did not ask for papers or his ID card.\n\nThe first question was about his job. “Head chef,” he answered. The second question went straight to politics. “Are you a guarimbero?,” they asked, using a term the government coined to pejoratively refer to anti-government protesters. He replied that he was a cook and insisted that he worked as a head chef.\n\nHe even told the agent that he had recently become a father and just wanted to go to work and get home soon to see his newborn daughter. But instead of letting him go, they told him that they would check his car and cell phone.\n\nAfter authorities asked him to unlock his phone, they typed keywords in the chat search such as guarimba – or street protest – and names like Diosdado Cabello (Venezuela’s interior minister) and Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe cook told CNN that several of his friends had gone through similar situations, so he made a habit of reading and deleting any political content, although somewhere in his photo gallery he kept a picture with the opposition leader María Corina Machado. When they typed Maduro in the WhatsApp search, only recipes with plantains or ripe tomatoes appeared (maduro means ripe in English). And in the photo gallery, they only found pictures of dishes and his daughter.\n\nThe thorough search lasted about an hour “between intimidating messages and the same suspicious questions,” he recalls. During the vehicle inspection, one of the officers showed an interest in a motorcycle accessory he had in his truck. “Keep it. I don’t even have a motorcycle anymore,” the cook said, trying to end the situation with a gesture. Immediately after that, they gave him the signal to go on his way.\n\nAs he took off, he looked in the rearview mirror and saw other cars lined up waiting to be searched. Still, with a mix of fear and resignation, he drove away.\n\nThe experience affected him to the point that he now avoids political conversations entirely. Today, he says that if he receives a message on that topic, he asks to change the subject, deletes the texts and immediately empties the chat. He avoids going out alone, especially at night, because he says the number of checkpoints has increased. He also believes having tattoos draws more attention from officers. He says he has already been searched three times in less than six months.\n\nA journalist experienced a similar situation in December. In broad daylight and after sharing a coffee with colleagues, the journalist, who prefers not to be identified for fear of reprisals, was traveling down the Country Club route heading to El Bosque, in eastern Caracas, when he came across a police checkpoint that was stopping all the cars passing through the area, he said. This is the route the reporter usually takes when using “green paths,” or alternative ways to avoid traffic.\n\nThe procedure began with the usual requests: papers, ID and driver’s license. But then, they focused their attention on his wallet, he says. He recounts that when he opened it, a small, folded paper fell out, and he immediately felt the atmosphere change. The officers argued that they suspected he possessed marijuana, so they decided to do a more thorough inspection.\n\nThe tension increased. The officer asked for his phone and began to check it, also looking for keywords in his chats, traces of drug use, or anything that could implicate wrongdoing. The journalist says he did not have marijuana or any other drug in the car.\n\nFortunately, he says, the officers did not identify his profession and in their search did not include politically charged words that could have exposed conversations with his bosses, sources or colleagues. But he felt that fear throughout the search, which lasted almost an hour, leaving him extremely nervous and desperate to get out of the situation as soon as possible. He knew the episode was over when he heard the phrase: “Well, whatever you want to contribute.” He handed over a $50 bill from his wallet before continuing home.\n\nThe episode still affects his daily decisions. He has left several WhatsApp groups and frequently deletes content from his phone. He now avoids going out at night and limits his outings even during the day, leaving the house only when necessary.\n\nBoth men say they were surprised by the checkpoint, but not by the situation, given how increasingly frequent these measures have become.\n\nMany civilians have taken to social media to report phone inspections, which sometimes lead to intimidation, extortion and even detention. Many claims are made by men, who say authorities often demand payments in exchange for allowing drivers to continue. Security forces also search women, even in the presence of children. All testimonies agree that agents are looking for political content, especially for terms such as “invasion” or “Trump” and “Maduro.” But during the searches, personal and even intimate content has also been exposed, leading to complaints that the practice violates constitutional protections of private life.\n\nCNN has reached out to the interior ministry, which oversees most of these checkpoints, but has not yet received a response.\n\nWhen asked about the issue by a journalist, Maracaibo Mayor Giancarlo Di Martino said on January 17 that cellphone inspections were “completely prohibited, so any officer who abuses their authority must be reported.”\n\nSome people are not clear about their individual rights, including the right to privacy. Others know them, but fear being detained if they try to exercise them.\n\nThe non-governmental organization Espacio Público has shared recommendations on social media for those who encounter inspections: ask the officer to show necessary court orders that would allow a search, take note of the agent’s name and the entity they belong to in case there is no court order, and – if possible – try to have at least two witnesses and keep phone data encrypted, among other things.",

    "fullText": "The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group is now in the Indian Ocean, putting it closer to assist in any potential US operations targeting Iran, two sources told CNN.\n\nThe group is within the area of responsibility of US Central Command, whose purview includes military operations in the Middle East.\n\nStill, the carrier is not necessarily in a final position for any potential operation. President Donald Trump continues to consider options for striking Iran, but there is no indication any decision has been made.\n\nA carrier strike group normally includes an aircraft carrier, guided missile cruisers, anti-aircraft warships and anti-submarine destroyers or frigates.\n\nCNN has previously reported the carrier was en route to the region.\n\nAllies have been urging the US to forestall any military action.\n\nIn Iran, the death toll from the government’s crackdown on protesters continues to climb. On Sunday, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported that 5,520 protesters have been killed since demonstrations started late last month. It said that an additional 17,091 deaths were still being reviewed.\n\nTrump has warned Iran against killing protesters, repeatedly threatening to intervene in the country if it does so. Last week, however, he said that Iran “wants to talk,” suggesting that the US may enter discussions with Tehran.\n\nOn Monday, the administration reiterated it is open to having discussions with the Iranian regime as long as “they know what the terms are,” a US official said.\n\n“We are open for business … as they say, so if they want to contact us and they know what the terms are, then we’re going to have the conversation,” the official said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic is bracing for a potential US attack. In Tehran, a large mural was unveiled in Revolution Square on Sunday depicting a swarm of jet fighters flying over a warship bearing the US flag.\n\nDuring Friday prayers in the capital, the imam leading the sermon warned the US against launching any attacks.\n\n“The trillion dollars you invested in the region are under the watch of our missiles,” Mohammad Ali Akbari said.\n\nIran has been escalating its rhetoric against the US over the past week, warning that any attack would be met with force capable of destabilizing the entire Middle East.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei told journalists Monday that Tehran is “more than capable” of responding to any aggression from the US with a “regretful” response.\n\n“The arrival of one or several warships does not impact Iran’s defensive determination,” he said. “Our armed forces are monitoring every development and are not wasting a single second to enhance their capabilities.”\n\nOn Saturday, the Iranian military said its missile capabilities and efficiency have increased significantly since the 12-day war with Israel in June. Iran launched multiple waves of missile and drone attacks at Israeli targets during that conflict, which started after Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran last year, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists. The United States later joined, targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nIran possesses a large arsenal of medium- and long-range ballistic missiles, several types of which were fired at Israel during the conflict. Its drones, a pillar of its military power, have also been deployed beyond its borders, including in Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nMaj. Gen. Ali Abdollahi, the commander of Iran’s Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, a key military operational command, said last week that any aggression against his country “will immediately turn all American interests, bases and centers of influence into legitimate, definite and accessible targets” for Iran.\n\nIranian officials have also warned that a US attack would lead to strikes on Washington’s allies in the region. US-allied Arab nations in the Persian Gulf have lobbied Trump against a strike, according to regional officials speaking to CNN this month.\n\nIran also has a network of regional proxies that could potentially be mobilized in the event of a strike. While some of its surrogates, such as Hezbollah, have been significantly weakened by Israel over the past two years, others remain heavily armed.\n\nOn Sunday, Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi, the commander of Kataeb Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq, called on Iran’s loyalists “across the globe … to prepare for all-out war in support of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”\n\n“We tell the enemies, the war against the (Islamic) Republic, will not be a walk in the park,” he said.\n\nCNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Computers still don’t do well with vagueness and uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "In college I took a medieval studies seminar on the origins of British common law. There I learned how chancery judges in 14th-century England decided property disputes by applying their own reasoning when testimonies conflicted and records were unclear or incomplete. It was a formative class for me and one whose lessons I return to often. It has remained critical in my work advising companies, even though it didn’t contain a single number, management principle or economic theory.\n\nArtificial intelligence is poised to profoundly affect American business, and executives are rethinking the skills they seek in colleagues and advisers. For my part, I’m reminded of the value of an education deep in reading, research and analysis — one that teaches how to approach problems with no definitive answers.\n\nMy college education taught me how to think, not what to think. That is what proves most useful when navigating strategic and financial decisions in a technology-driven world. Today, A.I. is near the center of every boardroom discussion I witness. Roughly half the S&P 500 companies mentioned A.I. on their most recent earnings calls, and they speak of the new technology as a force that no serious institution can ignore.\n\nThere is little doubt A.I. will be transformative. And yet, for all the disruption it promises, I am struck by how much will remain unchanged. The most consequential decisions in business have never been about processing information faster or detecting patterns more efficiently. The most salient concerns are questions such as what kind of enterprise a firm should aspire to be, what culture it should embrace, what risks it should tolerate and how its leaders can plan when the path forward is unclear. These are questions of judgment, and judgment cannot be automated — at least not any time soon.\n\nWhat do I mean by “judgment”? The capacity to arbitrate among competing values and differences of opinion, to weigh considerations that matter independently but cannot be satisfied all at once, to consider several paths of action to alight on the best one. Judgment is the faculty we rely on when trade-offs are unavoidable and the right answer is not waiting to be computed. It is a uniquely human skill.\n\nNot long ago, a client was seeking to sell a portion of its business to raise capital. The company faced a choice: offload a high-growth unit that was volatile and not central to the business or a slower-growth unit that better aligned with the company’s mission. An A.I.-assisted analysis recommended selling the slow-growing business, which made sense in purely mathematical terms. But judgment dictated the other path: Sell the volatile unit and improve the other one. Even though it’s too soon to know which path will be correct, I was struck by the certainty of A.I.’s answer.\n\nA.I. excels at pattern recognition, code generation and the synthesis of large volumes of text and data. But someone still has to decide whether an analysis is trustworthy, what implications it carries and whether acting on it would be wise. Someone has to connect the output of a model to the broader context, such as the political environment, the regulatory landscape and the human dynamics at play.\n\nLast year a board wanted to know how much it should offer for a business it wanted to buy. We fed a huge amount of data into an A.I. model, which suggested a valuation that seemed low to me. The chief executives of the two companies had a fraught relationship, and we debated whether the deal price would need to be higher. Sure enough, when the company offered the A.I.-recommended price, it was rejected. The higher price was later accepted and the transaction secured. The model could not account for the interpersonal dynamics. Judgment could.\n\nThis is why I doubt that A.I. will soon match human cognition or that the defining skills of the next generation of professionals will be narrowly technological. Technical fluency matters, of course. But in a world of abundant machine intelligence, the most durable advantage will be broad intellectual range.\n\nThere is a tendency in higher education and in business to push people toward specialization. A.I. accelerates that pressure. If a machine can do the general work, the conventional wisdom goes, humans should retreat to the specific. I believe the opposite. As routine analysis becomes automated, what distinguishes professionals is the ability to synthesize across domains, to see patterns that specialists miss, to exercise judgment.\n\nToday, when hiring, leaders I know look for what might be called a generalist with judgment, someone analytical and adaptable who is nimble enough to learn skills and become reasonably conversant in new knowledge. The best candidates share a quality no machine can replicate. They think independently, navigate ambiguity without waiting for instruction, analyze the questions that were not asked but should have been and own their decisions. They use A.I. — as a tool but not a crutch.\n\nThat medieval law seminar of long ago helped prepare me for this world more than my courses in finance and economics. Just as centuries ago those judges rendered decisions amid reasonable disagreement, where evidence was mixed and incomplete, professionals today must possess the skills to make things better where machines cannot.\n\nBlair Effron is a co-founder of Centerview Partners, an investment bank.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "title": "Your iPhone Might Not Be Fully Compatible With Apple's New AirTag",
    "description": "If so, you're better off buying a first-gen AirTag.",
    "fullText": "On Monday, Apple released a new AirTag—but you wouldn't know that from looking at it. The new AirTag is visibly identical to the old one, despite dropping nearly five years later. But the point of this refresh wasn't to introduce a new design, or even a remarkably improved tracker. Instead, Apple added a couple subtle upgrades that benefit new buyers, without displacing existing AirTag users.\n\nThere are two key improvements here: The first impacts Precision Finding, Apple's system to guide you to lost items. Your device uses its ultra wideband (UWB) chip to give you detailed directions to the location of your AirTag, including haptics, visual, and auditory cues. The second-gen AirTags have a newer UWB chip, which boosts Precision Finding by 50%. That means your new AirTag can be as much as 1.5 times farther away than your old AirTag while still showing up in Precision Finding. Those improvements carry over to the speaker, as well. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original model, which could help you hear your missing tracker better, especially if it's buried somewhere like a couch cushion.\n\nThe main thing that didn't change was the most important part: the price. One AirTag is still $29, while a four-pack is still $99. But before you go out an buy one (or four), you should know that your iPhone might not be able to take advantage of these new perks. If so, you'd be better off spending your money on the first-gen AirTag.\n\nAs noted by Techradar, the new AirTag actually requires iPhones and iPads to be running iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 before they can connect. That immediately eliminates any iPhones and iPads that do not support these latest updates, of course (generally any iPhones older than the iPhone 11) but it also presents a challenge to anyone who has simply been holding off from installing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. If you want to use these newest AirTags, you'll need to update. If you don't want to update, stick with the OG AirTags.\n\nEven if your iPhone is running iOS 26, it might not work with one of the new AirTag's big features. In order to take advantage of that 50% improved Precision Finding, you need an iPhone 15 or newer. That's because these iPhones also come with Apple's newest UWB chip, which is necessary for that upgraded location feature. (The iPhone 16e unfortunately does not have this new UWB chip.)\n\nIf you have an iPhone 14 or older running iOS 26, you'll still be able to use Precision Finding with the new AirTag, but it'll be the standard Precision Finding experience you had with the original. (Apple Watches can also take advantage of this standard Precision Finding, so long as you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, running watchOS 26.2.1.)\n\nApple doesn't sell the first-generation AirTag anymore, but that's not an issue. If you don't meet all of the specifications above, you should look into buying the older AirTags.\n\nThat's not because the new AirTags won't work just as well; I only say this because you can save some serious money. Instead of dropping $99 on a four-pack of second-gen AirTags, you can currently spend $69.99 on a four-pack of first-gen AirTags. These trackers will work exactly the same, minus the louder speaker on the second-gen AirTags, all the while saving you $30. You can also save a bit off a single AirTag, as the first-gen AirTags are going for $25.99 on Amazon.\n\nIf you'd rather future-proof your AirTags, you could spend full-price on the second-gens without worry. However, if you don't plan to upgrade your iPhone anytime soon, this is a pretty solid deal.",

    "title": "How to Set a Different Volume Level for Each App on Your Mac",
    "description": "It's as simple as moving a slider, but did you know that you can set a different volume level for each Mac app?",
    "fullText": "A free app that lets you lower or mute alert tones while maintaining media volume, FineTune is good enough for most people. It's open-source, and has a few simple sliders that let you control each app's volume level. My previous pick for this job—BackgroundMusic—no longer works well, as it hasn't been updated in a while. FineTune's come in to fill that gap nicely, and it does what it says on the tin.\n\nOnce you install the app, you can click its menu bar icon to finetune any individual app's volume. When an app starts playing audio on your Mac, it'll appear in FineTune's interface. And once you're done moving your sliders to change volume levels, you'll quickly discover a couple of other useful features, such as controlling the volume levels of each of your output device (speakers, headphones, etc.), and an equalizer for each app on your computer. You can also send audio from one app to a specific speaker or headphone. I've used these features to lower my AirPods' volume while keeping my Mac's speaker louder, and to set a bass-friendly EQ preset on those AirPods. You can play around with these tools to get the job done according to your needs, too.\n\nFineTune also has a convenient volume boost feature, which lets you increase the volume up to 400% on a per-app basis. This is good for files where the volume levels are almost inaudible, but I'd be choosy about how you use it.\n\nMost people will be happy with FineTune's feature set and lack of a price tag. However, if you need an app that can control AirPlay devices in your house, send audio to multiple devices at once, enable a per-app EQ with two dozen presets, set a preferred device order for audio output, and much more, then you should consider SoundSource 6 ($49). The app's been around for over a decade, and the newest version released towards the end of 2025.\n\nWith SoundSource, the basic functionality lets you control the audio levels of each app, but it also has a few other neat touches. My favorite feature is the one that lets you mute all sound effects with just one click. I'm not sure about you, but alert sounds from messaging apps tend to make me a bit anxious. Some of my friends tend to send multiple short texts at once, too, which makes my Mac's speaker go off like a siren. I've tried putting my Mac on do-not-disturb mode, but that hides those alerts altogether, which isn't ideal either. Ever since I got SoundSource, I've just muted all sound effects. This lets me receive notifications without the annoying tones, and it allows me to watch movies sans interruptions from alert tones.\n\nYou can also group multiple devices in SoundSource, and send audio to all of them at once, which is an easy way to create a multi-room audio setup. Of course, you can't have your audio 100% in sync, so don't get your hopes up about creating a surround sound system with five cheap Bluetooth speakers. However, it's good enough if you just want to have music playing in every room of your house while you cook, clean, or just move around. SoundSource's support for AirPlay devices means that you can send audio to your HomePod and other AirPlay devices like TVs or speakers, too.\n\nSoundSource also has granular controls for various features. As an example, you can set up a keyboard shortcut to increase or decrease your microphone's volume, or to mute the mic altogether. Another interesting feature lets you set up a mute timer, which sets the volume to zero for up to 2 minutes for specific apps or output devices. It's clear by now that SoundSource has lots of great features under the hood, which is amazing for power users, but probably overkill for anyone who just wants to set separate volume levels for a couple apps. The good news is that SoundSource offers a free trial that lets you use all of its features for up to 20 minutes at a time, so you can try it out to see if it's worth buying.",

    "description": "Todolí foundation produces varieties from Buddha’s hands to sudachi and hopes to help citrus survive climate change",
    "fullText": "Todolí foundation produces varieties from Buddha’s hands to sudachi and hopes to help citrus survive climate change\n\nIt was on a trip with a friend to the east coast of Spain that Matthew Slotover came across the “Garden of Eden”, an organic farm growing citrus varieties he had never heard of. The Todolí Citrus Foundation is a nonprofit venture and the largest private collection of citrus in the world with more than 500 varieties, and its owners think the rare fruit could hold the genetic secrets to growing citrus groves that can deal with climate change.\n\nThe farm yields far more interesting fruit than oranges and lemons for Slotover’s menu, including kumquat, finger lime, sudachi and bergamot.\n\nThey grow everything completely naturally, and the groves have become a haven for frogs, goldfinches and bees.\n\nSlotover is the founder of Toklas in London, one of Nigella Lawson’s favourite restuarants. She recently raved about a dinner there that included langoustine and scallops with Rangpur lime and Spanish sweet limetta, and a “heavenly” guava roll with Shikuwasa mandarin.\n\nWhen Slotover visited the Todolí farm, he was awestruck. “It was like the Garden of Eden”, he said. “I just cannot tell you what the experience was like … I knew about oranges and lemons and limes and grapefruit. I didn’t know about tangelos and finger limes and citrons and pomelo.”\n\nHe tries to source most of the food on his European-inspired menu from the UK. “But citrus is too good to miss,” he said, during a visit to the Oxford Real Farming conference earlier this month. He teamed up with chefs to bring over some rare varieties from the farm, and they became so popular he passed distribution over to the organic food supplier Shrub, which sells them to chefs across London.\n\nFinger limes, also known as caviar limes, frequently feature on Slotover’s menu. They contain zesty pearls that burst in the mouth and have a fragrant sweet-and-sour flavour.\n\nThe citrus collection had no commercial purpose before the chefs discovered it. “When we first approached the owner Vincente [Todolí, the former Tate Modern director], he said: ‘We don’t really sell it. We give it to friends, we have an Italian guy who makes ice-cream with it.’ And what we’ve been doing with it since has been really helpful to the farm,” Slotover said.\n\nThe foundation’s technical director, Óscar Olivares-Fuster, said it operated differently to the commercial farms nearby.\n\n“Spain is the world’s largest exporter of fresh citrus,” he said. “We at Todolí do organic, we don’t use pesticides, we work with nature. Our climate, the cold nights, warm days and sea breeze help us with all our varieties, more or less.”\n\nRather than using artificial irrigation, which is water-intensive, they have learned from the ancient Arab practices and use irrigation ditches and ponds, which are not only attractive to look at but store water very well.\n\nThey have also created a haven for songbirds previously linked to Valencia’s citrus groves but which have been wiped out by herbicides and insecticides.\n\n“We have a bank of genes here, with hundreds of varieties of citrus. This is something unique to study,” Olivares-Fuster said. “Investigating these will be key for citrus to survive all the challenges that are coming, including climate change. Eventually, citrus will be grown north of the Pyrenees and we might struggle in the south.”\n\nOne of his favourite varieties to grow is the trifoliate orange. It is a small, very sharp fruit used mostly in jams and marmalades or as a substitute for lemon zest in recipes.\n\nHe said it was interesting because unlike other citrus varieties “it will shed its leaves in winter. This means it can be very resistant to cold”. Perhaps scientists could use this genetic trait to help other citrus varieties survive in colder climates, he suggested.\n\nThe farm grows 40 Japanese citrus varieties, including the Kiyomi tangor, but also the Valentine pomelo, a sweet fruit often grown in California. Chefs are keen on calamansi, a small, sour fruit originally from the Philippines, and the fragrant Borneo lumia.",

    "fullText": "January isn't over yet, and Amazon's already set to pay more than $3 billion to U.S. customers across various settlements. If you've bought anything from Amazon recently, keep an eye out: Bezos' baby could owe you some money.\n\nIf you've had difficulty returning an Amazon package recently, you could have a paycheck coming your way soon. As reported by Reuters, the company has agreed to a $309 million cash settlement (in addition to \"other benefits\") with affected customers, alongside more than $600 million in individual refunds. According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the settlement as a whole provides more than $1 billion in relief.\n\nThe lawsuit accused the e-commerce giant of causing \"substantial unjustified monetary losses\" with its return policies, which the plaintiffs say resulted in many customers returning items only to be charged for them anyway. Amazon denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but did say it will spend more than $363 million improving its return and refund practices.\n\nThe company claims that, after an internal review last year, it \"identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent to us, so no refund had been issued.\" However, Amazon said it had taken steps to resolve the issue, as seen in the refunds on years-old returns the company started issuing last year.\n\nThe settlement is still awaiting approval from U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle, but as both parties support it, it'll likely come soon. The class would cover \"U.S. purchasers of goods on Amazon from Sept 2017 who allegedly did not receive timely or correct refunds, or who were later charged despite returning items,\" writes Reuters.\n\nIt's currently unclear how class members would file a claim, or how the $309 million cash settlement and $600 million individual refunds will be divvied up. However, the plaintiffs told the court that class members should expect to recover the full amount of lost funds, plus interest.\n\nEligible class members are often contacted by email, so keep an eye out. In the meantime, you can also search for legal updates using the case name, \"In re: Amazon Return Policy Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, No. 2:23-CV-1372-JNW.\"\n\nWhile Amazon's returns settlement is still in its early phases, it's not the biggest payout the company's had to make this year. Earlier this January, Amazon reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC over accusations that it had essentially tricked people into either signing up for or staying subscribed to Prime. Claims are going out in two ways, one of which is automatic, and the other you have to \n\nAccording to the settlement website, as well as the FTC, automatic payments should have gone out already, and applied to people who meet the following requirements:\n\nYou are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025, and\n\nYou enrolled through a Challenged Enrollment Flow, and\n\nYou used no more than three Prime benefits in a 12-month period from June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025.\n\nIf that doesn't sound like you, or you didn't receive a payment, you'll need to file a claim using the \"File Claim\" button on the settlement website. You're eligible to do this if you meet the follow requirements:\n\nYou are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime, and\n\nYou unintentionally enrolled in a Prime membership through a challenged enrollment method at issue in the FTC’s lawsuit from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025; or you tried to cancel your Prime membership through the online cancellation process from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025, but were unable to do so; and\n\nYou used less than ten Prime benefits (e.g., delivery, shopping, streaming, reading, and other benefits provided to Prime members) during any 12-month period of enrollment in Prime, and\n\nYou did not receive an automatic payment as part of this Settlement already.\n\nNeither website is entirely clear about what constitutes \"challenged enrollment,\" aside from saying that Amazon enrolled customers in Prime without their knowledge or consent. Luckily, you probably won't need to do any legwork to see if you're eligible.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Amazon has begun sending claim notices by mail or email to eligible Prime customers who didn't already get an automatic refund. This will be your cue to If you believe you're eligible for a share of the settlement but Amazon did not contact you, you can reach out to [email protected] for help.\n\nOnce you file your claim, you can choose to be paid either through check, PayPal, or Venmo. Expected payments will differ from person to person, but will cap out at $51. And there's no need to rush. The deadline to file a claim is July 27, 2026, so you've got some time to ensure you get what you're owed.",

    "title": "Android Auto's Best Kept Secret Is a Programmable Shortcut",
    "description": "Run complex actions and routines with a single button press.",
    "fullText": "There's so much visual stuff you can customize in Android Auto. But Android Auto's capabilities go beyond aesthetics and the apps that pop up when you turn on the car. There's a hidden shortcut switch you can enable to run an action in the car that's programmed on your phone. No matter what car you're driving, if it has Android Auto, the shortcut is there.\n\nThis is the Custom Assistant Shortcut, and it's been part of Android Auto since early 2021. The feature is worth revisiting now that Gemini is slowly rolling out to replace the legacy Google Assistant on Android Auto. Gemini's natural language processing enables it to handle more complex routines, so you're not just programming a rote command you could have otherwise said out loud. The Custom Assistant Shortcut is labeled a \"secret\" feature because it's camouflaged beneath a main text label in the Android Auto settings menu. I didn't even think to look for it until I stumbled across the trick on an Android blog, but once you find it, it only takes a minute to set up.\n\nThere are several ways to configure the Custom Assistant Shortcut. For example, if you rely on the latest episode of a podcast to carry you through the morning commute, you could set up a shortcut to play the most recent episode via an app that plays well with Gemini, like Spotify or YouTube Music. I prefer to use the Custom Assistant Shortcut for a simpler sequence of actions: finding the nearest branded gas station, no matter where I am in my journey. I programmed the shortcut with the command \"Navigate to the nearest [branded gas station].\" This begins driving directions to the fuel station I specified, where I can count on adequate lighting and decent bathrooms. It's easier than pawing through the Google Maps app on the Android Auto screen, then looking for the sub-menu option that shows fuel stops, and then sorting through every single option within five miles when you select it. This version of the shortcut is also super helpful on road trips, especially solo ones.\n\nIf you're into home automation, this shortcut gets even more powerful. You can program a Google Home Routine so that a phrase triggers a domino effect of actions. Imagine a routine that prepares for your arrival by opening the garage door, disarming the security system, and turning on the lights before you've ever pulled into the driveway.\n\nYou don't need to be in your car to set up the Custom Assistant Action. On your phone, navigate to your Android Auto settings, then scroll down and tap on Customize launcher. Under the main heading, tap the smaller text that says Add a shortcut to the launcher. Select an Assistant action.\n\nFrom here, the most robust option is to write out a specific command. Something like \"Navigate Home,\" or \"Play the latest episode of [podcast title] on [media player].\"\n\nYou can take the shortcut for a spin in your car before hitting the road. The ability to test the command will pop up when you connect your phone to the car. You'll see your new shortcut appear in the app drawer as a standard app icon. It will have a small Gemini asterisk in the corner to distinguish it from native apps (it may still show the legacy Assistant icon in your phone's settings).\n\nThe \"Test Command\" button is on the same page where you set up the Custom Assistant Shortcut. Tap it, and you'll know your shortcut is working if the signature rainbow Gemini glow pulses at the bottom of the screen. If not, try adjusting the wording of your command and continue testing until it's a go.\n\nThese actions are tied to your Google account on your phone, so if you hop into another car with Android Auto, the button will follow you to the display. Remember that Gemini requires a stable data connection to process those requests. If you're driving through a cellular \"dead zone,\" the shortcut might hang, which is annoying while driving. If the shortcut is hard to find in the app drawer, remember you can return to the Customize Launcher menu in the phone's settings and reorder the shortcuts so they're at the top of the drawer.",

    "description": "Matching murders for complicated couples.",
    "fullText": "The first of a trio of Alice Feeney thrillers getting streaming series adaptations, His & Hers is a glossy, brisk and, perhaps most importantly, twisty Netflix mystery starring Tessa Thompson and Jon Bernthal. Thompson plays Annie Andrews, a has-been news reporter who decides to get back on the horse when she learns of a murder in her Georgia hometown. Bernthal is the local detective on the case and—surprise!—he's also her ex.\n\nHis & Hers is a big hit for Netflix, and a particularly buzzy and bingable example of the form. If you're looking for more of the same after finishing the last episode, here are a dozen more shows filled with zigzagging plots, complicated families, and women who are much more than mere victims.\n\nScandinavian cop drama (or Nordic noir, if you prefer) is its own sub-genre, so ubiquitous that the Disney+ show Agatha All Along did an episode parodying the form. Certainly The Åre Murders makes the case that Swedes know from murder. Plain-spoken, troubled (as in: under suspension) detective Hanna Ahlander leaves Stockholm to spend some time unwinding at her sister's place in remote Åre. A case involving a missing girl finds her back on the job, and up against local police officer Daniel Lindskog, who she's reluctant to trust. The dynamic isn't entirely dissimilar to that of reporter Anna Andrews and her cop ex in His & Hers. Looking for a bleakly beautiful landscape and ambiguous morality? Åre might be the place for you. You can stream The Åre Murders on Netflix.\n\nIn this adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel, Amy Adams stars as Camille Preaker, a troubled reporter with substance abuse issues who's only recently been released from a psychiatric hospital. I'm not sure what step of recovery involves returning to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri in order to investigate the murder of one girl and the apparently related disappearance of another—all under the watchful, critical eye of her socialite mother Adora (Patricia Clarkson). Like His & Hers, the plot turns a couple of gut-punch twists. Stream Sharp Objects on HBO Max.\n\nKate Winslet picked up an Emmy for her performance as thoroughly troubled Mare Sheehan, a local hero in her days as a high school basketball champ whose adult reputation is rapidly losing its luster. As a police detective, she's been unable to solve the case of a missing girl even as she's confronted with a recently murdered teenage mother—you probably won't be surprised to find that the cases are linked. Word on the street is that a second season might be in the works. Stream Mare of Easttown on HBO Max.\n\nThis twist-a-minute thriller stars Clare Danes as grieving mother and author Aggie Wiggs, who struggling with her next book, and decides to focus it on her neighbor, who was accused of murdering his first wife. What could go wrong? Matthew Rhys plays Nile Jarvis, the maybe-murderer neighbor, who gets caught up in the mix when Abbie's story becomes about way more than just one death. Stream The Beast in Me on Netflix.\n\nLiane Moriarty's novels have been adapted successfully in the past, from HBO's Big Little Lies to Hulu's Nine Perfect Strangers. Her work generally, and Apples Never Fall specifically, focuses more on mystery than thrills, but those twisty-turny plots are what we're here for. This miniseries follows the Delaney family, whose four siblings are forced to confront their dark family history following the disappearance of their mother Joy (Annette Benning)—a disappearance in which their father Stand (Sam Neill), is a person of interest. Stream Apples Never Fall on Peacock.\n\nThough a bit \n\nClara Merlo (Catalina Sopelana) is a medical resident in a big city hospital. One shift, she collapses, waking weeks later to learn that he heart failed and she's received a transplant. Though donors are anonymous, she decides that she really needs to know about the person whose heart she's walking around with—which is where we enter into \"What could possibly go wrong?\" territory. She manages to trace the donation to a family in the small town of Yesques, where she learns that the father of of her donor went missing years ago, while brother Juan (Alfons Nieto) has joined the police force. Good thing, too: she'll need his help when she winds up involved in a mystery that goes back two decades. Stream The Crystal Cuckoo on Netflix.\n\nThe first season ranked as Apple's most watched limited series ever, so naturally we're getting a second, based on another bestseller by Laura Dave. Jennifer Garner stars as Hannah Hall, a successful woodturner (now there's a new one in crime thrillers) trying to forge a bond with her stepdaughter in order to help solve the mystery of her missing husband. Stream The Last Thing He Told Me on Apple TV+.\n\nFollowing his wife's death, Yeong-ha (Kim Yoon-seok) just wants a quiet life in the secluded town where he lives—though he's not even all that enthusiastic about that. It's all going fine until a young woman shows up at the rental unit next door with her son, then abruptly vanishes, leaving behind blood stains and, even more disturbingly, the kid. This slow-burn, cinematic thriller has a storytelling structure that would be a spoiler to say too much about, but puzzing through it is definitely rewarding. Stream The Frog on Netflix.\n\nA distinctive police thriller imported from Spain, When No One Sees Us stars Mariela Garriga (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as a Cuban-American special agent of the U.S. Army, and Maribel Verdú (Pan’s Labyrinth) as a Spanish Civil Guard sergeant struggling with a complex home life. Both are investigating an apparent death by violent suicide on an air base during Holy Week. It's another complex mystery, but the performances and the emphasis on character over plot make it a standout. Stream When No One Sees Us on HBO Max.\n\nCreated, written, and directed by four-time Oscar winner Alfonso Cuarón, Disclaimer has as impressive a pedigree as you could hope for on streaming TV. Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline (both, incidentally, Oscar winners) star alongside Sacha Baron Cohen and Leila George. Blanchett plays Catherine Ravenscroft, an award-winning journalist who receives a mysterious manuscript—a novel in which she, herself, appears to be the main character, and which reveals secrets of her past that she thought were long buried. Stream Disclaimer on Apple TV+.\n\nThere's something to be said for each of the True Detective's four seasons, but Night Country moves away from the the sweaty bro energy of earlier seasons for a much frostier mystery involving missing scientists at a research station near a tiny Alaskan town, where the dark and the cold are practically characters themselves. The resulting mystery ties together veteran Chief Liz Danvers (Jodie Foster) and Trooper Evangeline Navarro (Kali Reis), two women with complicated pasts and screwed-up present family lives. The resolution to the mind-bending mystery drew a lot of debate, but the performances and chilly sense of magical realist dread are top tier. Stream True Detective: Night Country on HBO Max.",

    "fullText": "Drag gestures are far less common on the web than on mobile. I wanted to try how they feel on the web, so I built this iOS 26 inspired gesture with Motion as an exercise.\n\nDrag items to the left or right to see the interaction.\n\nIn terms of structure, the component is fairly straightforward. We start with the outer container and add overflow-clip which clips everything but prevents scrolling. Inside we have a div with the content that handles the gesture.\n\nFor the gesture, we will be using the drag prop from Motion. We start by defining the x value using the useMotionValue hook, where x is how far the draggable row shifts horizontally.\n\nMotion updates x continuously while you drag. You don't need to calculate distances manually.\n\nWe then pass the x value to the style prop of the motion.div and use drag=\"x\" to make the row draggable on the x-axis only.\n\nDrag the ball and change the modes to see the difference\n\nIn addition to setting up the drag gesture itself, you can also define its behavior.\n\ndragConstraints allows you to define the boundaries of the draggable area. In this component, we limit the draggable area to the left and right of the row.\n\nDrag the ball and toggle constraints to see the difference\n\ndragElastic controls the resistance when dragging past the boundaries. Lower values like 0.05 add very little overshoot, while higher values allow more before snapping back.\n\nDrag the ball past the boundary to see the elastic effect\n\nSetting dragMomentum to false removes the fling effect. For swipe actions, you want the row to stop where you decide, not where velocity decides.\n\nFlick the ball quickly and release to see the momentum effect\n\nWhen the drag ends, the row needs to snap to either left, right or center depending on the direction.\n\nBased on the x value when drag ends, we can determine the snap point. If you don't drag far enough, the row will snap to the center. If you cross the threshold, the row will snap to the nearest side.\n\nPOSITION_THRESHOLD is the commit point. Anything below it closes, anything above it opens.\n\nSetting dragMomentum to false is what makes this feel consistent. The row always lands on your snap points instead of overshooting based on velocity.\n\nThe original iOS gesture doesn’t reveal all actions at once. The first action appears first, the second one only when you drag past a certain threshold. The two thresholds I used are 44px and 88px.\n\nTo do this, compare the motion value against the thresholds.\n\nWe could also have this calculation be in percentages, but I like to keep it in pixels so I can easily tweak the values. We then use the isVisible prop to animate the button.\n\nIn addition to the drag gesture, there are a couple other animations in this component, with the first one being the indicators.\n\nWe render them conditionally, animate opacity and scale and wrap it in an AnimatePresence to handle the exit animation. Depending on where the indicator renders, we add a corresponding origin so it animates in from the correct direction.\n\nThe trash button uses a clip-path overlay and renders different trash icons and background colors depending on the state.\n\nI made a collection of buttons like these a while back.\n\nIn case you have any questions reach me at jakub@kbo.sk, see more of my work on Twitter or \n\nI share stuff that I'm working on, new posts and resources here.",

    "description": "New name, same problems.",
    "fullText": "On Monday, I was introduced to \"Clawdbot,\" the latest AI craze taking over tech social media channels. Clawdbot is designed to be an agentic personal assistant. In layman's terms, that means the bot can perform tasks on your behalf: You give it full access to your computer, and it can organize your inbox, code for you, or clear your calendar (allegedly, anyway). You can also talk to it from a chat app of your choice, like WhatsApp or iMessage, rather than it's own interface. Some people are even buying Mac minis exclusively to run Clawdbot from.\n\nIf you're wondering where that name came from, it takes after another AI company's product. Creator Peter Steinberger says he was inspired by the monster that appears when users reload Claude Code—Claude being one of the big AI products in the space right now, developed by the company Anthropic. Steinberger decided to go the lobster route with his logo, and named his own lobster mascot \"Clawd.\" From this, Clawdbot was born. The problem: Anthropic also calls Claude Code mascot \"Clawd.\" Whoops.\n\nAside from the name change, the bot appears to be the same as it was on Monday. That is to say, it's still open source, still available to run locally on your own device, and still comes with the same inherent security risks I outlined yesterday. I still wouldn't recommend you install a program like Moltbot on your personal device, since, name change or not, you'd still be giving it incredible access to your hardware and its data with little knowledge of the safeguards in place to protect it. All it could take is one malicious prompt injection for Moltbot to molt your security.",

    "fullText": "A deep dive into Trinity Large, covering architecture, sparsity, training at scale, and why we shipped Preview, Base, and TrueBase checkpoints.\n\nTwo months ago I wrote about why we decided to stop treating pretraining like someone else's job.\n\nAt the time, Trinity Nano Preview and Trinity Mini had just released, and Trinity Large had started training. We were in the middle of our first run so big that you either laughed or got nauseous. Frankly, I felt either we’d end up with a really great base model or fall flat on our faces with a tired wallet.\n\nLittle did I know, we’d get both.\n\nHere’s what we’re shipping, what surprised us, what broke, and what it took to make a 400B sparse MoE behave.\n\nWe're putting out three variants: Trinity-Large-Preview is lightly post-trained and chat-ready, Trinity-Large-Base is our best pretraining checkpoint after the full 17T recipe, and TrueBase is an early checkpoint from the same run at 10T tokens, without any instruct data or LR anneals. What many would consider a true base model.\n\nTrinity-Large is a 400B parameter sparse MoE with 13B active parameters per token. It uses 256 experts with 4 experts active per token. That sparsity ratio is pretty high compared to our peers, save for Llama-4-Maverick:\n\nWe originally aimed for a slightly different total size (420B), but we ended up increasing the number of dense layers (from 3 to 6) to help keep routing stable at this sparsity.\n\nTrinity-Large-Base is a true frontier-class foundation model. We match and exceed our peers in open-base models across a wide range of benchmarks, including math, coding, scientific reasoning, and raw knowledge absorption.\n\nWe trained on 2048 Nvidia B300 GPUs. As far as we can tell, it’s the largest (publicly stated, at least) pretraining run done on these machines. That means two things:\n\nTherefore, we had to make the most of the money we allotted to these machines, which was just over 30 days. Ridiculously fast for a run of this scale, so efficient training was the name of the game. Hence, the level of sparsity referred to above. Combined with our efficient attention outlined in our technical report, this enabled us to train and, by extension, run inference much faster than our peers in the same weight class. All while not sacrificing performance. Roughly 2-3x faster for the same hardware.\n\nWe keep MoE routing under control by nudging each expert’s router bias up or down depending on whether that expert is being over- or under-used. The update is capped with a tanh clip so it stays bounded, and we add momentum to smooth it across steps and avoid step-to-step ping-pong. On top of that, we include a small per-sequence balance loss so load is not only balanced in expectation across the batch, but also within individual sequences.\n\nWe use z-loss to stop the LM-head logits from drifting upward during training. It is a lightweight regularizer that keeps logit scale from creeping up without bound. We also log basic logit stats (for example max and mean) as a simple early warning for instability.\n\nThe exact equations are in the technical report.\n\nOur fastest configuration was HSDP with expert parallelism set to 8, which gave us 2048 data-parallel ranks. In that setup, we pushed throughput further by increasing batch size after 5T tokens of training. We were comfortable doing that because the model is highly sparse, Muon supports a larger critical batch size than AdamW, and the MiniMax-01 paper suggests batch-size scaling remains workable in this regime.\n\nIn the main run, once we had stability dialed in, the loss curve stayed smooth the whole way through. You can see clear phase transitions, no spikes, and a steady march to the end.\n\nThe full pretraining run finished in 33 days. That's pre-training only; it doesn't include context extension or post-training.\n\nTrinity Large was trained on 17T tokens of data curated by DatologyAI, split across three phases of 10T, 4T, and 3T tokens. This mix uses state-of-the art programming, STEM, reasoning, and multilingual data curation, targeting 14 non-English languages. Notably, over 8 trillion tokens of synthetic data were generated for this dataset across web, code, math, reasoning, and multilingual domains, using a breadth of state-of-the-art rephrasing approaches.\n\nA less advanced version of this curation approach worked well for smaller models like Trinity Nano and Trinity Mini, but we wanted to shoot for the moon with Trinity Large. So DatologyAI delivered a number of curation advancements specifically for inclusion into Trinity Large. There’s always a leap of faith when doing something for the first time in public, but the effectiveness of the curation approach as a whole is reflected in the downstream evaluations, where the Trinity Large-Base demonstrates frontier-level performance across the targeted capability domains.\n\nThe preview we’re releasing today is not a reasoning model. A benefit beyond production inference efficiency is that it also carries over into RL, enabling quicker rollouts for a given total parameter size. But it’s equally as sensitive as pretraining was, and while it’s currently undergoing further post-training and will be a full-fledged reasoning model upon release, we believe there’s a fine line between intelligence and usefulness, and while the reasoning variant is very intelligent, it needs longer in training before it becomes maximally useful given the extra tokens per output.\n\nAs such, to maximize usefulness and provide an early checkpoint, Preview is a non-reasoning, or “instruct,” model. It’s a particularly light post-training, as most of our compute went towards pre-training and is continuing with the reasoning version. It is an extremely capable model for its size and gave us the opportunity to flex some old-school post-training muscles we haven’t had the chance to flex in quite some time. It excels in creative writing, storytelling, role-play, chat scenarios, and real-time voice assistance, better than your average reasoning model usually can. But we’re also introducing some of our newer agentic performance. It was trained to navigate well in agent harnesses like OpenCode, Cline, and Kilo Code, and to handle complex toolchains and long, constraint-filled prompts. It certainly isn’t perfect, but we cannot wait to see what you do with it. It’s free in OpenRouter until Large (non-preview) fully releases.\n\nIt’s currently roughly in line with Llama-4-Maverick’s Instruct model across standard academic benchmarks, and we’ll update this blog over time with more evaluations.\n\nBut we like to tease, so I’ll leave you with some early evaluations of the reasoning Trinity-Large. These are not exhaustive, and by no means representative of the full capabilities of any of these models, but it is a fun look at how we plan to take this model.\n\nWhen we started this run, we had never pretrained anything remotely like this before.\n\nThere was no guarantee this would work. Not the modeling, not the data, not the training itself, not the operational part where you wake up, and a job that costs real money is in a bad state, and you have to decide whether to restart or try to rescue it.\n\nAll in—compute, salaries, data, storage, ops—we pulled off this entire effort for $20 million. 4 Models got us here in 6 months.\n\nThat number is big for us. It's also small compared to what frontier labs spend just to keep the lights on. We don't have infinite retries.\n\nOne more thing about Trinity-Large-TrueBase.\n\nMost \"base\" releases have some instruction data baked in. TrueBase doesn't. It's 10T tokens of pretraining on a 400B sparse MoE, with no instruct data and no LR annealing.\n\nIf you're a researcher who wants to study what high-quality pretraining produces at this scale—before any RLHF, before any chat formatting—this is one of the few checkpoints where you can do that. We think there's value in having a real baseline to probe, ablate, or just observe. What did the model learn from the data alone? TrueBase is where you answer that question.\n\nOpenRouter has Trinity-Large-Preview available now, free during the preview period (through at least February 2026). If you want to kick the tires without spinning up infrastructure, that's the fastest path.\n\nWe also worked with Kilo Code, Cline, and OpenCode to have integrations ready at launch. If you're already using one of those for coding, Trinity Large should show up as an option. This is an extremely young post-train, in the scheme of RL runs that go on for months at a time, like our peers. We’ll get there soon, but we’re oh-so-proud to have our own model to do it with. Expect rough edges, specifically in coding agents. For everyday agents, though, it’s outstanding.\n\nTrinity Large natively supports 512k context.\n\nThe preview API is running at 128k context with 8-bit quantization as we tune our inference infrastructure. This release is as much a preview of our hosting platform as it is a model launch.\n\nIf you put this model into something real and it breaks, tell us. The fastest way for open models to get better is for people to actually use them, hard, in places that don't look like benchmarks.\n\nWe like to say that we built Trinity so you can own it. Being able to say that about a frontier-level model is something we’re immeasurably proud of.",

    "fullText": "This is the concluding follow up to the article on ‘Arcan as Operating System Design‘. When combined, we have reach the end of trying to explain what Arcan actually ‘is’ on a higher level. After this we can revisit the topic in a first order form as ‘Implementation’.\n\nIn the first slides from the only public presentation (2015) we claimed that the idea behind Arcan was to find the crunchy middle between a display server, a game engine and a multimedia processor.\n\nThe control plane to this “desktop engine” was designed for a scripting API targeting entry-level developers. Lua remain as the weapon of choice for that role as a better follow up to the ‘BASIC’ of the home computer era, but also as an intermediate for other tools to compile to.\n\nTo make a long story short: That, my friends, is a browser; just average in a few areas, yet create something interesting out of orchestrated mediocrity — not unlike musical theatre.\n\nIn order to get anywhere on such a broad topic we will need to limit the scope a bit or we will be here all day. The web itself is as much, or more, social structures growing and evolving as a bacterium on a technological substrate than it is any singular piece of technology.\n\nEven if some cry out in doom and gloom about the dominance of Chrome ‘the browser’ (albeit also Chrome as Chrome OS and Chrome as Electron), do remember that it is still subject to other pieces like the server, the protocols, the app and the structural glue that is ‘the link‘. If you want to offset one part, you ought to consider how well it plays with the others as well.\n\nThis article will only focus on the technical side to the user facing access to this substrate. That is the browser software itself. An example of the makings of another ‘web’ to go with it, sponsored by NLnet (https://nlnet.nl/project/Arcan-A12/), is covered in ‘Arcan-a12: Weaving a Different Web‘ but it is architecturally loosely coupled.\n\nTo make things a little easier than what is normal around here, I will split it into a simplified ‘short form’ and as two heavier text sections.\n\nThe first section, Browser Breakdown, covers the problem space and some cherry picked history. The second, Arcan as Browser Design, goes into how we account for it.\n\nThe browser broken down is the end result of “the document” trying to envelop the computing world. The browser as proposed is “the desktop” trying to reach out.\n\nThe short form can be found here:\n\nTo demonstrate that this is existing technology, the presentation is also provided as an Arcan appl, viewable through “arcan-net arcan.divergent-desktop.org explain” (it is running on a potato used for active development).\n\nThat one happens to have been published a while ago. According to the logs, about two people have managed to find it. It seems there are lessons from the past about other meanings of “Search” that might be useful to rediscover now when more and more people and places alike are all llmpty on the inside and the noise floor is reaching the ceiling.\n\nSome suggested extended reading on the topics that will be covered here and in the next section:\n\nThe big question to unpack is if the browser is supposed to ‘present and navigate interlinked documents?’ in the spirit of the original much-too-simple hypertext, or be ‘an operating system agnostic substrate for networked applications’.\n\nLets start with a hypothetical speedrun through history.\n\nYou are back in the cosy times of the early 1990ies when computing was slow, storage was small and floppy disks got corrupted simply by staring at them for too long. You are struck with the brilliant idea of developing a software product that is supposed to just show very simple documents with formatted text in various typefaces, sizes and styles. Throw in the odd image or two. Maybe some media clip, but that can come later.\n\nThese documents should naturally be hosted and shared across networks of computers as that is faster and more convenient than copying things to floppy disks.\n\nIt turns out great with a lot of satisfied users that soon wants more. At the same time, windowing systems become more common. These force your simple document viewer to support moving things around to react to the window resizing. Users naturally want to handle different outputs, such as printers.\n\nThe documents these users have created started to form packs and people wanted ways for them to cross reference each-other and navigate these references with the click of a button. You oblige by adding ‘links’ to other documents and the option to open them in a new window.\n\nNetworks at this time are slow and servers are quite busy, so the next logical step would be some caching to make sure you only retrieve a linked document or its embedded images when something has actually changed.\n\nA ‘popular’ kind of document turned out to be ‘forms’ for people to fill out, print and post because those are like cocaine to governments and businesses alike. With that you add some way for the user to type into parts of these forms to fill them out before printing. This will save many from wasting time deciphering messy handwriting. Both throughput and accuracy improves greatly.\n\nStill people manage to fill them out wrong — to err is human and all that. It would save everyone time if you just add some easy way to have presets to chose from; a list box here and a radio box there. Soon enough every UI ‘widget’ imaginable has managed to join in, but you still think of it as a ‘document’ in the end.\n\nWhy even go through the pains of printing and posting? We can just sneak in some magic to POST the filled form as an e-mail or send it to the same place the document was hosted. Even better, we can embed some code to make sure that some of the inputs the user provides can be checked for errors locally and tell the user about any errors.\n\nIf something is made programmable, it follows that some crazy hacker kids will figure out creative ways to take advantage of this to do all sorts of unintended things. It did not take long before the documents started spawning little cats chasing the mouse pointer around.\n\nDocuments reshaping themselves as they were being viewed became the new normal. That is a big change in expectations for all stakeholders.\n\nYou should be able to see where this is going by now — It doesn’t take that many feature requests for a static document to become a dynamic application, similar to how few wrong turns it take to make a regular language grammar into a recursively enumerable one.\n\nTo keep up with new discoveries in everything from image compression to network communication lots of new code got written in order to support new media formats and more advanced protocols.\n\nThe easiest way to make software do new things is to add more code, and the path of least resistance is typically the one people follow. This is where software architecture matters and stops being just boxes and arrows on a whiteboard somewhere; it sets the constraints for how new code combines with the old.\n\nJust adding more code to solve for new features rather than refactoring to be more clever about things comes at a cost. More code means more potential bugs. Mix in economic incentives and some of those bugs turn into opportunities to exploit which calls for mitigation strategies.\n\nOne of the more potent ones are sometimes called sandboxing (a terrible term but that is another can of worms best left unopened) and comes with heavy requirements on security boundaries. Re-architecting to do that successfully is not for the faint of heart or light of wallet.\n\nIn the browser case, such a project comes with another interesting side effect: you are now compositing and routing inputs and outputs between a number of interactive sources and sinks across several privilege boundaries.\n\nThat is how you end up with something like this:\n\nCongratulations, you’ve made a display server with the weakest windowing system in town. Instead of leveraging the IPC system for better ways of collaborating with local software they stuck to crude left-overs from the outer windowing system like clipboards, drag and drop or, sigh, “portals”.\n\nA historically interesting tangent is that Microsoft was on this trajectory way back when and got close to a stronger solution through its COM/OLE/ActiveX path before falling into the antitrust trials pit (not that the idea went away).\n\nNow every few years there is some take on the “Java Applet” form of assimilation by forced cross compilation to an embedded executable format referenced from the document (which turns the document into a de-facto format for linking and loading yet with few of the insights embedded in proper executable formats) to target a virtual machine. Shockwave Flash being a notable one, and “WebAssembly” a more recent attempt.\n\nWhat if, instead of trying to regress towards “simple” in the browser domain (just to see the same story repeat itself) or in the data model (and still be stuck with the same browser story) – we assume the networked application endgame from the start and design for that?\n\nTo summarise the previous section – the browser started as linked documents breaking down into a networked application with ‘the document’ organically turning into ‘an executable format’.\n\nIn a spider graph form they went from this:\n\nThese are, of course, rough estimates. Improvements along each feature axis is exponentially more difficult and expensive.\n\nThe expected and required feature-space span the entire gradient:\n\nIt is worthwhile to note that it can transition from any point on the gradient to another. You get no guarantees about where you start, or if it will stay that way, unless you disable expected features with unpredictable results.\n\nWe can say the processing is iterative and the linking (as in program execution) is dynamic and mutable (events triggering code pulling in remote code hooking events).\n\nIn contrast, Arcan started at roughly this back in the early 2000s when hope was high and life worth living:\n\nThe processing looks like this:\n\nWe can say the processing is planar, static and recursive. With planar we mean that if there is a document stage, there is a discrete and decoupled transition from that into the app form. You know, a build system: compile, link/package, execute.\n\nThis means that the “as document” part of the runtime are separate tools not part of the browser itself. It only concerns itself with being an execution environment for the networked application. This keeps the browser part from having to walk an endless trail of outdated formats. Some are already conditioned to this approach with that of “static site generators”, it is just the output format that needs some change to move away from document to document translation.\n\nWith static it means that the compiled app is not capable of loading code outside of its own package, except for a set of preset helper scripts. This is the default with a user controlled opt-in rather than an opt-out as in “install extension to disable javascript”.\n\nWith recursive it means that navigating a link starts another instance of the browser that would either embed itself as any other data source in the parent, or take its place.\n\nThe emphasis on the display server aspect throughout the years here is no coincidence: it’s the weak-point of the dominant browser model and one that has very little documentation. It is also the reason why the apps developed and demonstrated here has mainly been desktop oriented — to politely point out that “you missed a spot”.\n\nChrome splits its app execution into a number of processes that are roughly “Network”, “Browser”, “UI”, “Storage”, “GPU”, “Device”, “Render” and “Plugin”. This is a logical breakdown of the internal division of responsibility. For privilege separation, each process role has a configured policy on which system resources it can access.\n\nArcan splits up its app execution into a number of processes by information transfer boundaries:\n\nThese come as a set of external clients that are picked for each instance – meaning that the supported formats, protocols and so on can be swapped out without any changes to the engine itself and per application basis. They are dependency and license “sponges”.\n\nTheir security model comes from a combination of least-privilege and capabilities. “Decode” is security wise the most sensitive one as that is where parsing of untrusted inputs go. “Encode” is privacy wise the most sensitive one as that is where the real ‘you’ distil into digital form.\n\nAfter the connection is setup, it needs no file system access at all. The system calls required match an OpenBSD pledge of “stdio sendfd recvfd” which is a hard surface to break through. Even then we have microarchitectural attacks to consider in the most hardened setups. This is where the ability to live-migrate any shmif client to a networked form comes in — you can compartment to cheap one-off devices like single board computers and the architecture still holds. Memory is never safe, wear a helmet.\n\nState store and list of permitted integrations with local software are in an SQLite database that is also picked for each instance. That local software can, of course, also be a different browser.\n\nThis becomes a hierarchy that looks like this:\n\nNot pictured here are the ‘hook-scripts’ facility which corresponds to ‘browser extensions’ in the web sense and the ‘developer tools’ sense.\n\nThe key component is the inter-process communication system (IPC). The one in Chrome, Mojo, is highly generic: an interface description language (IDL), a binding code generator and there you go. The qualities of the IDL limits what can be communicated and the binding generator affects the developer effort it takes to use. Part of the interface description links in ancillary specifications. An important one is the sandbox policy to apply.\n\nWe have seen it before: MIDL, CORBA, Fuchsia IDL, D-Bus, Wayland, Binder (AIDL) etc. ad nauseam. One may wonder how many generic ways we may need in order to eventually be specific.\n\nThe pitch for those are always ‘extendable / flexible’. I read that as ‘afraid to commit to anything’. It is a tempting model if you are unsure what you are supposed to be building (or organisation decoupling where you want formal barriers for communication between teams) and kick the bucket down the road. It is less tempting if there is ample history and plenty of examples to learn from.\n\nThe generic approach come at a cost. Code generated creeps into, or even dictates, the design of both sides and it ends up much bulkier and more verbose. It is rare for ancillary tooling support for debugging, report generation, testing, profiling etc. to be included.\n\nIn a previous life as a security auditor, a very successful path to victory was to locate any IDLs in use; patch to integrate fuzzing; deploy and wait for things to blow up. They typically do.\n\nThe IPC in Arcan, SHMIF, is highly specific. It is a lock-stepped data model with a C API. The message types and fields came from the needs of a full desktop OS, which has changed very little over the years. There is no reason to be clever, flexible or extendable. Just look at what others have done before and generalise from that. Validate against existing examples and use cases. Easy peasy.\n\nWhere we did put effort into being clever was two parts. Crash resilience and Alternate Representations.\n\nBoth are heavyweight topics in their own right, a dissertation or three, but for this context the motivation for resilience is easy enough – it allows us to redirect user workloads to relaunched instances (recovery), to others or other devices across the network (redirection) for collaboration or stronger security compartments, or to a future version of ourselves (upgrade).\n\nFor alternate representations, well we don’t all look at the world with the same eyes or desires now do we? The one that should be obvious is accessibility where the screen reader tradition is to snapshot composition state back into a document form and then navigate through voice synthesis and keyboard controls.\n\nA less obvious one is for debugging – be able to visually inspect and interact with the dynamics of the software rather than what it presents itself as. The other side of the same coin comes from malware reversing as that kind of work leverages the same kind of mechanisms. Process parasites (or as some call it, ‘Fileless malware‘) have been a thing for a very long time now, yet the generalised tools to shake them out have been sorely lacking for just as long.\n\nIn closing, there is a lot of technical detail that had to be omitted for this piece to not be completely indigestible but at the high level, there is not much more to say about the Arcan project as such. There are things left to do, but the end is in sight. Midnight draws near.",

He then went on to - and still has - an incredible career as a coach.\n\n\"I think his passion as a player transmits to the passion in his teams and obviously when I was younger watching Chelsea play in the manner that they did, defensively so strong.\n\n\"[Eden] Hazard was incredible in those moments, and he [Conte] has gone on to prove what an amazing manager he is and he's won many titles, including an incredible title here last year.\"",

    "fullText": "Approximately 80% of all Americans aged 60 and older are homeowners, and housing wealth accounts for about 48% of the median wealth of that group. As retirees near large cities, and strong housing markets, start retiring, they realize they can unlock this wealth by selling their home and relocating to a more affordable area. This retire-and-relocate strategy allowed homeowners to unlock a median figure of $99,019 from their homes in 2019 and the amount went up to $347,000 for the top 10% of homeowners who relocated to less expensive housing markets. Here’s how it works and the pros of cons of relying on this strategy for your retirement.\n\nConsider working with a financial advisor to help you with your retirement needs.\n\nHow Retirees Tap Into Housing Wealth By Relocating\n\nAs retirees finish working, they no longer need to remain within a close proximity to large cities like New York, Boston or Los Angeles. Instead, they are considering moves to more affordable states that are more retirement focused like Florida or Wyoming. This not only gives them a community of retirees to socialize with but it also is opening up a large chunk of their wealth through the sale of their home.\n\nVanguard recently conducted an analysis of this group to determine how much money retirees are unlocking by selling and relocating. As of 2019, the median homeowner who had reached the age of 60 and used this technique accessed approximately $99,000 in home equity. The top 10th percentile unlocked a median of $337,000.\n\nThe average homeowner who is at least 60 years old has about $223,000 of retirement savings in their financial accounts. That, alone, isn’t considered to be enough to retire on so many are starting to plan for the use of their home equity as part of their retirement plan.\n\nThe example provided by Vanguard looks at a woman who purchased a home near Boston in the 1990s for $170,000. That home would now have an approximate value of $500,000. After selling the home, relocating and buying a smaller home in her new location, she’s able to unlock about $200,000 on the capital gains from selling her house.\n\nThe key to unlocking these funds is that she must move to a location with a much more affordable housing market so that she doesn’t have to pay rent. This may not be an option for some who have family obligations tying them to their current location. However, for many this is quickly becoming a way to nearly double their retirement funds.\n\nTwo Types of Retirement Relocators\n\nThere are two types of retirement relocators that can find success with this strategy. The first is those who move from a booming housing market (lottery winners) and those who move to a low-growth housing market (bargain hunters). Each strategy creates different values for the homeowner but it also opens up different opportunities.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Jan 27 (Reuters) - With gold prices setting new all-time highs this week, customers have been cramming into stores in Shanghai and Hong Kong that sell the precious metal, with some betting the ​price could rise even further.\n\n\"There are still quite a lot of people buying it, because gold awareness is a long‑term trend ‌and it’s still heading upwards,\" gold seller Zhao Jinhao said on Tuesday at a jewellery mall in Shanghai.\n\n\"It’s risen from just over 20 yuan back in the 1980s to more ‌than a thousand yuan now, and it has been on an upward trajectory the whole time.\"\n\nGold prices surpassed $5,100 per ounce on Monday after a 62% surge in 2025. The record-breaking run has been propelled by central bank buying to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar and strong demand across the board from buyers looking for a safe-haven asset after the tumultuous first year of U.S. President Donald Trump's second presidency.\n\nAnalysts at Societe Generale said on Monday they expect ⁠to see gold reach $6,000/oz by year-end, a forecast ‌they said was conservative because prices could well go higher.\n\nSixty-eight-year-old Shanghai resident Wang Qiuqin appeared to agree, saying the \"crazy\" rise in prices had spurred her to visit a gold store to make a purchase.\n\n\"If this keeps up, gold ‍is still likely to go higher. I can still mentally accept the current price level, so I decided to come buy some.\"\n\nIn Hong Kong, Simon Littmann, the executive manager of Swiss Investors Corporation Limited, which trades in precious metals such as gold and silver, said business in January this year was his best ever in ​around 20 years in the trade.\n\n“Last year was probably our second-busiest year, and this year is looking to get very busy, but we ‌have supply problems,\" he said.\n\nThe supply of small gold bars has been delayed due to strong demand and as refineries around the globe rush to boost production of the products for the retail sector, he added.\n\nWhile many others are also not deterred — China's central bank bought bullion each month last year — higher prices are still having an effect on demand. Wholesale gold demand in China fell 11% last year as higher prices and reforms that raised taxes weighed on jewelry demand despite more interest in investment-style bars and coins.\n\nRecord prices are leading others to cash in. Dozens of ⁠people queued outside the door of the Chong Kee gold shop in Hong Kong’s ​central business district on Tuesday waiting for the chance to trade in gold and ​silver. Some had to wait hours to enter the premises, where they had trinkets like bracelets, necklaces, small statuettes and bars put onto scales to be weighed.",

    "fullText": "A snow leopard in China recently mauled a tourist who tried to get close enough to snap a photo of the rare animal.\n\nChina’s Forestry and Grassland Bureau said the tourist, who is a skier, was bitten on Friday, Jan. 23, in Koktokay town in China’s Xinjiang region, while returning to her hotel, CNN reported.\n\n“The general public and tourists are urged to strictly abide by the safety guidelines, maintain a safe distance when encountering wild animals, and report to the police immediately to ensure personal safety,” the forestry bureau said.\n\nMore animal attacks: An 'attack squirrel' has injured multiple people in California\n\nChinese broadcaster CCTV said the tourist spotted the snow leopard, got out of her car, and approached it to try to take photos before being attacked. According to CNN, the tourist was taken to a local hospital, where she remains in stable condition.\n\nVideo obtained by USA TODAY shows the chaotic moments following the tourists' mauling. In some clips, the snow leopard is seen standing over the mauled woman. After the snow leopard leaves the scene, fellow tourists appear to help the injured skier walk away.\n\nSnow leopards are among the most elusive creatures in the wild and have been afforded “first-class protection” in China after suffering from poaching, habitat loss and the effects of climate change throughout South and Central Asia, according to the Chinese magazine Sixth Tone.\n\nAccording to the Snow Leopard Trust, there are between 3,900 and 6,400 snow leopards left in the world, spread out in a range of 2 million square kilometers. The animals are usually solitary and highly active; however, they are not known to be aggressive to humans.\n\nTheir thick white-gray coat blends into its surroundings as these leopards live on high and rocky mountains, the Snow Leopard Trust said.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

    "description": "Scientists say grooves on a rock face overlooking the Adriatic Sea may have been made by sea turtles fleeing an earthquake.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nRock climbers in Italy stumbled across evidence of what appears to be a sea turtle stampede that took place nearly 80 million years ago. Now, new research suggests these ancient marine reptiles were fleeing an earthquake.\n\nThe climbers recognized the significance of their find because the grooves in the rock face on Monte Cònero overlooking the Adriatic Sea reminded them of others that had made headlines earlier that year. Those grooves had been found in another part of the same regional park and were attributed to a Cretaceous marine reptile pressing its paddles into the seafloor. They consulted with fellow-climber and geologist, Paolo Sandroni, who got in touch with Alessandro Montanari, director of the Coldigioco Geological Observatory (OGC).\n\nAfter an investigation into what these grooves might be, researchers revealed their findings in a study published Nov. 19 in the journal Cretaceous Research.\n\nSandroni and another member of the team climbed back to the area to collect rock samples and document the site using a drone.\n\nHundreds of these tracks are located on a layer of the Scaglia Rossa limestone in Cònero Regional Park, a formation that has been extensively studied for decades and preserves millions of years of deep sea sedimentation, study co-author Montanari told Live Science.\n\nWhat is now part of a mountain was once a deep seabed folded over and thrust upward by tectonic forces millions of years ago, he said. Rock samples collected immediately above the tracks and analyzed by the team reveal important clues about the tracks’ location and the story behind them. For example, they suggest the sea turtles lived around 79 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous Period and indicate that the limestone was part of an underwater avalanche of mud triggered by an earthquake.\n\nAbundant seismic activity in this formation is also supported by decades of collective study. Thin sections slides of the rock samples reveal microfossils of organisms that live along the seafloor, suggesting a hundreds-of-meters deep seafloor environment.\n\nNormally, any traces left by animals would be erased by currents at the sea bottom and \"worms, clams and [other] benthic organisms,\" Montanari said. \"They basically garden the seafloor,\" he noted. But an earthquake caused an underwater avalanche within minutes of the tracks being made, preserving them, he said.\n\nThe only vertebrates big enough to make these tracks in the Late Cretaceous were marine reptiles such as sea turtles, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs. The latter two are believed to have been largely solitary, but, if ancient sea turtle behavior mirrored that of some of today's species, the researchers said, then it is possible they may have foraged near shore or left the water to lay their eggs. Whatever brought them together, an earthquake caused them all to flee at once, the team suggested in the study, forcing some of the turtles to swim in the water above toward the open sea, and others to scurry away closer to the deeper seafloor. The impending underwater avalanche propelled them even further out of the way.\n\n—Titanic 12-foot turtle cruised the ocean 80 million years ago, newfound fossils show\n\n—Giant 'cow of the Cretaceous' discovered almost 100 years ago identified as new duck-billed dinosaur\n\n—Ancient mummified cheetahs discovered in Saudi Arabia contain preserved DNA from the long-lost population\n\nMichael Benton, professor of vertebrate palaeontology at the University of Bristol in the U.K., who was not involved in the research, said the study clearly shows the geological context, but he questioned which animal made the tracks.\n\n\"The tracks are unusual because they seem to show underwater punting, where the two forelimbs enter the sediment together and the animal pushes forward,\" he told Live Science. Most vertebrates tend to “walk or swim with the limbs out of sequence” rather than putting two limbs down at the same time, he said. \"Marine turtles generally have a very efficient swimming mode,\" he said, “a bit like underwater flying, where the front paddles swing round” similar to a figure eight pattern, which doesn’t appear to match the tracks found. He also questions why they wouldn't simply \"leave the sea bed and swim\" away.\n\nMontanari said that while the prints would benefit from further research, it is clear, geologically, that there was an underwater avalanche triggered by an earthquake. He said he hopes their work will prompt fossil experts to further study the site.",

I know what we did and didn’t do for these (expletive).”\n\nBongino then cited a New York Times article, which included interviews with several current and former employees who accused Director of the FBI Kash Patel of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge. Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country,\" Bongino said.\n\nBongino said the media is a “big, full diaper,” adding that he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity then commented by saying that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” observing he was more restrained when he held a government title.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”\n\nSuffolk DA on Minneapolis: ICE’s, Border Patrol’s tactics ‘threaten citizens everywhere’\n\n‘Nasty profession’: Trump reveals why he skewers people in public he thinks are ‘nice’\n\nTrump calls vocal critic ‘incompetent’ as 2028 presidential race heats up\n\nMass.

    "fullText": "A professional python hunter in Florida needed assistance from family members to uncoil a giant Burmese python from his body and to ultimately subdue the second-heaviest python ever caught in Florida.\n\nCarl Jackson, who is a contracted python hunter with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, was traveling back on Turner River Road in Big Cypress National Park in the afternoon on Jan. 13 when he noticed Burmese python tracks across the road over his truck tracks, as reported by Naples News.\n\nThey appeared to be tracks from a smaller snake, perhaps an 8-footer, tops.\n\n“I go in [to the bushes] and walk around and I see a head,” Jackson told Naples News.\n\nHe immediately recognized that this was not a small snake.\n\nJackson began wrestling with the huge python, which dragged him an estimated 10 to 15 feet over a red and black ant hill.\n\n“It was like riding a slow horse,” Jackson, 43, told Naples News.\n\nJackson relied upon his team to uncoil the snake from around his body several times. His team included his wife, Tasha, and adopted kids, Ryker Young, 20, and Jazzlyn Bateman, 16, all of whom just the day before became certified assistants in the FWC’s Python Action Team, Removing Invasive Constrictors program.\n\nThe python wound up being the second-heaviest python ever caught in Florida at 202 pounds. The record is 215 pounds caught in 2022.\n\nJackson’s python was a 16-foot, 10-inch female, which had been carrying 200 eggs.\n\nAlso on FTW Outdoors: Woman awakes to find python on her chest, ‘don’t move’\n\n“That means more to me because that is 200 potential deer and native animal eaters [that were eliminated],” Jackson told Naples News.\n\nSince moving from Utah to hunt pythons last year, Jackson has eliminated 91 pythons, including the longest one among the contracted hunters in 2025—a 17-foot, 10-inch python.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Python drags hunter 15 feet over ant hill; ‘like riding a slow horse’",

    "description": "A “vulnerable” young man with no terminal illnesses has died by euthanasia in Canada.",
    "fullText": "A “vulnerable” young man with no terminal illnesses has died by euthanasia in Canada.\n\nKiano Vafaeian, 26, had type 1 diabetes, partial blindness and depression, but was approved for the government euthanasia scheme despite his mother Margaret Marsilla’s protests.\n\nShe said his death on Dec 30 was “disgusting on every level”, having previously prevented him from dying under Canada’s Medical Assistance in Dying (MAid) programme in 2022.\n\nMs Marsilla only learned of her son’s appointment from a text he sent the family the day before his death, during an apparent improvement in his mental health.\n\nAlthough people with a chronic illness or disability qualify for assisted dying in Canada, Ms Marsilla believes doctors took advantage of his depression.\n\nShe wrote in a social media post earlier this month: “This is not healthcare. This is a failure of ethics, accountability, and humanity.\n\n“No parent should ever have to bury their child because a system – and a doctor – chose death over care, help or love.\n\n“I promise I will fight tooth and nail for my son, and other parents who too have children that suffer from mental illness.”\n\nEuthanasia was introduced in Canada in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with serious and incurable physical illness that causes intolerable suffering.\n\nIn 2021, the requirement to be terminally ill was removed to include people with a chronic illness or disability.\n\nThe widening of eligibility has led to a surge in deaths, experts say, triggering fears of a similar increase in the UK, where a bill on assisted dying is being debated in the House of Lords.\n\nCanada now has one of the highest rates of assisted dying in the world, accounting for one in 20 of all deaths in the country in 2024, government figures show.\n\nIn 2027, the government plans to extend the programme to those with mental illnesses, who have no physical ailment.\n\nIn September 2022, Ms Marsilla had discovered that her son had been scheduled for physician-assisted dying. The then 23-year-old had recently lost vision in one eye, had no job, and no plan for the future.\n\nAfter she raised awareness about the planned procedure online, the doctor received backlash and refused to carry out the procedure. Vafaeian said his mother had violated his right to choose how and when he wanted to die.\n\n“He was alive because people stepped in when he was vulnerable – not capable of making a final, irreversible decision,” Ms Marsilla said of the incident.\n\nShe also claims Vafaeian’s mental health was improving before his death. She said he had agreed to accept financial support from her, was saving money for them to travel together, and had done personal training sessions.\n\n“He was so happy that he was working out and getting healthy,” she said.\n\nOn Dec 15, Vafaeian flew to a luxury resort in Mexico, before checking out two nights later and flying to Vancouver. On Dec 29, he texted his family saying he was scheduled to die the next day.\n\nMs Marsilla said that she planned to pursue accountability from her son’s MAiD doctor, who she claimed had managed to find a loophole in the system and had “approved his death based on mental illness”, despite it not yet being legal.\n\nVafaeian’s death certificate listed the “antecedent causes” as blindness, severe peripheral neuropathy (damage to nerves that causes pain and numbness), and diabetes.\n\nDespite a host of Western countries legalising assisted dying, including Australia, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, the issue remains deeply divisive on ethical, religious and legal grounds.\n\nThe key debate centres around how to balance personal autonomy with the protection of vulnerable people.\n\nBritish medical bodies have raised significant concerns about the definition of “terminal illness” and safeguards to prevent coercion in the current bill. In November, a poll found more medical professionals oppose than support the draft legislation.\n\nThe fastest growing category of Canada’s assisted dying is not those with a terminal illness, but those labelled “other”.\n\nSonu Gaind, a University of Toronto psychiatry professor, told the Free Press that MAiD deaths registered in the “other” category in Canada nearly doubled between 2022 and 2023 to 4,255.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "CBS News boss Bari Weiss told staffers they are not putting out enough content that appeals to Americans — while also sharing her strategy to grab more viewers and readers — during an internal town hall meeting on Tuesday.\n\nCNN’s Brian Stelter posted her comments on X. Weiss was frank in her assessment of her team, saying CBS News can only improve after “honestly” looking at its own work — which she is not overly impressed with so far.\n\n“We are not producing a product that enough people want,” Weiss said.\n\nShe continued, “We can blame demographics or technology or fractured attention spans or ‘news avoidance’ — but these are all copes.”\n\nHere, in three posts, are the written remarks by Bari Weiss at today's CBS News town hall meeting. Part one of three: pic.twitter.com/sLxfVeFkVW\n\n— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 27, 2026\n\nWeiss said she has been “blown away” by many of her reporters recently, including Matt Gutman’s work covering anti-ICE protests in Minnesota.\n\nBut she said there are two main issues facing CBS right now, with the first one being that not enough people “trust” the outlet or other mainstream shops in general. The polling backs up her claim, with Gallup reporting the American public’s trust in the news dropped to an all-time low in 2025.\n\nThe second issue is CBS is not “doing enough to meet” viewers and readers where they are, Weiss said.\n\nShe said the CBS strategy up until she arrived was to “cling” to its dwindling broadcast audience. Weiss said that cannot be the case moving forward, or CBS News will be “toast.”\n\nStarting immediately, Weiss wants CBS News to focus on how it can better promote stories on YouTube and emphasize streaming. “We need to shift to a streaming mentality immediately,” she said.\n\nA moment later, she told her crew:\n\nAs we move forward, we are not competing primarily for ratings but for audience share. Our competitors are not just the other broadcast networks. We are competing for the attention of anyone in front of a screen.\n\nHer streaming-focused game plan comes after CBS News finished third in the nightly news battle last year. Weiss recently picked Tony Dokoupil to spearhead its revamped CBS Evening News; his first week as anchor failed to boost ratings earlier this month, but his January 19 broadcast pulled in 6.4 million viewers — which was the best night for the program since 2021.\n\nThe post Bari Weiss Bluntly Tells CBS News Staff ‘We Are Not Producing a Product Enough People Want’ in Blistering Internal Town Hall first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but distanced herself",
    "fullText": "TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but ​distanced herself from previous comments that suggested a possible military response in such an event.\n\nTakaichi expressed ‌her latest views on a nationally broadcast TV programme late on Monday, where an opposition party leader criticised her for igniting ‌tensions with China with the earlier remarks.\n\nTies between Japan and China have sunk to the worst level in years after Takaichi said in November that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. Beijing has responded with export curbs, flight cancellations and vitriolic commentaries, repeatedly demanding a retraction.\n\nChina claims sovereignty ⁠over the democratically-governed island of Taiwan.\n\n“I ‌want to make it absolutely clear that this is not about Japan going out and taking military action if China and the United States come into conflict (over ‍Taiwan),\" Takaichi said on the live TV show, referring to the comments she made in parliament in November.\n\n\"If something serious happens there, we would have to go to rescue the Japanese and American citizens in Taiwan. In that situation, ​there may be cases where we take joint action.\n\n\"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, ‌come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nJAPAN'S CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS DIRECT MILITARY ACTION\n\nWith an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the ⁠remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with ​Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of ​her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Japan to \"earnestly reflect and correct its mistakes, and to stop its manipulation and reckless actions on ‍the Taiwan issue.\"\n\nJapan's pacifist constitution ⁠prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces ⁠a \"threat to its survival.\"\n\nTakaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election ‌on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.",

    "fullText": "Members of a motorcycle club and a street gang clearly targeted an Indiana judge for assassination, police said Tuesday, days after officers arrested five people in connection with the attack.\n\nPolice and prosecutors at a news conference praised what they characterized as a relentless effort to track down who opened fire on Tippecanoe County Superior Court Judge Steven Meyer and his wife, Kim, at their home in Lafayette on Jan. 18. Both Meyer and his wife suffered gunshot wounds but survived.\n\nThe Lafayette Police Department, the FBI, the Indiana State Police and the Purdue University Police Department launched a search for the shooter that went on for days before apprehending five people in synchronized arrests Thursday evening, including four in Indiana and one in Lexington, Kentucky. Court appearances for the suspects were set for Wednesday in Indiana and Kentucky.\n\n“This attack was more than an assault on two citizens,” LaFayette Police Chief Scott Galloway said. “This was an assault on the rule of law itself.”\n\nProsecutors allege that the attack was designed to derail a domestic abuse case against Thomas Moss, a member of the Detroit-based Phantom MC motorcycle club with ties to the Vice Lords street gang.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, the Vice Lords offered the victim in the case $10,000 not to testify against Moss but she refused.\n\nWith Moss' trial set to begin on Jan. 20 in front of Meyer, another Phantom MC member, Blake Smith, purchased a shotgun. A masked man traveled to the Meyers' home armed with that shotgun on Jan. 18. He lured the couple to the door by saying he was looking for his dog, shot them through the door and fled.\n\n“(Meyer) was targeted,” Indiana State Police Lt. Col. Al Williamson said at Tuesday's news conference. “They went after him for a reason.”\n\nPolice recovered the mask, the shooter's clothing and the shotgun discarded near the Meyers' home. DNA on the mask matched Raylen Ferguson, an associate of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation from Lexington, Kentucky, according to the affidavit.\n\nSurveillance video showed a car that was parked near the Meyers' home had traveled from Kentucky toward Lafayette on Jan. 16 and traveled toward Smith's residence in the hour after the shootings, according to the affidavit.\n\nMoss, Ferguson and Smith each face multiple charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Amanda Milsap, whom prosecutors allege offered the bribe in the domestic abuse case, faces bribery and obstruction counts. Zeneda Greer, a woman Ferguson lives with, has been charged with helping a criminal and obstruction. Prosecutors have accused her of traveling to Lafayette with Ferguson.\n\nMilsap's attorney, Earl McCoy, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Online court records did not list attorneys for Moss, Ferguson or Blake. Jail records indicate Greer is being held in Lexington. Online court records in that state did not list an attorney for her.",

    "fullText": "Ray Dalio warned the U.S. stands “on the brink” of transitioning from Stage 5 pre-breakdown to Stage 6 systemic collapse as Bitcoin is trading defensively at $88,000, trapped in a 60-day range by record institutional selling pressure from American counterparties.\n\nThe billionaire investor’s latest analysis of the “Big Cycle” coincides with Bitcoin’s failure to live up to its “digital gold” narrative, while traditional safe havens surge to all-time highs.\n\nDalio’s framework identifies bankrupt government finances and wealth gaps as the “single most reliable leading indicator of civil war or revolution,” conditions he argues now characterize American reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Wintermute’s desk reports that Bitcoin remains stuck between $85,000 and $94,000 as U.S. spot ETF products hemorrhage capital and the Coinbase premium trades at a persistent discount, indicating that domestic institutions are driving bearish momentum.\n\nDalio’s long essay positions current American conditions within Stage 5 of his Big Cycle framework, where “bad financial conditions and intense conflict” precede systemic breakdown.\n\n“We are now clearly on the brink of crossing from Stage 5 (pre-breakdown) to Stage 6 (breakdown),” he wrote, pointing to unsustainable debt loads that force governments to either “print a lot of money, which depreciates its value” or implement painful austerity.\n\nThe analysis comes as Bitcoin trades range-bound for 60 consecutive days, an unusual pattern for an asset class often marketed as protection against exactly the monetary debasement Dalio describes.\n\nGold climbed above $5,066 per ounce on Tuesday while silver surged 6.4% to $110.60, both setting fresh records as investors sought traditional inflation hedges.\n\nDalio warned that “later stages may involve capital controls, reserve freezes, and cross-border restrictions, turning funds into political tools,” conditions that typically favor “freely transferable assets” and investments “prioritizing resistance to freezing and blockades.“\n\nBitcoin proponents have long argued that crypto fits this profile, yet the asset has failed to attract safe-haven flows amid elevated macro uncertainty.\n\nWintermute’s OTC desk identified American selling pressure as the primary force keeping Bitcoin suppressed within its trading range.",

Kendall is the father to three of the four children.\n\nElleshia was arrested in Dubrovnik, about 400 miles from the Croatian capital of Zagreb, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed to DNEVNIK, a leading local news agency, on Monday, Jan. 26.\n\nAnother local outlet, 24 Sata, also reported on the arrest, citing a statement from the ministry, although the ministry did not name the woman in its statement.\n\nElleshia was arrested in connection with a criminal case involving violation of the rights of a child, the outlets reported.\n\nPEOPLE has reached out to the ministry as well as the U.S. embassy in Croatia for confirmation.\n\nThe children's alleged abduction came to light following a welfare check on Dec. 2, when West Jordan Police Department arrived at Elleshia's residence and found it unoccupied and unlocked, ABC4 Utah previously reported, citing court records.\n\nElleshia, who shares custody with the fathers of her children, allegedly feared it was the “end of times” and had concerns of \"biblical events,\" a former boyfriend previously told KSL Utah.\n\n“I didn't really know anything about her end-of-times beliefs until after this all happened,” ex-husband Kendall further told the outlet. “It didn't come up in our marriage or after our divorce.”\n\nIn the GoFundMe, Kendall alleged that Elleshia \"left behind a note dictating a delusional message from God promising her she would be in Italy by Christmas, and a to-do list that mentioned 'shred paperwork, destroy identifying photos, throw away phone, purchase pre-paid phone.'\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the children have been removed from the orphanage.\n\nDespite Kendall's online pleas to return the children back to the U.S., the Croatian Institute for Social Work has called for a thorough review of the case, 24 Sata, DNEVNIK and Teleskop reported.\n\n\"Given the international element of the case, it is essential that the competent authorities of the United States of America conduct a review of all relevant facts and circumstances before making a decision to hand over the children to the father,\" the institute said in a statement.\n\nPEOPLE has reached out to the institute for comments.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nIn Utah, Elleshia is facing four counts of custodial interference, local authorities said, per KSL and ABC4 Utah.\n\nWhile the case began with the West Jordan Police, it was transferred to the FBI. Both the FBI and West Jordan police declined to comment on the investigation.\n\nThe case is now being passed on to Croatian police, local officials further told KSL. It wasn't immediately clear if the FBI is still investigating.\n\nOther entities, such as Croatia's foreign affairs office, the U.S. consulate in Croatia, and the Utah Department of Public Safety, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comments.\n\nKendall is seeking further donations on GoFundMe to help him cover travel costs while continuing to stay in Croatia as he tries to release the children.\n\nIf you suspect child abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or 1-800-422-4453, or go to www.childhelp.org.
