    "fullText": "Mike Macdonald’s Seahawks face their defining defensive test in Super Bowl LX originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are headed to Super Bowl LX after outlasting the Los Angeles Rams 31-27 in the NFC Championship Game, setting up a title matchup with the New England Patriots.\n\nFor head coach Mike Macdonald, the moment carries historical weight. At 38, he has a chance to become the third-youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl, joining Sean McVay in 2021 and Mike Tomlin in 2008, who both lifted the Lombardi Trophy at age 36.\n\nThe game also pits Macdonald against Patriots coach Mike Vrabel, both seeking their first Super Bowl victory as head coaches. Vrabel brings a championship pedigree from his playing days, having earned three rings as a linebacker in New England.\n\nMacdonald, meanwhile, is only in his second season leading Seattle, making the Seahawks’ run all the more striking.\n\nGeneral manager John Schneider is chasing a milestone of his own. A victory would give him a second Super Bowl title with the franchise, this time achieved after reshaping the roster and installing a new coaching staff.\n\nTogether, Schneider and Macdonald have already overseen the most successful regular season in team history, finishing 14-3 and securing the NFC's top seed. That résumé now frames Super Bowl LX as both a reward and a proving ground, particularly for a defense that must rediscover its edge.\n\nSeattle’s path to the Super Bowl was not without warning signs. Against the Rams, the Seahawks defense surrendered 8.3 yards per play, its worst showing of the season, and allowed 26 first downs, tying a 2025 high.\n\nLos Angeles gained more total offense than Seattle had given up to San Francisco across the previous two games combined, testing a unit that had been among the league’s most reliable.\n\nMatthew Stafford capitalized, throwing for 374 yards and three touchdowns without an interception. Kyren Williams and Blake Corum each averaged five yards per carry, further exposing breakdowns up front.\n\nSeattle managed just one sack and three quarterback hits, while the Rams produced three sacks and seven hits of their own, tilting the line-of-scrimmage battle.\n\nThose numbers stood in contrast to a regular season defined by control. Under Macdonald, the Seahawks allowed only 17.2 points per game, limited opponents to a league-low 3.7 yards per rush, and went 26 straight games without giving up a 100-yard rusher.\n\nThat performance earned Macdonald NFC Coach of the Year honors at the 101 Awards and put him in contention for the Associated Press Coach of the Year, to be announced during Super Bowl week.\n\nThe Rams game suggested that philosophy alone may not be enough in February. Seattle typically relies on pressure without heavy blitzing, but adjustments could be necessary against New England. Whether the Seahawks can pair their season-long discipline with timely tactical changes may ultimately decide Super Bowl LX.\n\nHow many Super Bowls have the Rams won?

    "description": "The Lakers continue their eight-game road trip in Cleveland. Here's your all-Lakers preview.",
    "fullText": "Lakers (28-17) vs. Cavs (28-20) | Game 46 of 82\n\nLocation: Rocket Arena—Cleveland, Ohio\n\nThe Lakers continue their largest road trip of the season in their fifth straight road game, taking on the Cavaliers for the first time this year.\n\nThe Cavs have been hot as of late, coming in on a four-game win streak and a huge 16-point win over the Magic on Monday. Cleveland has won seven of their last eight games and hold a 16-11 record at home.\n\nThe Lakers are coming off two straight road wins against Dallas and Chicago, who both had won four straight games going into their matchup against Los Angeles. They can continue that trend with a win in Cleveland.\n\nThe Lakers are 3-1 on the road trip and have won four of their last five games. The Lakers are coming off an all-around 11-point win over the Bulls on Monday behind Luka Dončić notching 46 points on a season-high eight 3s.\n\nDončić had arguably his best outing passing the ball as well, with multiple Magic-Johnson-like passes on his way to 11 assists on the night. It was the 23rd time this season he finished with a double-double and the eighth time he had over 40 points.\n\nThe Lakers -- who sit fifth in the West at 28-17 -- will be tested against a depleted Cavs team that sit fourth in the East with a 28-20 record. The Lakers are 10-9 this season against teams over .500.\n\nCleveland’s offense is spearheaded by Donovan Mitchell, who is having an elite All-Star season, averaging 29.5 points per game for fifth most in the NBA, while also leading the team in assists (5.8) and steals (1.5). Mitchell has led the Cavs in scoring in eight of the last 10 games and is coming off a 45-point showing against the Magic.\n\nSo we will see a clash of Dončić and Mitchell in Cleveland. FUN!\n\nWith Darius Garland set to miss his seventh consecutive game due to a right great toe sprain, Mitchell will continue to be the Cavs’ primary scorer and facilitator. Jaylon Tyson has been an emerging young talent in place of Garland with 14 ppg and a team-high 46% shooting from 3 in 28 starts this season.\n\nThe Cavaliers will also be without Evan Mobley, who is expected to miss at least one week with a calf injury, removing a key interior presence on both ends of the floor. In his absence, Jarrett Allen (13.3 points, 7.8 rebounds) becomes the focal point in the paint against Deandre Ayton, while Cleveland leans more heavily on wing depth and Mitchell’s shot-making to generate offense.\n\nDespite the injuries, the Cavs are fourth in the NBA in scoring, but the absences of Garland and Mobley significantly alter their offensive balance and defensive identity.\n\nNOTABLE OPPONENT RANKS AMONG THE NBA\n\nThe Cavs have the 9th-rated offense (116.4) and the 12th-rated defense (113.8) in the NBA. Here are their notable rankings this season:\n\nAustin Reaves (left calf strain): Out\n\nAdou Thiero (right MCL sprain): Out\n\nDe’Andre Hunter (right knee): Probable\n\nSam Merrill (right hand): Probable\n\nLuke Travers (hamstring): Day-to-day\n\nThe Lakers will wear their gold uniform on the road, while the Cavs will wear their navy blue 2007 alternate jersey.\n\nThe Lakers will continue their eight-game road trip in Washington on Friday against the Wizards.",

    "fullText": "Speaking to The Italian Football Podcast this week, former Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna argued that fellow full-backs Riccardo Calafiori and Jurrien Timber are the best recent signings the club have made.\n\n“I think Calafiori probably with Timber is the best recruit Arsenal have had for a long time, because they are reliable, and they can play many positions,” Sagna said.\n\n“They’re quite versatile, and Mikel can count on them. They always put in a shift, they always deliver a good performance, and if you want to be champions, sometimes maybe you can have more exciting players, faster players, but these are the type of players that can make you win the league.”\n\nIn terms of their levels of performance, Timber and Calafiori are certainly among Arsenal’s most consistent players. It’s hard to think of many poor displays between the two of them combined over the last 12 months.\n\nThe issue both have had since joining Arsenal is staying fit. Timber obviously missed almost his entire first season at the club with an ACL injury, whilst Calafiori has been in and out of the team with various setbacks since joining.\n\nTo emphasise that point, ahead of Wednesday night’s game against Kairat Almaty, Calafiori looks set for his first appearance back after a nine-game absence, whilst Timber has been ruled out with a minor knock.\n\nBoth in terms of the statistics and what you can see with your eyes when they’re on the pitch, Calafiori and Timber are undeniably among the best in the Premier League at what they do.\n\nThe challenge is just getting them out there consistently in the big games, when Arsenal need them available.",

    "title": "Bill Belichick snub makes it harder for Mike Holmgren to reach Hall of Fame",
    "description": "How does Bill Belichick get left out of the Hall of Fame on the first ballot? It has a lot to do with the process itself.",
    "fullText": "The stunning report that Bill Belichick won't be among the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class, officially announced Feb. 5, comes with an interesting byproduct for those following the Green Bay Packers; it appears to make things harder for Mike Holmgren to make the cut.\n\nIf nothing else, it likely delays Holmgren's next opportunity by another year, since it stands to reason that Belichick will be the single \"coach\" candidate forwarded out of committee yet again in 2027. And, though some parts of the process are opaque, it may even speak to the difficulty of reaching the Hall of Fame as a coach at all, at least under the current process guidelines.\n\nIn the two years since the Hall of Fame modified its selection process to the current format, none of the coach finalists (Buddy Parker, Holmgren, Belichick) have received the necessary votes required from the 50-person Hall of Fame selection committee to merit induction.\n\nHolmgren led the Packers to two Super Bowls and helped rebuild the franchise into a powerhouse, then led the Seahawks to another Super Bowl. He emerged as a Hall of Fame finalist from a pool of talented candidates in 2025, but now his path looks more complicated. Unless rules change again, which is also possible.\n\nThe Hall of Fame selection process has undergone a series of tweaks in recent years that makes it a little hard to follow. There's a different process for \"modern era\" players (guys who've been out of the league between 5-25 years) and everyone else, namely coaches, contributors and players no longer eligible for the modern-era process.\n\nIn 1972, the NFL began forwarding an \"old-timer\" candidate, a process that has continued through what we now call \"senior\" nominations.\n\nAn official \"contributor\" category with finalists, separate from the modern-era players and senior players, was added in 2015. In 2020, \"coach\" became a separate category with its own finalists. At that point, one coach, one contributor and one senior finalist (a player who'd been out of the game for 25 years or more) were forwarded by subcommittees for each category to a Hall of Fame committee, the grand-poohbah of committees that has the final vote for Hall of Famers. It was essentially a yea-or-nay process.\n\nIn 2023, the \"coach/contributor\" category was fused together, with one finalist forwarded. That process changed again in 2024 to split those two categories back up, but with a new twist.\n\nFor the past two years, the finalists have been one \"coach,\" one \"contributor\" and three \"senior\" players. Voters were allowed to pick only three of the five. They need 80% of the vote from the 50-person Hall of Fame panel, and mathematically only a maximum of three can get in. If none gets the 80%, the top vote-getter gets in.\n\nWe don't know how many votes ex-Packers receiver Sterling Sharpe received when he was a \"senior\" finalist last year, but we do know he was the only one of the five to get inducted into the Hall of Fame. That means the other four, including \"coach\" finalist Mike Holmgren, didn't get the 80% needed. Holmgren and Sharpe were, in many senses, competing directly against each other.\n\nAfter Holmgren didn't make it on the final vote last year, it was clear 2026 would be a longshot because Belichick would be eligible for the first time. And sure enough, Belichick was forwarded through as the \"coach\" selection out of the coach committee.\n\nMike Sando, one of the journalists on the 50-man panel, laid out the scenario that could keep a six-time Super Bowl champion coach from making the cut. He noted that it took only 11 voters to leave Belichick out of their three selections (assuming they even used all three selections).\n\nA handful of voters could have believed Belichick was a lock and used their votes on others who they figured would benefit more. Or, they prioritized players over a coach, or perhaps found Belichick's connection to \"Spygate\" off-putting or simply felt a coach needed to wait longer. Prior to last year, coaches weren't eligible until they'd been out of the NFL for five years, just like players, but the change to one year opened the door for Belichick to get on the ballot sooner.\n\nThere's also the interesting twist of Robert Kraft being forwarded as the \"contributor\" out of committee. It's possible some voters simply prioritized the role of the longtime Patriots owner over the celebrated Patriots coach in choosing which of the five to vote for.\n\nThe value placed upon players over coaches could be part of the explanation why none of the coaches nominated through this current process have been inducted.\n\nRecent history tells us a nominee that gets thwarted at the Hall of Fame vote doesn't guarantee that he'll get forwarded the following year for another round, although Belichick seems like a special case. Buddy Parker wasn't offered up again last year, with Holmgren in his stead, and Belichick makes three different finalists in three years.\n\nTake a look at recent developments in the \"senior\" category, too. Again, prior to 2024, the senior committee could forward only one name to the Hall of Fame committee for consideration. From 2010 through 2023 (and not counting a unique 2020 anniversary class arrangement), only one \"senior\" finalist wasn't approved. That was Dick Stanfel in 2012, and he later got approval when he was re-forwarded in 2016. When the player just needed a percentage of \"yes\" votes and didn't have to compete with other candidates, it was almost always a \"yes.\"\n\nBut the three-finalist format has been different. All three senior finalists were inducted in 2023, but only two of the three in 2024, and outlier Art Powell was not forwarded again in 2025. Instead, it was Sharpe, Jim Tyrer and Maxie Baughan, with only Sharpe getting in. And this year, Baughan and Tyrer weren't finalists, with Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood forwarded instead.\n\nThe senior committee doesn't include the same voters as the coach committee, but it's an indication that the current format lends itself to different people getting a look, even at the committee stage.\n\nThe selection process has been fluctuating wildly since 2020, when the league conducted a special centennial class that inducted 10 seniors, two coaches and three contributors in addition to the modern-era selections. It stands to reason that Belichick's omission will highlight the strain of the current process for those outside the modern-era voting purview, and that will prompt changes to upcoming years. But even separate from that, the Hall of Fame seems to be tweaking its process regularly in recent years as it searches for the right formula.\n\nThe Hall of Fame initially established the current format for three seasons, but it later changed language to indicate the process was likely to remain intact. We'll see now.\n\nJahri Evans, a guard who spent most of his career with the New Orleans Saints, played with the Packers in 2017. He's one of the 15 modern-era finalists this year.\n\nThere aren't many other Packers in the pipeline. David Bakhtiari won't be eligible until 2029. J.J. Watt, a Wisconsin native who played for the Texans and Arizona Cardinals, should be a lock in 2028, but Belichick might make the idea of \"lock\" seem more tenuous (granted the modern-era process remains separate from the coach process).\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Bill Belichick snub makes it harder for Mike Holmgren to make Hall of Fame",

    "description": "ESPN flags Jaelan Phillips' contract status as the deal every other Eagles extension will stem from.",
    "fullText": "This one is a little hard to take. When Super Bowl LX kicks off, the Philadelphia Eagles will be one of the 30 NFL teams watching from home. Why is that so significant? The answer to that question is relatively simple.\n\nIt's still hard to believe this team couldn't have beaten both the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots if they had played up to their potential. This seemed a prime opportunity to add a third Lombardi Trophy to the shelf and hang another banner.\n\nSo, now what? That's a very significant question that everyone keeps asking. Step one was admitting that changes were needed, and Philadelphia made a huge one by moving on from Kevin Patullo two days after being eliminated from the Wild Card Round.\n\nThe hunt for a new OC continues, but other landmark dates on the calendar approach. The Senior Bowl and NFL Combine come in February. Free agency begins on March 11.\n\nThe Eagles have 20 players set to hit the open market. One is mentioned on a recent list of important contractual decisions pieced together by ESPN. Most of you probably already know who the selection from Philadelphia was.\n\nESPN asked its NFL Nation reporters to pick one impending free agent from every team whose contract will shape the franchise's offseason the most. Tim McManus drew Eagles duty, and he mentions edge rusher Jaelan Phillips as his choice.\n\n\"The Eagles acquired Phillips from Miami at the November trade deadline for a 2026 third-round pick, and he proved to be a sound schematic and locker room fit. He had 2 sacks, 7 QB hits, 4 passes defensed and a forced fumble in eight games and excelled at setting the edge against the run -- a must in defensive coordinator Vic Fangio's system. Phillips' injury history might hold his value down some, but he's a young (26), productive edge rusher, which typically equals big money in free agency. Philadelphia has other contributors set to become free agents, including tight end Dallas Goedert, safety Reed Blankenship and linebacker Nakobe Dean. With players such as defensive tackles Jordan Davis and Jalen Carter eligible for paydays and only so much money to go around, the Eagles have some difficult decisions in front of them.\"\n\nPhillips joined the Eagles on November 3 after being traded from the Miami Dolphins for a 2026 third-round pick. In his first game, he stacked six tackles and recorded a red zone fumble recovery to help preserve a 10-7 win over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nHe finished the regular season with eight starts, 417 defensive snaps played, and 28 tackles, including four tackles for loss. He also added two sacks, seven additional QB hits, four pass breakups, and a forced fumble.\n\nIf the Eagles can find a way to keep Phillips, that may ultimately tell us how aggressive they plan to be in reshaping the roster. It's necessary that they do so after coming up short of expectations.\n\nPhillips answered many questions by showing some durability. He's 26 and productive. He has already proven to be a strong schematic fit in Vic Fangio's defense.\n\nHe checks nearly every box Philadelphia values. The reality is that there are so many roster decisions to make, and the need to save some coins for other young defenders approaching their payday. Phillips is the one player, however, that the Eagles can't afford to lose. Let's hope they realize that and find a way to get the job done.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Jaelan Phillips' contract status looms largest for the Eagles",

    "fullText": "The Carolina Panthers were fairly aggressive on the free-agent market in their first two offseasons under president of football operations and general manager Dan Morgan.\n\nWe saw that in 2024, when the team signed guards Robert Hunt and Damien Lewis to a combined $153 million out of the gate. They struck quickly again in 2025—landing defensive linemen Tershawn Wharton and Bobby Brown III, outside linebacker Pat Jones II and safety Tre'von Moehrig on the first day of the legal tampering period.\n\nHeck, they almost ponied all the way up for last year's top free-agent defender Milton Williams—who was whisked away by the New England Patriots at the last second.\n\nSo, now that the Panthers are the reigning NFC South champions for the first time in a decade, will they be even more inspired to spend big here in 2026?\n\nIf that's the case, here are six free agents who could tempt Carolina to break out a bag or two this spring . . .\n\nProjected annual market value, via Spotrac: $20.2 million\n\nMorgan has already publicly noted his offense's need for a home-run threat. And very few receivers in 2025 hit \"home runs\" like Pierce did.\n\nThe former second-round pick notched a first down on 87.2 percent of his receptions, the highest mark among players with at least 20 grabs. Pierce also averaged the most yards per reception (21.3) and was tied for second in catches of 40 yards or more.\n\nProjected annual market value, via Spotrac: $20.2 million\n\nLeft tackle Ikem Ekwonu sustained a ruptured patellar tendon in the team's wild-card round loss to the Los Angeles Rams. The devastating setback has brought about some uncertainty regarding the future of Ekwonu, who's entering his fifth-year option in 2026, and of the blindside in Carolina.\n\nBeing that left tackle is amongst the most premium of positions, the Panthers may want to patch up that spot in a strong way. Walker, who's been rock solid for the Green Bay Packers in his three pro seasons, is considered the top offensive tackle of this year's free-agent class.\n\nProjected annual market value, via Spotrac: $17.7 million\n\nCarolina might be looking at two changes to their starting offensive line, as center Cade Mays is ticketed for the open market. If he finds a new home, the Panthers would need a new middle man.\n\nLinderbaum has been as steady as they come since being taken by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round of the 2022 draft. In fact, he's ascending, at least according to Pro Football Focus—who graded the four-year veteran at a 74.6 overall mark in 2022, a 78.5 in 2023, a 79.9 in 2024 and an 80.2 in 2025.\n\nProjected annual market value, via Spotrac: $25.4 million\n\nIn addition to the lack of a home-run threat on offense, Morgan has also acknowledged his team's disappointing pass rush. Could he put that long-standing problem to rest by making a huge splash?\n\nHendrickson, save for his injury-shortened 2025 campaign, has been one of the most productive edge defenders in the NFL. The former first-team All-Pro amassed at least 13.5 sacks in four of the five seasons between 2020 and 2024.\n\nProjected annual market value, via Spotrac: $17.3 million\n\nAs opposed to Hendrickson, the production hasn't really been there enough for Phillips. The 2021 first-rounder has experienced a year-to-year dip in sacks over his three full seasons—with 8.5 in 2021, 7.0 in 2022 and 5.0 in 2025.\n\nBut the 26-year-old does fit the mold for what Morgan and the Panthers look for in size (6-foot-5, 266 pounds) and in athleticism off the edge. Phillips also picked up some reps under Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who runs a similar 3-4 approach to former pupil and Panthers defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero.\n\nProjected annual market value, via Spotrac: $20.1 million\n\nThe middle of the Carolina defense simply hasn't been cutting it. And that's an unfortunate reality for a franchise that has fielded the likes of Sam Mills, Jon Beason, Thomas Davis, Luke Kuechly and, oh yeah, Dan Morgan.\n\nPerhaps Morgan can find a long-term fix at his old position in Lloyd, who's fresh off his first Pro Bowl selection and a second-team All-Pro nod. The 2022 first-round pick was reliable against the run and tallied bests in interceptions (five) and quarterback hits (10).\n\nFollow @ThePanthersWire on Twitter/X for more Panthers content.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Panthers Wire: NFL free agency: 6 players who may tempt the Panthers to spend big",

    "description": "Patrick Reed, the 2018 Masters champion, is following Brooks Koepka in returning to the PGA Tour in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Patrick Reed is the second player who left the PGA Tour to play in the LIV Golf League to announce his return, after his contract with LIV expired following the 2025 season.\n\nHowever, unlike Brooks Kopeka, Reed is not subject to the Tour's \"Returning Member Program\" and won't be able to play until Aug. 25, 2026, leaving only the FedEx Cup Fall events. He will start with non-member status and can get into fall fields through sponsor invitations or Monday qualifying.\n\nThe timing has to do with the last LIV event Reed played, the LIV Team Championship in Michigan, which ended on Aug. 24, 2025. The Tour also said that since Reed resigned his membership before playing in a LIV event in 2022, \"prior to violating any PGA Tour regulations.\"\n\nThe Tour also said Reed is eligible for the 2026 Presidents Cup as a wild-card selection by captain Brandt Snedeker. He cannot, however, participate in the Tour’s player equity program until 2030.\n\nIn the meantime, Reed is eligible for the Masters as a past champion (he won in 2018), the other three majors through his World Golf Ranking (he's 29th after winning last week's DP World Tour event in Dubai) and is a full member on the DP World Tour. The PGA Tour said in a statement that Reed can pursue PGA Tour status through the DP World Tour.\n\nThe first non-major tournament Reed could play is the Biltmore Championship Sept. 17-20 in Asheville, N.C. The FedEx Cup Fall schedule ends Nov. 19-22 with the RSM Classic at the Sea Island Club on St. Simons Island, Ga.\n\nKoepka will make his first PGA Tour start this week at the Farmers Insurance Open. He left LIV Golf but qualifies for immediate reinstatement because he won a major or The Players since 2022, when LIV Golf began.\n\nThree other players who meet the criteria under the Returning Member Program, Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith of Ponte Vedra Beach, have until Feb. 2 to apply for reinstatement. They have already said publicly that they will not apply and will play LIV Golf this season.\n\nReed, 35, said in a statement that he reached the decision \"after careful thought and consideration.\"\n\n\"I’m a traditionalist at heart, and I was born to play on the PGA Tour, which is where my story began with my wife, Justine,\" he said in the statement. \"I am very fortunate for the opportunities that have come my way and grateful for the life we have created. I am moving forward in my career, and I look forward to competing on the PGA Tour and DP World Tour. I can’t wait to get back out there and revisit some of the best places on earth.\"\n\nReed is a nine-time PGA Tour winner and won the 2018 Masters by one shot over Rickie Fowler. His victory at Dubai was his fourth DP World Tour title (counting the Masters and two World Golf Championships) and if he finishes among the top-10 on the Race to Dubai, he will earn PGA Tour status.\n\nOnce Reed earns Tour status, he can begin playing under the Past Champions category.\n\nReed won one LIV Golf tournament last year in Dallas.\n\nThe Tour said in a statement that it \"has a process in place\" for former members who went to LIV Golf who do not qualify under the Returning Members Program that it said is based on a \"consistent application of the Tour’s existing regulations and policies.\"\n\nAmong the issues will be the last time a player competed in unauthorized tournaments (LIV events), outstanding disciplinary actions and their Tour status prior to leaving.\n\n\"We want to do what’s best for the Tour while maintaining competitive integrity, consistency in our process and fairness to our members,\" the statement said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Times-Union: Patrick Reed joins Brooks Koepka in leaving LIV Golf to return to PGA Tour",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Mookie Betts will be heading to the basketball court in February to coach at the Ruffles Celebrity Game during NBA All-Star weekend.\n\nThe NBA announced Betts as a coach for the game that will take place on Feb. 13 at the Kia Forum in Inglewood. ESPN’s Buster Olney was the first to report the news on Tuesday via X.\n\nDodgers superstar Mookie Betts will be coaching in the Ruffles Celeb Game in LA!\n\nFriday, 2/13 at 7:00pm/et on ESPN\n\nGet your tickets to the Ruffles Celeb Game: https://t.co/aVa6hMPMEjhttps://t.co/vP31bcmFyo\n\n— #NBAAllStar (@NBAAllStar) January 27, 2026\n\nIn addition to Betts, ESPN NBA insider Shams Charania, rapper GloRilla and producer Mustard will participate in the Celebrity Game. The rosters for each team have yet to be finalized, so it has yet to be determined which celebrities Betts will coach.\n\nBetts is not only a four-time World Series champion, an eight-time All-Star and the 2018 American League Most Valuable Player. But he is also a talented multi-sport athlete with hobbies such as golf, bowling and basketball.\n\nHe was seen playing basketball with NBA veteran Chris Paul in December shortly after the Los Angeles Clippers cut the future Hall of Famer. Betts also hosts an annual “Mookie Betts + Friends Bowling Tournament” to help raise money for his 50/50 Foundation and recently played a round of golf with former United States president Barack Obama at Lakeside Golf Club in December.\n\nAfter coaching the Celebrity Game, Betts will report to spring training with the Dodgers before the team’s first spraining training game against the Los Angeles Angels on Feb. 21.\n\nBetts is coming off a strong season at shortstop, winning his first Gold Glove at the position in 2025. He and the Dodgers are looking to win a third straight World Series championship in 2026, and Betts will be a crucial part of achieving that feat.\n\nBetts has the most World Series championships of any active player in MLB.\n\nWinning another title would put Betts into an exclusive group of MLB players who have won five World Series throughout their careers. Former New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra holds the all-time record with 10 World Series championships.\n\nThe post Dodgers Fan Favorite Set to Coach in NBA All-Star Celebrity Game appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "Kostas Tsimikas has made it clear that he is ‘very focused’ on the task ahead with Roma, despite recent rumours linking him with a return to Liverpool in January.\n\nTsimikas joined Roma on a season-long loan deal from reigning Premier League champions Liverpool over the summer, but hasn’t always found it easy to nail down opportunities at the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nThe ‘Greek Scouser’ has featured in 11 Serie A matches this term, but only for 380 minutes, only starting three times in the league so far. That is despite regular left wing-back Angelino being absent for much of the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nROME, ITALY – JANUARY 10: Josh Doig of US Sassuolo Calcio competes for the ball with Kostas Tsmikas of AS Roma during the Serie A match between AS Roma and US Sassuolo Calcio at Stadio Olimpico on January 10, 2026 in Rome, Italy. (Photo by Paolo Bruno/Getty Images)\n\nThere have been reports over the last few weeks that Tsimikas could return to Liverpool ahead of schedule, particularly if Andrew Robertson were to leave Anfield this month. However, updates over the last few days indicate that neither Tsimikas nor Robertson are set to leave their current clubs before the end of the window.\n\nTsimikas had an opportunity to address the recent rumours during his pre-match press conference ahead of Roma’s Europa League decider against Panathinaikos in his native Greece.\n\n“I try to give the best version of myself every time the coach gives me the opportunity,” Tsimikas told the media (via TMW). “I try to take advantage of it. My goal is to evolve as a footballer, to progress and I believe I can give much more. This is and will remain my goal.”\n\nLIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – AUGUST 04: Kostas Tsimikas of Liverpool during the pre-season friendly match between Liverpool v Athletic Club Bilbao at Anfield on August 04, 2025 in Liverpool, England. (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nAnd when asked to comment on the rumours of an early return to Liverpool, Tsimikas said: “I’m very focused on my team. I want to be part of this group and improve as a player. We’ve heard a lot of rumours, a lot of information, but it’s better to cover your ears and just try to give your best when the opportunities come.\n\n“For me, my only goal is this: I am here and I want to show the best of myself.”\n\nAnd on the task at hand for Roma on Thursday night, he added: “The fans in Greece are always very active, they help the players. We’ll be focused on our game. We absolutely want to win tomorrow to improve our position. We’ve come here to win and that’s the only goal.”",

    "fullText": "Wonder what Caitlin Clark thinks about the confusion surrounding Austin Reaves' imminent return to the Lakers lineup? Or whether Jeanie Buss has turned on LeBron James? Or if she has nothing but praise for Luka Doncic?\n\nTune in to the Lakers' matchup against the New York Knicks on the NBC Sports debut of “Basketball Night in America” on Sunday night to find out. Clark, the uber-popular WNBA star, will serve an analyst on the pregame show, beginning at 3 p.m. PT, one hour before tipoff.\n\nShould Reaves return Friday or Sunday after missing a month with a left calf strain, it would mark only the seventh time the guard has played together with James and Doncic. That might be the first topic addressed by Clark, who will join the studio team of Maria Taylor and three former NBA stars: Carmelo Anthony, Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady.\n\nExpectations that Reaves would take the floor Wednesday in a nationally televised game against the Cleveland Cavaliers were heightened Tuesday when ESPN insider Shams Charania posted on X that the Lakers guard would be “available to return to the lineup on Wednesday.”\n\nA few moments later, however, the post was deleted with no explanation and the Lakers' injury report lists Reaves as out.\n\nClark might stick to lauding Doncic, considering that the superstar NBA guard complimented her game in 2024, saying \"that’s the women’s Steph Curry. She can shoot it better than me.”\n\nClark, who attended Iowa, is the all-time leading scorer in NCAA history. In two seasons with the Indiana Fever, she was named WNBA Rookie of the Year and is a two-time All-Star despite missing much of the 2025 season with a severe groin injury.\n\n“Caitlin is one of the most captivating players and dynamic scorers in basketball,” NBC Sports Executive Producer Sam Flood said in a statement. “We’re excited to have Caitlin join Hall of Famers Melo, Vince, Tracy and Reggie in New York for the launch of Sunday Night Basketball.”\n\nThe Lakers-Knicks game will begin a doubleheader that also includes the Oklahoma City Thunder facing the Denver Nuggets.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

He’ll join Indiana’s incoming class of 4-star guard Prince-Alexander Moody and fellow 4-star wing Vaughn Karvala.\n\nDarian DeVries has prioritized small forwards as Indiana’s head coach, mainly those that can shoot. Indiana has played Lamar Wilkerson at the wing for much of this season but Nick Dorn, who plays more like a traditional wing, has stepped into that role due to injury issues and has excelled in the Hoosiers’ past two games.\n\nIt’s evident that Indiana is seeking a foundation to build on with DeVries’ first freshman class and I wouldn’t be surprised to see further additions from the high school or international ranks.",

    "title": "Ranking every NFL coaching hire in 2026 after Browns add Todd Monken",
    "description": "Todd Monken's hire by the Browns leaves only two NFL head-coaching vacancies left. But which additions were the best moves?",
    "fullText": "One of the wildest NFL coaching carousels in league history is finally approaching a standstill.\n\nWith 10 head-coaching vacancies popping up, the onset of the offseason was far more active than anyone could have anticipated. But after the Cleveland Browns' hiring of Todd Monken on Wednesday, Jan. 28, all but two openings – those of the Arizona Cardinals and Las Vegas Raiders – have been filled, and the initial rush for the top candidates is long over.\n\nGiven the myriad unknowns and extenuating circumstances when assessing what went right or wrong at the very top for any team, evaluating head-coaching hires can be notoriously difficult. With that said, here is our initial ranking of all the coaching hires so far:\n\nOn Black Monday, it seemed as though this year's candidate pool lacked the equivalent of a Mike Vrabel or Ben Johnson. One day later, John Harbaugh was thrown into the mix and became the clear headliner.\n\nExpecting the former Ravens coach to replicate what the New England Patriots or Chicago Bears achieved in Year 1 of their new regimes would be unreasonable. Still, Harbaugh's track record – just three losing seasons in 18 years – is the stuff of dreams for a Giants franchise tied for the fewest wins since 2017 (44).\n\nHarbaugh was the one option this cycle who looked capable of flipping an organization's culture, even if it required some uncomfortable shifts. Given how set in their ways the Giants have been, the transformation might not take place overnight. But Big Blue has seen sharp play-callers flame out, so inspiring hope was going to necessitate finding someone capable of addressing the very core of the organization.\n\nIn Harbaugh, they now have that.\n\nParting with Harbaugh only to turn to a family disciple might seem like a strange move. But in hiring Jesse Minter, Baltimore can hold onto much of what worked for the previous regime while still finding a fresh voice and direction for the franchise.\n\nWidely lauded for both his schematic acumen and his ability to connect with others, Minter already has an extensive track record of bringing along young players. That no doubt was a major draw for a Ravens team with a top-heavy roster and a firm commitment to developing home-grown talent. In Los Angeles, Minter's remaking of the defense took hold almost instantly. The Ravens might be due for a bit more upheaval on that side of the ball than they're accustomed to, but Minter could help the franchise return to its roots. At the very least, he can help the unit cut down on the considerable number of lapses that became an unfortunate running theme last season.\n\nOf course, that fails to address a pretty crucial factor: Who guides Lamar Jackson and the offense? Securing the right offensive play-caller is one of the vital early steps for Minter, and succeeding on that front might necessitate finding another answer in a year or two if his coordinator of choice flourishes and earns head-coaching consideration. But there are several promising options available, all of whom should be eager to join this staff and work with a two-time NFL MVP in Jackson.\n\nGiven owner Arthur Blank's impatience in ending the league's second-longest active playoff drought, Harbaugh understandably would have been the big prize here. But landing a two-time NFL Coach of the Year should be more than a satisfactory outcome for the Falcons.\n\nIt's fair to wonder how much blame Kevin Stefanski bears for an 8-26 record in his final two years with the Cleveland Browns. There's no questioning his resourcefulness, though, and that trait should come in handy as he takes on a far less imposing undertaking than the one he had been saddled with. His wide-zone scheme is bound to be a boon for All-Pro running back Bijan Robinson, and he can help compensate for the lack of wide receiver threats beyond Drake London.\n\nThe hiccup here could be in the potential disconnect between Stefanski's tendencies and quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s strengths, which haven't included attacking the middle of the field, working from under center or operating with reliable precision. Stefanski might have been best off coming aboard two years ago, when the team was first finding its way with his former pupil, Kirk Cousins. But Atlanta couldn't afford to center its coaching search on Penix, who is coming off a torn anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nMaybe this isn't an outright moon shot. Yet with the NFC South still looking eminently winnable, this feels like substantial progress toward at least joining the conference's second tier of contenders. Bonus points, too, for retaining defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich, who revved up the long-dormant pass rush and helped several young defenders break out in 2025.\n\nPerhaps feeling some pangs of remorse after parting with Mike Vrabel and giving an unproven entity in Brian Callahan a shot, the Titans went hard at second-time head coaches this cycle. In all, 14 of the 18 candidates they interviewed had prior experience running a franchise. With Robert Saleh, Tennessee ended up doling out a second chance to someone who has shown enough to indicate things might go smoother than they did in his first go-around.\n\nPerhaps the optics weren't great in the early going, as the first three hires this cycle all materialized ahead of scheduled visits with the Titans. But credit Tennessee for not being overly rigid in its process, which many assumed would be focused on pairing 2025 No. 1 pick Cam Ward with an offensive play-caller for a head coach.\n\nSaleh did superlative work in keeping a San Francisco 49ers defense ravaged by injuries afloat, and his plan to hang onto defensive play-calling duties while serving as head coach should facilitate an expedited turnaround on that side of the ball. Though his first stop featured plenty of mishaps with cultural development and locker room management, Saleh surely took away some lessons in what not to do at his next opportunity. And in bringing on former Giants head coach Brian Daboll as offensive coordinator to guide Ward's development, he's gotten off to a promising start in establishing a framework for the franchise to actually compete for the first time since Vrabel's firing.\n\nWith Tennessee having an estimated league-high $93.5 million in cap space, according to Over The Cap, and few promising pieces beyond Ward, Saleh at least sizes up as someone who should prove skillful in building from the ground floor.\n\nIn a vacuum, Joe Brady is a perfectly qualified candidate who would invigorate plenty of franchises. He entered the season as one of the most prominent names on the market after deciding to stay put last winter, and his play-calling acumen might be unmatched in a thin pool of offensive-minded options.\n\nBut any assessment of the Bills' hire has to take into account the circumstances of their puzzling firing of Sean McDermott and the even more baffling justification put forth by owner Terry Pegula and general manager Brandon Beane. Now, after giving every indication that the team needs to get over the \"proverbial playoff wall\" that Pegula referenced, the franchise is turning to ... a first-time head coach – and, at 36, the youngest in the NFL – who was interwoven with the issues that Pegula and Beane seemed to cite as grounds for McDermott's dismissal.\n\nPegula seemed to center Josh Allen throughout the process, including having the quarterback shape the search for McDermott's replacement. Viewed through that lens, Brady makes ample sense for Buffalo after he proved capable of orchestrating a versatile attack despite several glaring personnel limitations, particularly at receiver.\n\nPerhaps the Bills took a look around at their external options and simply weren't moved by any of the choices. (It's worth noting that they were unable to speak with Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak given the timing of McDermott's firing and the Seahawks' Super Bowl run.) But after crowing about the need for change, why skew so heavily toward the familiar?\n\nThere's clearly considerable upside for Brady here, but the challenge facing him is immense. Not only must he figure out a way to push Allen and the offense forward after the unit ranked fourth in both total yards and points in 2025, but he'll have to do so while taking on a host of unfamiliar game-management and big-picture responsibilities. Meanwhile, who leads a defense that experienced worse talent atrophy than Beane might like to admit? The cap situation – Buffalo is currently projected to be nearly $14 million overdrawn, according to Over The Cap – is also a little foreboding for a team that has several key pending free agents worth keeping – and several more who should be brought in.\n\nThere's a solid chance that the Bills can be a playoff mainstay and top-tier AFC contender under Brady. The problem for him, however, is that Buffalo has made clear that those accomplishments won't suffice.\n\nBut there's a bit more of an unknown element to him than there is for others on this list.\n\nHafley managed to revitalize the Packers' defense almost immediately upon his arrival. His creativity in navigating the unit's deficiencies at various points augurs well for a team that presents a plethora of its own shortcomings. The Dolphins could also stand to benefit from a shift in accountability after repeatedly reverting to finger-pointing under Mike McDaniel.\n\nStill, this is a lot to take on for someone whose only prior head-coaching experience was at Boston College. The Dolphins probably made the shrewd move in riding things out with a fresh face rather than expecting a retread hire to turn things around right away. But Hafley might have a harder time than some of his peers in filling out a staff capable of accounting for all his blind spots as he takes the wheel. The promotion of Bobby Slowik to offensive coordinator seems like a risky move given the pervasive protection problems he couldn't solve during his run as the Houston Texans' coordinator.\n\nAfter Mike Tomlin's resignation, chairman Art Rooney II made clear the Steelers wouldn't be undergoing a rebuild. And here's the proof.\n\nIn hiring the 62-year-old McCarthy, who has a career 60.8% winning percentage and a Super Bowl title on his résumé but little postseason success to speak of in the last decade, Pittsburgh proved it prized steady stewardship above all. On some level, that's understandable for a franchise that hasn't known what it's like to be truly out of the playoff hunt in the last 20 years. McCarthy has also demonstrated he's still a savvy play-caller − his 2022 and '23 offenses ranked fourth and first in scoring, respectively − who has unparalleled experience in leading storied organizations after his runs with the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys.\n\nBut unlike the Giants, the Steelers aren't a team needing the floor to be raised. Pittsburgh has taken up residence in the AFC's second tier without much of a threat of breaking through to the first, with its postseason win drought now standing at nine seasons.\n\nIt's difficult to see how McCarthy changes that dynamic much, even if the baseline doesn't stray too far from a .500 mark. And while the stellar quarterback play that has accompanied his past two stops might be seen as a major draw for a franchise facing plenty of uncertainty behind center, there's not much to suggest he has a substantial advantage over the field in developing a young passer − a task the Steelers desperately need to embrace but might again resist.\n\nPerhaps the most problematic element of this decision was the stretch run of the process. Pittsburgh held virtual interviews with both Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula − considered by many to be a leading candidate for the role − and Rams passing game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase. But rather than wait until after the NFC championship game for the opportunity to speak in person with both, the Steelers plowed ahead with McCarthy, who hadn't been in the mix for any of the other remaining vacancies. This was the perfect opportunity for Pittsburgh to step back and consider the full scope of its options. Instead, it opted for the familiar and unthreatening choice.\n\nIn the past few years, two of the more notable respectability plays for hires − the Las Vegas Raiders turning to Pete Carroll last year and the Jacksonville Jaguars going to Doug Pederson in 2022 − have flamed out. McCarthy likely won't go bust at the scale that the former did. But this sure feels like a missed opportunity to make up ground on the conference's actual contenders by a franchise more concerned with the prospect of ceding it.\n\nConsider this placement not so much an indictment of Todd Monken as everything Cleveland has done to get to this point.\n\nAs the Ravens' offensive coordinator, Monken proved adept at employing an innovative approach to invigorate what had been a stagnant passing game. Under his watch, the Ravens ranked third and fourth in scoring in the two seasons prior to 2025, when Lamar Jackson's injury and a host of other setbacks muddled the picture for Baltimore. That creativity will surely be needed as Cleveland looks to compensate for massive deficiencies along its offensive line and in its receiving corps. And that's to say nothing of the great unknown behind center.\n\nStill, Monken, who turns 60 next week, is one of the oldest first-time head coaching hires in recent NFL history. And from the three weeks the Browns went in between firing two-time NFL Coach of the Year Kevin Stefanski and settling on his replacement, the franchise served up plenty of reminders of why this job is so daunting.\n\nIn total, three candidates – Jesse Minter, later hired as the Baltimore Ravens' head coach; Mike McDaniel, who settled on becoming the Los Angeles Chargers' offensive coordinator; and Grant Udinski, who opted to remain the Jacksonville Jaguars' offensive coordinator – dropped out of consideration for the role. Per multiple reports, Cleveland's search was colored by a desire to retain defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, a favorite of owner Jimmy Haslam, in some capacity. With Schwartz losing out on the top role, however, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported that it was unlikely he would return to the new staff.\n\nHaving served as the team's offensive coordinator in Freddie Kitchens' disastrous one-year run in 2019, Monken is familiar with the Browns' rampant dysfunction. Maybe that will serve him well as he takes on one of the NFL's most imposing jobs. But it seems clear that the Browns' shift away from Stefanski lacked much of a vision for where the organization wanted to end up.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NFL coach hirings 2026: Ranking every hire as Browns add Todd Monken",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX — Emotions flared in last night’s matchup between the Phoenix Suns and the Brooklyn Nets, but it’s something that had been brewing on the Suns’ side well before Tuesday’s tipoff.\n\nJan 27, 2026; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Brooklyn Nets guard Terance Mann (14) is separated from Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) during a fight in the second half at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nThe game unraveled in stretches, with long reviews, repeated stoppages, and mounting frustration on both benches. Each team received four technical fouls, while the Suns had two flagrant fouls added on.\n\nWhile Phoenix came away with a scrappy win, it was the culmination of frustration with the officiating that led to what transpired on Tuesday.\n\nThat frustration boiled over in the fourth quarter during a scuffle for the ball in the paint. Phoenix guard Dillon Brooks wrestled for possession against Nets forward Ziaire Williams, as Nets teammate Egor Demin pushed Brooks to the ground.\n\nJan 27, 2026; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Brooklyn Nets guard Terance Mann (14) pushes Phoenix Suns center Mark Williams (15) during a fight in the second half at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\n“We get to a certain point, and this is where the frustration has come from our team this year as I’ve felt,” head coach Jordan Ott said postgame, according to Arizona Central’s Duane Rankin. “We play hard. We don’t flop. We don’t embellish and when that gets brought into the game, and when we feel that, that creates frustration for our guys, for me, for all of us.”\n\nPhysicality dominated the night, with both teams combining for 39 free throws. Beyond the box score was the emotional aspect of the game, as Brooks was assessed his 15th technical foul of the season (now rescinded, according to NBA Official).\n\nJan 27, 2026; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Brooklyn Nets guard Egor Demin (8) reacts after pushing Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks to the ground to start a fight in the second half at Mortgage Matchup Center.

Again, it’s extremely hard to officiate. It’s extremely hard to play through some of that. That’s where I felt it from us the most.”\n\nWhile excitement over a rare altercation filled Mortgage Matchup Center, many fans online agreed with Ott’s sentiment and noted how the Suns have had to overcome this type of officiating all season.\n\nEmotion was the catalyst for the win, but discipline and gritty play ultimately made it possible as Phoenix looks to move on and continue the grind to close out the first half of the season.\n\n“We were able to figure out a way to come out with a victory,” said Ott. “But again, great credit to the resilience of this group.”\n\nThe Suns continue their homestand Thursday, Jan. 29, when they face the Detroit Pistons at 7 p.m.\n\nValley Suns come close but lose round two to Austin Spurs",

    "fullText": "The rumors have become a reality, and the Milwaukee Bucks are now looking to move team legend Giannis Antetokounmpo. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, the two-time MVP has made it clear he is ready to be traded, and the organization is ” starting to listen” to offers from various teams.\n\nWhile a trade before next week’s deadline is no guarantee, and talks could continue into the offseason, the news seemingly ends the will-they or won’t-they saga about a trade that has been ongoing since the summer.\n\nEven with Giannis Antetokounmpo having a calf injury that could sideline him for the next month, there is sure to be a huge amount of interest in the future Hall of Famer, who wants to go to a team with championship aspirations. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the top contenders in the trade sweepstakes.\n\nThe New York Knicks have had interest in a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade for the last year. While they are sure to be the most aggressive to make a deal, there are questions about whether they have enough trade chips to get a deal done. Especially if the Bucks aren’t sold on Karl-Anthony Towns being the big return in a deal. It is why reports suggest they may need to involve another team, such as the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nHowever, the key piece of leverage that the NY Knicks do have is that they are believed to be Antetokounmpo’s preferred destination. With only one guaranteed year left on his contract, the NBA great can use the threat of an opt-out after next season and force a trade to the Knicks if he chooses to.\n\nWhile the Detroit Pistons are not expected to make a notable trade before the deadline, the No. 1 team in the conference has the player and draft assets to make a deal, as well as the cap space and expiring contracts to make the money work.\n\nDetroit should seriously consider a trade. However, the organization is cautious about big moves and may hope a trade gets pushed to the summer. Then they can take a harder look at the idea if they don’t reach the Finals this spring.\n\nAnother team that Giannis Antetokounmpo would reportedly welcome a move to is the Miami Heat. While they can’t offer a big name like Towns in return, they can build a package around some of their high-upside youngsters, Tyler Herro, and the draft assets the Knicks lack. It is part of why they are rumored to feel “confident” they can get a deal done.\n\nLike the Pistons, the San Antonio Spurs are one of the best teams in the league right now with their young core. So, a case can be made that they don’t need to make a major trade like this during the season. However, if they did attempt a pursuit, they have the trade chips to get a deal done.\n\nThey would probably lose De’Aaron Fox and/or Stephon Castle in a trade. However, the idea of Giannis Antetokounmpo being paired up with Victor Wembanyama for the next few seasons should send a shiver of fear through the Western Conference.\n\nAfter Jimmy Butler suffered a season-ending ACL tear, the Golden State Warriors’ championship hopes are dead in the water. However, the Antetokounmpo trade market now being opened offers a chance to get right back into contention for the second half.\n\nThey reportedly have told Butler they would not move his contract in a deal. And it is unclear whether the Bucks would even want him at his age and after such a serious injury. If not, they would try to build a trade package around Jonathan Kuminga’s team-friendly contract, some of the other youngsters on their roster, and whatever first-round picks they can offer.\n\nThe Trail Blazers are seen as a team willing to help facilitate a Giannis Antetokounmpo trade. But what if they actually pursued a deal to bring him to Portland? They could be an intriguing dark horse if the NBA great is willing to punt on this season because they have a pair of his pals on the team.\n\nReports this week claim he would like to be reunited with former teammate Jrue Holiday somewhere. Plus, he had a friendship with Damian Lillard before Milwaukee released him in the summer. Both are in Portland. Furthermore, they have the draft assets (including the Bucks’ picks in upcoming seasons) as well as a talented youngster like Shaedon Sharpe that can be added in an impressive trade package.\n\nNew Rumor Opens Door for Celtics or Bulls to Make Huge Trade for Emerging Superstar\n\nLeBron’s Next Team After LA Lakers Exit Revealed in New Rumor?\n\nGiannis Trade Update: Specific Team ‘Confident’ About a Deal & More",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX – When a superstar hints he may be ready for a new home, the NBA’s ecosystem shifts. Giannis Antetokounmpo has been the gravitational center of Milwaukee for a decade. Still, if the Bucks begin listening, every contender has to ask the uncomfortable question of what it takes to acquire his talents, and would it be worth it? Would the Phoenix Suns even entertain that question?\n\nFeb 6, 2024; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Detailed view of the jersey of Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (34) against the Phoenix Suns at Footprint Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFor Phoenix, the answer starts with creativity. This wouldn’t be a clean, one-for-one blockbuster. It would likely be a multi-player constructed trade offer built around scoring upside and future flexibility. Jalen Green would be the most obvious trade piece. An explosive, high-variance scorer whose career has flashed elite shot creation fits the archetype Milwaukee would need to reset around youth and offense, even if injuries have limited his recent availability. Add in veteran connective tissue like Royce O’Neale and the upside swing of Ryan Dunn, and suddenly the framework resembles something tangible, although the chances of the Phoenix Suns pulling the trigger on a trade that big right now seem slim.\n\nApr 1, 2025; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA; Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (34) drives for the basket against Phoenix Suns forward Oso Ighodaro (4) and guard Ryan Dunn (0) in the second quarter at Fiserv Forum. Mandatory Credit: Benny Sieu-Imagn Images\n\nThe data backs the temptation. Giannis remains a top-tier efficiency engine, combining rim pressure, playmaking gravity, and defensive impact that few players in history can match. Phoenix, meanwhile, has leaned heavily on stars whose availability has fluctuated. For Suns fans, the emotional math is harder. Not only does trading away talented youth hurt, but giving up on potential after a handful of games feels premature. Then there is the history behind the player, as Giannis Antetokounmpo helped deliver Milwaukee a title against Phoenix in the 2021 NBA Finals. Seeing him in a Suns jersey would feel like a glitch in the timeline.\n\nMar 24, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (34) defends against Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) at Footprint Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nBut championships are built on uncomfortable bets. It would be an absolute long shot for Phoenix, though. The Suns have the pieces, the urgency, and the incentive to make the call at least. Whether they’re willing to pay the real price, or if that is even on the table, is the story worth monitoring.\n\nMassive on-court brawl breaks out in Phoenix Suns’ win vs Nets",

I mean, I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a Hall of Famer,\" Brady said.\n\n\"We'll all be there to celebrate him when it does happen,\" he added on Belichick. \"He's going to have a huge turnout from so many players, coaches that appreciated everything that he did and the commitment that he made to winning, and the impact he had on all our lives. And that'll be a great celebration when it happens.\"\n\nBrady hits the nail on the head here. Belichick is the very definition of a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nAlong with his six Super Bowls as Patriots head coach, Belichick won two others as the defensive coordinator with the New York Giants and has the second-most wins and most Super Bowl victories among head coaches all time.\n\nThe fact that he has to wait another year to get into the Hall of Fame is outlandish and a stain on the institution, no matter your feelings on the aforementioned scandals that don't come close to erasing Belichick's greatness.\n\nNow, it'll be interesting to see if Hall of Fame voters will punish Brady in the same way they did Belichick. After all, it's now logical to think that's possible, as Brady was involved in the \"Deflategate\" scandal.\n\nIf that turns out to be the case, it will be just as big of a travesty of Belichick's snub.\n\nAlex Anzalone rumor is bad news for Lions future, pinpoints landing spot\n\nJets free-agent rumor is bad news for Commanders, Chiefs, Vikings\n\nDavis Webb rumors reveal Raiders' competition for Broncos coach\n\nRaiders and Cardinals head coach rumors pinpoint front-runners for each job\n\nRaiders head coach rumor details candidates' concern about Tom Brady\n\nSteelers linked to $230M quarterback based on old McCarthy quote",

For Brooks, it was his 15th tech of the season, placing him one away from a suspension this year.\n\nFortunately, Brooks will not be in danger of suspension the next time he steps on the court. On Wednesday, the NBA announced that the technical foul had been rescinded upon league office review. That’s great news for the Suns, who have been fortunate to see Brooks take a major step for their team this season.\n\nBrooks wrapped up Tuesday night’s action with 26 points off 9-15 shooting from the field, 2-5 from three, and 6-6 from the charity stripe. He added three rebounds, three assists, one steal, and one block in 34 minutes of action. The Suns defeated the Nets 106-102.\n\nSince getting traded to the Suns from the Houston Rockets, Brooks has taken his game to another level.\n\nIn 41 matchups, the veteran forward has shot 44 percent from the field. He is attempting 7.0 threes per game, knocking down 34 percent of his shots from beyond the arc. The veteran forward is producing 20.5 points per game, which marks a new career-high for him. He is also producing 2.9 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game.\n\nAfter a major offseason shakeup, the NBA world didn’t know what to make of the Suns this year. So far, they have been highly impressive.

So accuracy is not the primary goal here since we don't know what additions will be made in the coming months.\n\nInstead, what this offseason exercise highlights are the positional needs that GM James Gladstone has to tackle this offseason. For example, in terms of sheer numbers, the Jaguars are very thin on the defensive side of the ball right now.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, Nick Mullens, Carter Bradley\n\nPerhaps the Jaguars add another developmental prospect to compete with Carter Bradley on the practice squad.\n\nBhayshul Tuten, LeQuint Allen, Ja'Quinden Jackson\n\nDoes Travis Etienne return? If not, the Jaguars already have their top two running backs on the depth chart, but added depth for training camp is needed.\n\nBrian Thomas Jr., Parker Washington, Jakobi Meyers, Austin Trammell, Tim Jones, Chandler Brayboy\n\nTravis Hunter will factor in here as well. The Jaguars will still need to add more competition to the back end of this position group.\n\nBrenton Strange, Johnny Mundt, Hunter Long, Patrick Herbert\n\nThis will be a position that Gladstone should prioritize a bit this offseason. Quintin Morris -- who was TE2 the second half of the season -- is a free agent, while Mundt and Long are entering the final year of their deals.\n\nEzra Cleveland, Chuma Edoga, Robert Hainsey, Anton Harrison, Walker Little, Patrick Mekari, Cole Van Lanen, Wyatt Milum, Jonah Monheim, Ricky Lee\n\nThere's no such thing as too much competition on the offensive line, but the Jaguars are set up well at this position group entering the offseason.\n\nJosh Hines-Allen, Travon Walker, BJ Green, Danny Striggow, Arik Armstead, DaVon Hamilton, Maason Smith, Keivie Rose\n\nMore pass rush juice at defensive tackle and depth at both position groups should be high priorities.\n\nYasir Abdullah, Branson Combs, Ventrell Miller, Foye Oluokun, Jalen McLeod, Jack Kiser\n\nIf Devin Lloyd isn't back, who is starting next to Oluokun?\n\nTravis Hunter, Jarrian Jones, Jourdan Lewis, Jabbar Muhammad, Trevian Thomas\n\nThese are all the cornerbacks on the Jaguars roster at the moment.\n\nRayuan Lane, Eric Murray, Antonio Johnson, Caleb Ransaw, Cam'Ron Silmon-Craig\n\nThere are only five safeties on the current roster, so depth is needed, but this unit is positioned well entering the offseason.\n\nLogan Cooke, Ross Matiscik, Cam Little\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: Jaguars roster: Way-too-early 53-man prediction before 2026 offseason",

Except I've been receiving all of their emails just fine! The problem, it turns out, is that surveillance capitalism is now so-widespread that the bank cannot conceive that their own attempts to spy on their customers might not be 100% reliable...",
    "fullText": "I have a credit card with HSBC1:\n you know, the bank with virtue-signalling multiculturalism in their ads.\n\nNot long ago I received a letter from them telling me that emails to me were being “returned undelivered” and they needed me to update the email address on my account.\n\nI logged into my account, per the instructions in the letter, and discovered my correct email address already right there, much to my… lack of surprise2.\n\nSo I kicked off a live chat via their app, with an agent called Ankitha. Over the course of a drawn-out hour-long conversation, they repeatedly told to tell me how to update my\n email address (which was never my question). Eventually, when they understood that my email address was already correct, then they concluded the call, saying (emphasis mine):\n\nI can understand your frustration, but if the bank has sent the letter, you will have to update the e-mail address.\n\nThis is the point at which a normal person would probably just change the email address in their online banking to a “spare” email address.\n\nBut aside from the fact that I’d rather not3, by this point I’d caught the scent of a deeper underlying issue.\n After all, didn’t I have a conversation a little like this one but with a different bank, about four years\n ago?\n\nSo I called Customer Services directly4,\n who told me that if my email address is already correct then I can ignore their letter.\n\nI suggested that perhaps their letter template might need updating so it doesn’t say “action required” if action is not required. Or that perhaps what they mean to say is\n “action required: check your email address is correct”.\n\nSo anyway, apparently everything’s fine… although I reserved final judgement until I’d seen that they were still sending me emails!\n\nI think I can place a solid guess about what went wrong here. But it makes me feel like we’re living in the Darkest Timeline.\n\nI dissected HSBC’s latest email to me: it was of the “your latest statement is available” variety. Deep within the email, down at the bottom, is this code:\n\nWhat you’re seeing are two tracking pixels: tiny 1×1 pixel images, usually transparent or white-on-white to make them even-more invisible, used to surreptitiously track when\n somebody reads an email. When you open an email from HSBC – potentially every time you open an email from them – your email client connects to those web addresses to get\n the necessary images. The code at the end of each identifies the email they were contained within, which in turn can be linked back to the recipient.\n\nYou know how invasive a read-receipt feels? Tracking pixels are like those… but turned up to eleven. While a read-receipt only says “the recipient read this email” (usually only after\n the recipient gives consent for it to do so), a tracking pixel can often track when and how often you refer to an email5.\n\nIf I re-read a year-old email from HSBC, they’re saying that they want to know about it.\n\nBut it gets worse. Because HSBC are using http://, rather than https:// URLs for their tracking pixels, they’re also saying that every time you read an email\n from them, they’d like everybody on the same network as you to be able to know that you did so, too. If you’re at my house, on my WiFi, and you open an email from HSBC, not\n only might HSBC know about it, but I might know about it too.\n\nAn easily-avoidable security failure there, HSBC… which isn’t the kind of thing one hopes to hear about a bank!\n\nBut… tracking pixels don’t actually work. At least, they doesn’t work on me. Like many privacy-conscious individuals, my devices are configured to block tracking pixels (and a\n variety of other instruments of surveillance capitalism) right out of the gate.\n\nThis means that even though I do read most of the non-spam email that lands in my Inbox, the sender doesn’t get to know that I did so unless I choose to tell them.\n This is the way that email was designed to work, and is the only way that a sender can be confident that it will work.\n\nBut we’re in the Darkest Timeline. Tracking pixels have become so endemic that HSBC have clearly come to the opinion\n that if they can’t track when I open their emails, I must not be receiving their emails. So they wrote me a letter to tell me that my emails have been “returned\n undelivered” (which seems to be an outright lie).\n\nSurveillance capitalism has become so ubiquitous that it’s become transparent. Transparent like the invisible spies at the bottom of your bank’s emails.\n\nSo in summary, with only a little speculation:\n\nInstead of sending me a misleading letter about undelivered emails, perhaps a better approach for HSBC could be:\n\nAlso, to quote your own principles once more: when you make a mistake like assuming your spying is a flawless way to detect the validity of email addresses, perhaps you should “be\n transparent with our customers and other stakeholders about how we use their data”.\n\nWouldn’t that be better than writing to a customer to say that their emails are being returned undelivered (when they’re not)… and then having your staff tell them that having received\n such an email they have no choice but to change the email address they use (which is then disputed by your other staff)?\n\n1 Long, long ago I also had a current account with HSBC which I forgot to close when I\n switched banks… 20 years ago… and I possibly still owe them for the six pence the account was in debt at the time.\n\n2 After all, I’d been reading their emails!\n\n3 After all, as I’ll stress again: the email address HSBC have for me, and are using,\n is already correct.\n\n4 In future, I’ll just do this in the first instance. The benefits of live chat being able\n to be done “in the background” while one gets on with some work are totally outweighed when the entire exchange takes an hour only to reach an unsatisfactory conclusion,\n whereas a telephone call got things sorted (well hopefully…) within 10 minutes.\n\n5 A tracking pixel can also collect additional personal information about you, such as\n your IP address at the time that you opened the email, which might disclose your location.\n\n6 It could be even worse still, actually! A sophisticated attacker could “inject” images\n into the bottom of a HSBC email; those images could, for example, be pictures of text saying things like “You need to urgently call HSBC on [attacker’s phone number].” This would\n allow a scammer to hijack a legitimate HSBC email by injecting their own content into the bottom of it. Seriously, HSBC, you ought to fix this.",

    "description": "The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Trump administration has not shied away from sharing AI-generated imagery online, embracing cartoonlike visuals and memes and promoting them on official White House channels.\n\nBut an edited — and realistic — image of civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong in tears after being arrested is raising new alarms about how the administration is blurring the lines between what is real and what is fake.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s account posted the original image from Levy Armstrong’s arrest before the official White House account posted an altered image that showed her crying. The doctored picture is part of a deluge of AI-edited imagery that has been shared across the political spectrum since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Patrol officers in Minneapolis.\n\nHowever, the White House’s use of artificial intelligence has troubled misinformation experts who fear the spreading of AI-generated or edited images erodes public perception of the truth and sows distrust.\n\nIn response to criticism of the edited image of Levy Armstrong, White House officials doubled down on the post, with deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr writing on X that the “memes will continue.” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson also shared a post mocking the criticism.\n\nDavid Rand, a professor of information science at Cornell University, says calling the altered image a meme “certainly seems like an attempt to cast it as a joke or humorous post, like their prior cartoons. This presumably aims to shield them from criticism for posting manipulated media.” He said the purpose of sharing the altered arrest image seems “much more ambiguous” than the cartoonish images the administration has shared in the past.\n\nMemes have always carried layered messages that are funny or informative to people who understand them, but indecipherable to outsiders. AI-enhanced or edited imagery is just the latest tool the White House uses to engage the segment of Trump’s base that spends a lot of time online, said Zach Henry, a Republican communications consultant who founded Total Virality, an influencer marketing firm.\n\n“People who are terminally online will see it and instantly recognize it as a meme,” he said. “Your grandparents may see it and not understand the meme, but because it looks real, it leads them to ask their kids or grandkids about it.”\n\nAll the better if it prompts a fierce reaction, which helps it go viral, said Henry, who generally praised the work of the White House’s social media team.\n\nThe creation and dissemination of altered images, especially when they are shared by credible sources, “crystallizes an idea of what’s happening, instead of showing what is actually happening,” said Michael A. Spikes, a professor at Northwestern University and news media literacy researcher.\n\n“The government should be a place where you can trust the information, where you can say it’s accurate, because they have a responsibility to do so,” he said. “By sharing this kind of content, and creating this kind of content … it is eroding the trust — even though I’m always kind of skeptical of the term trust — but the trust we should have in our federal government to give us accurate, verified information. It’s a real loss, and it really worries me a lot.”\n\nSpikes said he already sees the “institutional crises” around distrust in news organizations and higher education, and feels this behavior from official channels inflames those issues.\n\nRamesh Srinivasan, a professor at UCLA and the host of the Utopias podcast, said many people are now questioning where they can turn to for “trustable information.” “AI systems are only going to exacerbate, amplify and accelerate these problems of an absence of trust, an absence of even understanding what might be considered reality or truth or evidence,” he said.\n\nSrinivasan said he feels the White House and other officials sharing AI-generated content not only invites everyday people to continue to post similar content but also grants permission to others who are in positions of credibility and power, like policymakers, to share unlabeled synthetic content. He added that given that social media platforms tend to “algorithmically privilege” extreme and conspiratorial content — which AI generation tools can create with ease — “we’ve got a big, big set of challenges on our hands.”\n\nAn influx of AI-generated videos related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement action, protests and interactions with citizens has already been proliferating on social media. After Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer while she was in her car, several AI-generated videos began circulating of women driving away from ICE officers who told them to stop. There are also many fabricated videos circulating of immigration raids and of people confronting ICE officers, often yelling at them or throwing food in their faces.\n\nJeremy Carrasco, a content creator who specializes in media literacy and debunking viral AI videos, said the bulk of these videos are likely coming from accounts that are “engagement farming,” or looking to capitalize on clicks by generating content with popular keywords and search terms like ICE. But he also said the videos are getting views from people who oppose ICE and DHS and could be watching them as “fan fiction,” or engaging in “wishful thinking,” hoping that they’re seeing real pushback against the organizations and their officers.\n\nStill, Carrasco also believes that most viewers can’t tell if what they’re watching is fake, and questions whether they would know “what’s real or not when it actually matters, like when the stakes are a lot higher.”\n\nEven when there are blatant signs of AI generation, like street signs with gibberish on them or other obvious errors, only in the “best-case scenario” would a viewer be savvy enough or be paying enough attention to register the use of AI.\n\nThis issue is, of course, not limited to news surrounding immigration enforcement and protests. Fabricated and misrepresented images following the capture of deposed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro exploded online earlier this month. Experts, including Carrasco, think the spread of AI-generated political content will only become more commonplace.\n\nCarrasco believes that the widespread implementation of a watermarking system that embeds information about the origin of a piece of media into its metadata layer could be a step toward a solution. The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity has developed such a system, but Carrasco doesn’t think that will become extensively adopted for at least another year.\n\n“It’s going to be an issue forever now,” he said. I don’t think people understand how bad this is.”",

    "fullText": "The UK is the country with no bloc.\n\nAt Davos, Britain refused to join Trump's Board of Peace, citing commitment to international law and rejection of the \"pay-to-play\" model. France, Germany, Sweden, Norway made the same choice. The difference is that those countries have somewhere else to go. Britain doesn't.\n\nThe SAFE instrument, the EU's €150 billion fund for joint defense procurement, is designed explicitly for strategic autonomy. Strict \"Buy European\" provisions limit non-EU subcontractors to 15-35% of contract value, phased out within two years. Canada, remarkably, negotiated access and now has preferential treatment on par with EU firms. The UK remains excluded.\n\nTalks broke down in late 2025. The EU's requirements for third-country participation, London viewed as an infringement on sovereignty. The same sovereignty concerns that drove Brexit now lock Britain out of the emerging European defense architecture. The \"mid-Atlantic bridge\" was always a metaphor. Britain positioned itself as the hinge between American power and European integration, useful to both, dependent on neither. That positioning assumed both poles wanted a bridge. Now the US treats allies as protection rackets and the EU is building walls around its defense industrial base. The bridge has nowhere to land.\n\nWhat does the Starmer government do? The choices were supposed to be theoretical. Align with Washington and accept the transactional terms of the Donroe Doctrine. Align with Brussels and accept the sovereignty constraints of SAFE participation. Or go it alone, with a defense budget that can't sustain independent capability against peer competitors.\n\nThe IISS analysis of SAFE's implications for non-EU suppliers is blunt: firms outside the bloc face structural disadvantages that compound over time. Procurement cycles last decades. If British defense firms are locked out of European contracts now, the gap widens with each passing year. The industrial base erodes.\n\n\"Global Britain\" was the slogan after Brexit, a vision of nimble bilateral relationships unconstrained by Brussels bureaucracy. The reality is that global influence requires either hard power or bloc membership. Britain has neither the military budget for the former nor the political will for the latter.\n\nCanada's pivot is instructive. Facing similar pressure from Washington, Carney diversified, joining SAFE, negotiating with Beijing, building horizontal coalitions with other middle powers. Britain has done none of this. It refused the Board of Peace on principle but hasn't found an alternative structure to join on pragmatism.\n\nPrinciples without alternatives is just isolation. The UK is learning what it means to be a middle power without a coalition, morally opposed to the new American order but structurally excluded from the European one.",

No constraints. No surfacing. Just delete it.\n\nThe shipped vcad used manifold — a mesh-based geometry kernel. Great for 3D printing. Not enough for real parametric CAD.\n\nSo I built a real one. That night.\n\nHere's the core issue. Watch this cylinder:\n\nOn the left: a mesh. Triangles approximating a curve. The more triangles, the smoother it looks — but it's always an approximation. Zoom in far enough and you'll see the facets.\n\nOn the right: a boundary representation. The cylinder isn't stored as triangles. It's stored as a mathematical surface — a parametric equation that defines every point exactly. The orange lines are UV parameter curves, showing how the surface can be evaluated at any resolution.\n\nBRep isn't just about smooth surfaces. It's about structure. Every solid has a hierarchy:\n\nVertices → Edges → Faces → Shells → Solids\n\nEach vertex knows which edges touch it. Each edge knows which faces bound it. Each face knows its surface equation and its boundary loops. This connectivity is what makes operations like filleting and booleans possible.\n\nIn vcad-kernel-topo, every element has a unique ID and maintains bidirectional links to its neighbors. Modify one edge, and you can traverse the structure to find every affected face.\n\nOne comment said mesh-based systems can't do surfacing. Here's why.\n\nA fillet is created by rolling a ball along an edge:\n\nThe ball stays tangent to both faces. The path it traces becomes the fillet surface. Simple concept. Hard math.\n\nWith triangle meshes, there's no \"edge\" — just a crease between triangles. The ball has nothing smooth to roll against. You end up with a chamfered polygon, not a true fillet.\n\nWith BRep, the edge is a real curve. The faces are real surfaces. The ball rolls along the exact geometry, and you get a mathematically precise blend surface.\n\nWhen you subtract one shape from another, the kernel has to:\n\nSurface-surface intersection (SSI) is the dragon. Two NURBS surfaces can intersect in curves that branch, loop, and degenerate. My ssi.rs is ~500 lines of marching algorithms and Newton-Raphson refinement. She's ugly but she runs.\n\nIt is now. Parametric means constraints. You don't just draw geometry — you declare relationships. This line is horizontal. These two lines are equal length. This point lies on that circle.\n\nThe solver takes your messy sketch and finds positions that satisfy all constraints. Under the hood: Newton-Raphson on a system of nonlinear equations. Each constraint becomes an error function. Minimize total error. Done.\n\nNow when you change one dimension, everything that depends on it updates automatically. That's the \"parametric\" in parametric CAD.\n\nComments hit around noon. By midnight: BRep kernel.\n\nTwelve crates. Pure Rust. Compiles to WASM.\n\nTwelve hours. Coffee. Spite. Claude.\n\nOpenCASCADE is 3.6 million lines of C++ with LGPL licensing and documentation that reads like a Soviet technical manual.\n\nI wanted something I could understand, modify, and ship to WASM. Something with cargo test. Something mine.\n\nI'm not building a weekend project. I'm building a Fusion 360 replacement.\n\nOpen source. Self-hosted. No subscription. No cloud lock-in. No \"we're sunsetting your pricing tier.\"\n\nFusion charges $680/year and can't run without Autodesk's servers. Onshape is browser-based but your IP lives on their cloud.

    "fullText": "Apple is working on a wearable device that will allow the user to take advantage of AI models, according to sources familiar with the product who spoke with tech publication The Information.\n\nThe product is said to be “the same size as an AirTag, only slightly thicker,” and will be worn as a pin, inviting comparisons to the failed Humane AI pin that launched to bad reviews and lackluster sales in 2024. The Humane product was criticized for sluggish performance and low battery life, but those shortcomings could potentially be addressed by Apple’s solution, should Apple offload the processing to a synced external device like an iPhone.\n\nThe Information’s sources don’t specify whether that’s the plan, or if it will be a standalone device.\n\nThe wearable will have a single physical button “along its edges” and will feature a speaker. It will have three microphones and two cameras (one regular and one wide-angle) for capturing information about the user’s surroundings. It will use a magnetic inductive wireless charging surface similar to the one used to charge the Apple Watch.\n\nThe report didn’t include any information about pricing, but it did say that Apple has fast-tracked the product with the hope to release it as early as 2027. Twenty million units are planned for launch, suggesting the company does not expect it to be a sensational consumer success at launch the way some of its past products, like AirPods, have been.\n\nNot long ago, it was reported that OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) plans to release its own hardware, though the specifics and form factor are not publicly known. Apple is expecting fierce competition there, as well as with Meta, which Apple already expected to compete with in the emerging and related smart glasses market.\n\nApple has experienced significant internal turmoil over AI, with former AI lead John Giannandrea’s conservative approach to the technology failing to lead to a usable, true LLM-based Siri or other products analysts expect would make Apply stay competitive in the space with other Big Tech companies.\n\nJust a few days ago, it was revealed that Apple will tap Google’s Gemini large language models for an LLM overhaul of Siri. Other AI-driven products like smart glasses and an in-home smart display are also planned.",

    "fullText": "On the morning of January 28, 1986, seven crew members were killed when the space shuttle Challenger broke apart a little over a minute after it launched.\n\nThose killed included five NASA astronauts, one payload specialist, and a civilian schoolteacher.\n\nThis mission was Challenger's 10th, but the shuttle exploded due to a design flaw in a seal that was exacerbated by cold temperatures on launch day. A joint in one of the rocket boosters failed at liftoff, and the external fuel tank subsequently collapsed, leading to the demise of the vehicle.\n\nChallenger was the second shuttle to reach space, which it did in April 1983. It also sent the first African-American astronaut into space, completed the first in-flight capture and repair of a satellite, and launched the first US woman in space.\n\nThe 1986 disaster marked a turning point for NASA. An investigation after the explosion found that many engineers and astronauts believed NASA was pushing its programs forward at breakneck speed, without sufficient funding or testing. NASA added more internal checks and processes after the event to prevent similar tragedies.\n\nThe space agency also stopped sending civilians on potentially dangerous space-shuttle missions.\n\nThe new orbiter sat atop a 747 carrier aircraft.\n\nThe ship led the Challenger Expedition: a groundbreaking marine research trip from 1872 to 1876.\n\nFor its maiden voyage, the Challenger deployed a communications satellite and conducted a space walk.\n\nAfter that first flight, Challenger flew 85% of all space-shuttle missions during its lifetime.\n\nSally Ride served as a mission specialist in 1983 and returned to space on the Challenger in 1984.\n\nBluford flew to space a total of four times.\n\n\"It may have been one small step for Neil, but it's a heck of a big leap for me,\" McCandless said of his untethered space walk, according to NASA.\n\nThe crew consisted of teacher-in-space Christa McAuliffe, astronauts Gregory Jarvis and Judith Resnik, mission commander Dick Scobee, astronaut Ronald McNair, pilot Mike Smith, and astronaut Ellison Onizuka.\n\nThe cause of the malfunction was later found to be rubber O-rings that were not sealed properly on the right Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster due to the cold weather.\n\nThe disaster was broadcast on live television.\n\nA memorial marker was also dedicated at Arlington National Cemetery in 1987, with the grave site featuring cremated remains from all seven crew members.\n\nIn place of a national space-shuttle program, NASA has partnered with Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to develop new vehicles for returning astronauts to the moon.\n\nIn May 2020, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken flew on SpaceX's first crewed mission and became the first astronauts to launch into space from the US since NASA's space-shuttle program ended in 2011. They spent two months on the International Space Station before returning in August 2020.",

    "description": "Amazon announced it's cutting 16,000 jobs. The career coach Kyle Elliott said you should use these two critical tools to help you find a job after a layoff.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kyle Elliott, 33, a career coach who lives in California. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nGetting laid off is very traumatic — and it's becoming more common.\n\nI've been a full-time career coach to tech employees at startups and in Big Tech since 2017, and I've seen how layoffs have become more visible in recent years.\n\nI help clients navigate life after a layoff, including what role they want next and how to apply for new jobs.\n\nAmazon has announced new plans to cut staff, and I want affected employees to remember that they are coming from one of the world's top companies.\n\nPeople will want them, and they will find something.\n\nWhen people reach out to me for coaching after a layoff, many have a scarcity mindset and feel like they have to apply for any job.\n\nFor some people who urgently need to pay rent or put food on the table, that's necessary. But in other cases, it makes sense to take a beat and evaluate what you're really looking for in your next role.\n\nThe very first thing I ask clients to do is create a list of \"must-haves\" and \"dealbreakers\" for their next job. What are their salary expectations? Will they only work remotely? Are they willing to relocate? If you write the list before you start interviewing, you can act from a place of logic rather than panic.\n\nThe second step is to update your résumé and LinkedIn profile, which are two of your most critical tools in today's market. You're going to submit a résumé with almost every application, and having an up-to-date LinkedIn account puts you in a good position if potential employers check it or recruiters go looking for talent on the platform.\n\nYou want to optimize for the roles you're looking for in 2026, which means that if you were an engineer when you joined Amazon but are now a director, you want to make sure that's reflected on your LinkedIn page.\n\nI've seen clients turn to quick hacks for their job search, like asking AI to tailor their résumé or using it to find and apply to roles for them. But if everyone does that, you don't stand out.\n\nI can usually tell quickly if someone's written their résumé with AI. For example, they'll be applying to a systems engineer role, and it won't even have the phrase \"systems engineer\" in it.\n\nEveryone thinks only AI is reading their résumé, but I have clients who work in talent acquisition and HR — the humans who are still involved in the recruitment process. Humans hire other humans, even at big companies.\n\nIn the age of AI, be more human. Take a step back and think, if you were a human looking at this résumé, what would you want to see? Then put those phrases near the top, rather than using AI to create generic slop.\n\nI'd suggest creating a master résumé that you can spend 20 minutes tailoring for different roles. If you're using AI, use it more like an extra tool, rather than the thing that's driving your job search.\n\nLayoffs are normal now, especially in the tech industry, and there's much less stigma around them.\n\nBut there's more competition in the job market, because it's easier to apply for jobs with AI, for example, so the challenges around layoffs are different nowadays.\n\nIn today's job market, it's important to figure out what's unique about you. Lots of people will meet the job requirements, so you need to communicate why the company should hire you over the thousands of other applicants.\n\nOne thing that can help you is to look back at performance reviews and identify things people repeatedly say about you. You can try asking three to five people to share what makes you fabulous and to give examples. I've found that clients are surprised by the feedback they receive.",

    "fullText": "Some of the biggest companies in the world want to let you know how they're doing.\n\n(Want might be a strong word. It's more like, are required to by regulators, but that doesn't roll off the tongue.)\n\nEither way, seven companies with market caps totalling more than $20 trillion are checking in.\n\nI broke down what to keep an eye out for with each of them.\n\nMeta: Mark Zuckerberg still wants to spend big on AI. There's one problem. Meta, unlike some of its Big Tech peers, doesn't have a cloud business that's already benefiting from the AI boom. And its ads business wasn't enough to stop investors from getting spooked last earnings.\n\nRecently, Meta has cut down its metaverse team and overhauled its review program. Still, investors want to see real returns, which could mean Meta's in for another intense year.\n\nMicrosoft: Pivoting a company with a market cap north of roughly $3.5 trillion isn't easy, but CEO Satya Nadella is giving it his best shot. Nadella tapped a new advisor to \"rethink the new economics of AI\" for Microsoft. The big boss views AI as both a massive threat and a huge opportunity that could define the tech giant's future.\n\nSomething else to watch: Any chatter about Microsoft's plans (and partnerships) in the wake of its restructured agreement with OpenAI.\n\nTesla: There's the traditional auto business to consider, but Elon Musk will likely focus more on the future. Specifically, progress and plans for Tesla's robotaxi business and robotic humanoid, Optimus. It's part of Tesla's ongoing rebrand from an EV maker to AI company.\n\nMusk has relied on touting what's to come, as opposed to what's already here. But are investors still buying a dream that's yet to materialize?\n\nApple: The odd one out in the AI race, Apple is opting to partner rather than build its own huge foundation models. The latest nod toward that strategy is the deal it struck with Google Gemini to power Siri's AI.\n\nThat's why iPhone sales will remain the key number to look out for, especially when it comes to its second-largest market: China.\n\nAlphabet: Few companies have had a better run over the past three months than Alphabet. Gemini 3's launch has put Google at the front of the AI race and pushed it into the uber-elite $4 trillion market-cap club.\n\nNext up? How Google will continue to reshape its crown jewel — Search — in the age of its AI Overviews.\n\nAmazon: Just in: Amazon said it's cutting 16,000 employees. (Some employees got an advanced notice.) The latest reductions were announced by Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, who described the move as part of efforts to cut back on bureaucracy inside the company.\n\nAmazon was fresh off cutting roughly 14,000 jobs in the run-up to last earnings. The company still managed to get on Wall Street's good side in the immediate aftermath. We'll see if it can do it again.",

    "description": "My brother and I visited Beverly Hills for our first trip as adults. I thought the trip would expose our differences, but it only brought us closer.",
    "fullText": "As someone who travels for a living, I'm notoriously picky — not about where I go, but who I go with.\n\nAt the top of my roster of incompatible travel partners? My brother, Eric, who's six years my junior and my opposite in nearly every way. At 21, he's an extreme extrovert who prefers midnights to mornings and the gym to the great outdoors.\n\nTo be fair, we hadn't traveled together in roughly a decade. But I assumed our vastly different adult lifestyles would make vacationing together difficult.\n\nHowever, when he graduated from college last year, I decided to take the risk and surprise him with a trip to Beverly Hills. And so, we embarked on our first-ever trip together as adults.\n\nWhen traveling, I like to keep the same five outfits washed and rolled in my packing cubes. Eric, however, has a TikTok-approved skincare regimen and different sneakers for every occasion.\n\nIt's no wonder, then, that our packing processes highlighted our differences — my brother ironed a suit while I shoved Birkenstocks in my backpack.\n\nAt first, I made fun of his maximalist approach, but as his carry-on expanded, I found myself re-evaluating my own strategy.\n\nBecause I travel so often, it's easy to forget that new places invite the opportunity to embrace new identities. Eric's meticulous planning, however, reminded me of just how fun it is to shapeshift while vacationing.\n\nInspired by his approach, I threw in a shiny dress I rarely wear and a top to match my brother's tie. I ended up wearing both outfits, which made the trip feel all the more like a special occasion, distinct from my normal, day-to-day life.\n\nBecause Beverly Hills is both compact and walkable, the city served as the perfect playground for our two-day adventure, which encompassed bucket-list moments, like walking down Rodeo Drive, as well as more mundane milestones.\n\nFor instance, Eric and I had never gone out for drinks together, so merely ordering cocktails at a rooftop restaurant ushered us into new territory. Over a leisurely lunch, we discovered a shared taste for espresso martinis and halloumi, neither of which Eric had ever tried.\n\nWe also enjoyed a meal at a fine-dining restaurant, where we watched the chef meticulously prepare 20 exquisite courses of new-to-us foods — none of which we'd ever be able to find in our New Jersey hometown.\n\nAs we left the restaurant, Eric declared the meal among the best he'd ever had, and we texted photos to our parents, inciting jealousy over fresh fish galore.\n\nAlthough I was initially worried about traveling together because of our differences, the trip made me realize how similar we really are. It was especially fun to travel with someone whose upbringing and, therefore, perspective matched my own.\n\nNeither of us was accustomed to the norms of luxurious Beverly Hills, so we didn't have to play anything cool. Rather, we shared and fed off each other's mutual excitement over sights that were new to both of us.\n\nDuring a rooftop meal, for instance, Eric and I spotted the Hollywood sign from our table. Although our fellow diners appeared oblivious to the scenery, my brother and I were, quite literally, kicking each other under the table.\n\nThroughout the trip, we reveled in that novelty, reacting to the glamorous stimuli of Los Angeles from parallel perspectives.\n\nPlus, it was nice to be the truest, most authentic version of myself on this trip. Whenever I'm traveling with friends or colleagues, I typically struggle to vouch for myself and resort to my default people-pleasing mode. With Eric, however, I didn't have to tread so delicately.\n\nOver the last 20-something years, we've become adept at moving past any and all disagreements; there's no need to worry about a travel-induced friendship falling out or hurt feelings when we're together. We're experts at speaking openly and directly with each other, advocating for whatever it is we want.\n\nSince landing back home at Newark airport, Eric has been adapting to postgrad life, so we won't have another chance to travel together for a while. Beverly Hills, however, set us up with a new dynamic through shared experiences of our own making.\n\nIn a way, our trip to California was the segue to our friendship as adults — and an introduction to new layers of each other and ourselves.",

    "fullText": "Winning the Grammy for best new artist is considered a high honor in the music industry.\n\nWith iconic musicians like The Beatles, Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys, John Legend, and Adele all taking home the award, it's easy to see why this Grammy is so sought after.\n\nBut many of the biggest names in music went on to launch successful careers even though they didn't win the award.\n\nHere are 19 of the biggest stars who were nominated for — but lost — the Grammy for best new artist.\n\nHe's now one of the most famous names in the music industry, but in 1971, John lost the award for best new artist to The Carpenters.\n\nJohn has since won five Grammys. He's also one of few stars to reach EGOT status, meaning he's won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.\n\nIn 1992, Boyz II Men lost the award for best new artist to the singer-songwriter Marc Cohn.\n\nThe trio didn't leave empty-handed, as they took home the award for best R&B performance by a duo or group with vocals that same night.\n\nThe group has earned four Grammys and 15 nominations.\n\nAt the 1995 ceremony, Green Day was nominated for best new artist alongside Ace of Base, Counting Crows, Crash Test Dummies, and Crow.\n\nAlthough the award went to Crow, Green Day's album \"Dookie\" took home the prize for best alternative music performance that same night.\n\nThe band has since won four Grammys.\n\nKnown for iconic songs like \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" and \"You're Still the One,\" Twain's music has sold millions of copies worldwide.\n\nBut when she was up for best new artist at the 1996 Grammys, Hootie & the Blowfish took home the award.\n\nIn 2000, Spears was making a name for herself in pop music, coming off the success of her debut single \"...Baby One More Time.\"\n\nThat same year, Spears missed out on the Grammy for best new artist, which went to her \"Mickey Mouse Club\" costar Aguilera.\n\nSpears won her first and only Grammy in 2005 for her song \"Toxic.\"\n\nLike Lavigne, Mayer also lost out on the title of best new artist in 2003.\n\nHe has since taken home seven Grammys, including for song of the year.\n\nIn 2006, Ciara was nominated for best new artist alongside Fall Out Boy, Legend, Keane, and Sugarland.\n\nLegend left with the award, but Ciara didn't go home empty-handed. That night, she won the best short-form music video award for her feature on Missy Elliott's song \"Lose Control.\"\n\nAfter her hugely successful Eras Tour, it's hard to imagine a time when Swift didn't win the title of best new artist at the Grammys.\n\nHowever, when she was nominated in 2008, the award went to Amy Winehouse.\n\nSince then, Swift has won 14 Grammys. She is the only artist in history to win album of the year four times.\n\nIn 2009, the Jonas Brothers were in a tight race for best new artist alongside Adele, Duffy, Jazmine Sullivan, and Lady A.\n\nAdele took home the prize, but the Jonas Brothers have gone on to have an extremely successful career.\n\nAlthough they've yet to win a Grammy, they've been nominated for two.\n\nAlthough Drake now has five Grammys under his belt, he lost best new artist to jazz musician Esperanza Spalding in 2011.\n\nLike Drake, Bieber also lost the award for best new artist to Esperanza Spalding.\n\nHe's since taken home two Grammys and earned 27 nominations.\n\nIn 2012, Minaj lost out on the title of best new artist to indie-folk group Bon Iver. But Minaj made history that night as the first female rapper to perform solo at the Grammys.\n\nDespite being nominated 12 times, Minaj has yet to win a Grammy.\n\nAlthough Rolling Stone's Brian Hiatt called Lamar \"the greatest rapper alive\" in 2017, the musician didn't take home the award for best new artist in 2014.\n\nThe award went to Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. But since then, Lamar has earned a whopping 66 Grammy nominations and 22 wins.\n\nLike Lamar, Ed Sheeran was up for the award for best new artist in 2014.\n\nHe later went on to win two of his four Grammys in 2016.\n\nIn 2018, SZA was up against Khalid, Alessia Cara, Lil Uzi Vert, and Julia Michaels for best new artist. The honor went to Cara.\n\nSZA won her first Grammy in 2022 for collaborating with Doja Cat on the hit song \"Kiss Me More.\" She has since won a total of five Grammys.\n\nIn 2020, Rosalía was nominated for best new artist alongside names like Billie Eilish, Lizzo, Lil Nas X, and Maggie Rogers.\n\nAlthough Eilish walked away with the award, Rosalía made history that night as the first all-Spanish-language singer to be nominated in that category.\n\nShe was nominated in the same category at the 2017 Latin Grammys but didn't win.\n\nShe's since won two Grammys and 11 Latin Grammys.\n\nIn 2021, Doja Cat was nominated for best new artist. She lost to Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nShe didn't have to wait long for a Grammy win, though. She won her first in 2022 for \"Kiss Me More.\"\n\nIn 2025, Sabrina Carpenter was nominated for the award alongside artists like Chappell Roan, Benson Boone, Doechii, and Raye. However, the honor went to Roan.\n\nCarpenter still went home with two Grammys that night, including best pop vocal album and best pop solo performance.\n\nThis story was originally published in February 2024 and most recently updated on January 28, 2026.",

    "description": "A functional medicine doctor shared lifestyle habits that can boost metabolic health, such as strength training and getting better sleep.",
    "fullText": "How quickly your body burns fat can sometimes feel out of your control. For Dr. Adam Perlman, it's one of the biggest laments he's heard from patients.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many times I've had patients who have had so much trouble losing weight complain to me that their friends can eat whatever they want and never put weight on,\" Perlman, an integrative and functional medicine doctor and former chief medical officer for Mayo Clinic's integrative medicine program, told Business Insider.\n\nIt's also one of the biggest misconceptions he hears about metabolic health.\n\n\"Your genetics aren't your destiny,\" he said, even if they play a role. \"You can counter a lot of those genetics with the right type of interventions, particularly around lifestyle.\"\n\nLuckily, none of those involve eating less, the other big myth he hears around losing fat. \"Sometimes, if you restrict your diet too much, it really backfires because you go into this sort of scarcity state,\" he added.\n\nWhile he said it's important to speak to a doctor and rule out potential underlying issues of unexplained weight gain, like thyroid function, he said there are a few simple lifestyle changes everyone can make to boost their metabolic health and burn fat faster.\n\nFrom his experience, Perlman has seen people lean on heavy exercise, particularly cardio workouts, to shed fat fast.\n\nWhile aerobic exercise has other health benefits, he said that there isn't great evidence that movement alone will lead to drastic weight loss.\n\nStrength training, however, has its own metabolic benefits. Because muscle is a more metabolically active tissue, having higher muscle mass helps you burn more calories at rest over time.\n\nPerlman said he encourages strength training to his patients and performs a bioelectric scan to measure their body's composition of muscle and fat. He especially emphasizes it to older patients who may be going through hormonal changes, like during menopause, or experiencing a natural decrease in muscle mass.\n\n\"People begin to develop what they perceive as a slowing of metabolism, where part of the issue is that they're not maintaining their muscle mass the way they need to,\" he said. \"Making sure they're getting strength training is particularly Important.\"\n\nPerlman is particularly fascinated by newer science that links a slower metabolism to issues with your gut microbiome.\n\nCertain microbes, like the gut bacterium akkermansia muciniphila, thrive on fiber and polyphenols found in foods like raspberries and artichokes. Their byproducts can signal the body to release hormones that help regulate appetite and blood sugar.\n\nEating lots of ultra-processed foods can disrupt this cycle. But even if you follow the Mediterranean diet, you might still struggle with losing fat due to a lack of variety in your meals, he said.\n\n\"By and large, what you want is to make sure you eat the rainbow,\" he said. \"So a mix of different types of plants, which is really a mix of different types of fibers that the body tends to feed on.\"\n\nA lack of sleep disrupts your hormones, making it harder to lose fat.\n\nWhat's more, even a consistent sleep schedule during the work week won't make up for late nights on the weekend.\n\n\"A lot of people have what's called 'social jet lag,'\" Perlman said, where they go to bed at 10 p.m. on weekdays but 2 a.m. on Saturday nights. \"That really wreaks havoc on your health, on your microbiome, on other aspects of your health as well.\"\n\nFor Perlman, getting better sleep has been the most recent change he's made to boost his own metabolic health.\n\n\"If you came to my home, you'd see that we have blackout shades, I use a new noise machine at night, I turn the temperature down before I go to bed,\" he said. \"Sleep has been one that I've definitely been focused on.\"",

The group absorbed several other teams inside Cloud at a critical time for Google, which has been aggressively courting businesses with its AI products.\n\nShe joined from Microsoft, where she was a corporate vice president overseeing the go-to-market plan for its commercial segment.\n\nGallot's departure this week confused some staff inside Google Cloud who were surprised to see her leave after less than a year at the company, two employees told Business Insider. A spokesperson confirmed Gallot was leaving the company, but did not share more on the reasons for her departure. Gallot could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\"We have made incredible progress in evolving our GTM organization to meet the unique moment we have with our customers, our partners and across the industry,\" Renner wrote in the Tuesday memo.\n\nHave something to share?

    "description": "Being in an office with younger coworkers pushed me to use makeup and hair dye. In my 50s, a few tricks help me look younger and be confident at work.",
    "fullText": "I never imagined, at 58 years old, that I'd find myself watching video tutorials on how to apply eyeliner.\n\nI'd always had a bohemian, makeup-free vibe that had worked just fine when I was younger. I used to laugh at the idea of coloring gray hair and swore I'd never ever consider plastic surgery.\n\nOf course, those are easy positions to hold when you're in your teens and 20s. However, when you're staring 60 in the (somewhat wrinkly) face, it's a different story.\n\nThen one day, my company changed its remote work policy. Faced with the reality of going back to working with others in person, I realized I was in trouble.\n\nI knew I had to do something about my appearance … fast.\n\nThough I looked forward to seeing colleagues and collaborating IRL, I was worried.\n\nThe thing is, everyone on my team is younger than me. Some are much younger — in their 20s. Less than half my age. In our video calls, they all seem to have amazing makeup, hairstyle, and fashion skills that I don't.\n\nMy appearance had only gotten frumpier while working from home every day. In fact, I kind of let myself go.\n\nAt best, I wore a white blouse and black blazer paired with plaid pajama bottoms and fuzzy unicorn slippers. (Professional on top, naptime on the bottom.)\n\nSoft-focus filters on video calls helped me feel mostly fine with my appearance. It was a comfy lifestyle.\n\nI didn't want to go back to wearing real pants … or shoes with heels. However, I didn't have a choice. My team was about to see the real, unadulterated, unblurred, undyed me.\n\nIt was time to get serious about putting in some effort and making myself look better — and yes, trying to look younger.\n\nI knew I wasn't going to be able to do some kind of miraculous makeover in a few weeks, and I didn't want to look unrecognizable, either.\n\nIn desperation, I turned to generative AI. I asked ChatGPT for a color analysis so I could understand which shades of makeup and clothing would look best on me.\n\nI uploaded a headshot taken in natural light, without makeup. Then I used a photo-editing tool to pinpoint the hexadecimal colors in my face, hair, eyes, and lips.\n\nUsing those colors, I asked ChatGPT to detect my undertones and contrast and tell me which \"season\" of shades would flatter me most.\n\nBased on the analysis, I'm a \"soft autumn.\" I learned that my most flattering colors were shades like olive, sage, camel, rose, and terracotta.\n\nI discovered that I should try to keep my wardrobe and accessories warm and subtle — never stark or icy. I'd been wearing black and white my whole life, and apparently, it's not the best idea for my complexion.\n\nGood to know! I sorted my wardrobe accordingly. Now, if I wear a black or white shirt, I soften it with a rust-colored scarf or a sage sweater.\n\nI then turned to YouTube, which is a fountain of knowledge for finding a fountain of youth.\n\nAfter watching an overwhelming number of tutorials on how to put on makeup, I realized I'd been doing it wrong my whole life (when I did it at all).\n\nFor example, with eyeliner, I found out I should use go for a soft, smudgy look instead of a hard line or a winged shape if I want to best enhance my eyes.\n\nI also got my eyebrows threaded (ouch!) and bought an eyelash curler (ugh).\n\nAt my next salon visit, I got warm gold highlights to blend the gray in my hair with the brown. My stylist also showed me how a diffuser could give my hair bounce and body.\n\nI'd been fighting the natural wave of my hair all my life, but as I've gotten older, the waves have been winning. So I surrendered and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nWhen I walked back into the corporate world, in person, I felt a lot more confident. I felt I looked less like a crazy cat lady and more like a cool aunt.\n\nAnd when I told my team my real age, they all seemed gratifyingly shocked.\n\nIn the end, I made some incremental improvements that didn't cost much and gave me a great return on my investment. What's even more important is that these efforts feel sustainable.\n\nI can spend a few minutes in the evening choosing an outfit for the next day. I'm willing to devote more time in the morning doing makeup and hair. And it's certainly worth it to go to the salon for a cut and touch-up every few months.\n\nI'm still not wearing heels, though. You have to draw the line somewhere.",

    "fullText": "Redwood Materials has landed Google as a new investor, capping an upsized funding round that values the battery recycling and energy storage company at more than $6 billion.\n\nThe development underscores rising Big Tech interest in power infrastructure for the AI era.\n\nThe Nevada-based startup said Wednesday it completed the final close of its Series E financing, bringing the total raised to $425 million.\n\nThe round was increased from a previously announced $350 million amid strong investor demand. Google joined the final closing of the round alongside existing backers, including Capricorn and Goldman Sachs.\n\nGoogle's participation adds another tech giant to Redwood's cap table, following Nvidia's investment earlier in the round through its venture arm NVentures.\n\nThe growing interest reflects a bet that Redwood's energy storage business — which repurposes used electric-vehicle batteries to store power — could become critical infrastructure as electricity demand surges from AI, data centers, and broader electrification.\n\nFounded by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, Redwood Materials originally built its business on recycling lithium-ion batteries and recovering key metals, including lithium, nickel, and cobalt. More recently, it has expanded into grid-scale energy storage through a new unit called Redwood Energy, which uses second-life EV batteries to stabilize power supply and support energy-hungry data centers.\n\nThe company has argued that energy storage is no longer optional but essential as AI workloads strain existing grids. Redwood says the new capital will help it scale its energy storage platform while continuing to invest in recycling and critical minerals processing in the US.\n\nWith Google now on board, Redwood is positioning itself at the intersection of AI infrastructure, energy security, and domestic supply chains — a combination investors increasingly see as strategic as the power demands of the AI economy accelerate.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Sarah Turner explains how a midlife career shift led her husband to take on all domestic work, transforming their marriage and her career.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to-essay is based on a conversation with Sarah Turner, 49, who lives in Suffolk, UK. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always worked, even after having children, but like many women, I squeezed myself around my husband, Neil, who was the breadwinner, working in the insurance industry in London.\n\nBetween having our two daughters, who are now 22 and 18, I became a stay-at-home mom. I looked after the children and the house, and managed to shoehorn my own part-time career as a counsellor and therapist around that.\n\nThen in 2020, everything turned on its head. I wasn't very happy working at my job. Neil suggested I set up my own business. As I had supported him in his career, holding the fort at home, he recognized it was time to support me in mine.\n\nTalk about a role reversal. Neil went from one extreme to another. Before this, he would leave for work at 6:30 a.m. and come home at 8 p.m. He had been off the map in terms of home life. He wouldn't have been able to tell you what class the kids were in, where they had to be at any given time, what clubs they attended, or what was in the kitchen cupboards. He was purely focused on his career.\n\nThat disappeared overnight. Without question, Neil took on all the domestic responsibilities so I could focus full-time on my business and career. I've been growing my business ever since, to the point where I've been able to expand what I do to launch my \"Flourish Midlife\" online program for women ages 40 to 60.\n\nMany women who work full-time are still also worrying about everything else — the running of the house, the ferrying around of the children, while often also looking after their older parents. In some cases, it's worn like a badge of honor to be so busy and needed.\n\nI, on the other hand, have gone completely the other way. I don't cook. I don't clean. I don't do laundry. I don't get involved in anything domestic. And I'm completely shameless about it.\n\nNeil still works full-time in insurance, but now fully from home, so he can fit in personal things around his working day. He has a senior role managing a team, so he can be flexible, whereas it's a bit more difficult for me when I have clients to see and am not available outside that. He also saves four hours a day by not having to commute to the office anymore.\n\nSometimes, when I tell someone that I don't cook, they'll try to offer me a simple recipe, assuming I can't cook. I will then have to correct them and say, \"No, you've misunderstood me. I can cook. I choose not to because I've been there, done it.\"\n\nBefore, I was trying to do all of these things myself, but I've noticed I no longer feel resentful. This role reversal has brought us closer together because we now discuss more aspects of our home lives, whereas previously I would have just taken charge, which is good for our relationship in lots of ways. We respect each other a lot, and we were also keen to role model this new dynamic to our girls. Because Neil is more capable than I ever gave him credit for, and I suspect other husbands are, too.\n\nI would say for anyone who was in my position and wants a change but feels a bit edgy about handing over all home and family responsibilities to their husband, perhaps delegate gradually. Keep communicating. You don't want anyone to feel like something is solely their responsibility. If my husband came to me and said he needed my help with something, I would, of course, do it. The thing with boundaries is they don't have to be rigid all the time — you can move them.\n\nBecause while I'm not feeling resentful anymore, and I'm in a joyous period of my life, I don't want Neil to become resentful, either. So we're always checking in with each other on how our work is doing and if we have enough gas in the tank.\n\nNeil is now more of a hands-on dad and husband than ever. And as for me, I'm flat out with a full caseload at work — and Neil is really supportive of that. He wants me to do well.",

The Nasdaq 100 also hit a record.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday:\n\nThe rally largely advanced on good news in the chips and semiconductors space.\n\nNvidia was up more than 1% on a report from Reuters that China has given the green light for several large firms to purchase the company's H200 AI chips.\n\nInvestors were also encouraged by strong earnings from non-US semiconductor firms. ASML and SK Hynix surged after the semiconductor firms issued robust guidance for 2026, which sent other chip and semiconductor stocks up across the board.\n\nHere were the notable moves in tech:\n\nMega-cap tech earnings were also helping boost sentiment, with investors waiting on results for Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft, three companies at the heart of the AI boom, after the close. Results for Apple are expected on Thursday.\n\nThe broader market churned higher as the investors looked ahead to the Fed's January rate decision. While markets are not expecting a rate-cut, investors seem to believe that strong earnings will help drive the next leg of the bull market, according to José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\n\n\"The risk-on attitude on Wall Street, amid a lack of hesitation to lift exposures, is emblematic of participants believing that the prints will deliver beats and raises overall, pointing to an extended runway ahead for AI,\" he wrote in a note.\n\n\"US stock indexes futures began Wednesday in bullish form.

    "description": "After college, my partner and I moved to New York City to live together and start our careers. I had no idea how much I'd miss living with my friends.",
    "fullText": "I still remember pulling out of the driveway of the house I'd shared with the same five girls for three years.\n\nI sat in the passenger seat, waving goodbye as my boyfriend drove away. We both cried, unable to fathom that college was really over.\n\nAs we road-tripped from Ann Arbor, Michigan, back to the Northeast (where we're both from), we felt excited for the next chapter of our lives — starting our careers in New York City and moving in together. But we were also going through our own forms of a breakup, just not with each other.\n\nMy housemates and I weren't just housemates. We were pandemic-era housemates, meaning we ate breakfast together at our tiny kitchen table every morning and took our remote classes from the same living room couch.\n\nMy boyfriend had a similar experience, living with friends in a house around the corner from mine.\n\nSomewhere along the way, both of our friend groups became like family, barging into each other's houses without notice and spending endless hours together.\n\nI had no idea just how much I'd miss that.\n\nJust one month after graduation, I had a cute, albeit tiny, apartment in Manhattan with swanky restaurants on each corner, a pickleball court nearby, and 24/7 access to pizza and bagels. And I was doing it all with my boyfriend by my side.\n\nI had achieved the dream so many Long Island-raised kids like myself had growing up.\n\nBut as much as I tried to romanticize my compact kitchen appliances and lack of windows (and consequently, sunlight), I longed for sunny days on my front porch in Ann Arbor with my five best friends sipping lattes out of mason jars, talking about absolutely nothing.\n\nMy boyfriend missed his version of this, too, sipping bottles of beer with his five housemates, talking mostly about football.\n\nWe both longed to be somewhere else. And I, for one, felt guilty.\n\nStruggling to adjust to our 9-to-5 schedules in a new city, we often found ourselves sitting around the apartment, lacking the energy to do all the fun things we used to love.\n\nI did make some new friends, but I struggled to put in the effort to maintain them. I often wondered if it was even possible to find the same level of friendship I had with my college housemates.\n\nI'd replay the highlight reel of memories in my mind — prank wars that would last for weeks, communicating with our next-door neighbors via handwritten signs taped to our windows, and nights in watching old One Direction music videos.\n\nAlthough we still kept in touch via our group chat, it just wasn't the same as waking up every morning to all my favorite people in one place.\n\nIt was as if I'd been living in my very own sitcom for three years — one that could never be recreated — with the perfect mix of characters, all in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnd like all sitcoms, it had to come to an end. I was holding out hope for a spinoff, but I had to let go.\n\nI realized that what I really needed most was time. There wasn't one thing in particular that magically made me stop missing my friends so much. It took about a year to adapt to my new routine and start feeling like myself again.\n\nIn the meantime, I let myself be sad, and I stopped feeling guilty about it. I leaned on the one person who understood my sadness on a personal level: my boyfriend.\n\nWe talked about missing our best friends, Ann Arbor, and our life together before we moved to New York City. It felt good to have someone who was going through the same thing.\n\nSlowly but surely, we adjusted to our new reality and started finding joy in the little things, like decorating our apartment, trying new bagel spots, and perfecting homemade vodka sauce.\n\nAs for my housemates, we continue to find unique ways to stay in touch. We partake in our own Secret Santa each year. We email each other life updates through personalized newsletters that are way too detailed. We schedule visits throughout the year and meet up around the country. Every time we do, it's like we're back home.\n\nOf course, I still miss them. But I've learned to cherish the people that are nearby — both new friends I've met in the city and old ones I grew up with back on Long Island. I've also made more of an effort to spend time with family. Thankfully, they're only a train ride away.\n\nTwo and a half years postgrad, my boyfriend and I still live together, but now we have a new apartment with a full-sized oven and more windows to let in plenty of sunlight.\n\nWe see our best friends a few times a year and spend the remaining 300-and-something days trying to convince them all to move to New York.

    "title": "I backpacked around Europe for 6 months. Here are the items I couldn't live without — and the ones I wish I'd left behind.",
    "description": "I spent six months traveling Europe with two backpacks, and loved having things like a portable white-noise machine and flat travel pouches with me.",
    "fullText": "Packing for a six-month trip around Europe wasn't easy. I deliberated for a good two months about what to take with me and what to leave behind. Since I only had two backpacks, I had to be picky about what I brought.\n\nNow that I'm back home, I'm able to reflect on the items I took with me. Here are the three things that now have a permanent spot in my luggage and the two that won't make the cut next time.\n\nNoisy neighbors and loud city streets are part of the traveling experience. Although some people like to counteract these things with earplugs, I've always found them uncomfortable as a side sleeper.\n\nSo, I brought a mini white-noise machine to drown out any music, traffic, or chatter. The little cylinder was quite loud for its size, and did a great job of masking any background noise.\n\nI definitely had more restful sleep because of it, and it's now an essential for all my future trips.\n\nI find the traditional hard-plastic travel containers for liquids to be quite clunky. So, for this trip, I bought a pack of flat travel pouches in different sizes.\n\nI used the bigger bags for shampoo and body wash and the smaller ones for face wash and conditioner. I'd then refill them from larger bottles purchased during my longer stays.\n\nAlthough they took a little more patience to fill, these pouches stacked up much more neatly than the bulky travel bottles I used to use.\n\nI typically won't wear a pair of earrings or a bracelet if I can't physically see it. This presents a problem for many bag-like travel containers where the jewelry isn't laid out neatly.\n\nWhen I researched other travel-jewelry options, I found that many were large and bulky, which wouldn't bode well for my limited space.\n\nHowever, I saw a hack online about using a foldable pill box to store jewelry. I ordered one immediately and found it to be the perfect solution.\n\nWhile packing for my trip, my mind went to everything I'd have to charge: my laptop, smartwatch, phone, and white-noise machine.\n\nSo, I purchased a travel power strip/adapter with three ports and a long cord. I figured I'd be set for all my charging needs.\n\nIn practice, however, this big rectangle ended up being a nuisance. It was incredibly bulky, and if I plugged two or more things into it, a spark would shoot off from the plug.\n\nI ended up throwing it out and replacing it with a high-quality cube adapter. This much-lighter converter had a three-prong port and several USB slots, which suited my needs just fine.\n\nIf anything, I'd bring two cube adapters next time to have one in the bedroom and one in the living room.\n\nThis story was originally published on February 4, 2025 and most recently updated on January 28, 2026.",

    "title": "Meet the fans fueling a billion-dollar boom in escapist 'micro dramas' full of werewolves and mafia bosses",
    "description": "Micro dramas, often adapted from Chinese web novels, are finding fans with soapy stories and actor-fan engagement.",
    "fullText": "Michelle Bickford, a 49-year-old therapist in Denver, stopped subscribing to cable TV a few years ago. Instead, she pays up to $300 a month to watch soaps about werewolves, vampires, and more on her phone.\n\n\"It's a good way to escape from the real world for an hour,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nMicro dramas, also called short dramas or verticals, are made-for-mobile movies — presented in bite-sized episodes — that first became popular in China and now have exploded in the US. Micro drama apps made an estimated $1.4 billion in US revenue in 2025, according to the streaming consulting firm Owl & Co.\n\nWith titles like \"No Escape from the Mafia King's Embrace\" and \"My Sister is the Warlord Queen,\" Hollywood purists have looked on with morbid curiosity, but many out-of-work actors and filmmakers have embraced the paycheck and experience.\n\nFueling their popularity in the US are the fans who are paying to watch them. Micro dramas mostly make money by charging for tokens that unlock episodes and through subscriptions for unlimited viewing. Advertising makes up the rest, though it's generally a smaller slice of revenue.\n\nLeading app ReelShort has said users typically pay $5 to $10 a week. In a November survey of fans, around 30% said they paid between $25 and $100 a month, and about 27% said they paid nothing. (Many apps offer the option to watch ads to unlock new episodes, and some fans find pirated versions uploaded to free video-sharing platforms like Dailymotion.)\n\nThe survey, conducted by Jen Cooper, an independent, UK-based vertical drama consultant, used responses from 1,670 micro drama fans to glean insights into the community. The survey was self-selecting, which could partly explain why respondents tended to be heavy watchers — most said they watched daily, often for 1 to 3 hours. Ninety-four percent of the respondents were women, and 53% were ages 35 to 54.\n\nIn interviews with Business Insider, fans regularly described micro dramas as a way for them to relax and escape the stress of current events or difficult personal situations.\n\nBickford said her vertical fandom kicked off around the time of the 2024 US presidential election, starting with a show called \"You Belong with Me\" about a woman taking revenge on her cheating fiancé. Bickford said she's not a fan of Trump and \"had to get away from listening to all that nonsense.\" She's watched about 1,500 series since then — recording each one on a spreadsheet to keep track.\n\nWhile 84% of fans surveyed by Cooper said they subscribed to other paid streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, some told Business Insider that micro dramas had replaced much of their traditional viewing.\n\nMelissa Dominguez, 41, a life coach and house manager in the San Francisco Bay Area, said she stopped subscribing to Paramount+ and Hulu after she discovered micro dramas on platforms like ReelShort and Dailymotion last year. She said she still subscribes to Netflix, but only for her family's sake.\n\nFans said they don't watch micro dramas because they're high art. They love them in spite of — and perhaps because of — the sometimes bad acting and outlandish storylines. Many of the plots come from Chinese web novels that have been adapted to the screen and localized, though producers are also ordering original stories to feed the strong demand. The format — feature-length films cut up into episodes of a minute or two, each bound by a cliffhanger — is a product of the mobile phone era.\n\nSome fans said they find it relatable to see bullies getting their comeuppance or satisfying to see the underdog win. They like the immediacy of the phone and can count on the stories getting tied up with neat, happy endings.\n\nDominguez knows she'll get eye rolls when she tells people she watches verticals. As silly as they might seem, they provide an escape and a chance to see a resolution to conflict, she said.\n\n\"It's the same reason people love reality TV and Marvel,\" she said. \"I enjoy revenge movies. People can relate to being cheated on, someone talking behind their back.\"\n\nFor 29-year-old fan Robert Segura, a social media manager in Los Angeles, the acting can be \"kind of up and down,\" which made it feel more realistic to him. He compared them to fast-paced action movies with wild scenarios of the early aughts, such as \"Charlie's Angels,\" that he enjoyed.\n\nThere are also similarities between verticals and escapist entertainment from earlier periods, such as the Great Depression, which gave us \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Frankenstein.\"\n\n\"The world is in crisis, and people are looking for dopamine,\" said Isabel Dréan, a micro drama producer and author of \"How to Write a Vertical Series in 10 Days.\"\n\nA big part of micros' appeal is the interaction they allow with the actors and among fans in a way that prestige TV and film, with their velvet ropes, often don't. It's not unlike the booming creator economy, which is rooted in fan interaction.\n\nOnline communities have sprung up around vertical cast members, often early-career actors who will pop into online chats with viewers and meet them at fan festivals like VertiCon.\n\nIn Cooper's survey, 93% said the star was the biggest factor in their decision of what to watch, way ahead of genre at 50%. And 61% said they'd watch anything their favorite actor is in, regardless of what it was about.\n\nSandi Nascimento, a 45-year-old medical worker from Long Island, NY, runs an Instagram fan page for popular actor Eric Guilmette, who occasionally participates. She hopes to meet him in person eventually.\n\n\"It's pretty cool — I can't message Sylvester Stallone,\" she said.\n\nFans are vocal about aspects of micro dramas they don't like as well.\n\nThe plots often rely on violence and misogyny, and on women being rescued to propel the action forward. Such themes are a common complaint among fans, with 57% of respondents in Cooper's survey saying there was too much violence.\n\n\"I think the fans are starting to say, 'We don't like these kinds of storylines,'\" Bickford said. \"A woman getting slapped 20 times is not something that's needed. In chats, we've all pretty much said, 'Don't watch this one because there's too much violence.'\"\n\n\"I think it's the fantasy,\" ReelShort watcher Susan Jacobs Corria, 70, a retired sales rep living in Providence, RI, said of the appeal of such rescue storylines. \"A lot of people are shut in. They're living vicariously. I think it is regressive.\"\n\nIn interviews, execs at leading apps ReelShort and DramaBox have said they strictly follow the audience data in making content decisions. Five producers tell Business Insider that they and actors are starting to push back on violence and sexism in plots.\n\nMicro dramas also get called out for being habit-forming, even addictive. In Cooper's survey, 56% said they were surprised at how much money they'd spent on micro dramas. The survey also found that fans felt overwhelmed by the number of apps, as well as confusing pricing options, poor app design, and performance glitches. Viewer loyalty to specific apps is low. ReelShort and DramaBox are the best known, but fans often jump among dozens of other apps, rack up coins by watching ads, or seek out free options like YouTube or Dailymotion.\n\n\"You really have to learn how to navigate the vertical apps,\" Jacobs Corria said. She manages to watch by accumulating credits on the apps by watching ads.\n\n\"I've been watching three years, and I've never spent a penny,\" she said.\n\nHollywood stalwarts like Disney and Fox are crowding into the space now, seeing the time and money vertical dramas are garnering. Cooper said that the established apps and newer ones alike are experimenting with original scripts and fresh genres.\n\nMany viewers are ready for change.\n\nRomantic comedies and romantic dramas are still the most in-demand genres, but fans are also crying for more strong female leads (77% in Cooper's survey) and culturally diverse characters (54%). They also want to see more same-sex stories, people with disabilities, and genres like mystery and horror.\n\n\"I've watched a lot of werewolves, billionaire CEOs, mistaken identity ones,\" Nascimento said. \"I hope they broaden their horizons. I'd like to see other tropes.\"\n\nJacobs Corria said she's cut way back on verticals while awaiting storylines with less violence.\n\n\"I'm building up my coins,\" she said. \"I'm definitely not done with the format.\"",

    "description": "Rebecca Reed, an 87-year-old church secretary in New Orleans, reflects on raising her grandchildren after her daughter's death and the impact it had.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rebecca Reed, 87, who works as a church secretary and an editorial assistant in New Orleans. Reed previously spoke with Business Insider about her desire to retire. This article is a follow-up on her experience raising her grandchildren and the toll it took on her. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy saying is \"Do not spoil your grandchildren because they could come back to live with you, and you're going to have a problem.\" I ended up raising my grandchildren after both their parents died.\n\nTheir father died in 2003. He was in his early 40s, and he died from cancer. The kids saw this, and it was awful. They say people don't die of broken hearts, but I think this was a terrible thing for their mother and my daughter, my only child. She died a little over a year later in 2004.\n\nI don't have much time with my grandchildren anymore. They're all grown up now, do their own things, and go on trips. I'm always invited, but I can't join because I'm still working.\n\nThey were 13 and 11 at the time. My husband and I raised the two kids as their legal guardians. My husband was still working. It was like we had two houses.\n\nI was hurting, and these kids were too. They just didn't show it the way I did. They were rebelling in some ways, and I held it all inside. Our thinking is so far out compared to theirs. My husband was in his 70s, and I was in my late 60s. I couldn't raise these kids the way I raised my own children.\n\nI was driving all over the city with them. It was the weirdest thing because I hadn't done that in so long. In PTA meetings, the teachers were looking at me, a gray-haired lady, probably thinking of what I was doing here with all these young people.\n\nI had books at home about grandparents raising grandchildren. There was also an organization called Grandparents Raising Grandchildren at a local Jewish community center in New Orleans that I went to. For many of the other grandparents who were raising their grandchildren, their children were on drugs or had abandoned them. It was quite different from my situation, but it still helped a lot.\n\nI don't even know how I lived through it. I had plenty of problems. I love my grandchildren, and thank God they turned out all right.\n\nAfter about a year and a half of raising them, I realized you have to let a lot of things go and pick your battles. You can't always make it work the way you want, and I had to stop stressing myself out about it. I let them get away with a little more than I did with my daughter.\n\nWe gave them whatever they wanted because we were still their grandparents. We would give them an allowance. That was the way it was before their parents died.\n\nA lot of times, they didn't take us seriously. I had to set some rules, whether it was telling them to do their homework, not to be out past midnight, or not to drive my car.\n\nWhen they wanted phones and said that everyone had phones, I said that wasn't true. That ticked them off, but my husband heard all of this. One day, I'm at work, and it's his day off. I got a phone call from my grandson saying he just got a new phone. I went berserk about that. My husband was still in the grandparent stage and would give them whatever they wanted.\n\nHe even got my grandson a mouse because he wanted to raise one. I was ready to throw both of them out of the house.\n\nWe had a limited income for a while because we spent most of it on essentials.\n\nTo raise children, you need so much help, so much information, and so much money. The good thing is that my daughter had a life insurance policy, and I was the beneficiary. We couldn't have afforded what they needed without that. I'm not sure how other people manage.\n\nThat was enough for me to get them into private schools and get them uniforms. The money also paid for my granddaughter's college education. She's a CPA now with a master's degree. My grandson didn't want to enroll in college, but he now has a wonderful events job.\n\nWith all the shenanigans that went on, it's amazing to see that they're just two amazing people now.\n\nPeople tell me that I did a wonderful job with them. I say that the only wonderful job I did was keeping myself sane. Everything fell into place after a while.\n\nMy husband died in 2011. I went back to work around then. I had to file for bankruptcy soon after, because I couldn't pay the bills. I now earn $12 an hour working part-time as a church secretary and part-time as an editorial assistant. I don't want to work, but I have to.\n\nI try to go to as many family events as I can, but sometimes I have to leave early because I've got to go to work.\n\nI'm still absolutely, without a doubt, very close to my grandchildren. I remembered when my granddaughter graduated with her master's, and one of the speakers asked parents to stand up. Some friends were there and were nudging me to stand. I said I'm just their grandparent. They made me stand up. I am their parent in a way, but I wish their parents could've been there.\n\nMy grandson is getting married this year, and my granddaughter got married two years ago. She's now talking about having a baby, and I would like not to be working at all when that happens. I want to be the babysitter.\n\nAt 90, I'm retiring from work no matter what. I don't know if I'll be able to even pick up a baby at that age. I really hope I'm around for that because that would be icing on the cake.",

    "fullText": "Silver prices have soared, but one prominent market strategist thinks the rally's days are numbered.\n\nMarko Kolanovic, the former quant chief at JPMorgan, predicts that the precious metal is on the verge of a plunge that could tank its price by half.\n\nKolanovic, who left JPMorgan in 2024, recently shared his view on the red-hot silver market, stating that he sees a major decline as a near-certainty.\n\nThe rush into precious metals has pushed both silver and gold to historic highs. A cocktail of geopolitical worries, central bank buying, and a general sense of FOMO among investors chasing the gains has helped drive the rally since the beginning of 2025.\n\nBut Kolanovic says the bulls should brace for a reversal.\n\n\"Silver is almost guaranteed to drop ~50% from these levels within a year or so,\" he said in a post on X. \"Historically episodes in commodities or various speculative assets point to that.\"\n\nKolanovic added that, despite this bearish conviction, he still sees betting against silver as risky, citing the high market-to-market risk for short sellers.\n\nThe strategist said that commodity bubbles often fall harder than narrative-driven hype assets, as real-world forces tend to push back and cause reversals.\n\n\"Unlike purely fictitious assets like NFTs, bubble in commodity can't last long - industry demand dries up, supply e.g. recycling increases, and new production is hedged,\" he added.\n\nSilver has blown past $100 per ounce in recent weeks, while gold has topped $5,000 for the first time, but more commentators have been growing cautious.\n\nPeter Brandt, a prominent futures and commodities trader, has raised similar concerns regarding silver recently. In a post on X, he issued a stark warning for investors about previous rallies that didn't end well.\n\n\"Today nearly 2 years of world production traded on world exchanges,\" he noted. \"More than 1.5 billion ounces. The last time such a proportion traded was Apr 25, the day of the 2011 top.\"",

    "description": "JPMorgan and Bank of America will match the government's one-time contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts.\"",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan and Bank of America are among the latest financial firms to commit to contributing to \"Trump Accounts\" for the kids of US-based employees.\n\nThe banks announced on Wednesday that they will match the government's one-time $1,000 contribution to investment accounts for newborns, known as \"Trump Accounts,\" for the children of their employees. Their announcements coincide with a \"Trump Accounts Summit,\" where President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are speaking.\n\nFor JPMorgan, the news comes just one week after the president sued the bank and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, for $5 billion over allegations of politically motivated debanking. A source familiar with the bank's move said that the firm has been planning the contributions since Trump Accounts were announced in June.\n\nJPMorgan employs more than 190,000 people in the United States alone, Dimon said in a press release about the announcement.\n\n\"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely, and plan for their family's financial future,\" he said in the release.\n\nBank of America shared the news in an internal memo, reviewed by Business Insider, to its 165,000 US employees. In addition to matching the contributions, the bank will allow \"eligible teammates\" with kids to make pretax contributions to the accounts via payroll deductions.\n\n\"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate,\" the memo said.\n\nThe banks join a list of companies that have committed to matching their employees' $1,000 contributions to Trump Accounts for their children, including BlackRock and Charles Schwab. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon attended a White House roundtable in June and expressed support for the plan.\n\nThrough the program, the Treasury-funded accounts are available to every American citizen born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year, and the program will start on July 4, 2026. It's one of many initiatives Trump has touted during his second term to give Americans free money, some of which haven't come to fruition.\n\nIn December, Michael and Susan Dell partnered with the Trump Accounts initiative and committed to contributing $250 to the accounts of 25 million American children, totaling a $6.25 billion donation from their charitable fund. Children aged 10 and younger who were born before January 1, 2025, and live in a ZIP code with a median income of $150,000 or less are eligible for the money. \n\nBillionaire Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, also announced plans to donate $250 to about 300,000 children in Connecticut living in zip codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less.",

Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated as part of these changes, and your employment will end after a notification period.\"\n\nThe notice states employees will receive support in the following ways:\n\nInternal Slack messages viewed by Business Insider suggest impacted teams include those within the company's Amazon Web Services cloud unit, such as the AI cloud service Bedrock, the cloud data warehouse service Redshift, and the ProServe consulting team, as well as retail business teams such as the Prime subscription service and the last-mile Delivery Experience team.\n\nThis round of layoffs is the latest mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce represents a relatively small share of that total, at roughly 350,000 employees.\n\nAmazon didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nI have some important, but difficult, news to share with you. After a thorough review of our organization, our priorities, and what we need to focus on going forward, we've made the hard business decision to eliminate some roles across Amazon. Unfortunately, your role is being eliminated as part of these changes and your employment will end after a notification period.\n\nThese decisions weren't made lightly, and we recognize the significant impact they have. We're committed to supporting you through this transition with:\n\nA non-working period with your full pay and benefits\n\nA severance package offer and transitional benefits\n\nExternal job placement support and 12 months of complimentary access to AWS Skill Builder\n\nAs of now, you are no longer required to perform work on Amazon's behalf and will continue to receive your full pay and benefits for the next 90 days.\n\nYou likely have questions, and we're here to answer them. You'll soon receive an invitation to schedule a conversation with a leader and/or HR point of contact from your team to discuss the specifics of your transition and how we can best support you. While this meeting is optional, we encourage you to attend virtually as it provides an opportunity to address your individual questions. Additionally, you'll receive a separate email from Amazon - Enterprise Document Management (notifications@atoz.amazon.work) with your formal announcement paperwork by the end of the day today. Please note that your badge access has been restricted; so, if you're currently in an Amazon office, Security can assist you with exiting the building.\n\nDuring your non-working transition period, you'll continue to have access to internal email, Chime, and A to Z on your personal device, and our primary mode of communication with you will be through email. Please keep your YubiKey to access email on a personal laptop/computer.\n\nWe encourage you to take time now to confirm that you have access to these tools on your personal device and that your personal email address is up to date in A to Z. You can find more information about installing A to Z, connecting to MyHR, and accessing Chime and email on this page.\n\nWe appreciate that this is a difficult update to receive and have shared answers to some of the most common questions related to your pay, benefits, support resources, and next steps below. Remember that caring team members are ready to assist you 24/7 through MyHR or the Employee Assistance Portal (EAP), offering free and confidential support, both available within A to Z.\n\nI'm personally committed to making sure you get the help you need as you navigate this change.

    "description": "It's nearly impossible for outsiders to understand how a platform works, whether that's TikTok, Google, or anything else. Skepticism makes sense.",
    "fullText": "Say a Trump-friendly group of owners bought TikTok, and wanted to change the way TikTok worked — so it showed more stuff that was Trump-friendly, and less that wasn't.\n\nHow would they go about doing that?\n\nI'm no engineer, but I would think that would be a pretty difficult project. You'd need to do it pretty subtly, over an extended time period, so people wouldn't notice it right away. Right?\n\nWrong, say some people who use TikTok. They point to Sunday, when TikTok stopped showing anything related to the death of Minneapolis protester Alex Pretti. They also note that at one point, TikTok prohibited users from using the word \"Epstein\" in direct messages to each other. And some TikTok creators insist that anti-Trump posts they created weren't getting the same distribution they used to.\n\nAnd all of this, they say, is related to the fact that late last week, a group of companies from the US and Abu Dhabi took control of (some of) TikTok's US operations, via a deal brokered by the Trump administration.\n\nThe new US TikTok says that's not the case. It says its entire operation was screwed up Sunday because one of Oracle's data centers had an outage. (TikTok didn't formally identify Oracle in its statements, but on Tuesday night, Oracle raised its hand and acknowledged that it was the \"US Data Center partner\" TikTok was referring to. Oracle now owns 15% of the new US TikTok.) It also says the Epstein direct message issue was a bug it is fixing, though it hasn't described how the bug came to be.\n\nAnd all of that seems pretty plausible to me.\n\nOn Saturday, my feed was full of posts about the latest killing of a protester in Minneapolis by federal agents. And on Sunday, those were all gone — but so was everything else I normally saw on my TikTok, like Liverpool soccer highlights and copyright-violating clips of action movies and TV shows. Instead, I got clip after clip of videos extolling the virtues of Corvettes.\n\nBut on Monday, everything was back to normal: My TikTok was full of rage-inducing clips about Alex Pretti's death, including multiple ones where creators urged viewers to learn how to use guns to defend themselves from the government. And while I don't normally use TikTok's DM feature, or send messages about Jeffrey Epstein, I was able to do that without a problem on Tuesday.\n\nAll of which suggests that TikTok's answer — we had to unplug the machine and plug it back in, basically — sounds pretty plausible to me. And much more plausible than, \"The new US TikTok has immediately started censoring anti-Trump views.\"\n\nBut that's the theory that a bunch of high-profile people, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Chris Murphy, are running with.\n\nAnd while some of the people complaining may have a specific motivation for their complaints — both Newsom and Murphy are consistent critics of the Trump administration, for instance — it's easy enough to understand why people might think TikTok really is up to something.\n\nFor starters, one of the reasons US TikTok is no longer run entirely by ByteDance, its original owner, is because US lawmakers told us they were worried that China might influence what TikTok users saw in America. But now US TikTok is owned by Trump allies — most notably Oracle founder Larry Ellison — and Trump has made it clear that he wants media and tech companies to promote things he likes and demote things he doesn't. So it's not outrageous to believe that TikTok's new bosses might put their thumb on the scale for Trump.\n\nBut the bigger issue is that it's nearly impossible, from the outside, to understand why a platform's algorithm behaves the way it does. You can certainly make informed guesses, and you might be right. But you're still guessing, and your guessing is often informed by the way you think the platform should operate.\n\nConservatives, for instance, complained for years about the way Twitter and Facebook treated them — up until Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and Mark Zuckerberg pivoted to Trump in 2025. Digital publishers are consumed with the vagaries of Google Discover — the platform many of them are now dependent on for traffic referrals. Now, AI engines are the new target for bias claims.\n\nBut proving that something is up — one way or another — is just about impossible in any systemic way: Yes, maybe your latest post isn't getting the views your other posts used to get. But does that mean the platform is censoring you? Or just swapping out your free content for someone else's free content it thinks will perform better?\n\nEven more confounding for us outsiders: Sometimes we really do find out that a human being — not software — made a decision to push something out of sight on a platform they run. In 2020, Twitter, then run by Jack Dorsey, hid a New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop because the company believed it might be part of a disinformation plot against Joe Biden. (Twitter later reversed itself, and Dorsey apologized publicly.) Musk, after buying Twitter, reportedly told his engineers to boost his posts on his own platform.\n\nAnd we most certainly live in an era where trust in every institution is frayed. So when a big platform stops showing you what you want to see, there are plenty of reasons to think that something's afoot. So maybe one day we will find out that the new US TikTok really is trying to promote Trump and tamp down his foes. I don't think that's true now — but how can I tell, for sure?",

    "fullText": "I've lived just outside Greenville, South Carolina, for the past 11 years and can't imagine calling anywhere else home.\n\nNamed one of \"The South's Best Cities in 2025\" by Southern Living and one of \"Readers' 15 Favorite Cities in the US of 2025\" by Travel + Leisure, it's easy to see why the city has seemingly exploded in popularity.\n\nHere are six of my favorite things to do in and around Greenville.\n\nI don't need to go far to see a beautiful waterfall in Greenville. Falls Park on the Reedy is a gorgeous green space in the middle of downtown, and the Reedy River weaves through it.\n\nFor the best views, I like to either walk across the Liberty Bridge (a curved suspension bridge overlooking the falls) or sit on a swing in the park while enjoying some ice cream from Jeni's.\n\nFor an adventure that's a bit further from the city, I drive about 45 minutes out to Jones Gap State Park to hike the Rainbow Falls trail. It leads to a stunning waterfall that plunges about 100 feet over a granite cliff.\n\nLocated next to the city's local airport are two of my family's favorites: Runway Park and Takeoff Mini Golf.\n\nRunway Park has an aviation-themed playground, complete with a short, paved runway trail that kids love to ride their bikes and scooters around. There are also two picnic areas available to rent for events.\n\nMeanwhile, Takeoff Mini Golf is a 19-hole course that's aviation-themed, too. Fun fact: If you get a hole-in-one on the last shot, a beacon will light up.\n\nWhat's great about both places is that you can actually see the airplanes taking off and landing while you're there.\n\nGreenville is home to a number of festivals, and some of my favorites are Artisphere, held annually on Mother's Day weekend, and Fall for Greenville, held each year in October.\n\nArtisphere highlights the work of artists around the country, lining Main Street with everything from handmade ceramics and paintings to sculptures and photography.\n\nOne of my favorite art pieces I've ever purchased — a stunning shot of the synchronous fireflies in the Great Smoky Mountains — was from a photographer at Artisphere. Plus, there are live performances and great food.\n\nMeanwhile, Fall for Greenville features live entertainment and food from local restaurants. Years ago at the festival, I was introduced to the restaurant Soby's, and now I always recommend it to visitors.\n\nThe Roper Mountain Science Center is home to the Dinosaur Adventure Trail, which has a variety of life-size dinosaur models.\n\nIt's hilarious to sit near the T. rex and watch as unsuspecting guests are shocked when it moves as they walk by.\n\nThe trail is open most of the summer and on Thursdays and Fridays throughout the school year, with tickets required.\n\nGreenville is a sleeper foodie destination that's about to land on the map when the next season of \"Top Chef\" drops, featuring episodes filmed in the city.\n\nTo experience Greenville's food scene in person, I recommend taking the \"At the Chef's Table\" culinary tour with Greenville History & Culinary Tours.\n\nI did this a year after moving to the area, and it helped me learn about the city's interesting history and where to find great food.\n\nThe tour includes visits to local restaurants — including one of my favorites, The Lazy Goat (the whole branzino and any of the desserts are incredible) — with explanations of the dishes from the chefs.\n\nBeyond the tour, I also love the burgers and garlic Parmesan fries at Windy City Burgers on E Coffee Street.\n\nLess than an hour's drive from downtown Greenville is the Fred W. Symmes Chapel (more commonly known as Pretty Place), home of the most stunning sunrise I've ever seen.\n\nThe chapel overlooks the Blue Ridge Mountains, and watching the sun streak through the clouds is an amazing experience.\n\nBe sure to check the online schedule for operating hours, since it's also a popular venue for weddings.",

The chain's stock opened 9% higher after it reported its first comparable transaction increase in the US in eight quarters.\n\nEven Niccol himself appears to be getting in on the protein craze. On Wednesday's call, the CEO said that he \"might have started my day with a vanilla protein latte.\"\n\nThe key, he said, is getting the word about the offering to more people.\n\n\"Awareness is still pretty surprisingly low, but the trial and the repeat rates are really, really great — meaning, when someone tries it, we see a high level of repeat, and it has proven to be highly incremental,\" Niccol said. \"So this is one we want to keep doing.\"",

    "fullText": "Amazon is cutting 16,000 corporate roles, and an internal FAQ viewed by Business Insider spells out the details for affected employees.\n\nThis round of layoffs is the second mass job cut since October, when Amazon shed 14,000 roles. The moves are part of a broad effort by the company to operate more efficiently amid rapid advances in AI. Amazon didn't respond to requests for further comments on the job cuts.\n\nEmployees who received a layoff notification will receive full pay and benefits for 90 days plus an additional severance package, and are no longer expected to perform any work, according to the document.\n\nAmazon's public announcement stated that the company is offering most US-based employees 90 days to search for a new role internally. The FAQ states affected employees are \"welcome to apply for available roles through the internal process\" during the 90-day notification period.\n\nThe FAQ is below. Business Insider removed Amazon login guidance from this FAQ to avoid disclosing security-related details.\n\nBelow are answers to some of the most common questions related to your pay, benefits, support resources, and next steps. To review additional FAQs, log into A to Z via mobile app or browser > Go to 'Quick Links' section and click on 'My HR' > View All Help Categories > My Employment > Leaving Amazon > Reduction in Force\n\nQ.

I am currently on a leave of absence, or I need to take a leave of absence during the notification period. How does that impact me?\n\nA: You may request and take approved leaves of absence during the notification period. However, leaves of absence will end as of your separation date.\n\nQ: What is the severance package?\n\nA: If your role is eliminated, the formal announcement paperwork you receive within the next 24 hours will have the details of how your severance package is calculated. Generally, you will receive: Your full pay and benefits during the transition period, and you will be offered a severance package. To receive your severance payment, you will be required to sign and return the severance and release agreement. We will send this to your personal email address on file no less than ten days after your separation date.\n\nQ: When will my benefits coverage end?\n\nA: Medical, vision, dental and other benefits will generally continue through the last day of the month in which your employment ends, unless you are a part-time or seasonal employee, in which case your benefits will end in accordance with the applicable policy. You may also be eligible for transitional benefits coverage as outlined in your severance documentation. For specific questions about your benefit end dates and transitional coverage, please contact My HR (log into A to Z via the mobile app or browser > Go to 'Quick Links' section and click on 'MyHR').\n\nQ: I have personal belongings at the office. How do I retrieve them?\n\nA: We want to ensure your personal belongings are handled according to your preferences. To help us coordinate this process efficiently, please complete our brief Personal Belongings Survey by clicking the link. This survey will allow you to specify how you'd like your desk/locker items handled, provide shipping information, and note any special instructions for fragile or sensitive items.

You can access internal job postings via A to Z (log into A to Z via mobile app or browser and click on 'Internal jobs' tile on the A to Z Homepage).\n\nQ: What resources are available to help find my next role outside of Amazon?\n\nA: You will have access to outplacement support from Lee Hecht Harrison (LHH). This support includes 1:1 career coaching with a dedicated LHH Career Coach, resume and comprehensive CV writing, interview preparation, skill development, referrals to hiring managers, targeted job leads, and external salary negotiation advice.

    "description": "When I went on a work trip, I was surprised by how relaxed I was without my kids and husband. I then encouraged him to go on his own solo trip.",
    "fullText": "When I traveled to a freelance writing conference in 2018, I was excited to network with other writers. But I was even more enthralled with the idea of shucking morning day care drop-offs, cooking dinner, washing dishes, and changing diapers for a few days.\n\nThis work trip was my first time away from my husband and my two young kids, who were 4 and 2 years old at the time. I learned a lot about writing, but the bigger lesson was that it's OK to take a break from life and do something for myself.\n\nThe carefree feeling felt so good that I encouraged my husband to take his own solo trip, and now we do this at least twice a year.\n\nMy husband, Don, and I have been married for 13 years. We both love to travel, but we don't always enjoy visiting the same places or doing the same activities.\n\nHe's a beach person; I'm a mountains girl. He loves being on the water (or in it), while I prefer to be near the water. He fishes and scuba dives — two things I have no interest in.\n\nI could spend a whole day roaming around a new town looking at scenery and doing touristy things; Don will humor me, but it's not his vibe.\n\nWhen we travel together, we each compromise with the other on food and activities. This also means we might not get the full experience of the place we're visiting. Taking separate vacations lets us control our own journeys without sacrifice. It also allows my husband to travel more, since he receives more paid time off than I do.\n\nParenting can be physically and mentally exhausting. When Don and I travel together, our parental duties don't disappear. But on a solo trip, the traveling parent gets to fully immerse themselves in the experience.\n\nFor my solo trips, I usually spend a weekend in the mountains writing, shopping, and sightseeing. Don goes on fishing trips with his dad in Florida a few times a year.\n\nThis was the biggest benefit that stood out to me at my writing conference. I only had to care for myself. I felt relaxed, focused, and less stressed. It was the break from routine I didn't know I needed, and even though I was traveling for work, the effects felt like a vacation.\n\nWhile I was gone, my husband handled 100% of the parenting. This included tasks he wasn't used to doing alone, or at all. It gave him a new perspective on how our household runs. At one point, he mentioned he didn't realize how much work was involved in our day-to-day lives and expressed his appreciation for all I do.\n\nI had a similar experience when he visited his father for a week. While he was gone, I had to prepare for freezing temperatures and possible power outages. It was a challenge storm-prepping alone, and I was a bit fearful of the unknown.\n\nOver the years, we've improved at flying solo for short periods. Most importantly, we're happy to allow the other to enjoy an occasional break. We each use our time away to recharge and return with a fresh mindset, more energy, and a little more appreciation for the other and the role we each play in our family.\n\nWhile Don and I enjoy our solo travels, we also invest in two or three family vacations each year. It might be a week at the beach, a weekend in the mountains, or half of a week visiting somewhere we've never been. One thing we can all agree on is hiking.\n\nTraveling together gives us time to bond as a family and make priceless memories, even if it means making concessions so everyone gets something out of the experience.\n\nMarriage is give-and-take, and we're both willing to give the other space and take on the full parental duties for a few days. It's always been worth it.",

    "description": "Color drenching can be a fun way to bring personality to your home, but interior designers caution that it's easy to get wrong.",
    "fullText": "In case you missed it, the sad beige trend has been on its way out of interior design for months now. As more people find ways to move away from the neutral look in their homes, some are leaning all in with one of 2026's biggest trends: color drenching.\n\nIf you're not familiar, \"color drenching\" is when people paint an entire room one hue, including the ceiling, wainscotting, and any trim. It's a bold move, but it can be a transformative design choice when done well.\n\n\"When people were coming out of the neutral craze, they wanted to really commit to adding color back into their space,\" Taylor Simon, an interior decorator, told Business Insider. \"It started with maybe just an accent ceiling, and then people started committing to the full drench. I personally really love it.\"\n\nAli Michel, a lead designer at Living Oak Interior Design, said that the color not only draws people in but also shapes how the space feels.\n\n\"It helps small spaces feel bigger and makes a larger space feel cozier if it's a dark color,\" Michel said.\n\nAlthough it can be beautiful, Michel and Simon both cautioned that color drenching can be tricky to pull off. Here are some of the most common mistakes people make when attempting the trend.\n\nThanks to modern technology, some people skip physical color swatching before painting these days, opting to look at their potential paint on a computer screen instead. Michel and Simon said that's a big mistake for color drenching since the color will be so crucial to the space.\n\n\"Colors can look really different depending on where the room is in the house and how much light it's getting,\" Michel said.\n\nSimon said it's also important to look at the swatches at different times of day, tracking how it looks in different light, so you can truly get a sense of how the color will look in your home over time.\n\n\"I have actually made the mistake of color drenching one of my bedrooms, and I didn't test the lighting properly,\" she told Business Insider. \"It just did not read in the way that I wanted it to. I was rushed, and I did it, and I didn't love it.\"\n\n\"Learn from my mistakes,\" she added. \"Make sure that it's something that you really love.\"\n\nYou'll want to think about the size of the room you'll be color drenching. Both Michel and Simon said they prefer it in smaller rooms because the color can make it feel cozy and give the illusion of a larger space.\n\nOn the flip side, it might not be as effective in an open-concept space, as the paint wouldn't have as much visual impact as it would in a smaller room.\n\n\"I would not suggest it in open floor plans,\" Michel said. \"If it's a huge room and it has your kitchen and living room, color drenching just wouldn't make sense.\"\n\nAlthough you're painting the whole room one color, both Michel and Simon said using the same sheen on every surface may make the room feel flat.\n\n\"If you go all matte all the way around, it can fall a bit flat,\" Simon said. \"If you go high gloss around the entire room and the ceiling, it can be glare central. I would recommend doing maybe more matte on the walls, and then sheen on the ceiling.\"\n\nMichel agreed, saying her team prefers to use a satin sheen on millwork like trim or molding, a flat sheen on ceilings, and an eggshell sheen on walls.\n\n\"A high-gloss ceiling makes it a little bit more reflective, so if it's a dark room, that can help a lot to bring light,\" she added. \"Not thinking about the sheens would be one big mistake.\"\n\nThe color will be the focal point of the room, but you don't want to overlook the details that can take the space to the next level. For instance, Simon advised against leaving your outlets white if you're color drenching a space.\n\n\"With outlets, I would recommend trying to blend them in as much as possible,\" she said, noting that you paint them to match the drench hue or swap the covers for brass, nickel, or chrome to make them feel more intentionally designed.\n\nLikewise, you don't want to buy furniture that's all the same color as the walls, as it may detract from the overall look. There will already be enough of whatever color you choose, so you can use your furniture to create contrast.\n\n\"I would bring other visual interest in through different colors and patterns,\" Michel said. \"I would do a contrasting color on any window coverings, bring in velvets. I feel like when you already have a color-drenched room, that helps make it feel luxurious and elevated.\"\n\n\"Contrast is everything,\" Simon said. \"The more you can mix materials and colors, the better. Nothing screams 'I bought everything at the same place' like the matching furniture sets.\"\n\nColor drenching is a bold design choice, but both Simon and Michel warned that not fully embracing it can make it fall flat.\n\n\"A mistake that can happen is just not committing to the bit,\" Simon said. \"It's going to break the illusion if you have the walls and the ceiling painted, but then the trim or the door isn't. That stark white is going to really pop out even more.\"\n\n\"If you're going to do it, just go all the way,\" she added.\n\n\"You have to go bold,\" Michel agreed. \"I have never talked to a client who didn't like it after doing it. You kind of have to trust the process because it seems scarier before you do it.\"",

    "fullText": "​In the fiercely competitive market ​of the online multiplayer game, Highguard​’s rocky start means it now has a lot to prove\n\nDon’t get Pushing Buttons delivered to your inbox? \nIn the fast-paced, almost psychotically unforgiving video game business, you really do have to stick the landing. Launching a new game is an artform in itself – do you go for months of slowly building hype or a sudden shock reveal, simultaneously announcing and releasing a new project in one fell swoop? The latter worked incredibly well for online shooter Apex Legends, which remains one of the genre’s stalwarts six years after its surprise launch on 4 February 2019. What you don’t do with a new release, is something that falls awkwardly between those two approaches. Enter Highguard.\n\nThis new online multiplayer title from newcomer Wildlight Entertainment has an excellent pedigree. The studio was formed by ex-Respawn Entertainment staff, most of whom previously worked on Titanfall, Call of Duty and the aforementioned Apex Legends. They know what they’re doing. But the launch has been … troubled.\n\nThe game was revealed via a rather oblique trailer that closed last December’s lavish Game Awards event. Most viewers were expecting the ceremony to end with something huge – a major new announcement from Hideo Kojima, perhaps, or maybe a GTA 6 song and dance number. What they got was a short look at a fantasy-themed online shooter that no one had heard of – and it didn’t go down well.\n\nIt turns out that Wildlight hadn’t planned to reveal the game before its 26 January launch – they were going to pull another Apex Legends shadow drop – but Game Awards organiser Geoff Keighley played the game, liked it and offered them a free slot at his show. The team couldn’t turn it down. Although perhaps, with hindsight, they should have.\n\nNow it’s out in the open and it’s actually pretty interesting. Combining elements of an online shooter and a Moba (multiplayer online battle arena game), players get into two teams of three, select from a group of differently skilled hero characters and then try to destroy the other side’s base before their own is destroyed. The action comes in phases – first you fortify your castle, then you explore the landscape for loot and power-ups, then the fighting begins. Each part sort of feels like a different game and as I played the first few rounds, I was constantly thinking “ooh, that’s a bit like Rainbow Six Siege” and “ooh, this bit’s like Fortnite”. But the game does have an identity of its own, thanks to its fantasy/mythological styling – you get to ride a sort of spirit horse around the landscape, while different heroes throw lightning bolts or erect walls of ice.\n\nHowever, they also carry shotguns and assault rifles, so that it feels like a weird cross between Call of Duty and a Ray Harryhausen movie. What Respawn has always done well is design incredibly smooth kinetic playspaces, where traversal is rarely impeded. This is a trait that Wildlight Entertainment has inherited – in Highguard you can run, slide, climb and leap in seamless movements, rarely getting stuck on the scenery.\n\nBut sadly, the game’s disproportionately opulent reveal at the Game Awards has caused some issues. Almost immediately after launch, negative reviews started streaming on to the game’s Steam page, with players complaining about visual performance issues and long queues to get a match – which doesn’t feel that fair for a game that had only been online for a couple of hours. You have to wonder how destructive that unexpected Game Awards teaser was – the gamer community can be incredibly judgmental and they have long, bitter memories.\n\nHighguard did attract around 100k players on day one, not a bad start for a newcomer to the crowded online multiplayer space, but there’s a lot of work to do. The last couple of years has been a battlefield for online blasters, the scarred landscape strewn with the skeletons of failed competitors from Concord to Hyenas and Battleborn. On top of this, Valve, the company behind Steam, has its own Moba-inspired online team game, Deadlock, in development and reaction to the closed beta tests has been positive. Valve is not a rival anyone really wants to go up against.\n\nAnd there’s a reason everyone wants to be in this space – Fortnite is making around $5bn a year, and Battlefield 6 was one of the bestselling games of 2025. But considering the risks (hundreds of millions of dollars in development and marketing costs) and the volatile, unpredictable market, I can’t help but feel worried for the Highguard team. They’re banking on players staying around for months, building a community of adoring fans, maintaining huge concurrent player numbers. But it’s going to take a lot to get over the hurdle of that botched reveal.\n\nBesides, I have a feeling the next mega hit online shooter won’t be a Frankenstein’s monster of a game, sewn together from the recognisable body parts of previous hits. It’ll be something wild and fresh and new – a Godzilla, emerging from the depths of the game-development ocean, unexpected and bizarre and covered in seaweed. And whatever it is, it won’t get the end slot at the Game Awards, we’ll never see it coming.\n\n“Is this another one of your masochist games?” asked my partner, somewhat warily, watching me play mountain-climbing game Cairn this week. (He is well aware of my affection for extremely difficult video games; he’s witnessed me struggle through so many of them.) Cairn is a game about extreme mountaineering, in which you must move storied climber Aava’s individual limbs to find hand and footholds in the forbidding cliff faces of Kami, a mountain that has never been summited. Aava is obstinately determined to be the first person to get to the top, and as the game progresses, I began to question that obsession (and my own obsession with playing it). It is thoughtful, beautiful, and not always easy, and has provoked a lot of reflection. Look out for the full review on the Guardian tomorrow, in which I will be able to say much more. Keza MacDonald\n\nAvailable on: PS5, PC, Xbox\nEstimated playtime: 10-15 hours (for one epic climb)\n\nWe could use some positive games industry news, so how about this: according to GamesIndustry.biz, the unique newsletter-based indie games publisher Pantaloon has secured £150k to invest into new titles. Pantaloon offers its premium subscribers access to a range of new titles for £3.99 a month. Co-founder Jamin Smith stated, “We’re trying to invite risk back into the equation, find weirder, more wonderful, more creatively refreshing work that we can put our names to.”\n\nAs one of the few people who actually played on the Virtual Boy when it arrived in 1995, I was surprised to see that Nintendo is bringing the headache-inducing retro system to the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, complete with replica accessory and downloadable games. Now it’s been revealed that the lineup of digital titles will include an unreleased sequel to classic racer F-Zero named Zero Racers. You’ll need a subscription to the Nintendo Switch Online service to play it, but this is a fascinating and rare chance to play a Nintendo game that never made it to the shelves. Also coming is platforming adventure, D-Hopper which was cancelled due to the demise of the Virtual Boy. Just make sure to have painkillers to hand.\n\nThe pleasure of watching seasons pass in Animal Crossing is the theme of this lovely piece by journalist and author Jay Castello. Although you could feasibly skip the game’s fallow winter periods, having patience and embracing the darkness is part of the game’s slow charm.\n\n‘I didn’t have anything to prove’: what Traitors finalist Jade Scott learned about survival from video games\n\nPikachu and pals go wild: Pokémon theme park opens in Tokyo\n\nWhy I’m launching a feminist video games website in 2026\n\n‘It’s the underground Met Gala of concrete murderzone design’: welcome to the Quake Brutalist Game Jam\n\nReturn to Silent Hill – video game horror series births another middling movie | ★★☆☆☆\n\nKeza answers this week’s question from reader Caitlin:\n\n“I am endlessly thinking about games that take gamer expectations and use them in some way to enhance or subvert the experience – like Tunic, which plays with nostalgia for game manuals and secrets from the SNES days, or Inscryption, or Alan Wake 2. In each case there’s a way you think the game should go, and then the designers use your own gaming literacy to challenge those expectations. Can you say more about this small wave of games?”\n\nThis is also a favourite mini-genre of mine, as someone who for both professional and personal reasons has played really a lot of video games. One of the first games like this I ever played was Shadow of the Colossus. Go kill the big monster, the game tells you, as hundreds of games had before. Then you find the first colossus, and it’s just peacefully wandering around. You climb it and slay it, and there’s no fanfare for you. The creature crumples and dies. I felt a little bit sick. Spec Ops: The Line was also famous for doing this: telling the player to kill, then inviting them to feel awful about it. But as you point out, there are plenty more ways to subvert player expectations now. Frog Fractions is a classic; if you know nothing about this game, that’s perfect, just play it. The Stanley Parable was a great comedy-ish entry in this tradition, as is Undertale. And then there’s the recent run of games – Indika, Baby Steps – that mock you and your “gamer brain”. Never forget that Zelda: Breath of the Wild awards you with a poop-shaped trophy if you go to the immense trouble of finding every single Korok seed in the game.

    "fullText": "We need an honest reckoning with other factors that threaten young people’s wellbeing, from poverty to academic stress\n\nOur children’s feelings are not for sale, and nor are they to be manipulated.\n\nSo said Emmanuel Macron this week, after French lawmakers voted to ban under-15s from social media. Admittedly, he then repeated these sentiments in a post on X, in the time-honoured manner of parents solemnly lecturing children to do as we say, not as we do.\n\nYet Macron is not wrong. The backlash building up against social media now is unmistakable, as guilt over all those hours wasted scrolling meets growing alarm at the ugly and dystopian world big tech has helped create. Only last week the Labour MP Jess Asato, a government adviser on violence against women, described how an X user had created an AI-generated video of her being chloroformed and prepared for rape. Who wants their 14-year-old daughter hanging out somewhere that happens? Though teens mostly prefer TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat to X, it’s the grim excesses of the platform under Elon Musk that have shaken many adults out of complacency.\n\nParents are beguiled by tales of Australian kids rediscovering bike rides and board games, after under-16s were banned from social media just in time for the antipodean summer. Teachers sick of dealing with the fallout from adolescent social media beef, or the inevitable after-effects of kids staying up all night on their phones, want action. The surest sign of which way Labour winds are blowing, meanwhile, is that the health secretary, Wes Streeting, recently invited the pro-ban campaigning author Jonathan Haidt in to address officials, while the thwarted leadership hopeful Andy Burnham suggests a crackdown makes sense to him. Yet Downing Street has hesitated, leaving Kemi Badenoch to take advantage, for once, of an open goal. The Conservatives have amended the children’s wellbeing and schools bill going through the House of Lords in order to put the idea of a ban on the table, and will use an opposition day debate this Wednesday to hammer their point home, somewhat awkwardly for Labour MPs who broadly agree with the idea but don’t want to see the Tories take the credit.\n\nPersonally, I wasn’t convinced for a long time of the case for a ban. What changed my mind was realising how gen Z, now old enough to reflect on growing up in a social media free-for-all, feels about it. Half of 16- to 24-year-olds wish they’d spent less time on their phones and three-quarters want tougher regulation to protect young people from social media, according to recent polling for the thinktank The New Britain Project. When teenagers themselves say that they’d keep their own future children away from it for as long as possible, alarm bells should be ringing. And, though some will of course find enterprising ways around a ban, in itself that’s not an excuse for doing nothing; there’s a booming trade in fake ID for underage drinkers, but we don’t just give up and let 14-year-olds drink until they black out. Legislating on teenage harms is less about prohibition than setting social norms until they’re old enough to regulate their own intake, and protecting them from industries otherwise only too ready to exploit them.\n\nThat said, the ongoing government consultation on teens and social media should be given the time and space to consider more serious objections. Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly tragically killed herself after viewing endless images of self-harm on Instagram, has made a thoughtful case that the Online Safety Act (designed to outlaw the most egregious material) should be given a chance to work. Children’s charities, including the NSPCC, are worried about teenagers banned from the big platforms experimenting with riskier alternatives, and about the cliff-edge potentially created for kids let loose at 16 on social media with little experience of it. (Though the more countries follow Australia’s example, the greater the incentive for platforms to do what the former Meta executive Nick Clegg advocated when I interviewed him, and create teen versions of their product. Companies tend to innovate remarkably quickly when facing an existential threat to the business model.)\n\nThe most powerful argument against a ban, however, is that it’s not the easy answer to a teenage mental health crisis some want it to be. The evidence is still so mixed that it’s unclear whether being glued to a phone makes children miserable, or whether miserable teens spend more time online seeking comfort. New research from the University of Manchester, tracking 25,000 children, finds no evidence linking heavier social media use or gaming in one school year with increased anxiety and depression the next.\n\nYet the researchers didn’t conclude that social media was harmless: more that teenagers are complicated, and that adults should pay more attention to what they’re doing both on and offline. Age limits for social media could fit alongside properly funded children’s mental health services, more things for teenagers to do away from a screen – the recent government announcement of funding for youth clubs was a start – an honest reckoning with what else threatens children’s wellbeing, from poverty to academic stress, and some uncomfortable questions about parenting. If a four-year-old is already so online that they try to swipe a book rather than read it, as a survey of reception teachers for the charity Kindred Squared recently reported, that’s not big tech’s fault.\n\nA ban is not, then, a panacea. But it ought to be part of a broader national mission for happier childhoods, which recognises that as a society we have for some time been asleep at the wheel. It’s not too late, even now, to wake up.\n\nGaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

    "fullText": "World’s richest person targeting symbolic date in June for flotation of rocket company\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX is considering a flotation valuing the rocket company at $1.5tn (£1.1tn) that will reportedly be timed for early summer to coincide with a planetary alignment and the multibillionaire’s birthday.\n\nThe world’s richest person is targeting a symbolic date of mid-June for the initial public offering, according to the Financial Times. This would be around the same time as Jupiter and Venus appear in close proximity to each other and shortly before Musk turns 55 on 28 June.\n\nThe FT also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $50bn – valuing it at $1.5tn – compared with previous reports that it was looking for $25bn at an $800bn valuation. Last week, it was reported that the rocket company was considering Bank of America, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for leading roles in the share sale.\n\nMusk, whose $680bn fortune would be turbo-boosted by a SpaceX flotation, said last year the company’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa. The billionaire owns about 42% of SpaceX, as well as nearly 17% of the electric carmaker Tesla, where he is chief executive. He also owns more than three-quarters of the social media platform X.\n\nSpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink satellite high-speed internet service.\n\nIf the flotation goes ahead it would involve a bigger initial fundraising than the IPO of the oil company Saudi Aramco, which raised $29bn in 2019, although for a larger total valuation of $1.7tn.\n\nThe chief financial officer of SpaceX, Bret Johnsen, has held talks and video conference calls with existing private investors since December to explore a mid-2026 IPO, the FT added.\n\nMusk has reportedly been swayed by the idea of a SpaceX float because of its growing valuation and the success of Starlink.\n\nGlobal financial markets are anticipating a year of significant US listings, with the artificial intelligence companies Anthropic and OpenAI also laying early groundwork for potential IPOs.\n\nA rebound in the US equity capital market activity began in 2025 after three years of limited activity, partly as the result of volatility and geopolitical tensions. Space technology is a tightly held sector but is sought after by investors keen for exposure in light of rapid development prospects, analysts have said.\n\nNeil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said the mooted $1.5tn price tag was a “monster premium”.\n\nHe added: “A valuation that big reflects not just a tech and AI premium but Elon Musk’s stardust and a frothy market, plus a heck of a lot of media narrative around this. It is to some degree a kind of bet on the future space economy.”\n\nSpaceX has been approached for comment.",

    "fullText": "Beijing’s AI policy is focused on real-life applications but Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions\n\nStanding on stage in the eastern China tech hub of Hangzhou, Alibaba’s normally media-shy CEO made an attention-grabbing announcement. “The world today is witnessing the dawn of an AI-driven intelligent revolution,” Eddie Wu told a developer conference in September. “Artificial general intelligence (AGI) will not only amplify human intelligence but also unlock human potential, paving the way for the arrival of artificial superintelligence (ASI).”\n\nASI, Wu said, “could produce a generation of ‘super scientists’ and ‘full-stack super engineers’”, who would “tackle unsolved scientific and engineering problems at unimaginable speeds”.\n\nWu also announced plans to invest 380bn yuan (£40bn) in AI infrastructure over the next three years, news that sent Alibaba stocks soaring to their highest in nearly four years.\n\nWu’s foray into the existential, techno-frontier rhetoric normally deployed by western tech CEOs such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman and DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis caught the attention of observers. “Wu’s ASI speech represents a breakthrough,” the tech writer Afra Wang wrote in her China AI newsletter, Concurrent. “Major Chinese companies are beginning to articulate their own grand visions that carry the flavour of future prophecy.”\n\nAGI, a theoretical state of AI where a highly autonomous system is able to do a human’s job, has become the preoccupation of American tech companies such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Many see it as the next frontier of civilisation, and are in competition with each other, and China, to get there. In May, the president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, told a US Senate committee on AI that the “race between the United States and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover”.\n\nMany in Washington have internalised these fears. The US-China economic and scurity review commission has recommended that Congress “establish and fund a Manhattan Project-like program dedicated to racing to and acquiring an artificial general intelligence (AGI) capability”. The Manhattan Project was a second world war-era research operation to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nIn China, many saw Wu’s speech as articulating the vision of a bold, singular tech company, but not one that represented China’s overall AI industry.\n\n“China certainly has research groups working towards AGI. But most AI companies are working towards better applications,” said Ya-Qin Zhang, the dean of Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research and former president of the tech company Baidu.\n\nA combination of limited computing power, a pragmatic approach to technology and a keen awareness of the present day potential of AI has steered China’s national AI policy towards real-life applications rather than frontier research.\n\nIn August, the Chinese government published its highly anticipated “AI+ strategy”. The policy document outlined how AI could turbocharge China’s development goals, such as by using AI to improve medical diagnoses and make supply chains more efficient. But it made no mention of AGI.\n\n“The Chinese government is intently focused on reaping the benefits of AI in the here and now and in the near future through diffusion and application of AI across the economy, society, defence, and other areas,” said Julian Gewirtz, a former senior director for China and Taiwan at the White House national security council. “Despite its goal to ‘catch up and surpass’ the United States, we shouldn’t assume that the Chinese Communist party has bought into the idea that AGI is imminent.”\n\n“If you’re just looking at what has been officially published … there is no clear acknowledgment of AGI at all,” said Selina Xu, a China tech analyst. Xu noted that Xi Jinping, China’s leader, had a history of preferring the physical economy to more intangible forces.\n\n“It’s a very different narrative from the AGI race as a lot of people in DC see it,” Xu said.\n\nOne of the biggest factors guiding this strategy is the fact that US sanctions have prevented Chinese companies from acquiring the world’s most sophisticated semiconductors, which are needed for advanced AI research.\n\nWashington has banned the sale of hi-tech microchips to China in an effort to rein in the country’s AI development. Nvidia, the world’s leading chipmaker, then developed more basic semiconductors specifically for the Chinese market. In December, Washington approved the Nvidia’s second-most advanced chips, the H200s, for sale in China. But Beijing has reportedly told custom agents that the chips cannot be imported into China, as the government seeks to break the country’s reliance on overseas technology.\n\nChina insists that “necessity is the mother of invention” and points to the success of companies such as DeepSeek as proof that the US restrictions will merely spur innovation. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, is one of the few Chinese tech leaders who, like Alibaba’s Wu, has openly expressed an interest in AGI.\n\nBut until China is able to produce its own advanced semiconductors at scale, most tech companies feel it is more profitable to use the hardware they already have to focus on AI applications rather than AGI.\n\nAnother factor guiding the US-China tech competition is the availability of datacentres and the energy to power them. In November, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, said China would “win the AI race” in part because of its energy subsidies for datacentres.\n\nThe subsidies were reportedly introduced after Chinese tech companies complained of higher electricity bills caused by the domestic semiconductors they are obliged to use, which are less efficient than Nvidia’s. In a sign of how determined China is to break its reliance on imported technology, Reuters reported that any datacentres in receipt of state funds could only use domestic chips.\n\nSuch measures would reduce Nvidia’s competitive advantage in China and boost domestic chip producers, such as Huawei.\n\nSince 2021, China has reportedly poured $100bn into support for AI datacentres.\n\nBut there are signs that the boom may have been overzealous. A recent report from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology said that nationwide, the utilisation rate for AI datacentres was 32%.\n\nIn a recent op-ed in China Economic Weekly, Rao Shaoyang, the director at the China Telecom Research Institute, wrote that in some regions of China, the computing power industry was operating in a similar fashion to China’s beleaguered property sector: build first, find buyers later. He cautioned against “blindly building intelligent computing centres” and said local computing power demand should be considered before building new datacentres.\n\nDespite the surplus in more general computing power, many experts believe China still does not have chips that are sophisticated enough to explore frontier research in AGI. But analysts note that the mood could change quickly.\n\n“The current status quo is highly fluid, and Xi Jinping has explicitly declared an ambition to lead the world in AI,” said Gewirtz. “So the fact that China construes that goal one way at this snapshot moment in time does not give me any comfort that in a year they’re going to construe it the same way.”\n\nAdditional research by Lillian Yang",

    "fullText": "Founder of the world wide web says commercialisation means the net has been ‘optimised for nastiness’, but collaboration and compassion can prevail\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nWhen Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989, his vision was clear: it would used by everyone, filled with everything and, crucially, it would be free.\n\nToday, the British computer scientist’s creation is regularly used by 5.5 billion people – and bears little resemblance to the democratic force for humanity he intended.\n\nIn Australia to promote his book, This is for Everyone, Berners-Lee is reflecting on what his invention has become – and how he and a community of collaborators can put the power of the web back into the hands of its users.\n\nBerners-Lee describes his excitement in the earliest years of the web as “uncontainable”. Approaching 40 years on, a rebellion is brewing among himself and a community of like-minded activists and developers.\n\n“We can fix the internet … It’s not too late,” he writes, describing his mission as a “battle for the soul of the web”.\n\nBerners-Lee traces the first corruption of the web to the commercialisation of the domain name system, which he believes would have served web users better had it been managed by a nonprofit in the public interest. Instead, he says, in the 1990s the .com space was pounced on by “charlatans”.\n\n“The Americans were very keen about commercialising the internet … crossing the boundary from being an academic thing to being a commercial thing,” he tells Guardian Australia from Brisbane.\n\nThe pursuit of profit soon became a driving force in how the internet was designed. But it wasn’t until 2016 – the same year he won the Turing award – that the US elections showed Berners-Lee just how toxic the web could be. Two years later, he told Vanity Fair that he was “devastated” by the abuses of the web.\n\nFor 35 years, Berners-Lee has written what he considers to be the world’s first blog. One post, published in June 2024, is dominated by a crowded map of “everything on the internet”. It is a reminder of the web’s overall beneficence – from email and Zoom to health, podcasts, collaboration, creativity and digital sovereignty, the diagram shows the web is, for the most part, good.\n\nBut to the left of the diagram is a cluster of red, including X, Snapchat, YouTube, “feed manipulation for engagement”, addiction, polarisation, disinformation and mental illness. This corner of the web, its creator says, has been “optimised for nastiness”. It is extractive and surveillance-heavy.\n\n“It’s only a small part of the whole internet … but the problem is that people spend a lot of time on [social media websites] because they’re addictive,” he says.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nGiven it was always supposed to be human-like in its sprawling connectivity, perhaps its darker sides were inevitable.\n\n“Yes and no,” Berners-Lee says. “There used to be a sort of mantra that technology was neutral and people are good and bad. But actually, that’s not true of things on the web.\n\n“The way you design a website, like Reddit or Pinterest or Snapchat, can be explicitly good.” Or, designed with engagement as a priority, its algorithm can be explicitly bad.\n\nCompounding the problem is monopolisation. Facebook and Google’s dominance is bad for innovation and bad for the web, he says, because monopolies get in the way of building systems that are truly pro-human. How many companies, after all, hold your (identical) data in non-transparent and incompatible systems?\n\nSince Berners-Lee’s disappointment a decade ago, he’s thrown everything at a project that completely shifts the way data is held on the web, known as the Solid (social linked data) protocol. It’s activism that is rooted in people power – not unlike the first years of the web.\n\nThis version of the internet would turbocharge personal sovereignty and give control back to users.\n\n“When people are excited, they get a twinkle in their eye and they start coding just because of what they can imagine,” he says of developers who “get” the concept.\n\nHe likens Solid “pods” to backpacks of data that are securely held by each individual, allowing them to choose what to share with certain people, businesses and organisations. Department of Education data could be shared with an AI tutor; medical data with a cousin, doctor and nutritionist. The Flanders government in Belgium treats data as a national utility and is already using Solid pods for its citizens.\n\nThe Facebooks and Xs of the world need not join in – the new systems will be so empowering, collaborative and compassionate, he believes, that parts of today’s web will become obsolescent.\n\n“The existing systems will fade to a certain extent, because people will get more excited in new systems,” he says.\n\n“Being able to collaborate across the world with friends and family and colleagues will be something that they end up getting addicted to – a much better form of addiction.”\n\nHe’s not the only person wanting to fix these problems. Australia’s world-first social media ban – which blocks under-16s from using a host of sites including Snapchat, X, Facebook and YouTube – is one attempt at a solution. Although Berners-Lee is not convinced.\n\n“I’m interested to see how it goes down in Australia, because there are people in the UK who are proposing it in a similar way, and others may follow on,” he says.\n\n“The first question is whether kids should be using those particular social media sites. I think you have to recognise that things like messaging services are useful.”\n\nInstead, he’s in favour of smartphones that are especially designed for children, blocking access to harmful sites. He points to the Other phone, designed in collaboration with Mumsnet users, as an alternative to devices that allow unfettered access to social media.\n\nIt’s on the subject of artificial intelligence that his optimism plummets.\n\nBerners-Lee has long seen AI – which exists only because of the web and its data – as having the potential to transform society far beyond the boundaries of self-interested companies. But now is the time, he says, to put guardrails in place so that AI remains a force for good – and he’s afraid the chance may pass humankind by.\n\n“The horse is bolting,” he says of reining in AI’s unchecked development and growing intelligence.\n\nBerners-Lee created the web, HTML and HTTP at Cern, the home of the Large Hadron Collider, on the outskirts of Geneva. Cern’s scientific, non-commercial approach was key to the way the technology was shared.\n\n“I would like to see a Cern for AI, where all the top scientists come together and see whether they can make a super intelligence. And, if they can, they contain it into a system where it can’t just go out and persuade people to let it run the world.”\n\nRight now, though, given the division sown in part by that red corner of the web, we are “very, very far from a Cern for AI”, he says.\n\n“We have got AI being done in these huge companies, but also in these huge silos. They’re not looking over each other’s shoulder. They’re just sitting there, inside their own company, looking at their own system, trying to make it smarter.\n\n“I don’t see a way that we can get to a point where the scientific community gets to look at the AI and to decide whether it is safe or not.”\n\nSir Tim Berners-Lee will be speaking at the Brisbane Powerhouse on Thursday 29 January and the Sydney Opera House on Friday 30 January",

    "fullText": "AlphaGenome can analyse up to 1m letters of DNA code at once and could pave way for new treatments\n\nResearchers at Google DeepMind have unveiled their latest artificial intelligence tool and claimed it will help scientists identify the genetic drivers of disease and ultimately pave the way for new treatments.\n\nAlphaGenome predicts how mutations interfere with the way genes are controlled, changing when they are switched on, in which cells of the body, and whether their biological volume controls are set to high or low.\n\nMost common diseases that run in families, including heart disease and autoimmune disorders, as well as mental health problems, have been linked to mutations that affect gene regulation, as have many cancers, but identifying which genetic glitches are to blame is far from straightforward.\n\n“We see AlphaGenome as a tool for understanding what the functional elements in the genome do, which we hope will accelerate our fundamental understanding of the code of life,” Natasha Latysheva, a DeepMind researcher, told a press briefing on the work.\n\nThe human genome runs to 3bn pairs of letters – the Gs, Ts, Cs and As that comprise the DNA code. About 2% of the genome tells cells how to make proteins, the building blocks of life. The rest orchestrates gene activity, carrying the crucial instructions that dictate where, when and how much individual genes are switched on.\n\nThe researchers trained AlphaGenome on public databases of human and mouse genetics, enabling it to learn connections between mutations in specific tissues and their impact on gene regulation. The AI can analyse up to 1m letters of DNA code at once and predict how mutations will affect different biological processes.\n\nThe DeepMind team believes the tool will help scientists map out which strands of genetic code are most essential for the development of particular tissues, such as nerve and liver cells, and pinpoint the most important mutations for driving cancer and other diseases. It could also underpin new gene therapies by allowing researchers to design entirely new DNA sequences – for example, to switch on a certain gene in nerve cells but not in muscle cells.\n\nCarl de Boer, a researcher at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved in the work, said: “AlphaGenome can identify whether mutations affect genome regulation, which genes are impacted and how, and in what cell types. A drug could then be developed to counteract this effect.\n\n“Ultimately, our goal is to have models that are so good we don’t have to do an experiment to confirm their predictions. While AlphaGenome represents a significant innovation, achieving this goal will require continued work from the scientific community.”\n\nSome scientists have already begun using AlphaGenome. Marc Mansour, a clinical professor of paediatric haemato-oncology at UCL, said it marked a “step change” in his work to find genetic drivers for cancer.\n\nGareth Hawkes, a statistical geneticist at the University of Exeter, said: “The non-coding genome is 98% of our 3bn base pair genome. We understand the 2% fairly well, but the fact that we’ve got AlphaGenome that can make predictions of what this other 2.94bn base pair region is doing is a big step forward for us.”",

    "fullText": "Ramsey prioritizes employer-matched 401(k) contributions first, then Roth 401(k), then traditional 401(k).\n\nEmployer 401(k) matches function as free money that accelerates retirement savings when fully captured.\n\nRoth 401(k) provides tax advantages and flexibility superior to traditional 401(k) when no match exists.\n\nInvestors rethink ‘hands off’ investing and decide to start making real money\n\nIf you're working at a company that has a generous 401(k) match option, you should probably take it as you would \"extra gravy\" on your biscuit, as long as it fits within your personal budget. In a recent episode of The Dave Ramsey Show, famed personal finance guru Dave Ramsey recently referred to company contributions to a 401(k) as \"gravy on the biscuit,\" an analogy I agree wholeheartedly with.\n\nIndeed, I've heard employer matches being referred to as \"free money.\" And in many ways, it is, provided you can put up a sum of your own to stash away in your 401(k). Many savers have the option of adjusting the percentage they contribute. Oftentimes, it makes the most sense to put up the maximum amount that your employer will match. After all, you want to get the most \"gravy\" or \"free money\" you possibly can, even if it means having to save up a bit more of your own cash for your retirement.\n\nUnderstandably, it can be challenging to pay yourself first, but with generous employee matches, there is an incentive to kick your 401(k) retirement portfolio into overdrive.\n\nA caller named Joel had the opportunity to ask famed personal finance guru Dave Ramsey an intriguing question on his show relating to retirement contributions. He's currently contributing 15% of his paycheck — that's Dave Ramsey's Baby Step #4 — to a traditional 401(k), which is on the high end of his firm's 10-15% profit-sharing contribution.\n\nJoel asked Ramsey if he should change the contribution amount and whether he should consider the Roth 401(k). Indeed, these questions are likely on the minds of many listeners who also work at a firm with generous retirement contribution plans.\n\nDave Ramsey noted that Joel is on the right track by contributing the maximum amount of 15%, even if the company didn't match the amount in full.\n\nThat said, any employer matches were \"gravy\" to help fast-track one to a more comfortable retirement. Of course, things are always made much better with a bit of fresh gravy poured on top. But even without it, a biscuit can be a delicious treat on its own.",

    "fullText": "The post A 700-Pound Grizzly Sat Inches From This Photographer. His 3-Word Response Saved Him appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nSurviving a close encounter with a 700-pound grizzly requires maintaining absolute stillness within its critical space.\n\nThe crushing power of a grizzly’s jaw creates a lethal risk during close-range observations.\n\nLightning strikes pose a statistically similar threat to humans as grizzly bear encounters.\n\nExecuting a 3-word vocal command was necessary to redirect the apex predator as it approached the photographer.\n\nCan you imagine spotting a grizzly when you’re out enjoying nature? It would be heart-racing enough to spot one from a distance, but imagine one that casually walks up to your camp chairs, literally feet from you?\n\nWell, that’s exactly what happened to one photographer with ice in his veins – an enormous grizzly casually stopped by and sat down next to him. His camera didn’t even shake!\n\nThis is a short clip, but one that starts with a jaw-dropping, eerily peaceful but tense moment. In the background, you can see some snow-covered mountains with a large, open green space just ahead of a, wait for it—huge grizzly bear.\n\nAlmost comically, there is a lawn chair on the right side of the screen, as if the bear had been invited for a daytime hangout. Seemingly unbothered by the man’s presence off to his right, the bear looks around and casually walks forward toward the rushing river just below.\n\nHe stops to take in the sight, the way a tourist would. At this point, he is a mere couple of feet from the man’s lawn chair and the man. Its size can be fully appreciated at this angle—and so can its mighty claws.\n\nThe grizzly’s slow yawn and heavy breathing may look like human sadness or boredom, but in wild bears, these can be signals of the animal processing its surroundings or simply cooling down after the physical exertion of fishing.\n\nAttributing human emotion to a bear should be left for cartoons, but the scene is much too rare, and begin to feel as though they both need this time away with a friend out by the cleansing aura of rushing waters.\n\nThe cameraman holds the camera steady, and the grizzly continues looking out onto the water, not acknowledging the presence of the man or the little site he’s created for himself. White birds fly in the background as the bear decides this is a nice place to rest.\n\nThe bear sits back and places its front paws just ahead of its torso, resting on the ground. Suddenly, he stands up and starts walking toward the man. The man responds quickly, turning the camera and saying “Hey, hey, hey” to the bear.\n\nThe bear, disinterested, walks around the man and away from him. At the end of the short clip, the camera captures another camera pointed out toward the water, where somewhere around 10 grizzly bears can be spotted. This cameraman probably wasn’t counting on such a close encounter, but his nerves of steel paid off as he earned some truly epic close-up footage of this enormous bear.\n\nA grizzly encounter would be a major challenge for the average person. This encounter took place at the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary, where bears have become ‘habitually indifferent’ to people. Because the bears and humans follow strict rules of coexistence, the bear felt comfortable enough to rest near the photographer without perceiving him as a threat or a source of food.\n\nGrizzly bears weigh upward of 700 pounds — the males being much heavier than the females. A large female can weigh up to 350 pounds. While grizzlies are significantly larger and heavier than black bears, they are typically smaller than polar bears and the massive kodiak bears found on the islands of southwestern Alaska. With a bite force of over 1,100 PSI, a grizzly has enough power to crush heavy bone and thick materials — a strength often compared to the force needed to crack a bowling ball.\n\nThey can be distinguished from black bears by a concave-looking face and a shoulder hump full of muscles that attach to the Grizzly’s backbone for extra strength for digging. Their very long, sharp claws on the front feet also give them extra ability to dig for food and to dig out their dens. Do not rely on color for identification. Black bears can actually be brown, cinnamon, or even blonde. Instead, look for the grizzly’s prominent shoulder hump and concave facial profile, which Black bears lack.\n\nFortunately, the bears don’t consider humans to be prey. Visitors to national parks known for bears, such as Yellowstone, are about as likely to be killed by a lightning strike as a bear attack. Grizzly bears are curious, with good eyesight and excellent memories, hearing, and sense of smell. They are also intelligent and reclusive; they will alter their habits to avoid humans and much like any animal, they have what is called a “critical space”, an area surrounding them that they will defend. These bears are more likely to be indifferent to human presence, although every bear encounter will be different.\n\nIt is important to remain calm during any encounter with a wild animal and if you are traveling in an area with bears, you should prepare yourself on how to proceed.\n\nUnless you live in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Washington, or Wyoming – you don’t have to worry about grizzlies. They were once more widespread but have been hunted almost to extinction in some areas and still suffer from habitat loss. There are about 21,000 grizzlies in Canada. Life expectancy is 20-25 years.\n\nThe post A 700-Pound Grizzly Sat Inches From This Photographer. His 3-Word Response Saved Him appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Firefox User Should Know",
    "description": "Enhance your privacy, security, and overall browsing experience.",
    "fullText": "I've been using Firefox as my default browser for over two decades now, and during this time, I've learned a thing or two about making the most of its many features. There are some features that are turned on by default that I would recommend turning off, and some simple tweaks you can make that will greatly enhance your privacy and security. Here are all the Firefox hacks I use to make my browsing experience better, so you can try them yourself.\n\nFirefox pushes the Firefox Home screen as the default whenever you open a new tab. There's nothing particularly wrong about that, but it does come with some unnecessary sponsored content, which you can get rid of. To do this, go to the Firefox settings, by clicking the three-lines icon in the top-right corner of an open Firefox window window and selecting Settings. Now, click the Home tab in the left pane and scroll to Firefox Home Content. Disable Support Firefox to remove sponsored content, and toss in remove Shortcuts if you prefer a cleaner look over quick links to commonly visited sites. My home screen just has Web Search enabled, which looks good with a nice wallpaper.\n\nIf your Firefox is being slow or unresponsive, you can use the built-in task manager to identify which tabs or extensions are causing a slowdown. This feature is also great for periodically monitoring the browser's performance. You can access it by clicking the three-lines icon in the top-right and navigating to More tools > Task Manager. Alternatively, you can open Firefox and press Shift-Esc, or type about:processes in the address bar.\n\nOnce the task manager is open, you can use it just as you'd use the task manager on your PC or Mac. It lets you quickly close unresponsive tabs, disable all extensions in one go, and monitor RAM and CPU usage, too.\n\nYou can open any webpage in Firefox and use the built-in screenshot tool to take a quick picture of the webpage you're on. This is the fastest way to take a full-page screenshot without throwing in the rest of your screen, or to capture just a small section of a webpage. Just right-click anywhere on a webpage and select Take Screenshot. You'll see both options (capture a selected part of the page, or the full page), and you can pick one to take a quick screenshot.\n\nLike every other app in the world, Firefox has added AI features I never asked for to the browser. One of these appears in the context menu, so you can easily remove it from there. Right-click any webpage, and in the Ask AI Chatbot section, select Remove AI Chatbot to get rid of this feature. You can also go to Firefox settings > General > Tabs and disable Use AI to suggest tabs and a name for tab groups.\n\nUnfortunately, Firefox collects a lot of data about your browsing habits by default, and I highly recommend disabling this to enhance your privacy. Go to Firefox settings > Privacy & Security > Firefox Data Collection, and disable every option under this section.\n\nWhile you're at it, let's keep people who aren't Firefox from seeing your browsing data, too. Firefox can automatically switch to a more secure HTTPS page if you accidentally open an unencrypted HTTP link (these are mostly being phased out, but you might stumble upon them every once in a while). Under Firefox settings > Privacy & Security > HTTPS-Only Mode, just toggle on Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows. The browser will handle the rest.\n\nYou can also encrypt your web traffic further by enabling DNS over HTTPS, which is below the option I just mentioned. On the same page, in the section titled Enable DNS over HTTPS using:, scroll down a bit and choose Increased Protection or Max Protection (Max Protection is a bit stricter, but can break some websites, so I only recommend it for power users). The default DNS provider is Cloudflare, but you can also use NextDNS or a custom DNS if you wish. This feature makes it harder for third-parties to see which sites you're visiting.\n\nFor even more privacy, try out advanced about:config tweaks.\n\nWhenever I visit a website these days, it feels like I'm being bombarded with permissions pop-ups asking me if they can send me notifications, use my location, and who knows what else. Firefox lets you easily disable most of these. Go to Firefox settings > Privacy & Security > Permissions. Click Location and select Block new requests to access your location. While you're there, you can click through the available options and turn on other blocks, too. You can use these to block notification requests and autoplaying videos. Some sites may still use special tricks to bypass autoplay blocks, but it doesn't hurt to make them work for it.\n\nA Firefox installation just isn't complete without a few good browser extensions. I keep seeing fun new extensions I want to install, but having too many of these can slow your browser down. So, it's best to install a few good ones and remove any redundant extensions. To know where to start, check out my list of the best Firefox extensions.\n\nThere are many pros and a few cons to using an adblocker, but it's a recommended tool these days, both to protect your privacy and to stay safe from scams. A good ad blocker will remove unwanted junk from webpages, block trackers, and speed up browsing. I've been using uBlock Origin for a decade now, and it's still the one I recommend most to everyone who asks. Once the extension is installed, you should tweak a few advanced uBlock Origin settings to make the most of it.\n\nThis is a bit of a controversial take, but it works for me, so here it goes: Vertical tabs are better than horizontal ones. I really like my browser window to occupy as much space as possible, and using horizontal tabs goes against that idea. Once I made the switch to vertical tabs, my browser's window just started looking a lot cleaner. On my Mac, I still use horizontal tabs, but that's because I keep the dock on the left side of the screen. On my Windows PC, however, vertical tabs just look so much nicer. If you want to try making the switch, go to Firefox settings > General > Browser Layout. Pick Vertical Tabs and enjoy.\n\nNo, this is not a time travel tip. Firefox Labs is where the browser releases experimental new features before making them public (or canning them). If you're fine with being a guinea pig, Firefox Labs is your chance to try these experimental features without downloading the browser's full beta release. You can enable these features by going to Firefox settings > Firefox Labs.",

    "description": "Health insurance stocks fell hard Tuesday morning as investors digested a CMS report proposing a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.",
    "fullText": "The health insurance sector saw a deep sell-off Tuesday, led by a plunge in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) shares, as the Trump administration proposed a lower-than-expected increase to 2027 Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nIn a report published Monday night by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the administration proposed that payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans (private insurance plans) will rise by just 0.09% in 2027. Analysts were expecting an increase of as much as 6%.\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) lost nearly 20%, while fellow major insurers Elevance Health (ELV) and CVS (CVS) each shed around 14%.\n\nThe smaller-than-expected proposal comes as margins are already tight for insurers. When UNH reported earnings Tuesday morning, the company said its Medical Care Ratio sat at 89.1%. Other insurers have reported similar rates.\n\nThe MCR is a key metric that measures the percentage of premium revenue spent on medical claims and healthcare services for policy members. In UNH's case, the company uses $0.89 of every dollar the company makes from the premiums it charges customers to pay for medical care.\n\nUnitedHealth has the largest exposure among insurers to Medicare Advantage changes, accounting for roughly 30% of enrollment nationally. Humana (HUM), which comes in second with roughly 17% of national enrollment, also saw shares plunge over 20% on Tuesday.\n\nThe tiny increase for 2027 comes after the insurance got a 5.06% increase for 2026, higher than expected. Final numbers for 2027 are scheduled to be finalized on or before April 6, according to William Blair analysts.\n\nIn a statement released after the CMS report, a spokesperson for the insurance industry group AHIP said that, if the proposal is to be implemented, it \"could result in benefit cuts and higher costs for 35 million seniors and people with disabilities when they renew their Medicare Advantage coverage in October 2026.\"\n\nThe proposal \"represents an additional headwind for the [Medicare Advantage] sector, further pressuring industry fundamentals,\" William Blair analysts wrote in a note to clients published on Tuesday.\n\nUnitedHealth, the country's largest insurer, took a secondary hit Tuesday morning when the company reported fourth quarter and full-year 2025 revenues that came in below expectations.\n\nFourth quarter and full-year revenue came in at $113.2 billion and $447.6 billion, respectively, compared to estimates of $113.7 billion and $447.9 billion. Both fourth quarter and full-year revenues were up 12% against the previous year.",

    "title": "Nine Essential Products for Digging Your Car Out of the Snow",
    "description": "You can free your car from its icy prison.",
    "fullText": "Those of us who only have on-street parking know the frustration of waking up on a snowy morning to find our vehicle completely buried in snow—a situation often made worse by passing snowplows that block it in even more. Digging your car out can be a challenge, but taking a few precautions and having the right tools ready can make it easier. Here’s everything you need to dig your car out when it is buried by snow.\n\nDigging your car out from the snow actually begins before the storm hits. Prepping the car ahead of time will make it a lot easier to extract from snow drifts. Here's what you need:\n\nBattery blankets. Your battery won’t be exposed to the snow, but it will be exposed to temperature extremes. Car batteries start to lose capacity when the temperatures reach freezing, and things just get worse from there—so if it’s cold enough to snow, it’s cold enough to stress your battery. A battery blanket can help by insulating your battery and keeping it warm enough to start your car, which is an essential part of getting it out of a snow-packed spot.\n\nCar covers. If you know snow is coming, you can save yourself some trouble by covering your car in some way. Even throwing a standard blue tarp and securing it with some twine or elastic straps can make it a lot easier to de-snow your car (you could also buy one of these enormous plastic bags, instead of a tarp). Other options include windshield covers that will make snow removal easier while also protecting your side-view mirrors.\n\nGrille covers. Ice and snow can get into your car’s ventilation system via the front grille, so buying a grille cover for your specific car make and model isn’t a bad addition to your snow prep.\n\nAfter the universe has dumped several feet of snow on your car and the local snowplows have made the situation worse, you’ll need some tools to free the vehicle. A shovel, of course, is going to be necessary at a minimum, but a few more gadgets will make the job a lot easier and quicker:\n\nA remote starter. If your car doesn’t have a remote start feature, consider adding an aftermarket product. This will allow you to start the car before you even head out into the snow, ensuring that it’s warmed up and melting snow and ice off of itself before you even lift a shovel.\n\nA Snow Joe. The Snow Joe is a terrific tool—it’s a scraper and a finish-safe broom in one, with optional lights if you bother to pop batteries into it. If you don’t cover your car, or if your cover slipped and you still have snow to clear, the Snow Joe will make it easy.\n\nA cordless blower. Using your muscles to clear snow off your car is one way to do it. Another is to invest in a cordless blower, or, in a pinch, to drag your leaf blower out there to just blow the snow off. Whatever you do, don’t use a hair dryer or a heat gun—watching the snow melt off your car might be satisfying, but you can crack your windshield and harm your car’s finish by using heat in cold weather like that.\n\nDe-icer. If the ice that has formed a shell on your car is thick and difficult to scrape, having some de-icer to safely melt it off will be a godsend. You can buy some to keep in the trunk, or make your own by mixing up two-thirds isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) and one-third water. Adding a dash of dish soap will make it easier to spread so it sits on the ice to work instead of just draining off.\n\nTraction mats. Digging your car out is often just step one of getting it out of an iced-up spot. Some traction mats in the trunk will ensure you have enough friction to get off the ice sheet that has formed under your vehicle.\n\nTow straps. Finally, if you’ve been out there for two hours and your car remains immobile despite your best efforts, you might ask someone to give you a quick tow, and for that you’ll need some tow straps. Having these in the trunk might just save the day when all the gadgets and products in the world can’t get that car out of the snow.",

    "title": "I Use Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy Phones Every Day, and Here’s How They Differ",
    "description": "Can't decide between Google and Samsung? Here's what you need to know.",
    "fullText": "If you're going to go with Android rather than an iPhone for your smartphone, then Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy handsets are the two most high-profile options you've got. There are other Android phones worth considering—from the likes of OnePlus and Nothing, for example—but Google and Samsung are the most well-known.\n\nWhile the fundamental operating system on Pixel and Galaxy phones is the same, there are numerous differences between these two flavors of Android. They're not all obvious, though, unless you spend every day with these handsets, and that can make it tricky to decide whether you're better off going with Google or Samsung.\n\nAs it happens, I use Pixel and Galaxy phones every day, more or less—not because tech journalists are particularly wealthy, but because we have to write a lot of reviews, news stories, and how-to guides for our jobs. Here's what I've learned along the way, and how you can choose between Pixel phones and Galaxy phones.\n\nIn the old days we used to talk about \"stock\" Android on Google's Nexus or Pixel phones, but that doesn't really exist any more: Even Google puts its own twists and tweaks on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) that every Android manufacturer has access to. Samsung adds even more on top of the AOSP foundation, and markets its own take on Android as One UI.\n\nThere's no doubt that One UI on Galaxy phones is busier and more complex than Android on Pixel phones—which can either be a positive or a negative, depending on how you like your mobile software. Samsung offers more settings, customizations, and configurations than Google, so One UI is going to appeal to power users.\n\nGalaxy phones offer \n\nGoogle takes a simpler approach to the user interface—which you could praise as uncluttered or criticize as basic, depending on your perspective and taste. The Pixel version of Android has gotten a bit more polished over time, and has borrowed a few tricks from Samsung, but it's still not as customizable overall.\n\nWith Pixel phones, Google's apps are front and center. On a Galaxy phone, you get all of Google's key apps, and all of Samsung's equivalents, installed by default: So again, Galaxy phones are the more cluttered of the two. There's nothing wrong with Samsung's apps for photos, calendars, contacts, web browsing, and so on, but it's likely that most of the time you're going to prefer the Google option.\n\nThat might change depending on what else you own: If you have a Galaxy Watch strapped to your wrist, then Samsung Health becomes far more useful and interesting. If you've gone for a Pixel Watch, then you're going to prefer the Google-owned Fitbit. As with most tech purchases these days, from TVs to smart speakers to laptops, you'll need to consider what else you own from Google or Samsung.\n\nGoogle does keep some features as exclusives for Pixel phones, though they often trickle out to the wider Android ecosystem over time. At the moment, they include Call Screen (for putting a barrier between you and spam calls), the real-time Scam Detection feature, Pixel Screenshots for analyzing your screengrabs, a Now Playing widget for the home screen, and photo features such as Night Sight.\n\nIn some cases, Samsung has counterparts for those Pixel exclusives, and it has a few exclusives of its own that you don't get with Pixel phones. There's also the suite of Good Lock modules that take phone customization and tweaking to the next level: You can set different volume levels for different apps, design your own themes, and take more control over your home screen, for example.\n\nI don't want to talk too much about hardware differences, because these change regularly with each passing year (or even every six months), but there's no doubt that hardware design comes into play when you're choosing a smartphone—and broadly speaking, I think most people will agree that Samsung's phones are more sleek and stylish.\n\nAesthetics are subjective, but the Samsung Galaxy series look closer to the polish and refinement of the iPhones, whereas Google takes a more simplified and industrial approach to its Pixels: Look at that chunky rear camera bar for example (which to be fair does help when a phone is laid flat).\n\nPerformance is difficult to gauge, but it's fair to say that the Snapdragon (and even Exynos) chipsets that Samsung uses have a better reputation than the Tensor CPUs that Google puts in its Pixel phones. That said, there's an argument to be made that Google wins on camera lens quality, which is something the Galaxy series hasn't really moved the needle much on in recent years.\n\nWhat's indisputable is that Android updates roll out to Google phones several months before Samsung phones: Samsung needs time to adapt the AOSP code for its own One UI release, and so if you want to get the latest Android features before anyone else, the Pixel series is your best bet.\n\nIf I'm buying a new Android phone for myself, I'll still usually go with a Google Pixel. The software interface is a little more rudimentary, but I don't mind that, and I use so many Google apps so regularly—Gmail, Google Chat, Google Maps, Google Keep—that I want the most friction-free and seamless access to them possible. I don't want or need a bunch of Samsung apps too.\n\nThat's not to say Galaxy phones don't have their appeal, and I like tinkering around with some of the extra features and hacks you don't get with Pixels—like the secret wifi menu, for example, or the built-in easy mode. Ultimately, though, Pixels feel more intuitive and easier to use for me, and I absolutely want to be first in the queue for Android updates.\n\nAdmittedly, part of this is down to familiarity. I've been using Google phones more regularly for across a longer span of time than Samsung phones, and I'm used to them and the way they work—if you're a seasoned Galaxy phone owner, then the benefits of a Pixel probably won't have as much appeal, considering you're going to have to get used to a different set of options and menus.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every 'Google TV Streamer' User Should Know",
    "description": "These tweaks will help you declutter the home screen, sideload other apps, and ensure you never lose your remote again.",
    "fullText": "The launch of the Google TV Streamer marked a significant shift for the company's streaming lineup, moving away from the behind-the-TV Chromecast dongles it popularized and introducing a pill-shaped set-top box that blends in nicely on a shelf of tchotchkes. It's hiding a worthy processor, double the memory you'd get from a streaming stick, and enough storage to download what you need to run all of your apps. It even acts as a smart hub, with Matter and Thread built in.\n\nIt's taken me a long time to do anything with the Google TV Streamer. I reluctantly brought it into my home after realizing something more robust, but dated, like the Nvidia Shield, would be too much to manage alongside maintaining a home server. But since then, I've tweaked several things on the set-top box and enabled features I hadn't been using, turning it into a helpful hub in my living room.\n\nThis sounds like an obvious tip, but I've had the Google TV Streamer since it debuted in 2024, and it wasn't until this week, while writing this piece, that I finally enabled the remote finder. I had skipped it during the initial setup. The option is available in Settings > Remotes & Accessories. You'll see the Find my remote option in there.\n\nThe Google TV Streamer has a physical button on the back of the device that lets you locate your remote if it's stuck somewhere on the couch. But what if you can't reach the streamer behind the TV? Try one of your Google-enabled voice devices instead. If you have a Nest speaker or a Pixel phone nearby, say \"Hey Google, find my remote.\" The remote should start chirping if you've set it up.\n\nThe remotes that come with the Google TV Streamer feature a tiny, unregistered button with a star icon right next to the power button. By default, this shortcut does nothing! But you can change that in the device's system preferences.\n\nIn Settings > Remotes & Accessories > Set up remote buttons, select one of three options for customizing the shortcut button. I set it up as my Google Home shortcut so I can easily turn the lights on and off from the couch. You can also set it up as a launcher for another app installed on the set-top box. Or create a shortcut to cycle through device inputs—this button is on legacy Chromecast devices with an included remote. It was removed from this generation of streaming devices, so if you miss it, you can spoof it back.\n\nFor serious power users, map the shortcut to an app like Projectivity Launcher to make it a more powerful launcher button.\n\nDon't care for the default YouTube or Netflix buttons included on the Google TV Streamer remote? You can remap them with a third-party app, then affix a small sticker to indicate what it does. Install an app like Button Mapper or tvQuickActions. Then go to Google TV Settings > System > Accessibility, and turn on the service. After that, you can head back into the app to adjust what those physical buttons do. You can set them as shortcuts to other apps, or even something cheekier for others to discover when they press the button.\n\nCan't stand all the recommendations and sponsored content Google TV suggests in the main carousel? You can effectively shut off some of the clutter so it doesn't visually overwhelm you. Go to Settings > Accounts & Sign-In > Your Account. and toggle on Apps only mode.\n\nThis clears the clutter and \"sponsored\" content, leaving you with just app icons. Keep in mind that this turns off the \"Watchlist\" feature that's tied to your account and some Gemini voice search capabilities for specific content.\n\nYou'll need to enable developer options to enable features like faster animations and side-loading apps. It's easy to set up, and it's just like on an Android smartphone. Head into Settings > System > About, then tap Android TV OS Build 7 times.\n\nYou'll see a little dialog pop up to let you know you've got developer access. Once enabled, a new menu will appear under Settings > System > Developer options.\n\nThe Google TV interface is organized and functional, but its animations can slow down menu navigation. You can eliminate these animations and tweak other visual elements to speed things up deep within the developer settings.\n\nIn Developer Options, scroll down to Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale. Change one of these, or all three, from 1x to Animation off to turn off animations completely. You can also go the other way and effectively \"overclock\" the animations to speed them up, making them appear smoother.\n\nWith developer options turned on, you can enable USB and wireless debugging to use apps like Send Files to TV and atvTools to sideload APKs. But first, enable the \"Allow installs from unknown sources\" option in the Developer Options under Security settings. This allows APKs you've transferred over to the device to run on the streamer.\n\nWhy would you want to go through the fuss of connecting to the Google TV Streamer this way? Because then you could access alternative streaming apps not available in the Play Store, or even an alternative launcher, like LeanbackLauncher.\n\nThis is one of my favorite little hacks that comes especially in handy when living in a house occupied by other people. When I do my workouts in the living room, I use a set of Bluetooth earbuds connected to the Google TV Streamer so I can hear the instructor's directions even when I'm face down in a plank and my kid is screaming in the background.\n\nThe ability is available in the same submenu where you set up your remote. In Settings > Remote & Accessories > Pair Remote/Accessory, put your audio device into Bluetooth pairing mode, then watch it come up on the screen as an option. If you're successful, you can now pop on the buds when you need to. Be aware that audio latency can occur, and you might need to restart the connection—it is Bluetooth, after all.\n\nIf you don't care about your bandwidth and want full-resolution streaming at all times, you can set the best resolution to display as the default in your Google TV Streamer preferences. Go to Settings > Display & Sound > Resolution. Switch the Resolution from \"Automatic\" to 4K 60Hz, or whatever your TV's peak is. Once this is enabled, the Google TV Streamer won't downscale to 1080p. If you're a sucker for HDR, this is the same menu where you can turn it on so that it's always in high definition.\n\nThe USB-C port can do more than charge up the Google TV Streamer. You can plug in a power delivery hub with extra ports to add components like external storage and effectively run your own all-in-one home media center. Those power delivery hubs usually include extra USB ports for peripherals, so you can hook up things like keyboards and game controllers for extra fun.",

    "description": "The next time your smartwatch buzzes to remind you to stand, don't ignore it.",
    "fullText": "Hitting 10,000 steps every day is a bullshit goal. Step counts can feel daunting, especially for people who work desk jobs or have physical limitations. The mere pressure to hit 10,000 steps can become its own source of stress—miss the goal by a few thousand steps, and it's easy to feel like the whole day was a wash. Rather than obsessing over hitting a specific step count, consider shifting your focus to a simpler, more achievable goal: sitting less. This reframing is not only easier to sustain, it could be just as beneficial for your health.\n\n\"Spending the bulk of your time seated is a major contributor to increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke,\" says Pamela Light, a certified personal trainer at Bay Club. And if you think you can't afford to take movement breaks during a busy workday, know that you don't need to transform into a marathon runner or achieve some lofty daily step count to see real health benefits. Simply interrupting your sitting time throughout the day can make a meaningful difference.\n\n\"Just ten minutes of movement is enough to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while slowing down muscle loss,\" Light says. And the science backs this up. In fact, a 2022 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that ten minutes of moderate exercise daily would prevent more than 111,000 premature deaths a year. Small changes could have a major impact on your life.\n\nThe beauty of this approach is its simplicity and flexibility, especially compared to the stress of 10,000 steps. You don't need to do jumping jacks in the middle of your office or draw attention to yourself. Instead, try incorporating more movement to things you already do throughout the day. This could look like cleaning up around home, checking in with co-workers, helping with an extra chore, or walking around the block.\n\nEven bathroom breaks become opportunities for movement. \"Go to a restroom further away or on a different floor and take the stairs. Once inside, do 10 squats,\" Light says. \"They don't have to be huge or perfect, but giving the large muscles of your legs a chance to flex and release will feel great on your joints, boost your mood, and help your body to pull nutrients from the blood and into the muscles.\"\n\nOther ideas include pacing during phone calls and setting timers to remind yourself to take breaks. Besides, I know that when I get a chance to move, the time away from my desk will makes me more productive when I get back to it.\n\nInstead of chasing an arbitrary step count number that might feel out of reach, simply commit to stand up and move for a few minutes. Take a lap around the office, do some chair squats, or just stand and stretch for a moment. Instead of feeling guilty about what you didn't do, you can feel good about the small moments of movement you incorporated throughout your day.\n\nPlus, achievable goals are the ones we're most likely to stick with. If you're someone recovering from an injury, managing a chronic condition, working a demanding job, or simply new to thinking about movement, getting up once an hour is an achievable place to start.",

    "description": "The fun of watching sports is not knowing who will win—so why should watching highlights be any different?",
    "fullText": "Part of the fun of watching sports is that you don't know what's going to happen. TV shows and movies follow story beats, meaning you can usually get a sense for where things are heading, but sports do not work that way. The totally unexpected can, and does, frequently occur—and that's the reason people keep tuning in, whether their team is dominating or an underdog.\n\nSometimes, though, you can't catch the game live, but still want a bit of that feeling. That's why leagues offer extended highlights, featuring all the key moments, complete with the commentary from the broadcast. These can feel almost like watching the full game, and I love catching up with them the next day alongside my morning coffee. The problem: you'll typically find those videos on sites full of spoilers about who won, whether that's via a scoreboard at the top of the site or headlines blaring the results. If you're hoping for even a fraction of the fun of watching sports live, that's a problem.\n\nDon't Tell Me The Score is your solution. This simple website offers highlights for NFL, NHL, MLB, and NBA games, with no scores or spoilers of any kind. The site interface shows only a bunch of icons representing all upcoming and recent games. Color logos means there are highlights are already available, and you can click or tap to start watching.\n\nThis is my favorite way to catch up on games I missed. The videos, which are sourced from the league's official YouTube channels, tend to be a little over 10 minutes, meaning you'll see the highs and lows, but it won't take up hours of your day, and you won't know who won going in (provided you've also taken care to avoid spoilers via the TV, newspapers, social media, push notifications, or ill-timed texts from friends).\n\nThis tends to work really well, with one big hiccup: NFL videos can't be watched on the site itself, as the NFL prevents their highlights from being embedded on other sites. This means you'll need to click a link to watch the highlights on YouTube's website. This is a little annoying, but the YouTube pages usually don't include spoilers either, as long as you steer clear of the comments.\n\nI wish more leagues were supported—soccer highlights aren't offered at all, for example, and neither are the increasingly popular women's leagues. But if you're a fan of one of the \"big four\" North American sports, like watching highlights, and don't want to get spoiled first, Don't Tell Me The Score is worth adding to your daily rotation.",

    "description": "Take control of your Netflix viewing experience.",
    "fullText": "Let's face it, Netflix is no longer cheap. And if you're dedicating your valuable time and resources towards watching Netflix, you might want to see more than the same 10 shows everyone else is watching.\n\nIf your evening routine is still just opening Netflix, scrolling aimlessly for 20 minutes, and settling for the same three shows, it's time for an upgrade. Hidden beneath the surface of that simple interface are dozens of powerful settings, secret search codes, and third-party tools that can completely overhaul your viewing experience.\n\nLike every other popular streaming service, Netflix lets you download movies and TV shows for offline viewing. Ad-free plans can download up to 100 items per device, while ad-supported plans can download 15 items. And as long as you go online once every 30 days, you can keep that media on your device as long as you want.\n\nAnd if you're running low on space or your downloads are slow, you can adjust download quality to fix that. To adjust quality, open the Netflix app, go to your Profile, tap the Menu button at the top (the three horizontal lines), then go to App Settings > Downloads > Video Quality. Here, choose between Standard or Higher based on your storage space or network.\n\nNow, just tap the Download button next to an episode, season, or movie to download it. You’ll find downloaded media in the Downloads section in your Profile tab, where you can watch and delete shows.\n\nNetflix has an option that lets you log out of any connected devices from its website. That includes every device that all members of your account are using. So if you want to take away TV access from a friend, or someone who's somehow snuck into your account, this is the place to go.\n\nClick the Profile icon and go to Account. Here, switch to the Devices tab and choose Access and devices. Then, find a device you want to log out from and click Sign Out. You can also click the Sign Out of All Devices button to log out all devices together.\n\nNetflix has an obscure setting that's so weirdly worded that you'd never think it's about data collection. By default, Netflix shares your privacy-protected contact information with third parties to display ads on third-party services. That is something you should disable, and it's done on a per-profile basis.\n\nClick the Profile icon, go to Account, switch to the Profiles tab, choose your profile, and go to the Privacy and data settings option. Finally, disable Allow matched identifier communications. Repeat this for all the profiles on your account.\n\nNetflix's password sharing crack down is in full swing. If you cannot get around it, it might be time to create your own account. But that doesn't mean you need to start fresh with the algorithm. Netflix has a feature called Transfer Profiles that can help you take all your data from an old account to a new one.\n\nOpen the Netflix website and choose your profile. Then, click the Profile icon at the top and go to Transfer Profile. This will open up a wizard that'll walk you through the next steps. Click Start Profile Transfer and choose if you want to transfer to a brand-new account or to an existing one. Netflix will help you set up a new account with all your data already on it. If you're transferring to an existing account, you'll need to know the email and the password for the account. Follow the instructions to transfer your profile to a new account.\n\nWant to remove an embarrassing title from your Continue Watching list? Or perhaps a title that you’re never going to finish? Turns out you can help clear your Continue Watching List by removing a title from your Viewing Activity. As a bonus, this method also gets rid of any recommendations based on that content, as if you never watched it.\n\nTo do this, go to Netflix’s Viewing Activity page (you can also get there from Account > Profiles > Your Profile > Viewing Activity).\n\nClick the little Hide button next to the title that you want to remove. Confirm in the next step, and the title will disappear from your watch list.\n\nIf you're fine with Netflix tuning your recommendations around something you've watched, but still want to remove it from your Continue Watching list, you can do that, too. Depending on the platform, the steps are slightly different.\n\nIf you're watching in the mobile app, tap on the three-dotted menu icon below the show or movie's poster, and choose Remove from row. From the popup, tap the Remove button to confirm. On the website, simply hover over the thumbnail and click the \"X\" button to remove it from the list. If you're using the TV app, press and hold your remote's main button to go to the details page. Then, tap the Remove from Continue Watching button.\n\nIt's no secret that Netflix has a different media catalog for each country. Depending on which one you choose, you can use a VPN to bypass this. You can access all the K-dramas streaming in Korea, while sitting in your home in the U.S. You can use a free VPN, sure, but for fast streaming, a paid and secure VPN might be the best option (NordVPN is a secure and budget-friendly option). As a bonus, it will also encrypt your traffic and protect your data when you're connected to public networks.\n\nIf you watch Netflix on the way to work, or if you have a spotty internet connection, the Smart Downloads feature can be a game changer. Once enabled, this will automatically delete completed episodes and replace them with subsequent episodes when you’re back on Wi-Fi. You can also turn on \"Downloads for you,\" which automatically downloads content Netflix thinks you'll like. You can enable these features on the iOS and Android apps from Profile > Menu > App Settings > Smart Downloads.\n\nIf you like watching Netflix while you’re out and about, it can eat into your mobile data plan pretty easily. Netflix’s data saver mode can help with that. In the Netflix app, go to Profile > Menu > App Settings > Cellular Data Usage. Here, disable the Automatic feature and switch to the Save Data option. This will adjust video quality while you're off wifi to allow for about six hours of playback per GB of data.\n\nIt would be a shame to pay for the 4K Netflix plan but only watch in 720p because you didn’t adjust your settings. Go to Netflix’s playback settings page, and from the Data Usage Per Screen option, switch to the High option. Now, you’ll get the best quality for the device or screen that you’re on.\n\nNetflix loves autoplaying. Whether the app’s playing the next episode or a new movie right after you’re done watching something, or playing previews on the home screen, it can get pretty annoying.\n\nYou can disable both features on a profile-by-profile basis. After opening the Netflix website, go to the Profiles screen. Here, click the Manage Profiles button and choose the profile where you want to disable these features.\n\nNow, uncheck Autoplay next episode and Autoplay previews. Click the Save button to save your preferences.\n\nAre Netflix's default subtitles too hard to read? You can change the subtitle font, color, and size. From the Netflix website, click the Profile icon and choose Account. Here, switch to the Profiles tab and select your profile. Now, choose the Subtitle Appearance option.\n\nFrom here, you can change the subtitle font, text size, shadow, background color, and window color. Once you’re done, tap the Save button to save your settings.\n\nWhen you’re watching a foreign language film, Netflix has a habit of defaulting to English language dubbing. Sadly, there’s no setting to stop Netflix from doing that, but there’s always a way to switch to the original audio in the Netflix player. When you’re watching something, go to the Subtitles menu, and from the Audio section, switch to the Original audio.\n\nIf you share your Netflix account with your friends or family, your profile isn’t exactly private. Others can see what you’ve been watching, and they can also use your profile and mess up your recommendations.\n\nIf you want to protect your profile (especially if you share your account with your kids), click the Profiles icon and choose the Account option. Switch to the Profiles tab, choose your profile, and go to the Profile Lock section. Then, click Create a Profile lock.\n\nEnter your account password, and from the next page, enter the four-digit pin and click the Save button. The next time you open Netflix, you’ll need to enter this pin to access your profile.\n\nIf you’re sharing your Netflix account with your kids or teenagers, you might want to block adult content. To do this, go to the Profiles tab in your Account and choose your profile. Here, go to the Adjust Parental Controls section and enter your account password.\n\nFrom the top, you can change the profile's maturity rating (7+ to 18+). If you want, you can also turn the current profile into a children’s profile, which only shows content suitable for children. From the bottom, you can even choose to block a particular TV show or movie. Once you’re done, click the Save button.\n\nNetflix has finally added an option for dialogue-only subtitles, and while they're not on every show, the company plans to support them on at least every new Netflix Original going forward.\n\nThis new subtitle option removes commentary and stage directions from subtitles. So you won't see details about the background music or heavy breathing. You'll just see character dialogue.\n\nTo switch to this option, start streaming a compatible show or movie on Netflix and head to the Subtitles section. Here, choose English (or the language of your choice) in the Audio section, and English (or, again, whatever language you want) in the Subtitles section. If you want to revert to the classic subtitles style, switch to an option with \"(CC)\" in the name.\n\nNetflix's search feature is pretty great, but the way its app organizes content kind of sucks. On the home screen, you might keep seeing the same popular content repeated in different sections. If you want to discover new content in a particular genre, style, or language, there is a better way. And that's to use Netflix's secret codes.\n\nNetflix has codes for every kind of movie category and subcategory that you can imagine. There are 20 broad categories to start with, but there are 267 categories in total, each with their own unique code. You can find a list of all the secret codes at Netflix-Codes.com. Just enter the code in the Netflix search bar (or click the linked URL) to browse content tagged with it.\n\nYou can also enter these codes into a Netflix URL yourself. So, to view \"Asian action movies\", you'd navigate to https://netflix.com/browse/genre/77232.\n\nThere's nothing quite as annoying as accidentally brushing your phone or tablet screen while watching Netflix and pausing a movie, skipping ahead, or turning on subtitles. To me, this happens mostly when I'm traveling or watching in bed. Netflix has a solution for this, though, in the form of a screen lock. When you're watching something, tap the screen to bring up player controls, and then tap the Lock button. Now, no matter how much you swipe, you won't end up changing the volume randomly. How to unlock it, you ask? Tap on the screen again, tap the Screen Locked button, and tap once again to unlock the screen.\n\nTrim is a neat little Chrome extension that provides you contextual information about movies and TV shows, so you don't have to open different websites to find them. You'll see ratings and reviews from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes for any given show right on its Netflix page, saving you a click before you choose what you want to watch.\n\nLastly, you can try the Netflix Enhanced Chrome extension to add some small quality-of-life improvements to Netflix. It automatically skips intros, and plays the next episode immediately after the current one ends, saving you some clicks and valuable time. You can also use nifty keyboard shortcuts, like pressing \"N\" to go to the next episode, using the arrow key to change the volume, and more.",

    "fullText": "A university cricket club has been suspended for the rest of the academic year, with players banned, following an investigation into reports of serious misconduct.\n\nConcerns first emerged in October about the behaviour of members of the Cardiff University sports team during an initiation event at a pub in the city.\n\nCardiff University Students' Union confirmed the men's cricket club would be suspended and that committee members involved would no longer be allowed to represent the university in cricket.\n\nIn a statement, the union said it had a \"zero-tolerance position on initiation-type behaviour\", while the university - which is separate to the union - said it would consider next steps.\n\nThe union added: \"These behaviours were inconsistent with our code of conduct, breached explicit guidance that had been repeatedly communicated to the club committee in advance, and raised significant concerns around student safety and welfare.\n\n\"Our approach is guided by a clear duty of care to students and a zero-tolerance position on initiation-type behaviour.\n\n\"While we want students to take part in sport and social activity, we will act where evidence shows our expectations have not been met to ensure activity is run responsibly.\"\n\nThe union said it was taking steps to establish a cricket programme administered directly by the Students' Union for students not involved in the reported behaviour.\n\nIt also said it would consider applications from students to establish a men's cricket club in a future academic year, but any future application would be subject to \"robust scrutiny\".\n\nIt added it would be writing to all sports club members to reiterate the standards of behaviour required of anyone representing the students' union or the wider university.\n\nA Cardiff University spokesperson said: \"We want to be clear, initiations have no place at Cardiff University and we reserve the right to investigate using our student conduct regulations.\n\n\"We will need to consider our next steps and consider what, if any, action the university might need to take\", urging any students impacted to get in touch.",

    "fullText": "Having missed last year's Six Nations because of his British and Irish Lions commitments, Ireland head coach Andy Farrell has been quickly reminded of the headaches that are part and parcel of preparing a squad before the championship.\n\nFarrell is, of course, no stranger to squad-related stresses. In 2023, Jamison Gibson-Park and Cian Healy both withdrew injured from the matchday squad just hours before Ireland's Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff.\n\nIreland won that game 34-10 and went on to secure the Grand Slam, but the build-up to next week's curtain-raiser against holders France in Paris has felt particularly trying.\n\nA few issues at least emerged well in advance. In early December, Connacht said it would be \"months for sure\" before Mack Hansen, a strong option at wing or full-back, returns from a foot injury.\n\nBut the problems have continued to mount for Farrell since he named a 37-man squad on 21 January.\n\nWith Andrew Porter and Paddy McCarthy already sidelined, Farrell's hand at loose-head prop was further weakened when Jack Boyle withdrew from the squad after sustaining a bad leg injury in Leinster's win over Connacht last weekend.\n\nGiven Ireland's chastening evening against South Africa's scrum in November, their absence may be keenly felt.\n\nMunster flanker Tom Ahern also withdrew, with the uncapped Billy Bohan and Cormac Izuchukwu drafted in, but further problems have emerged after Ireland touched down in Portugal for their usual pre-tournament training camp.\n\nHaving already admitted that his injury list is \"larger than normal\", Farrell has lost full-back Hugo Keenan to a fractured thumb.\n\nKeenan's training-ground injury is a cruel blow for the 29-year-old after having only returned from the hip problem that has kept him out since his star turn for the Lions last summer.\n\nWith the fly-half debate ongoing, 15 is now a problem position for Farrell. Jamie Osborne started there against New Zealand and Japan in November, and while he is in the squad, he has not played since the win over the Brave Blossoms.\n\nUlster's Jacob Stockdale, Leinster's Ciaran Frawley and Munster's Jack Crowley - who is also battling Sam Prendergast and Harry Byrne for the 10 shirt - are all options for Farrell to consider.",

During winter, the polar jet stream transports cold, Arctic air southward across the plains of Canada and the United States, then eastward toward the Atlantic Ocean where warm air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic tries to move northward.\n\nThe warm waters of the Gulf Stream help keep the coastal waters relatively mild during the winter, which in turn helps warm the cold winter air over the water. This difference in temperature between the warm air over the water and cold Arctic air over the land is the fuel that feeds nor'easters.\n\nSome well-known nor'easters include the New England blizzard of February 1978, the March 1993 \"Superstorm\" and the Boston snowstorms of January and February 2015, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",

    "fullText": "Interim manager Martin O'Neill is \"disappointed\" the Scottish FA fast-track tribunal rejected Celtic's appeal against Auston Trusty's red card against Heart of Midlothian.\n\nThe United States centre-half brought down Hearts striker Pierre Landry Kabore on Sunday and was initially shown a yellow card by referee Steven McLean.\n\nThe video assistant referee (VAR) advised an on-field review and McLean deemed Trusty had denied a goalscoring opportunity, so upgraded the yellow card to red.\n\nHearts then equalised to earn a draw that maintained their six-point lead over the defending champions in the Scottish Premiership.\n\nThe decision of the officials was backed by the tribunal on Tuesday and Trusty will be suspended for this weekend's game against Falkirk.\n\nCeltic said they \"will be ensuring further discussions with the SFA\" as they \"seek to understand the rationale for this and other decisions\".\n\nO'Neill, who insisted after the game he \"did not see\" how it could be a red card, said on Wednesday that \"it was nice to get the backing of a lot of referees who've refereed big, big matches when they were interviewed afterwards\".\n\n\"I never had a problem with it in my first spell here 25 years ago - I just expected no decisions to come our way!\" joked the 73-year-old when asked about the standard of refereeing in Scotland.\n\n\"I have a lot of paranoia about me. I'm seeing a shrink at the moment about it. I'm perfectly all right... but he's not.\"\n\nO'Neill, in interim charge for a second period this season, conceded that Celtic \"obviously need to strengthen the squad\" before the winter transfer window closes.\n\n\"It's what we are trying to do. Whether we have anyone in before the weekend, I don't know, but we are making strenuous efforts,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we can do something. The days are pressing, but I'm hopeful. I'm reasonably confident we can do it.\n\n\"If we get through in the Europa League, there are at least a couple of games and you need a proper squad for that.\n\n\"We're trying to get as much quality as possible. Lots of names have been put forward - lots of people I've taken an interest in, one or two have been thwarted. But we're working on it.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave a full-throated defense Wednesday of President Donald Trump's military operation to oust and arrest then-Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, while also using his wide-ranging congressional testimony to touch on Greenland, NATO, Iran and China.\n\nAs Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee offered starkly different readings of the administration's foreign policy, Rubio addressed Trump's intentions and his often bellicose rhetoric that have alarmed U.S. allies in Europe and elsewhere.\n\nIn the first public hearing since the Jan. 3 intervention to depose Maduro, Rubio said Trump had acted to take out a major U.S. national security threat in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's top diplomat said America was safer and more secure as a result and that the Republican administration would work with interim authorities to stabilize the South American country.\n\n“We’re not going to have this thing turn around overnight, but I think we’re making good and decent progress,” Rubio said. “We are certainly better off today in Venezuela than we were four weeks ago and I think and hope and expect that we’ll be better off in three months and six months and nine months than we would have been had Maduro still been there.\"\n\nThe former Florida senator said that Venezuela's current leaders are cooperating and would soon begin to see benefits. But he backed away from remarks prepared for the hearing that Washington would not hesitate to take further military action should those leaders not fully accept Trump's demands.\n\n“I can tell you right now with full certainty, we are not postured to nor do we intend or expect to have to take any military action in Venezuela at any time,\" Rubio said. “I think it would require the emergence of an imminent threat of the kind that we do not anticipate at this time.”\n\nHe said Venezuela soon will be allowed to sell oil that is now subject to U.S. sanctions. The revenue would be set aside to pay for basic government services such as policing and health care. Oil sale money will be deposited in a U.S. Treasury-controlled account and released after the U.S. approves monthly budgets to be submitted by Venezuela, he said.\n\nPushback against skepticism from Democrats\n\nRepublican senators, with few exceptions, praised the Venezuelan operation. Among Democrats, there was deep skepticism.\n\nThey questioned Trump's policies in Venezuela and their potential for encouraging moves by China against Taiwan and Russia even more so in Ukraine, as well as his threats to take Greenland from NATO ally Denmark and his insults about the alliance's contributions to U.S. security.\n\nHe said the uproar over Greenland within NATO is calming and that talks are underway about how to deal with Trump's demands. The Republican president insists the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China, but he recently backed away from a pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries that sent troops to the semiautonomous Danish territory in a show of solidarity.\n\n“I think we’re going to get something positive done,\" Rubio said.\n\nRubio dismissed criticism that Trump was undermining the alliance, while repeating the long-running American complaint that member nations need to boost their defense budgets.\n\n“NATO needs to be reimagined.” Rubio said. “I just think this president complains about it louder than other presidents.\"\n\nHe said China's stated goal to reunify Taiwan with the mainland would not be affected by any other world event, including the Maduro operation.\n\n“The situation on Taiwan is a legacy project\" that Chinese President Xi Jinping has made \"very clear that that’s what he intends to do and that’s going to be irrespective anything that happens in the world,” Rubio said.\n\nAs Trump once more threatens Iran with military action, Rubio said there was no current plan to attack. Asked about the potential for a change of government in Tehran, Rubio said that would require “a lot of careful thinking” because it would be “far more complex” than ousting Maduro.\n\nMore details about the raid in Caracas\n\nThe committee chairman, Idaho Sen. Jim Risch, praised Trump’s decisions to remove Maduro, continue deadly military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean and seize sanctioned tankers.\n\nRisch also offered new details on the operation in the Venezuelan capital, saying it involved “only about 200 troops” and a “firefight that lasted less than 27 minutes.”\n\n“This military action was incredibly brief, targeted and successful,” Risch said, adding that the U.S. and other nations may have to assist Venezuela when it seeks to restore democratic elections. ”Venezuela may require U.S. and international oversight to ensure these elections are indeed free and fair,” he said.\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the committee's top Democrat, questioned whether that operation was worth it, considering most of Maduro's top aides and lieutenants still run the Venezuela and the economic situation there remains bleak.\n\n\"We’ve traded one dictator for another, so it’s no wonder that so many of my constituents are asking, why is the president spending so much time focused on Venezuela instead of the cost of living and their kitchen table economic concerns?\" she asked. “From Venezuela to Europe, the United States is spending more, risking more and achieving less.”\n\nCongress hasn't curtailed Trump on Venezuela\n\nCongressional Democrats have condemned Trump’s moves as exceeding the authority of the executive branch, while most Republicans have supported them as a legitimate exercise of presidential power.\n\nThe GOP-led House narrowly defeated a war powers act resolution that would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. As Rubio argued, the administration says there are no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela despite a large military buildup in the region.\n\nDemocrats contended the resolution was necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Maduro and because Trump has stated plans to control the country’s oil industry for years to come.\n\nFamilies of two Trinidadian nationals killed in an administration boat strike filed what is thought to be the first wrongful-death case arising from that campaign. Three dozen strikes on boats in the region have killed at least 126 people since September.\n\nUS acts to normalize ties while issuing warnings\n\nWhile keeping pressure on those the U.S. calls “narcotraffickers” without providing evidence, officials also are working to normalize ties with Venezuela's acting president, Delcy Rodríguez.\n\nThe administration has said its demands for Rodriguez include opening Venezuela’s energy sector to U.S. companies, providing preferential access to production, using oil revenue to purchase American goods, and ending subsidized oil exports to Cuba.\n\nRodríguez, who was Maduro's vice president, said Tuesday that her government and the U.S. “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication.” And so far, she has appeared to acquiesce to Trump’s demands and to release prisoners jailed by the government under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.\n\nIn a key step to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the State Department notified Congress this week that it intends to begin sending additional diplomatic and support personnel to Caracas to prepare for the possible reopening of the U.S. Embassy, which shuttered in 2019. Fully normalizing ties, however, would require the U.S. to revoke its decision recognizing the Venezuelan parliament elected in 2015 as the country’s legitimate government.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rubio was to meet Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the State Department.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — A Texas man who at one time escaped from custody and was on the run for three days after being sentenced to death for fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend nearly 27 years ago was scheduled on Wednesday to be the first person executed in the U.S. this year.\n\nCharles Victor Thompson was condemned for the April 1998 shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend, Glenda Dennise Hayslip, 39; and her new boyfriend, Darren Keith Cain, 30, at her apartment in the Houston suburb of Tomball.\n\nThompson, 55, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.\n\nProsecutors say Thompson and Hayslip had been romantically involved for a year but split after Thompson “became increasingly possessive, jealous and abusive.”\n\nAccording to court records, Hayslip and Cain were dating when Thompson came to Hayslip’s apartment and began arguing with Cain around 3 a.m. the night of the killings. Police were called and told Thompson to leave the apartment complex. Thompson returned three hours later and shot both Hayslip and Cain, who died at the scene. Hayslip died in the hospital a week later.\n\n“The Hayslip and Cain families have waited over twenty-five years for justice to occur,” prosecutors with the Harris County District Attorney’s Office said in court filings.\n\nThompson’s attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution, arguing Thompson was not allowed to refute or confront the prosecution's evidence that concluded Hayslip died from a gunshot wound to the face. Thompson's attorneys have argued Hayslip actually died from flawed medical care she received after the shooting that resulted in severe brain damage sustained from oxygen deprivation following a failed intubation.\n\nThe Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied Thompson’s request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.\n\n“If he had been able to raise a reasonable doubt as to the cause of Ms. Hayslip’s death, he would not be guilty of capital murder,” Thompson’s attorneys said in court filings with the Supreme Court.\n\nProsecutors said a jury has already rejected the claim and, concluded under state law that Thompson is responsible for Hayslip’s death because it “would not have occurred but for his conduct.”\n\nHayslip’s family had filed a lawsuit against one of her doctors, alleging medical negligence during her treatment left her brain-dead. A jury in 2002 found in favor of the doctor.\n\nThompson had his death sentence overturned and had a new punishment trial held in November 2005. A jury again ordered him to die by lethal injection.\n\nShortly after being resentenced, Thompson escaped from the Harris County Jail in Houston by walking out the front door virtually unchallenged by deputies. Thompson later told The Associated Press that after meeting with his attorney in a small interview cell, he slipped out of his handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuit and left the room, which was unlocked. Thompson waived an ID badge fashioned out of his prison ID card to get past several deputies.\n\n“I got to smell the trees, feel the wind in my hair, grass under my feet, see the stars at night. It took me straight back to childhood being outside on a summer night,” Thompson said about his three days on the run during a 2005 interview with the AP. He was arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, while trying to arrange for wire transfers of money from overseas so he could make it to Canada.\n\nIf the execution is carried out, Thompson would be the first person put to death this year in the United States. Texas has historically held more executions than any other state, though Florida had the most executions in 2025, with 19.\n\nFollow Juan A. Lozano: https://x.com/juanlozano70",

    "description": "The Dispatch published a rare, unsparing editorial raking President Donald Trump and his \"enablers\" in the GOP over the coals on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "The Dispatch, a conservative publication founded by former Fox News contributors Jonah Goldberg and Stephen Hayes, published a rare, unsparing editorial raking President Donald Trump and his “enablers” in the GOP over the coals on Wednesday.\n\nUnder the headline “The Cost of Silence,” The Dispatch‘s editors described a dismal state of affairs, pointing to the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, the manufactured crisis over Greenland, Canada’s cozying up to China, continued economic uncertainty, and the criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as examples of the chaos invited by the Trump administration.\n\n“One of the ironies repeated throughout world political history is that autocrats rarely bring the order they are elected—or installed—to deliver, even the servile kind that can be imposed through state terror. No, more reliably, autocrats bring disorder,” they argued. “The disorder under which Americans are now suffering, the ramifications of which have only just begun to be realized, is what inevitably happens when an American president disregards the rule of law, insisting that he is limited only by his own sense of morality—a sense of morality that in this case does not quite seem to exist.”\n\nWe are aware that Dispatch readers have read and heard us repeat these points a thousand times in articles and on podcasts, and we are equally aware that a Dispatch editorial, while rare, is not going to be the “J’accuse!” that forces the powers that be to rethink where they are and what has brought them there. But we will repeat ourselves nonetheless: Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified for the office of the presidency, himself a man with no sense of integrity or administrative acumen, and one who is lazy, vain, ignorant, and vulnerable to flattery — all of which make him easy to manipulate for figures such as Stephen Miller, whose ethnonationalist obsessions and sophomoric Nietzschean posturing have dominated the administration’s agenda for months and who is emblematic of the types of advisers with whom the president has surrounded himself this second go-round.\n\n“But Trump is far from the only one at fault for the mess in which we find ourselves,” submitted The Dispatch, turning its attention briefly to former President Joe Biden, and then congressional Republicans.\n\n“When the history of our time is written, congressional leaders—particularly Republican congressional leaders—will be remembered as more important, and much more culpable, than it seems at this moment. Describing their careers as inaction would be too charitable; they have been enablers not only of the particular crimes of the Trump administration but of the more general aggrandizement of the presidency and the subordination of the entire legislative branch—the branch created by Article I of our Constitution to make laws and exercise oversight of federal agencies,” it argued. “They are, in a very real sense, in gross violation of their oaths of office, and so too are the representatives and senators of both parties who have contributed over the years to the reduction of Congress to its current miserable state.”\n\nAfter posing a hard-hitting question to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) — “If you cannot act in the face of this—all this — why do you choose to remain in the Senate at all?” — the editorial concluded thusly:\n\nDante put his cowards and opportunists — those who refused to take a stand in life — in the vestibule of his inferno: It isn’t Hell proper, but you can see the rest of the underworld from there. The cowards and opportunists in the United States in 2026 stand at a precipice, too, and have brought our country to the verge of something awful and unspeakable. We got here one step at a time — let us hope that we remember the way back.\n\nThe post The Dispatch Warns Trump and GOP Have ‘Brought Our Country to the Verge of Something Awful and Unspeakable’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "More than 100,000 people visit emergency departments each year due to exposure.",
    "fullText": "The tragic death of two people in South Carolina prompted officials to release a warning about the dangers of using generators indoors.\n\nThe Greenville News reported that two people in North Carolina's Anderson County died from carbon monoxide poisoning in December after using a generator to heat their home. In response to the incident, County Coroner Greg Shore issued a reminder that using generators indoors is never safe due to the toxic fumes they release into the air.\n\n\"Using alternative methods beyond central heating, like gas logs, to keep warm, or using a generator to power things, can emit carbon monoxide,\" the Greenville News said. \"This invisible, odorless gas can be deadly.\"\n\nBecause carbon monoxide has no color, taste, or odor, it can be difficult to detect, and that's why it's so deadly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 400 Americans die each year from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning not linked to fires. The agency adds that more than 100,000 people visit emergency departments each year due to carbon monoxide exposure, and that more than 14,000 are hospitalized.\n\nGenerators are not the only appliances that can release carbon monoxide into the home — any appliance that burns fuel, including furnaces, water heaters, stoves, and fireplaces, is a potential culprit. Still, portable generators are of particular concern, and federal data showed that at least 770 people in the U.S. died between 2011 and 2021 due to carbon monoxide poisoning while using portable generators.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people install a battery-operated or battery-backup carbon monoxide detector in every sleeping area of the home. The agency also urges people to have gas-, oil-, and coal-burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician annually and to make sure these devices are vented properly.\n\nAnd if you ever feel symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning — headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion — it's important to get outside immediately.\n\nOne other way to help reduce your risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is to power your home with solar paired with battery storage for backup. Solar is a safer bet for the home, and a battery setup ensures you have adequate power during blackouts while avoiding the potentially deadly consequences of generator use — a new federal report found that even outdoor generators pose a safety concern.\n\nDo you have a backup power system at your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": ", Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate with the Trump administration by formally cutting ties with U.S. adversaries, four people familiar with the reports said in recent days.\n\nU.S. officials have ​said publicly they want the interim president to sever relations with close international allies like Iran, China and Russia, including expelling their diplomats and advisers from Venezuela.\n\nBut ‌Rodriguez, whose swearing-in ceremony was attended by representatives of those countries early this month, has yet to publicly announce such a move. She became president after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3.\n\nThe ‌U.S. intelligence reports said it was not clear if she is fully on board with the U.S. strategy in her country, according to the sources, who declined to be identified by name.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled on January 15 to Caracas, where he discussed the country's political future with Rodriguez. Reuters could not determine if those conversations changed the intelligence agencies' opinion.\n\nWashington wants to rein in its foes' influence in the Western hemisphere, including in Venezuela, where Trump seeks to exploit the OPEC nation’s vast oil reserves.\n\nIf Rodriguez were to break ties with the U.S. rivals, ⁠it would open more opportunity for U.S. investment in Venezuela’s ‌energy sector. But failure to control Rodriguez could undercut Washington’s efforts to direct the country’s interim rulers from afar and avoid a deeper U.S. military role.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency and the Venezuela government did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAsked for comment, a senior Trump administration official, who ‍declined to be identified, said U.S. President Donald Trump \"continues to exert maximum leverage\" over Venezuela's leaders and \"expects this cooperation to continue.\"\n\nThe CIA has previously assessed that officials loyal to Maduro, including Rodriguez, were best positioned to govern the country following his ouster.\n\nBut critics of Trump's Venezuela strategy have expressed doubts about the wisdom of keeping Maduro's loyalists in place as the country's interim leaders. The concerns ​about Rodriguez' reliability were present prior to the U.S. military operation, said two sources.\n\nFor Venezuela, the U.S. directive means abandoning its closest allies outside the region. Iran has ‌helped Venezuela repair oil refineries while China has taken oil as repayment for debt. Russia has supplied weaponry, including missiles, to Venezuela's military.\n\nTrump has also cited communist-led Cuba as another U.S. foe he wants Venezuela to abandon. Havana has provided security and intelligence support while receiving cut-rate Venezuelan oil.\n\nSince Maduro's removal, Rodriguez, whose deep ties to the oil sector are crucial to keeping the country stable, has taken steps to stay in favor with Washington including releasing political prisoners and authorizing the sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States.\n\nIn a speech on Sunday, Rodriguez said she has had “enough” of U.S. intervention. Still, U.S. officials have also held positive calls with her in recent days, according ⁠to two of the sources.\n\nThe Trump administration does not see an immediate alternative to working with Rodriguez, ​given it has publicly backed her so strongly, two of the sources said.\n\nBut U.S. officials are developing ​contacts with senior military and security officials in case they decide to change their approach, a source briefed on Venezuela policy said.\n\nMACHADO CONSIDERED A LONGER-TERM OPTION TO RUN VENEZUELA\n\nThe recent intelligence reports also found that opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is not currently able to run the country successfully ‍in part because she lacks strong ties to ⁠the country’s security services or oil sector, the sources said.\n\nSome observers and Machado's movement say it won a 2024 election that year by a huge margin, though the state backed a Maduro victory. She remains popular with Venezuelans.\n\nTrump told reporters last week he wanted Machado “involved” in the country’s leadership, without providing details.\n\nOne person familiar with ⁠the administration’s discussions with Machado said she is well-liked by the White House and is considered a longer-term option for a leadership position in Venezuela.\n\nThe separate source briefed on Venezuela policy suggested that for now, Machado ‌could be considered for an advisory role but no firm decision had been made. Representatives for Machado did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Erin Banco, Jonathan Landay and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Don Durfee and Cynthia Osterman)",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance was accused of choosing “MAGA over Jesus” in a damning opinion piece published by the National Catholic Reporter this week.\n\nIn the piece, the Catholic newspaper’s digital editor, John Grosso, rebuked Vance’s inflammatory and politicizing response to the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis over the weekend.\n\nPolitics: Democrats Escalate Impeachment Push Against Kristi Noem\n\nRead the full opinion piece at the National Catholic Reporter.\n\nVance, said Grosso, had “the opportunity to call for peace and unity — to lower the temperature of the situation and express empathy with those suffering and mourning” and “could have chosen to share the Gospel message of healing and human dignity” but “instead, he chose to offer the MAGA message of division and blame.”\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive. Support HuffPost.\n\nThe comments of Vance, a Catholic convert, are “a moral stain on our collective witness of Catholicism,” said Grosso. But “they are no longer surprising,” he argued. “Given its scandal, the vice president’s cafeteria Catholicism must continue to be repudiated by people of faith.”\n\nGrosso published a similar blistering commentary about Vance following the vice president’s justification of the fatal shooting of mother Renee Good, also at the hands of a federal agent in Minneapolis, earlier this month.\n\n“As a Catholic, Vance knows better than to peddle this brand of gaslighting and agitation,” Grosso wrote in that piece, in which he also condemned Vance’s “twisted and wrongheaded view of Christianity” and suggested his “Catholicism seems to be little more than a political prop, a tool only for his career ambitions and desire for power.”\n\nHarry Enten Says Trump Is Facing The Comparison He Dreads Most\n\n'They’re Not Welcome': Anger In Italy Over ICE Role At Winter Olympics\n\nEx-FIFA President Joins Calls For Boycott Of World Cup In U.S. -- Because Of Trump",

    "description": "The Utah Geological Survey (UGS) has completed a project forming new high-resolution maps of active faults throughout central Utah, a geologically critical area, which geologists said give a clearer view of earthquake risk in the state.",
    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (ABC4) — The Utah Geological Survey (UGS) has completed a project forming new high-resolution maps of active faults throughout central Utah, a geologically critical area, which geologists said give a clearer view of earthquake risk in the state.\n\nPrevious fault mapping focused mostly on the Wasatch Front, according to the UGS. The new project looked at central Utah, an area UGS described as “a geologically-critical transition zone between the actively extending Basin and Range Province and the stable Colorado Plateau.”\n\nThe study covered parts of Garfield, Juab, Millard, Piute, Sanpete, and Sevier counties. Additionally, experts said the region is transforming amid population growth and infrastructure development.\n\n“This region is home to growing communities, vital infrastructure, and major transportation routes,” UGS said in a press release. “The area has a history of powerful seismic events, including two of Utah’s largest historical earthquakes: the 1901 M6.6 Tushar Mountains and 1921 M6.0 Elsinore earthquakes, both of which caused widespread damage in the Sevier Valley.”\n\nUtah’s next earthquake could hit harder, U of U research suggests\n\nIn its new project, the UGS reportedly used federal funding from the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earthquake Hazards Program to remap active faults. They looked at faults that have ruptured the Earth’s surface in the past 2.6 million years and are capable of producing strong earthquakes.\n\nOlder mapping of these faults relied mainly on aerial photographs and fieldwork, the UGS said, missing “subtle or eroded fault scarps,” a step-like feature formed on the landscape by large earthquakes. Previous mapping was made even harder when these features were hidden by dense vegetation.\n\nIn their effort to produce better mapping of the region, geologists used Lidar — light detection and ranging — data to “significantly update the mapping and understanding of these faults,” the UGS said. Lidar reportedly allows geologists to digitally “see through” vegetation, exposing the earth underneath and revealing small or complex fault scarps previously hard to find.\n\n“Lidar data is a game-changer in the world of geomorphology and fault mapping due to our ability to map features on the surface of the earth, such as active faults, in much greater detail than ever before,” said Adam Hiscock, UGS Project Geologist.\n\nSeismologist breaks down 4.7 magnitude earthquake in Uinta Mountains, 6 aftershocks detected\n\nUsing the new mapping, geologists were able to point out zones where a detailed, site-specific investigation should be done prior to any new development in the area.\n\n“The UGS creates these maps to provide critical guidance for safe and smart community growth,” the release states. “UGS is tasked with helping our local governments, cities, towns, and planning commissions understand the risks below their feet when they imagine future development. Local authorities play the essential role of incorporating scientific data from the UGS into public safety and planning policy.”\n\nThe UGS outlined the following uses for the new mapping:\n\nInformed planning: Planning commissions can use the special-study zones to direct new development away from high-risk areas, thereby protecting new homes, schools, hospitals, and infrastructure like water lines and highways.\n\nRisk mitigation: By making development decisions based on the most accurate data available, cities and counties reduce future risks to life and property, ensuring a safer future for all Utahns.\n\nGuidance for local officials: Special-study zones are advisory areas where the UGS recommends that a detailed, site-specific investigation by a qualified geologist takes place prior to any new development.\n\nOrdinance enforcement: Local officials can use these maps to create and enforce geologic-hazard ordinances, ensuring that structures are not built directly on top of or too close to a known active fault trace.\n\nYou can access all the data from this UGS project here.

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A new report warns that the number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could hit 2 million by the spring, with Russia suffering the largest number of troop deaths recorded for any major power in any conflict since World War II.\n\nTuesday's report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nAs the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes hit an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\n“Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,” the report said. “No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\n\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\n\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side’s casualties.\n\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered “reliable information” and that only Russia’s Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\n\nThe ministry’s last statement on battlefield deaths was in September 2022, when it said that just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed. It has not released any updated figures since then.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\n\nThe report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\n\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington, D.C.-based think tank’s own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\n\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\n\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\n\nThe report also said that Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\n\nRussia’s advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say that Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army’s difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\n\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\n\nThat is “slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,” the report said.\n\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure — 617,000 — in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\n\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\n\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\n\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\n\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight. Twenty-four were shot down over Russia’s southwestern Krasnodar region, with 23 more shot down over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2016.\n\nTwo drones were reportedly shot down over Russia's Voronezh region, where Ukraine's General Staff said Wednesday that it had struck the Khokholskaya oil depot. Regional Gov. Alexander Gusev wrote on Telegram that falling drone debris sparked a fire involving oil products, but did not give further details.",

    "fullText": "With former quarterback Russell Wilson's contract fallout now finally off the books, Denver Broncos linebacker Alex Signleton has a funny contract request for the team's front office.\n\nSingleton, who is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent in March, was asked what he'd like to receive this spring.\n\n\"To be the richest player ever, right?\" Singleton said, via the Denver Post's Parker Gabriel. \"We have a lot of free Russell money, right? I’ll take $35 million a year.\"\n\nDenver ate $53 million worth of \"dead money\" in 2024 and another $32 million in 2025 after cutting Wilson. His contract will no longer count against the team's cap in 2026.\n\nSingleton, of course, was joking — and Denver's current projected to have about $35 million of total cap space this offseason. The veteran linebacker led the team with 135 tackles this season despite missing a game in November after undergoing surgery to remove testicular cancer.\n\nSingleton is now cancer-free, and he'd like to re-sign with the Broncos. He averaged about $6 million per year on his previous contract. Now 32 years old, Spotrac.com estimates Singleton has a market value of $4.7 million going into 2026.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL free agency: Alex Singleton's funny contract request for Broncos",

    "description": "Shedeur Sanders joins an elite group of Colorado Buffaloes to earn NFL Pro Bowl honors. Here’s every former Buff to make a Pro Bowl roster.",
    "fullText": "In light of Shedeur Sanders being added to the AFC Pro Bowl roster yesterday as a replacement quarterback, we decided to take a look at the other Colorado Buffaloes who have earned NFL Pro Bowl honors, either as original selections or alternates. Sanders becomes just the second quarterback in program history to make a Pro Bowl, joining Kordell Stewart, who was selected in 2001. He is also only the fourth Colorado player to be named to the Pro Bowl since 2010, alongside LT David Bakhtiari, RB Phillip Lindsay, and OL Andre Gurode.\n\nIn total, 19 Colorado Buffaloes have gone on to become NFL Pro Bowlers.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 12 games played, three interceptions for 13 return yards, 3 fumbles recovered (1959); 12 games played, one interception for 14 return yards (1960).\n\nBrookshier was a standout three-year letterman at the University of Colorado, excelling as a defensive back, fullback, and return specialist. He finished his career with six interceptions and led the nation in punt returns in 1951, averaging 12.0 yards per return.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, three interceptions for 41 return yards.\n\nDove was an exceptional running back and defensive back for the University of Colorado from 1956 to 1958. A key contributor in the single-wing offense, he rushed for more than 1,200 yards over his final two seasons and was selected in the third round of the 1959 NFL Draft.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Was one of the top guards in the NFL and helped Cleveland running backs Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly have historic seasons.\n\nWooten became just the fifth player in Colorado history to earn All-America honors and the first lineman to do so when he was recognized in 1958. A three-year letterman at guard from 1956 to 1958, he was named an All-American by the AFCA in his senior season, following a first-team All-Big Seven selection as a junior the year before.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, 44 receptions, 610 receiving yards, four touchdowns (1965); 14 games played, 54 receptions, 836 receiving yards, four touchdowns (1967).\n\nAlthough listed as a quarterback, Dowler was a versatile \"triple-threat\" in Dal Ward's single-wing offense. He caught 41 passes for 628 yards and six touchdowns, threw for 769 yards and seven scores, and averaged 43.6 yards per punt. On defense, he intercepted 10 passes, the second-most in school history at the time. A three-time All-Big Seven selection and honorable mention All-American in 1958, Dowler was later inducted into both the CU Athletic Hall of Fame and the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Three interceptions for 34 return yards, led the NFL with 5 fumble recoveries and scored one defensive touchdown (1972); Anderson had his peak year in 1973, leading the NFL with 8 interceptions for 163 yards and adding two pick-six touchdowns. In 1974, his numbers dipped, but he still earned Pro Bowl recognition, finishing with one interception for 14 yards.\n\nAnderson earned consensus All-American honors in 1967 and was known for his versatility on the field. He finished his college career with 14 interceptions and 266 tackles, setting school records at the time. In recognition of his outstanding achievements, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 14 games played, 51 catches, 983 receiving yards, nine touchdowns (1975); 14 games played, 46 catches, 1,111 receiving yards, 12 touchdowns (1976); 13 games played, 33 catches, 540 receiving yards, six touchdowns (1977); 16 games played, 49 catches, 709 receiving yards, one touchdown (1978).\n\nIn 22 games at Colorado, Branch caught 36 passes for 665 yards and 11 touchdowns while rushing 31 times for 354 yards and five scores, averaging 11.4 yards per carry. Renowned for his blazing speed, he recorded 11 plays of 59 yards or longer during his time in Boulder.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Played in 16 games and had eight interceptions and three touchdowns (1978). In 1989, he played 16 games, recording five interceptions and a touchdown.\n\nPerry earned All-Big Eight Conference honors and was named an honorable mention All-American in 1974. Known for his speed, he was a key contributor on defense for the Buffaloes before being selected in the 1975 NFL Draft.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Tackles were not officially recorded, but Johnson was a force and anchored the Eagles' defensive line during this three-year Pro Bowl stint.\n\nIn 1976, the Associated Press (AP) selected Johnson to the first-team All-Big Eight, and he was an honorable mention All-American. He received Colorado's Dave Jones award as the team's most valuable defensive lineman.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Nine games, one interception (shortened 1982 season); 15 games, three interceptions (1983); 15 games, seven interceptions, two fumble recoveries\n\nAt the time of his graduation, Haynes' 256 career tackles ranked second all-time for a defensive back at Colorado, and his 17 pass deflections were tied for seventh. Known for his speed, running a 4.4-second 40-yard dash, he made a lasting impact on the field and was later named a first-team member of CU's All-Century team in 1989.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 56 total tackles, 13 sacks, three forced fumbles and a fumble recovery\n\nWilliams won the 1990 Butkus Award and led the Buffs to a national championship. A two-time Big Eight Defensive Player of the Year, he finished as CU's all-time leader in sacks (35) and tackles for loss (59), later earning College Football Hall of Fame honors.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 16 games, 48 total tackles, one sack and one fumble recovery\n\nHe was second-team All-Conference as a sophomore, first-team all-Big Eight as a junior, and a second-team All-American selection as a senior. Steed ranks tied for 22nd on CU's all-time sacks list and 19th in tackles for a loss.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 81 tackles, 13.0 sacks, three forced fumbles, two interceptions (1996); 149 tackles, 7.5 sacks, one interception, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery (1998); 116 tackles, 5.5 sacks, six passes defended, two forced fumbles (1999)\n\nHe ended his career as Colorado's fourth all-time leading tackler with 369 stops, ranked third all-time in solo tackles with 242, and fourth in tackles for loss with 38. He played inside linebacker as a freshman and sophomore before moving to the outside, where he recorded 14 quarterback sacks over the next two seasons.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 60.2 percent completion rate, 3,109 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, 11 interceptions; 96 carries, 537 yards, five touchdowns\n\nStewart finished his career as Colorado's leader in both total offense and passing yards with 6,481, and through 2017, he still ranked second and fourth in those categories. His 27-5-1 record as a starter, an 83.3 winning percentage, remains the best in CU history for any quarterback. He was named first-team All-Big Eight as a senior in 1994 and received the Zack Jordan Award as the Buffs' most valuable player, leading Colorado to an 11-1 record and a number three national ranking.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Started 16 games, recorded 90 tackles, one interception, 12 passes defended and two forced fumbles\n\nAt Colorado, as a senior, he was a unanimous All-Big 12 Conference first-team choice, earned third-team All-America honors, and was a semi-finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back. He led the team with 112 tackles and five interceptions, one of which he returned for a touchdown. He also holds the school record with 6.5 career sacks for a defensive back.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 16 games started, average of 45.3 yards per punt, 66 total punts for 2,987 yards (1999);16 games started, 44.4 yards per punt, 81 total punts for 3,595 yards.\n\nBerger played three seasons at Colorado, where he served as the team's punter and kicker, contributing to the team before being drafted by the NFL in the sixth round.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Earned five consecutive Pro Bowl selections (2006-2010) as a center for the Dallas Cowboys. He served as a durable anchor on this offensive line, starting all 16 games in 2008, 2009 and 2010.\n\nAt Colorado, Gurode was a first-team All-Big 12 selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American as a senior in 2001. During his career, he allowed just 7.5 sacks in 2,653 plays as a starter for the Buffaloes.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 15 games, 1,037 rushing yards, nine touchdowns; 35 receptions for 241 yards and one touchdown\n\nLindsay became Colorado's all-time leader in all-purpose yards with 5,760 and yards from scrimmage with 4,683, totals that rise to 5,926 and 4,849, including the 2016 Alamo Bowl. He finished as the Buffs' second all-time leading rusher with 3,707 yards and was the first player in CU history to record back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons, and only the second to do so over any two seasons. With 110 receptions for 976 yards, he also set school records for the most catches and receiving yards by a running back. Lindsay became the 14th player to join CU's 500/500 Club for rushing and receiving yards, narrowly missing the milestone of 1,000 in both categories.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: Started 16 games, allowing only 4 sacks (2016); Started 16 games, earning his second-team All-Pro honors (2019); Started 12 games, allowing only one sack and one quarterback hit, with a 91.8 Pro Football Focus pass-blocking grade before a torn ACL (2020).\n\nA two-time second-team All-Pac 12 selection (2011, 2012) and a 2012 team captain, he was known for his durability and high-grade efficiency, allowing only two-and-a-half sacks in his final season.\n\nPro Bowl Season Stats: 8 games started, 1,400 passing yards, 8 total touchdowns, 10 interceptions\n\nSander finished his 24-start Colorado career 651-of-907 (71.8%) with 7,364 yards, 64 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions. He broke over 100 school records and finished third in passing yards, fifth in attempts, third in completions, first in passing touchdowns, and tops in QB rating.\n\nWith Shedeur Sanders earning his spot as a replacement, the hope is that Colorado can continue to produce more NFL talent and, more importantly, legitimate NFL stars. Entering the 2025 NFL season, 12 former Buffaloes were on active NFL rosters. Those are numbers Deion Sanders is clearly aiming to grow in 2026 and beyond.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Every Colorado football player to make an NFL Pro Bowl",

    "description": "The 2026 NBA trade deadline is Feb. 5. Phoenix Suns head coach Jordan Ott explains where his head is at before the deadline.",
    "fullText": "Jordan Ott’s primary focus as a first-year head coach has been on present, not the past or future.\n\nSo the way he first answered a question about the Feb. 5 trade deadline wasn’t surprising.\n\n“I’m trying to win a game tonight,” a smiling Ott said during pregame availability Jan. 27, as the Phoenix Suns (27-19) face the Brooklyn Nets (12-32) at Mortgage Matchup Center.\n\nThe Suns are seventh in the Western Conference and are playing above preseason predictions, but they’ve made trade deadline moves before under team owner Mat Ishbia starting with the blockbuster Kevin Durant deal in 2023.\n\nHowever, Ott said the Suns “love” the team currently constructed as they’re eyeing the return of Jalen Green moving forward.\n\nSuns coach Jordan Ott on Feb. 5 trade deadline: \"We have people in place in leadership to take care of a lot of that stuff. We know it's right around the corner, but we love our group. We continue to say that. Our group growing internally. Our big piece we're going to get back is… pic.twitter.com/X7MkHgKaMG\n\n— Duane Rankin (@DuaneRankin) January 28, 2026\n\n“We have people in place in leadership to take care of a lot of that stuff,” Ott said. \"We know it's right around the corner, but we love our group. We love our group. We continue to say that. Our group is growing internally. Our big piece we're going to get back is Jalen Green and that's what we're excited about.”\n\nPhoenix can’t trade any first-round picks through 2032. The Suns can move their 2033 first-round pick the night of the 2026 draft.\n\nGreen missed a second straight game after tweaking his right hamstring in the first quarter of Friday’s loss to the Atlanta Hawks to end six-game road trip.\n\nThat was Green’s second game back after missing 33 consecutive games with what the Suns called a right hamstring strain. He’s only played four games in his first season with the Suns, who acquired him from the Houston Rockets in the Kevin Durant trade.\n\nThe Suns had an MRI on Green after the Atlanta game that revealed no new damage. Green has had two workouts since with the latest one after Tuesday’s morning shootaround.\n\n“Everything seems to be good,” Ott said. “We'll continue to reassess. Get him back on the court when he's ready to go.\"\n\nOtt has said Green is day-to-day, adding Tuesday that Green doesn’t need to do 5-on-5 to return to the court. Green had multiple 5-on-5 runs with teammates, coaches and staff before returning Jan. 20 against Philadelphia during the six-game road trip after missing 33 consecutive games.\n\n“He had enough before he came back the last time,” Ott said. “It's more just, feel good. We're right there. It's nothing new. That was helpful. Just ease the mind. He's been out two months so some of that is expected. It's a new era for him, too. He's never had something like this. When he feels right, he'll be back out there. Dying to get back out there. We're dying to have him out there, but we want to have him right.\"\n\nGreen is averaging a career-low 11.8 points in his four games with the Suns.\n\nPhoenix is also down Devin Booker (right ankle sprain), Collin Gillespie (right hand sprain) and two-way player Isaiah Livers (illness).\n\nOtt said Gillespie hurt his hand when falling to the floor in Sunday’s loss to the Miami Heat and that it’s a “short-term” injury. Booker sprained his right ankle in the third quarter of the Atlanta loss. The Suns announced Sunday, Jan. 25, that Booker would be re-evaluated in a week.\n\nHave opinions about the current state of the Suns?

    "title": "3 Texas A&M matchups ranked in ESPN's top 100 games of the 2025 season",
    "description": "ESPN's Top 100 games during the 2025 season includes two memorable Texas A&M wins, while the CFP loss to Miami is ranked higher than expected.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2025 football season was a mixed bag for most of the fan base, but it was historic nonetheless, as second-year head coach Mike Elko and his veteran squad reeled off 11 consecutive wins, including road victories over Notre Dame, LSU, and Missouri.\n\nHowever, back-to-back losses to Texas in Austin and Miami in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the program's first postseason appearance was a major disappointment given the circumstances, the advantage of playing in Kyle Field, while starting quarterback Marcel Reed failed to connect on several throws that would have given the Aggies the lead.\n\nStill, the wind, which was even worse on the field, affected both teams, but thanks to a healthy running game, combined with Texas A&M's inability to stop the run late in the game, Miami running back Mark Fletcher racked up over 150 yards, leading to the Hurricanes finding the endzone, and ultimately winning the game 10-3. Yes, Miami made it all the way to the National Championship, but the Aggies had every chance to pull out the victory.\n\nCoupled with the insane comeback win over South Carolina, ESPN's Bill Connelly placed three of Texas A&M's memorable matchups on his top 100 games of the 2025 season, starting with the first-round playoff loss to Miami, which he surprisingly placed at No. 16, even though this was a slog fest before Miami's final drive in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Maybe the most aesthetically ... unique game of the season. Before Miami could make a run to the CFP championship game, the Hurricanes had to survive impossibly windy conditions (and a strong Texas A&M defense) in College Station. Carson Beck threw for only 103 yards, and the teams combined to miss four of six field goal attempts. Malachi Toney lost a key fourth-quarter fumble, but a 56-yard Mark Fletcher Jr. run set up Toney's redemption moment -- an 11-yard jet sweep TD with 1:44 left. Texas A&M rallied, driving 70 yards in just 1:20, but Bryce Fitzgerald picked off a third-and-goal pass in the end zone, and Miami advanced.\"\n\nComing in at No. 11, Texas A&M's 31-30 win over South Carolina did not end up being the catalyst many of us thought it would be, but it will be remembered as one of the greatest comebacks of all time, regardless of how the season finished out. Trailing 30-3 at the half, the Aggies went from playing their worst football of the year to looking like an unstoppable force on both sides of the ball.\n\n\"It was the biggest comeback in Texas A&M history, without which the Aggies probably wouldn't have made the playoff. It was also a day that featured both the worst and best halves of Marcel Reed's career. In the first half, he completed only 6 of 19 passes with two terrible interceptions and two sacks, one of which produced a fumble returned for a score by Nick Barrett. LaNorris Sellers threw a 50-yard touchdown to Vandrevius Jacobs and an 80-yarder to Nyck Harbor (complete with a really strange interaction with a state trooper), and the Gamecocks cruised into halftime up 30-3.\n\nIn the second half, A&M woke up, and the Gamecocks clammed up. Reed went 16-for-20 for 298 yards and three third-quarter touchdowns -- 27 yards to Izaiah Williams, 39 to Ashton Bethel-Roman, 14 to Nate Boerkircher -- and the Aggies gained 371 yards while allowing 76. They needed only 20 minutes to take a 31-30 lead, and South Carolina could never mount a rally. It was the most strangely straightforward 27-point comeback you'll ever see.\"\n\nLastly, at No. 4, Texas A&M's most important win of the season was going on the road in Week 3 against a 0-1 Notre Dame team that had lost a close road battle against Miami the week prior.\n\nHaving not won a ranked non-conference road game in over 40 years, a botched snap on an extra point, paired with Marcel Reed driving the Aggies down the field, finding tight end Nate Boerkircher for the game-tying touchdown, was by far the most exciting moment of the 2025 season outside of Indiana winning its first national title.\n\n\"A botched PAT snap and hold might have made the difference in a playoff bid. Texas A&M led 28-24 after a wild first half, and after a reasonably tame third quarter, the action picked up again late. With the score tied at 34-34, Jeremiyah Love capped a 12-play, six-minute drive with a 12-yard touchdown, but a botched hold on the PAT left the Irish's lead at just six points. A third-down scramble from Marcel Reed and a defensive holding penalty gave A&M a first-and-goal, but that quickly became fourth-and-goal from the 11. No worries -- with 19 seconds left, Reed found Nate Boerkircher for the game-winner. (Well, I guess Randy Bond's PAT was the actual game winner, but still.)\"\n\nTexas A&M will open the 2026 season against Missouri State on Saturday, September 5.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions.

His stay in South Bend was a short one, after joining the program just under a year ago.\n\nThere another reunion of for Spalding in East Lansing, as he’ll rejoin former Irish linebackers coach Max Bullough, who left earlier this offseason to become the Spartans co-defensive coordinator. This is somewhat of a loss, as it’s never good to lose an rising young coach, but like with Mickens leaving, you have to trust that head coach Marcus Freeman will find a more than suitable replacement.\n\nNotre Dame assistant WRs coach Dom Spalding has followed his brother, Devon, to join the Michigan State Spartans staff.

With free agency approaching, many have speculated about Ravens free agents who could follow their former head coach to New York.\n\nThere may also be interest in targeting free agents who previously played for both the Giants and Harbaugh, such as Kevin Zeitler, Jihad Ward, or even former star receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nWFAN's Tommy Lugauer believes a reunion with Beckham is something the Giants should explore.\n\nTommy calls for the Giants to bring back Odell Beckham Jr:@tommylugauer pic.twitter.com/i9TRz55iBu\n\n— WFAN Sports Radio (@WFAN660) January 27, 2026\n\n\"So here's my suggestion. A wide receiver that is no stranger to the Giants, a wide receiver that is no stranger to John Harbaugh. A wide receiver that has already had a conversation with Jaxson Dart about John Harbaugh,\" he said. \"And that man's name is Odell Beckham Jr. That's right. OBJ reuniting in New York in a different role than he had in his previous stop, where he was the number one wide receiver, the playmaker. Now as a grizzled vet, a guy that's won a championship, has been around the block -- a chance to come back home.\n\n\"A chance to reunite not only with the Giants but with John Harbaugh, and be a valued wide receiver and playmaker for young Jaxson Dart and a young Giants offense. So there's already a relationship with Harbaugh and OBJ. There's obviously a relationship with Beckham and the Giants. Many were sad when he was sent away, when he was traded off. Now here's the opportunity for the reunion. So Joe Schoen, John Harbaugh -- make it happen. Odell Beckham Jr. back with the Giants.\"\n\nA Beckham-Giants reunion has been discussed for years following the trade that sent the former first-round pick to the Cleveland Browns. Beckham was one of the franchise's most popular players in recent memory, and he has certainly shown interest in returning to the Giants before his career ends.\n\nAs much fun as the reunion may be, it is certainly questionable how much production Beckham could add as a playmaker at 33 years old.\n\nHe last played in 2024 with the Miami Dolphins, appearing in nine games and hauling in just nine catches for 55 yards. Beckham also played for Harbaugh and the Ravens in 2023, when he racked up over 500 yards and three touchdowns on 35 receptions.\n\nWith the Giants relying heavily on the return of Malik Nabers and many questions surrounding the wide receiver corps beyond him, Beckham could provide veteran leadership for his fellow LSU alumnus to learn from and someone the young receivers can lean on during Nabers' recovery from injury.\n\nBeckham, of course, also suffered a pair of ACL tears in his post-Giants career, including one in Super Bowl LVI, where he scored the game's first touchdown, helping the Rams secure the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nBeckham has previously expressed interest in continuing his career, and finishing it in a Giants uniform could be just what he needs. However, it would have to make sense for the Giants, who would need to feel confident in Beckham's ability to help the team at this stage of his career.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Should New York Giants reunite Odell Beckham Jr. with John Harbaugh?",

    "description": "Mikel Arteta has denied that Martin Odegaard’s role as Arsenal’s captain is at risk, despite the midfielder playing a little bit less in recent weeks.Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesArsenal��...",
    "fullText": "Arsenal’s last three games have been a little unusual, in that Martin Odegaard has been fit to play in all three, but he hasn’t completed more than an hour in any of them.\n\nThe Gunners captain came off before the hour mark against Nottingham Forest, before sitting on the bench for the entirety of Arsenal’s trip to Inter Milan. He returned to the starting lineup against Manchester United, but again came off before 60 minutes.\n\nEven in the two games prior to this run, Odegaard only completed 68 minutes against Chelsea and 21 against Portsmouth. You have to go back to 2025 to find the Norway international’s last full 90.\n\nThe run raises some questions about the 27-year-old, and whether Mikel Arteta still considers him a key player in vital moments. But when asked whether Odegaard’s role as captain could be at risk on Tuesday, Arteta was emphatic.\n\n“No,” Arteta responded. “The minutes [he plays] as well are related because obviously he had two shoulder injuries and he was out for six weeks with a knee injury as well.\n\n“We have the possibility to change games and the games maybe require something different and every player is very important to be able to achieve that.”\n\nIt’s true that Odegaard has struggled with injuries this season, picking up three different injuries in his first three Premier League appearances at the Emirates Stadium in 2025/26.\n\nIn all, the former Real Madrid man has missed 11 matches, as well as most of the three in which he had to come off injured.\n\nThat’s quite a significant portion of the campaign, especially for someone who missed less than 10 games injured in his first three and a half seasons with the club.\n\nBut Arsenal need their captain to find some consistency now, as the club approach the business end of the season.",

    "description": "Virginia nearly blew a game against 11-10 Notre Dame but State is making progress",
    "fullText": "Tuesday’s ACC Action went about as we expected, but it was a close-run thing. NC State and Virginia Tech won, as expected, but Wake Forest was knocked off by Pitt and Notre Dame took Virginia to double-overtime before falling just short.\n\nNC State added to Syracuse’s misery, winning 88-68. The Pack shot 51% to 39% for the Orange. State dominated the boards too, 45-33. Donnie Freeman was the brightest spot for the ‘Cuse with 24 points and 10 rebounds. JJ Starling had 17 points.\n\nDarrion Williams had 23 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists for State. Ven-Allen Lubin racked up 18 and 9 while former Syracuse player Quadir Copeland had 19 points, 9 assists and 4 steals against his old team.\n\nAdrian Autry was already getting some heat coming into this one and a 20-point loss where his team didn’t really defend won’t help.\n\nYou have to feel for the Irish. Notre Dame was up 19 on a really good Virginia team but gave it all up and the game went to double OT where the ‘Hoos won, 100-97.\n\nAll of Notre Dame’s big men fouled out, basically trying to guard Thijs De Ridder, who hit 14-15 from the line. He finished with 32 points and 8 rebounds.\n\nSam Lewis had 21 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists and impressive freshman Chance Mallory ended up with 17 points.\n\nThe way this game is being framed is that Notre Dame blew it but that’s not really fair. The Irish played way over their head and simply couldn’t sustain it, as the foul situation indicates. It was a game effort and deserves respect, not mockery. Better question: what’s going on with Virginia? They couldn’t keep up with UNC and it took two OTs to beat a team that is missing their best player and that couldn’t defend against them inside. What’s up with the ‘Hoos?\n\nLike Virginia, Pitt fell behind early and came back to in in overtime, 80-76. As noted previously, Wake’s inside woes are tough to overcome. Cooper Schwieger had 7 points but did grab 11 boards, Tre’Von Spillers had 8 points and 3 boards and Omaha Biliew had 1 point and 1 board.\n\nThe perimeter carried the day, again. Juke Harris had 17 points and 5 boards, Myles Colvin had 18 and Nate Calmese finished with 10.\n\nYou can win with minimal front court production, but your backcourt has to be really good, a la Georgia Tech’s Lethal Weapon 3 offense of Kenny Anderson, Dennis Scott and Brian Oliver. Wake’s is good but not that good, plus Tech had Matt Geiger and Malcolm Mackey, solid if unspectacular bigs.\n\nRoman Siulepa continues to improve and finished with 15 points and 15 rebounds but Omari Witherspoon was the hero of the day. In overtime, he got a key steal, deflected a three and then hit a clutch three of his own with 15 seconds left. Great effort by the freshman.\n\nBoth teams had lost three straight. Pitt is 9-12 and Wake is barely over .500 at 11-10.\n\nVirginia Tech cleaned up on threes and at the line in a 71-65 win over the Yellow Jackets. The Hokies outscored Georgia Tech 24-6 on threes and won free throws 19-12.\n\nTobi Lawal is back in the starting lineup for Virginia Tech and their lineup now is pretty impressive: Lawal, Amani Hansberry who has really excelled, Neoklis Avdalas, who has certainly had his moments, Jailen Bedford and Ben Hammonds, who finished with 20 here.\n\nGeorgia Tech made a nice comeback but it wasn’t quite enough to pull off the upset.\n\nWith the win, Virginia Tech is 16-6 and an NCAA bid is certainly on the table if they continue to play well.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Florida schools make the West Coast swing.

    "fullText": "The door has opened for Liverpool to finally replace Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nLet's be honest, the Reds are missing their former no.66. Obviously, the club's massive plight this season is not solely down to Alexander-Arnold's departure.\n\nHowever, some of the struggles in build-up and creativity have been directly impacted by his lack of presence in the team and therefore the lack of players with the technical nous and ability to do what Alexander-Arnold did best.\n\nAt the same time, it's also important to note that we have discovered throughout the season that Arne Slot does not necessarily deem Jeremie Frimpong as a right-back.\n\nIn fact he's often played him as a right-winger instead. Sometimes Dominik Szoboszlai has started ahead of Frimpong at right-back.\n\nSo, the reality is that Liverpool have not even replaced Alexander-Arnold with a right-back. Meanwhile, Conor Bradley suffered an injury that means he's out for the rest of the season.\n\nIt means that looking ahead to next season, Liverpool are likely going to have to bring in more reinforcements and address the right-back question.\n\nHow they plan on doing that hinges on many things.\n\nBut the likeliest way is by entering the market and signing an actual right-back this summer. And the player they seem to be targeting according to Florian Plettenberg as per TEAMtalk is Givairo Read.\n\nThe report claims that Bayern Munich and Liverpool are both very interested in the Feyenoord right-back, but the former is currently focusing on several costly contract extensions which means the door is open for Richard Hughes to pounce and secure a deal for the talented right-back before anyone else.\n\nWhat makes Read such an intriguing profile is that he is only 19-years-old but already has a lot of experience under his belt.",

    "fullText": "Brooks Koepka is the story in the world of golf right now, with the American set to make his return to the PGA Tour on Thursday.\n\nIt was only two weeks ago when Koepka was reinstated as a PGA Tour member, after he moved on from LIV Golf on December 23rd.\n\nThe five-time major champion is the first player to jump ship from LIV and return immediately to the PGA Tour.\n\nKoepka managed to win a major during his time with LIV but in general, his form at the four biggest events in the game was nowhere near good enough.\n\nThe highlight of that stretch came at Augusta National, where he finished second in the Masters. Still, it’s a long way back from that peak.\n\nPGA Tour boss Jay Monahan welcomed him back ahead of this week’s start at Torrey Pines. “We are excited for Brooks’ return,” Monahan said. “I know he wants to be here.”\n\nKoepka has never been one to shy away from giving an honest answer. So when the 35-year-old was asked if there’s anything he misses about LIV Golf, his response felt genuine.\n\n“I think maybe just being around the guys, right, because we’re not — everybody’s not around each other all the time,” Koepka said.\n\n“I think sometimes, I mean we were all one big traveling circus, right? That’s kind of what it is. It’s fun and I’m going to miss some of those guys, seeing those guys pretty much week to week out there. The relationships I’ve built with those guys and not seeing them all the time, that will be quite different.”\n\nNow back on the PGA Tour, Koepka will have a chance to reconnect with familiar faces and get to know some of the newer names making their mark in the sport.\n\nDuring his media availability on Tuesday, Koepka was asked what he missed most about the PGA Tour while playing for LIV Golf.\n\n“That’s a good question. I think the ability to have my family out all the time. I think that was one thing because they didn’t travel too much over the last few years.”\n\n“But like they’re going to be out this week, so I am super excited to be able to have them out.“\n\nThe transition back to regular life on the PGA Tour should help with that. It also puts him back in front of some of golf’s toughest competition, something he also seemed to miss during his time with LIV.\n\nThe question now is whether Koepka can still measure up against golf’s elite after his time away. The Farmers Insurance Open this week will give us an early look at how well he adapts back into the fold and whether he can hit the ground running.",

    "fullText": "Despite recent setbacks in the Champions League, Cristian Chivu has no doubts about the work he's doing. The former Inter professional, who took over from Simone Inzaghi in the summer, believes his team are on the right track in both Serie A and Europe. “My team have grown mentally over the past two months – they are playing with more conviction and ambition,” said the Romanian. “Ups and downs are part of any development.” Despite his great respect for the difficult task ahead, his anticipation prevails: “We know it’s not easy to play here. There’s a lot of energy in this stadium. Dortmund rarely lose at home. But even they have their problems sometimes.”\n\nDefender Yann Bisseck expressed similar optimism. The Cologne-born Germany international continues to believe in a conciliatory end to the first half of the season – including a possible jump back into the top eight teams. “BVB are very strong and reached the Champions League final in 2024. In this atmosphere, it’s crucial to keep a cool head,” said Bisseck. He is not intimidated by the Yellow Wall: “We’re not afraid. We also play at San Siro, which is a special stadium.”\n\nLike Borussia, who dropped from sixth to 16th place after a 2-2 draw with Bodø/Glimt and a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and go into the last matchday of the league phase with 11 points, Inter Milan were also unable to defend a good starting position (see facts). Victories over Ajax (2-0), Slavia Prague (3-0), Union Saint-Gilloise (4-0) and Kairat Almaty (2-1) had put the Nerazzurri in third place early on and fuelled hopes of early direct qualification for the round of 16, which is only guaranteed for the top eight teams.\n\nThis prospect is now only realistic with the help of other clubs. For the first time in the club's history, Inter failed to pick up any points in three consecutive Champions League matches – against Atlético Madrid (2-1), Liverpool (1-0) and Arsenal (3-1). As a result, they have fallen to 14th place. The away game in Dortmund is their fourth attempt to get points on the board against a major European rival.\n\nAt least the 20-time Italian champions, who will be without the injured EURO 2020 winner Nicolo Barella, are not in danger of being eliminated prematurely. With 12 points, they are guaranteed a place in the play-offs even if they lose. The teams ranked 9th to 24th will play home and away matches for the remaining places in the round of 16. With only one point separating them from sixth to eighth place, Inter could avoid this additional round by winning in Dortmund.\n\nChivu's team are performing very differently in Serie A. Ten games without defeat have put Inter at the top of the table, five points ahead of city rivals AC Milan. Even a 0-2 deficit had no consequences in the recent 6-2 win against bottom-of-the-table Pisa. Nevertheless, there is a parallel to their European record at national level: they have only managed one win against their direct rivals AC Milan, Roma, Napoli and Juventus.\n\nInter are taking heart from their positive history against BVB. The two clubs met in the semi-finals of the 1963/64 European Cup, the quarter-finals of the 1993/94 UEFA Cup and the group stage of the 2019/20 Champions League. With three wins, one draw and two defeats, Inter have a slight edge in the head-to-head record.\n\nThe club, founded in 1908, also has the edge in terms of European titles. After successes in the European Cup in 1964 and 1965, Inter won the Champions League for the third time in 2010 with a 2-0 victory over Bayern Munich. They also have three UEFA Cup triumphs to their name (1991, 1994, 1998). Further title chances have recently gone unused: in 2023, Inter lost to Manchester City (1-0) in the Champions League final and in 2025 to Paris Saint-Germain (5-0).\n\nBVB coach Niko Kovac paid great respect to the current Italian league leaders, whose squad includes two former Dortmund players, Manuel Akanji and Henrikh Mkhitaryan: “We are playing against a really strong team that has been in the final twice in the last three years. It’s anything but easy. Balance will be crucial – we mustn’t be naive” (see preview).",

    "fullText": "Liverpool are just one win away from booking a place in the Champions League last 16 as they welcome Qarabag FK to Anfield for Wednesday’s league-phase finale.\n\nDespite going through a frustrating Premier League campaign, Europe has continued to offer a sense of comfort for Arne Slot’s side, who remain firmly in control of their own fate.\n\nThe Reds arrive on the back of a convincing 3-0 win away to Ligue 1 giants Olympique Marseille.\n\nLiverpool were expected to be tested by Roberto De Zerbi’s attack-minded team, but instead delivered a classic Champions League performance to see off the French powerhouse.\n\nGoals from Dominik Szoboszlai and Cody Gakpo on either side of an unfortunate Geronimo Rulli own goal helped the Reds see out a comfortable victory.\n\nThe win against Marseille was Liverpool’s fourth success from their last five Champions League games.\n\nThey’ll now head into the group phase finale in fourth place, two points clear of ninth-placed Barcelona and 13th-placed Atalanta.\n\nA win against Qarabag will allow them to skip the play-off round and move straight into the last 16.\n\nLiverpool are heading into this contest as overwhelming favourites, given the massive difference in quality between the two teams.\n\nTo further bolster their chances, Anfield has been a fortress in the Champions League.\n\nBefore their heavy 4-1 defeat to PSV Eindhoven, Liverpool had won 16 consecutive Champions League home games in the league or group phase.\n\nThe pummelling at the hands of PSV also represents one of just three defeats from their last 20 Champions League games at this stage.\n\nHaving failed to capitalise on that huge Marseille win on their return to domestic duties, Slot will hope a much-changed XI can get his side back to winning ways against one of the competition’s underdogs.\n\nAlisson will likely retain his place in goal, but there could be changes across other areas of the pitch.\n\nWataru Endo and Andrew Robertson, who has been linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur, should join the backline alongside Virgil van Dijk and Jeremie Frimpong.\n\nCurtis Jones and Ryan Gravenberch may be tasked with anchoring the midfield, although Slot may decide to rest the latter and replace him with academy talent Trey Nyoni.\n\nRio Ngumoha could also be handed a rare start in attack alongside Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo, while Hugo Ekitike leads the line.",

    "description": "The Pro Football Hall of Fame took a huge hit of credibility by excluding Bill Belichick. Should we even care about it anymore?",
    "fullText": "In about a week, the Pro Football Hall of Fame class of 2026 will be revealed. However, the biggest news to come out of that class already was revealed on Tuesday afternoon. Per a report from ESPN, legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick will somehow not be part of the class in his first year of eligibility. The reason appears to be that some Hall of Fame voters believed Belichick deserved punishment for the several cheating allegations during his tenure with the Patriots, notably spygate and deflategate.\n\nObviously, this news has drawn a massive amount of criticism toward the Hall of Fame, with some alleging that they will never recover from such a massive blunder. It’s a rare moment in which nearly all of the internet seems to agree that this was a ridiculous mistake, which only makes this news even more confounding. How could at least 10 of 50 voters believe Belichick wasn’t worth of first-ballot Hall of Fame status when nearly the entire internet agrees?\n\nThat leads to today’s Question of the Day:\n\nMy answer: A little, but not much.\n\nPersonally, I don’t love the idea of comparing greatness. Greatness is greatness, and the gatekeeping of who deserves the extra special designation of Hall of Famer or first-ballot Hall of Famer is missing the point of this game. Everyone who plays it hold a special place in this game’s history, and because it’s more so a team sport than just about any other one means that even some of the lesser-known players can do amazing things. Think of guys like David Tyree, who will never be a Hall of Famer, but will always be synonymous with one of the most important plays in Super Bowl history.\n\nI also think the Hall of Fame leads to unnecessary and sometimes disrespectful debates about the GOAT. We debate resumés of people who played in completely different eras, and try to downplay the accomplishments of others in order to raise up our guy. I think a lot about this Kobe Bryant tweet about the NBA GOAT whenever these conversations are brought up:\n\nWe can enjoy one without tearing down one. I love what he’s doing. Don’t debate what can’t be definitively won by anyone #enjoymy5 #enjoymj6 #enjoylbjquest\n\n— Kobe Bryant (@kobebryant) May 28, 2018\n\nThe Belichick development is just further proof that this gatekeeping of greatness is flawed, petty, and, ultimately, a waste of time.\n\nThat said, I do like the idea of honoring and preserving this game’s history. Having a literal, physical place where you can go and learn about this league’s greatest moments and best players is important to me. And I will admit those videos of players getting notified they’re entering the Hall of Fame get me everytime.\n\nStill, the bickering over greatness is just off-putting to me, and I wish there were ways we could celebrate these players without making it feel so exclusive.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about the Hall of Fame and the Belichick incident?

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos have acted quickly following their defeat to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game.\n\nThey have now made a major coaching decision that underlines how high expectations remain inside the organisation.\n\nDespite coming within one win of the Super Bowl, head coach Sean Payton made it clear that difficult calls were unavoidable.\n\nPayton addressed the changes publicly, offering a measured response that balanced appreciation with the reality of the NFL.\n\nJoe Lombardi has been dismissed from his role as offensive coordinator just days after the Broncos’ AFC Championship loss.\n\nThe decision brings an end to a long working relationship between Payton and Lombardi.\n\n“I want to thank these coaches for playing an important role in elevating our program over the last three seasons,” Payton said.\n\n“I’ve been fortunate to work with Joe Lombardi for 15 years and am particularly grateful for his many contributions to our success as offensive coordinator.”\n\nThe comments underscore Payton’s respect for Lombardi, even as the Broncos choose to move in a different direction.\n\nThey also reflect how fine the margins are at the top level, where progress alone does not guarantee continuity.\n\nLombardi was not the only departure announced, with wide receivers coach Keary Colbert and cornerbacks coach Addison Lynch also leaving the team.\n\nWith Lombardi gone, attention has already turned to who might step into a more prominent role within the offense.\n\nPassing game coordinator Davis Webb is expected to be a potential internal candidate for promotion as the Broncos assess their next move.\n\nWebb has received head coaching interest from around the league, which has only strengthened his standing within the organization.\n\nThat growing reputation could make continuity appealing as Payton looks to build on a season that still ended one step short.\n\nWhether Denver opts for an internal promotion or looks outside the building, the message from Payton is clear.\n\nAfter falling short in the AFC Championship game, change is seen as necessary to push the Broncos to the next level.",

    "description": "Here's why Belichick didn't make the Hall of Fame yet.",
    "fullText": "Why Bill Belichick isn't a first-ballot Hall of Famer after controversial vote: 'Six Super Bowls isn't enough?' originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBill Belichick is one of the winningest coaches in NFL history and the only head coach with six Super Bowl wins, but that isn't enough to make the Hall of Fame yet.\n\nIn his first year of eligibility, the former New England Patriots coach was not elected to Canton, as he did not reach the 40 votes necessary to earn an election. Belichick will remain on the ballot moving forward, but he will not be part of a prestigious group to earn a first-ballot election.\n\nBelichick's NFL coaching career ended on a sour note, but he still has 302 regular season wins, third most all-time, and 31 playoff wins, which is the most all-time. Belichick's six Super Bowls are two more than second place, and his nine Super Bowl appearances are three more than second place.\n\nHere's why Belichick didn't make the Hall of Fame yet.\n\nMORE: Ranking the best Patriots of all time\n\nAccording to ESPN, Belichick didn't get enough votes necessary to make the Hall of Fame due to his baggage in the NFL. ESPN reports that Belichick's roles in both Spygate and Deflategate kept him out on first try, as some voters may think Belichick should wait at least a year as some sort of punishment.\n\n\"The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff,\" a veteran Hall voter said, via ESPN. \"It really bothered some of the guys.\"\n\nAdditionally, the voting process for coaches is different than the process for players. Belichick is one of five owners, executives, coaches and players competing for up to three available spots separate from teh 15 modern-era finalists, forcing each voter to pick three of those five.\n\nAlong with Belichick, the other four finalists include Patriots owner Robert Kraft, former quarterback Ken Anderson, former running back Roger Craig and former defensive end L.C. Greenwood.\n\nESPN writer and Hall of Fame voter Mike Sando explained the difficult process of voting for these players, saying that they have an extremely high bar to clear.\n\nI'm a HOF voter who saw Belichick as slam-dunk. I don't know anything about voting results, but if this is true, and we'll find out officially next week, the question is, how could this happen?\n\nBefore I list possibilities, understand this:\n\nBelichick, Kraft, Craig, Anderson &… https://t.co/V8okBDsReH\n\n— Mike Sando (@SandoNFL) January 27, 2026\n\nMORE: Who is on the Mount Rushmore of Boston sports?\n\n\"Spygate\" was a Patriots cheating scandal from the 2007 season. Then-New York Jets head coach, and former Patriots assistant, Eric Mangini tipped off the NFL to the Patriots illegally videotaping Jets' defensive signals on the sidelines.\n\nThe NFL ultimately fined Belichick $500,000, the Patriots $250,000, and forced New England to forfeit its 2008 first-round pick.\n\nMORE: What was Bill Belichick's record without Tom Brady\n\nWhen Belichick found out he did not make the Hall of Fame, the veteran coach was understandably upset. ESPN reports that Belichick was \"puzzled\" and \"disappointed\" by his omission from the Hall this year, as he believes he was left out due to \"politics\"instead of accomplishments.\n\n\"Six Super Bowls isn't enough?\" Belichick reportedly asked an associate. \"What does a guy have to do?\"\n\nMORE: The 10 longest-tenured coaches in NFL history\n\nHere are the hall-of-fame coaches who were elected to the Hall on first ballot.\n\nBoth Halas and Lambeau were elected to the Hall of Fame as part of the first ever induction class, so they weren't first-ballot in the same way the other three were. Shula is the all-time wins leader, while he, Landry and Noll have a combined eight Super Bowl titles and 15 Super Bowl appearances.\n\nMORE: Breaking down the worst losses of Bill Belichick's career\n\nThere are 50 Hall of Fame voters that comprise of NFL writers and a media members. Among the voters are foremr Indianapolis Colts GM Bill Polian, who works for SiriusXM NFL radio and reportedly believes Belichick should wait a year to be inducted.\n\nThe full list of NFL Hall of Fame voters can be found here.\n\nBill Belichick has six Super Bowl victories, which is the most all-time among NFL coaches. Only Tom Brady has more Super Bowls as a player, and six of his seven came with Belichick as his head coach.\n\nBill Belichick is 73 years old, but is still coaching as he is about to enter his second season as North Carolina's head coach.",

    "title": "Micah's takeaways from Sam Darnold and Seahawks' NFC title game win",
    "description": "With Sam Darnold showing he can play elite football in big moments, there is no reason left to doubt the Seattle Seahawks",
    "fullText": "For the Seahawks to punch their ticket to the Super Bowl, it took everyone being at their best, but most importantly, they needed their quarterback, Sam Darnold, to lead the way. That is exactly what he did, as he delivered the best performance of his career. Many other Seahawks stars stepped up, but this time, Sam Darnold led the way to victory.\n\nHere are my takeaways from the Seahawks' big win to send them to the Super Bowl:\n\nIn a game where Darnold needed to be at his best, he was. Matthew Stafford was his usual elite self, and he had no problem vs the Seahawks elite defense. Sam Darnold needed to match that and deliver his best game. Darnold did that, all while not throwing any turnover-worthy throws. This game displayed the best version of Darnold. He was confident, he made all the throws he needed to make, and he was good for all 4 quarters of this game. He was the MVP in this one, and many thought it would be another game where he was seeing ghosts; it was the complete opposite. The one roadblock for this team was going to be whether or not Darnold can be great, and now that he has, all that is left is to win a game that they will be favored by a decent margin. Such a huge moment for Sam Darnold and a great turning point for his career.\n\nJaxon Smith-Njigba was dominant vs the Rams, and there was not a single thing the Rams' corners could do to stop him. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 10 catches for 153 yards and a touchdown. The field had multiple great receivers on it, but it was Jaxon Smith-Njigba who looked like the most elite one. His elite route running was on full display, and his technical precision makes him a nightmare for anyone guarding him. It felt very easy any time he and Darnold connected. That should be a duo that has a lot of success the next few years together in Seattle. Moving on from DK Metcalf had to be done, but many did not expect Jaxon Smith-Njigba to emerge as that guy so quickly. He has shown truly what a number 1 receiver really looks like. After this great performance and most likely another one in the Superbowl he should enter next season in the best receiver in the league conversations.\n\nKlint Kubiak, this season, helped Sam Darnold pick up right where he left off in Minnesota this season. Darnold was elite once again, but this offense this season was very well-rounded. In 2024-25, the Seahawks could not run the ball. This season, both Zach Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker ran for over 700 yards. Kenneth Walker looks like a top back in the league once again. Jaxon Smith-Njigba looks like the best receiver in the NFL, and he led the NFL in receiving yards with nearly 1800 on the season. That all happens because of how good Klint Kubiak called this offense. He put everyone in the best position possible to have great years. The Seahawks offense, as a result of that, was a top ten unit all across the board. The defense gets a bit of the spotlight for this team, but it was the offense that won the game vs the Rams on Sunday.\n\nThe most successful defensive head coach in recent memory has been Bill Belichick. People tend to believe you cannot win with a coach that is a defensive mind. The league has changed to benefit the offensive side of the ball, and the most successful coaches tend to be offensive-oriented. That has changed this season as Mike Macdonald has cultivated a nightmare defense and has changed the culture completely in Seattle. The defense he has built in Seattle has carried this team a long way, and he is not getting outcoached by the best offensive minds in the league. He is winning those battles. Mike Macdonald, most importantly, has proven he can get it right with hiring the best offensive coordinator possible, and Klint Kubiak was a home run. Macdonald has taken his squad to the Super Bowl in his second season as head coach, all while being in the toughest division in the NFL, quite an impressive feat for a defensive coach.\n\nThe winner of the NFC Championship game was ultimately going to be at the very least the favorite to win it all. The Patriots, while demonstrating an elite defense, have given many reasons to be concerned that they can put up enough points to win against Seattle or the Rams. Sam Darnold got the monkey off his back and now this team has nothing left to hold them back. The Seahawks were the most complete football team this entire season, and I think they show it on February 8th by blowing out the Patriots. Sam Darnold will be the first Trojan to start in and win a Super Bowl.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Key reasons for Seattle Seahawks' NFC championship win over Rams",

    "fullText": "If you’ve ever complained that the U.S. treats the World Baseball Classic like extended spring training, congratulations: Team USA appears to have heard you. The early commitments for 2026 look like a cheat code – power, speed, and (finally) pitching that isn’t just guys who answered the phone.\n\nStart with the face of the team: Aaron Judge isn’t just participating – he’s Team USA’s captain. And that’s not a ceremonial title, it’s a signal that this run is serious. Mark DeRosa is back as manager, and MLB’s Michael Hill is the GM, plus the coaching staff has legit teeth – Skip Schumaker, Andy Pettitte, Matt Holliday, David Ross, and more.\n\nThe bats are obnoxious, in the best way, of course. Judge is joined by Bryce Harper at first base, Bobby Witt Jr. and Gunnar Henderson up the middle, Alex Bregman on the dirt, plus Will Smith behind the plate, and Kyle Schwarber (DH) to launch nukes. Toss in Corbin Carroll’s rocket wheels, Byron Buxton’s ceiling, and Pete Crow-Armstrong’s glove-and-guts energy, and this lineup can win pretty, win ugly, and win loud.\n\nNow the scary part: pitching. Team USA already has Paul Skenes and Tarik Skubal, and MLB.com points out that means the U.S. can roll out both 2025 Cy Young winners. Add Logan Webb for innings and steady, Clayton Kershaw for the big-game aura, and Mason Miller for 101-mph late-inning violence, and you’ve got a staff that looks built to dominate.\n\nAnd yes, the road map helps. Pool B is in Houston at Daikin Park (Brazil, Great Britain, Mexico, Italy), quarterfinals are back in Houston, and the semifinals and final are in Miami. Translation: Team USA gets a home-field runway – if it handles business early.\n\nWhy the urgency? Because the U.S. won the Classic in 2017, it then had to settle for silver in 2023. This roster is built to win it all again, and it’s doing it the right way: depth, velocity, and star power.\n\nIs it already the best Team USA WBC roster ever? Absolutely. And the most dangerous part is what’s still possible: final rosters aren’t even out yet – meaning the best ever conversation isn’t just smoke.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings, 30 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nNHL: NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl 60 graphic resurfaces\n\nWWE: WWE Power Rankings ahead of Royal Rumble\n\nThe post Team USA’s 2026 WBC roster could be the best baseball team ever  appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "The layoffs mark the second round of mass cuts at Amazon since last October, when the company laid off roughly 14,000 employees across its corporate workforce.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said Wednesday it plans to eliminate about 16,000 corporate jobs, marking its second round of mass job cuts since last October.\n\nIn a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs were part of an ongoing effort to \"strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy.\" That coincides with a push to invest heavily in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe cuts come just a few months after October's layoffs, when 14,000 employees were let go across Amazon's corporate workforce. At the time, the company indicated the cuts would continue in 2026 as it found \"additional places we can remove layers.\"\n\nBeth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, didn't rule out more job cuts in the future, but said the company isn't trying to create \"a new rhythm\" of broad layoffs every few months.\n\n\"That's not our plan,\" Galetti wrote. \"But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, some employees in Amazon's cloud unit received an email sent in an apparent error acknowledging \"organizational changes\" at the company. The note referenced a post from Galetti and said Amazon notified \"impacted colleagues in our organization.\"\n\nAmazon had about 1.58 million employees as of the end of its third quarter. That figure is primarily made up of warehouse and logistics workers.\n\nThe 30,000 job cuts since October represent about 10% of its corporate and tech workforce, which comprises about 350,000 people.\n\nAmazon has been in the midst of a significant downsizing for the past several years. The company laid off more than 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and it conducted smaller cuts across various organizations in 2024.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy has looked to slim down Amazon's workforce after the company went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.\n\nJassy has also looked to reset Amazon's corporate culture so that it can operate like the \"world's largest startup.\" He set internal targets to slash management layers and established a \"no bureaucracy email alias\" to identify ways the company can innovate faster.\n\nAmazon has also been cutting costs across its business so that it can invest \n\nLast October, Amazon said it expects capital expenditures to reach $125 billion for 2026, the highest spending forecast among the megacap companies.\n\nJassy said last June that efficiency gains from AI would likely cause Amazon's corporate headcount to fall in the coming years.\n\n\"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\" Jassy said at the time.",

    "description": "How we use Claude Code with Skills, VMs, and automated testing to develop Ziva - a GUI plugin for Godot - across multiple parallel development environments.",
    "fullText": "Ziva, a GUI plugin for Godot, is developed by Claude Code in up to 4 VMs at once. Each VM uses Claude Skills to break down ambiguous tasks, and has a few extra nice-to-haves.\n\nZiva is a GUI app, but in dev mode, it exposes an API that Claude Code uses to perform actions and read state. This lets Claude Code follow a “Release Test ” skill, which delegates individual steps to subagents (tasks) to ensure we’re bug-free. It’s also great to use after developing new features.\n\nIf you’re not using Skills, think of them like template prompts.\n\nThe TL;DR of my main Custom Skills  is this -\n\nThe above will blow up your context if done in a single prompt. But by having each step be a stage with a handoff, you can compact without losing anything.\n\nOf course, this takes longer - but when you’re parallelized, it doesn’t matter. Using skills this way also lets you leverage subagents to do verification  on your plan or execution, to help avoid slop.\n\nWe use an Arch Linux base VM with KDE. It’s relatively lightweight and heavily customizable. In it, we have a custom init script, Claude Code, build and debug tools, and some custom widgets (more on that below)\n\nWe run our VMs with Virt-manager , and anytime we have an improvement, we modify the base image and reclone from it.\n\nAsk Claude Code to configure you a bell sound when waiting for user input (the idle_prompt  hook). On Linux, paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga does the trick.\n\nKDE allows you to add anything to your taskbar with the Command Output  widget.\n\nMake the widget read from a ~/.claude_state.txt file and combine it with a CLAUDE.md prompt to update on every major user request, and voila!\n\nAnother thing I love about KDE is the System Monitor Sensor widget. It’s configured to show RAM, CPU, and disk space all in one chart, so you can see when a VM (or the host) is suffering.\n\nWhile the monitor widget is great, managing VMs or identifying the root cause can be a pain. That is also done with a Claude Skill !\n\nI’ve been doing the VM-driven development flow for about a month now. The flexibility it provides lets me focus on important things like talking to users, using the product myself, or even writing this blog. Lots of folks are doing similar things, but little is written about it on the subject. Hopefully this helps someone out there!",

    "title": "As we breach 1.5°C, we must replace temperature limits with clean-energy targets",
    "description": "Actionable goals are needed to guide the world towards what needs to happen most quickly: shifting economies to clean energy sources.",
    "fullText": "On 28 October 2025, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres acknowledged that the totemic goal of the Paris climate agreement is going to be missed: “The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5 °C in the next few years”1.\n\nGuterres was merely stating the obvious. In 2024, Earth’s global mean surface temperature averaged 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels2, and the average for 2023–25 is 1.48 °C, perilously close to the limit. Keeping to the Paris target now looks impossible by any realistic measure. Yet this moment should not invite despair. Instead, it demands an urgent reframing of how climate progress is measured and mobilized.\n\nThe world today looks very different from that in 2015 when the Paris goal was framed. Although emissions are still rising and global actions on climate change are slow, a lot of progress has been made. Clean energy is expanding rapidly and decarbonization, not fossil fuels, is the new ‘business as usual’. In the first three quarters of 2025, growth in clean electricity generation outpaced that in energy demand for the first time, implying that fossil fuels are being displaced (see go.nature.com/3jvqzcb).\n\nWe argue that the main focus of climate action in 2026 and beyond should be on accelerating the clean-energy revolution. And the rate at which clean energy displaces fossil fuels in the global economy should become the key measure of climate progress. Here we describe how such progress can be tracked and incentivized using a metric we call the clean-energy shift. Unlike chasing intangible temperature targets, cleaning up the energy sector is a more-focused battle that the world can win.\n\nTo move forwards, climate scientists and policymakers must first accept that the Paris 1.5 °C target has outlived its usefulness. Although initially valuable as a unifying focus for international efforts to increase mitigation, continuing to emphasize a failed temperature target might produce more harm than good.\n\nOne reason is the difficulty of determining when and whether the world has crossed the line. Forecasts suggest that Earth is likely to exceed the 1.5 °C threshold around 2028, for instance (see go.nature.com/4pf95x6). But in the terminology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “exceedance” of 1.5 °C refers to the midpoint of a 20-year period at that level3. Confirmation would therefore not come until a decade after the fact.\n\nSuch a target, requiring years of expert interpretation to assess, could never have great salience for decision makers. And it challenges public understanding because, by definition, no person experiences global average temperatures. Moving to a higher number when 1.5 °C is crossed, such as 1.6 °C or 1.7 °C, would only make climate target setting seem arbitrary and unrooted in scientific evidence.\n\nMore concerningly, the emphasis on keeping Earth’s temperature below 1.5 °C might serve to justify risky interventions in the climate system. For example, injecting vast amounts of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere through ‘solar radiation modification’ could be one of the few remaining ways to bring 1.5 °C back into reach. But it might also alter precipitation patterns or result in a burst of warming if the programme were suddenly halted.\n\nMore complex temperature targets won’t help. Discussions have begun around the concept of ‘overshoot’, in which the planet’s average temperature would be brought back to 1.5 °C by 2100 after a period exceeding that level4. But its achievement would be even harder to pin down. While in overshoot, no one can be sure whether it is permanent or temporary. A successful return to 1.5 °C could be confirmed only at the end of the century.\n\nAny approach based on projections to 2100 is unlikely to inspire public interest or political action because the goal is so far off. It is hubristic to think that researchers can predict accurately how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will affect the climate, or how Earth’s climate system itself will respond to unprecedented conditions.\n\nInstead, we propose that policymakers focus on rapidly building the clean-energy systems that can deliver the safer climate and thriving economies that populations demand. These goals are already agreed. For example, in 2023 at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) 28 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, countries called for a tripling of renewable-energy capacity globally by 2030 and the transition away from fossil fuels to reach net zero by 2050. Whereas delegates at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, struggled to agree to phase out fossil fuels, support for accelerating clean energy is almost universal.\n\nTo fulfil this mandate, the world needs one clear number with which to measure climate progress during a transition that ends the use of fossil fuels. We think the most promising metric is one we term the ‘clean-energy shift’. Building on a concept initially proposed by Bloomberg New Energy Finance founder Michael Liebreich (see go.nature.com/3zr5y1), we define it as the growth rate in clean-energy generation minus the growth rate in total energy demand for a given time interval.\n\nThis metric emphasizes that clean-energy supply must expand faster than overall energy demand for decarbonization. When the percentage growth of clean-energy supply exceeds the growth in total energy use, fossil fuels get squeezed out of the system. By contrast, simply measuring clean energy share is insufficient, because fossil fuels might also rise overall to meet extra demand.\n\nFor example, if clean-energy grows by 6% each year and total energy demand grows by 3%, the clean-energy shift is +3%, meaning that clean energy is displacing fossil energy as a share of total energy generation. The bigger the number, the faster the exit from fossil fuels.\n\nClean-energy shift measures progress in a positive way5, towards a 100% clean economy, rather than negatively towards net zero. This would reduce the political resistance that arises from the perceived economic sacrifice of limiting emissions. Chasing the number zero will never motivate politicians concerned about economic development. Framing decarbonization as a story of building clean-energy industries and jobs is more appealing. The metric points to policies that are politically feasible, economically desirable and already advancing rapidly technologically, including solar, wind, batteries, geothermal, hydro and nuclear — without picking winners.\n\nThe power of pursuing this approach is evident in recent energy trends. Between 2018 and 2020, the annual percentage growth of clean-energy generation rose sharply, driven by rapid additions of solar, wind and storage capacities. Total global energy demand also grew, but at a slower rate, implying that growth in clean-energy production began eating into the share of fossil fuels. If this clean-energy shift can be increased further, the world would see a peak and then a steady decline in fossil-fuel use and related emissions. Indeed, data from China suggest the nation’s emissions peak could come as soon as this year6.\n\nIt is up to policymakers to determine how high the clean-energy shift should be. For example, to eliminate fossil fuels by 2050, the metric would need to rise substantially, from around 4% over the past five years, and keep climbing through the 2030s and 2040s. This means that clean-energy generation must continue its current rapid growth, rising several percentage points faster than total energy demand each year.\n\nAlthough challenging, trends in solar, wind and storage deployment suggest that this acceleration is achievable — although it will require expanded manufacturing capacity, grids built to integrate renewable technologies, continued reductions in battery costs and political will.\n\nTo achieve global decarbonization by 2050, policymakers need short-term milestones. We suggest they might set global targets of clean-energy shifts in five-year intervals — like rungs on a ladder, each climbing closer to a safe climate. It should be noted that the intervals are non-linear in terms of added capacity: because clean-energy shift is a percentage-growth metric, the higher rungs reflect increasingly rapid rates of clean-energy expansion, rather than a constant yearly addition.\n\nEncouragingly, the world has already climbed the first two rungs. We calculate an average shift of about 3.4% during 2014–19, rising to about 5.7% in 2024. The next rungs would need to sustain or increase these numbers to enable a fossil-fuels exit by 2050. Lower numbers would mean fossil fuels staying longer as part of the energy mix.\n\nThese intervals can be aligned with the five-year timelines used by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policy process, such as major COP agreements, reviews of ‘nationally determined contributions’ and ‘global stocktakes’ of progress towards the Paris goals for emissions reductions.\n\nThe clean-energy shift metric also respects long-established UN principles of equity and accountability, including the concept of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ in climate policy. The metric would not be a legally binding top-down number but the upward product of the collective efforts of all countries, which would continue to determine their own energy policies.\n\nIndividual countries can use the metric to track their own progress. And several major emitters already include clean-energy targets in their Paris commitments. For example, India met its 50% non-fossil power capacity goal five years ahead of its 2030 target. China has more than doubled its wind and solar capacity over the past three years. The European Union currently has about one-quarter of its energy consumption supplied by renewable sources, which it has mandated should rise to 42.5% within five years.\n\nNo metric can cover everything. And the clean-energy shift excludes emissions from sources other than fossil fuels, such as greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation, soil cultivation or wildfires. But the climate damage caused by fossil fuels is unique in its scale — comprising 90% of the carbon dioxide problem (38 of 42 gigatonnes in 2024)7.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00246-z\n\nWatts, J. & Xipai, W. in The Guardian (28 October 2025).\n\nWorld Meteorological Organization.

    "description": "I'll likely keep most of my stocks throughout a market crash, but these three will let me sleep soundly at night.",
    "fullText": "If the stock market crashes, I'm unlikely to sell many, or any, stocks.\n\nHowever, there are some that I'd be especially confident in holding even in a bad crash.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway and Prologis are likely to hold up better than most.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nI own about 45 stocks in my portfolio, and to be perfectly clear, if a stock market crash were to arrive, I'd be highly likely to hang on to all of them. I'll rarely ever sell stocks in a down market, unless something alarming happens within the business itself. One investing rule of thumb I never break is that I'll never sell a stock just because it's down.\n\nHaving said that, just because I wouldn't necessarily sell a stock doesn't mean that it wouldn't likely be stressful to hold in a market crash. But some stocks in my portfolio would hold up rather well during a market crash, allowing me to hold on while still sleeping well at night.\n\nIf I had to own just one stock amid a market crash, it would be Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nFor one thing, Berkshire owns a collection of more than 60 subsidiaries, most of which are \"evergreen,\" meaning they perform well regardless of the economy. As an example, people will still need to make their car insurance payments to GEICO in tough times, and they'll still need to make utility payments to Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\n\nPerhaps even more important, Berkshire has an unmatched amount of cash at its disposal. At the end of the third quarter, Berkshire had about $382 billion on its balance sheet, and I wouldn't be surprised to see this figure increase when we get fourth-quarter earnings shortly.\n\nThis gives Berkshire tremendous financial flexibility to take advantage of investment opportunities if the stock market crashes. After making savvy investments in Bank of America and Goldman Sachs around the time of the financial crisis, Berkshire emerged from that crash an even stronger company, and there's no reason to expect anything different if the market crashes now.\n\nPrologis (NYSE: PLD) is an industrial real estate investment trust, or REIT, that I'd be happy to hold throughout a market crash. The largest REIT in the market, Prologis owns more than 1 billion square feet of logistics real estate -- properties like distribution centers and warehouses.\n\nIn a nutshell, e-commerce isn't going anywhere, even if the stock market is in turmoil. Companies like Amazon, FedEx, and others will still need to move items around the world. We could certainly see demand for new properties decline in tough times, but the long-term trend clearly points to greater e-commerce volume.",

    "description": "Rachel Green, 44, had an undiagnosed heart condition, investigators reportedly found",
    "fullText": "A Minnesota woman’s family is speaking out after she died while asleep on her mother’s shoulder during an international flight from the U.S. to the U.K.\n\nRachel Green, a 44-year-old attorney and writer, died on a Delta Air Lines flight from Minneapolis to London on April 30, 2025, according to a GoFundMe started by her family.\n\nNow, investigators in the U.K. have revealed what likely caused her death.\n\nThe West London Coroner’s Court recently heard that Green’s death was likely the result of an undiagnosed heart condition in combination with prescription medications, according to The Irish Sun.\n\nDr. Alan Bates, a pathologist, said he found multiple substances in her blood, including melatonin, antidepressants and a small amount of alcohol, the outlet reports.\n\nBates also said he found evidence of myocardial tunneling, a condition in which an artery travels through the heart muscle, rather than on its surface, according to The Irish Sun.\n\nSenior Coroner Lydia Brown reportedly said Green had taken a “range of complex medications,” but there was “no evidence she was taking any in excess.”\n\n“She also had a congenital heart condition. This contributed to her death, along with the medications,” Brown said.\n\nGreen’s sister, Roxanne Carney, said she had an “abnormal” heart test that wasn’t investigated further, according to The Irish Sun. Now, she’s questioning why her sister “was never referred to a cardiologist before being prescribed this combination.”\n\n“Why was she on this regimen? Why are they prescribing this combination of medications?” Carney reportedly said.\n\nShe added: “If you can see all the records, ethically, how can you do this?”\n\nSenior Coroner Lydia Brown said in court that it is typically “reviewed” in the U.K., but that “the entirety of your population doesn’t seem to have that.”\n\n“[It is] unusual to find so many different [drugs]. Matters are done very differently in the U.S.,” Brown reportedly said.\n\nGreen was traveling to London to complete research for an upcoming historical fiction work on Eleanor of Aquitaine, an influential medieval queen, her family said on the GoFundMe page. She was described as a “brilliant writer” who had a keen love of theatre.\n\n“Rachel was beyond selfless, always taking care of everyone around her and trying to guide people to the goodness in life, be it traveling, enjoying a play, or a gathering,” her family wrote.\n\nGreen had also just recovered from an “unexpected illness” that forced her to relocate to her hometown in Minnesota and relearn how to walk.\n\n“She exuded unyielding strength and courage at even the most difficult times,” the GoFundMe page reads.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Carney and Delta Air Lines for comment.",

    "description": "Scarborough played back the Hannity's criticism of ICE raids on places like Home Depot, suggesting a “responsible” program instead.",
    "fullText": "Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough was “struck” by the fact he agreed with Sean Hannity on Tuesday as he replayed a clip of the conservative host’s criticism of ICE raids on places like Home Depot – suggesting a “responsible” program for undocumented immigrants to “come forward.”\n\nA day earlier, during The Sean Hannity Show on Premiere Radio Networks, Hannity said such raids on stores were not “a good idea” and argued undocumented immigrants working there were “not the immediate problem.”\n\nHe then suggested a program that would offer those who came forward “transportation home” with some money, as well as an avenue to “apply to come back in the country legally.”\n\n“I think that’d be a more responsible, reasonable way to deal with that problem,” Hannity said.\n\nScarborough played back the clip on air Tuesday as he reflected that this was a common ground one that he’d championed “all along” since he was a Republican congressman himself:\n\nI am struck by Sean Hannity’s words and struck because that position has been what I’ve been saying all along, what I’ve been saying since 1994. And I’m struck that the administration didn’t start here.\n\nAnd I’m struck because, again, most Americans believe that if you are here illegally that you should be deported, as Sean Hannity said, people have been talking about this for years, give people money to get back home. Then have those people reapply to come back to America and yes, get in line with people all over the world that are applying and trying to do this the correct way. But if you’ve been in America for a long time, if you’ve been law abiding, if you’re an asylum seeker, certainly if you’ve had children that have served in the military, you’re at the front of the line.\n\nHe also defended having held the stance, lamenting that Republicans had not voiced what he called an “established view”:\n\nWhat’s very unfortunate for this country and politically unfortunate for the administration, [for] Republicans, is it’s taken them this long to express this publicly in the face of some violent tactics over the past 6 to 9 months. And I just want to repeat this because I don’t think I know Republicans watch this, and I don’t think they listen sometimes to what I’m saying. They just go, ‘Oh, Joe’s a lefty!’ – no, I’m not, I’m just not. I have been saying this from the beginning.\n\nThe post Joe Scarborough ‘Struck’ as He Agrees With Sean Hannity on ICE: ‘Most Americans Believe That’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Filing by New Mexico’s attorney general includes Meta staff emails objecting to AI companion policy\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, approved allowing minors to access artificial intelligence chatbot companions that safety staffers warned were capable of sexual interactions, according to internal Meta documents filed in a New Mexico state court case and made public on Monday.\n\nThe lawsuit – brought by the state’s attorney general, Raul Torrez, and scheduled for trial next month – alleges Meta “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children” on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe filing on Monday included internal Meta employee emails and messages obtained by the New Mexico attorney general’s office through legal discovery. The state alleges they show that “Meta, driven by Zuckerberg, rejected the recommendations of its integrity staff and declined to impose reasonable guardrails to prevent children from being subject to sexually exploitative conversations with its AI chatbots”, the attorney general said in the filing. Meta announced last week that it had removed teen access to AI companions entirely, pending creation of a new version of the chatbots.\n\nIn the communications, some of Meta’s safety staff expressed objections the company was building chatbots geared for companionship, including sexual and romantic interactions with users. The artificial intelligence chatbots were released in early 2024. The documents cited in the state’s filing Monday don’t include messages or memos authored by Zuckerberg.\n\nAndy Stone, a Meta spokesperson, on Monday said the state’s portrayal was inaccurate and relied on selective information: “This is yet another example of the New Mexico attorney general cherrypicking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture.”\n\nMessages in the filing showed safety staff had special concern about the bots being used for romantic scenarios between adults and minors under the age of 18, referred to as “U18s”.\n\n“I don’t believe that creating and marketing a product that creates U18 romantic AI’s for adults is advisable or defensible,” wrote Ravi Sinha, head of Meta’s child safety policy, in January 2024.\n\nIn reply, Antigone Davis, Meta’s global safety head, agreed that safety staff should push to block adults from creating underage romantic companions because “it sexualizes minors”. Sinha and Davis did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAccording to one February 2024 message, a Meta employee whose name was redacted relayed that Zuckerberg believed that AI companions should be blocked from engaging in sexually “explicit” conversations with at least younger teens and that adults should not be able to interact with “U18 AIs for romance purposes”.\n\nA summary of a meeting dated 20 February 2024, said the CEO believed the “narrative should be framed around … general principles of choice and non-censorship”, that Meta should be “less restrictive than proposed”, and that he wanted to “allow adults to engage in racier conversation on topics like sex”.\n\nStone said the documents did not support New Mexico’s case. “Even these select documents clearly show Mark Zuckerberg giving the direction that explicit AIs shouldn’t be available to younger users and that adults shouldn’t be able to create under 18 AIs for romantic purposes.”\n\nMessages between two employees from March 2024 state that Zuckerberg had rejected creating parental controls for the chatbots, and that staffers were working on “Romance AI chatbots” that would be allowed for users under the age of 18.\n\nWe “pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off – but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision”, one employee wrote in that exchange.\n\nNick Clegg, who was Meta’s head of global policy until early 2025, said in an email included in the court documents he thought Meta’s approach to sexualized AI companions was unwise.\n\nExpressing concern that sexual interactions could be the dominant use case for Meta’s AI companions by teenage users, Clegg said: “Is that really what we want these products to be known for (never mind the inevitable societal backlash which would ensue)?” Clegg did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeta’s AI chatbot policies eventually came to light, prompting a backlash in the US Congress and elsewhere.\n\nA Wall Street Journal article in April 2025 found that Meta’s chatbots included overtly sexualized underage characters and that they engaged in all-ages sexual roleplay, including graphic descriptions of prepubescent bodies. Reuters reported in August that Meta’s official guidelines for chatbots stated that it is “acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual”. In response to the report, Meta said it was changing its policies and that the internal document granting such approval had been in error.",

    "fullText": "Advertising Standards Authority says firm advised by George Osborne ‘trivialised risks of cryptocurrency’\n\nA cryptocurrency company advised by George Osborne has been banned from showing a set of adverts that suggested using its services could be a solution to the cost of living crisis.\n\nCoinbase, which appointed the former Conservative chancellor to chair its global advisory council last year, has been told by the UK’s advertising watchdog that its adverts were “irresponsible” and “trivialised the risks of cryptocurrency”.\n\nThe adverts from the US crypto exchange include a sarcastic two-minute video showing people singing “everything is just fine, everything is grand” as their home falls into a state of disrepair and suffers a power cut, while outside Britons cheerfully dance through streets littered with rats and piles of overflowing bin bags.\n\nAs the ad progresses, a shopper faces rising prices for fish fingers in a supermarket, white-collar workers lose their jobs, a sewage pipe bursts and rubbish falls from the sky.\n\nThe clip ends with large text saying: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything”, before being replaced with the Coinbase logo. The company, which was founded in 2012, provides a platform for people to buy and sell various cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advertising campaign, which launched in August, implied that using Coinbase could be an alternative to the financial concerns associated with the cost of living, and so trivialised the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\n“We considered that using humour to reference serious financial concerns, alongside a cue to ‘change’, risked presenting complex, high-risk financial products as an easy or obvious response to those concerns,” it said.\n\nOsborne was appointed in December to run Coinbase’s global advisory council to assist with the company’s lobbying in the UK and EU, having already been an adviser to the company for the past two years.\n\nThe company’s chief policy officer at the time said Osborne would play an “active role in helping us with policymakers around the world”. Last August, the former Tory MP had written a column in the Financial Times warning that the UK has been left behind in the cryptocurrency boom and is in danger of missing a second wave of demand.\n\nThe former politician last month added a role at ChatGPT developer OpenAI to his portfolio of positions, which also includes being the chair of the British Museum and a co-host of a podcast with the former Labour minister Ed Balls.\n\nThree posters from Coinbase were also banned by the ASA, which in large letters stated: “Home ownership out of reach,” as well as “real wages stuck in 2008” and “eggs now out of budget”. Small white background text read: “Everything is fine”repeatedly. The bottom of the poster said: “If everything’s fine, don’t change anything” next to the Coinbase logo.\n\nNeither the video nor the posters contained any information about the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, the ASA said, despite the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warning that cryptocurrency is “largely unregulated and high risk, and that buyers should be prepared to lose all of their money”.\n\nThe video advert by Coinbase had already been banned from television by Clearcast, which approves television ads in the UK, but the ASA said it had been shown on multiple online platforms, while the posters had been displayed in “high-traffic areas such as the London Underground and rail stations”.\n\nA spokesperson for Coinbase said: “While we respect the ASA’s decision, we fundamentally disagree with the characterisation of a campaign that critically reflects widely reported economic conditions as socially irresponsible.\n\n“The advert was intended to provoke discussion about the state of the financial system and the need to consider better futures, not to offer simplistic solutions or minimise risk.\n\n“While digital assets are not a panacea, we believe their responsible adoption can play a constructive role in a more efficient and freer financial system. Coinbase remains committed to authentic, thought-provoking communication and to operating responsibly within the UK’s regulatory framework.”",

    "fullText": "Workers informed after message had erroneously said affected employees in US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told\n\nAmazon has told workers it is cutting 16,000 jobs globally to streamline its operations, hours after sending out a message to staff about the layoffs apparently in error.\n\nIt is the second major wave of job cuts at the US online retail giant, and comes just three months after the company said it was slashing 14,000 roles.\n\nThe majority of jobs affected are expected to be in the US, although some roles in the UK may also be affected.\n\nThe company said the “additional organisational changes” were designed to “strengthen our organisation by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy”, according to a blogpost to staff from Beth Galetti, the senior vice president of people experience and technology.\n\nGaletti said some teams had not been affected by the job cuts announced in October, but this was not the beginning of regular waves of layoffs. “Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm – where we announce broad reductions every few months. That’s not our plan,” she wrote.\n\nUS-based employees who are affected will be offered 90 days to find a new role internally, with the timing for applying for new roles varying in other countries.\n\nGaletti said Amazon would continue to hire new staff and invest in “strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future”.\n\nThe official announcement came just hours after workers at Amazon Web Services (AWS) received an online meeting invitation from a top executive on Tuesday for the following day – subsequently cancelled – that also contained a draft email revealing the cuts.\n\nThe message erroneously said that affected employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica had already been told they had lost their jobs.\n\nIt was signed by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice-president of applied AI solutions at the company’s cloud computing arm AWS, while the layoffs were referred to in the email as “Project Dawn”.\n\n“Changes like this are hard on everyone,” Aubrey wrote in the email, which was seen by multiple news outlets including Reuters and Bloomberg. “These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organisation and AWS for future success.”\n\nThe email referred to a separate message from Amazon’s human resources boss, which did not appear to have been sent.\n\nAmazon has been trying to reverse a pandemic hiring spree in an effort to cut costs and slim down its huge operation, which employs about 1.5 million people worldwide.\n\nAmazon’s chief executive, Andy Jassy, has previously warned white-collar workers at the company that their jobs could be taken by AI in the next few years.\n\nThe news of fresh Amazon layoffs came as the US delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS) said it would cut up to 30,000 jobs this year, adding to last year’s job reductions, as it focuses on higher-margin shipments.\n\nUPS has been working to cut millions of low-value deliveries it carries out for Amazon, which is its largest customer but increasingly also a delivery rival. UPS has called its business with Amazon “extraordinarily dilutive” to margins.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday, while Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs filed an objection saying immigration agents tried to enter the country's consulate in the city without permission.\n\nOfficers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.\n\nA Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.\n\nInvestigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.\n\nSeparately, a man was arrested after he sprayed an unknown liquid at U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was speaking at a town hall meeting in Minneapolis. The Democrat had just called for the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign when she was sprayed.\n\nTrump says 'we're going to de-escalate a little bit'\n\nThe developments came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti's death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.\n\nThe president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.\n\nAs he left the White House on Tuesday, the president was asked whether Pretti’s killing was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.\n\nStephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff who had initially called Pretti “an assassin,” issued a statement suggesting CBP officers in Minneapolis “may not have been following” protocol. He said the Homeland Security Department’s initial statements about what transpired on Saturday was “based on reports from CBP on the ground.”\n\nEcuador files a protest with the US Embassy\n\nA video of the Ecuadorian consulate entry attempt posted on social media shows a staffer running to the door to turn the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.\n\nInternational law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.\n\n“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.\n\nA “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘Maybe it wasn’t good here’\n\nImmigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.\n\nThe White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti’s killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.\n\nTrump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with the city's police chief, met with Homan on Tuesday and agreed to keep talking. Homan posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.”\n\nCourts weigh in on detained immigrants\n\nIn Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.\n\nAlso in Texas, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of ICE to appear in his courtroom, the man's attorney said.\n\nAttorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.\n\nIn an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.\n\nSchiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.\n\n“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.\n\nSchiltz's order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.\n\nSchiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.\n\nCatalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey and Karnowski from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis, Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents attempted to enter the Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis on Tuesday, prompting the country’s minister of foreign affairs to file a protest with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador.\n\nA video of the incident was posted online. It shows staff inside the consulate rushing to the door to prevent the agents from entering. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!” one man exclaimed. “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.”\n\nEcuador’s foreign ministry issued a statement in Spanish about the incident. The following is an English translation of the statement:\n\nREGARDING THE ATTEMPTED INCURSION INTO THE ECUADORIAN CONSULATE IN MINNEAPOLIS BY ICE AGENTS\n\nThis morning, the Ecuadorian Consul in Minneapolis reported that, at approximately 11:00 a.m., an agent from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attempted to enter the Consulate premises.\n\nConsulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular office, thus guaranteeing the protection of the Ecuadorian citizens who were present at the consulate at that time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility.\n\nTherefore, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic immediately submitted a letter of protest to the United States Embassy in Ecuador to ensure that acts of this nature are not repeated at any of Ecuador’s consular offices in the United States.\n\nGenerally speaking, officials from host countries need permission from consular staff to enter the premises. The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations – to which the U.S. is a party – states, “The authorities of the receiving State shall not enter that part of the consular premises which is used exclusively for the purpose of the work of the consular post except with the consent of the head of the consular post or of his designee or of the head of the diplomatic mission of the sending State.”\n\nICE and Border Patrol agents have swarmed the Twin Cities area in recent weeks as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown. On Saturday, Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, who had been filming their activities in public. Earlier this month in the city, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good as she attempted to drive away from agents.\n\nThe post ICE Agents Try To Enter Ecuadorian Consulate in Minneapolis first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "This is just one in a long line of incidents that show that human-wildlife encounters often end poorly.",
    "fullText": "In 2022, a couple from Los Angeles was vacationing in a luxury treehouse in Truchas, New Mexico. As part of their stay, the couple booked a tour of the ranch where the treehouse was located, which included the chance to feed bison — an opportunity that allegedly ended with the woman being gored in the arm.\n\nNow, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican, the woman is suing the person who rented out the treehouse, the ranch owner, and the website where the treehouse was booked for unspecified damages related to the alleged incident.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Sarah Fiskin and her partner were feeding the bison pellets from a can. However, the lawsuit claims that once the pellets began running low, one bison, Junior, became agitated and started crowding Fiskin to get more.\n\nWhile doing that, according to the lawsuit and per the Santa Fe New Mexican, Junior \"violently swung his horns\" and gored Fiskin's arm, leaving her with \"a massive gaping puncture wound.\" As a result, Fiskin claims she needed surgery, and the incident left her with permanent and severe physical and psychological injuries.\n\nWhile the website and the ranch owner declined to comment on the matter, Sandra Webb, the woman who rented the property, shared a different version of events. According to Webb, Fiskin dropped one of the pellets on the ground, which Junior bent down to get. Upon lifting his head, one of Junior's horns caught Fiskin's arm.\n\nWebb also shared that she and her insurance company have tried for the past several years to settle the matter, including an offer of roughly $300,000, but the other side declined.\n\nThis is just one in a long line of incidents that show that human-wildlife encounters often end poorly. However, it's important to note that just as often, they also end poorly for the animal involved. If Junior were a wild bison, chances are good that wildlife authorities would have tracked him down and euthanized him for this incident, as that's typically what happens.\n\nWhether animals appear to be tame, as Webb claimed these bison were, or not, it's advisable to stay far away from wildlife of all kinds to prevent injury.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Micron edges out Western Digital as AI-driven memory demand, tight supply and a cheaper valuation make MU the more attractive pick now.",
    "fullText": "Both Western Digital Corporation WDC and Micron Technology MU are major players in the memory and storage ecosystem, with exposure to NAND flash and data-center demand tied to AI, cloud computing and cyclical memory pricing. Western Digital and Micron are both well-positioned to benefit from global data growth through storage and memory solutions, making them closely watched by investors betting on AI infrastructure and cloud expansion.\n\nBoth operate in the broader data storage ecosystem, but they play distinct roles. Western Digital is traditionally known for HDDs and, increasingly, enterprise storage systems. It also has flash memory exposure, though that part was largely spun off through SanDisk in 2025. Micron is a pure memory champion in DRAM, HBM and NAND flash. Both have soared in value recently, driven by demand tied to data growth and AI infrastructure. But their futures hinge on different markets and technology cycles.\n\nHowever, if investors must choose between the two, which stock should they consider based on business models, growth drivers, risks, financials & valuation, outlooks and final verdict?\n\nAI adoption is accelerating across industries, driving innovation, reshaping business models and advancing digital transformation through higher productivity and richer user experiences. As agentic AI scales and multimodal LLMs become mainstream, WDC is seeing growing AI use cases that are fueling sustained demand for data infrastructure. AI is both a major consumer and creator of data, transforming how data is generated, stored, scaled and monetized. As data volumes expand rapidly, HDDs remain the most reliable, scalable and cost-effective solution for storing the zettabytes of data powering the AI-driven economy.\n\nAI is improving efficiency across corporate functions. At the same time, rising AI and data-driven workloads at hyperscalers are boosting demand for WDC’s storage solutions. Customers are shifting to higher-capacity drives, leading to strong shipments of its latest ePMR products, including up to 26TB CMR and 32TB UltraSMR drives. WDC continues to scale ePMR technology, invest in advanced media and wafer innovation, and use automation and AI to increase manufacturing capacity and efficiency. The reliability, scalability and cost advantages of Western Digital’s ePMR and UltraSMR drives continue to drive data center success, with the company preparing to build on this momentum through next-generation HAMR technology.\n\nStrong customer commitments—extending into 2027—underscore confidence in its roadmap and its role in the AI data economy. HAMR development is progressing well, with customer qualification beginning in early 2026 and volume production targeted for the first half of 2027. Meanwhile, next-gen ePMR drives will complete qualification by early 2026, supporting a smooth transition. Management expects continued revenue growth and improved profitability in the fiscal second quarter, driven by strong data center demand and higher-capacity drive adoption. At the mid-point of its guidance, Western Digital anticipates non-GAAP revenues of $2.9 billion (+/- $100 million), up 20% year over year.",

    "description": "Randy Santos had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he left jail months earlier",
    "fullText": "A man on trial for the brutal bludgeoning deaths of four men sleeping on New York City streets was suffering from schizophrenia and believed he had to kill 40 people to save his own life, a jury heard on Tuesday. His lawyer revealed that Randy Santos, 31, had been diagnosed with the condition months before the attacks, following his release from prison.\n\nSantos is asserting an insanity defense at his trial in a Manhattan state court. While his legal team acknowledges he committed the 2019 Chinatown rampage, they argue he cannot be held criminally responsible. They contend that mental illness had \"polluted his mind with irrational thoughts and left him prone to violence.\"\n\nThe court was told that Santos was \"hearing voices telling him he needed to kill 40 people or he would die too.\" If the defense succeeds, he could be sent to a psychiatric treatment facility instead of prison.\n\n“He needed the voices to stop. he needed to save his own life,\" Santos’ lawyer, Marnie Zien, said in an opening statement. “He saw no other way out.”\n\nSantos, 31, has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder in the deaths of Florencio Moran, Nazario Vásquez Villegas, Anthony Manson and Chuen Kok and attempted murder charges for assaults that left two other men severely injured. They were among 319 killings in New York City in 2019, including 52 in Manhattan.\n\nSurveillance video captured Santos “repeatedly lifting the bar up over his head and bringing it down on the head” of one victim, Assistant District Attorney Alfred Peterson told jurors.\n\nA couple out on a date on Manhattan’s Bowery street saw him beating another man with the same weapon, Peterson said. Police found Santos carrying the bar, which was covered with blood and hair. Testing showed it had his DNA on one end and blood from some of his victims on the other, the prosecutor said.\n\nIf the jury convicts Santos, rejecting his insanity defense, he could be sentenced to life in prison. Otherwise, he could be involuntarily committed to treatment for as long as necessary.\n\nPeterson urged jurors to look past Santos' mental health claims and find him guilty on all charges, telling them that evidence will show that Santos “knew exactly what he was doing and the consequences of what he was doing — that he was killing these men,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nSantos looked up and down the street and “saw the coast was clear” before starting the attack, Peterson said. He then paused to let a pedestrian — and potential witness — leave the area before wailing on another man, Peterson said. He knew “it was legally and morally wrong,” the prosecutor said.\n\nSantos even recognized himself in surveillance video of the attack, Peterson said. Shown the footage after his arrest, he told police: “Yea, that’s me.”\n\nSantos, a native of the Dominican Republic who moved to New York as a child, attacked five men between 1:30 a.m. and 2 a.m. on Oct. 5, 2019, bashing their heads repeatedly with a 4-foot (1.2 meter) bar he found on the street, Peterson said. The victims ranged in age from 39 to 83.\n\nThe lone survivor, critically injured 49-year-old David Hernandez, staggered to a nearby street where police officers were trying to revive another Santos victim.\n\nPeterson said Santos had done a “trial run” about a week earlier, badly hurting another man by bashing his head with a wooden stick in a different Manhattan neighborhood.\n\nSantos, who has gone back and forth from jail to psychiatric treatment facilities since his arrest, wore an untucked white button-down shirt and a tie as he sat between his lawyers at the defense table. He listened to Zien’s opening statement through a Spanish interpreter, but moved his headphones off his ear as Peterson spoke.\n\nPrevailing with an insanity defense can be particularly tough in New York. Santos’ lawyers must convince the jury that he didn’t understand the consequences of his actions and didn’t know right from wrong. The strategy has had mixed results.\n\nIn 2022, a man who killed a young tourist when he drove his car through crowds of people in Times Square was cleared of responsibility and sent to a mental health facility instead of prison after a jury found he was so psychologically disturbed he didn’t know what he was doing.\n\nBut in 2018, a Manhattan nanny was convicted of killing two children in her care while their parents were away after a jury rejected her lawyer's claims that she had an undiagnosed mental illness, heard voices and saw hallucinations, snapped and didn’t know what she was doing.\n\nZien said Santos knew that attacking the men was legally wrong, but — in his mind — he had to do it to save his own life.\n\nThe ambush, she said, was the last in a line of increasingly violent episodes that began with a clash with his grandfather.\n\nHe has at least six prior arrests, police said, including allegations that he punched a tourist he thought was laughing at him on a subway train, choked a man at an employment agency and punched a homeless man inside a Brooklyn shelter.\n\nDuring his last jail stint before the killings, Santos was diagnosed with schizophrenia, Zein said. He was released in August 2019 and given referrals for treatment and prescriptions for medication but never used them, Zein said.\n\nSantos was previously diagnosed with schitzophreniform, a shorter-term mental health condition, and turned up at a hospital complaining that he was hearing voices in his head, Zein said.\n\nHe was asked about drug use but didn't get the treatment he needed, she said.",

    "fullText": "A Maryland truck driver suffered an “eye stroke” that left him blind, first in one eye and then the other.\n\nA Louisiana woman vomited for weeks before being diagnosed with a brain dysfunction typically caused by a vitamin deficiency.\n\nAn Oklahoma real estate agent heard her colon pop as it ruptured while she drove her granddaughter home from a softball game. “My colon blew up. Literally blew up,” she said.\n\nShe had just wanted to finally lose that extra 40 pounds.\n\nAll three have filed lawsuits that blame the popular class of weight-loss drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which include Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro, and they’re part of a growing number of lawsuits alleging the drugs’ makers failed to sufficiently warn of the risk of certain severe injuries.\n\nThe suits come as the use of the blockbuster drugs has skyrocketed, embraced by millions of Americans to manage diabetes, lower the risk of heart disease and lose weight. The drugs, which mimic a hormone that slows digestion, triggers insulin and helps people feel full longer, cut America’s stubbornly high obesity rates – for the first time in more than a decade – and show promise in aiding a range of conditions from kidney disease to drug addiction.\n\nPlaintiffs represent only a fraction of the 12% of American adults – or more than 31 million people – the nonpartisan health policy organization KFF estimates are currently using a GLP-1 drug. The plaintiffs say the drug warnings at the time didn’t prepare them for what they encountered.\n\nSince the first such case was filed in 2023, at least 4,400 patients have filed lawsuits that are now part of consolidated federal and state litigation, numbers that are expected to grow as part of legal challenges expected to take several years.\n\nThe suits target Novo Nordisk, the Danish manufacturer of Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus, Victoza and Saxenda and Indiana-based Eli Lilly, which makes Trulicity, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The drugmakers have broadly refuted the allegations, and said they will vigorously defend the drugs’ safety.\n\nIn court on Jan. 13, Novo Nordisk’s attorney Katie Insogna reported:\n\n75% of the federal lawsuits include an allegation of gastroparesis, also known as “stomach paralysis,” a chronic condition where the stomach slows or stops emptying food into the small intestine;\n\n18% of the cases allege the drugs caused ileus, a condition in which bowel muscles fail to push food and waste out of the body;\n\n18% of the plaintiffs allege intestinal obstructions;\n\n8% say they suffered from gallbladder injuries, with some of these patients requiring surgical removal of gangrenous tissue;\n\n8% of the plaintiffs allege other serious gastrointestinal complications, such as extreme vomiting, chronic acid reflux or abdominal pain that required multiple hospitalizations in some cases. Others say their digestion issues have continued even after they stopped taking the drugs.\n\nThese figures add up to more than 100% since many plaintiffs are alleging multiple side effects from taking GLP-1 drugs. USA TODAY found similar numbers when it examined a random sample of 100 of the federal lawsuits.\n\nIn addition, USA TODAY’s review revealed at least 110 plaintiffs across both the federal and state lawsuits allege the drugs caused sudden blindness or severe vision changes, and at least one plaintiff says she’s developed a serious neurological condition called Wernicke's encephalopathy that causes mental confusion, double vision and poor coordination.\n\nIn a 2024 joint court filing, the two companies said that “the safety profile of GLP-1 RAs has been well-established in hundreds of clinical trials, large-scale observational studies, and nearly two decades of real-world use. The known risks associated with these medicines are reflected in their FDA-approved product labeling which, collectively, FDA has reviewed more than 40 times and are discussed in textbooks, treatment guidelines and journals.”\n\nNovo Nordisk updates product labels “in cooperation with the FDA and consistent with federal regulations to reflect the most current understanding of the safety and efficacy profile of our medicines,” said Flavia Brakling, a spokesperson for the company. “Novo Nordisk remains confident in the benefit-risk profile of our GLP-1 medicines, when used consistent with their indications and product labeling.”\n\nMichael Jamison, a spokesperson for Eli Lilly sent a statement: “Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority, and we actively monitor, evaluate, and report safety information for all our medicines. Mounjaro, Zepbound, and Trulicity’s labels include robust, FDA-approved warnings, and have always warned of potential ‘gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe.’”\n\nHe added, “As part of our routine safety review process for Mounjaro, Zepbound and Trulicity, we work closely with regulators regarding potential safety topics, and we will continue to review data to ensure that appropriate safety information is available to prescribers.”\n\nAna Santos Rutschman, a health law professor at Villanova University, said proving the drugs caused certain outcomes will be an issue as the legal battle unfolds, along with the extent and timing of warnings. And she’ll be watching to see how the legal fight influences public trust and the market for such drugs while raising larger questions about what level of drug risk warnings are deemed sufficient.\n\nWhile some of the warnings “have changed over the last few years and and to some degree gotten better in the United States,” said Jonathan Orent, a lead plaintiffs’ attorney with Motley Rice in the multidistrict litigation overseen by a federal court in Philadelphia, “we think that the full panoply of conditions that this set of drugs can cause are not fully warned of, and until that happens, people are continuing to get hurt without having the full information.”\n\nSide effects: GLP-1s may weaken the pelvic floor, impacting women's health – and their sex lives\n\nMore: These people lost their sense of taste. Are GLP-1s to blame?\n\nSome of the plaintiffs who spoke to USA TODAY said they hope to see stronger or more specific warnings about the potential for severe outcomes.\n\n“This whole thing has been catastrophic to me and my wife,” said Todd Engel, the Maryland truck driver, who alleges in his lawsuit that Ozempic led to his vision loss.\n\nEngel had been taking Ozempic to manage his diabetes for about four months when he woke up in December of 2023 with a loss of vision in one eye, he told USA TODAY in an interview.\n\nThe 63-year-old, who drove snowplows and hauled heavy equipment for Howard County, Maryland, was diagnosed with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, called NAION, thought to result from reduced blood flow to the optic nerve. It is sometimes referred to as an “eye stroke.”\n\nWhile diabetes is one risk factor for the condition, he said his health providers ran tests for various potential causes but found no firm answers. His medication didn’t come up as something that could potentially be related to it, he said, so he kept taking his injections.\n\nIn October of 2024, he said, he woke up and turned to his wife, Shelley, to tell her his other eye had gone dark.\n\n“You’re not going to believe this,” she recalled him saying. “I can’t see at all.”\n\nNow legally blind, Engel has had to quit his job and give up his commercial driver’s license. He can’t see his grandkids play baseball, he said, and the couple has shelved much of their retirement travel bucket list.\n\nHe later learned that some research has suggested a potential link between semaglutide and the eye condition. For example, in a study of almost 17,000 people published in JAMA Ophthalmology in 2024, researchers found an increased risk of NAION among individuals prescribed semaglutide relative to those prescribed other medications to treat type-2 diabetes and obesity. But it noted it did not establish a causal relationship.\n\nIn June, a European medical safety committee noted that Wegovy and Ozempic have been linked in “very rare” cases to the eye condition, Reuters reported, which led Novo Nordisk to update its European labels for Wegovy and Ozempic to state that semaglutide, their active ingredient, may cause NAION in up to 1 in 10,000 patients.\n\nU.S. labels warn of vision changes without mentioning NAION. The American Academy of Ophthalmology has said it does not support a blanket recommendation for all patients to immediately stop taking semaglutide if they develop NAION because of risks for those with difficult-to-manage diabetes or underlying vascular health conditions. Instead, they recommend that patients carefully consult health care providers before making a decision. And it noted that \"a review of the available data has not established that semaglutide causes NAION, only a potential link between the two.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk did not comment directly on Engel’s individual lawsuit when asked for comment.\n\nIn court documents, the drug companies note that diabetic patients are already at a higher risk of conditions like blindness, gastroparesis and intestinal dysfunction.\n\nNovo Nordisk said in a statement that updates to labeling are made in conjunction with the FDA and federal regulations.\n\nFor example, Ozempic’s FDA label was expanded in September 2023, shortly after the first lawsuits were filed, to include ileus as a possible gastrointestinal disorder. By late 2025, it had been updated again, to include effects such as intestinal obstruction and severe constipation including fecal impaction, among several other additions. Also last year, Trulicity’s label added \"acute pancreatitis, hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death\" to its disclosures.\n\nBut Engel said that had he or his physicians been aware of the possible link to the eye condition that could cause permanent blindness, something that seemed far from a simple side effect, he would have reconsidered taking it – and certainly would have stopped taking it after his first eye stroke.\n\n\"What happened to me should have never happened,\" he said.\n\nAt home, Engel’s wife Shelley said she has had to place raised plastic dots on the microwave start button so he can warm food. He uses smart glasses with a microphone and a camera to ask what room he’s in as he learns to live without sight.\n\n“I wake up in the dark, and I go to sleep in the dark,” he said.\n\nJoHelen McClain, a 72-year-old real estate agent from suburban Oklahoma City, had a simple goal when she started taking Wegovy in November of 2023.\n\n“I was trying to slim down and feel healthy,” she told USA TODAY in an interview.\n\nThe grandmother saw her weight fall from 205 pounds to 165, with little of the nausea she’d heard so much about. Wegovy even seemed to ease inflammation and pain from her rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nIn March of 2024, McClain was driving her 14-year-old granddaughter home from high-school softball when they heard a loud noise. It sounded like a balloon popping, she said.\n\n“What was that?” she recalled her granddaughter blurting out.\n\nIt was the sound of her colon rupturing.\n\nMcClain said she was lucky to be close to a hospital emergency room, where she learned a blockage had caused the rupture. She was stunned it hadn’t produced any noticeable warning symptoms, such as feeling constipated.\n\nTaken into surgery, she said doctors had to remove a large portion of her colon. She spent five days in the ICU battling sepsis and then faced months of painful recovery, barely able to eat or get out of bed.\n\nDoctors created a stoma, or valve in her torso, telling her she’d have to live permanently with a bag that connects to collect stool. The bag has caused embarrassing leaks and anxiety, she said, while she has battled depression and anxiety.\n\nShe blames Wegovy in a federal lawsuit filed in January 2026. The allegations in the lawsuit include a failure to warn of the risks.\n\nAsked for comment, Novo Nordisk did not address her individual case but has generally refuted such allegations. Wegovy currently warns it may cause “serious side effects” including conditions such as thyroid tumors, pancreatitis, gallbladder problems, depression and “severe stomach problems.”\n\nMcClain’s suit is among the latest to join about 3,200 federal challenges, which are in addition to more than 1,200 lawsuits against Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in state courts in New Jersey, Indiana and Delaware. The plaintiffs in these state cases range in age from 18 to 87 and are from at least 44 U.S. states, USA TODAY found.\n\nUSA TODAY reviewed a random sample of 100 of the thousands of federal lawsuits to learn more about the patients suing these companies. The majority are women – about two-thirds of the plaintiffs in USA TODAY’s sample. They skew older than the average American with a median age of 52, but the patients sampled ranged in age from 26 to 75.\n\nAbout a quarter of the plaintiffs reported using multiple weight-loss drugs. Almost three-fourths used Ozempic, a quarter used Trulicity and 17% used Mounjaro. Other weight-loss drugs were mentioned in just a handful of cases.\n\nThe federal multidistrict litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania focusing on gastrointestinal injury is currently in the pre-trial phase. Plaintiffs attorneys said that includes evaluating common issues such as the testing that is needed to prove the plaintiff had gastroparesis; whether or not the companies’ drug warnings are adequate as a matter of law; and the ability of medications to cause each of the harms plaintiffs have alleged.\n\nIn December 2025, a separate multidistrict litigation grouping was created under the same federal judge for lawsuits alleging vision injuries. Other state cases are continuing independently.\n\nAn Eli Lilly spokesperson noted that “the federal court presiding over these claims ruled last summer that ‘any plaintiff claiming to have had drug-induced gastroparesis must have had a gastric emptying study … properly performed at the time of diagnosis,’ confirming the diagnosis, and it recognized that its ruling meant some plaintiffs ‘will be unable to prove that they suffered from gastroparesis.’ Lilly appreciates the Court’s careful consideration of this and other threshold issues, and we will continue to defend against these claims in court.”\n\nThe first \"bellwether” test trials are not expected until 2027, plaintiffs’ attorneys said. Such consolidated cases often last 4-5 years, said Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a University of Georgia law professor who is an expert in multidistrict litigation.\n\nThe challenges come as an increasing number of Americans turn to the class of drugs, which were first used to help control blood sugar levels for diabetic patients about two decades ago.\n\n“These drugs are not new,” said Ziyad Al-Aly, who directs research and development at the St. Louis’ Veterans Affairs Health Care System. “What’s new about them is that the companies then realized, ‘Oh my God, they actually work on weight loss.’”\n\nWhen Ozempic began being used off-label for weight loss, Novo Nordisk also developed Wegovy for weight loss, with Eli Lilly releasing Mounjaro and Trulicity. Demand also fueled a market of compounding pharmacies using similar ingredients.\n\nGLP-1 prescriptions shot up from about 1 million at the start of 2018 to about 9 million in 2022, according to the analytics firm Trilliant Health. The usage of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy doubled between 2024 and 2025, according to one Gallup study.\n\nThat growth has been fueled by high-profile celebrities, influencers and word-of-mouth, with more states fully covering GLP-1s for obesity treatment under Medicaid. It’s expected to rise further with a newly introduced pill version of the class of drug. And research has shown promise that the drugs may aid a range of conditions.\n\nOne study that Al-Aly helped conduct and published in Nature Medicine in early 2025 compared the effects of GLP-1 medications to other types of treatment in dozens of health outcomes. In addition to GLP-1s’ now well-known ability to treat diabetes and obesity, Al-Aly and his team found connections between GLP-1 use and reduced risk of substance use disorders, suicidal ideation, seizures, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, among many others.\n\nOn the other hand, Al-Aly points out no medicine is risk-free.\n\nTheir study confirmed GLP-1s increased the risk of nausea, vomiting, kidney stones, sleep disturbances and other gastrointestinal problems. Al-Aly said he sympathizes with the plaintiffs of these lawsuits, but overall he believes the drugs’ benefits outweigh the risks for most patients. He advises his patients to pay close attention to how their bodies react to GLP-1 medications and bring up any concerns so they can revisit the dose or try another medication.\n\n“That's the reality of life. There is nothing that’s really all benefit and no risk. There's no medicine like that,” Al-Aly said.\n\nBut McClain’s lawsuit alleges that the drug manufacturer downplayed the risks.\n\n“I read everything I could find on it before I went on it,” she said, “and I knew that there was nausea and some problems with slowing down your digestive system and things like that, but they did not warn about any of the stuff that happened to me at that time.”\n\nWhen Mark Smith returned home to Lake Charles, Louisiana, from a weekslong stint as a cook serving offshore oil-rig workers in late-August of 2023, he could tell something was wrong.\n\nHis wife, Robin Smith, 62, who had been ill, seemed confused, struggling to make a phone call or use a TV remote, he told USA TODAY in an interview.\n\nSince late July, she’d had stomach problems and had been vomiting frequently. She’d started taking Mounjaro for weight loss the previous fall. Until then, she’d experienced little stomach upset as her weight fell to under 200 pounds from 285.\n\nHer daughter, Angel Smith Wirsing, said she took her to the hospital twice with vomiting and weakness. After earlier reducing her dose, her doctor suggested she stop taking the weight-loss drug. She did so, but her gastric problems persisted, according to her attorney, Todd Townsley.\n\nUpon his return from work, Mark took her to a local hospital. She was diagnosed as having gastroparesis and ileus, Townsley said.\n\nDays later, Smith was transferred to a New Orleans medical center. There, doctors determined she was suffering from Wernicke's encephalopathy, a neurological condition caused by a deficiency of thiamine, or Vitamin B1, often linked to malnutrition.\n\nDespite infusions of thiamine, Mark said, her encephalopathy appeared to become permanent.\n\nMark has since quit his job to help care for Robin, who regained her former 285-pound weight after she stopped taking Mounjaro. She struggles to walk and suffers from confusion and memory loss. At times she doesn’t recognize her husband. She could not participate in an interview about her experience, her husband, daughter and attorney told USA TODAY.\n\n“I still have my wife, physically, not mentally anymore,” said Mark Smith.\n\nSmith filed a lawsuit in November of 2023, alleging: “As a result of using Defendant’s Mounjaro, Plaintiff was caused to suffer from gastroparesis, which resulted in, among other things, development of Wernicke’s encephalopathy.”\n\nWhile Eli Lilly has not responded directly in court to their case, it has noted in other filings that Mounjaro labels have always warned that it may be associated with \"severe\" gastrointestinal reactions.\n\nBut Robin Smith’s daughter, who like her mother has stopped taking the drug and gained back the weight she lost, said she believes Eli Lilly didn’t provide a full picture of how severe even rare risks could get.\n\n“I know she would have never taken it if she would’ve known this,” she said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: GLP-1 weight-loss drug lawsuits allege serious side effects",

    "description": "Chloe Lee, a financial advisor, describes how solo surf camp trips in Bali boosted her confidence and built global friendships.",
    "fullText": "I met Chloe Lee after a sunset yoga class on a wooden deck inside our surf camp in Bali, Indonesia. She spun around excitedly when she heard me tell someone I was from Singapore too, and we bombarded each other with questions.\n\nLater that evening, at a Friday-night barbecue, the 22-year-old financial advisor told me it was her fifth visit to the camp. It explained why she knew every staff member, the two camp cats, and the fluffy white camp dog by name. We passed around lemongrass-scented bug spray and chatted about why young people like us are drawn to adventure sports.\n\nOver poke bowls after an intense surf session, we caught up again and talked about what kept bringing her back to the island.\n\nOur chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Lee's words.\n\nMy introduction to surfing was through my partner, who told me about it in late 2023. We took a surf trip with some of our friends, and when I tried it, I actually enjoyed it. It was really scary, but I was surprised that I could stand up and catch some waves.\n\nIt took me one more trip — this time in Bali — before I decided that I definitely wanted to do this again.\n\nIn 2024, I had been working at JPMorgan for a year and felt very burned out. I decided to go on my first solo trip and chose to go surfing. I picked Bali again because it was close to home, and I did tons of research on different surf camps before settling on one. I wanted to improve at surfing, but a key criterion was also being able to meet new people.\n\nThese trips can be expensive, and taking days off means losing the commission I earn from onboarding new clients. But the mindset among Gen Z is shifting. It's about seeing things on Instagram and TikTok and using your adult money to treat yourself and do something your parents didn't dare to do before.\n\nI've visited this camp four times since my first solo trip. One reason that keeps drawing me back is the instructors, their technique, and the familiarity I have built with them.\n\nI really enjoy the community, hostel-like environment of the surf camp. I know that even if I come by myself, I will have a good time with other people. I've brought other friends and my partner since, and we always have a group to hang out with.\n\nI love that I stay in touch with the other surfers, most of whom live across the world. I can always follow influencers and see how people in different places live, but this feels so much more personal. I've also become close friends with several people from Singapore who are here. We play pickleball together, and one of them has even become my client.\n\nSurfing isn't popular in Singapore, and I feel like I've found people I can share my new hobby with. We have a group chat and send each other memes or content related to surfing, something my main group of friends can't relate to. Picking this up has also helped me bond with new people I meet back home, since most people are surprised to find someone who surfs regularly.\n\nMy surf trips are unlike any other travel experience — I feel like I'm truly on a getaway, rather than when I'm on trips where sightseeing, shopping, or food are the focus. I've realized that I don't interact with anybody else on regular trips. Here, I'm constantly engaging with people over meals or while we're in the water.\n\nIt's also so different from any other sport I've tried. I'm fully immersed when I'm in the water — I'm not thinking about work or anything back home. My attention is on catching the right waves, making my turns better, and avoiding injuries.\n\nI'm a very risk-averse person, and I still get scuffed surfing. However, the end result is so fulfilling that the element of danger feels worthwhile. For me, it's the adrenaline high of knowing I'm doing something that I thought I could not.\n\nTelling people I surf makes me feel proud and cool, like I'm doing something different. So many people have also asked me to bring them along when I go next.\n\nAnother thing I love about these trips is that I'm getting my body moving and being active, especially since I didn't do a lot of exercise back home.\n\nSurfing is physically demanding, and it's forced me to watch my health more. I never thought I'd try yoga until I realized I needed a lot of hip mobility and flexibility to improve my surfing. I've signed up for yoga classes and now go regularly back home.\n\nIt's also an escape from the bustle and stress back home, where people are obsessed with talking about work and LinkedIn milestones. When I come here, conversations are different. I've met tech founders, digital nomads, and people who are traveling full time.\n\nSurfing has also given me confidence and changed my mindset about a few things. It reminded me that I can do hard things and that I enjoy being uncomfortable. Waiting for waves has also taught me how to be patient and be aware of timing, which has translated into how I live and my relationships back home.\n\nI want to try more, maybe snowboarding next.",

    "description": "Reid Hoffman says business leaders are wrong to stay silent and that they have a responsibility to speak up.",
    "fullText": "Business leaders who believe staying quiet about the Trump administration will protect their companies are making a dangerous miscalculation, says Reid Hoffman.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder and tech investor said in an episode of the \"Rapid Response\" podcast published Tuesday that he rejects the idea that executives can simply wait out political turbulence.\n\n\"The theory that if you just keep your mouth shut, the storm will blow over and it won't be a problem — you should be disabused of that theory now,\" Hoffman said.\n\nHoffman is a longtime Democratic donor and one of Silicon Valley's most outspoken political voices. He has backed Democratic candidates and causes for years and has publicly clashed with pro-Trump business leaders, including the White House AI czar, David Sacks.\n\nIn 2024, Hoffman contributed $2 million to a super PAC that spearheaded a write-in campaign for President Joe Biden in New Hampshire.\n\nHoffman said fear of retaliation from the Trump administration has made many business leaders hesitant to speak publicly, but fear is exactly the wrong guide. Executives should speak out instead of rationalizing that \"it's the right thing for my business,\" he added.\n\nHoffman framed public engagement as a responsibility that comes with wealth and power.\n\n\"Human beings first,\" he said. \"Humanity, society, right, you are members of both of those.\"\n\n\"Anyone who's wealthy in the society should be extremely grateful for being part of the society. You have responsibilities,\" he added.\n\nHoffman said he is \"regularly called out by the White House\" and added that it should not be punitive for leaders to speak based on their knowledge and experience.\n\n\"Precisely when you feel fear, you should think about, is this a time for courage?\" he said.\n\n\"We need to be speaking up, and we need to be figuring out how to solve our problems together,\" he added.\n\nHoffman's comments come as some business and tech leaders have broken their silence over the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis and the broader immigration crackdown under the Trump administration.\n\nPretti's death — the second killing by federal officers within weeks — has drawn sharp public debate over federal enforcement tactics and accountability.\n\nSome business and tech leaders reacted strongly. Google DeepMind's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, wrote in response to a video of the shooting on X that \"this is absolutely shameful.\"\n\n\"Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,\" he wrote. \"Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.\"\n\nOthers have joined in, including former Meta chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun. LeCun bluntly labelled the footage of the shooting \"Murderers.\"\n\nA group of more than 60 Minnesota-based CEOs signed a letter on Sunday urging \"de-escalation\" and collaboration among state, local, and federal officials to \"work together to find real solutions.\"\n\nOther CEOs have remained quiet on the issue. Business Insider's Peter Kafka wrote Tuesday that business leaders have several reasons for staying silent, including concern that the Trump administration has made it clear it is willing to pressure or punish companies that don't bend to its will.",

    "description": "The LVMH CEO started an earnings call with, \"I think we'll make it through the winter.\"",
    "fullText": "LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault started a Tuesday earnings call with some dry humor, telling investors that his company will see the end of winter.\n\nThe French luxury tycoon, who is worth $197 billion, announced the company's full-year 2025 results during a call with investors.\n\n\"I'm delighted to present to you the figures for 2025, to begin with a good piece of news,\" he said. \"I think we'll make it through the winter.\"\n\nHe said that LVMH's results were \"solid\" in a challenging geopolitical and economic climate, and the company has \"managed to get through this period.\"\n\n\"2026 won't be simple either, but one thing at a time,\" he added. Arnault has been the luxury giant's CEO since 1989.\n\nThe group posted revenue of €80.8 billion, or about $96.9 billion, in 2025, a 5% decline from 2024. Of this, its wine and spirits division took the largest hit, with sales down 9% from 2024.\n\nLVMH has seen its revenue growth slow down in recent years. In 2020, it was hit hard by the COVID pandemic, seeing its annual revenue drop 17% compared to 2019. Business picked back up in 2021, where it saw a 44% revenue increase compared to 2020.\n\nHowever, the luxury slump that followed has since taken a toll on the business, as aspirational customers cut down on luxury purchases, squeezed by inflation after the pandemic. Luxury customers in China, one of LVMH's most important markets, were hit by a real-estate-linked economic crisis and reined in their spending.\n\nLVMH's sales went into the red in 2024, when it reported a 2% revenue dip compared to 2023.\n\nAnd last year, it faced a new challenge: President Donald Trump's tariffs. Company executives said in May last year that prices for some of its premium goods could increase 2 to 3% to offset the tariffs.\n\nIt's not just LVMH that is suffering from the luxury slump. The upscale US department store company, Saks Global, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 13, owing millions to luxury companies Kering, Chanel, and Capri Holdings.\n\nRepresentatives for LVMH did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

You could go work somewhere else,'\" Max Junestrand said.\n\nThe Swedish startup competes with San Francisco-based Harvey, which has a valuation of $8 billion.\n\n\"I try to create missionaries, not mercenaries,\" Junestrand said, referring to an analogy coined by Kleiner Perkins venture capitalist John Doerr years ago. \"And I think we've successfully done that.\"\n\nAt the time, Doerr explained that mercenaries work for themselves and start companies to flip them, while missionaries are focused on working for a team and thinking about the long term.\n\nThe Legora CEO, who cofounded the startup in 2023, said he looks for people with \"raw grit\" who don't mind late hours. He said his staff has dinner in the office at 8 p.m., and the company signed deals on New Year's Eve.\n\nAt the company's Christmas dinner, they served mulled wine — and KPIs.\n\n\"We had the big sales dashboard in front of us at the wine thing, and everybody kept looking at it, because everybody wants momentum,\" he said.\n\nLegora has 300 employees, and it plans to double the team's size during the first half of this year. A Legora representative told Business Insider that the company's head count doubled in the last six months.\n\nLegora is among a handful of European startups reviving excitement in the region's entrepreneurship and venture capital scene. Compared to their American counterparts, European companies have traditionally faced investor skepticism for being slow, overcommitted to work-life balance, and heavily tied by regulation.\n\nSwedish vibe coding startup Lovable, French frontier AI lab Mistral, and recently listed Swedish fintech Klarna are among other names driving the push.",

    "fullText": "Prediction markets are getting a bad rap amid concerns about insider trading. Now, some of them are fighting back.\n\nThe Coalition for Prediction Markets, which includes companies like Kalshi, Coinbase, and Robinhood, took out a full-page ad in the Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nThe ad highlights the companies' support for a ban on insider trading on prediction market platforms and calls on Congress to work with them to \"keep prediction markets safe and transparent.\"\n\n\"CFTC regulated prediction markets (already) ban insider trading,\" the ad reads.\n\nA spokesperson for the coalition told Business Insider the ad is the \"opening salvo\" in a coming PR blitz pushing for the codification of federal regulation for prediction markets — a key goal for the companies, as regulators in some states seek to clamp down on the burgeoning industry.\n\n\"The coalition plans to spend seven figures in the coming months in coordination with its government relations outreach,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe PR campaign comes after a trader on Polymarket made more than $400,000 off of a well-timed bet on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's political future just hours before his capture by US forces.\n\nThat's led to greater scrutiny of prediction markets broadly, along with a new proposed bill to formally ban insider trading by government officials who might have access to sensitive information.\n\nIn the wake of that trade, Kalshi has sought to distinguish itself from Polymarket, which was banned from serving US users from 2022 to 2025 and only recently gained approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nPolymarket is not a member of the Coalition for Prediction Markets, and the group's spokesperson said that the ad is meant to draw \"a clear contrast with offshore platforms where concerning scandals such as the Maduro trade have occurred.\" A Polymarket spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company, which has signed partnerships with the Wall Street Journal and the Golden Globes, hasn't made any public statements about the Maduro trade controversy.

    "description": "Waymo robotaxi is closing the gap on pricing and wait times next to Uber and Lyft — key metrics riders factor in when choosing a ride, a study found.",
    "fullText": "Waymo's robotaxis are getting more competitive with Uber and Lyft as the autonomous vehicle service closes the gap on pricing and wait times in San Francisco, while Tesla undercuts everyone on price, a first-ever study comparing all four platforms showed.\n\nObi, a ride-hailing price aggregator, on Tuesday published a study that provides a snapshot into the state of the ride-hailing competition in the San Francisco Bay Area, a major hub for autonomous vehicles and traditional ride-hailing services.\n\nWaymo's robotaxi service is not only closing the price gap with Uber and Lyft but also competing better on wait times; both factors — price and long ETAs — were among the highest-cited issues consumers had with ride-hailing companies in general, according to a survey Obi conducted as part of the study.\n\nObi's June 2025 study on Waymo found prices 30% to 40% higher than those of Uber and Lyft. This latest report, conducted between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, shows Waymo is now an \"average of 12.7% more expensive than an Uber and 27.3% more expensive than a Lyft.\"\n\nWaymo also appears to be competing better on wait times with the two ride-hailing giants, according to the study. Over a 24-hour period, Obi's data showed that Waymo's ETAs better matched Uber's and Lyft's, except at peak demand times around 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., when Waymo's wait times spiked.\n\nWaymo's average ETA was 5.74 minutes, whereas Lyft's was 5.14 minutes, and Uber's was 3.15 minutes.\n\n\"That's the biggest change to me,\" Ashwini Anburajan, CEO of Obi, told Business Insider. \"It's the convergence in price as well as the reduced wait times because now you can actually compare them. It's a more honest comparison between the three platforms.\"\n\nObi's report also looked at Tesla Robotaxi, the newest entrant in the Bay Area's ride-hailing market, and found that it had the longest wait times by far, with an average ETA of 15.32 minutes. However, the study found that it beat every competitor on pricing.\n\n\"Obi's data shows that the price for a Tesla robotaxi ride in San Francisco rarely exceeds $10, averaging $8.17 vs. the next cheapest option, Lyft, which averages $15.47,\" the report said. \"That's a staggering $7.30 average price variance.\"\n\nAnburajan told Business Insider that Tesla's pricing is reminiscent of Uber and Lyft in the early days.\n\n\"They're using the playbook that Uber and Lyft used when they first came into the market — dramatically lower pricing, undercutting what's existing in the market, and really just driving adoption, driving downloads, driving people to use the app,\" Anburajan said. \"And we know that playbook works.\"\n\nFor the Obi CEO, Tesla's wait times are the difference between a nascent service and a serious ride-hailing competitor.\n\n\"I don't think people realize how critical wait times are in selecting a robotaxi or a regular rideshare,\" Anburajan said. \"They're a huge factor in how people decide.\"\n\nAn Uber spokesperson declined to comment. Spokespeople for Lyft, Waymo, and Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nObi's findings are a snapshot from a limited window, as prices and wait times can swing with seasonality. Still, the study captures how the Bay Area market is shifting: Tesla is buying demand with lower fares, while Waymo is increasingly looking less like a premium service and more like a viable substitute for Uber and Lyft.\n\nThe data on Waymo tracks with the company's recent expansion in November, when the company increased its robotaxi fleet from 800 cars to more than 1,000.\n\nObi's survey suggests consumer attitudes on autonomous vehicles are changing, too. Nearly half, or 48.3%, of respondents said they expect autonomous vehicles to be their main rideshare — up from 24% in June.\n\n\"I think that the novelty of riding a robotaxi or an autonomous vehicle has started to wear off in the San Francisco market, and I think that's a good thing,\" Anburjan said. \"More people trust the cars now.\"",

The vehicle eventually came to a stop after crashing into the back of another car.\n\nThe crash happened at about 11 a.m. on Sunday in the 1200 block of Lilac Place near Dodger Stadium, per KTLA's report. No injuries were reported.\n\nA Waymo spokesperson said the vehicle was being manually driven by an autonomous vehicle specialist at the time of the crash. There were no other riders inside the car.\n\nThe driver exited the vehicle on his own following the crash, the spokesperson added.\n\nWhile Waymo's robotaxis are designed to operate without a human driver, the company still uses manual driving in certain situations, including software testing and training.\n\nIn some cases, trained specialists sit in the driver's seat to \"monitor our autonomous driving technology,\" Waymo said on its FAQ page.\n\nWaymo began operating a driverless ride-hailing service in Phoenix in 2018 and has since expanded to other cities, including Austin and Atlanta, through a partnership with Uber.\n\nThe company launched driverless vehicles in San Francisco in 2022 and began offering rides to the public through its app in 2024.\n\nThe crash comes as Waymo faces increased scrutiny over the safety of its autonomous vehicles.\n\nLast month, several Waymo robotaxis stalled in intersections and along busy streets in San Francisco during a power outage. A clip on X showed at least five driverless vehicles clustered at a junction, backing up traffic.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission told Business Insider in December it is \"looking into specifics\" of the outage incident.\n\nIn May, Waymo recalled software affecting more than 1,200 vehicles after some slammed into chains or gates.

Meanwhile, Vermont shrank 0.3%, due to more deaths than births and more people moving out elsewhere in the US than moving in from other areas of the country.\n\nA Census Bureau news release said that the overall population increased in each of the four regions, but the Midwest was the only one where every state climbed.\n\n\"From July 2024 through June 2025, the Midwest also saw positive net domestic migration for the first time this decade,\" Marc Perry, senior demographer at the Census Bureau, said per the news release.\n\nPerry added that while more people moving in from elsewhere in the US than leaving for somewhere else in the country was modest in the Midwest, \"this is still a notable turnaround\" from previous losses.\n\nThe US population increased by just 0.5%, the lowest uptick since 2021. The Census Bureau's Christine Hartley said this was mainly because net international migration — the number of people who moved into the US rather than out — plunged to 1.3 million from 2.7 million.\n\nJed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in a Substack post that net international migration last year was higher than where it stood in the 2010s and doesn't reflect all the immigration changes the Trump administration made since President Donald Trump took office again, since the estimate stops at the summer.\n\nNineteen states and Washington, DC, had more people moving out of them to somewhere else in the US than people moving in from other areas of the country. When adjusted for population size, New York, Hawaii, and Alaska were most affected.",

    "description": "Housing forecasters are expecting more buyers and sellers to make moves in 2026 after last year's false start. Here's why sales could soon pick up.",
    "fullText": "It was supposed to be the year that America's real estate market came back to life — until it wasn't.\n\nEver since the Federal Reserve jacked up borrowing rates to fight inflation in 2022, real estate agents, economists, and politicians of all stripes have grumbled about the sluggish pace of home sales and the market's steep price of admission. But near the end of 2024, housing prognosticators began reporting signs of a thaw: Mortgage rates had hit two-year lows, affordability appeared to be improving, and there were finally a few more options for buyers. 2025 was poised to be the comeback year for homebuying.\n\n\"All the ingredients were there for a more robust recovery,\" Kara Ng, a senior economist at Zillow, tells me. \"And it just didn't happen.\"\n\nIt's no mystery why. President Donald Trump's trade war, combined with a tepid labor market and a bump in mortgage rates, led many potential movers to stay put. Those who had a job or a cheap home loan held onto those things for dear life. Buyers balked at prices. Home sales last year remained disappointingly flat.\n\nIt's a new year, though, and housing forecasters and real estate agents are once again humming a hopeful tune.\n\n\"The data right now is suggesting there's more demand,\" says Ethan Flynn, an agent in the Nashville area. \"I'm optimistic.\"\n\nDespite a recent spike in mortgage rates, thanks to Trump's short-lived, Greenland-inspired tariff threats, there are legitimate signs of sunnier days ahead for real estate. Three key factors — prices, available inventory, and yes, even mortgage rates — support the tentative optimism. The recent data has been enough for a pair of economists to proclaim this the year of The Great Housing Reset, anticipating conditions that could spur more buyers and sellers to shake off the cobwebs and make moves.\n\nGiven last year's false start, it's fair to be skeptical that this time is any different. Maybe everyone's just scrounging for good news to beat back the January malaise. Maybe they're gluttons for punishment with boundless appetites for prediction whiffs. Maybe I'm falling into the same trap as I try to counter a barrage of doom-and-gloom headlines with good tidings. Or maybe, just maybe, the market is actually heating up.\n\nAt risk of jinxing it all, here are the reasons to be hopeful about homebuying in 2026.\n\nPredicting mortgage rates is a fool's errand — just ask anyone who was confident the typical rate would slip under 6% last year. Agents and economists keep trying, though, because mortgage rates are among the most important factors holding up the market. Buyers and sellers are especially sensitive to the kinds of big swings that we've seen over the past few years. When rates plummeted in 2021, many rushed to lock up loans in the 3% range or lower, fueling the buying frenzy. Then the rate hikes a couple of years later prompted both buyers and sellers to pump the brakes. These moves have solidified the state of play since: Lots of people holding onto the mortgages they got a few years ago, or holding off until borrowing money gets cheaper.\n\nGiven their central role in the affordability picture, it's no wonder that everyone in the real estate industry is trying to read the mortgage-rate tea leaves. Thankfully for hopeful buyers (and their agents), the trend over the past few months points to sweeter deals on the horizon. Rates have ticked down to around 6.2%, more than half a percentage point lower than a year ago. That kind of dip could save buyers hundreds of dollars a month on interest payments. Assuming you got the average mortgage rate and put down 20% on the typical home, your monthly housing costs would be about $177 cheaper than the peak in October 2023, a Zillow analysis found. The savings pile up even higher in pricier cities.\n\nBeyond dreams of lower rates, the march of time also means that people are more likely to make a move this year. As the rock-bottom rates of 2021 fade further into the rearview mirror, people start to get accustomed to the current levels. While buyers and sellers may still be pining for those bygone loans, they can only hold out for so long. And as life milestones, like getting married or having kids, inevitably crop up, people are more likely to suck it up and make a move.\n\n\"Buyers and sellers have begrudgingly come to terms that you're not going to get 3% rates anytime soon,\" Ng tells me, \"and they're moving on with their lives.\"\n\nWhile the overall market remained stuck in place last year, homebuyers who did try their luck enjoyed at least one bright spot: more choices. With homes taking longer to sell and homeowners inevitably having to move, active inventory — or the number of houses on the market — increased by about 30% year-over-year in May and June, according to Realtor.com. The encouraging news came with a couple of caveats, though. While active inventory leaped past pre-COVID levels in softer markets like Austin and Tampa — and prices dropped accordingly — the nationwide pool of available homes continues to lag 2019 levels. The inventory boom has also cooled off since that summer peak: The number of active listings in December was up just 12% from the year prior, per Realtor.com, and remained 12.5% below the average December levels from 2017 to 2019.\n\nBuyers still have more choices than at any point in the post-COVID era, though it remains to be seen how many for-sale signs make their way to front yards this spring. Sellers have historically been pretty resistant to slashing prices in the face of lukewarm interest or more competition — as we saw over the summer, many simply yanked their home off the market and resolved to test the waters another time. They may only be able to stave off a move for so long, though.\n\n\"Some of those folks are growing less patient, and so prices slowly start to ease down,\" says Mike Simonsen, the chief economist at the brokerage firm Compass and founder of Altos Research. \"This is really the culmination of four years of rising inventory, four years of sellers waiting and hoping that prices would appreciate.\"\n\nThis year probably won't deliver much drama in home prices, which should be welcome news for both buyers and sellers. Wild swings in home values, either up or down, usually aren't good for buyer morale. Even if home shoppers are rooting for more affordability, plummeting prices would likely signal bigger problems in the economy — the kinds of stuff, like mass layoffs or financial turmoil, that prompt buyers to pump the brakes.\n\nThe national median price ended the year basically flat — Redfin reported just a 0.4% year-over-year increase in December. The placid overall number obscures some interregional variations: Prices have been falling slightly in much of the lower half of the US, or Sun Belt, and rising in the Northeast and Midwest, where there's relatively more demand and fewer homes for sale. For 2025, most economists are forecasting a modest home-price increase in the low single digits. Zillow, for example, expects the national median to rise by a little less than 2% this year, which should give incomes the chance to grow faster than home values. Redfin also projects just a 1% increase. Bear in mind, though, that your local market may shift to a greater degree, depending on how many homes are piling up for sale.\n\nThe reason for this muted growth is simple: Economists aren't seeing anything in the data that would indicate a sudden surge or crash. Affordability may be loosening, but the cost of homebuying hasn't eased enough to trigger a cascade of interest, and while inventories are growing, there hasn't been a trigger for people to dump their homes willy-nilly. Daryl Fairweather and Chen Zhao, economists at Redfin, have dubbed this the year of The Great Housing Reset, with wage growth finally expected to outpace home-price increases. That could make homebuying more appealing if sustained over a few years. It's not the kind of sudden shift that would open the floodgates, but again, modest growth is preferable to wild swings in either direction.\n\n\"The whole experience for people, even if they've done it many times, it's stressful,\" says Phil Crescenzo Jr., vice president of the Southeast division at Nation One Mortgage. \"You want the market to be boring.\"\n\nChewing over this story, Crescenzo's line stuck with me: Boring is better. After the tumult of the pandemic-era housing market, a little nothing-to-see-here might be exactly what's needed for buyers and sellers to take the plunge.\n\nEven the economists forecasting a pickup aren't getting ahead of themselves. Simonsen, for example, expects just a 5% increase in home sales volume. That may not sound like a lot, but it would represent more than 200,000 additional sales, given that roughly 4.05 million existing homes traded hands last year. You won't find mortgage loan officers dancing in the streets, or lines at open houses stretching down the block like they used to. Homebuying without the hysteria, however, should be welcomed by people on both sides of the closing table.\n\nThat doesn't mean this year will be worry-free. The big concern among real estate gurus I spoke to is the prospect that buyers won't return to the market as hoped, either because of lingering affordability concerns or, more worryingly, the kind of broader economic uncertainty that keeps people stuck in place. If that's the case, we may have bigger issues on our hands than a middling housing market.\n\n\"Prices are lower, there are more options, and you have lower mortgage rates,\" Flynn, the agent in Nashville, tells me. \"If you can't get more demand with all of that happening, then that, to me, is a very big problem.\"\n\nJames Rodriguez is a correspondent on Business Insider's Discourse team.",

    "description": "\"For Love & Money\" answers your relationship and money questions. This week, a reader asks how to deal with friends' comments about money problems.",
    "fullText": "I am wealthy, and my friends always hint about their money problems. When I travel, I don't tell them, but if they know, they resent it.\n\nIt is difficult to deal with people who have no budget or plan for their money. I inherited money and invested it. I also worked and invested. Why can't they do the same?\n\nI am not a bank. I donate to nonprofits for worthy causes. I am generous. But dealing with friends is difficult. And loaning money is losing the friendship. I don't know what to do. Please tell me ways to say NO.\n\nFirst off, I want to thank you for writing in. Given the state of the economy, I'm sure you know the general response to your predicament will be a collective groan, so choosing to share your experience and seek advice anyway was a brave thing to do.\n\nMoney can be a sensitive topic among friends and even strain relationships. I've been on both sides of the issue at different times in my life.\n\nI've been the poor friend passively trying to redirect my friend group's vacation plans to a local winery when everyone else was getting excited about Cancún, and I've been the friend with money pretending not to notice a pal's insinuation that because I make more than they do, I should pick up the tab. Both situations were awkward and unpleasant.\n\nWhen I was the poor friend, I didn't know how to tell my richer friends that I couldn't afford our annual girls' trip without feeling embarrassed and ashamed. As the friend with money, I was worried my boundaries would end friendships I didn't want to lose.\n\nHaving seen both sides, I recognize empathy is the key to maintaining friendships no matter what side of the socioeconomic divide you're on.\n\nYou wrote that you don't tell your friends about your travels and that when they find out, they resent it. I find myself wondering what that resentment looks like. Are they making angry accusations that you ought to have brought them along for the ride? If so, to be perfectly frank, I don't think your friends are worth keeping. Or, at the very least, there are deeper-rooted boundaries that need to be set to keep your friendship healthy — we'll get into that more later.\n\nOr, is it good-natured ribbing with a side of passive aggression, or maybe a more straightforward grumbled \"must be nice\"? If either of these two options more closely resembles your situation, I think you should try a little empathy.\n\nNo one likes snide digs and bitter asides, but your perspective on your friends' financial straits — and asking why they can't just \"do the same\" as what you did — tells me that you're harboring a lot of resentment of your own.\n\nYou were literally born into money — something that isn't the case for most people. Since then, it sounds like you've made several smart financial moves that have increased your wealth, which is great. You don't have to apologize for either of those things, but to ignore the huge advantage your upbringing gave you and judge your friends, who sound like they may come from different financial backgrounds, for not achieving your level of financial success is disengenuous.\n\nInstead of asking, \"Why can't they do the same thing I did?\" try asking yourself, \"How would it feel if I had financial struggles to the point of not being able to afford a vacation, and then I saw photos of my rich friend jet-setting across the globe?\" If you're honest, the answer is probably something along the lines of a curled lip and an envious \"must be nice.\"\n\nThese are your friends. You care about them deeply, to the point of stressing over how a wrong move might cost you the relationship. Sometimes they might need to roll their eyes after you mention your vacation to Maui, and mutter something about how long it's been since they saw the ocean. That doesn't mean it won't hurt your feelings, but try to keep their digs in perspective.\n\nThat said, one of the best ways to curb their snark is for you to address it head-on. When you have money, and your friends don't, drawing attention to it may feel like a terrible idea. But as someone who has been the poor friend at times, let me tell you — my friends having more money than I do has never bothered me, but when they pretend they don't? My aggravation can't be overstated.\n\nFor instance, if your friend says, \"Must be nice,\" acknowledge the truth of it without rubbing their face in it. Respond in the same off-hand tone they used with a simple, \"Yeah, I don't hate it.\" You have money, they don't. If you want to maintain the friendship, the answer isn't to tiptoe around this fact, but to accept and acknowledge it for the reality that it is.\n\nUltimately, this situation comes down to your boundaries.\n\nThe first step to establishing healthy boundaries is figuring out what you want them to look like. Ask yourself what you need from your friends, but also what you can offer them. Once you have clear answers to these questions, think about what parameters you can erect to cultivate these preferred dynamics.\n\nYou mentioned feeling like loaning money means losing the friendship. This feels like a straightforward and perfectly reasonable boundary. You can hold this boundary by being honest and saying something like, \"I'm sorry, but I don't loan money to friends. I've seen how easily it can cause misunderstandings and weird power differentials. But, I'd love to help you some other way.\"\n\nHaving a personal practice for helping your friends is another boundary you can implement that will allow you to acknowledge your financial advantages while supporting them in ways you feel comfortable.\n\nPerhaps you don't feel like you should have to help your friends out financially, but you could offer your friends investment or budgeting tips, write them reference letters, or help them figure out their finances if they're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nYou could also give to them generously — not as a favor, but in the form of no-strings-attached gifts. For instance, you could surprise your friend who likes to treat you with baked goods with a stand mixer, or a friend who included you in their fantasy league with a ticket to join you at a game. There are plenty of ways to help your friends besides cash loans.\n\nSo, there you have it: my permission to stand by your boundaries. Your friends' lives are their own, your life is your own, and your friendship isn't a transaction — it's a connection. That connection does not require you to financially contribute to your friends' lives, but it does necessitate that you view them and their situations with empathy and, if you feel you have the capacity, think about how you can show up for them in other ways.\n\nThis article was originally published in June 2022.\n\nLooking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships?

    "fullText": "The race to build the \"agentic internet\" is on, with consumers expected to increasingly offload tasks like travel and grocery shopping to autonomous software. It presents brands with a new challenge: how to stand out when the customer is an AI agent rather than a human.\n\nFounded in New York in 2024, Limy has built a platform to help companies better understand how AI agents decide which brands and products to recommend to their users.\n\nLimy is set to announce on Wednesday that it has raised $10 million in seed funding led by venture capital firm Flybridge. A16z's Speedrun program, Axiom, Clarim, JRV, AnD, and Communitas also participated.\n\nLimy plugs into a brand's content delivery network, such as Cloudflare, to detect when an AI agent visits their website. It then analyzes which content the agent fetched and the prompt a user entered into a chatbot like ChatGPT or Gemini that triggered the visit.\n\nArmed with that information, Limy produces insights for brands about the types of prompts that are surfacing their products in AI answers and whether the agent's visit to their website led to a purchase. Brands can apply those insights to help boost their visibility within large language models. Limy makes money through a tiered subscription model based on a company's size and the capabilities it requires.\n\nAviv Shamny, Limy's CEO, told Business Insider in an interview that his company differs from other startups offering generative engine optimization services because these competitor analytics tools typically track human clicks and pageviews.\n\nAgents are \"going in through the pipes,\" he said. \"They behave completely differently.\"\n\nShamny said connecting website visits from agents to real business metrics is a \"complicated vector search process,\" which helps set Limy up to be a player as advertising gets introduced to AI chatbots.\n\nOpenAI announced this month that it is testing ads on ChatGPT. Google last year introduced ads to the AI Overviews on its search results page and within its AI Mode, which allows users to ask follow-up questions.\n\n\"We're right at that junction between what agents are looking for, why they're surfacing ads, how these ads are even being interpreted by these agents,\" and whether those ads will lead to an eventual sale, Shamny said.\n\nTying a prompt to a conversion means Limy could tell a brand like Nike that the prompt \"best running shoes for men running a marathon\" had generated $10 million in sales over a quarter, and that this is the type of prompt or topic that a brand should double down on advertising against, Shamny said.\n\nShamny said Limy intends to invest its new funding in its sales, marketing, and growth teams as the company expands globally. He expects the team will grow to around 120 people by the end of the year, up from about 25.\n\nCheck out the pitch deck Limy used to secure its $10 million seed investment, shared exclusively with Business Insider. Some of the slides have been omitted or redacted.\n\nShamny said AI agents will increasingly carry out tasks for consumers, such as booking flights or shopping.\n\nInstead, brands need to think about optimizing their web presence for AI agents.\n\nThe slide depicts someone asking ChatGPT for ideas for a housewarming gift for a friend, a hotel in Las Vegas, and a playlist for a party.\n\nAI agents are evaluating, choosing, and acting on behalf of humans, Limy says.\n\nLimy offers a way for brands to see how AI engines crawl, fetch, and index their web pages.\n\nThe slide shows a section of Limy's user interface that tracks site visits from AI bots.\n\nLimy wants to corner the markets of attribution, analytics, agentic ads, and agentic commerce.\n\nIt then detects and analyzes AI bot visits, presenting actionable insights for brands.\n\nThe slide shows how a luggage brand could use Limy's tool to see how a particular suitcase stacks up in product rankings within LLMs.\n\nLimy says brands can use its insights to ensure they're placing ads against the best topics and prompts to drive revenue.\n\n\"Our North Star is to build the internet for agents,\" Shamny said. \"When agents are going to dominate the web, we're giving the ability for brands to be a part of the conversation.\"\n\nWhile this slide is redacted, customers listed on its website include AstraZeneca, Kia, and Samsung.",

But he also says that the public's concerns about AI aren't always \"well-targeted.\"\n\nSpecifically, he argued that data centers don't \"use that much water,\" while concerns about electricity bills are \"understandable\" but only a minor part of the conversation.\n\n\"I think in the long run, it's not about power bills, it's about enormous abundance, and whether they get their piece of the abundance,\" Amodei said in the interview.",

And officials at three of them told Business Insider that their lessons are only informed by Ukrainian experiences.\n\n\"As of today, we do not receive any particularly useful information from our allies regarding the use of drones,\" other than training on any equipment that allies provide, one said.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that said 100% of his school's teachings come from feedback or information from soldiers who are in the field.\n\nOne example he gave was in stopping enemy drones: \"All experience in striking down drones is based only on the experience of the Ukrainian Defense Forces.\"\n\nHe said there isn't time for theoretical tactics that may not work when needed most. \"We are in a situation where we need to respond quickly to new drones and the tactics of their use by the enemy,\" he said. \"Accordingly, techniques are being tested in practice, and only those techniques that really work are being retained.\"\n\nAnother drone school, Dronarium, said the school's training \"is based on existing combat experience, which changes very rapidly.\"\n\nBecause of that pace, instructors said Ukraine is often better positioned to share lessons than to receive them. \"In this sense, at the moment it is rather us who can share valuable information with them, rather than our foreign partners sharing it with us,\" Anastasia Sobova, Dronarium Academy's chief business development officer, told BI.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have been receiving Western training throughout the war, with mixed feedback. Some has been well received, while other elements have been deemed irrelevant to the kind of fighting Ukraine faces now.\n\nUkraine's troops say combat tactics can become out of date in a matter of only weeks; the drone war is no different.\n\nMatt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of DroneShield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that the speed of battlefield changes has shifted weapon development cycles from months and years to weeks.\n\nThings change so fast on the battlefield that the schools need to frequently rewrite their lessons, sometimes as fast as every other week.\n\nThese drone schools stay on top of changes by sending their instructors to the front, maintaining constant contact with program graduates and other soldiers who send updates from the battlefield, and testing new technology.\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, said that his school's graduates exchange messages with the school to share new information about what's happening on the battlefield or get advice from teachers.\n\n\"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\" The information they get from those on the front line goes into the teaching for the next groups.\n\nPervak said in his school, \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge. Some instructors occasionally visit combat units of the UAV to see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nMany Western militaries, including the US, acknowledge they are behind on drone warfare and that their tactics need updating. It is an area where Ukraine is helping partner nations that have assisted it in its defense.\n\nWestern and NATO militaries are closely watching the war, concerned that Russia could threaten Europe and that drones would play a major role in any wider conflict. That worry has intensified efforts to learn from Ukraine's experience, particularly in drone operations and counter-drone tactics. The Ukrainians are attempting to meet that demand for expertise.\n\nUkraine agreed to help Poland with drone warfare training and has helped train Norway's drone operators.\n\nUkrainian military specialists traveled to Denmark to participate in counter-drone exercises. Copenhagen said in April it intended to send unarmed soldiers to Ukraine for drone warfare training, though it is unclear if that has taken place.\n\nThe UK says Ukraine has influenced its drone doctrine as well. Britain leads an international effort to train Ukrainian troops, known as Operation Interflex, and those Ukrainian soldiers often arrive with more real-world drone experience than their trainers.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards, told Business Insider that one surprise from the training was \"how much we would learn.\" His unit now trains in drone warfare and 3D printing drone parts based on Ukrainian lessons.\n\nPervak described sharing expertise as a way to repay allies for their support. \"Not forgetting the fact that we are truly grateful for the remarkable support from our allies, it is time now to share our latest battlefield experience.\"\n\nDrones might not dominate a NATO war against Russia to the same extent they do in Ukraine — in part because Western militaries possess capabilities Ukraine lacks — but they are no longer viewed as a niche tool. Ukraine's experience has led to a realization that this tech may very well be the future of warfare.",

    "title": "Amazon slashes 16,000 roles in latest phase of a broader reset",
    "description": "Amazon announces another mass layoff as CEO Andy Jassy takes aim at bureaucracy and seeks a cultural reset.",
    "fullText": "Amazon said it is eliminating around 16,000 corporate roles globally, marking its second round of mass job cuts since October, when it shed 14,000 roles.\n\nThe latest layoffs were announced on Wednesday by Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, who described the move as part of broader efforts to cut back on bureaucracy inside the company.\n\n\"As I shared in October, we've been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy,\" wrote Galetti in a memo that was shared on Amazon's blog. \"While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now.\"\n\nGaletti added that Amazon would offer \"most\" US-based employees 90 days to search for a new role internally. Those who are unable to find a role or choose not to will be given support, including severance pay and health insurance benefits, she added.\n\nThe cuts underscore Amazon's push to operate more efficiently as it reshapes the organization amid rapid advances in AI. While the company initially linked the October layoffs to AI-driven changes, CEO Andy Jassy later said those reductions were more about cultural fit than cost savings or automation.\n\nOn Tuesday, some Amazon employees received a calendar invitation regarding job cuts that had apparently been sent early.\n\nEarlier this week, Amazon also announced it would shutter its Amazon Go and Fresh stores, citing its failure to create a \"truly distinctive customer experience with the right economic model.\"\n\nAmazon employs more than 1.5 million people globally, though its corporate workforce represents a relatively small share of that total, at roughly 350,000 employees.\n\nIn recent years, Amazon has trimmed management layers, tightened spending, overhauled performance systems, and ordered most corporate employees to return to the office five days a week.\n\nGaletti acknowledged the numerous cuts in the memo, but didn't rule out further changes ahead. \"Some of you might ask if this is the beginning of a new rhythm — where we announce broad reductions every few months,\" she wrote.\n\n\"That's not our plan. But just as we always have, every team will continue to evaluate the ownership, speed, and capacity to invent for customers, and make adjustments as appropriate.\"\n\nThat cultural reset accelerated after the pandemic, when Amazon's explosive growth slowed. The company moved to rein in costs by shutting down unprofitable initiatives and shrinking what executives described as a bloated workforce. Last year, Jassy said efficiency gains from AI would eventually reduce Amazon's head count.\n\nAmazon's moves mirror a broader trend across Big Tech, where companies have cut thousands of jobs while ramping up AI investment.\n\nMicrosoft said last year it would eliminate about 15,000 positions, with CEO Satya Nadella telling employees the company needed to stay focused on its AI transformation. Meta has also made AI-driven cuts, telling employees in its risk organization last year that their roles were being replaced by automation.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "It's no secret that expensive gyms and fitness classes are filled with people who work in high-paying industries like finance and tech.\n\nBut why? Does that sauna really warrant paying an extra few hundred bucks a month in membership fees?\n\nAccording to Wall Streeters we spoke with, membership at places like Equinox or Life Time isn't about the amenities per se. Instead, members are buying two intangible benefits: the chance at networking and social status.\n\nWhile networking at the gym might sound hellish to some, it's not necessarily like you'd imagine it. Gyms will actually set up designated networking events for members, said Laz Rabanales, who works at Okada & Company, a commercial real-estate firm.\n\n\"I have a friend that works at Chelsea Piers [Fitness], and he was telling me that they throw events like ice cream social hour,\" he said.\n\nGoing hand in hand with networking is status. By paying high monthly fees, it's shorthand for other members that you're of high corporate and social status.\n\n\"I feel you can kind of signal to other people that you're paying a lot for a gym membership — so you have a good job and that kind of thing,\" said Nyla Legemah, a customer success manager for benchmarks and indices at London Stock Exchange Group in New York. \"It's like assumed you made it to the club.\"\n\nBut the expensive gym trend also simply reflects societal changes — young people increasingly care about their health and longevity, and are willing to prioritize it.\n\n\"I think that the status element of going to a nice gym is a factor for some people but it is also a generational shift that focuses on health and wellness instead of buying items,\" said Alexander Wah, the founder and chief investment officer at Prince Capital.\n\nCassie Henry, a trader at Gresham Investment Management, a hedge fund, said that workout classes have sometimes taken the place of client happy hours.\n\n\"Banks will take us out, do a workout class instead of getting a drink,\" Henry said. \"It's a good value if someone pays $50 for your pilates class.\"\n\nCaring about being fit in and of itself can also be an outward manifestation of status in the finance world, Rabanales said.\n\n\"You always want to look good because you always want to impress your clients in this industry,\" he said. \"The minute you walk into a room, they'll judge you.\"",

    "description": "Org charts reveal a company's power structure. A copy of Starbucks' chart shows who's helping CEO Brian Niccol drive the chain's turnaround.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks' comeback is taking shape — and a leaked internal organizational chart shows exactly who CEO Brian Niccol is relying on to build on the momentum.\n\nThe chart from early January, obtained by Business Insider, lays out the people who report directly to the CEO, including several longtime Niccol allies from Chipotle and Taco Bell, as the coffee giant's \"Back to Starbucks\" turnaround gains traction and its stock starts to rebound.\n\nSince Business Insider viewed the chart, the company has made some leadership changes. Most notably, Anand Varadarajan started as chief technology officer on January 19, reporting to Niccol. Business Insider was unable to determine how often the org chart is updated.\n\nRepresentatives for Starbucks declined to comment for this story.\n\nTake a look at Niccol's direct reports and their responsibilities, according to the internal org chart:\n\nAs of mid-January, the org chart showed that Niccol's direct reports included his executive assistant and eight current executives who are helping him reverse the coffee chain's slumping sales and usher in a new era of streamlined customer service and coffeehouse redesigns.\n\nThe org chart also included former chief legal officer Brad Lerman among Niccol's direct reports. He left the role in November and remained as an advisor for a period to support the transition, according to a securities filing.\n\nIncluding those listed above, Niccol has hired at least half a dozen executives who worked with him on his prior turnaround campaign at Chipotle — and his stint as Taco Bell's chief executive before that. Most of those hires joined Starbucks at the vice president role or higher since Niccol took the helm in late 2024, Business Insider reported in September.\n\nLieberman became Starbucks' chief brand officer after holding senior marketing roles under Niccol at both Taco Bell and Chipotle. Grams, the former Taco Bell operating chief, came out of retirement to take the same role at Starbucks, and Meredith Sandland, Taco Bell's onetime chief development officer during Niccol's tenure, also joined as EVP of coffeehouse design and development under Grams — driving a key piece of Niccol's turnaround plan.\n\nThe chart reveals another one of Niccol's Chipotle-era executives has joined the coffee giant: Ryan Guthrie, the coffee brand's VP of government affairs, who led the same department while Niccol was CEO of Chipotle, joined Starbucks in September 2025.\n\nThe executive leadership team is in charge of steering Starbucks' turnaround effort, which has recently begun to accelerate. Starbucks' stock is up more than 13% so far this year, and the company has stabilized since Niccol took over, breaking a six-quarter comparable sales slump as of October.\n\nA report from the location intelligence and foot traffic data software firm Placer.ai found that the week of November 10, which includes Red Cup Day — one of the chain's busiest sales days of the year — saw visits spike by 5.8% year over year. The prior week, when the collectible Bearista cup launched, visits were up 11.6% year over year.\n\nPlacer.ai also found that Starbucks' growth in visits during the second half of 2025 outperformed the wider coffee category during the final stretch of the year.\n\nMore than just a corporate diagram, the chart underscores a familiar playbook for Niccol: surround himself with trusted lieutenants from past turnarounds as he engineers Starbucks' revitalization.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Lights out and away we go… on your next job application.\n\nBut for this one, put aside your CV and interview-question AI bot. To secure the job, just place first in a global autonomous drone racing competition.\n\nThat's how defense industry disruptor Anduril is recruiting for an engineering role.\n\nThe defense tech startup has launched an \"AI Grand Prix\" to find \"the boldest engineers from around the globe.\"\n\nAnduril's competition calls teams and individuals from around the globe to develop AI systems capable of piloting high-speed racing drones through professional-grade race courses with zero human control. The fastest drone to fly autonomously through a course wins.\n\n\"The competitive edge is gained entirely by optimizing the best code for the race,\" Anduril said on its website.\n\nThe \"AI Grand Prix\" kicks off in April with two virtual rounds, followed by a two-week training and physical qualifier in California in September.\n\nThe big race day will be held in November in Ohio, where Anduril is building a 5 million-square-foot factory. Arsenal-1, as the factory is known, is just outside Columbus.\n\nParticipants can compete individually or in teams of up to eight. All ages are allowed to participate, but under-17s require parental consent and won't be eligible for the job at Anduril following the competition.\n\nIf the event is won by a team, the $500,000 prize money will be split between its members, Anduril said.\n\nThe idea came from Palmer Luckey, Anduril's founder, according to the AI Grand Prix website.\n\nLuckey has long favored unconventional paths. He began taking college courses at 14 and was 19 when he dropped out of California State University to launch the virtual reality company Oculus VR in 2012.\n\nHe worked at Facebook (now Meta) before launching Anduril in 2017, alongside four co-founders, with the mission of modernizing the US military and developing autonomous weapons that \"will save Western civilization.\"\n\nLuckey's penchant for fun and games aside, unusual job campaigns are becoming a hallmark of Anduril's recruitment strategy.\n\nIn 2025, the defense tech startup ran a reverse psychology hiring campaign with the slogan \"Don't work at Anduril,\" which included a video ad that mocked nap pods, distant leadership, and the supposed lack of mission synonymous with modern tech jobs.\n\nLuckey has previously said that over-reliance on Silicon Valley types can be a trap for businesses. Talent in the Bay Area is often \"very mercenary-minded\" and more interested in résumé building than mission, he told Lulu Cheng Meservey in an interview in September 2025.\n\nAnduril deliberately recruits nationwide and makes a point of hiring armed forces veterans, Luckey said.\n\nAnduril's recruitment drive is likely to pick up. The startup is valued at $30.5 billion as of June 2025, and is considering an IPO in 2026.\n\nAs the United States races to modernize warfare, Luckey's company has emerged as the face of the defense tech boom and proved it can compete for contracts with legacy defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.\n\nAnduril did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.",

    "description": "Ilma Lopez, a Portland, Maine, restaurant owner, decided to put up a \"No ICE\" poster and was surprised by some of the phone calls and online reviews.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ilma Lopez, 44, co-owner of the Ugly Duckling luncheonette and two other food businesses in Portland, Maine. She recently put up a \"No ICE\" sign after immigration agents began stepped-up enforcement efforts in the city. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nWhen I found out ICE was going to be here, I got super worried. We have immigrants working with us, like every other business in town.\n\nAs a business owner, when you cross those doors being a guest or a team member, I'm responsible for you. I cannot put anyone at risk. We're responsible for making sure you have a great service, great food, and for your well-being in this establishment.\n\nThat's why we put the \"No ICE\" sign. I want people to be able to walk in here without being worried about what's going to happen to them.\n\nLawyers are telling us, \"Just be careful.\" I've been a citizen for 10 years. This is the first time I've had to carry a copy of my passport.\n\nThis will impact all of us collectively. Business-wise, if you take all the immigrants away, who is going to clean your house? Who are the ones who will do your nails? Nannies? Who is going to pick crops on the farms? Who's going to do construction? Immigrants do that and so much more.\n\nWhen we put up a social post about our \"No ICE\" poster, it's because putting up the sign was the right thing to do — for a lot of reasons. After I posted, we started getting emails and bad online reviews. We were laughing because we just got one review that said our tacos were awful. We don't even sell tacos.\n\nThey're getting personal. We're getting emails along the lines of, \"We can't wait until ICE gets you out of here,\" and \"Nobody speaks English there.\" You're like, \"Where do you draw the line?\" I get that we don't have the same beliefs, but you're messing with employees' well-being.\n\nWe've had phone calls. It was all different area codes and some from Maine. The nicest thing that someone said was that I was an ugly liberal.\n\nThey also said things like, \"You don't support ICE; you're not a Mainer. You don't belong here.\"\n\nWhen I decided to put up the social post, I thought, \"Some people are not going to be happy about it.\" I'm not trying to make my food political, because it's not. It's food. I never thought people were going to be so hateful.\n\nI went through this roller coaster of feelings. A group of people were saying that they were going to boycott the restaurant, and they can't wait until we close. So, of course, I got worried when we were slow. Then people started showing up, so it balances it out.\n\nOur team is phenomenal. We've gotten great support from our community. What keeps me going is that I know we can do this. I know it's going to be hard and not ideal for a while.\n\nThe other thing that keeps me going is that I have two kids. I need to show them that you can have your beliefs — you can have your core values — and that those are valid.\n\nI'm hoping my kids have more protection because they were born here. I don't know, but I'm hoping, as a mom.\n\nI had to follow a legal process to become a citizen. I've been in this country for 22 years. I became a citizen 10 years ago. For 12 years, I was following every single step. It's expensive; it's time-consuming. You do it because it's the right thing to do.\n\nOur teams have done the same thing. They have green cards and work permits. They're not citizens — yet. That's one of the reasons that we're worried because they're not as protected as a citizen.\n\nWhat I'm asking ICE is, do the same thing. Follow the law. If you want to check something, bring me a warrant. Don't be rude when you take people. They're scared. Everyone's scared.\n\nMy 12-year-old is like, \"What's going on?\" As a parent, you don't want that for your kids. I got home late one day because I was working. She was up, and I was like, \"How are you feeling?\" She said, \"I'm a little concerned.\" I was like, \"It's OK, you're American.\" She was like, \"But you're not.\"\n\nWhat am I going to say? I said, \"We're going to be fine. I have my paperwork. We have nothing to worry about.\" It's concerning because it's her community. It's her friends from school. Everyone knows an immigrant.\n\nI'm an American, but this feels different. I felt that it doesn't matter how hard I work — I will never be 100% accepted. I know that not everybody thinks like that, but that's how I felt.\n\nI don't regret the decision to move here. I would do it all over again. This is not the America I moved to. I know this doesn't represent all of us.\n\nEditor's note: Business Insider reached out to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Customs and Border Protection for comment about their interactions with small businesses in Maine.",

    "description": "Mallerie Shirley and her husband were found to be neglectful of their 6-year-old  after letting him scooter to a park alone.",
    "fullText": "Mallerie Shirley and her husband, Christopher Pleasants, were pleased when their 6-year-old son asked if he could go to a nearby park on his electric scooter, as he'd done before.\n\nIt was November 4, 2025, and he was off from school for Election Day. The parents, who live in Atlanta, thought it was great that he was getting some air and meeting friends at a fundraiser benefiting animals in the playground.\n\nThey were both busy working at home; the boy was a confident child, the weather was good, and it was a safe neighborhood.\n\nHe spent just under an hour at the playground, then, wearing a helmet, made the about 4-minute journey back home on the path — part of a 22-mile urban pedestrian, cycling, and e-scooter trail called the Atlanta Beltline.\n\nThen, he was stopped by a stranger in a car.\n\nThe first grader later told his parents that the person in the car asked where they were, his name, his age, and whether he lived nearby. He didn't tell her and sped home.\n\nShirley, a software engineering manager, said he seemed shaken when he arrived.\n\n\"He was very upset because he's used to being independent,\" she told Business Insider. \"We've always encouraged him to be self-sufficient.\"\n\nThe 39-year-old said his level of freedom aligned with his advanced maturity she'd witnessed for a child his age. She trusted him to ride about 0.3 miles on the Beltline, which they could see from their house.\n\n\"We know our son better than anyone and were OK with him going such a short distance on a path full of people walking and cycling,\" Shirley, first interviewed by the media outlet Reason, said.\n\nShe said he had made the journey at least twice since September, when they first allowed him to do so.\n\nThe family put the incident with the stranger behind them. Two days later, while Shirley was out, Pleasants, 38, answered the door to a child welfare worker.\n\nThe Division of Family and Children's Services (DFCS) had received a report that his son was seen on his scooter unsupervised, and it was a regular occurrence.\n\nA spokesperson for the DFCS in Georgia told Business Insider the agency was \"bound by both state and federal law to protect the privacy of the people we serve. As such, we are unable to comment on the specifics of any reported abuse or neglect cases.\"\n\nThey added, \"We take seriously every report that might be made to the agency and work with law enforcement when appropriate to ensure the safety of Georgia's children.\"\n\nPleasants, an AI research manager, said that the investigator who visited the house said the authorities would consider the boy too young to go to the park alone and would classify the situation as \"inadequate supervision\" because \"anything could happen.\"\n\nThe shocked father said he responded that his son was independent and mature enough to make the journey.\n\nPleasants let the case worker into their home, where she took photographs, including the contents of the refrigerator and the bedrooms of their son and 3-year-old daughter.\n\nThe parents later heard from teachers that a caseworker had interviewed the boy at his school and had also dropped in on his sister at day care that same day.\n\nThere was a sequence of frantic phone calls between Pleasants, Shirley, and the worker that afternoon. It ended with the parents — reluctantly, they say — signing a \"safety plan,\" which said that the children would be supervised at all times.\n\n\"We thought things would be even worse if we didn't comply,\" Shirley said. They were told that the investigation into their case was ongoing and that there was no prospective date for lifting the safety plan.\n\nThe couple immediately prohibited their son from playing outside their home or cycling to his friends' houses. They were terrified that someone else would file a report against them if they did. \"He got stir-crazy, but we didn't tell him what was going on in case it worried him,\" Shirley said.\n\nShe said she and her husband are \"data-driven people\" who established that child kidnapping by strangers was extremely rare, compared to abductions by people whom a child knows.\n\nThey researched their parental rights. They knew about a bill passed in Georgia in May 2025 that protected parents' rights to give their children independence, and they examined the legislation more closely.\n\nThe Reasonable Childhood Independence Law revised the definition of neglect to put a child in \"real, significant, and imminent risk of harm that would be so obvious…that a legal custodian acting reasonably would not have exposed the child to the risk of imminent harm.\"\n\nIt also ruled that \"independent activity…shall include, but shall not be limited to, playing indoors or outdoors alone, or with other children, walking to school, running errands, or traveling to local commercial or recreational facilities.\"\n\nThe law — which does not specify the age a child has to have reached — led the couple to believe that DFCS would have no grounds to find them responsible for neglect.\n\nThey opened a letter from the agency on December 30, 2025, almost two months after the incident. It said the authorities had substantiated the finding of neglect \"based on the preponderance of evidence.\"\n\n\"My heart pounding and sinking doesn't even describe it,\" Shirley, who petitioned for an urgent administrative review of the negligence ruling, said. \"It was like dropping a bowling ball down an empty well. I experienced true anxiety for the first time in my life and haven't been able to sleep.\"\n\nAs the case continued into January, the couple contacted attorney David Delugas, founder and executive director of the nonprofit ParentsUSA, which helps families in similar circumstances.\n\nHe backed Shirley and Pleasants's request for the DFCS to expedite the review. He also lodged a complaint with the Office of Child Advocacy.\n\n\"Mallerie and Christopher's children are their children to raise,\" the lawyer told Business Insider. \"The DFCS used their son's age alone as though all children in all places in Georgia are similar at that age.\"\n\n\"Despite the absence of harm, danger, or neglect, the DFCS determined negligence, using up valuable resources intended for those children who are really at risk,\" Delugas told Business Insider.\n\nOn January 23, Shirley received an unexpected phone call from a case manager who said the initial finding of negligence was unsubstantiated. It was unclear whether the safety plan had been lifted as a result, but the family wants to know when they will receive an official letter, which the case manager said DFCS would send out.\n\nDelugas said that, whatever the letter says, the report on Shirley and Pleasants' case would not be expunged.\n\n\"The accusation of neglect and the investigation, and the pictures taken of their home and the interviews of their children, will not be eliminated from the DSCS system,\" DeLugas said. \"If there's a second report of alleged neglect or lack of supervision, the case managers will still consider the family's record.\"\n\n\"It's an ongoing concern that is stopping us from raising our children the way we intended, in giving them freedom and self-reliance,\" Shirley said.",

    "description": "General Motors generated $2 billion in software and subscription sales in the past three quarters — and expects billions more this year.",
    "fullText": "General Motors has been pulling a Tim Cook and boosting its software and subscription business.\n\nDuring the automaker's Tuesday earnings call, CEO Mary Barra highlighted the rapid growth of GM's in-vehicle software and subscription business.\n\nIn the past nine months, GM's software generated $2 billion, and customers have already signed up for about $5 billion in future subscriptions.\n\nThe company said it now has 11 million subscribers for its OnStar safety system, up 34% from a year earlier. Another half a million customers are also paying for Super Cruise, its hands-free driver-assistance system.\n\nNow, that's still just a fraction of its total revenue, which was $45.29 billion in the last quarter alone. But the margins on those services are also higher than on cars sales.\n\nGM says its software business keeps roughly 70 cents of every dollar it brings in. That's a rare level of profitability in the auto industry, as many car sales generate just four to 10 cents per sales dollar.\n\n\"We are also executing plans to grow software and services like OnStar and Super Cruise to generate even greater revenue during and after each vehicle sale,\" Barra said on the call. \"We think there's a growth opportunity there with very attractive margins.\"\n\n\"Software and services are becoming increasingly important to how customers experience GM vehicles and how we deliver value beyond the initial purchase,\" a spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\nThe company also said it will keep adding features and services to vehicles over time, rather than relying on hardware upgrades.\n\n\"As vehicles become more software-defined, we can introduce new digital experiences through updates and optional services rather than hardware changes,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nThe subscriptions push comes as automakers look for new ways to make money after cars leave the dealership lot — especially as Detroit automakers roll out new electric vehicles.\n\nEVs typically need less maintenance than gas-powered cars, cutting into the repair and service work that has long been a reliable profit engine for dealerships and manufacturers alike.\n\nGM has structured its subscriptions to ease customers in. OnStar Basics is included with 2025 and newer GM vehicles at no extra cost, bundling safety features, navigation, and audio apps for up to eight years.\n\nPaid subscriptions come later. GM charges $19.99 a month for Connect Plus, which provides in-car internet access, and $39.99 a month for Super Cruise, its hands-free, eyes-on system. Driver assistance is free for the first three years.\n\nGM isn't the only automaker leaning into its subscriptions business.\n\nThis month, Tesla said it would discontinue the $8,000 option to buy its self-driving software, called Full Self-Driving (Supervised), outright. After February 14, owners must pay $99 a month for the service — a price point Elon Musk said will increase as the technology gets better.\n\nFord's highway-assist feature — called BlueCruise — costs $49.99 a month, $495 for a year, or $2,495 for the car's lifetime.\n\nMercedes-Benz and BMW also offer self-driving upgrades on some of their new vehicles.\n\nBut for GM, America's best-selling car company, profits from the new subscriptions could be a boon. Wall Street was pleased with the automaker's earnings report, sending the company's stock up 8.8% in the hours after the earnings call.\n\n\"This is playing out as a software story GM first told us about in 2021,\" David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, told Business Insider. \"If they can do other software as a fee, plus data to local governments on traffic and accident risk, there's real potential for revenue streams at margins impossible to reach via just selling a car.\"",

    "fullText": "\"I have a lot, a lot of incredible, good opinions about him,\" said Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola when asked about Oscar Bobb in November.\n\n\"His intuition is extraordinary. The moment he frees his mind he can do it.\"\n\nTwo months on and Bobb is close to leaving for Fulham for a reported fee of around £30m - the 22-year-old Norway winger the latest City youth graduate to depart after breaking into the first team.\n\nSince Guardiola took charge in 2016 and transformed City into an all-conquering team, Cole Palmer, Liam Delap, Brahim Diaz and Tosin Adarabioyo have also come through the ranks to play for the senior side before departing.\n\nIt is a ploy that has served City well.\n\nAccording to Paul MacDonald from FootballTransfers.com, City have made more than £250m selling young players from their talent factory over the past five years alone.\n\nIncluding sell-on fees, that figure is closer to £270m, he says.\n\nBrazilian midfielder Douglas Luiz did not make a competitive appearance for the club before the then 21-year-old was sold to Aston Villa for £15m in 2019.\n\nJadon Sancho was sold to Borussia Dortmund for a reported £8m in 2017 before joining Manchester United £73m just four years later, while Jeremie Frimpong was signed by Liverpool for £29.5m from Bayer Leverkusen last summer. They have both gone on to make names for themselves after leaving City without making a first-team appearance.\n\nMorgan Rogers, who joined City from West Brom at the age of 17 on a professional contract, was sold to Middlesbrough in 2023 and is now thriving for Aston Villa and England.\n\nCity spent a British record £100m on Jack Grealish in 2021, while they invested £77m on Croatia centre-back Josko Gvardiol two years later - and this January spent £65m on Antoine Semenyo and £20m on Marc Guehi.\n\nYet it is their ability to sell young talent that has helped bring in funds for big-money deals.\n\nWhere are they now & what's their market value?, external",

    "fullText": "Luis Enrique rarely lets slip any admission of his team's weaknesses.\n\nThe Spaniard described Paris St-Germain's defeat at Sporting in the Champions League last week as their best away performance since he took over as manager in 2023.\n\nThat is a bold claim, given the European champions have won in Barcelona and scored seven in Leverkusen this season alone.\n\nBut the statistics do not necessarily contradict his assessment, even if the PSG boss may have been looking to shield his players from increased criticism.\n\nPSG appeared to have a firm grip on the match, with three-quarters of the possession, 28 shots, and three disallowed goals, but were undone by a late double from Sporting's Colombia striker Luis Suarez.\n\n\"We deserved to win, but that's how it is in football,\" said Luis Enrique.\n\nDespite controlling the game, issues which plagued the start of the Parisians' Champions League campaign last season - as they went winless in four fixtures - seem to have resurfaced.\n\nJust like in the autumn of 2024, their otherwise authoritative displays have been undermined by defensive mistakes and poor finishing.\n\nLast year, the spectacular turnaround in form which culminated in a treble was helped by some clinical finishing, especially in away matches where chances were few and far between.\n\nAt the same time, low blocks were taken apart by a fluid front three led by Ousmane Dembele in an all-action false-nine role.\n\nHowever, the free-flowing attacks from last season have been replaced by long passages of stale possession this term - as the league defeats by Marseille and Monaco illustrated.\n\nThose results could be explained by the injury crisis which meant Dembele, Desire Doue, Nuno Mendes and Achraf Hakimi were all sidelined in the autumn.\n\nThe Coupe de France loss to Paris FC earlier this month, though, seemed to confirm something is not clicking for PSG.\n\nA convincing win over Lille a few days later, in which Dembele scored an improbable lob from the edge of the box, only briefly hinted at a return to their best.\n\nPSG were then wasteful in defeat in Portugal and again in the 1-0 win at Auxerre last Friday.\n\n\"We created a lot of chances, but we're lacking a bit of confidence and accuracy to finish them,\" Luis Enrique said after the latter victory which meant his side moved above Lens to the top of Ligue 1.\n\nPSG are also currently in the top eight of the Champions League's league phase, but have so far not matched the impressive standards set last season.",

    "description": "Comment: UFC 325 is headlined by a rematch that few are craving, with the UFC overlooking fresh challengers to featherweight king Volkanovski",
    "fullText": "When in a bind, sanction a rematch. It’s an easy solution for bookers, leaning back into a pre-made rivalry and billing it as its second coming. There’s a score to be settled, et cetera.\n\nBut not every feud needs to be run back. Such is the case with UFC 325’s main event on Saturday 31 January, which pits two-time featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski against Diego Lopes, nine months on from their first bout. Back then, there was a lot to be excited about.\n\nVolkanovski was returning to the cage for the first time since being flatlined by Ilia Topuria, who brutally ended the Aussie’s legendary reign at 145lb. The gold had since been left vacant by “El Matador”, who’d jumped up to pursue (and swiftly achieve) similar glory at lightweight, giving Volkanovski a chance to reclaim his crown. But at 36, that redemption story was hardly a foregone conclusion. Back-to-back knockout losses, one to Topuria and the other to pound-for-pound king Islam Makhachev up a weight class, sparked fears that “Alexander The Great” was over the hill.\n\nRetirement was now a not-so-distant possibility for Volkanovski and as he squared off against Lopes, a 30-year-old jiu-jitsu specialist who had stormed through the division to earn a title shot, it felt like a gut-wrenching passing of the torch could be upon us.\n\nInstead, facing a boom-or-bust scenario, Volkanovski proved he still had it in abundance. Barring a flash knockdown in the second round, the former – and now reigning – champion outfought the Mexican-Brazilian for a convincing decision win, with prevailing opinion dictating that Volkanovski ended the fight with four rounds to Lopes’s one. “Adversity is a privilege,” he declared.\n\nAfter a fun fight and feel-good win for a fan favourite, this chapter looked ready to be closed. Yet here we are, staring down the barrel of a rematch not many – other than Lopes and his camp – particularly craved.\n\n“If you don’t like it, then don’t watch it,” said UFC president Dana White, responding to backlash over his booking of the featherweight title. A typically barbed response from White, his dismissal of wider fan sentiment – the litmus test of whether his product is living up to expectations – is the root of the company’s matchmaking problem.\n\nThe illusion that the UFC is a meritocracy may be long shattered but not only were there more interesting fights to make than Volkanovski vs Lopes 2, there were arguably more deserving challengers.\n\nStaving off British bias, Manchester’s own Lerone Murphy had a very valid case to be fighting for the belt next. Undefeated at 17-0-1, “The Miracle” is coming off his knockout-of-the-year win over hot property Aaron Pico at UFC 319, which saw him sleep the debutant with a stunning spinning back elbow on late notice. With wins over Josh Emmett, Dan Ige and Edson Barboza already under his belt, this performance acted as a title statement – something recognised by champion Volkanovski, who said it was a “no-brainer” to give Murphy a shot at the gold.\n\nYet he was overlooked, so we go to another contender. In fact, we go to the No 1 contender. Movsar Evloev, similarly undefeated at 19-0, has climbed the ladder from gatekeeper to former champion and beaten everyone on the way up. A relentless wrestler, his resume includes the scalps of Ige, Arnold Allen and Saturday’s challenger-in-question Lopes, with his most-recent win coming against ex-bantamweight king Aljamain Sterling.\n\nHowever, that fight was in December 2024. The Russian did not compete in 2025, with a slated bout against Pico for July falling through due to an injury. His inactivity would act as reasoning why White turned focus away from his top featherweight contender, though time out of the cage has not stopped fighters from being thrown immediately into the title picture. Ask Jon Jones, Colby Covington, Tyron Woodley, the list goes on.\n\nSterling was also an option, offering that champion-versus-champion angle, but Murphy and Evloev would have each felt they should have been the fresh challenge for Volkanovski that fans are desiring. By snubbing them both, a natural match-up looks set to be made: Murphy vs Evloev, probably at UFC London. It’s a great fight, but one that creates another headache for the UFC.\n\nWhen one gets their arm raised, the other’s title credibility will diminish. This is not what’s needed for a featherweight division growing lighter after the departures of Ilia Topuria and Max Holloway. Volkanovski might be next, and soon. Stars must be built at 145lb rather than snuffed out.\n\nThe former may transpire at Sydney’s Qudos Bank Arena if Lopes can dethrone Volkanovski in what might be the Aussie hero’s last act in the UFC. He was handily bested nine months ago but with both men a year older, Saturday could go very differently for the challenger, who bounced back in style to finish the dangerous Jean Silva in September.\n\nBut it feels like either way, the UFC have booked themselves into a hole when they really didn’t need to. Featherweight is regularly regarded as one of the company’s strongest divisions but, as we progress into the Paramount era, there are more questions than answers over its long-term future.",

    "fullText": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Lamar Wilkerson had 19 points, Nick Dorn added 18 and Conor Enright scored five of his eight points in the final 71 seconds to help Indiana hold off No. 12 Purdue 72-67 on Tuesday night.\n\nIndiana won its second straight game and gave coach Darian DeVries the biggest win of his first season with the Hoosiers (14-7, 5-5 Big Ten). It came in his first matchup against Indiana’s biggest rival and on the same night college football’s new national champions were honored during a pregame ceremony on the same court where coach Curt Cignetti once proclaimed “Purdue sucks.”\n\nThe Hoosiers have beaten ranked Boilermakers teams in four of their last five matchups at home.\n\nTrey Kaufman-Renn led Purdue (17-4, 7-3) with 23 points and Braden Smith added 14 points, five rebounds and five assists. But it wasn’t enough for the Boilermakers to avoid extending their losing streak to a season-worst three games.\n\nAnd once again, Purdue sure didn’t look like itself. Indiana negated the Boilermakers’ perceived advantage in the post, outrebounding them 33-28 while only getting outscored 24-18 in the paint in a game that had all the elements of a rivalry.\n\nIndiana initially took control with a 21-6 spurt to close the first half, turning a 23-21 deficit into a 40-29 lead.\n\nThen the Hoosiers had to withstand a series of second-half punches from Purdue.\n\nWhen the Boilermakers closed to 47-41 on Smith’s pull-up jumper with 15:02 to go, the Hoosiers answered with a 7-2 run. When Smith’s layup made it 65-63 with 1:28 left, Enright responded with a 3-pointer. And when Kaufman-Renn’s layup cut the deficit 68-65 with 28 seconds remaining, Enright made two free throws that helped the Hoosiers close it out.\n\nPurdue visits Maryland on Sunday.\n\nIndiana begins its Los Angeles swing with a trip to UCLA on Saturday.",

    "fullText": "Notre Dame has found itself in quite a predicament after their last few games. Niele Ivey’s team has won just a solitary game against Miami while collapsing against Louisville 79-66, UConn 89-47, and Clemson 65-58, which has understandably shaken the team. Notre Dame will be on the road for their next couple of games, visiting the West Coast. Now, the Fighting Irish’s head coach has noted serious flaws within her team, and she demands some swift changes.\n\nNiele Ivey recently joined host Tony Simeone on the “Voice of the Irish” podcast to share where she feels the team has to upgrade itself.\n\n“I think rebounding is a big part of what we need to focus on. Both teams have great balance. Cal is a little bit more athletic. They have great size, so doing a great job on the boards is something that we’re going to focus on, so that’s one thing. Offensively, I always want to work on getting better, defensively being consistent, but rebounding is going to be a big part,” said Niele Ivey as she feels that’s one aspect where the team can improve.\n\nThe rebounding disparity is striking. In their last two losses, Clemson outrebounded them 40-20, and UConn won the battle on the boards 39-24. Moreover California Golden Bears are tall and physical. Sakima Walker, 6’5″, and Claudia Langarita, 6’4″, can cause problems in the paint if the team isn’t careful, and Ivey is well aware of that.\n\n“Yeah its definitely the individual mindset for sure. But like early in the season, we can do more individual things. Right now, we’re doing more 5 on 5, so scrimmaging more.”Ivey clarified that the focus is shifting from individual drills to team-based scrimmages, emphasizing the collective effort she wants to instill in her players.\n\nNotre Dame might have found itself in a black hole, but that hasn’t affected Hannah Hidalgo’s game the slightest. The Notre Dame guard has come out as the top scorer in their last five games despite her team not being able to capitalize on her hot streak. While some are blaming Ivey, Hidalgo refuses to blame her coach.\n\nIn her last game against Clemson, Hidalgo scored 30 points, nearly half the team’s total. She also had 8 steals, 6 assists, and 4 rebounds to boot, but it all went in vain. So what is going wrong and why the sudden dip in form since January? This was the same team that was holding a 10-2 record in the season, but the following month saw a completely different story.\n\nNiele Ivey’s team is 5-3 since January started, and as such, many are coming down hard on the coach. Hidalgo isn’t buying the accusations and making sure that her team takes accountability for the mistakes made.\n\n“To be clear, it’s nothing that Coach Ivey can do to bring the level of toughness to us. This is an individual thing that everybody has to bring consistently. … It’s up to us….. to bring it out of each other… You wouldn’t look at any other team, and they say, ‘We look to our coach to bring that toughness out of us.’ That’s not a thing,” Hidalgo says.\n\nIt is fairly evident that the team is very dependent on Hannah to take them through by now, and that mentality probably won’t help much when the competition gets tough. Except for Hannah, Cassandre Prosper (15.7 PPG ) and Iyana Moore (10.8 PPG) are the only ones who are hitting double figures, and that can definitely be improved because you can’t overburden anyone with extra pressure.\n\nCoach Niele Ivey has 9 more games remaining and would hope and pray that the underlying complications are fixed as soon as possible. For now, her focus is on the upcoming West Coast swing as the first step in the team’s recovery.\n\nThe post Niele Ivey Points to Lingering Notre Dame Red Flag Ahead of West Coast Swing appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "The LSU Tigers have concluded their football season and while they focus on next year's team, their now former players are focusing on the NFL draft.\n\nAfter an impressive showing in the 2026 East-West Shrine Bowl, former Tigers wideout Chris Hilton Jr. has been a late add to the 2026 Senior Bowl roster, per WAFB's Jacques Doucet.\n\nMany scouts at the Shrine Bowl praised the performance of Hilton. It's no surprise, given that this is an environment built for someone like him to excel. The defense is at a disadvantage and he has speed for days.\n\nThe Zachary product came to Baton Rouge as a highly sought-after recruit. He was the No. 58 overall player in his class, fifth-best wideout and third in Louisiana. His ceiling always felt sky high.\n\nA number of unfortunate injuries and circumstances kept Hilton from really ever getting the opportunity to perform at LSU. He finished his career with 41 catches for 780 yards and six touchdowns. He had a career average of 19 yards per reception.\n\nIf he can stay healthy, he certainly has enough to offer an NFL team for a shot. At the very least, he has the speed for it.\n\nBeing brought over from the Shrine Bowl to the Senior Bowl is a big deal. There were 106 Senior Bowl players drafted last season. That's over 41% of the draft. He will have the chance to compete in two practices before the game and the chance to meet with every single NFL team.\n\nThis would be a fantastic journey to the league if Hilton can continue to impress.",

    "description": "There is the live possibility that all six of the Premier League clubs finish inside the top eight to qualify for the Champions League last 16, with English dominance on the European stage reflective of a shift in attitudes",
    "fullText": "In the buildup to Arsenal’s trip to Inter last week, those at their London Colney training base couldn’t help notice a shift in mood. There was no tension, it was all rather relaxed. A largely second-string team then carried that onto the pitch by breezing through a 3-1 away win against last season’s finalists. Long-time club insiders couldn’t help contrasting to 20 or even 15 years ago.\n\n“No pressure going to the San Siro for a Champions League game – imagine that.”\n\nNeedless to say, it wasn’t like that for the Premier League games either side of that win. And while some of that may be distinctive to Arsenal’s first place and a complex about winning the title, it is actually a common feeling.\n\nLiverpool’s many problems have been much less pronounced in the Champions League, where they can still stamp on Real Madrid or go to a stadium as intimidating as Olympique Marseille’s Velodrome and pick off a win.\n\nManchester City may admittedly have more angst after Bodo-Glimt, but they’d probably have taken a home match against Galatasaray to secure automatic qualification before this began. Newcastle United have meanwhile been much less inconsistent, as Tottenham Hotspur have been a force. Most starkly, Burnley and West Ham United posed more difficult challenges than Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAnd this is where there has been a very definite shift.\n\nOne source relates a common view. “The Premier League is now psychologically and tactically more challenging than the Champions League.”\n\nThe European games are described as much less tense. Crisis clubs now look forward to the refresh of a Champions League week, a total inversion of 30 years ago.\n\nSuch claims will almost sound sacrilegious to anyone who grew up steeped in the competition’s mythology from that time, as this really isn’t what the Champions League is supposed to be about. It’s cast as the pinnacle of the sport.\n\nClubs that properly have qualification in the balance – like Antonio Conte’s Napoli – will obviously feel different, but that points to another major factor.\n\nOne is a long-term structural issue that these pages have discussed so much over the years. The Premier League has so much more collective wealth, as can be seen with how Marseille’s total revenue is lower than that of 14 English clubs, and close to half of Villa’s wage bill. Such forces have created a talent drain from everywhere else. Essentially, any time anyone starts to do anything good – and this is especially true as regards coaching – they are snapped up by an English club.\n\nThe only exception seems to be with the majority of truly elite stars. In what looks like a necessary counterbalance, such players – from Kylian Mbappe to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – are still attracted to the glamour of the European super clubs, who also tend to accommodate their wage structures accordingly. Some Premier League figures feel this is the one remaining area where the English competition is missing out, as if it doesn’t already have enough.\n\nIt is very much a coach’s league, though, as recent articles about the effect of pressing and set pieces on goals have illustrated. Many of the major Champions League clubs don’t have to think about this in the same way, repeatedly leading to the bizarre scenes of Arne Slot declaring his delight that European opposition don’t play in a low block.\n\nThey might have to start thinking about it if English dominance continues – but the wonder is how far that goes.\n\nAs we go into the grand television event that is the final group night – intended to make all of this worthwhile – there is the live possibility that all six of the English clubs qualify as part of the top eight. Arsenal are already all but confirmed as top.\n\nEven if all six don’t qualify, it says enough that it’s a distinctive prospect, to say nothing that six clubs from one country is already too much anyway.\n\nThere are figures at the top of Uefa who readily complain about how the “European space” was made impossible by Bosman and an economic context that ensures a concentration of wealth to an ever-narrowing area of the game, although questions could then be asked about decisions made and regulation.\n\nThis very Champions League model was partly intended to be a regulatory response to all this, but it might well have had the adverse effect.\n\nSo much of the competition feels like the stakes are so low. Even this week, Napoli vs Chelsea is one of the few matches that feels “big”, but it’s not like it’s a straight knockout: Chelsea have the safety net.\n\nIt’s another contrast with the Premier League. For all the bombast of the competition, there is constant noise and narrative around it; with these Champions League matches, many of them feel like filler with little consequence.\n\nBecause, no matter how you try to talk around it, even a Paris Saint-Germain vs Newcastle United that is about automatic qualification won’t feel the same as sudden death.\n\nTake the example of that Spurs vs Dortmund match. Would it have felt quite so forgiving for Spurs if it were a knockout? The energy would have been completely different. Dortmund themselves would surely have looked different, and perhaps prepared a more layered gameplan than something that just felt like it was for a weekly league match.\n\nAnd yet these strange stakes may also work another way.\n\nIt’s been said before, but there is a considerable irony to how the “prize” for the top eight is to avoid an extra two “punishment” fixtures, when the entire point of this expanded Champions League is that the wealthy clubs actively wanted more games. Arsenal badly needed a free midweek, so they played for it.\n\nWhat does that say about the football calendar and its effects?\n\nHence, a mere two English winners in this decade so far, despite all that wealth. Premier League teams get to the business end too exhausted, and after so much more competitive tension in their domestic league, where the European super clubs’ greater stars finally have that space to excel.\n\nLook at the fate of last year’s group winners, Liverpool. Arsenal might have to be conscious of that.\n\nPSG’s victory in the final, meanwhile, only fosters the sense that very little of this matters that much, even allowing for changes that mean knockout home games will be dictated by the table.\n\nWednesday night will, of course, still be fun. Goals will rain in. The table will constantly change, even if that works against any sense of drama, as there’s much to keep up with.\n\nThe Champions League is supposed to be about so much more than that, though. And it’s supposed to be about much more than a handful of clubs.",

    "fullText": "Coco Gauff’s emotional outburst at the AO has reignited a broader debate about player privacy. After her 1-6, 2-6 loss to Elina Svitolina in the QF, footage surfaced of the American smashing her racket in what she believed was a private backstage area. The 21-year-old later expressed disappointment over the moment being broadcast. Now, her fellow tennis star Iga Swiatek has also echoed her concerns, questioning the lack of privacy for players behind the scenes.\n\nSwiatek also made her way out of the competition with a 5-7, 1-6 loss to Elena Rybakina. But during her post-match press conference, she was asked to reflect a bit on the cameras backstage at the tournament. Replying to that, the Pole said, “The question is, are we tennis players? Or are we animals in the zoo? Where they are observed even when they’re pooping. Ok, that was exaggerating obviously, but it would be nice to have some privacy. It would be nice also to have your own process and not always be observed.”\n\nShe stressed the importance of having some space where the players can do private things without the whole world watching. Iga Swiatek gave a few examples of courts and highlighted how, at some tournaments, it’s impossible to avoid people constantly observing them. “I don’t think it should be like that because we are tennis players. We’re meant to be watched on court and in the press. That’s our job. It’s not our job to be a meme when you forget your accreditation. It’s funny for sure. People have something to talk about. For us, I don’t think it’s necessary.”\n\nWhen Swiatek was asked if she had talked to the tournament about it here, she replied, “What’s the point?”\n\nThe post Iga Swiatek Speaks Out on Players’ Privacy After Coco Gauff’s Infamous Racket Break Incident: “Are We Animals” appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "The United Center in Chicago will become the first major U.S. sports venue to offer THC-infused drinks during events, reflecting a growing demand for non-alcoholic alternatives.\n\nThe arena — home to the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks — announced the move on Tuesday in a joint statement with RYTHM, a local beverage company.\n\nThe company inked a multi-year deal with the stadium to sell its drink, called Señorita, which contains hemp-derived THC, to guests 21 and older at live events, including concerts. The beverages, however, will not be available at sporting events due to league regulations.\n\n\"We are excited to introduce Señorita and RYTHM to the live entertainment space,” Joe Myhra, the chief operating officer at United Center, said in the release. “As we continue to evolve offerings for our guests, RYTHM’s Chicago roots made its beverage line a natural fit for the United Center experience.”\n\nSeñorita, which includes five milligrams of THC per drink, will become available for purchase at the stadium beginning in February.\n\n“Bringing Señorita and RYTHM to the United Center reflects a simple truth: consumers want non-alcoholic options, and leading venues are responding,” Ben Kovler, the CEO of RYTHM, said in the release.\n\n“The United Center is one of the world’s premier venues and continues to set the standard for live entertainment with the introduction of these modern, responsible options,” he added.\n\nThe announcement comes as demand for alcoholic beverages has fallen to a record low in the U.S., according to an August Gallup poll. In the survey, 54 percent of Americans reported consuming alcohol, marking the lowest share since 1939. The trend is largely driven by younger adults.\n\nAt the same time, young Americans are increasingly unwinding with weed drinks.\n\nIn an August poll by Drug Rehab USA, 66 percent of Gen Z and Millennial respondents said they had tried alternatives to alcohol in the past six months, with 24 percent saying they had “at least partially” substituted alcohol with non-alcoholic or cannabis-infused drinks.",

    "fullText": "Early on in the 25/26 season, when the Los Angeles Lakers were flying high, Austin Reaves was one of their best players. Of course, he was playing a supporting role to Luka Doncic, but it was key, and something they’re missing in their current rollercoaster stretch.\n\nFor now, Reaves remains out with the calf strain he sustained in December and will miss the Lakers’ next game against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Wednesday, at the very least. However, he is not too far from returning, and could very well arrive in time for the most crucial part of the season.\n\nDanny Green, for one, feels that Reaves’ performances in the postseason will actually determine how far the Lakers can go. One thing is for certain, though. Reaves has to do much better than he did in previous seasons.\n\nOn ESPN, the topic of discussion was: which player is most important to the Lakers this season, and Green’s answer was Reaves and how he performs in the playoffs. “Of course, in the playoffs, we’ve seen his numbers have taken a dip,” he began.\n\nLast season, Reaves averaged 21 points per game in the regular season, but his numbers dipped to 16 in the playoffs. This season, his regular-season scoring has jumped to 26 points per game so far. It is a significant leap, and one that will need to carry over into the playoffs as well.\n\nGreen feels that not much will change on the defensive front for the Lakers, even if they sign a 3 and D-wing. So, their best chance to beat teams is to outscore them.\n\n“They’re gonna need these guys to score a bunch, obviously. Luke is proven, Bron is proven in the playoffs, Austin Reaves is the guy they’re kind of seeing if he’s gonna grow and take that next step to being that third scorer consistently, night in and night out,” Green added. “So, they’re gonna need him.”\n\nThe Lakers looked genuinely comfortable with Reaves and Doncic running the offense, but they slipped into a slump once Reaves was injured and LeBron was forced into a secondary scoring role. That is something that has to change in the coming weeks, even if it means James taking a step back to allow Reaves to thrive.\n\nCurrently, the Lakers are 28-17 and fifth in the Western Conference.\n\nThe post “They’re Gonna Need Him”: Austin Reaves’ Playoff Leap Will Determine Lakers’ Ceiling, Says Danny Green appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "title": "Why the Champions League has become so significant for Arne Slot’s Liverpool",
    "description": "Slot struggled to explain Liverpool’s poor league form but a strong end to the season will take the spotlight off the beleaguered manager",
    "fullText": "Liverpool have only lost once in their last 14 games. They sit fourth in the Champions League table, level on points with Real Madrid, above Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona. Their last two European nights have brought away wins over Inter and Marseille.\n\nIt is not the whole picture, though; it cannot be, when they are sixth in the Premier League, 14 points off the pace. A long unbeaten run came to an end at Bournemouth on Saturday. It brought a chorus of criticism: the “outside noise”, as Arne Slot called it. Much of it is concentrated around him. A title-winning manager may have lost the backing of some Liverpool supporters; it can seem so at such times. And if part of the issue is that too many of those 13 undefeated matches were actually draws that produced frustration, Slot is aware that if victories bring respite, setbacks prompt another outcry. Which, in itself, is revealing. The soundtrack can reflect a dissatisfaction with him.\n\n“I think it's going to be really difficult to quiet the outside noise with the position we are in in the league so even if we win a few games, every loss or every disappointing result will start the noise coming back again,” he said. “That's what you can expect if you started the season as we did; not started, but at a certain moment with so many losses. So it's impossible to shut down the noise at a club like this if you are not competing for the league.”\n\nWhich Liverpool are not. Slot pointed out that Liverpool have only won it twice in three decades; as is his wont, he tried to offset talk of their £450m spending last summer by saying they brought in £300m. Yet others of his numbers stood up to less scrutiny.\n\nHe argued Liverpool are suffering from competing on multiple fronts and turned his attention to last season’s Champions League. “This is not going to be a popular opinion but I am going to tell you: maybe the reason why we won the league last season is that we had to play Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16,” he said. “Because as you know they beat us and [then] we had every time a week to prepare for our game.”\n\nYet when PSG eliminated Liverpool, they were 15 points clear in the Premier League, with only nine games to go; it would have taken an almighty collapse to stop them from becoming champions.\n\nBut it can represent part of a picture of a manager grasping for explanations. If the league table never lies, one suggests Liverpool are the fourth best team in Europe, the other that they are only the sixth finest in England. Slot suggested one is the consequence of the other. “I think the biggest struggle we have is that we have to play in both leagues, which is what we want, by the way,” he said. “But too many times after a Champions League game we’ve lost. A lot of away games included.” Indeed, Liverpool have four defeats on the weekends after European fixtures, each on the road.\n\nSlot felt exhaustion caught up with them in the final minutes at Bournemouth. They can seem permanently stretched, their expensive revamp leaving them with a squad that was too small and then further reduced by injuries. “It's almost constantly the same players that have to play,” said Slot, who is down to one available centre-back for Wednesday’s game with Qarabag, in captain Virgil van Dijk. Win that, and at least Liverpool have two midweeks off in February and an immediate passage to the last 16.\n\nThe stakes for the remainder of their season are considerable. Champions League qualification has a huge financial importance; there is also the question if Slot regains the faith of the more angry among the fanbase and retains it of the quiet figures in the boardroom.\n\nAll of which could depend on whether Liverpool find a formula. “I think in between the boxes. we are a very, very, very, very good team,” said Slot. “But there is a complete disbalance in how many times we arrive in promising positions and how many times other teams arrive there. But there is not a disbalance in the goals that are scored and that's a very bad cocktail. If we can only improve in one box, then it's going to be probably an acceptable season, but not more than that. And if we can't improve in both boxes, it's going to be a lot of noise throughout the whole season.”\n\nBut what constitutes acceptable? Five months ago, it might have involved retaining the title, or at least coming close. Now that is impossible; so, too, a Carabao Cup run. The Champions League and FA Cup offer the only chances of silverware. Sixth in the Premier League seems unacceptable.\n\n“I have my opinion about what is acceptable, but I am not going to share that,” said Slot. The outside noise, however, will reveal the wider world’s view. The inside noise in the corridors of power may be quieter but more significant.",

    "fullText": "The South Bay Lakers continued an extended homestand on Tuesday when they hosted the College Park Skyhawks. They came in with a 6-6 record and looked to go over .500 after losing five of their six previous games.\n\nThey fell behind 35-24 at the end of the first quarter and looked to be in trouble. They still trailed 68-60 at halftime, but afterward, South Bay clamped down defensively and held the Skyhawks to just 39 second-half points, allowing it to come away with a 121-107 victory.\n\nOverall, it held the Skyhawks to 39.6% shooting from the field and 28.9% from 3-point range, and it forced 19 turnovers while scoring 29 points off those miscues. Seven of its players scored in double figures, and it had a robust total of 28 assists.\n\nThe Lakers' starting backcourt of R.J. Davis and Kobe Bufkin shot a combined 11-of-32 from the field, but they combined for 11 assists against just three turnovers. Rookie Augustas Marciulionis had 10 assists off the bench, and big man Kylor Kelley grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked six shots.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: South Bay Lakers recap: G League Lakers get easy win over Skyhawks",

    "description": "Three days after a lopsided loss against another ranked opponent, the Utes put forth a much better effort against the Mountaineers.",
    "fullText": "The Utah women’s basketball team was determined to make up for a humbling, lopsided loss last Saturday against Texas Tech.\n\nNo. 22 West Virginia just so happened to be the team standing between the Utes and a get-right game, as Utah beat the Mountaineers 71-64 Tuesday night at the Huntsman Center.\n\n“This one was kind of personal. I think a lot of us had a bad taste in our mouth. ... It’s not that we brush that loss under the rug or anything, we learn from it, most importantly,” Utah junior forward Reese Ross said.\n\n“It’s so huge that we’re able to get another opportunity just within 48 hours. Being able to adjust, it shows growth and determination, trust, and all these things that are going to carry into postseason.”\n\nThe Utes (15-6, 6-3 Big 12) started slow offensively, but unlike the loss to the Red Raiders, they relied on their defense to help them build confidence in a difficult matchup.\n\nWest Virginia (17-5, 7-3 Big 12) shot 41.3% in the game, but only 33.3% in the first quarter, and that helped Utah, which gave up 77 points to the Red Raiders three days earlier, lead from the get-go against the Mountaineers.\n\nOnce the Utes’ offense kicked into high gear, it was Utah’s night to shine.\n\nThe Utes shot 54% from the field, including 10 of 18 from 3-point range.\n\nThe Mountaineers, meanwhile, hit just 2 of 12 3s, the primary difference in a game where Utah led by as many as 18 points in the third quarter, then fended off a rally from West Virginia in the fourth.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the Utes’ ability to hit 3s that helped turned the tide in their favor — oftentimes, those outside shots came at critical moments.\n\nThe Mountaineers used a 7-0 run to start the fourth quarter to make it a 55-49 game, but Ross responded with a 3, then after a Utah free throw from Brooke Walker, LA Sneed added a triple of her own. Like that, the double-digit lead was restored.\n\nWest Virginia cut it to five in the final minute, but again, the Utes had an answer.\n\n“(I’m) just extremely proud of our players, our coaching staff, for turning the page after a not-so-great performance on Saturday, and just getting back to Utah basketball — being connected, playing with intensity, locked in focus, and just competing,\" Utah coach Gavin Petersen said.\n\n“Just really proud of our players for putting that game aside. That’s hard to do, especially when you lose at home, but we bounced back and so extremely proud. That’s a really good team, West Virginia.”\n\nOn the opposite bench, Mountaineers coach Mark Kellogg, who saw his team score 91 points in a win over BYU in Provo last Saturday, said his team struggled to match the Utes’ intensity.\n\n“They punched us early. Stayed with that the basically the entire night. We made a couple little runs there in the second half, but that first half was not very good from our standards,” he said.\n\n“We knew they would come in disappointed after their last game. Wanted to make sure we kind of match that intensity. We did not.”\n\nOne of those players who set that tone was Sneed, the true freshman.\n\nShe scored in double-digits for the fourth time this season, leading Utah with 15 points, just two off her career high. Sneed made 5 of 6 from the field, 3 of 4 from 3 and added three assists in a game that showcased the kind of confidence she is finding midway through her first college season.\n\n“I feel like I just wasn’t hesitating anymore, just letting the ball fly, and obviously it went in,” Sneed said. “But also, my teammates just relay confidence in me. And I think just seeing our our offense flow and our defense flow and the flow of the game, I just went in and did what I needed to do.”\n\nRoss, meanwhile, added her fourth double-double of the season with 12 points and 10 rebounds, setting the physical tone that Utah needed against one of the toughest remaining opponents on Utah’s regular-season schedule. She also had a team-high four assists.\n\nChrya Evans (12 points, three rebounds, three assists) and Lani White (14 points, three rebounds) also played critical roles in helping Utah earn its second win over a ranked opponent this season.\n\nJordan Harrison led the Mountaineers with 18 points, eight assists and seven rebounds.\n\nOn this night, though, it was a balanced Utah effort — and responding well from a soul-searching loss a few nights earlier — that powered the Utes to victory.\n\nPetersen praised his team for their ability to shake off the previous game and its offensive woes that night — when Utah shot just 32.7% — and show that those struggles wouldn’t carry over.\n\n“You got to have some courage. You’re going to make it or miss it, right? It’s a 50/50, chance,” the coach said. “You got to have the courage to be able to miss those shots, and when you get beyond like, is it a good shot, then shoot it.\n\n“I think our younger kids are starting to figure that out. It’s more about the shot quality, because over time and how we train, more often than not we believe it’s going to go in.”",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX (AP) — Mark Williams scored 27 points, Dillon Brooks had 26 and the short-handed Suns beat the Brooklyn Nets 106-102 on Tuesday night in a game that featured a scuffle late in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter Brooks put the Suns ahead 104-102 on two free throws with 1:23 remaining, a steal by the Suns’ Royce O’Neale led to a scramble for the ball in the paint. Brooks tried to wrestle the ball away from Ziaire Williams after the whistle, and the Nets’ Egor Demin pushed Brooks.\n\nSeveral players started jawing at each other and assistant coaches from both sides gathered on the floor as officials tried to restore order. Demin, Mann and Michael Porter Jr. received technical fouls for the Nets, and the Suns’ Grayson Allen and O’Neale also got technicals. Brooks did not receive a technical after getting one earlier in the game.\n\nAllen added 18 points for the short-handed Suns, who ended a two-game skid. Devin Booker missed his second straight game after rolling his right ankle in a loss at Atlanta on Friday night, and Jalen Green also sat with a nagging right hamstring injury.\n\nPorter finished with a season-high 36 points for the Nets, who have lost six straight and 14 of 16. Demin added 15 points, but Brooklyn struggled to find secondary scoring.\n\nWhen Porter made a 3-pointer with 9:47 left in the third quarter, he had 12 of the Nets’ 24 baskets for 27 points.\n\nPhoenix led 91-81 midway through the fourth, but Brooklyn responded with a 19-5 run capped by Porter’s 3 for a 100-96 lead with 3:33 left. Williams scored four quick points for Phoenix and then Allen tied it at 102-all with 1:39 remaining.\n\nNets: At Denver on Thursday night.\n\nSuns: Host Detroit on Thursday night.",

    "description": "High school boys basketball: Highland runs away from Olympus in 5A showdown of top 3 teams",
    "fullText": "Highland coach Chris Jones said he believes when teams arrive at Olympus for a boys basketball game, most of the time they’ve already lost before stepping on the floor.\n\n“I mean, 99% of the teams that get off the bus don’t think they can come in here and win,” said Jones. “So I’ve been preaching, preaching, preaching for three years, you got to think you can beat them. And if you think you can beat them, then you got a half a chance.”\n\nFortunately for Jones, not only do his Highland players think they can beat Olympus, they know they can.\n\nHighland beat Olympus 64-58 on Tuesday night in relatively dominant fashion, its second straight win on the Titans’ home floor after winning 50-47 a year ago.\n\nThe Rams led by as many as 19 points early in the fourth quarter and then held off a furious rally by the Titans to secure the region split after Olympus won the first meeting back in December 77-72.\n\n“It got a bit sweaty there,” said Jones about the fourth quarter.\n\nThe teams, who were ranked No. 2 and 3 in 5A coming into Tuesday’s game, have now split the season series in three straight years.\n\nIf they meet in the playoffs for a third straight time next month, Jones hopes Tuesday’s performance strengthens his team’s belief that it can beat Olympus in the postseason too.\n\n“They kicked our butts in the state tournament when it matters (two straight year). But you know, hopefully we get a chance to play them again,” said Jones.\n\nHighland never trailed on Tuesday as it shot 47% from the field led by Jordan Oberholtzer’s 20 points and Grady Lee’s 17. Bodie Dodge added 15 points as the Rams improved to 16-2 on the season while the Titans dropped to 16-2 as well.\n\n“I’m just so happy for Highland and the community. They’ve bought in so much the last four or five years what we’re trying to do,” said Jones. “Olympus is the crème de la crème. They’re the best there is. They’ve been the best for 10 years. And so just a chance to be able to compete with them and play with them and give them a game—not many people give them a game.”\n\nHighland led by 13-7 at the end of the first quarter, 26-17 at the half and then 43-31 heading into the fourth.\n\nJones admits his team was a bit fortunate that Olympus leading scorer Gavin Lowe — who averages 25 points — missed all seven of his shots in the first half and went scoreless. But at the same time, he said it was the result of a much tougher defensive performance than the first time around when Olympus had five players score in double figures.\n\n“They have Gavin, who is elite, elite, elite, but they’re also big. And they got a bunch of guys that are big, and we got a bunch of guards. So our thought was, we got to pressure them. We can’t let those big guys just stand around and pass and throw high-low on us because last game they killed us on high-low because we were soft,” said Jones.\n\nThat wasn’t the case in the rematch as Highland was elite definitely in the first three quarters holding Olympus to 36 percent shooting and just 3-of-16 from 3-point range.\n\nDown nine at halftime, the Titans came out and tried to press their way back into the game, but the Rams — who Jones jokes are a team with four point guards and a big — handle it well and extended the lead to double digits heading into the fourth.\n\n“We did a great job against their press. I mean, they got a couple, but we scored plenty on their press. And we just wanted to get up and down the court and play with them,” said Jones.\n\nHighland opened the fourth on a 9-2 run as Oberholtzer and Isaiah Drisdom drained 3s, and Oberholtzer converted a 3-point play after a difficult finish at the rim.\n\nFor Olympus, trailing 52-33 with 5:25 remaining was the final wake-up call, and it finally started hitting shots — particularly 3-pointers.\n\nLowe and Caden Jackson both made a pair of 3s over the next five minutes, while Adam Bywater made another as Olympus whittled the lead all the way to 63-58 with 15 seconds left in the game.\n\nThe Titans forced a turnover on the ensuing inbounds pass and got a good look at 3-pointer that could’ve made it a one-possession game with 12 seconds left, but the shot rattled out and Highland corralled the rebound to finish off the win.\n\nLowe finished with 18 points in the loss as he scored all of his points in the second half. Jackson added 13.",

But players sales, nothing, new player arrivals, nothing. There’s time left, and maybe this means the club will be pretty active on transfer deadline day!\n\nA lot can still happen, and it looks like even the Jeremy Jacquet situation could still spark up. Chelsea have been trying to sign the centre back from Rennes this window, but have so far not managed to.\n\nJeremy Jacquet playing for Rennes. (Photo by Chris Lee/Chelsea FC)\n\nSky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg posted on X last night and said:\n\n‘Bayern are currently not in negotiations with Jeremy #Jacquet’s management or Stade Rennes over an early transfer in the summer.\n\n“Bayern are monitoring the situation and remain interested for the summer, but nothing more at this stage. The focus is on extending Dayot Upamecano’s contract. Other (optional) centre-backs under contract: Tah, Kim, Ito, Stanisic.\n\n“Chelsea are not giving up. They are pushing hard to find a solution before Deadline Day.”\n\nLiam Rosenior has he pre-match press conference last night for the Napoli game tonight, and he confirmed that he is due to have some talks with a Chelsea defender who was recalled from his loan spell later this week.\n\nHe also said that Moises Caicedo plays like a 35-year-old which is actually a back-handed compliment for the midfielder!",

    "fullText": "Tuesday night in the NBA delivered drama, big performances, and tight finishes. Several teams snapped losing streaks, while others struggled to close games. Young stars made noise and veterans stepped up when needed. From last-second free throws to fourth-quarter takeovers, the night had a bit of everything. Here is a breakdown of the winners and losers from all the games.\n\nWashington finally snapped its nine-game losing streak with a tough home win. Alex Sarr led the way with 29 points, 12 rebounds, and six blocks, staying aggressive all night. Kyshawn George and Bub Carrington made big plays late, while Khris Middleton calmly iced the game at the line. Even after getting crushed on the boards, the Wizards found timely buckets and ended a home losing run against Portland that stretched back to 2017.\n\nPortland dominated the glass but couldn’t finish the job. Shaedon Sharpe scored 31 points, and Donovan Clingan added 14 points and 20 rebounds. Deni Avdija had a solid return with 17 points and 12 boards. Missed free throws and another late collapse cost them a winnable game.\n\nNew York owned the fourth quarter by outscoring Sacramento 31-15. Jalen Brunson led the charge with 28 points and took control late. Karl-Anthony Towns added 17 points and 11 rebounds. Mikal Bridges chipped in with 18 points and OG Anunoby had 15. The Knicks forced the pace and turned defense into offense. Mike Brown also earned his first win against Sacramento since leaving the team. Even with 21 turnovers, New York stayed composed when it mattered most.\n\nSacramento lost its sixth straight game and struggled badly from deep. The team shot just 5 of 30 from three-point range. DeMar DeRozan scored 34 points but had little help. Russell Westbrook added 14 points but could not spark a rally. Their offense went cold in the fourth quarter and they could not keep up with New York’s run. Poor shooting and weak defense in the final period sealed their fate.\n\nPhiladelphia bounced back after a blowout loss the night before. Paul George scored 32 points and hit nine three-pointers. Joel Embiid had 29 points and scored 18 in the first quarter alone. Tyrese Maxey added 22 points and kept the offense moving. The Sixers played with fresh energy after both stars returned from rest. Their shooting and ball movement overwhelmed Milwaukee. The win also showed how different this team looks with its main players healthy.\n\nMilwaukee played without Giannis Antetokounmpo and felt his absence. Myles Turner scored 31 points and Ryan Rollins added 24, but defense was the issue. The Bucks allowed too many open looks from three. Bobby Portis and Kyle Kuzma each had 17 points but could not stop the Sixers’ runs. Injuries continued to hurt their rhythm and depth.\n\nOklahoma City avoided a third straight loss despite missing several key players. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 29 points and stayed perfect at the line. Chet Holmgren delivered 20 points, 14 rebounds, and five blocks. Isaiah Joe added 17 points off the bench. The Thunder stayed steady during a late Pelicans push. Strong defense and patience helped them close the game.\n\nNew Orleans could not finish its comeback after cutting the lead to five. Zion Williamson had 21 points and 11 rebounds on efficient shooting. Saddiq Bey added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Tempers flared late and the flow of the game slipped away from them. Missed chances in the final minutes cost them a third-quarter rally.\n\nDetroit continued its strong run and held off a late Denver charge. Tobias Harris scored 22 points and hit two clutch free throws. Cade Cunningham finished with 22 points and 11 assists. The Pistons built an early lead and survived missed shots down the stretch. Their balance and poise showed again in a tight finish.\n\nDenver struggled with travel issues and missing players. Jamal Murray had 24 points and 10 assists but missed key free throws late. Jonas Valanciunas posted 16 points and 16 rebounds in his return. Fatigue and injuries hurt their execution. The rally fell short after several missed chances.\n\nPhoenix won despite missing key scorers. Mark Williams had 27 points and Dillon Brooks added 26. Grayson Allen chipped in with 18 points. The Suns survived a late Nets run and closed the game with defense and free throws. Even after a scuffle broke out, they stayed focused and finished strong.\n\nBrooklyn lost its sixth straight game. Michael Porter Jr. scored a season-high 36 points but got little support. Egor Demin added 15 points. The Nets could not hold a late lead and struggled with second scoring options. Emotions ran high and technical fouls did not help their cause.\n\nThe Clippers erased an early deficit with a huge second and third quarter. Kawhi Leonard led the comeback and stayed steady late. Kris Dunn sparked a big third-quarter surge with defense and playmaking. Los Angeles outscored Utah 36-20 in the third and never looked back. The win moved them closer to a .500 record.\n\nUtah started fast but faded after halftime. Lauri Markkanen led early but struggled later. The Jazz could not handle the Clippers’ pressure defense. Scoring dried up in the second half and the lead slipped away quickly. Another loss showed their trouble finishing games.\n\nJanuary 27 brought strong wins for teams like Washington, New York, and Philadelphia. Young stars like Alex Sarr and Chet Holmgren made a clear impact. Veteran leaders such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George also delivered when needed. On the losing side, missed free throws and cold shooting proved costly for several teams. The night showed how small moments can decide close NBA games.\n\nThe post NBA results: January 27, 2026 – winners and losers appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile the Los Angeles Rams enjoyed a successful season that ended one win shy of the Super Bowl, they also quietly turned their kicking situation into a feel-good story.\n\nHarrison Mevis, affectionately known as “The Thiccer Kicker,” finished a standout year in Los Angeles, one that was fueled as much by patience and preparation as performance.\n\nMevis was cut by the Jets before the regular season but continued to prepare each week as if he would be lining up kicks on an NFL field every Sunday. That approach paid off. He converted 18 of 19 field-goal attempts, including the playoffs, and was perfect on all 48 extra points.\n\nMORE: Rams predicted to nab star NFC South cornerback in free agency\n\nThe opportunity — and the results — meant “everything” to him.“I think you, you kind of saw the results there,” Mevis said, according to therams.com. “It works. It's a lot like golf and you kinda keep it simple and you'll make kicks. Don't overcomplicate it.”\n\nMevis credited punter and holder Ethan Evans, long snapper Jake McQuaide, and the protection unit for helping make his season possible. Before landing with the Rams, Mevis spent time with the Jets, Panthers, and the UFL’s Birmingham Stallions.\n\nMORE: Bills head coach hire of Joe Brady is great news for Broncos, Rams, Titans\n\nFresh off the conclusion of the season, Mevis said he hasn’t yet given much thought to his long-term future with the Rams or in the league.

    "fullText": "Every friend I have with a job that involves picking up something heavier than a laptop more than twice a week eventually finds a way to slip something like this into conversation: “Bro,1[1] you don’t work hard. I just worked a 4700-hour week digging a tunnel under Mordor with a screwdriver.”\n\nThey have a point. Mordor sucks, and it’s certainly more physically taxing to dig a tunnel than poke at a keyboard unless you’re an ant. But, for the sake of the argument, can we agree that stress and insanity are bad things? Awesome. Welcome to programming.\n\nImagine joining an engineering team. You’re excited and full of ideas, probably just out of school and a world of clean, beautiful designs, awe-inspiring in their aesthetic unity of purpose, economy, and strength. You start by meeting Mary, project leader for a bridge in a major metropolitan area. Mary introduces you to Fred, after you get through the fifteen security checks installed by Dave because Dave had his sweater stolen off his desk once and Never Again. Fred only works with wood, so you ask why he’s involved because this bridge is supposed to allow rush-hour traffic full of cars full of mortal humans to cross a 200-foot drop over rapids. Don’t worry, says Mary, Fred’s going to handle the walkways. What walkways? Well Fred made a good case for walkways and they’re going to add to the bridge’s appeal. Of course, they’ll have to be built without railings, because there’s a strict no railings rule enforced by Phil, who’s not an engineer. Nobody’s sure what Phil does, but it’s definitely full of synergy and has to do with upper management, whom none of the engineers want to deal with so they just let Phil do what he wants. Sara, meanwhile, has found several hemorrhaging-edge paving techniques, and worked them all into the bridge design, so you’ll have to build around each one as the bridge progresses, since each one means different underlying support and safety concerns. Tom and Harry have been working together for years, but have an ongoing feud over whether to use metric or imperial measurements, and it’s become a case of “whoever got to that part of the design first.” This has been such a headache for the people actually screwing things together, they’ve given up and just forced, hammered, or welded their way through the day with whatever parts were handy. Also, the bridge was designed as a suspension bridge, but nobody actually knew how to build a suspension bridge, so they got halfway through it and then just added extra support columns to keep the thing standing, but they left the suspension cables because they’re still sort of holding up parts of the bridge. Nobody knows which parts, but everybody’s pretty sure they’re important parts. After the introductions are made, you are invited to come up with some new ideas, but you don’t have any because you’re a propulsion engineer and don’t know anything about bridges.\n\nWould you drive across this bridge? No. If it somehow got built, everybody involved would be executed. Yet some version of this dynamic wrote every single program you have ever used, banking software, websites, and a ubiquitously used program that was supposed to protect information on the internet but didn’t.\n\nEvery programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.\n\nThis file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.\n\nEvery programmer starts out writing some perfect little snowflake like this. Then they’re told on Friday they need to have six hundred snowflakes written by Tuesday, so they cheat a bit here and there and maybe copy a few snowflakes and try to stick them together or they have to ask a coworker to work on one who melts it and then all the programmers’ snowflakes get dumped together in some inscrutable shape and somebody leans a Picasso on it because nobody wants to see the cat urine soaking into all your broken snowflakes melting in the light of day. Next week, everybody shovels more snow on it to keep the Picasso from falling over.\n\nThere’s a theory that you can cure this by following standards, except there are more “standards” than there are things computers can actually do, and these standards are all variously improved and maligned by the personal preferences of the people coding them, so no collection of code has ever made it into the real world without doing a few dozen identical things a few dozen not even remotely similar ways. The first few weeks of any job are just figuring out how a program works even if you’re familiar with every single language, framework, and standard that’s involved, because standards are unicorns.\n\nI spent a few years growing up with a closet in my bedroom. The closet had an odd design. It looked normal at first, then you walked in to do closet things, and discovered that the wall on your right gave way to an alcove, making for a handy little shelf. Then you looked up, and the wall at the back of the alcove gave way again, into a crawlspace of utter nothingness, where no light could fall and which you immediately identified as the daytime retreat for every ravenous monster you kept at bay with flashlights and stuffed animals each night.\n\nThis is what it is to learn programming. You get to know your useful tools, then you look around, and there are some handy new tools nearby and those tools show you the bottomless horror that was always right next to your bed.\n\nFor example, say you’re an average web developer. You’re familiar with a dozen programming languages, tons of helpful libraries, standards, protocols, what have you. You still have to learn more at the rate of about one a week, and remember to check the hundreds of things you know to see if they’ve been updated or broken and make sure they all still work together and that nobody fixed the bug in one of them that you exploited to do something you thought was really clever one weekend when you were drunk. You’re all up to date, so that’s cool, then everything breaks.\n\n“Double you tee eff?” you say, and start hunting for the problem. You discover that one day, some idiot decided that since another idiot decided that 1/0 should equal infinity, they could just use that as a shorthand for “Infinity” when simplifying their code. Then a non-idiot rightly decided that this was idiotic, which is what the original idiot should have decided, but since he didn’t, the non-idiot decided to be a dick and make this a failing error in his new compiler. Then he decided he wasn’t going to tell anyone that this was an error, because he’s a dick, and now all your snowflakes are urine and you can’t even find the cat.\n\nYou are an expert in all these technologies, and that’s a good thing, because that expertise let you spend only six hours figuring out what went wrong, as opposed to losing your job. You now have one extra little fact to tuck away in the millions of little facts you have to memorize because so many of the programs you depend on are written by dicks and idiots.\n\nAnd that’s just in your own chosen field, which represents such a tiny fraction of all the things there are to know in computer science you might as well never have learned anything at all. Not a single living person knows how everything in your five-year-old MacBook actually works. Why do we tell you to turn it off and on again? Because we don’t have the slightest clue what’s wrong with it, and it’s really easy to induce coma in computers and have their built-in team of automatic doctors try to figure it out for us. The only reason coders’ computers work better than non-coders’ computers is coders know computers are schizophrenic little children with auto-immune diseases and we don’t beat them when they’re bad.\n\nRemember that stuff about crazy people and bad code? The internet is that except it’s literally a billion times worse. Websites that are glorified shopping carts with maybe three dynamic pages are maintained by teams of people around the clock, because the truth is everything is breaking all the time, everywhere, for everyone. Right now someone who works for Facebook is getting tens of thousands of error messages and frantically trying to find the problem before the whole charade collapses. There’s a team at a Google office that hasn’t slept in three days. Somewhere there’s a database programmer surrounded by empty Mountain Dew bottles whose husband thinks she’s dead. And if these people stop, the world burns. Most people don’t even know what sysadmins do, but trust me, if they all took a lunch break at the same time they wouldn’t make it to the deli before you ran out of bullets protecting your canned goods from roving bands of mutants.\n\nYou can’t restart the internet. Trillions of dollars depend on a rickety cobweb of unofficial agreements and “good enough for now” code with comments like “TODO: FIX THIS IT’S A REALLY DANGEROUS HACK BUT I DON’T KNOW WHAT’S WRONG” that were written ten years ago. I haven’t even mentioned the legions of people attacking various parts of the internet for espionage and profit or because they’re bored. Ever heard of 4chan? 4chan might destroy your life and business because they decided they didn’t like you for an afternoon, and we don’t even worry about 4chan because another nuke doesn’t make that much difference in a nuclear winter.\n\nOn the internet, it’s okay to say, “You know, this kind of works some of the time if you’re using the right technology,” and BAM! it’s part of the internet now. Anybody with a couple of hundred dollars and a computer can snag a little bit of the internet and put up whatever awful chunks of hack code they want and then attach their little bit to a bunch of big bits and everything gets a little bit worse. Even the good coders don’t bother to learn the arcane specifications outlined by the organizations people set up to implement some unicorns, so everybody spends half their time coping with the fact that nothing matches anything or makes any sense and might break at any time and we just try to cover it up and hope no one notices.\n\nHere are the secret rules of the internet: five minutes after you open a web browser for the first time, a kid in Russia has your social security number. Did you A computer at the NSA now automatically tracks your physical location for the rest of your life. Sent an email? Your email address just went up on a billboard in Nigeria.\n\nThese things aren’t true because we don’t care and don’t try to stop them, they’re true because everything is broken because there’s no good code and everybody’s just trying to keep it running. That’s your job if you work with the internet: hoping the last thing you wrote is good enough to survive for a few hours so you can eat dinner and catch a nap.\n\nFunny, right? No? How about this exchange:\n\nWasn’t that guy helpful? With the camel? Doesn’t that seem like an appropriate response? No? Good. You can still find Jesus. You have not yet spent so much of your life reading code that you begin to talk in it. The human brain isn’t particularly good at basic logic and now there’s a whole career in doing nothing but really, really complex logic. Vast chains of abstract conditions and requirements have to be picked through to discover things like missing commas. Doing this all day leaves you in a state of mild aphasia as you look at people’s faces while they’re speaking and you don’t know they’ve finished because there’s no semicolon. You immerse yourself in a world of total meaninglessness where all that matters is a little series of numbers went into a giant labyrinth of symbols and a different series of numbers or a picture of a kitten came out the other end.\n\nThe destructive impact on the brain is demonstrated by the programming languages people write. This is a program:\n\nThat program does exactly the same thing as this program:\n\nAnd once somebody wrote a programming language that let somebody else write this:\n\nAccording to the author, that program is \"two lines of code that parse two lines of embedded comments in the code to read the Mayan numbers representing the individual ASCII characters that make up the magazine title, rendered in 90-degree rotated ASCII art.\"\n\nThat program won a contest, because of course it did. Do you want to live in a world like this? No. This is a world where you can smoke a pack a day and nobody even questions it. \"Of course he smokes a pack a day, who wouldn't?\" Eventually every programmer wakes up and before they're fully conscious they see their whole world and every relationship in it as chunks of code, and they trade stories about it as if sleepiness triggering acid trips is a normal thing that happens to people. This is a world where people eschew sex to write a programming language for orangutans. All programmers are forcing their brains to do things brains were never meant to do in a situation they can never make better, ten to fifteen hours a day, five to seven days a week, and every one of them is slowly going mad.\n\nSo no, I’m not required to be able to lift objects weighing up to fifty pounds. I traded that for the opportunity to trim Satan’s pubic hair while he dines out of my open skull so a few bits of the internet will continue to work for a few more days.\n\n(Update: now available in Greek, Czech, Italian, Russian, Portuguese, Hungarian, French, Hebrew (PDF by Ilil Hoz), German (PDF by Kurt Frock), Spanish, and Chinese)",

    "description": "I got nerd-sniped right before work and just had to write this post.",
    "fullText": "I got nerd-sniped right before work and just had to write this post.\n\nIn AI code and software craft, Alex looks at AI through the lens of Jacques Ellul’s “technique.”\n\nJacques Ellul describes his concept of “technique” as the reduction of activity to a set of efficient means to a measured and defined end — a way of thinking dominant in modernity.\n\nHe argues that an arts and crafts style movement that focuses on craftsmanship can stave off the totality of technique. I’m all for arts and crafts, but that view is at odds with Ellul’s view. Ellul believed that technique was “inevitable” and all-consuming and unstoppable, like the smoke monster in Lost.\n\nAndrew Feenberg’s viewpoint is actually \n\nFor example, the “technique” of the 19th-century factory was brutal efficiency. But through unions and laws (human agency), we forced the technique to adapt to child labor laws and safety standards. Efficiency was curbed by social values.\n\nFeenberg showed us a few ways to push back against Technique.\n\nDonald Knuth, a renowned computer scientist, invented literate programming, which redefined the way we write code – by putting us humans first. In literate programming you start with prose and interject code, rather than writing code and sprinkling in comments. He inverted the existing model from speed of implementation to ease of understanding.\n\nSimilarly, Feenberg would redefine AI by building AI tools that optimize for maintainability, readability, and beauty.\n\nIn the 1980s, the French government distributed the Minitel (a proto-internet terminal) to millions of homes. The technique goal was bureaucratic efficiency: to modernize the phone directory and deliver government information. It was cold, rational, and top-down.\n\nInstead, users hacked the system. They ignored the government directories and turned the network into a massive, chaotic instant-messaging service. They used the machine for flirting, arguing, and socializing. The users subverted the rational design. They took a tool of control and turned it into a tool of communication.\n\nIn other words, don’t just boycott AI. Misuse it.\n\nFeenberg distinguishes between two layers of technology. To overcome technique, we have to re-integrate them. The primary instrumentalization is the raw technical aspect. For code that means purely technical, decontextualized logic. The second instrumentalization is social, aesthetic, and ethical context. The code is elegant and respects the user’s privacy. To unify the two, we must demand that the second instrumentalization be integrated into the first.\n\nWennerberg is right to identify the “slop” as a threat, but wrong to suggest we can defeat it with nostalgia. Retreating to “software arts and crafts” doesn’t change anything (I’m still for it though); it merely leaves the engine of modern society running on autopilot, optimized only for profit.\n\nFeenberg offers a harder, but more effective path: don’t abandon the machine – hack it. By embedding human values into our definitions of efficiency and refusing to accept raw functionality as the final standard, we stop being victims of technique. The goal is not to escape the future, but to shape it.\n\nNow it’s time for me to go write some code.",

    "description": "LVMH is pushing Tiffany toward gold and high jewelry, where it sees higher demand, and away from silver jewelry.",
    "fullText": "Gold girlies, rejoice: Tiffany & Co. will be moving away from silver jewelry.\n\nThe New York-based luxury jewelry company is pivoting away from silver jewelry and going all in on gold and high jewelry, executives from its parent company LVMH said in a Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\"Tiffany had excellent products, but we redirected the house so that it can develop in jewelry and high jewelry, fewer silver products,\" said Bernard Arnault, the French luxury giant's CEO.\n\nLVMH's group managing director, Stéphane Bianchi, said Tiffany is \"hugely focused\" on silver products, but the group is pushing the brand toward gold and high jewelry. High jewelry is crafted from precious metals like gold and rare gemstones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.\n\nBianchi said demand for high jewelry has quadrupled over the last four years, while demand for silver jewelry has declined by a third since LVMH acquired Tiffany in 2021. The $15.8 billion acquisition was LVMH's biggest to date.\n\nThis is a significant shift for Tiffany, which has specialized in silver throughout its history. It was the first American company to use the British standard for 92% pure silver in its jewelry in 1851.\n\nAnd its first international recognition came from the 1867 Paris Exposition, where the company was awarded for its silverware.\n\nTiffany is part of LVMH's watches and jewelry division. In LVMH's latest earnings report, the division reported €10.5 billion in sales, or about $12.6 billion, in 2025, a 1% decline from the previous year. LVMH's stock price is down about 22% in the past year.\n\nRepresentatives for Tiffany and LVMH did not respond to queries from Business Insider about how this change would affect the supply of Tiffany's existing silver products.\n\nTiffany's shift comes amid a historic rally in the precious metals complex.\n\nGold and silver prices have surged to record highs over the past year, driven by geopolitical tensions linked to President Donald Trump's trade agenda, aggressive central-bank buying, and FOMO-fueled retail demand.\n\nSpot gold broke above $3,000 per troy ounce in March, climbed to $4,000 in October, and smashed past $5,000 earlier this week. Gold prices are up about 20% so far this year after surging 73% in 2025, and are currently trading around $5,240 per ounce.\n\nSilver has followed gold's meteoric rise, with speculative frenzy — particularly from China — fueling a red-hot rally. The price of the white metal breached $100 per ounce last week and is now trading around $115.\n\nSilver's gains have far outpaced gold's. Spot silver is up 56% year to date after soaring 170% last year.\n\nThe white metal's rapid ascent has left it looking stretched relative to gold, which has historically served as a haven asset and store of value.\n\nThe gold-to-silver ratio — which measures how many ounces of silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold — has fallen to a four-year low, signaling that silver now \"appears expensive,\" according to a Monday note from BMI Research.",

Some employees noticed it and shared the information with Business Insider.\n\n\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the accompanying message read. \"The notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization who are based in the US, Canada, and Costa Rica have now been completed.\"\n\n\"Changes like this are hard on everyone,\" Aubrey's message continued. \"These decisions are difficult and are made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success.\"\n\nAmazon plans to cut thousands of corporate roles in coming days, Business Insider previously reported. The reductions would mark the company's second round of mass layoffs since October, when it eliminated roughly 14,000 jobs. An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAfter the calendar invitation landed, confusion spread across an internal Slack channel with more than 36,000 Amazon employees, according to messages viewed by Business Insider. Staff questioned whether the message had been intended for Aubrey's entire organization or only for those whose roles were being eliminated.\n\n\"Am I impacted or sent by mistake to all?\" one employee wrote.\n\nOthers saw the email as confirmation that the expected layoffs were imminent.\n\n\"Well, if you needed solid proof that tomorrow is legit, the project dawn email is it,\" one person wrote. \"Looks like they wanted to use AI to send an email tomorrow and instead it sent a calendar invite today.\"\n\nIt remains unclear which teams will be affected by the cuts.

    "fullText": "In the early planning stages of Disneyland, Walt Disney employed an unconventional research method that would forever change the way theme parks approach waste management. Instead of relying on assumptions, he went straight to the \n\nWalt Disney was known for his meticulous attention to detail, but perhaps less known is his dedication to understanding customer behavior. Before opening Disneyland in 1955, he spent countless hours visiting other amusement parks, not just to study their attractions, but to observe how people interacted with their environment.\n\n\"I've been to amusement parks all over the world,\" Disney once remarked, \"and I've seen what works and what doesn't. But more importantly, I've watched how people behave in these parks – that's where the real lessons are.\"\n\nDuring his research, Disney made a crucial observation about human behavior regarding trash disposal. He noticed a consistent pattern: visitors would carry their garbage for approximately 30 steps before giving up and dropping it on the ground. This wasn't a reflection of bad manners – it was simply human nature when proper disposal options weren't readily available.\n\n\"People won't walk more than 30 steps to put garbage in a container,\" Disney explained to his design team. \"And if they don't see a receptacle within that distance, they'll just drop it wherever they are.\"\n\nThis insight led to one of Disneyland's most fundamental design principles: the \"30-Step Rule.\" Disney mandated that trash cans be placed no more than 30 steps apart throughout the park. He personally supervised the placement of each container, often pacing out the steps himself to ensure optimal positioning.\n\nVan France, one of Disney's original team members, recalled: \"Walt would walk through the park with a hot dog, taking bite after bite, counting the steps until he needed to dispose of the wrapper. He was constantly thinking about the guest experience, down to the smallest detail.\"\n\nToday, decades after Walt Disney's original research, this principle remains a cornerstone of Disney parks worldwide. Visitors can still find a trash receptacle within 30 steps of wherever they stand – a testament to the enduring value of Walt's customer research. Modern Disney parks maintain over 1,000 trash cans per location, with Magic Kingdom alone housing over 2,000 receptacles.\n\nThe trash can study wasn't Disney's only foray into customer research. His commitment to understanding visitor behavior led to several other revolutionary park features:\n\n\"You don't build it for yourself,\" Disney often said. \"You know what people want and you build it for them.\"\n\nThe 30-step rule has influenced public space design well beyond theme parks. Modern urban planners and retail designers frequently cite Disney's research when placing waste receptacles in:\n\nAs Dick Nunis, former Chairman of Walt Disney Attractions, noted: \"Walt's genius wasn't just in creating entertainment – it was in understanding human nature and designing around it.\"\n\nThe 30-step rule demonstrates how foundational research can create lasting solutions. As Disney himself put it: \"When people walk into the park, they don't want to think about trash cans. But they do want a clean park. Our job is to solve problems they didn't even know they had.\"\n\nWhat started as a simple observation became a powerful example of how customer research, when done right, can create solutions that stand the test of time. Walt Disney's approach to the trash can problem wasn't just about keeping the park clean – it was about understanding human nature and designing around it, a principle that continues to influence customer-centric design across industries today.",

    "description": "WhatsApp has adopted and rolled out a new layer of security for users – built with Rust – as part of its effort to harden defenses against malware threats. WhatsApp’s experience creating and distri…",
    "fullText": "WhatsApp provides default end-to-end encryption for over 3 billion people to message securely each and every day. Online security is an adversarial space, and to continue ensuring users can keep messaging securely, we’re constantly adapting and evolving our strategy against cyber-security threats – all while supporting the WhatsApp infrastructure to help people connect.\n\nFor example, WhatsApp, like many other applications, allows users to share media and other types of documents. WhatsApp helps protect users by warning about dangerous attachments like APKs, yet rare and sophisticated malware could be hidden within a seemingly benign file like an image or video. These maliciously crafted files might target unpatched vulnerabilities in the operating system, libraries distributed by the operating system, or the application itself.\n\nTo help protect against such potential threads, WhatsApp is increasingly using the Rust programming language, including in our media sharing functionality. Rust is a memory safe language offering numerous security benefits. We believe that this is the largest rollout globally of any library written in Rust.\n\nTo help explain why and how we rolled this out, we should first look back at a key OS-level vulnerability that sent an important signal to WhatsApp around hardening media-sharing defenses.\n\nIn 2015, Android devices, and the applications that ran on them, became vulnerable to the “Stagefright” vulnerability. The bug lay in the processing of media files by operating system-provided libraries, so WhatsApp and other applications could not patch the underlying vulnerability. Because it could often take months for people to update to the latest version of their software, we set out to find solutions that would keep WhatsApp users safe, even in the event of an operating system vulnerability.\n\nAt that time, we realized that a cross-platform C++ library already developed by WhatsApp to send and consistently format MP4 files (called “wamedia”) could be modified to detect files which do not adhere to the MP4 standard and might trigger bugs in a vulnerable OS library on the receiver side – hence putting a target’s security at risk. We rolled out this check and were able to protect WhatsApp users from the Stagefright vulnerability much more rapidly than by depending on users to update the OS itself.\n\nBut because media checks run automatically on download and process untrusted inputs, we identified early on that wamedia was a prime candidate for using a memory safe language.\n\nRather than an incremental rewrite, we developed the Rust version of wamedia in parallel with the original C++ version. We used differential fuzzing and extensive integration and unit tests to ensure compatibility between the two implementations.\n\nTwo major hurdles were the initial binary size increase due to bringing in the Rust standard library and the build system support required for the diverse platforms supported by WhatsApp. WhatsApp made a long-term bet to build that support. In the end, we replaced 160,000 lines of C++ (excluding tests) with 90,000 lines of Rust (including tests). The Rust version showed performance and runtime memory usage advantages over the C++. Given this success, Rust was fully rolled out to all WhatsApp users and many platforms: Android, iOS, Mac, Web, Wearables, and more. With this positive evidence in hand, memory safe languages will play an ever increasing part in WhatsApp’s overall approach to application and user security.\n\nOver time, we’ve added more checks for non-conformant structures within certain file types to help protect downstream libraries from parser differential exploit attempts. Additionally, we check higher risk file types, even if structurally conformant, for risk indicators. For instance, PDFs are often a vehicle for malware, and more specifically, the presence of embedded files and scripting elements within a PDF further raise risks. We also detect when one file type masquerades as another, through a spoofed extension or MIME type. Finally, we uniformly flag known dangerous file types, such as executables or applications, for special handling in the application UX. Altogether, we call this ensemble of checks “Kaleidoscope.” This system protects people on WhatsApp from potentially malicious unofficial clients and attachments. Although format checks will not stop every attack, this layer of defense helps mitigate many of them.\n\nEach month, these libraries are distributed to billions of phones, laptops, desktops, watches, and browsers running on multiple operating systems for people on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. This is the largest ever deployment of Rust code to a diverse set of end-user platforms and products that we are aware of. Our experience speaks to the production-readiness and unique value proposition of Rust on the client-side.\n\nThis is just one example of WhatsApp’s many investments in security. It’s why we built default end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls, offer end-to-end encrypted backups, and use key transparency technology to verify a secure connection, provide additional calling protections, and more.\n\nWhatsApp has a strong track record of being loud when we find issues and working to hold bad actors accountable. For example, WhatsApp reports CVEs for important issues we find in our applications, even if we do not find evidence of exploitation. We do this to give people on WhatsApp the best chance of protecting themselves by seeing a security advisory and updating quickly.\n\nTo ensure application security, we first must identify and quantify the sources of risk. We do this through internal and external audits like NCC Group’s public assessment of WhatsApp’s end-to-end encrypted backups, fuzzing, static analysis, supply chain management, and automated attack surface analysis. We also recently expanded our Bug Bounty program to introduce the WhatsApp Research Proxy – a tool that makes research into WhatsApp’s network protocol more effective.\n\nNext, we reduce the identified risk. Like many others in the industry, we found that the majority of the high severity vulnerabilities we published were due to memory safety issues in code written in the C and C++ programming languages. To combat this we invest in three parallel strategies:\n\nWhatsApp has added protections like CFI, hardened memory allocators, safer buffer handling APIs, and more. C and C++ developers have specialized security training, development guidelines, and automated security analysis on their changes. We also have strict SLAs for fixing issues uncovered by the risk identification process.\n\nRust enabled WhatsApp’s security team to develop a secure, high performance, cross-platform library to ensure media shared on the platform is consistent and safe across devices. This is an important step forward in adding additional security behind the scenes for users and part of our ongoing defense-in-depth approach. Security teams at WhatsApp and Meta are highlighting opportunities for high impact adoption of Rust to interested teams, and we anticipate accelerating adoption of Rust over the coming years.",

    "fullText": "The AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, co-directed by Daniel Roher, delves into the world of AI through the lens of personal anxiety\n\nAre we barreling toward AI catastrophe? Is AI an existential threat, or an epochal opportunity? Those are the questions top of mind for a new documentary at Sundance, which features leading AI experts, critics and entrepreneurs, including Sam Altman, the OpenAI CEO, with views on the near-to-midterm future ranging from doom to utopia.\n\nThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist, directed by Daniel Roher and Charlie Tyrell and produced by Daniel Kwan (one half of The Daniels, the Oscar-winning duo behind Everything Everywhere All At Once), delves into the contentious topic of AI through Roher’s own anxiety. The Canadian film-maker, who won an Oscar in 2023 for the documentary Navalny, first became interested in the topic while experimenting with tools released by OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot ChatGPT. The sophistication of the public tools – the ability to produce whole paragraphs in seconds, or produce illustrations – both thrilled and unnerved him. AI was already radically shaping the filmmaking industry, and proclamations on the promise and peril of AI were everywhere, with little way for people outside the tech industry to evaluate them. As an artist, he wondered, how was he to make sense of it all?\n\nRoher’s anxiety only increased when he and his wife, fellow film-maker Caroline Lindy, learned that they were expecting their first child. “It felt like the whole world was rushing into something without thinking,” he says in the film, as his excitement for parenthood collided with dread over the unknown variable of AI, which in just a few short years went from proprietary experiment to public good.\n\nThe AI Doc thus arises out of Roher’s most pressing question: is it safe to bring a child into this world? Alongside Kwan, Roher convened a series of experts to both explain the mechanics of the tech – and clarify some nebulous, alienating terms – and search for an answer. (It is both comforting and a little disturbing, for example, that no one seems to have a clear answer to the question “what is AI?”). In individual sit-down interviews, leading machine learning researchers including Yoshua Bengio, Ilya Sutskever and DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg all agree that there are aspects of AI models that humans cannot and will never be able to understand. Standard AI models are trained on “more data than anyone could ever read in several lifetimes”, as one machine learning expert puts it. And the pace of machine learning exceeds that of precedent – or film. “Any example you put in this movie will look absolutely clumsy by the time the movie comes out,” Tristan Harris, co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology and a prominent voice in the apocalyptic 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, tells Roher.\n\nThe film first hears from a series of doomerists, or people concerned AI – and in particular Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a still-theoretical form of AI whose capabilities exceed those of humans – could lead to the extermination of humanity, including Harris, his Center for Humane Technology co-founder Aza Raskin, Ajeya Cotra, an AI risk adviser, and Eli Yudkowsky, an AI alignment pioneer. Such figures warn that humans could very easily lose control of super-intelligent AI models, with little to no recourse. Yudkowsky’s 2025 book is bluntly titled If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.\n\nAI companies, they say, are unprepared for the consequences of reaching AGI, which could “become superhuman maybe in this decade”, says Dan Hendrycks, director of the Center for AI Safety. Should humans no longer be the most intelligent beings on Earth, they warn, it is possible that AGI would view the species as irrelevant. Connor Leahy, co-founder of EleutherAI, compared the potential future relationship of super-intelligent AGI and humans to that of humans and ants: “We don’t hate ants. But if we want to build a highway” over an anthill – “well, sucks for the ant.”\n\nSeveral in the doomer camp, many of whom do not have children, react discouragingly to Roher’s question about parenthood. “I know people who work on AI risk who don’t expect their child to make it to high school,” says Harris, in a line that drew gasps from a preview audience in Park City.\n\nOn the other side are optimistic figures such as Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPRIZE Foundation trying to extend human life, who claims that “children born today are about to enter a period of glorious transformation”; Guillaume Verdon, a leader of the “effective accelerationism” movement in Silicon Valley; Peter Lee, the president of Microsoft Research; and Daniela Amodei, the co-founder and president of OpenAI rival Anthropic. So-called “accelerationists” see AI as a potential cure to a myriad of seemingly intractable issues afflicting humanity: cancer, food and water shortages for an ever-growing population, insufficient renewable energy and perhaps most pressing, climate emergency. Without AI, they argue, countless future lives would be lost to drought, famine, disease and natural catastrophes.\n\nDevelopment of AI, however, relies on computing power, which requires vast amounts of energy. A final group of interviewees, critics and observers largely outside the tech world – including Karen Hao, a journalist and author of the book Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI, and Liv Boeree, Win-Win podcast hos – connect AI to the tangible, physical world, such as the data centers sucking up water in the American west, leaving residents with sky-high electricity bills and drained reservoirs. The current narratives around AI, according to Emily M Bender, a computational linguistics professor, exclude and dehumanize the people it is already impacting, and will continue to disrupt.\n\nRoher eventually arrives at the five most powerful people – all men – currently leading the AI arms race: Altman; Elon Musk, the xAI CEO; Dario Amodei, the Anthropic CEO; Demis Hassabis of DeepMind and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg. Altman, Amodei and Hassabis sit for interviews that more or less defend their companies’ respective positions. According to the film, Zuckerberg declined to participate; Musk agreed but then got too busy.\n\nAltman, who at the time of the interview was expecting his first child, insists that he’s “not scared for a kid to grow up in a world with AI”. He and his husband Oliver Mulherin welcomed their son via a surrogate in February 2025, an event Altman later said “neurochemically hacked” his brain, leading people in his life to think that he would “make better decisions” for OpenAI and ChatGPT when it comes to “humanity as a whole”. The 40-year-old CEO went on to say that both his and Roher’s child would likely “never be smarter than AI” which “does unsettle me a little bit, but it is reality”.\n\nAt one point, Roher asks Altman if it is indeed impossible to reassure him that everything in regards to AI is going to be OK. “That is impossible,” Altman affirms, though he does say that OpenAI’s lead in the AI arms race allows it to spend more time on safety testing.\n\nThe AI Doc ultimately lands somewhere in between doomerism and optimism – apocaloptimism, as they call it, searching for “a path between the promise and the peril”. That path should include, according to numerous film subjects: significant, sustained, paradigm-shifting international coordination, akin the mid-century frameworks and agreements introduced to moderate the development of atomic weapons – more corporate transparency for AI companies, an independent regulatory body to police AI developers, legal liability for the companies’ products, such as ChatGPT, mandatory disclosure of genAI use for media and a willingness to keep adapting the rules for rapidly shifting tech.\n\nWhether or not the US government and companies, let alone the world, can do it remains an open question, with differing opinions on first steps. But if there is one thing the many subjects all agree on, it’s that there’s no going back to a time before AI. As Anthropic co-founder and CEO Amodei puts it: “This train isn’t going to stop.”\n\nThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released on 27 March",

    "fullText": "Popularity of EVs in country is part of global trend of emerging markets spurning fossil fuel cars at surprising speeds\n\nWhen Berke Astarcıoğlu bought a BMW i3 in 2016, he was one of just 44 people in a country of 80 million to buy a battery electric vehicle (BEV) that year. By the time he bought a Tesla in 2023, BEVs were no longer a complete oddity in Turkey, making up 7% of new car sales.\n\nFast-forward two years and electric cars are selling so fast that Turkey has caught up with the EU in its rate of adoption. Its market is now the fourth largest in Europe, behind Germany, the UK and France.\n\n“A premium product is a thing that makes you happy but that not everyone can have,” said Astarcıoğlu, a mechatronic engineer from Istanbul and the developer of an app to find charging stations. “My Tesla has become an ordinary car over here.”\n\nBEVs made up 16.7% of new car sales in Turkey in 2025, just behind the EU’s 17.4%, registration data published on Tuesday shows. While uptake is lower than in the Netherlands or the Nordics, where BEVs make up 35% to 96% of new cars sold, sales in Turkey have raced ahead of almost every country in southern and eastern Europe.\n\nIts electric vehicle surge is part of a global trend in which emerging markets from Uruguay to Vietnam are spurning fossil fuel-burning cars at surprising speed. The latest data comes as Turkey prepares to host the UN climate summit, and one month after the EU watered down its 2035 ban on new combustion engine cars.\n\nAnalysts attribute the boom to a disparity in Turkey’s special consumption tax, which has left electric cars only slightly more expensive than comparable petrol cars. Sales remained high even after the government raised taxes on electric vehicles in August.\n\n“Practically speaking, Turkish people don’t buy electric vehicles because it’s eco-friendly,” said Ufuk Alparslan, an analyst at the climate thinktank Ember, saying that running costs were lower for electric cars. “The motivation is purely economical.”\n\nElectrifying car fleets is seen as a crucial step to decarbonising the transport sector and reducing pollution, but efforts in many regions have run into roadblocks. In the EU, where planet-heating emissions from cars have risen by 17% since 1990, attempts to phase out combustion engines have been met with fierce resistance from the automobile industry.\n\nThe Turkish government does not have a dedicated electric vehicle strategy but has championed a domestic carmaker, Togg, which in 2024 overtook Tesla as the country’s leading EV seller. In an interview with Bloomberg HT last week, Togg’s board chair, Fuat Tosyalı, announced plans to increase production from 40,000 cars in 2025 to 60,000 in 2026.\n\nTogg’s entry into the market, which was buoyed up by tax support and zero-interest credit from state-owned banks, has helped normalise electric vehicle adoption, said Berkan Bayram, the founder of the Turkish Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association. “It gained the heart of Turkish buyers.”\n\nForeign carmakers who must contend with import duties have benefited from the Togg-friendly tax system, with manufacturers including Tesla reducing motor power in Turkey to fall into the same favourable tax bracket. China’s BYD is also jostling for a greater share of the market and plans to build a $1bn factory in Turkey.\n\nIn addition to the environmental benefits of displacing fossil fuel vehicles, the transition to electric mobility could be a geopolitical boon for countries that do not produce oil themselves. Turkey’s car fleet is expected to quadruple in size by 2053, sending demand for oil imports soaring, according to a report by InstitutDE, a Turkish diplomatic thinktank in Brussels.\n\nWhile imports will rise in all scenarios studied, a failure to run more cars on electricity would heighten Turkey’s exposure to external shocks, price volatility and geopolitical risks, the report found.\n\nHowever, the recent increase in BEV sales may not herald a systemic shift away from fossil fuel cars. The tax incentives are “very fragile” and can change easily, said Baki Kaya, an economist and former diplomat who co-wrote the InstitutDE report.\n\n“It’s not the result of a strategic decision,” he said. “And I’m personally not that optimistic [it will continue].”\n\nAnalysis from Ember found the overall tax burden on electric cars remained high, with the total tax applied to electric cars in the lowest bracket reaching 50%, and rising to 86% in a higher bracket. Without changes, inflation and exchange rates could soon shrink the number of affordable BEVs, Alparslan said.\n\n“Although electric cars have started to become widespread in Turkey, there is still a large, untapped potential to reduce energy imports through renewable energy and electric vehicles,” he said. “Tax policies that keep electric vehicle prices at more affordable levels could accelerate this momentum.”",

    "fullText": "Jan 28 (Reuters) - China has approved its first batch of Nvidia's H200 artificial intelligence chips for import, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, marking a shift in position as China ​seeks to balance its AI needs against spurring domestic development.\n\nThe approval covers several hundred thousand H200 chips ‌and was granted during Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang's visit to China this week, the sources said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity ‌of the matter.\n\nThe first batch of approvals has been allocated primarily to three major Chinese internet companies, with other enterprises now joining a queue for subsequent approvals, one of the sources said.\n\nThey declined to name the companies that received the initial clearances.\n\nChina's industry and commerce ministries as well as Nvidia had not yet responded to requests for comment at the time ⁠of publication.\n\nThe H200, Nvidia's second most ‌powerful AI chip, has emerged as a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations.

However, Chinese authorities have the final say on whether they would allow it to be ​shipped in.\n\nIt was unclear in recent weeks whether Beijing would grant approval as the government wants to balance ‌meeting surging domestic demand for advanced AI chips and nurturing its domestic semiconductor industry.\n\nChinese customs authorities told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month.\n\nBut Chinese technology firms have placed orders for more than two million H200 chips, far exceeding Nvidia's available inventory, Reuters reported last month.\n\nIt remains uncertain how many additional companies will receive approval in subsequent batches or what criteria Beijing is using to determine eligibility.\n\nHuang arrived ⁠in Shanghai last Friday for routine annual celebrations with Nvidia's China ​employees and has since travelled to Beijing and other cities, Reuters ​reported last week.\n\nThe approvals of H200 suggest Beijing is prioritising the needs of major Chinese internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centres needed to develop AI ‍services and compete with U.S. ⁠rivals, including OpenAI.\n\nWhile Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the performance of Nvidia's H20 chip, previously the most advanced AI chip it was allowed to sell to China, they still ⁠lag far behind the H200.",

    "description": "Recent research reveals retirees withdraw just 2.1% of their savings annually—about half the amount experts recommend. Here's what the data shows.",
    "fullText": "Recent research shows that married retirees withdraw about 2.1% of their savings annually, while spending 80% of their guaranteed income, like Social Security.\n\nMorningstar's latest analysis suggests retirees can safely withdraw 3.9% to start, close to the classic 4% annual withdrawal rule\n\nThose willing to adjust spending based on market conditions could take out up to almost 6%.\n\nDecember 2025 research from Morningstar raised its recommended safe withdrawal rate to 3.9%,up from 3.7% the prior year. But actual retiree behavior tells a different story.\n\nWhy do most retirees withdraw less than recommended?\n\nWhat withdrawal rate do experts currently recommend for retirees?\n\nHow does guaranteed income affect retirement withdrawal behavior?\n\nWhat's the difference between flexible and fixed withdrawal strategies?\n\nThe Morningstar figure comes close to the 4% rule, which is one of the best-known in personal finance: it's the percentage of your retirement savings you should withdraw in your first year. Every year afterward, you adjust the percentage for inflation, and, if you have enough saved, your money should last for your retirement. But recent research shows many retirees aren't even close to this traditional guideline.\n\nA 2025 study in Financial Planning Review by David Blanchett and Michael Finke found that married 65-year-olds with at least $100,000 in assets withdraw just 2.1% per year from their retirement accounts. Single retirees take out even less, about 1.9%. Meanwhile, retirees spend about 80% of their guaranteed income, like Social Security, but only ever expend about half of their retirement savings.\n\nThe result is that while most people fear they won't have enough to retire on, many retirees are living more frugally than they might need to, potentially missing out on experiences they spent a lifetime saving for. But for others, a lower withdrawal rate isn't unfounded—it's prudent based on the math of trying to float a retirement with less.\n\nWe take you through what you need to know below.\n\nReviewing the accounts of 70,000 retirees age 60 and over, Vanguard's findings reveal just how cautious—and inconsistent—many retirees are in taking withdrawals:\n\nOnly about a third withdrew money during each of the years Vanguard reviewed, and just 20% of that group maintained a steady withdrawal rate considered to be between 3% and 10% annually.\n\nThe median retiree in Vanguard's sample had a 401(k) balance of $133,000 at retirement, about 2.2 years' worth of income. It's no surprise that those who cashed out entirely tended to have smaller balances and lower income before they retired.\n\nThat $133,000 median balance is a critical detail. At the traditional 4% withdrawal rate, that provides about $5,300 a year—helpful for paying bills, but not nearly enough to fund a retirement. For retirees with more modest retirement savings, cautious spending isn't a psychological quirk but a prudent approach to having fewer resources.",

    "fullText": "An incident that underscores both the promise and the growing pains of EV (electric vehicle) ownership just played out on camera. A Tesla driver’s routine stop at a public charging station turned into a frustrating episode, and the moment was immortalized on vehicle security cameras.\n\nThe story, first shared by the owner on the Reddit forum r/TeslaModelY, quickly spread through EV and automotive circles, lighting debates over charging-station security, equipment vulnerability, and even the readiness of public infrastructure for mass EV adoption.\n\nWe recently reported an emerging trend of EV charger thefts, targeted for their copper, and costing charging stations hundreds of thousands of dollars in replacement costs.\n\nIn this story, the owner reported plugging in at a public charger and stepping away for roughly 30 minutes — only to return and find that a critical charging accessory had been stolen. The item taken was a J1772 adapter, an essential piece of hardware that allows Tesla drivers to connect to non-Tesla charging stations.\n\nBeyond the theft itself, what made this more than just a petty theft story was how the incident was captured. The Tesla’s built-in surveillance, a combination of Sentry Mode and external cameras designed to protect the vehicle, recorded the interaction.\n\nAnd that’s how the owner and others in the EV community could see exactly what happened. The video showed a woman approaching the car and removing the adapter — an act that, until now, many drivers assumed would be deterred by Tesla’s lock-in features that secure charging ports.\n\nIn follow-up comments, the Tesla owner explained that they were unaware the locking feature had not been enabled. Unfortunately, that small oversight came with significant consequence. After sharing the footage, the owner managed to locate and recover the adapter, and plans to enable the lock feature on future visits.\n\nNot merely a quirky footnote in the life of a Tesla owner, this story reflects broader stresses in the rapidly evolving EV ecosystem.\n\nA sustained EV proliferation will sustain increasing demand for public charging infrastructure. Early adopters often praise the environmental benefits and futuristic tech of EVs, but incidents like this, however seemingly inconsequential, can further undermine confidence in the reliability and security of the charging network. This is especially the case with cautious EV converts still on the fence.\n\nCharging stations, especially those maintained by third-party providers or local councils, are typically unmanned and scattered across public spaces such as shopping centers, highway rest stops, and municipal lots. Unlike a fuel pump at a gas station — where attendants, lighting, and surveillance have evolved over decades — EV chargers are still figuring out the human and security infrastructure needed to go with the hardware.\n\nThis gap has proven to make them ripe targets for theft, vandalism, and misuse. It used to be that the main complaint was about EV owners who treat charging stations as car-sitters; now people have to worry about their chargers being targets for thieves.\n\nTeslas are famous for their advanced camera systems and a mode called Sentry Mode, which uses the car’s exterior cameras to monitor and record suspicious activity around the car when left unattended.\n\nOriginally designed to combat vandalism and break-ins, Sentry Mode has, over the years, captured everything from graffiti attacks to attempted thefts. It has proven a powerful tool for owners and, in some cases, law enforcement.\n\nYet this very bounty of data raises questions deeper than whether thieves might target an adapter. As more incidents are recorded and shared online, concerns about privacy, data usage, and surveillance are surfacing in tandem.\n\nCameras ‘catch’ a thief snatching a charger, and people suddenly remember that Tesla and other automakers amass enormous amounts of footage and sensor data that, while invaluable in cases of vandalism or accident reconstruction, could also be mishandled or misused.\n\nAn insurer says they’re cutting prices in half for cars running FSD (Tesla’s full self-driving technology), and we’re wondering what that means for driving data being shared with an insurance provider. That tension has already drawn scrutiny and criticism from privacy advocates.\n\nGirl stole my J1772 adapter\nbyu/uglah inTeslaModelY\n\nThere are several key takeaways for the average Tesla or EV owner:\n\nEnable all available security features — including charging port locks and Sentry Mode — to deter theft and protect equipment.\n\nBe aware of the surrounding environment when using public chargers; well-lit, high-traffic areas will always be safer.\n\nRecord and share incidents responsibly — community vigilance helps highlight weaknesses in public infrastructure and encourages operators to step up security.\n\nThis episode offers a snapshot of an industry in transition. A growing EV adoption will expose gaps in charging security, public awareness, and infrastructure readiness. It’s normal, and stories like this, amplified by social media and the built-in cameras of the vehicles themselves, help reveal how advanced driver-owned tech has become and how imperfect the human and civic systems around it still are.",

    "description": "\"Give the animals space and respect.\"",
    "fullText": "A resurfaced incident from June 2022 about a Yellowstone National Park bison attack is drawing attention online, as viewers react to yet another reminder of how quickly wildlife encounters can turn dangerous when people get too close.\n\nABC News reported the occurrence at the time, detailing how a bull bison gored a 71-year-old woman while she visited the park — the third bison attack at Yellowstone that year.\n\nAccording to park officials, the woman and her daughter were heading back to their vehicle at Storm Point near Yellowstone Lake when they inadvertently approached the animal, causing it to charge. The woman suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a nearby hospital in Cody, Wyoming.\n\nThe story continues to circulate online as an example of how easily visitors can misjudge wild animals' behavior, especially during peak seasons.\n\nYellowstone urges visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from bison and other large animals. Despite appearing calm, bison are unpredictable and can run up to three times faster than humans.\n\n\"Mother bison are extremely protective of their calves in spring, and bulls can be more aggressive in July and August,\" Dennis Jorgensen, a bison program manager at the World Wildlife Fund, told ABC News.\n\nSimilar incidents have continued in the years since, with Yellowstone reporting additional bison-related injuries in 2024 and 2025, which are often tied to visitors approaching animals too closely for photos or videos.\n\nBeyond the danger to people, these encounters can also endanger wildlife. Animals that injure humans — even when provoked — may be euthanized, removing healthy animals from protected ecosystems because of human behavior.\n\nCommenters responding to ABC News' coverage on Facebook emphasized that the responsibility lies with visitors, not wildlife.\n\n\"I don't understand why such simple rules are broken these are wild animals and you are driving in their home,\" one person said.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAnother commenter wrote: \"The Rules are for Humans to follow. These animals are doing what's natural, instinct, it's their home and people should respect these awesome creatures.\"\n\n\"This is their habitat.

The move restricts silver exports, requiring licenses that have become harder to get. Only 44 companies qualified for silver export licenses as China seeks to guarantee supply for next-gen solar, EVs, and electronics technologies.\n\nThe move accelerated a rally that emerged last year, driven by bullishness over industrial demand for high-tech applications and, more generally, by rising interest among investors eager to diversify portfolios by owning silver ETFs, such as the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), or physical silver, such as coins and bars.\n\nThe numbers are truly massive. Silver's move has lifted the market's size above $6 trillion. Putting that figure into perspective, Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet boast market caps of $4.5 trillion, $3.75 trillion, and $4 trillion, respectively.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nEveryone wants in on the action.\n\nOn January 26, the iShares Silver Trust exchange-traded fund saw turnover of nearly $40 billion, according to Bloomberg, a figure similar to that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the go-to ETF for the 500 most influential publicly traded companies. That's nearly 20x higher than it had been averaging for most of last year.\n\nMoves like this aren't common, and they're often warning shots to which investors ought to pay attention. I've been tracking markets for more than 30 years, and I've seen more than my fair share of jaw-dropping pops that eventually turned into drops.",

Four of the deceased were passengers, while the other two on board were flight crew. There were no survivors. (The FAA said in an initial notice that seven had died, with one survivor, who was seriously injured.)\n\nA news release shared by the airport on Monday, Jan. 26, read, \"According to the flight manifest there were six people on the flight. No one from the incident was transported to the hospital, and all on the flight are presumed to be deceased. The identities of the people on the flight are not being released publicly at this time, pending positive identification.\"\n\nJacob Hosmer was the captain of the flight, NBC affiliate KPRC reported. The Houston-area pilot, 47, was confirmed to have been among the victims of the crash by his father, Gary.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n“He’s in Heaven now with Jesus,” Gary told the outlet.\n\nA friend, who knew Hosmer for 15 years as an aviation specialist, said, \"I would describe him as a great pilot, a loving husband, and a phenomenal father,” adding, “He was always kind. He was always laughing.\"\n\nThe plane involved in the crash had arrived from Texas, according to Reuters. It is registered to a company with a Houston address shared with the personal injury law firm Arnold & Itkin.\n\nHosmer had Houston-based injury law firm Arnold & Itkin LLP listed as his employer on LinkedIn since May 2025.\n\nThe firm's founders, Kurt Arnold and Jason Itkin, were not on the aircraft, multiple sources told ABC affiliate KTRK.\n\nHowever, Kurt's wife, attorney Tara Arnold, was reportedly killed in the crash, sources told the outlet.\n\nHarris County Commissioner Lesley Briones, a close friend of the family, told the outlet, \"I'm close friends with Kurt and Tara Arnold, and we're still waiting for additional information. Unfortunately, the plane went down (Sunday) evening in Maine, and my heart hurts for them, for their children, and for their families.\"\n\nArnold & Itkin have not shared an official statement about the crash as of Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\n\"She was a phenomenal person, a bold leader, and someone with a heart of service,\" Briones continued of Tara, according to KTRK. \"She was very involved in Precinct 4 and our nonprofit, Precinct 4 Forward. My heart is with Kurt, their children, and everyone affected.\"\n\nEvent planner Shawna Collins was also on board the aircraft, according to her daughter, the outlet reported. Collins reportedly spoke to her daughter about the business trip just before the flight, which was heading to Europe.\n\nThe Bangor Police Department did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for confirmation of the victims' IDs on Tuesday, Jan. 27.\n\nIn an audio recording of air traffic controllers’ conversation following the crash, one person said, “Aircraft upside down. We have a passenger aircraft upside down.”\n\nFirst responders arrived at the scene less than a minute after the conversation about the upside-down aircraft, airport director Jose Saavedra said, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe plane caught fire after the crash, according to the FAA. The exact circumstances surrounding the crash remain unclear.\n\nThe airport was being impacted by Winter Storm Fern, with snow falling at the time of the crash, CBS affiliate KHOU and Reuters reported.",

    "fullText": "A move that resonates well beyond a simple change of office address sees Ford Motor Company confirmed that its Lincoln luxury brand will shift its corporate headquarters to Michigan Central Station in Detroit in February 2026.\n\nThe new location will house Lincoln’s marketing, sales, and service leadership teams, while design and engineering functions will remain at Ford’s primary Dearborn campus, now anchored by the new Ford World Headquarters.\n\nAt face value, this relocation might look like a real estate shuffle. But for industry watchers with an eye toward long term strategy, it represents a deliberate effort by Ford to reshape Lincoln’s identity and carve out a distinct role for the luxury marque in a crowded and rapidly evolving market.\n\nMichigan Central Station was once one of the most iconic transportation hubs in the United States. It opened in 1913 and served thousands of passengers a day until rail travel declined sharply in the mid-20th century.\n\nAfter lying abandoned for decades, Ford acquired and undertook an extensive renovation of the station and surrounding campus beginning in 2018, creating a 640,000-square-foot innovation district designed to attract tech partners and startups alongside Ford employees.\n\nThis context is important because Ford’s decision to base Lincoln at Michigan Central couldn’t have been simply a branding exercise. It places the luxury brand at the center of a testbed for future technologies, from autonomous systems to new mobility services.\n\nThe innovation district already hosts Ford’s Model e electric vehicle team and external partners like Newlab, creating a synergy that Lincoln’s leadership must hope will fuel fresh thinking.\n\nLincoln, Ford, Michigan Central Station, Detroit, headquarters, relocation, luxury brand, corporate strategy, innovation district, automotive news, Corktown, brand identity, Joaquin Nuño-Whelan.\n\nLincoln has historically been intertwined with Ford corporate operations. Until recently, the brand’s leaders shared office space with Ford’s global executives in Dearborn’s famed Glass House, a mid-century architectural landmark that served as Ford’s headquarters from 1956 until late 2025.\n\nThe new Ford World Headquarters, known internally as “The Hub,” has replaced the Glass House as Ford’s administrative center. It brings thousands of employees into closer collaboration on product development and corporate strategy. But Lincoln’s leadership must have seen an opportunity in stepping outside that central locus.",

Five had chosen to travel to the United States, while the others chose alternative travel arrangements to their home countries, ⁠Anwar said.\n\nLast week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had expected the U.S. to free the crew members, ‌which he said included two Russians, as well as Ukrainians, Georgians and Indians.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks made a two-for-one deal when they cut ties with Trae Young this season. CJ McCollum was the headliner of the package.\n\nSo far, the McCollum experience hasn’t gone great in the eyes of many Atlanta fans. With his shot selection frustrating spectators throughout his first few weeks of the team, McCollum has caught some heat on social media as of late.\n\nBut after a big night against the Indiana Pacers, he sent a message to his doubters.\n\nvia @CJMcCollum: Long season. Don’t fret. I really do this\n\nMcCollum’s message came right after he went 9-15 from the field and 5-7 from three, scoring 23 points in 28 minutes of action. He nearly locked up a triple-double after dishing out seven assists and coming down with eight rebounds.\n\nThe Hawks collected a comfortable victory over Indiana, winning 132-116.\n\nIn the seven games leading up to Monday’s action between the Hawks and the Pacers, McCollum averages 17.3 points per game, while shooting 43 percent from the field. Following his run with the Washington Wizards, McCollum has been struggling from three, going from hitting on 39 percent of his shots to just 26 percent with Atlanta.\n\nClearly, McCollum isn’t bothered by it. He was having a strong season with the rebuilding Wizards before the trade and seems to be confident in his ability to get settled and begin having a major impact for the Hawks, who are playoff-hopefuls this year.\n\nAfter a win over the Pacers, the Hawks are 23-25 on the year. They are in the midst of a three-game winning streak, collecting six wins over their last 10 games. Atlanta has a three-game lead over the Milwaukee Bucks for the tenth seed. They trail the ninth-seeded Bulls by just one game.\n\nThe Hawks will be back on the court on Wednesday night for a battle against the Boston Celtics.\n\nDonovan Mitchell does not want the Cavs to get ahead of themselves amid winning streak\n\nKnicks linked to 2-time NBA champion guard, ex-Celtics star in bombshell trade report\n\nLakers, Sixers among suitors for Keon Ellis",

    "fullText": "Just when you thought the Arizona Cardinals' search for a new head coach couldn't get any more interesting, a bomb dropped Tuesday afternoon. A new name emerged as a candidate the Cardinals brought in, and it is a name out of left field.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Dianna Russini, the Cardinals managed to bring is former Carolina Panthers and Washington Commanders head coach Ron Rivera for an in-person interview for the head coaching job without it being known immediately.\n\nRivera is the general manager of Cal Football in college. He was fired from his job with the Commanders after a 4-13 2023 season.\n\nIn his career, he is 102-103-2. He went 76-63-1 with the Panthers and made the playoffs four times, once making it to the Super Bowl. He went 26-40-1 with one postseason appearance with Washington. In his time as a head coach from 2011-2023, he never had consecutive winning seasons. Two of his playoff appearances came with losing records.\n\nIs he a serious candidate to replace Jonathan Gannon? That's what we don't know. We do not know when the interview happened. It might have been early on in the process.\n\nBut with a name like that in the ether, it is something to watch, as it appears that the Cardinals are not done with their search.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick will likely be enshrined in the NFL Hall of Fame, but it won't happen in 2026.\n\nIn a shocking decision, Belichick did not receive the 80% of votes necessary for enshrinement in his first year on the ballot.\n\nDespite Belichick's eight Super Bowl rings, six as a head coach, he did not reach 40 of the 50 votes required. One of the main reasons, as outlined by Seth Wickersham, was due to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that took place during Belichick's tenure. According to an anonymous source of Wickersham's, some \"believed Belichick should 'wait a year' before induction as penance for Spygate.\"\n\nThe decision not to elect Belichick in his first year of eligibility was not well received. Despite the coach's past scandals and the current unsuccessful transition to college coaching, he is still widely accepted as deserving of the Hall of Fame and should have been elected in his first year.\n\nHere is more on the NFL world's reaction to Belichick not being a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nMORE: Why is Bill Belichick not a first ballot Hall of Famer?\n\nThe former star defender weighed in on Belichick not being elected to Canton in his first year on the ballot. Watt never played for Belichick, always against him, but that didn't stop him from respecting an NFL legend. Watt himself will be first eligible for a call to the hall in 2028.\n\nI can’t be reading this right.\n\nThis has to be some knock-off Hall of Fame or something, it can’t be the actual NFL Hall of Fame.\n\nThere is not a single world whatsoever in which Bill Belichick should not be a First-Ballot Hall of Famer. https://t.co/OXhL1Sd4FM\n\n— JJ Watt (@JJWatt) January 27, 2026\n\nButler spent nine years in the NFL. He began his career playing for Belichick in New England for two years. He then spent the 2011 season with the Carolina Panthers before ending his career with a six-year stint with the Indianapolis Colts.

He spent the majority of his career (2006 to 2013) with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Clark played against Belichick several times, but there is no doubt in his mind that Belichick is deserving of enshrinement.\n\nBill Belichick not being a first ballot Hall of Famer means that no coach should ever be. It means that the voters have decided there isn’t a coaching resume that warrants First Ballot consideration!\n\nHe is the GREATEST, most ACCOMPLISHED coach of all time!

    "fullText": "Six-time Super Bowl champion head coach Bill Belichick didn't get voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, according to a report from ESPN.\n\nCiting four unidentified sources, ESPN reported Tuesday that Belichick didn't receive the necessary 40 votes from the 50-person panel of media members and other Hall of Famers. ESPN said Belichick received a call from the Hall of Fame last Friday with the news.\n\nThe Hall of Fame declined to comment before its class of 2026 is announced at NFL Honors in San Francisco on Feb. 5.\n\nThe report of Belichick's snub was met with significant criticism, including from Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who posted on social media: “Insane … don’t even understand how this could be possible.”\n\nBelichick was hired by New England in 2000 and led the franchise to six Super Bowl wins and three other appearances in the title game during an 18-year span from 2001-18. Belichick’s 333 wins in the regular season and playoffs with New England and Cleveland are the second most to Don Shula’s 347. He won AP NFL Coach of the Year three times.\n\nBelichick also was one of the game’s top defensive assistants before taking over in New England, winning two earlier Super Bowls as defensive coordinator for the New York Giants.\n\nBelichick’s career did have blemishes. He was implicated in a sign-stealing scandal dubbed “Spygate” in the 2007 season and was fined $500,000 after the team was caught filming defensive signals from the New York Jets during a game.\n\nBelichick’s tenure in New England ended following the 2023 season. He just finished his first year coaching in college at North Carolina.\n\nBelichick was one of five finalists among coaches, contributors and senior players who last appeared in a game in 2000 or earlier. Patriots owner Robert Kraft was the contributor finalist, with Roger Craig, Ken Anderson and L.C. Greenwood the players.\n\nBetween one and three of those finalists will be inducted into the Hall along with between three and five modern-era players from a group of 15 finalists.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Entering a particularly consequential season for coach Lincoln Riley at USC, a brutal Big Ten slate won’t cut the Trojans or their coach any slack in 2026.\n\nThat much was clear long before the Big Ten officially released its schedule for next season Tuesday. USC already knew it would face the conference’s top three teams from a season ago (Indiana, Ohio State and Oregon). But the official unveiling of the slate would further solidify just how grueling the climb could be for USC next season.\n\nOregon will face Portland State, an FCS team, a week before coming to USC on Sept. 26. Ohio State will have a bye week before its Halloween meeting with USC at the Coliseum, and so will the defending champ, Indiana, which USC will face in Bloomington on Nov. 14.\n\nThe Trojans will assuredly have to win at least one of those games to maintain their hopes of making the College Football Playoff in Riley’s fifth season. The rest of the schedule is hardly a cakewalk too, with trips to Rutgers (Sept. 19), Penn State (Oct. 10) and Wisconsin (Oct. 24).\n\nThe nonconference schedule is still being finalized, after talks broke down between USC and Notre Dame over the future of their rivalry series. But with two byes already baked into the Trojans’ schedule, a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly told The Times that USC plans to schedule its season opener during Week Zero, with a home game on Aug. 29.\n\nThat timing drastically cuts down USC’s options for finding a fill-in opponent to open the season against at the Coliseum.\n\nIn order to play in Week Zero in its home stadium and not internationally or at a neutral site, USC must secure an exemption from the NCAA. That probably limits the Trojans to a team that faces Hawaii in 2026 — and thus gets an exemption from the NCAA to play an additional game — or means playing a Football Championship Series team, which USC has notably never done.\n\nStarting the season early will allow for USC to add an extra bye week, while most Big Ten schools are working with just one during their 2026 slates. It’ll need that break considering what the latter half of the season holds.\n\nAfter kicking off in late August, USC opens the season with home games in five of its first six weeks. But after that, the Trojans return home just twice the rest of the season, for matchups against Ohio State on Oct. 31 and Maryland on Nov. 21.\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Friars still undecided who will be the starting first baseman this season.",
    "fullText": "It is hard to imagine that San Diego Padres second baseman Jake Cronenworth is entering his seventh season with the franchise. A feat that should not be dismissed, as his versatility to play multiple infield positions could be key to the Padres’ success in 2026.\n\nToo often, we value hitting metrics more than fielding stats in determining a player’s importance to a team’s success. Cronenworth’s bottom-of-the-order run production, paired with his outstanding glove work, earned him a full-time starting role with the Padres since arriving in 2020.\n\nHe came to San Diego in the Hunter Renfroe trade with the Tampa Bay Rays. The Padres highly valued his versatility, as he could effectively play first base, second base and shortstop.\n\nThe intangible is his career fielding percentage (.991), as Cronenworth’s attention to detail allows him to take a challenge and usually excel in a position change. His defense does not suffer because he has maintained a utility player’s mentality, despite being the starting second baseman.\n\nCronenworth is exceptional at fielding balls hit directly at him. Other middle infielders may have more range, but it is not a guarantee that they will field each ball hit in their direction.\n\nObviously, the front office prefers to keep Cronenworth at second base, but circumstances may force him to play more at first base this season. The Friars are hoping to add another bat before opening Spring Training in Peoria, Ariz. on Feb. 11.\n\nAt the plate, Cronenworth’s value is his ability to move runners along the base paths and drive in those who are in scoring position. His standout season came in 2021, Cronenworth hit .266 (career best) with 21 HR (61 extra-base hits) and 71 RBI. He achieved a career-high 122 OPS+, which earned him his first All-Star Game appearance.\n\nLast season, Cronenworth struggled with consistency at the plate after missing time with fractured ribs. The injury limited him to a .246 batting average with 11 HR and 59 RBI in 135 games. The concern was his lack of power from the left side of the plate, as just 32 of his 103 hits were for extra-base hits.\n\nThe Padres hope Cronenworth returns to his former power-hitting, run-producing self, as this would add considerable length to the batting order.\n\nSpring Training should have the same feel for Cronenworth, as he will take fielding reps at first and second base. However, he has no clue where he will start in the regular season. Some time at first base could be in his future, especially with the uncertainty of free agent Luis Arraez possibly returning to the fold.\n\nThankfully, Cronenworth is the type of player who comes to the ballpark ready to compete. It does not matter where he plays as long as his name is in the lineup.\n\nTo get back to the postseason, the Friars must excel at using Cronenworth’s versatility to their advantage.",

That wasn't the only change to coach Sean Payton's staff.\n\nA few hours after the Lombardi news broke, Denver confirmed that firing and announced the additional departures of wide receivers coach Keary Colbert and cornerbacks coach Addison Lynch. The Broncos now have three open positions to fill this offseason (and that number could grow if they lose any coaches to other clubs).\n\n\"I want to thank these coaches for playing an important role in elevating our program over the last three seasons,\" Payton said in a statement. \"I've been fortunate to work with Joe Lombardi for 15 years and am particularly grateful for his many contributions to our success as offensive coordinator.\n\n\"We sincerely appreciate Joe, Keary and Addison's hard work and wish them all the best in the future.\"\n\nDavis Webb could be a strong in-house candidate to replace Lombardi if he does not head a head coach job elsewhere.

They likely need to win at least five more games to stay off the bubble.

    "description": "FC Bayern will get tested vs. PSV Eindhoven.",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich coach Vincent Kompany can see that his team is a little tired and banged up, but that does not mean he is planning to rest his most important players — especially because Kompany views PSV Eindhoven as bigtime competition.\n\n“Winning 6-2 against Napoli and 4-1 against Liverpool – those are unique results. You can see that the team believes in itself. They are strong going forward, very quick on the counter-attack. They also have players who score goals. They lost 1-3 against Saint-Gilloise, but we’re Bayern, we’re \n\n“I would compare PSV and Bayern, there are many similarities: how we attack, the roles of the strikers, the number 10s, the full-backs, the midfield, the build-up play… PSV play high pressing and are fully oriented towards the opponents, which makes the team very compact.\n\n“We’re in the position of having almost our entire squad available. Only a few still need to integrate after their return. We know PSV’s qualities. We have confidence in our squad. We believe in those who will start tomorrow.”\n\nAs always, Kompany is keeping his personnel plans close to the vest, but did comment on a few players.\n\n“When we have so many games, I don’t decide who plays the day before. I’ll think about it tomorrow after I get up. I have 100% respect for PSV; I know it will be difficult. It’s not just about (potentially resting) Harry (Kane). The quality of the pressing also depends on energy – that was our problem against Augsburg. I have to consider whether it’s a question of quality or also one of energy – I’ll decide that tomorrow. I want to win, there’s no doubt about that,” said Kompany. “Sacha (Boey) hasn’t trained that much yet, but he’s finally recovered from this illness. He showed good signs in training today, he can help us for a few minutes. He won’t start yet, but it’s fortunate that he’s fit again. This comes at the right time for us.\n\n“We all agree that (Jamal Musiala and Alphonso Davies) are two good players. Unfortunately, there’s no ‘soft integration’ at this stage of the season; it’s a hard integration. Playing time is based on performance, that’s our piece of the puzzle. We’re close to having a complete squad at the most important time of the season. The important thing is that we have all our best players in February and March. Stani (Josip Stanišić) and (Konrad) Laimer will also be back by then.”\n\nAs for Wednesday, it sure seems like Kompany is planning on using his top, available players to ward off a hungry PSV Eindhoven squad.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Denver Broncos offensive pass game coordinator and quarterbacks coach Davis Webb is quickly becoming one of the hottest names on the coaching market. Webb has interviewed for head coaching vacancies with the Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, and Arizona Cardinals. However, if he doesn't land one of those jobs, a promotion in Denver could be on the table.\n\nAs of 5 p.m., NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported that the Broncos have fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi, creating an immediate opening on the staff. With Webb already playing a key role in the offense and earning league-wide interest, he would appear to be a strong internal candidate to step into the offensive coordinator role.\n\nThe #Broncos fired OC Joe Lombardi, per me and @TomPelissero.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 27, 2026\n\nAny final decisions will have to be made once all head coaching positions are filled. It's safe to say that Webb will be in good hands this upcoming season, either as a head coach or the next offensive coordinator for the Broncos. He will then be better suited and one of the favorites to land a head coaching job next season if nothing comes of the Raiders, Browns, or Cardinals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ravens Wire: The Broncos could promote Davis Webb after Joe Lombardi's firing",

    "description": "The Golden Eagles return to Milwaukee for an I-94 rivalry game after a pair of extremely shaky road wins.",
    "fullText": "Full faith and credit to Marquette to locking down Butler in the closing moments last time out. Sure, letting a 19-0 second quarter run go to waste as they frittered away a 14 point lead at the start of the fourth quarter down to getting lucky after committing a five second violation and Lee Volker hitting a free throw with 16 seconds left to dodge a problem isn’t a fun way to go through life.\n\nBut Marquette was also going through that particular moment in life without Jada Bediako or Skylar Forbes available. It’s unclear as to what’s up with Bediako, although it was the second straight game that she was out and also not on the bench. In Forbes’ case, she didn’t travel with the team to Indianapolis for what was called “personal reasons” on the ESPN+ broadcast. On one hand, it wasn’t the best possible Marquette roster that head coach Cara Consuegra could have put on the floor for 40 minutes…. on the other hand, did I mention that 19-0 run and the 14 point lead? And that game came just days after Marquette gutted out a road win over St. John’s in the wake of giving up massive runs to Seton Hall and Georgetown in a pair of losses. So, y’know: Yay for getting the W…. but I’ve got questions, and so should you.\n\nWe’ll see exactly what’s up with Marquette and Bediako and Forbes when the availability report comes out on Wednesday afternoon. If they’re out again, it’s probably about time for Consuegra to start explaining exactly what’s going on. If they’re back in the lineup, then it’s all systems go and time for the Golden Eagles to stack up a third straight win heading into this weekend’s rematch with Georgetown.\n\nDate: Wednesday, January 28, 2026\nTime: 6:30pm Central\nLocation: Al McGuire Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\nStreaming: ESPN+, with Bob Brainerd and Chloe Marotta calling the action\nLive Stats: Stat Broadcast\nBluesky Updates: @AnonymousEagle\n\nMarquette is 40-49 all time against DePaul. The Blue Demons have controlled the series 23-22 since the two teams have joined the Big East, but the Golden Eagles have won 10 of the last 11 and each of the last eight in a row after an 85-54 victory in Chicago back in December.\n\nI don’t think there’s anything particularly interesting to take away from Marquette’s first game against DePaul this season in terms of “how do the Golden Eagles approach a second meeting?” MU was up 7-0 and 18-5 during the first quarter before wrapping up the first 10 minutes up 23-9. The Golden Eagles won each of the remaining quarters by three, nine, and five points on their way to a 31 point victory and no one played more than 27 minutes. I guess the interesting statistical item is that Marquette wasn’t really knocking anyone’s socks off with 50.9% shooting overall and 38.9% from behind the three-point line. This wasn’t a game where Marquette couldn’t miss, it was more a game where DePaul couldn’t do anything but miss, so perhaps MU’s defensive effort against the Blue Demons is the interesting component there.\n\nIt will be a slightly different DePaul team this time around against Marquette. Aizhanique Mayo and Shakara McCline missed the first meeting, and they’ve been getting regular minutes for the Blue Demons as the squad has beaten Georgetown and Creighton in their last five games and at least made Seton Hall make sure they stayed down in an 86-77 loss. Not a lot, mind you, just enough to deepen DePaul’s rotation a little bit and lessen a little bit of the pressure on Katie Novik, the team’s leader in points, rebounds, and assists, and the only Blue Demon averaging in double digits at 12.1 points per game.\n\nThe biggest question for this game is whether or not Marquette comes ready to go. DePaul has the worst defense in the Big East in league action, both in terms of points per possession efficiency and shooting percentages. A locked in Marquette squad should be able to get quality shots and rip the Blue Demons’ defense apart. A not-quite-locked-in Marquette, one that let Butler wander back in from down 15 late in the third quarter and needed to make a free throw to avoid giving BU a shot to tie at the horn? That kind of Marquette is at risk of getting run over like Creighton did in DePaul’s 76-61 win last time out.\n\nFollow Anonymous Eagle on social media\n\nFacebook: AnonymousEagle\n Instagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle",

    "fullText": "Now nearly a full month into 2026, college basketball teams are into the thick of their conference schedules. UNC, which secured a huge road upset of rival Virginia on Saturday, is in the top half of what's shaping up to be a deep ACC.\n\nNorth Carolina (16-4, 4-3 ACC) rolled through non-conference play with a 12-1 record, securing wins against fellow blue bloods Kansas and Kentucky. The Tar Heels hit an impasse to begin ACC play, losing their first three conference road games, but squeaked by Wake Forest at home and dominated Notre Dame.\n\nUNC has plenty more season ahead, with a third-straight NCAA Tournament appearance increasingly likely. In USA TODAY Sports' January 26 bracketology, released earlier Tuesday, North Carolina is a 5-seed in the East Region.\n\nUSAT projects the Tar Heels facing 12-seeded Belmont in Tampa, Fla. Joining UNC and the Bruins are 4-seed, reigning national champion Florida and 2023 Final Four squad Florida Atlantic.\n\nNorth Carolina and Belmont, the latter a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, previously played in November 2013. If you attended that game at the Dean Dome, you likely still have memories of a painful upset etched in your mind.\n\nAfter dropping consecutive games at Stanford and Cal on their West Coast swing, the Tar Heels are now winners of two straight. Derek Dixon is a key in the starting lineup, Caleb Wilson remains a superstar and head coach Hubert Davis is now playing his best rotations.\n\nUNC has all the pieces to make a National Championship run. Can North Carolina continue to play at its current pace, rise through the ACC and be college basketball's last team standing in April?\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC basketball projected the East's 5 seed in USAT Sports bracketology",

    "fullText": "Heading into the 2026 WWE Royal Rumble, multiple things are pointing to AJ Styles possibly losing to GUNTHER, then retiring from in-ring competition. The latest backing that outcome is a filing from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nFor weeks, the WWE Universe and WWE commentators have referred to GUNTHER as \"The Career Killer,\" given that he successfully put the careers of John Cena and WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg to rest in 2025. On Monday, filed to trademark \"Career Killer\" with the USPTO, potentially lending further credence to the scenario of GUNTHER defeating Styles at the Royal Rumble, where \"The Phenomenal One\" will put his career on the line.\n\nThis trademark application specifically aims to cover entertainment services related to professional wrestling, such as digital and broadcast media. As of this writing, the application is awaiting assignment to an examining attorney.\n\nSince GUNTHER bested Cena in his retirement match at the December 13 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Styles has demanded that \"The Career Killer\" show some respect to the legends that came before him in WWE, like Cena. Instead, GUNTHER has repeatedly shrugged off Styles' words and controversially beat him in a singles match on \"WWE Raw.\"\n\nAccording to fellow WWE star Shinsuke Nakamura, Styles previously disclosed to him that the 2026 Royal Rumble will indeed mark his retirement match. The social media post containing this information has since been deleted, suggesting that Nakamura may have accidently spoiled the result of GUNTHER vs. Styles.

    "fullText": "Did the Broncos just fire one coach to make sure they don't lose another? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos, two days after losing to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, have fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi. The move comes after the team posted a 14-3 season and nearly went to the Super Bowl.\n\nBut if you read between the lines, it seems that the Broncos might have a specific reason for making this decision and that involves another coach on their staff.\n\nQuarterbacks coach Davis Webb is suddenly a hot commodity around the league and is being considered for a head coaching job, despite being just 30 years old and never even being in a coordinator role. He interviewed with the Buffalo Bills, who hired Joe Brady as their new head coach on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Webb is being connected to the vacancy with the Las Vegas Raiders, something Sean Payton took a shot at on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, it seems that the Broncos are recognizing the interest in Webb, a former NFL player who is regarded by many in the league as a guaranteed future head coach, and could be making sure he doesn't go anywhere.\n\nIf Webb is a strong candidate for the Raiders job, it seems that the Broncos may have given him a choice between being a coordinator for a team that was one step away from the Super Bowl or taking over a team that hasn't won a playoff game in 23 years.\n\nMake no mistake, with Lombardi out, Webb is the clear frontrunner to become the new offensive coordinator for the Broncos. Should that happen, it brings another interesting question with it?\n\nWould Payton give up his play-calling duties?\n\nThat is something many Broncos fans have clamored for since Payton became the head coach, even with the team's success. Perhaps that would be one of Webb's bargaining chips. He could say that he'll turn down the Raiders job, if it's offered, if he is going to be allowed to be the Broncos' new play-caller in 2026.\n\nREAD:Broncos must do everything in their power to sign 27-TD free-agent running back\n\nThe firing of Lombardi, who has spent a total of 15 seasons working for Payton between the Broncos and New Orleans Saints, sets up some intriguing possibilities.\n\n6 honest takeaways from Broncos' devastating loss to Patriots in AFC Championship Game\n\nBroncos' Dre Greenlaw offers surprising insight following disappointing season\n\nBroncos will have huge decision to make at running back this offseason\n\nWhich Broncos players are set to become unrestricted free agents?\n\n4 Broncos players who may have just played their final game with team",

    "fullText": "(The Center Square) – The Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl run isn’t just a win for the team, but also a win for the Seattle economy, particularly for downtown bars, restaurants and hotels near Lumen Field.\n\nHowever, economic principles of fungibility suggest that the overall, long-term economic impact on the city may be exaggerated.\n\nThere is no doubt that the Seahawks' victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday – which advanced the team to Super Bowl LX against the New England Patriots on Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. – means a genuine, short-term economic boost to Seattle, especially the local hospitality industry.\n\nAccording to Visit Seattle, hosting National Football League playoff games – which the Seahawks did twice, being the top seed in the National Football Conference – provides a vital economic stimulus during the typically quiet winter season, with hotel occupancy often soaring more than 50% above typical January figures.\n\nThe Center Square reached out to several organizations about the Seahawks’ potential championship run and asked if a team making the Super Bowl brings localized, high-impact spending during the playoffs, noting the difference between a short-term economic boost and the more mixed long-term impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, I have absolutely no data to validate whether or not those claims may be true,” Patrick Connor, Washington state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, told The Center Square.\n\nJoey Thompson, public relations manager at Visit Seattle, had a similar take.\n\n“We won’t be able to provide any comment just yet, but we may be able to put together an estimated economic impact for hotels after the fact, when more data is available to us,” he said. “We’ll make sure to circle back!”\n\nDowntown Seattle Association President and CEO Jon Scholes said it will be a little while before any specific economic impact can be quantified.\n\n“The platform we use to measure economic impact of events has a lag time of 10-14 days, so we won’t have the NFC championship metrics for a while,” he explained.\n\nHe did point to a Tuesday morning Puget Sound Business Journal piece that includes a link to a 2025 U.S. Chamber of Commerce report with estimates of spending in the markets of last year’s Super Bowl participants, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n“For the hometowns of each team, the Chamber estimates the Kansas City metro area could see $123.3 million in spending on the big game, while the Philadelphia metro could see $346.8 million,” the report states.\n\nSeattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Joe Nguyen also referenced last year's Chamber of Commerce report and Tuesday's Puget Sound Business Journal story in touting the Seahawks' success translating into economic success for Seattle.\n\n\"Yes, this is true - a Seahawks Super Bowl appearance will likely deliver a real economic boost for Seattle! The U.S. Chamber of Commerce report from 2025 shows the Super Bowl drove hundreds of millions to more than $1 billion in spending nationwide, with increased demand for food, apparel, hospitality, and entertainment reaching cities like Seattle even when they aren’t hosting (Seattle's estimated benefit in 2025 was $224,636,077),\" he said in a statement to The Center Square.\n\n\"The Puget Sound Business Journal reports that Seattle retailers and restaurants are already seeing higher sales tied to the Seahawks playoff run, especially in merchandise and game-day traffic. Super Bowl Sunday will likely up that spending across Seattle’s retail and hospitality sectors, including in the next 12 days leading up to the game.”\n\nWhile Seattle is experiencing an economic surge during playoff games, this is most likely a temporary effect that won’t fundamentally transform the city's overall economy.\n\nWhile civic boosters and the National Football League often project high economic impact figures, research suggests the true benefit is often a fraction of those, according to researchers from North Caroline State University.\n\nThe university’s report, released earlier this month, argues that the Super Bowl's economic impact on host cities is often exaggerated, with benefits frequently falling short of promises while the NFL captures the majority of revenue. While the event drives immense commercial value, local, long-term economic gains are limited, while public costs for infrastructure and security are high.\n\nWhile the economic impact of the NFL playoffs in Seattle is often substantial, the fungibility of money suggests the total impact might be lower than advertised. Much of this spending is often diverted from other local entertainment rather than entirely new, outside money entering the economy.\n\nA Super Bowl run is about much more than money, Scholes acknowledged.\n\n“A Seahawks march to the Super Bowl just months after the Mariners made a postseason run helps generate a continued sense of optimism and community,” he said. “The civic pride extends beyond the playing field and has the potential to drive, on some level, a positive reputational jolt.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers may soon be looking for another goalie.\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs could be a good match for a potential trade.\n\nThat's the idea suggested in a new article for Daily Faceoff by Anthony Di Marco.\n\nHe suggests that the Flyers need to move on from Sam Ersson, who might be \"the league's worst goaltender,\" he writes.\n\n\"Speaking with a team source Tuesday morning, there doesn’t appear to be an imminent plan to replace Ersson in-season,\" Di Marco writes. \"After the season is a different story, as I’ve heard going back 24 months now that the 2026 off-season would give the Flyers clarity on their goaltending picture heading into the future.\"\n\nMORE: Why Craig Berube has a huge cut on his head\n\nSpecifically, Di Marco wonders if the Flyers could go after Toronto's Dennis Hildeby, who doesn't have a great path to time behind Joseph Wall and Anthony Stolarz.\n\n\"Woll and Stolarz are signed for two and four seasons beyond this year, respectively, and Hildeby is set to be waiver eligible starting next season with two years left on his current contract,\" Di Marco writes. \"The Leafs have some of their best goaltending depth in a long time considering Artur Akhtyamov has also established himself as a viable prospect in the AHL.\"\n\nDi Marco adds, \"Hildeby is someone I know the Flyers like.\"\n\nMORE: This save from Tristan Jarry makes no sense after he lost his skate blade\n\n\"Is he available? That much is uncertain, but he may be the Leafs’ best trade chip if they want to make an addition ahead of the trade deadline,\" Hildeby writes. \"With no first-round picks in each of the next two drafts and their top prospect, Easton Cowan, already on the roster, they don’t have much in the way of trade currency. Hildeby, if made available, could be just that. At the same time, the very thing that makes him valuable is a reason to keep him: he’s signed through 2027-28 at an $841,667 cap hit.\"\n\nThere are a lot of questions to be answered here, and it sounds more like an offseason deal if anything, but it's worth keeping an eye on for the Flyers.\n\nJason Robertson shows how big a mistake Team USA made\n\nEvgeni Malkin's future with the Penguins may have changed\n\nEvan Bouchard joins Bobby Orr in the history books\n\nElias Pettersson takes a bold trade stance\n\nMaple Leafs can trade for veteran who already likes playing in Toronto\n\nSenators warned about looming trade of $57.5 million star",

    "fullText": "Look, we get it. The most recent Philadelphia Eagles season was stressful. They lost games they had no business losing, and even when they won, it often seemed as though they were more lucky than deserving. We can still see Jordan Davis blocking a last-second field-goal attempt and running to paydirt to claim victory from what seemed like certain defeat.\n\nVic Fangio's defense was up to the task when they weren't victims of offensive inefficiency-induced exhaustion. Without Kevin Patullo's unit's support, they sometimes had to endure workdays longer than they expected.\n\nWe thought the offense would figure things out. They never did, and eventually all of their flaws caught up with them. Everything imploded with a loss to the San Francisco 49ers in the Wild Card Round, eventually leading to Patullo being shown the door.\n\nWe're nearly two weeks removed from the end-of-season press conference featuring Nick Sirianni and Howie Roseman, where both promised a wide-ranging search for the next offensive coordinator. So why the frustration now that they're doing exactly that?\n\nHere's where most can agree: when things are going well, this organization is praised as one of the NFL's best-run. This is a chance to reinforce that reputation, not abandon it. The search isn't over, yet hope has already given way to anxiety for some.\n\nThe truth is simple. No one knows whether this OC search will succeed or fail. Not yet. The Eagles know what they're looking for, and history suggests that when they're allowed to conduct a thorough process, they usually get it right.\n\nEveryone loved the Chip Kelly hire. Remember him? That was a rushed decision. Meanwhile, Andy Reid, Doug Pederson, Nick Sirianni, and Shane Steichen were all met with skepticism. Each worked out just fine.\n\nPatience isn't blind faith. It's trusting a process that has earned it. Yikes. Maybe we shouldn't say 'trust the process' in Philadelphia. You get the idea, though. Until proven otherwise, the Eagles deserve that much. There's no sense in doubting this organization now.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: Eagles have earned the benefit of the doubt with OC search",

    "description": "McCarthy is the fourth Steelers head coach in 57 years.",
    "fullText": "A new era of Pittsburgh Steelers football began on Tuesday afternoon inside the PNC Champions Club at Acrisure Stadium.  62-year-old Greenfield native and Super Bowl XLV Champion Mike McCarthy is the 17th head coach in Steelers history.\n\nIntroduced alongside owner/president Art Rooney II and general manager Omar Khan, McCarthy introduced his plan for the Steelers in his attempt to win his childhood team its seventh Lombardi Trophy. After taking the floor and saying an emphatic “Here We Go” as he rubbed his hands back and forth, McCarthy couldn’t even begin his opening statement without getting emotional.\n\n“Oftentimes, coaches and players put on new team colors, and it takes a minute to feel comfortable in those new colors,” McCarthy said before pausing and getting emotional again. “But to be blessed beyond any measure, one day to put on the colors you wore… when you came home from Mercy Hospital.”\n\nAwesome seeing how choked up Mike McCarthy got talking about being from Pittsburgh pic.twitter.com/L20jGLxfaE\n\n— Austin Bechtold (@AustinRBechtold) January 27, 2026\n\nMcCarthy inherits a franchise that hasn’t won a playoff game since 2016 and has been running in place the past three years with 10-7 seasons resulting in lopsided losses in the wild card round.\n\nHe understands the weight of being the Steelers’ leader and the responsibility at hand to ensure this fresh start ends\n\n“I want to thank Art Rooney II, Omar Khan, Dan Rooney, and the entire Steelers organization for the trust they’ve placed in me to represent one of the most storied franchises in all of sports,” McCarthy said.\n\nMcCarthy replaces Mike Tomlin, who stepped down after a seventh consecutive playoff loss and a historic 19-year run leading the Steelers\n\n“I understand and embrace the responsibility, privilege, and the weight that comes with this stewardship,” McCarthy said.\n\nThe amount of pride in being from Pittsburgh is evident from your neighbor or community, to Pat McAfee and others on national TV, to Joe Manganiello and Billy Gardell in Hollywood. Pittsburgh people love where they’re from. McCarthy is one and the same as the rest of Pittsburgh natives.\n\n“This city, this franchise, this fan base means the world to me. Because Pittsburgh’s my world,” McCarthy said, tapping his chest. “It’s just awesome to be back here.”\n\nMcCarthy thanked friends Tomlin and Bill Cowher, whom he said represented the team with class, and he is honored to follow in their footsteps.\n\nHe thanked his family and said they can now proudly wear their Steelers swag and not hide the love they have for the team. But now the work begins to ensure the Steelers return to prominence.\n\n“My heart is full, my focus is singular, and it’s time to bring another championship back to this great city,” McCarthy said. “With that, I just want to make sure that when we do get that seventh trophy in the case, we’ll start that victory parade at 1137 Greenfield Ave.”",

    "title": "San Diegan Xander Schauffele makes a case for Torrey Pines having prominent spot on future PGA Tour schedule",
    "description": "Xander Schauffele thinks that his hometown of San Diego and the Torrey Pines golf courses likely will remain in a prominent place on the PGA Tour's schedule in the future",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — Xander Schauffele was born in a hospital in La Jolla that is 2½ miles from the clubhouse at the Torrey Pines golf municipal courses. He played high school and college golf atop the cliffs, built a dream home eight miles away and has competed in the Farmers Insurance Open in every season he’s been a pro, save last year when he was dealing with an injury.\n\nSo, yes, he’ll be the first to admit he’s biased when it comes to seeing Torrey Pines and San Diego remain on the PGA Tour schedule in perpetuity—at a time when there is so much speculation about which tournaments will remain and which will disappear when the Future Competitions Committee (FCC) makes it recommendations sometime in the next few months.\n\nOn Tuesday, ahead of Thursday’s start of the last San Diego tournament that will be sponsored by Farmers Insurance, Schauffele admitted that he’s hardly the guy tying himself to a Torrey pine tree to save the event. But he also doesn’t seem overly concerned that the tournament is in danger of going away.\n\n“I think I would feel like Torrey's safe if you kind of look at the schedule, just from it should find a home because this property's iconic,” said the 10-time tour winner. “It's a beautiful property, it's a big property, it's a tough golf course, and it usually has pretty good winners on it.”\n\nSchauffele then pointed out the impact that Tiger Woods has had on Torrey Pines, and vice versa. Woods, who happens to lead the FCC, won here eight times, including the epic 2008 U.S. Open, and in turn, people flock to the site from all over the world and television viewers can likely recall memorable holes and shots at Torrey as much as most venues on tour.\n\n“I think Tiger single-handedly has made this property incredibly special in terms of a history in golf, just tying back to the '08 U.S. Open,” said Schauffele, who on-site as a youngster and scrambling to see Woods’ incredible Sunday putt at 18 in ’08. “You look at pretty golf courses that we have on tour, I'd say Torrey's one of them. I wouldn't be shocked if it was somewhere on the schedule.\n\n“I couldn't answer when or who would want to be a sponsor or something of that nature, but I think it's a strong enough course and a big enough course, a championship course to be on the schedule still.”\n\nWith talk that the Hawaiian Swing’s season-opening tournaments on Maui and Oahu might go away permanently after this season, and with the San Diego event looking for a new sponsor, speculation turns to the remaining events on the West Coast Swing. Pebble Beach and Riviera already host signature events, leaving The American Express and San Diego as those tournaments \n\nThe Sentry, also a signature tournament and previously at Kapalua, seemingly would need a home, and The American Express is a three-course pro-am that wouldn’t appear conducive to hosting a limited field. That would seemingly leave Torrey Pines as a strong possible landing spot for The Sentry on the South Course. Tour officials are declining comment until the FCC delivers its report.\n\nFor Schauffele, with no Sentry at which to start the season, he skipped the first two events and begins at Torrey Pines, where, curiously, he has only two top-10 finishes in nine starts. He missed last year with a rib cage injury that ended up creating a sluggish start and middling play that led to him missing the Tour Championship for the first time.\n\nSchauffele called it a “bad year,” but it ended on a couple of very high notes. He and his wife, Maya, had their first child, a boy they named Victor, in late August, and in October, Schauffele shot 64 in the final round to win the Baycurrent Championship in Japan—the country in which his mother was raised.\n\nOf what it meant to get that season-ending win, Schauffele said, “We had a kid, and, obviously, I'm going to take advantage and spend as much time with him and my wife. It was a big goal of mine to play well. So, I just know myself—if I didn't play well in Japan, I would have been super pumped to be there and be present [with him family], obviously, but at the same time something would have been just scratching at the back of my head of just like, ‘you suck,’ you know what I mean? You've got to play a lot better.”",

    "fullText": "The Denver Broncos announced that they have fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi, wide receivers coach Keary Colbert, and cornerbacks coach Addison Lynch.\n\nWe’ve parted ways with three assistant coaches.\n\n— Denver Broncos (@Broncos) January 28, 2026\n\nSean Payton and the Broncos released a statement thanking all three coaches for their contributions to the team and wished them all the best in the future.\n\n“I want to thank these coaches for playing an important role in elevating our program over the last three seasons,” Payton said. “I’ve been fortunate to work with Joe Lombardi for 15 years and am particularly grateful for his many contributions to our success as offensive coordinator.\n\n“We sincerely appreciate Joe, Keary and Addison’s hard work and wish them all the best in the future.”\n\nThis comes as a bit of a surprise, as Lombardi has been one of Sean Payton’s most trusted coaches in recent seasons. Could this mean that the Broncos are making a play to keep offensive pass game coordinator/quarterbacks coach Davis Webb? He is a favorite for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job, so it’ll be interesting to see how that plays out.\n\nLombardi served as the Broncos’ offensive coordinator since the team hired Sean Payton back in 2023 and had previous experience with Payton during his time with the Saints. However, the Broncos’ struggles on offense, which Payton talked about today, may have contributed to this firing.\n\nEarlier today, during the end of the year press conference, Payton was asked about the struggling run game and told reporters that improving in that area is “one of the key things we have to do this offseason”.\n\n“Great question. I stepped into [Offensive Run Game Coordinator/Assistant Head Coach] Zach [Strief]’s office yesterday. I said look… There’s probably a series of answers to that. That what we’re doing… I feel like we’re far enough along with the RPOs and some of that but when we want to run it under center and control a game, we’ve been able to do it a few times, but not as much as I’d like. That’ll be an important study and with urgency, and then also with the runners, who are we asking… Losing [RB] J.K. [Dobbins], obviously, that was a tough loss. He brought a lot to the locker, more than you would know. But that’ll be one of the points of emphasis that I think that we research and look into heavily. I want to play from the gun, but I also will always want to play with a two-back or multiple tight end mindset [and] have that flexibility. It’s a good question. I think it’s one of the key things that we have to do this offseason.”\n\nThen he was asked about the drops that plagued the Broncos’ offense late this season and throughout the playoffs. He talked about how he likes his wide receiver room and how it has everything he wants at the position, but that there is a proper way to catch a football. He added they have to be better at teaching that this offseason.\n\n“Look, we drafted to it, and I like who we’ve drafted to it. Yes, there were too many [drops] even down the stretch. The thing with the draft, man, we’ve invested, and I like the players in that room. We’ve got different… We have speed, we have size, we have all the things I’m used to [and] you’d want to have in a good offense. But I think that there’s a proper way to catch a football, and most of the time, it’s with your thumbs together, not the other way around. The other way around, I’m serious, only exists when the ball is below your belly button. Even the deep balls should be caught with your thumbs together. So we have to be better at that.”\n\nNow, did I anticipate that this would lead to Lombardi’s firing? I did not, but it is interesting to see what changes Payton makes to his coaching staff.\n\nPass game coordinator/quarterbacks coach Davis Webb would be the logical in-house replacement, but he is in the running to be the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders. Regardless, the Broncos will have to interview at least two minority candidates to fulfill the Rooney Rule, so we will have to see which direction Payton and the team decides to go.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks traded for wide receiver Rashid Shaheed during the 2025 trade deadline, but the team will already have to make a decision on his future in the offseason.\n\nShaheed is set to enter free agency in the spring, and though Seattle could look to retain him, YardBarker's Seth Trachtman predicts the dynamic receiver will pack his bags and head to the Mile High to sign with the Denver Broncos.\n\nHere is what Trachtman said about Shaheed and his potential fit in Denver:\n\n\"Shaheed and Sean Payton didn't overlap in New Orleans, with Payton departing following the 2021 season and Shaheed signing out of the draft in 2022. Still, he's likely very familiar with the explosive wideout and kick returner, and Shaheed's skillset would be a perfect fit for a Broncos squad that needs more explosive weapons.\"\n\nShaheed hasn't had a very productive 2025 campaign, tallying 499 yards and two touchdowns in the regular season, including just 188 yards with Seattle.\n\nHowever, the 27-year-old has shown that he can be an explosive playmaker. Shaheed also provides production in the return game, two Pro Bowls, and a first-team All-Pro selection in 2023 for his work on special teams.\n\nIn the right offense, Shaheed could blossom into a star playmaker. The Broncos need to supply quarterback Bo Nix with more weapons, and Shaheed would immediately step in as a primary deep threat in Denver's offense.\n\nThe Broncos are slated to have $27 million in cap space this offseason. Spotrac projects Shaheed will land a deal worth $42.3 million over three seasons, which averages to $14.1 million annually.\n\nThough Shaheed may not be worth the price for some, the Broncos need receiving talent, and Shaheed still has promise with his game-breaking speed and big-play ability.

    "fullText": "“Thug Rose” is going under the knife.\n\nFormer two-time Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Strawweight champion Rose Namajunas saw her title hopes at a second weight class come to a screeching halt this past weekend (Sat., Jan. 24, 2026), dropping a close unanimous decision to No. 1 Flyweight contender Natalia Silva at UFC 324 inside T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAs if the loss itself wasn’t brutal enough, Namajunas revealed she’s now facing a lengthy recovery after suffering a serious eye injury during the fight. Earlier today, the 33-year-old shared on Instagram that she was scheduled to undergo canalicular tube surgery — a procedure to repair a torn tear-duct system caused by repeated eye pokes.\n\n“Alright, guys, I’m headed into surgery,” Namajunas said on Instagram today. “Canalicular tube surgery. I got poked in the eye a few times in the fight, so yeah. But my tube is torn so it’s going to be repaired right now. I’m going to have a silicone tube in my eye. Three months, so pray for me, guys. Just glad we can get it fixed.”\n\nCanalicular tube surgery is no small matter. The procedure repairs a torn tear drainage canal in the inner corner of the eyelid — an injury that can cause constant watering, irritation, and vision issues if left untreated. An oculoplastic surgeon reconnects the damaged tissue and inserts a small silicone stent to keep the duct open while it heals. The stent typically remains in place for three to six months before being removed in-office.\n\nThe stent stays in for 3–6 months before easy removal in the office. When done soon after injury, it usually restores normal tear drainage successfully, though fighters face temporary discomfort and limited training during recovery.\n\nAccording to Ariel Helwani, Namajunas also won’t be able to sneeze or blow her nose for the next three months — an uncomfortable but necessary precaution during recovery. Yikes.\n\nThe timing couldn’t be worse for Namajunas, who reportedly had a guaranteed title shot against Flyweight champion Valentina Shevchenko lined up with a win over Silva. Instead, she’ll be sidelined and forced to rebuild yet again in a crowded division.\n\nNamajunas is now 1–2 in her last three fights and sits at 3–3 since moving up to Flyweight. While her championship dreams aren’t officially dead, the road back just got significantly longer — and more painful.\n\nFor more UFC 324: “Gaethje vs. Pimblett” news and notes be sure to hit up our comprehensive event archive right here.",

    "fullText": "Independiente Santa Fe continues to add young talent to its sports project for the 2026 season. In recent hours, it was confirmed that Kilian Toscano, a 21-year-old midfielder, will join the \"Cardenal\" squad after reaching a loan agreement with Atlético Nacional. The young player, who is looking to establish himself in the capital, arrives with the mission of bringing balance and dynamism to the midfield of the team led by Pablo Peirano.\n\nDespite his young age, Toscano is no rookie in professional football. The midfielder already boasts 39 official matches, the vast majority of them wearing the verdolaga jersey, where he demonstrated his abilities in ball recovery and initiating play. Additionally, his talent led him to participate in several processes with the Colombia U-20 National Team during the Argentina 2023 World Cup cycle, although he ultimately was not included in the final squad for the global event.\n\nThis move represents the first change of scenery for Toscano, who completed his entire youth development in Medellín. For Santa Fe, the addition of the young player responds to the need to refresh the squad with promising players who are already familiar with the demands of big clubs. The footballer is expected to join training at the Tenjo facility immediately to compete for a spot in the starting eleven before the league begins.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "River Plate and Gimnasia LP face each other this Wednesday at 8:00 PM at the Estadio Monumental for the second round of the 2026 Torneo Apertura. After a victorious debut against Barracas Central, Marcelo Gallardo’s team looks to confirm their football improvement against a “Lobo” side that arrives in high spirits after defeating Racing.\n\nThe big question mark in Núñez remains the goalkeeper position. Due to Franco Armani’s inflamed heel, the young Santiago Beltrán will stay between the posts. In defense, Matías Viña will continue as left back, as Marcos Acuña will be rested. The midfield will be led by the balance of Aníbal Moreno and Fausto Vera, while in attack, Sebastián Driussi and Facundo Colidio will be the main goal threats.\n\nThe match will have a special emotional charge: the return of Nacho Fernández to the Monumental, this time as captain and leader of Gimnasia. Zarinatto’s team arrives consolidated, with the only doubt being whether to keep Silva Torrejón or include the young Gelsomino.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Rebecca Yarros' \"Fourth Wing\" is being turned into an Amazon series. Producer Michael B. Jordan recently assured fans that the show is on its way.",
    "fullText": "At this point, it's hard not to be familiar with Rebecca Yarros' \"Empyrean\" series about dragon rider Violet Sorrengail.\n\nWhen \"Onyx Storm,\" the third book in the romantasy series, was released in January 2025, it became the fastest-selling adult novel in 20 years.\n\nYarros is taking a break from the \"Empyrean\" series before writing the fourth installment, but in the meantime, we're getting closer to a series adaptation of \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nIn October 2023, Deadline announced that Amazon MGM Studios and Oscar nominee Michael B. Jordan's Outlier Society were developing \"Fourth Wing\" into a Prime Video series. Yarros is an executive producer for the show.\n\nOutlier Society produced Jordan's \"Creed III\" and is developing a slate of other series and films in addition to \"Fourth Wing.\"\n\nDeadline also reported in October 2023 that Amazon MGM Studios had acquired the rights to the entire \"Empyrean\" series. In her January 2025 Variety interview, Yarros said she had shared the \"five-book arc\" for the \"Empyrean\" series with Amazon.\n\n\"They have the five-book arc, which went a little awry in Book 3 just because the positioning, but they already know that,\" she told Variety. \"But they have the five-book arc and the general big points of what happens in between each book, but they don't have the specifics between Book 4 and Book 5, because I'm getting ready to go to my crazy plotting board and and plot out every single event that happens in each book, so that I make sure that I'm within my two books there.\"\n\nIn July 2024, Outlier Society announced it had hired Moira Walley-Beckett, who worked on shows like \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Anne with an E,\" as the showrunner for the series. In a January 2025 interview with Variety, Yarros said Walley-Beckett was \"great\" and \"phenomenal,\" but in July 2025, Walley-Beckett exited the project.\n\nJac Schaeffer, best known for her work on Disney's \"WandaVision\" and \"Agatha All Along,\" was rumored to be in talks to step into the showrunner role. However, in September 2025, Variety and Deadline reported that Amazon was hiring Meredith Averill.\n\nAverill was previously the showrunner of the Netflix series \"Locke & Key\" and a producer on shows like \"The Good Wife\" and \"The Haunting of Hill House.\"\n\nAmazon declined to comment on this piece when contacted by Business Insider, but Yarros shared a screenshot of Deadline's article on her Instagram when the showrunner announcement dropped.\n\n\"Welcome to the team, Meredith Averill! Guys, I love everything this wonderful woman has worked on and I'm so excited to have her joining us,\" Yarros said in her caption.\n\nNeither Amazon nor Outlier Society has announced any casting or release dates for the series. Still, in January 2026, Jordan assured fans it was on its way in an interview with Deadline.\n\n\"We are making sure that this is going to be an exciting show that delivers on all of the things the fans want and some of the things that they won't be expecting either,\" Jordan said.\n\nHe also told the outlet he's aware of how much fans of \"Fourth Wing\" care about the series.\n\n\"But trust me, I know how beloved this franchise IP is,\" he said. \"It's early stages, but I feel how much people care about this one. It's not lost on us.\"\n\nAlthough details about the series are limited, Yarros made a few comments about the show while promoting \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nSpeaking at an engagement on January 24, 2025, in New York, Yarros told fans she had read the pilot for the \"Fourth Wing\" show — and loved it.\n\n\"I read the latest version of the pilot last week,\" she said. \"It's really nerve-racking when you read something like that because you're really — you're trusting someone else with your baby, right? And you're trusting someone else to say, like, 'Hey, this is important in your work, and this isn't,' and you kinda get your guard up.\"\n\n\"But guys, I, like, kicked my feet the whole time,\" she said. \"You're gonna love it.\"\n\nYarros also praised Walley-Beckett at the event, calling her a \"brilliant writer\" and saying she maintained the integrity of the book in the pilot. It's unclear how the pilot may have changed since Walley-Beckett's exit from the project.\n\nSpeaking at an event in London on August 30, 2024, Yarros said casting will ultimately fall on the show's staff, not her. She also said she intentionally hasn't shared any specific actors she hopes will be cast in the series.\n\n\"I will never say who my perfect fan cast is because the cast is so diverse, and I want to open that up to more diversity,\" she said. \"And I feel like the second I say who I think this character is, that's who everyone will accept. That's only who they will accept.\"\n\n\"I kinda hope they find, like, an up-and-coming generation,\" she added. \"But I would never put my fan cast in your heads.\"\n\nAlthough she won't be involved in casting the series, Yarros said at the same event that she has one hard-line casting request she has communicated to Amazon and Outlier Society.\n\n\"They know how staunch I am against whitewashing Xaden,\" she said. \"I think that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nXaden Riorson, Violet's love interest in the series, is described as having \"warm tawny skin\" in \"Fourth Wing\" and \"tawny-brown\" skin in both \"Iron Flame\" and \"Onyx Storm.\"",

    "fullText": "Health-insurance stocks plunged on Tuesday amid the latest updates from the White House on Medicare plan payments for next year.\n\nMajor insurers saw their stocks tumble sharply after the Trump administration proposed holding Medicare payments roughly flat in 2027. The small-than-expected increase comes amid concerns about rising health costs.\n\nHere were the big movers in Tuesday's session:\n\nUnitedHealth Group released fourth-quarter earnings before Tuesday's opening bell, with RBC analysts saying the earnings print and 2026 outlook were both \"solid.\" They chalked up the big slide in the shares to the latest insurance updates from the administration.\n\nDuring the earnings call, UnitedHealthcare CEO Tim Noel called the CMS proposal \"disappointing,\" saying if finalized, \"it will mean very meaningful benefit reductions.\"\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed a net average year-over-year payment increase of 0.09% in 2027 for Medicare Advantage members. In comparison, Medicare Advantage payments in 2026 rose 5.06% from 2025.\n\nThe proposed payment increase was well below Wall Street's expectations, with RBC Capital Markets analysts expecting an \"at least a mid-single digit increase.\" The analysts noted that historically, the final payment rate is higher than the initial proposal.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, CMS administrator, said the \"proposed payment policies are about making sure Medicare Advantage works better for the people it serves,\" while \"protecting taxpayers from unnecessary spending that is not oriented towards addressing real health needs.\"\n\nThe CMS proposal also includes updates to the Medicare Advantage risk adjustment model, such as excluding diagnosis information not associated with a specific beneficiary encounter.",

    "description": "Former high-end real estate brokers Tal and Oren, plus Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, face up to life behind bars if convicted.",
    "fullText": "Former top ultra-luxury real estate broker brothers Oren and Tal Alexander, along with a third sibling, are sexual predators who together raped dozens of women and girls and then \"celebrated their crimes,\" a federal prosecutor told jurors on Tuesday.\n\nOver more than a decade, Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander, \"used whatever means necessary\" — including drugging victims and using \"brute force\" — to carry out the attacks, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser said in her opening statement at the brothers' Manhattan sex-trafficking trial.\n\nThe Alexander brothers face a dozen felony counts, including conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and the sexual exploitation of a minor. They have vehemently denied the sex crimes charges against them, as well as all other allegations.\n\nIf convicted at trial, Tal Alexander, 39, and the twins, 38, could face up to life behind bars. It would mark a dramatic fall for the real estate agent brothers who built their careers on high-end luxury deals with notable clients, including Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, financier Leon Black, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nSmyser told the six-man, six-woman jury on Tuesday, that the Alexanders used \"power, wealth, and access to lure women and girls to them\" at swanky locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\n\"They physically held victims down\" and put drugs like GHB and Xanax in their drinks, getting the women so intoxicated that, in one instance, their victim could not stand up, Smyser said.\n\n\"You'll hear from a woman who Tal held down, while Alon and two others raped that woman,\" said Smyser said, adding that the woman was 16 years old at the time.\n\n\"You will also learn that the defendants celebrated their crimes,\" said the prosecutor. \"For example, after Oren and Alon sexually assaulted three high school girls in a hotel room, Oren texted a friend that he took down a 17-year-old.\"\n\nThe brothers told each other in text messages that \"the only thing that could bring them down is if some 'hoe' complained,\" Smyser told the jurors.\n\nAn accuser using the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" was the first government witness to testify on Tuesday. She broke down in tears as she told the jury she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012 when she was 20 years old.\n\nMoore said that she woke up naked with Alon Alexander standing over her, also naked, at the Manhattan apartment he shared with Tal Alexander, in the hours after an NBA Finals viewing party at the nearby penthouse of actor Zac Efron.\n\nShe described screaming \"no\" as she said she was assaulted.\n\nDefense attorneys for the brothers painted a starkly different portrayal of the sibling trio for the jury, saying that the Alexanders led a party-fueled lifestyle that involved lots and lots of consensual sex.\n\nThe brothers may be \"arrogant\" \"womanizers,\" but they are no sex traffickers, the lawyers said in their remarks, alleging that the accusers in the case are out for money.\n\n\"This case is about shame, opportunity, and money,\" Oren Alexander's attorney, Teny Geragos — who represented Sean \"Diddy\" Combs at his sex-trafficking trial last year — said in her opening statement.\n\nThe Alexanders, each wearing a suit jacket with a white dress shirt, listened intently while lawyers for Oren and Tal Alexander delivered separate opening statements, sometimes leaning forward in their seats at the defense table.\n\nGeragos described the Alexanders as successful and ambitious \"single men who liked to pursue women, at nightclubs, at bars, at restaurants, on apps — in other words, everywhere that single men in their 20s and 30s pursued women.\"\n\nThe women were attracted to the brothers and their lifestyle, and the brothers engaged in consensual sex with women who typically and amicably stayed in touch with them, she said.\n\nOren and Tal Alexander began their real estate careers at Douglas Elliman before launching their own brokerage, Official, in 2022. Alon Alexander was an executive at his family's private security firm.\n\n\"Remember, two things can be true at the same time,\" Gergaos told the jury. \"You may not approve of his lifestyle, but you can still find him not guilty of sex trafficking.\"\n\nGergaos argued that the Alexanders' accusers took drugs voluntarily and that no toxicology reports back up their accounts.\n\n\"Many of the accusers were ashamed after they had a one-night stand with one or more of the brothers,\" she said.\n\nTal Alexander's defense attorney, Deanna Paul, told the jury that the brothers were \"party boys\" and \"womanizers\" in their early 20s — but that this is not a crime.\n\n\"They slept with many, many women,\" Paul said, adding that the way the siblings talked about their sexual encounters was \"crude\" and \"arrogant,\" but it wasn't sex trafficking.\n\nThere was no \"commercial sex operation\" and no evidence that anyone was drugged involuntarily, Paul said. \"There are no contemporaneous reports to law enforcement,\" she added.\n\nThe judge overseeing the brothers' trial, US District Judge Valerie Caproni, has said that the trial is expected to last about a month, running through the end of February.",

    "title": "Meta's soaring capex is front and center for analysts ahead of the social media giant's Q4 earnings",
    "description": "Analysts are laser-focused on Meta's AI ambitions and its surging capex spending. The company reports Q4 earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech earnings are about to kick off in earnest, with Meta Platforms due to report results for the final quarter of 2025 on Wednesday.\n\nMeta stock has been highly volatile over the past year, remaining in the green but lagging behind some of its Magnificent Seven peers. The stock is up about 1% year-to-date and up 7% in the last 12 months.\n\nThe social media giant spent 2025 telling investors it would boost capex spending, hyping up its ambitious AI plans. Investors eventually balked at Meta and other tech titans' plans to keep increasing capex. Meta tumbled after its Q3 report, partly on its announcement that it plans to spend more than ever on AI infrastructure going forward.\n\nMeta latest announced it would significantly scale back its metaverse spending, touted by CEO Mark Zuckerberg as the company's future only a few years earlier.\n\nWall Street is estimating that the Facebook parent will report $58.4 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $8.19.\n\nHere's what analysts say they'll be listening for.\n\nBofA analysts expect Meta to slightly beat estimates, though they remain focused on the company's expense guide for the coming year. The bank has an $810 price target and a buy rating for the stock, implying 21% upside.\n\n\"Concerns on '26 expenses have been building for 5 months & we think an expense guide at around 30% 2026 growth could be positive, while at/above 35% a negative,\" said analyst Justin Post.\n\nHe added that his team expects Meta's capex spending to come in between $109 and $114 billion for the year, likely above Wall Street consensus of $110 billion.\n\nDeutsche analysts maintain a buy rating and a bullish price target of $880 for Meta stock, a 31% jump from current levels. But as analyst Benjamin Black notes, heading into the Q4 earnings call, concerns linger about this year's expenses.\n\nThat said, his team also predicts that Meta's revenue will come in at $59 billion, just above Wall Street estimates.\n\n\"In our view, Meta is positioned favorably — especially in the long-term — as it doubles down on an AI investment cycle,\" Black said.\n\nLike its peers, Goldman analysts remain focused on Meta's capex plans, which they believe will continue to drive growth into 2026 and beyond. The bank recently raised its spending projections for the company, already above analyst estimates, noting that it sees upward pressure on consensus capex estimates.\n\n\"On the next earnings call, we expect investors will be focused on any updates on the work of the Meta Superintelligence Lab, the timing of any foundational model work and/or any strategies with respect to consumer or enterprise utility around AI,\" Goldman analysts stated.\n\nRothschild has a $900 price target for Meta stock, one of the highest on Wall Street. Its target represents a 34% increase from levels on Tuesday. Analyst James Cordwell sees Meta as one of the tech sector's best-positioned companies to capitalize on rising AI demand.\n\n\"The recent focus regarding Meta has been dominated by how the company might guide for FY26 operating expenses and capital expenditure,\" he stated. \"The fear is that this is 'Zuckerberg unleashed', with the company's CEO truly back in 'founder mode', pursuing his AI dreams whatever the financial cost.\"\n\nThe analyst added that this has prompted Rothschild to increase its full-year capex projection for Meta to $117.1 billion.\n\nTD Cowen is bullish on Meta ahead of its Wednesday earnings report, predicting generative AI tools will continue to support growth in its advertising business.\n\nAnalyst John Blackedge said he believes ad growth will help bolster its high capex spending.\n\n\"Key at the 4Q25 print will be mgmt's '26 capex and opex guides,\" he said. \"We currently expect '26 capex of $125.0BN, up 76% y/y and 14% above consensus alongside '26 opex of $156.1BN, up 32.9% y/y and 7% above consensus.\"",

    "fullText": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is ordering state agencies and public universities in Texas to halt H-1B hiring, the latest setback for foreign workers looking to work in the US.\n\nIn a letter to Texas state agency heads on Tuesday, Abbott wrote that there had been \"recent reports of abuse\" in the H-1B visa program, which is designed to bring high-skilled foreign workers to the US.\n\n\"Texas taxpayers invest billions to train our workforce,\" Abbott wrote on X. \"Those jobs should go to Texans.\"\n\nAbbott is also directing agencies and universities to provide information on how many petitions they submitted in 2025, how many visa holders they currently sponsor, their countries of origin, and more.\n\nThe freeze is set to last through May 2027, and includes exceptions for instances in which written permission from the Texas Workforce Commission is given.\n\n\"Rather than serving its intended purpose of attracting the best and brightest individuals from around the world to our nation to fill truly specialized and unmet labor needs, the program has too often been used to fill jobs that otherwise could—and should— have been filled by Texans,\" Abbott wrote.\n\nTexas has the second-most H-1B visa holders, trailing only California.\n\nAs of 2025, more than 40,000 beneficiaries were approved to work for more than 6,100 employers, according to data from US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nAccording to that data, at least 1,200 H-1B visa holders work at various public universities in the state, including the University of Texas system, Texas A&M University, Texas Tech, and others.\n\nThe top employers for H-1B visa holders in Texas are IT companies and tech firms, including Oracle and Tesla.\n\nThe governor's directive comes as President Donald Trump's administration has upended the H-1B visa program more broadly.\n\nIn September, Trump moved to impose a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, initially causing chaos at some major tech companies amid confusion over whether that fee applies to current employees who leave the country.\n\nThe administration rolled out social media screening requirements for visa holders in December, leading some firms to warn their employees against traveling outside the country.\n\nH-1B visas have proven to be a divisive issue within Trump's coalition, with some — most notably Elon Musk — arguing that the US must continue to bring in foreign talent to remain globally competitive.\n\nProminent business leaders who previously worked in the US under an H-1B visa include Musk, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Arista Networks CEO Jayshree Ullal, and Jeffrey Skoll, the first president of eBay.",

    "description": "Some may be surprised that famous musicians like Jimi Hendrix and Jennifer Lopez have lost all their Grammy nominations and never won an award.",
    "fullText": "The Grammy Awards have been recognizing some of the most talented musicians of the year since 1959.\n\nIt's often assumed that all of the legendary hit-makers have taken home a statuette or two — but there are actually quite a few iconic artists who seem to narrowly lose out year after year.\n\nHere are 21 artists who've never won a Grammy, ranked by how many nominations they've received.\n\nNominated 17 times since the 1990s, singer-songwriter Brian McKnight has yet to win his first Grammy.\n\nHe lost his last nomination for best male R&B vocal performance to Prince at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards, which were held in 2005.\n\nAt 16 nominations, the rapper only trails McKnight by one, but the two have even \n\nCalvin Broadus, better known as Snoop Dogg, also received his first nod in the early 1990s and, like McKnight, is still awaiting his first Grammy win.\n\nThe Icelandic singer, songwriter, actor, record producer, and DJ has been nominated 16 times across the past few decades, but Björk has never brought home a Grammy.\n\nShe was most recently nominated for best alternative music album at the 65th Annual Grammys.\n\nHis first nominations were for the hit \"Every Mile A Memory\" at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007.\n\nHowever, even after 15 nominations, country singer Dierks Bentley hasn't won.\n\nShe's racked up 14 nominations over the past few decades, but country singer Martina McBride has been beaten out each time.\n\nShe lost her latest nomination to Taylor Swift at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012.\n\nThough she has been nominated 13 times over the last decade, the former \"American Idol\" judge still doesn't have a Grammy award.\n\nThe legendary Diana Ross has never won a Grammy.\n\nHer first of 13 nominations was in the 1960s for \"Baby Love,\" and she was nominated nearly every year from 1970 to 1982 without a win.\n\nThat being said, the Recording Academy recognized the songstress and her musical accomplishments with a lifetime achievement award in 2012.\n\nNicki Minaj has been nominated for 12 Grammys.\n\nThe rapper lost best new artist to Bon Iver in 2012, to Kendrick Lamar in all three of her nominated categories in 2016, and to Killer Mike and Billie Eilish for her most recent nominations.\n\nNominated 12 times since 1996, Trevor Smith Jr., aka Busta Rhymes, hasn't yet won his first Grammy.\n\nHis last two nominations were for best rap performance and best rap song for the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, held in 2012.\n\nHe lost to Ye in both categories.\n\nSia has received nine nominations, but the singer-songwriter, record producer, and music video director has yet to win a Grammy.\n\nShe lost her most recent nomination for best song written for visual media to Lin-Manuel Miranda in 2018.\n\nThe country singer and former coach on \"The Voice\" has been nominated eight times, but Blake Shelton has no Grammy wins.\n\nHe most recently lost at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.\n\nDespite earning six nominations, including one posthumously, Tupac Shakur never won a Grammy.\n\nHe lost his first nominations in 1996 to Coolio and Naughty by Nature and lost his posthumous nomination to Eminem.\n\nAfter nearly 50 years of making music, Swedish pop group ABBA landed their first Grammy nomination for their comeback record \"I Still Have Faith In You\" at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards in 2022.\n\nThe band lost to Silk Sonic's \"Leave the Door Open.\"\n\nAlthough the group has never won a Grammy, their hit song \"Dancing Queen\" was inducted into the Recording Academy's Grammy Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nThe band also earned four more nominations for their 2021 album \"Voyage.\"\n\nAnother legendary band with only four nominations and zero Grammy wins is the Beach Boys.\n\nThey received three nominations in the 1960s for their hit \"Good Vibrations,\" and their last nod came in the late 1980s for \"Kokomo.\"\n\nAlthough they haven't received a Grammy, The Beach Boys earned a lifetime achievement award in 2001.\n\nFamous for his Las Vegas shows and for being a part of the iconic Rat Pack, Sammy Davis Jr. received three nominations but had no Grammy wins during his lifetime.\n\nHe died in 1990, but he earned a lifetime achievement award in 2001.\n\nJennifer Lopez racked up back-to-back nominations for best dance recording at the 42nd and 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in the early eughts.\n\nHowever, she lost to Cher's \"Believe\" and Baha Men's \"Who Let the Dogs Out.\"\n\nIconic hip-hop artists Run-D.M.C. have only been nominated for two Grammys.\n\nAt the 1987 awards show, they lost out to Prince for best R&B performance by a duo or group — the hip-hop category wasn't added for several more years.\n\nEven so, they received a lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy in 2016.\n\nMost recently, the group lost the award for best film music for \"Kings from Queens\" at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, which aired in 2025.\n\nDean Martin, another Rat Pack crooner, only received one Grammy nomination.\n\nHe was nominated for his album \"Everybody Loves Somebody,\" but lost to Louis Armstrong at the 1965 ceremony.\n\nAlthough Martin died in 1995, he was honored with a lifetime achievement award in 2009.\n\nThe former Smiths front man, who's released over 10 albums, has only been nominated for one Grammy.\n\nMorrissey lost out on his best alternative music album nomination to Tom Waits at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards, held in 1993.\n\nHis only nomination was in the '70s for his rendition of \"Star Spangled Banner.\"\n\nJimi Hendrix died in 1970, not long before the 13th Annual Grammy Awards broadcast. In 1992, though, the Recording Academy gave Hendrix a lifetime achievement award.\n\nThis story was originally published in March 2018 and most recently updated on January 27, 2026.",

    "description": "Bari Weiss was grilled by CBS News staffers in an all-hands meeting and said she's not \"a mouthpiece for anybody\" when asked about political bias.",
    "fullText": "CBS News employees put top editor Bari Weiss in the hot seat during an all-hands meeting on Tuesday, asking about her vision and standards for the nearly century-old broadcast network.\n\nThe first question in the Q&A part of her town hall asked how she would respond to criticism that CBS News is turning into \"a right-wing network\" under her leadership.\n\n\"I'm here to do one thing. It's not to be a mouthpiece for anybody. It's simply to be a mouthpiece for fairness and the pursuit of truth,\" Weiss said at the all-hands meeting, according to a recording obtained by Business Insider.\n\nWeiss, who became the editor in chief of CBS News in October after Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison bought her opinion site The Free Press, asked staffers to examine the coverage since her appointment.\n\n\"There's a lot of noise out there, but I would just urge anyone who suggests that to look at our work and judge for yourself,\" she said.\n\nWeiss was then asked how the network's news-gathering standards had changed since she took over.\n\n\"I don't think our standards have changed,\" she said, adding that the network was \"in very capable hands\" regarding editorial standards.\n\nWeiss caused a stir in December for a late-hour decision to delay a \"60 Minutes\" segment about the Trump administration deporting migrants to the CECOT prison in El Salvador. Critics questioned her commitment to hard-hitting journalism and wondered whether Paramount leadership was influencing editorial decisions at CBS News — a notion that Weiss strongly denied on Tuesday.\n\n\"I want to just say this as plainly and clearly as possible. I was not pressured by David Ellison or anyone else,\" Weiss said during the town hall. Weiss acknowledged that it was bad timing to delay the segment after commercials promoting it had already aired.\n\n\"I didn't know the screening schedule for every single thing, that specific logistical nightmare,\" she said. \"That's never going to happen again. So please rest assured that nothing of that kind is ever going to happen again. You have my promise.\"\n\nThat said, she added that \"asking \n\n\"I felt it was important to do our best to try and get a voice from the administration, and I'm always going to be pushing for that,\" Weiss said.\n\nWeiss had little experience in traditional TV before joining CBS News. Instead, she became known in 2020 for her dramatic exit from The New York Times, during which she alleged anti-conservative bias. Her next move, starting The Free Press, turned out to be lucrative when Ellison bought it for $150 million in October.\n\n\"Loving America is not about jingoism. It's not about blind patriotism,\" Weiss told employees. \"It's about vociferous defense of the principles and values that have made this country exceptional and that allow us to do the work that we do. And so anyone that disagrees with that, I'd love to have a conversation with you.\"\n\nWhen asked whether \"CBS Mornings\" would undergo another shake-up, Weiss noted that it had already undergone a major change, with longtime anchor Tony Dokoupil moving to the evening show.\n\n\"Speculation about Gayle King seems to be a favorite parlor game of a lot of newspapers and people in this building, and I just want everyone here to know that she's absolutely beloved and see her long into the future here at CBS,\" Weiss said.\n\nIn prepared remarks, Weiss said that CBS News needed to \"shift to a streaming mentality immediately\" and that if the broadcast network stuck mainly to its linear TV strategy, \"we're toast.\"\n\nWhen asked about staffing or potential layoffs at CBS News, Weiss said that she couldn't make any promises amid a \"tsunami of technological change.\"\n\n\"I can't stand up here and tell you that in a moment of incredible transformation that that's not going to mean transformation of our workforce,\" Weiss said. She added that CBS News is \"also hiring people to suit that.\"\n\nWeiss said that if she didn't believe digital revenue could eventually replace linear TV revenue, she \"wouldn't be standing here.\" She said that linear TV wouldn't go away, but that revenue would \"decline sharply, as will the audience.\"\n\n\"What winning looks like writ large for this company is building incredible journalism for audiences that are so much bigger than the one that we currently have and are maintaining on linear,\" Weiss said. \"That's what winning looks like. It's really simple.\"\n\nHave a tip or thoughts on Bari Weiss' strategy for CBS News? Contact this reporter via email at jfaris@businessinsider.com or Signal at @jamesfaris.01.

And I just don't want any of us to lose sight of who we are and the job that we do here.\"\n\nKing said that many of Weiss' critics hadn't taken the time to hear where she's coming from.\n\n\"They've never even heard your frigging voice,\" King said. \"So it's good for them to see you are a real person and this is what you want and how you feel about us and how you feel about this job.\"\n\nDuring the same town hall, Weiss addressed speculation about King's future, telling staffers that the TV personality is \"absolutely beloved\" and that she sees King staying at CBS \"long into the future.\"\n\nKing also took those rumors about her next stop head-on.\n\n\"I'm so proud to work at this company,\" King said. \"I'm one of the people that had been in the news, too. I read the shit, and I go, 'I don't even know where that's coming from.'\"\n\nLastly, King addressed \"the leakers in the building\" at CBS News who've been sharing memos and recordings.\n\n\"I would like to think that we can have conversations and that we could talk candidly with each other, and it's not going to frigging be in the paper,\" King said to applause. \"I'm so sick of that.

    "description": "Andrew Volk owns a restaurant in Portland, Maine. The city has seen an increased ICE presence, and he says it's already dampening the local business.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew M Volk, owner of Hunt & Alpine in Portland, Maine. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn mid-January, I gathered my staff of 10 for a training session on what to do if ICE agents showed up at my restaurant. It came after days of hearing how concerned the team was following news of an increased presence of ICE agents in Portland.\n\nThis is not the kind of information we, as restaurant workers, are accustomed to needing to know and relay. This is all so new. We're entering the unknown. And people are scared of the unknown.\n\nMy staff is scared. I'm scared.\n\nI personally know people, and have heard of many more, staying home because they are afraid of being harassed or picked up by ICE. I'm acquainted with people who have been taken, and I don't know where they are right now.\n\nMy two children have said there are dozens and dozens of kids in their school not showing up because their parents are afraid for their safety.\n\nEveryone has been holding their breath to see what happens next.\n\nMy restaurant is only two blocks from City Hall in downtown Portland. Scattered around our streets, I know there are ICE agents — they are there in plain sight — and it was understandable that my staff were worried about what to do if they knocked on our door. I had to support my staff by giving them some information and direction regarding what to do if one of the ICE agents showed up.\n\nWe learned agents can enter the restaurant, but they aren't entitled to go into private or locked areas without a judicial warrant (we had to define what this warrant is). We don't have to answer questions from agents, and we're allowed to record their actions and words.\n\nI want my staff to know that, although the presence of these agents feels unpredictable, I'm in this with them. We're in it together. I want to be able to talk about what we can control and understand as much information as possible in preparation.\n\nAlthough I can't fix this situation, I can communicate with the people around me to ensure they know I will support them and I will support their communities.\n\nI've owned my restaurant for 12 years. I'm white. I'm a heterosexual man. I don't present as someone who ICE might come after right now, so I want to use my voice in ways others are frightened to.\n\nI haven't had to close my restaurant's doors yet, but I know several restaurant owners who have had to do so on certain days because so many of their staff were too scared to show up to work. These are people who are legally allowed to be in the United States. These are people with no criminal history. And they are petrified to go to work.\n\nThis is going to dampen our local businesses if ICE agents remain in Portland. It already has.\n\nEditor's note: Business Insider reached out to ICE and CBP for comment.",

    "fullText": "Don't expect to see Sam Altman lamenting the absence of \"masculine energy\" in corporate America to Joe Rogan anytime soon.\n\nThe OpenAI CEO sent employees a message on Slack criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement — and appears to have taken the opportunity to also take a subtle jab at his rival, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe reference can be found where Altman wrote that OpenAI aims to \"not get blown around by changing fashions.\"\n\n\"We didn't start talking about masculine corporate energy when that was popular,\" Altman told employees.\n\nLast year, Zuckerberg championed a return to masculinity at Meta on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\"\n\n\"The masculine energy, I think, is good,\" Zuckerberg said in the January podcast episode. \"Society has plenty of that, but I think corporate culture was trying to get away from it.\"\n\nZuckerberg described the merits of a corporate culture that \"celebrates the aggression\" of business.\n\nThe Meta CEO said that the intent of corporate culture's shift away from masculinity was good. Women likely feel that companies are \"too masculine,\" he told Rogan, and that things are \"biased\" against them. But the shift had gone too far, the Facebook cofounder said.\n\n\"It's one thing to say we want to be welcoming and make a good environment for everyone,\" Zuckerberg said. \"It's another to basically say that masculinity is bad.\"\n\nAltman also wrote in his memo that OpenAI didn't \"become super woke when that was popular.\"\n\nMeta didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Altman's remark.\n\nAltman and Zuckerberg are currently engaged in a talent war for top AI researchers and engineers.\n\nZuckerberg has attempted to poach OpenAI employees with eye-popping compensation packages, which Altman in June said included $100 million signing bonuses.\n\nWhile Altman at the time said that he was happy that \"at least so far, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that,\" Zuckerberg successfully hired away some prominent OpenAI talent.\n\nThe Meta CEO, who even hand-delivered soup to an OpenAI employee he was attempting to poach, hired away ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao and three researchers who helped build OpenAI's Zurich office.",

    "title": "The best Sambas alternatives that are better than the originals",
    "description": "Here are the best Adidas Sambas alternatives to wear this fall, from Puma plimsolls to colorful Golas.",
    "fullText": "It's somehow already been nearly three years since the summer everyone switched from Filas to Sambas. And so far, it looks like the slim sneaker trend is here to stay. I personally find them much more practical than dad shoes, and easy to collect in their colorful shades of suede.\n\nSambas debuted in 1949 and were originally designed for soccer players. These days, the ubiquitous sneakers can be spotted on both the preppy and the punk, thanks to their comfortable, versatile design.\n\nAt the peak of the Sambas hype, I considered investing in a pair myself. But, I didn't want to dress like a carbon copy of everyone else. So I decided to explore similar sporty-chic styles — here are the best alternatives to Adidas Sambas I've found, including a handful worn by our style editors.\n\nFor more of the top trendy sneakers we've tested, see our guide to the best retro sneakers.\n\nWhite sneakers are a staple in my everyday wardrobe, whether I'm wearing a dress or athleisure, so I was excited to try some Gola sneakers. The Vipers are a high-quality leather alternatives to Sambas, which offer a similar suede T-toe and a translucent gum sole. After removing them from the box, I was immediately impressed with their sturdy yet flexible feel. They felt comfortable on the first wear.\n\nAlthough they look equally good with leggings or a sundress, my favorite styling choice for these shoes is to have them peeking out from underneath a pair of wide-leg slacks. They add a sporty touch, yet still manage to look polished. These fit true to size. They look good with various sock lengths, but I found them most comfortable with calf-length socks since the tongue of the shoe rubbed against my ankle a bit when I wore them with short socks.\n\nIf you prefer a bright statement sneaker, consider Alohas' low-top leather style. It's available in dozens of vibrant hues like orange, pink, and lime, alongside neutrals in cream and ivory — and of recently, some fresh new colorways. Exposed stitching, perforated details, and contrast accents up the style factor, while the rubber sole keeps them comfy.\n\nI'll admit, I was first clued into Alo's new Sunset Sneakers because I saw that Kendall Jenner is attached to their debut and felt curious as to why the brand keeps putting out more colorways (they're now up to seven). Even more curious is the yoga apparel brand's new foray into footwear and how it'll compare to Lululemon's attempts.\n\nThese have an edge over Sambas because their raised foam insoles offer better cushioning than a completely flat sneaker. They run small and have a narrow toe box, so the brand recommends ordering a half size up.\n\nNew Balance may have perfected the chunky dad sneaker, but the RC42 showcases the versatility of the brand's design language. This plimsoll mixes suede and leather for a multidimensional look.\n\nReviewers note that these tend to run about a half size small, so round up if you plan to wear these with athletic socks. If you prefer a no-show sock, their padded heel collars and tabs will make them easier to break in blister-free.\n\nThese Pumas offer comfort and style, and they're roomy enough for people with wider feet. The retro-inspired sneakers have a low profile, leather upper, and a rubber sole. Another point to consider: Puma has received the Fair Labor Association accreditation for upholding fair labor standards throughout its supply chains and improving working conditions.\n\nCoolway's Kizuna sneakers are designed in Spain and take clear design notes from the Sambas. However, the suede uppers come in a notable amount of pastel shades, which will complement any light-wash jeans you wear them with. They come in unisex European sizing, so be sure to compare the brand's size guide with your foot measurements.\n\nNaturalizer is one of our favorite sources of comfortable women's dress shoes. Its Medina sneakers stand out because several colorways come in narrow, wide and extra wide sizes, with a contoured footbed and cushioned heel cups. So if you've ever felt too squeezed in or unsupported by Sambas, you now have your solution.\n\nThe Stellas are Larroudé's very first pair of sneakers, and a big departure from the brand's somewhat fanciful design language. The Stellas have a luxury-grade aesthetic, yet are still much more affordable than those from Chloé or Loewe. As a bonus, each pair comes with two sets of laces for a more customizable look.\n\nIf totally flat sneakers are too taxing on your feet, consider Adidas' SL 72 style. They look similar to the Sambas but with a slightly raised heel, which can help reduce pressure and alleviate pain. The textile and leather shoe with a rubber outsole comes in 16 unique colorways, including a patterned burgundy option inspired by ornate carpets.\n\nSeavees' leather-and-suede design with a memory foam footbed is crafted with recycled materials in the sport mesh lining, cotton insole cover, polyester laces, and rubber outsole. A fun detail: The shoe (named after the Bay Area Clippers soccer team from the 1960s) has a grippy bottom with a colorful terrazzo-like design.\n\nThese lightweight leather sneakers with suede accents soften and gain a vintage look with each wear. The rubber gum sole adds traction and a retro look. They're great if you want a subtle pop of color — like a fuchsia Nike logo — without an entirely colorful shoe. Customers report they run a bit narrow, though, so they may not be the best fit for people with wide feet.\n\nDolce Vita generally offers a wide variety of colors and patterns in their shoes, and these suede sneakers are no exception. They come in 20 colorways including an icy blue suede with white accents, a leopard-print calf hair version with sparkling silver details, and a sunny yellow. Customers appreciate that these shoes can be dressed up or down, although they run slightly narrow.\n\nThe organic leather that makes up these stylish kicks is super soft and pliable, although they also come in canvas and suede versions. Additional materials include a bio-based E.V.A. from sugar cane, recycled rubber, and recycled polyester. Whether you prefer a lime green leather pair with lilac contrast or a camel-colored suede with black leather details, these are sure to be the focal point of your outfit.\n\nIf you're need a pair of Sambas alternatives to feature in your next vacation post, try packing these as your lightweight, wear-anywhere sneakers. \n\n\"The Essex sneakers are like a cool, more obscure version of the Nike Cortezes. I keep them by my doorway so I can slip them on anytime I walk to the bodega. They're so comfy and light, and they go with everything,\" writes senior associate style editor Gabrielle Chase. \"The insides are so plush that I can even wear them without socks. I also love their tube laces — it's a little detail that makes them a bit more unique.\"\n\nThey have a similar fit to ballet flats, with a slim footbed and tapered toe box. Even better, they're made with recycled materials featured in their durable rubber outsoles and silky soft Tencel-based lining.\n\nThese are probably my most-worn sneakers, and this is coming from someone with a closet that's practically brimming with them. I love that the Charlies carry the aesthetic impact of a pair of Sambas or Gazelles, but also have a quiet luxury thing about them. While folks with a high arch may want to add a pair of inserts to these, I find them to be pretty comfortable as-is for walking around all day. They do take a solid three to five wears to break in, but once you've gotten the leather to mold to your feet a little, you'll never want to take these off. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor\n\nThe classic shoe (beloved for its pliable leather and thin, bendable sole that's great for athletes) was recently reinvented with an upgraded design. The new Mexico 66 SD features a refined and more comfortable silhouette while delivering the same sporty-chic style as its predecessor, the Mexico 66. Choose from 14 colorful and muted hues.\n\nA quilted design elevates these leather kicks, available in five colorways including a metallic silver. The Breakaways offer lots of comfort, too, thanks to a cushy, supportive footbed. If you have a wide foot, consider sizing up for a more comfortable fit.\n\nBeckett Simonon shoes are made-to-order, eliminating unsold inventory. The brand also takes pride in creating a favorable work environment for its employees and using the highest quality leather.\n\nThe Morgen Trainers feature a full-grain leather outer with water-repellent suede detailing. Their Vachetta leather lining is temperature-regulating, moisture-absorbing, odor-controlling, and breathable to keep feet feeling fresh and comfortable. The rubber sole is strong yet flexible and water-resistant.\n\nA velcro closure helps differentiate these sneaks from Sambas and makes putting them on effortless. The gummy Talia sneakers are crafted from leather and synthetic materials with a rounded toe and contrast detailing. Customers report a comfortable fit, a soft terry-cloth fabric interior, and true sizing.\n\nRecognizable by the signature blue stitching on the heel, Rothy's sustainable footwear utilizes a knit material that's crafted from recycled plastic water bottles. Plus, the insoles contain recycled foam, the rubber soles are carbon-free, the adhesives are non-toxic and vegan, and the brand uses biodegradable post-consumer recycled materials for its packaging. When I tested the brand's Lace Up Sneaker, I was impressed by the super comfortable knit fabric with no break-in period. They run a little narrow so I recommend sizing up in the cushy kicks.\n\nRead \n\nIf you're looking for a budget-friendly alternative to Adidas Sambas, these 100% synthetic shoes are less than half the price. The Casual Low Top Sneakers come in nine colors, including metallic gold and a two-tone wine red. Amazon customers say the soles are well-made and the shoes feel comfortable and cushioned.\n\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\n\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.

    "description": "Two Trinidadian nationals were said to be among six people killed by a US strike. The lawsuit characterized the strike as 'unlawful.'",
    "fullText": "The US armed forces have for months been carrying out lethal strikes against vessels it says were engaged in drug smuggling in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. Now, the families of two men killed in one of those strikes are suing the US government for damages.\n\nTwo family members of Trinidadian nationals said to have been killed in a US boat strike in the Caribbean have accused the federal government of engaging in \"unlawful\" activity.\n\nThis case appears to mark the first wrongful-death lawsuit filed in federal court against the Trump administration in response to the strikes. Since September, the US has killed more than 100 people in this campaign.\n\nThe lawsuit identified two men, Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo, as having been among the six people killed on October 14, 2025. The lawsuit said that a US missile struck their vessel while it was sailing from Venezuela to Trinidad. Joseph and Samaroo were returning home after fishing in waters off the Venezuelan coast and working on farms in the country, the complaint said.\n\nJoseph, 26 at the time of his death, lived in Las Cuevas, Trinidad, per the lawsuit. The filing says that he had tried to return to Trinidad earlier in the summer but was unable to travel after the boat he planned to take experienced engine trouble. He later secured another ride home in October.\n\nSamaroo, 41 at the time of his death and also a resident of Las Cuevas, had been working on a farm in Venezuela after his early release on parole, according to the lawsuit, which says he had previously served 15 years in prison for a homicide conviction.\n\nThe attack on the boat \"was part of an unprecedented and manifestly unlawful US military campaign,\" the suit, filed in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts, added, calling them \"premeditated and intentional killings\" that \"lack any plausible legal justification.\" It argued there's no situation in which such action would have been acceptable.\n\nAt the time of the boat strike, President Donald Trump characterized the six men as \"narcoterrorists\" and said the boat was \"associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks\" and was involved in the trafficking of narcotics along a known route.\n\nThe lawsuit rejected these claims, saying Joseph and Samaroo weren't members of or affiliated with drug cartels. The filing further stated that the Trinidadian government has \"no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities.\"\n\nJoseph's mother, Lenore Burnley, and Samaroo's sister, Sallycar Korasingh, are named as the plaintiffs in this new lawsuit. The filing invokes the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute, federal laws that allow families to pursue wrongful-death claims arising in international waters and, in some cases, allege violations of international law in US courts.\n\n\"These premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification,\" the lawsuit said. \"Thus they were simply murders, ordered by individuals at the highest levels of government and obeyed by military officers in the chain of command.\"\n\nThe White House told Business Insider in a request for comment that \"The October 14 strike was conducted against narcoterrorists,\" and that Trump \"used his lawful authority to take decisive action against the scourge of illicit narcotics\" coming into the US. The Department of Defense said it does not comment on ongoing litigation as a matter of policy.\n\nLawmakers, officials, and experts across fields have debated the legality of the US campaign since it began in September. The Trump administration has justified its attacks, saying the targets are people and vessels bringing drugs into the US.\n\nLegal experts, though, have said that the strikes don't follow the proper protocols for interdicting alleged drug trafficking vessels and have questionable legal backing. Lethal action is not the norm for US counter-narcotics operations. Multiple reports on these operations aimed at stemming the flow of drugs into the US have raised concerns about the violation of the laws of armed conflict.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk is going scorched-earth with Vinod Khosla after the billionaire VC founder accused the Tesla CEO of promoting racism and made an open call to Musk's employees to quit.\n\nOn Monday evening, Khosla said on X that Musk frames racism as a \"great and desirable paradigm,\" responding to a September post from the CEO in which Musk said \"white people are a rapidly diminishing minority of global population.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO has promoted posts in the past regarding changing demographics around the white population.\n\nIn his post, Khosla called on employees at Musk's companies to ditch their employers and join Khosla Ventures' portfolio, which includes AI startups such as OpenAI and Replit.\n\n\"All non-whites in @tesla, @SpaceX @X etc and all decent whites should quit and join our portfolio,\" Khosla, an Indian-American who immigrated to the US in the 1970s, wrote. \"Email us your linkedin!\"\n\nMusk fired insults at Khosla in response, calling the VC a \"pompous asshole\" and a slur for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\n\"Vinod, you're not just such a pompous asshole that you tried to stop the public from using a public beach near your house…\" Musk wrote. \"My partner, Shivon, is half Indian and my eldest son with her is named in honor of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.\"\n\nMusk appeared to be referring to Khosla's yearslong attempt to block public access to a beach near the VC's home on the Peninsula coast in San Mateo County. Khosla has fought for years against public access to Martins Beach, which runs through his $37 million estate, and has filed multiple lawsuits over the issue.\n\nKhosla and Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe two billionaires have clashed before. In 2024, Khosla declined to endorse President Donald Trump after Musk urged the VC to vote for a Trump-Vance ticket. The VC has also called Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI \"a bit of sour grapes.\"\n\nKhosla's most recent comment on Musk came just hours after he spoke out against the ICE shooting in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration,\" Khosla wrote. \"The video was sickening to watch and the storytelling without facts or with invented fictitious facts by authorities almost unimaginable in a civilized society.\"\n\nThe VC founder was just one of many business and tech leaders who spoke out on social media to denounce the ICE shooting.",

    "description": "Former high-end real estate brokers, Tal and Oren, are accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women with their brother, Alon Alexander.",
    "fullText": "Are Tal and Oren Alexander — once among the nation's top luxury real estate brokers — serial predators who, together with a third brother, drugged and sexually assaulted dozens of women and girls over more than a decade?\n\nOr are they simply womanizers whose party-fueled lifestyle involved lots of consensual sex?\n\nThat's a pivotal question a six-man, six-woman jury will have to consider over the course of Tal, Oren, and Oren's twin, Alon Alexander's sex-trafficking trial that's unfolding over the next several weeks in a Manhattan federal courtroom.\n\nOpening arguments in the criminal case began on January 27, with the Alexanders' defense team and the US government presenting dramatically different, dueling portrayals of the sibling trio.\n\nA conviction could send Tal Alexander, 39, and his 38-year-old twin brothers to prison for life and mark an extraordinary downfall for the real estate agent siblings whose high-profile clients included Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, financier Leon Black, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nHere are some of the most striking moments from the Alexander brothers' trial so far:\n\nAn accuser using the pseudonym \"Katie Moore,\" who was the first government witness to testify, broke down in tears as she told the jury she was drugged and raped by Alon Alexander in 2012 when she was 20 years old.\n\nMoore said that she woke up naked with Alon Alexander standing over her, also naked, at the Manhattan apartment he shared with Tal Alexander, in the hours after an NBA Finals viewing party at the nearby penthouse of actor Zac Efron.\n\n\"I was shocked, and I had no idea how I got there,\" Moore testified, adding that she tried two or three times to get out of the bed, but \"Alon kept pushing me back down.\"\n\n\"I don't want to have sex with you!\" she recalled telling Alon Alexander, who she said laughed and told her, \"But you already did.\"\n\nHe continued to assault her as she desperately screamed out \"no\" over and over, Moore said.\n\nAt some point, Moore testified, Tal Alexander walked in, and as the two brothers were talking, Alon Alexander \"was raping\" her.\n\nShe said she left while Alon Alexander was asleep. Within hours, she discovered she was bruised on the right side of her body, including \"a hand print.\"\n\nDuring opening statements, Assistant US Attorney Madison Reddick Smyser told the jury that the Alexander brothers \"celebrated their crimes.\"\n\n\"For example,\" the prosecutor said, \"after Oren and Alon sexually assaulted three high school girls in a hotel room, Oren texted a friend that he took down a 17-year-old.\"\n\nSmyser said the Alexander brothers used \"power, wealth, and access to lure women and girls to them\" at upscale locales like the Hamptons, Miami, and Manhattan.\n\nSmyser, the Manhattan federal prosecutor, told jurors that the Alexander brothers texted each other about their conquests, at one point saying that \"the only thing that could bring them down is if some 'hoe' complained.\"\n\nThe prosecutor said the Alexander brothers \"used whatever means necessary\" — including drugging victims and using \"brute force\" — to carry out sex attacks.\n\nThey \"carried out their rapes in different ways,\" said Smyser. \"They physically held victims down\" and put drugs like GHB and Xanax in their drinks, getting the women so intoxicated that, in one instance, their victim could not stand up, she said.",

    "description": "Paramount+ snagged about a million new customers on the day of its first UFC event, an exec told employees, as close to 5 million viewers tuned in.",
    "fullText": "UFC is already a hit for Paramount+.\n\nParamount's flagship streaming service generated about a million new subscribers on the day of its first-ever UFC event, Paramount product chief Dane Glasgow told employees in a town hall on Tuesday morning, three staffers who attended the meeting told Business Insider.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson said: \"Those numbers are unverified, and it's against our policy to share speculative data externally.\"\n\nIn August, Paramount did a deal with UFC parent TKO that will see it pay $7.7 billion to secure UFC rights in the US for seven years.\n\nGlasgow said at the town hall that Saturday was the second-largest day of sign-ups ever for its streamer, and that UFC 324 was the second-most-streamed sporting event on the service, according to two employees.\n\nNotably, Paramount made its UFC matches available for anyone with a Paramount+ subscription, which starts at $8.99 a month. Before the Paramount deal, many UFC matches were only on pay-per-view for around $80 each.\n\nParamount previously announced that its UFC broadcast had just under 5 million average viewers for the main card. Paramount CEO David Ellison told staffers in an email that it was \"the largest-ever exclusive live event for Paramount+.\" The streamer has drawn larger audiences to other non-exclusive live events, including NFL games that ran on both Paramount+ and CBS.\n\n\"This record-breaking performance is, above all, a testament to the extraordinary teamwork across our entire company,\" Ellison told employees in his memo, which was obtained by Business Insider.\n\nFor context, Netflix's Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight added about 1.4 million US subscribers to that service in November 2024, according to the subscription data firm Antenna. The firm only tracks US data.\n\nAntenna estimated that Paramount+ reeled in an estimated 3.2 million new US customers when it hosted the Super Bowl in 2024.\n\nRead Ellison's full memo to employees below:\n\nA huge congratulations to everyone who contributed to the success of our first UFC event on Paramount+! Several members of our leadership team and I were cageside Saturday night, and we were completely blown away by the experience and by the intensity, skill and heart on display across the card. We left the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas more excited and energized than ever about our partnership with Dana White and the entire TKO/UFC team.\n\nI've heard from several executives at TKO/UFC, and they also could not be more pleased with how everything came together. It was a fantastic start to our 7-year partnership!\n\nWhile we went into the weekend with high expectations, I'm thrilled to share that we exceeded them, reaching nearly 5 million streaming views — the largest-ever exclusive live event for Paramount+. And the actual audience was likely even higher, given how common co-viewing is among UFC fans.\n\nThis record-breaking performance is, above all, a testament to the extraordinary teamwork across our entire company. Every single business unit, division and team — from Paramount+, Paramount Pictures and CBS to MTV, BET, Nickelodeon and Pluto, as well as Marketing, Social, Ad Sales, Technology, Events and more — came together, rolled up their sleeves and got creative. The incredible power of Paramount One to reach the broadest possible audience was on full display companywide, and UFC 324 stands as our strongest example yet of what we can achieve when we all work together toward a common goal.\n\nAgain, hats off to everyone. With nearly 5 million streaming views and record-breaking engagement, UFC 324 set the bar high, and we can't wait to keep the momentum going at UFC 325 next weekend in Sydney!",

    "description": "Make your picture look better, reduce buffering, and keep your apps running smoothly.",
    "fullText": "Whether you're a smart TV veteran or are somehow just now setting your first TV with an internet connection, there's a lot to learn. Modern TVs are basically computers, complete with their own operating systems and application ecosystems. That means you can tweak them to run better.—or just the way you want them to. Here are a few tips, tricks, and hacks that every smart TV owner should be aware of.\n\nWondering why every single TV show and movie you watch on your brand new TV looks like a soap opera or a cheap community theater production? It's probably because of motion smoothing.\n\nThis \"feature\", which is the default on far too many TVs, artificially ups the frame rate from either 24 or 30 frames per second to 60 or 120 frames, or even higher. This effect can bring a real immediacy to live events like sports, but it's not great for regular old TV shows. Because where does the TV get those extra frames from? It makes them up, often creating an uncanny blurring effect reminiscent of old school videotape. I recommend turning this feature off basically the minute you set up your TV, and our friends at PCMag have a guide to disabling the feature covering all the major smart TV platforms.\n\nStreaming 4k takes up a lot of bandwidth. Modern wifi routers can usually handle without much of an issue, especially if your TV is close to your router. Even so, it's a good idea to physically connect your smart TV to your network with an ethernet cable if you have the option.\n\nThere's a couple of reasons to do this. One, wired connections are more stable, mostly because they're not vulnerable to interference from neighboring wireless networks and other devices, so you'll be far less like to suffer through stuttering images or audio dropouts. Two, connecting your TV via ethernet frees up the wireless spectrum for all of your other devices, which is important if you live in a house with other internet users (not to mention other smart devices).\n\nSmart TVs tend to come pre-loaded with any number of apps, all of them prominently placed on the home screen. You can, and should, move the apps you actually use to the top instead. How to do this will vary depending on your operating system, but it generally means pressing and holding on the app you want was at the top of the list and then moving it around. Failing that, you may need to do some digging in the settings.\n\nTired of all the ads showing up on your TV? You might be able to block them using your router. Lifehacker has a guide to blocking ads on Samsung, LG, and Roku smart TVs that explains how to change your internet settings so that your TV can't access the ads in the interface anymore.\n\nSmart TVs are basically computers, meaning they need to boot up when you turn them on. Most users don't want to wait every time they turn on the TV though, which is why smart TVs don't actually turn off—they suspend their functions, the same way your phone or laptop does. That's fine if you use your TV constantly, but a real waste of electricity for a TV that you only turn on occasionally. And shutting down your set completely could have another benefit: reducing bugginess. To reiterate, a smart TV is basically a computer, and every computer user knows that restarting your computer can fix random problems.\n\nSome TVs allow you to disable this feature—just look for a \"quick start\" option in the settings. Others, including Sony, suggest that you unplug TVs you won't be using for months at a time in order to shut them down completely.\n\nStreaming television is great, but don't overlook traditional broadcast TV. Most major cultural events, from the Super Bowl, to the Oscars, to the World Series, are still free to watch on network TV, as are of the most popular shows. If you live in a major city, or even just close to one, there's a good chance you can watch network TV free of charge using nothing more than a small TV antenna. This can mean free access to stations like NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and PBS—no need to pay for cable or a pricey \"live tv\" streaming subscription. All you need to do is plug in an antenna, scan for channels, and you're good to go. (Lifehacker has a guide to the best digital TV antennas to help you get started.)\n\nNot to keep harping on this point, but a smart TV is a computer, and like a computer, it can build up all sorts of junk in its memory over time. If your smart TV is suddenly moving more slowly than you remember, or even crashing, it might be time to clear out its various caches. Get started with this guide to clearing the cache on every major smart TV brand.\n\nYour smart TV is a potential security risk. It's a computer, like any other, and that means you need to keep it up to date, secure all accounts connected to it, and be mindful of any built-in microphones and cameras. Check out our guide to securing your smart TV for more on these tips and more.\n\nI've written about why smart TVs are so cheap, and it turns out a big part of it is automatic content recognition, or ACR. Most brands of smart TVs are constantly monitoring what you're watching and using that to build a profile with your viewing habits that can be sold to third parties, a practice that nets the TV manufacturers are lot of money. If this concerns you, consider turning the feature off to protect your privacy. Lifehacker has a guide to disabling ACR on the major smart TV platforms.\n\nIf you want your smart TV to have an entirely different look and feel, you may be able to install a different launcher, which will give you much more control. Google TV users, for example, can install Projectivy to completely replace the default launcher. This won't be an option for every model of smart TV, but it's worth considering if you're feeling stuck with the software that came preinstalled.",

    "description": "Apple just issued an update for an iPhone that's over 12 years old.",
    "fullText": "Many of us choose to upgrade our smartphones every two or three years, while others pick up the latest model every year. But just because it's the norm to swap out your smartphone on a regular basis, that doesn't mean all of us do. Smartphones can last a long time, especially if you maintain it with the occasional battery replacement.\n\nBut no piece of technology lasts forever. Eventually, something gives out—even if it's just the company that makes it. Even Apple, which usually offers its iPhones a number of years of updates after their original release, drops support for new features after some time. That's why your iPhone XS can't run iOS 26: Apple drew the line here this year. But iPhones like the XS can still receive updates, even if they aren't the latest and greatest version of iOS. Instead, Apple tends to issue security and stability patches to older iPhones, to ensure the users who still rely on them can do so safely and securely. It might be in Apple's best financial interest to persuade you to buy a new iPhone, but not at the cost of putting a large number of users at risk of cyber attacks.\n\nApple dropped new updates for an assortment of devices on Monday. That includes its latest devices, of course, which can now install iOS 26.2.1. But a host of older devices also received new updates, some of which are particularly surprising, considering their age.\n\nApple released iOS 18.7.4 for iPhones that either can't or won't update to iOS 26. In the former category, that basically includes the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. Then, there's iOS 16.7.13, for iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and X, and iOS 15.8.6, for iPhone 6S, iPhone 7, and iPhone SE (first-gen). Those are some old iPhones, but that's not what caught my eye today. In a twist, Apple dropped an update for iPhones running iOS 12, including iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones can now run iOS 12.5.8. For reference, Apple released iOS 12 back in 2018, so it's pretty wild to see a new version in 2026.\n\nThese iPhones are even older. The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus dropped all the way back in 2014, while the iPhone 5S released the year before that. As such, Apple just sent an update to 12-year-old iPhone. If you're still rocking one of these devices, that new update must be quite the surprise. It's even more than the age of the devices itself: Apple considers all three of these iPhones \"obsolete,\" as the company stopped selling them more than seven years ago. The company will not service the hardware for obsolete products, and largely omits them from future software releases. That's why this is so interesting.\n\niOS 12.5.8 is, of course, not a feature update, but it's also not a security update, either. Instead, Apple extended the certificate required for features like iMessage, FaceTime, and device activation to continue working after January of next year. These iPhones might not have seen a new feature in years, but they'll still be able to FaceTime in a year's time—and that's pretty great.\n\nIt's not clear how many people are using these iPhones in 2026. But if you do, and it's working for you, Apple gave you one more reason to keep your phone for another year.",

    "description": "Venezuelans are circumventing the government’s expanded crackdown on dissent by speaking in code, not mentioning political leaders, constantly deleting content from their phones and refusing to express opinions in WhatsApp groups.",
    "fullText": "“Delete your conversations before going out.”\n\nThese recent WhatsApp messages of a Venezuelan family – who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals – underscore the caution civilians are taking in their daily conversations, on social media and in text messages as the government expands its crackdown on dissenting speech.\n\nReports of authorities searching civilians’ phones for political content critical of the government have increased since officials declared a state of emergency in response to the US attack in Caracas, which led to the capture of President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAuthorities have set up more checkpoints along the streets of the capital and other parts of the country, claiming they’re necessary to reinforce national security amid political tension. Some are stationary, usually near security zones or public institutions, but others are mobile. Officers stop drivers, ask where they are going, search the vehicles, and often go through their cell phones.\n\nAlthough phone searches are nothing new, testimonies gathered by CNN show that these measures have increased since the government’s emergency decree after the January 3 US attack.\n\nThe decree enables authorities to adopt extraordinary measures, but it does not detail the scope, the criteria, or whether it limits the rights and freedoms of citizens such as the protection of privacy in communications.\n\nOn the other hand, article 48 of Venezuela’s constitution explicitly states: “The secrecy and inviolability of private communications in all their forms is guaranteed. They may not be interfered with except by order of a competent court, in accordance with legal provisions, and preserving the secrecy of any private matters not related to the corresponding legal process.”\n\nNevertheless, CNN has spoken with several Venezuelans who have had their phones searched in recent weeks. Because of this, many speak in code, avoid mentioning political leaders, constantly delete content from their phones and refuse to express opinions in WhatsApp groups.\n\nSince Maduro’s capture by the US, daily life for ordinary Venezuelans has become full of uncertainty.\n\nExactly who is in charge of the country is unclear. While US President Donald Trump has claimed to be “running” Venezuela, Maduro’s former deputy – the now acting president Delcy Rodríguez – has pushed back, saying on Sunday that she’d had “enough” of US orders.\n\nStill, there is no sign yet that she plans an election that would legitimize her rule. Meanwhile, the economy remains in crisis and the prices of basic products fluctuate daily.\n\nThe one thing that is certain, for anybody who might be perceived as a critic of the government, is the need to take precautions when going out in the street.\n\n“This afternoon we received a statement from the neighborhood community council, and they recommended we be careful with what we say on WhatsApp and in writing,” reads one of the group messages seen by CNN.\n\nAnother message is from a family member who is outside the country and mentions their desire to go to Venezuela. A relative responds that it is better not to because “right now things are complicated.”\n\nIn response to the insistence of another family member who says they will travel anyway, they suggest deleting social media accounts and creating a new Google account. According to what CNN was able to verify, cell phones of people entering the country are also checked when they arrive at the airport.\n\nAt the request of their loved ones, families in other countries have told CNN that they, too, avoid political conversations and use code words on their phones to communicate with relatives in Venezuela.\n\nEven before Maduro’s fall, routine checkpoints could become nightmares for civilians.\n\nThis is what a cook experienced in April of last year. The cook, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said that when he left his house on his way to work that day, an agent of the SEBIN intelligence service forced him to stop just after a bridge in western Caracas. They did not ask for papers or his ID card.\n\nThe first question was about his job. “Head chef,” he answered. The second question went straight to politics. “Are you a guarimbero?,” they asked, using a term the government coined to pejoratively refer to anti-government protesters. He replied that he was a cook and insisted that he worked as a head chef.\n\nHe even told the agent that he had recently become a father and just wanted to go to work and get home soon to see his newborn daughter. But instead of letting him go, they told him that they would check his car and cell phone.\n\nAfter authorities asked him to unlock his phone, they typed keywords in the chat search such as guarimba – or street protest – and names like Diosdado Cabello (Venezuela’s interior minister) and Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThe cook told CNN that several of his friends had gone through similar situations, so he made a habit of reading and deleting any political content, although somewhere in his photo gallery he kept a picture with the opposition leader María Corina Machado. When they typed Maduro in the WhatsApp search, only recipes with plantains or ripe tomatoes appeared (maduro means ripe in English). And in the photo gallery, they only found pictures of dishes and his daughter.\n\nThe thorough search lasted about an hour “between intimidating messages and the same suspicious questions,” he recalls. During the vehicle inspection, one of the officers showed an interest in a motorcycle accessory he had in his truck. “Keep it. I don’t even have a motorcycle anymore,” the cook said, trying to end the situation with a gesture. Immediately after that, they gave him the signal to go on his way.\n\nAs he took off, he looked in the rearview mirror and saw other cars lined up waiting to be searched. Still, with a mix of fear and resignation, he drove away.\n\nThe experience affected him to the point that he now avoids political conversations entirely. Today, he says that if he receives a message on that topic, he asks to change the subject, deletes the texts and immediately empties the chat. He avoids going out alone, especially at night, because he says the number of checkpoints has increased. He also believes having tattoos draws more attention from officers. He says he has already been searched three times in less than six months.\n\nA journalist experienced a similar situation in December. In broad daylight and after sharing a coffee with colleagues, the journalist, who prefers not to be identified for fear of reprisals, was traveling down the Country Club route heading to El Bosque, in eastern Caracas, when he came across a police checkpoint that was stopping all the cars passing through the area, he said. This is the route the reporter usually takes when using “green paths,” or alternative ways to avoid traffic.\n\nThe procedure began with the usual requests: papers, ID and driver’s license. But then, they focused their attention on his wallet, he says. He recounts that when he opened it, a small, folded paper fell out, and he immediately felt the atmosphere change. The officers argued that they suspected he possessed marijuana, so they decided to do a more thorough inspection.\n\nThe tension increased. The officer asked for his phone and began to check it, also looking for keywords in his chats, traces of drug use, or anything that could implicate wrongdoing. The journalist says he did not have marijuana or any other drug in the car.\n\nFortunately, he says, the officers did not identify his profession and in their search did not include politically charged words that could have exposed conversations with his bosses, sources or colleagues. But he felt that fear throughout the search, which lasted almost an hour, leaving him extremely nervous and desperate to get out of the situation as soon as possible. He knew the episode was over when he heard the phrase: “Well, whatever you want to contribute.” He handed over a $50 bill from his wallet before continuing home.\n\nThe episode still affects his daily decisions. He has left several WhatsApp groups and frequently deletes content from his phone. He now avoids going out at night and limits his outings even during the day, leaving the house only when necessary.\n\nBoth men say they were surprised by the checkpoint, but not by the situation, given how increasingly frequent these measures have become.\n\nMany civilians have taken to social media to report phone inspections, which sometimes lead to intimidation, extortion and even detention. Many claims are made by men, who say authorities often demand payments in exchange for allowing drivers to continue. Security forces also search women, even in the presence of children. All testimonies agree that agents are looking for political content, especially for terms such as “invasion” or “Trump” and “Maduro.” But during the searches, personal and even intimate content has also been exposed, leading to complaints that the practice violates constitutional protections of private life.\n\nCNN has reached out to the interior ministry, which oversees most of these checkpoints, but has not yet received a response.\n\nWhen asked about the issue by a journalist, Maracaibo Mayor Giancarlo Di Martino said on January 17 that cellphone inspections were “completely prohibited, so any officer who abuses their authority must be reported.”\n\nSome people are not clear about their individual rights, including the right to privacy. Others know them, but fear being detained if they try to exercise them.\n\nThe non-governmental organization Espacio Público has shared recommendations on social media for those who encounter inspections: ask the officer to show necessary court orders that would allow a search, take note of the agent’s name and the entity they belong to in case there is no court order, and – if possible – try to have at least two witnesses and keep phone data encrypted, among other things.",

    "fullText": "The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group is now in the Indian Ocean, putting it closer to assist in any potential US operations targeting Iran, two sources told CNN.\n\nThe group is within the area of responsibility of US Central Command, whose purview includes military operations in the Middle East.\n\nStill, the carrier is not necessarily in a final position for any potential operation. President Donald Trump continues to consider options for striking Iran, but there is no indication any decision has been made.\n\nA carrier strike group normally includes an aircraft carrier, guided missile cruisers, anti-aircraft warships and anti-submarine destroyers or frigates.\n\nCNN has previously reported the carrier was en route to the region.\n\nAllies have been urging the US to forestall any military action.\n\nIn Iran, the death toll from the government’s crackdown on protesters continues to climb. On Sunday, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported that 5,520 protesters have been killed since demonstrations started late last month. It said that an additional 17,091 deaths were still being reviewed.\n\nTrump has warned Iran against killing protesters, repeatedly threatening to intervene in the country if it does so. Last week, however, he said that Iran “wants to talk,” suggesting that the US may enter discussions with Tehran.\n\nOn Monday, the administration reiterated it is open to having discussions with the Iranian regime as long as “they know what the terms are,” a US official said.\n\n“We are open for business … as they say, so if they want to contact us and they know what the terms are, then we’re going to have the conversation,” the official said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Islamic Republic is bracing for a potential US attack. In Tehran, a large mural was unveiled in Revolution Square on Sunday depicting a swarm of jet fighters flying over a warship bearing the US flag.\n\nDuring Friday prayers in the capital, the imam leading the sermon warned the US against launching any attacks.\n\n“The trillion dollars you invested in the region are under the watch of our missiles,” Mohammad Ali Akbari said.\n\nIran has been escalating its rhetoric against the US over the past week, warning that any attack would be met with force capable of destabilizing the entire Middle East.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei told journalists Monday that Tehran is “more than capable” of responding to any aggression from the US with a “regretful” response.\n\n“The arrival of one or several warships does not impact Iran’s defensive determination,” he said. “Our armed forces are monitoring every development and are not wasting a single second to enhance their capabilities.”\n\nOn Saturday, the Iranian military said its missile capabilities and efficiency have increased significantly since the 12-day war with Israel in June. Iran launched multiple waves of missile and drone attacks at Israeli targets during that conflict, which started after Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran last year, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists. The United States later joined, targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\nIran possesses a large arsenal of medium- and long-range ballistic missiles, several types of which were fired at Israel during the conflict. Its drones, a pillar of its military power, have also been deployed beyond its borders, including in Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nMaj. Gen. Ali Abdollahi, the commander of Iran’s Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, a key military operational command, said last week that any aggression against his country “will immediately turn all American interests, bases and centers of influence into legitimate, definite and accessible targets” for Iran.\n\nIranian officials have also warned that a US attack would lead to strikes on Washington’s allies in the region. US-allied Arab nations in the Persian Gulf have lobbied Trump against a strike, according to regional officials speaking to CNN this month.\n\nIran also has a network of regional proxies that could potentially be mobilized in the event of a strike. While some of its surrogates, such as Hezbollah, have been significantly weakened by Israel over the past two years, others remain heavily armed.\n\nOn Sunday, Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi, the commander of Kataeb Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq, called on Iran’s loyalists “across the globe … to prepare for all-out war in support of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”\n\n“We tell the enemies, the war against the (Islamic) Republic, will not be a walk in the park,” he said.\n\nCNN’s Nadeen Ebrahim and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

    "description": "Computers still don’t do well with vagueness and uncertainty.",
    "fullText": "In college I took a medieval studies seminar on the origins of British common law. There I learned how chancery judges in 14th-century England decided property disputes by applying their own reasoning when testimonies conflicted and records were unclear or incomplete. It was a formative class for me and one whose lessons I return to often. It has remained critical in my work advising companies, even though it didn’t contain a single number, management principle or economic theory.\n\nArtificial intelligence is poised to profoundly affect American business, and executives are rethinking the skills they seek in colleagues and advisers. For my part, I’m reminded of the value of an education deep in reading, research and analysis — one that teaches how to approach problems with no definitive answers.\n\nMy college education taught me how to think, not what to think. That is what proves most useful when navigating strategic and financial decisions in a technology-driven world. Today, A.I. is near the center of every boardroom discussion I witness. Roughly half the S&P 500 companies mentioned A.I. on their most recent earnings calls, and they speak of the new technology as a force that no serious institution can ignore.\n\nThere is little doubt A.I. will be transformative. And yet, for all the disruption it promises, I am struck by how much will remain unchanged. The most consequential decisions in business have never been about processing information faster or detecting patterns more efficiently. The most salient concerns are questions such as what kind of enterprise a firm should aspire to be, what culture it should embrace, what risks it should tolerate and how its leaders can plan when the path forward is unclear. These are questions of judgment, and judgment cannot be automated — at least not any time soon.\n\nWhat do I mean by “judgment”? The capacity to arbitrate among competing values and differences of opinion, to weigh considerations that matter independently but cannot be satisfied all at once, to consider several paths of action to alight on the best one. Judgment is the faculty we rely on when trade-offs are unavoidable and the right answer is not waiting to be computed. It is a uniquely human skill.\n\nNot long ago, a client was seeking to sell a portion of its business to raise capital. The company faced a choice: offload a high-growth unit that was volatile and not central to the business or a slower-growth unit that better aligned with the company’s mission. An A.I.-assisted analysis recommended selling the slow-growing business, which made sense in purely mathematical terms. But judgment dictated the other path: Sell the volatile unit and improve the other one. Even though it’s too soon to know which path will be correct, I was struck by the certainty of A.I.’s answer.\n\nA.I. excels at pattern recognition, code generation and the synthesis of large volumes of text and data. But someone still has to decide whether an analysis is trustworthy, what implications it carries and whether acting on it would be wise. Someone has to connect the output of a model to the broader context, such as the political environment, the regulatory landscape and the human dynamics at play.\n\nLast year a board wanted to know how much it should offer for a business it wanted to buy. We fed a huge amount of data into an A.I. model, which suggested a valuation that seemed low to me. The chief executives of the two companies had a fraught relationship, and we debated whether the deal price would need to be higher. Sure enough, when the company offered the A.I.-recommended price, it was rejected. The higher price was later accepted and the transaction secured. The model could not account for the interpersonal dynamics. Judgment could.\n\nThis is why I doubt that A.I. will soon match human cognition or that the defining skills of the next generation of professionals will be narrowly technological. Technical fluency matters, of course. But in a world of abundant machine intelligence, the most durable advantage will be broad intellectual range.\n\nThere is a tendency in higher education and in business to push people toward specialization. A.I. accelerates that pressure. If a machine can do the general work, the conventional wisdom goes, humans should retreat to the specific. I believe the opposite. As routine analysis becomes automated, what distinguishes professionals is the ability to synthesize across domains, to see patterns that specialists miss, to exercise judgment.\n\nToday, when hiring, leaders I know look for what might be called a generalist with judgment, someone analytical and adaptable who is nimble enough to learn skills and become reasonably conversant in new knowledge. The best candidates share a quality no machine can replicate. They think independently, navigate ambiguity without waiting for instruction, analyze the questions that were not asked but should have been and own their decisions. They use A.I. — as a tool but not a crutch.\n\nThat medieval law seminar of long ago helped prepare me for this world more than my courses in finance and economics. Just as centuries ago those judges rendered decisions amid reasonable disagreement, where evidence was mixed and incomplete, professionals today must possess the skills to make things better where machines cannot.\n\nBlair Effron is a co-founder of Centerview Partners, an investment bank.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "description": "If so, you're better off buying a first-gen AirTag.",
    "fullText": "On Monday, Apple released a new AirTag—but you wouldn't know that from looking at it. The new AirTag is visibly identical to the old one, despite dropping nearly five years later. But the point of this refresh wasn't to introduce a new design, or even a remarkably improved tracker. Instead, Apple added a couple subtle upgrades that benefit new buyers, without displacing existing AirTag users.\n\nThere are two key improvements here: The first impacts Precision Finding, Apple's system to guide you to lost items. Your device uses its ultra wideband (UWB) chip to give you detailed directions to the location of your AirTag, including haptics, visual, and auditory cues. The second-gen AirTags have a newer UWB chip, which boosts Precision Finding by 50%. That means your new AirTag can be as much as 1.5 times farther away than your old AirTag while still showing up in Precision Finding. Those improvements carry over to the speaker, as well. The new AirTag's speaker is 50% louder than the original model, which could help you hear your missing tracker better, especially if it's buried somewhere like a couch cushion.\n\nThe main thing that didn't change was the most important part: the price. One AirTag is still $29, while a four-pack is still $99. But before you go out an buy one (or four), you should know that your iPhone might not be able to take advantage of these new perks. If so, you'd be better off spending your money on the first-gen AirTag.\n\nAs noted by Techradar, the new AirTag actually requires iPhones and iPads to be running iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 before they can connect. That immediately eliminates any iPhones and iPads that do not support these latest updates, of course (generally any iPhones older than the iPhone 11) but it also presents a challenge to anyone who has simply been holding off from installing iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. If you want to use these newest AirTags, you'll need to update. If you don't want to update, stick with the OG AirTags.\n\nEven if your iPhone is running iOS 26, it might not work with one of the new AirTag's big features. In order to take advantage of that 50% improved Precision Finding, you need an iPhone 15 or newer. That's because these iPhones also come with Apple's newest UWB chip, which is necessary for that upgraded location feature. (The iPhone 16e unfortunately does not have this new UWB chip.)\n\nIf you have an iPhone 14 or older running iOS 26, you'll still be able to use Precision Finding with the new AirTag, but it'll be the standard Precision Finding experience you had with the original. (Apple Watches can also take advantage of this standard Precision Finding, so long as you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later, running watchOS 26.2.1.)\n\nApple doesn't sell the first-generation AirTag anymore, but that's not an issue. If you don't meet all of the specifications above, you should look into buying the older AirTags.\n\nThat's not because the new AirTags won't work just as well; I only say this because you can save some serious money. Instead of dropping $99 on a four-pack of second-gen AirTags, you can currently spend $69.99 on a four-pack of first-gen AirTags. These trackers will work exactly the same, minus the louder speaker on the second-gen AirTags, all the while saving you $30. You can also save a bit off a single AirTag, as the first-gen AirTags are going for $25.99 on Amazon.\n\nIf you'd rather future-proof your AirTags, you could spend full-price on the second-gens without worry. However, if you don't plan to upgrade your iPhone anytime soon, this is a pretty solid deal.",

    "title": "How to Set a Different Volume Level for Each App on Your Mac",
    "description": "It's as simple as moving a slider, but did you know that you can set a different volume level for each Mac app?",
    "fullText": "A free app that lets you lower or mute alert tones while maintaining media volume, FineTune is good enough for most people. It's open-source, and has a few simple sliders that let you control each app's volume level. My previous pick for this job—BackgroundMusic—no longer works well, as it hasn't been updated in a while. FineTune's come in to fill that gap nicely, and it does what it says on the tin.\n\nOnce you install the app, you can click its menu bar icon to finetune any individual app's volume. When an app starts playing audio on your Mac, it'll appear in FineTune's interface. And once you're done moving your sliders to change volume levels, you'll quickly discover a couple of other useful features, such as controlling the volume levels of each of your output device (speakers, headphones, etc.), and an equalizer for each app on your computer. You can also send audio from one app to a specific speaker or headphone. I've used these features to lower my AirPods' volume while keeping my Mac's speaker louder, and to set a bass-friendly EQ preset on those AirPods. You can play around with these tools to get the job done according to your needs, too.\n\nFineTune also has a convenient volume boost feature, which lets you increase the volume up to 400% on a per-app basis. This is good for files where the volume levels are almost inaudible, but I'd be choosy about how you use it.\n\nMost people will be happy with FineTune's feature set and lack of a price tag. However, if you need an app that can control AirPlay devices in your house, send audio to multiple devices at once, enable a per-app EQ with two dozen presets, set a preferred device order for audio output, and much more, then you should consider SoundSource 6 ($49). The app's been around for over a decade, and the newest version released towards the end of 2025.\n\nWith SoundSource, the basic functionality lets you control the audio levels of each app, but it also has a few other neat touches. My favorite feature is the one that lets you mute all sound effects with just one click. I'm not sure about you, but alert sounds from messaging apps tend to make me a bit anxious. Some of my friends tend to send multiple short texts at once, too, which makes my Mac's speaker go off like a siren. I've tried putting my Mac on do-not-disturb mode, but that hides those alerts altogether, which isn't ideal either. Ever since I got SoundSource, I've just muted all sound effects. This lets me receive notifications without the annoying tones, and it allows me to watch movies sans interruptions from alert tones.\n\nYou can also group multiple devices in SoundSource, and send audio to all of them at once, which is an easy way to create a multi-room audio setup. Of course, you can't have your audio 100% in sync, so don't get your hopes up about creating a surround sound system with five cheap Bluetooth speakers. However, it's good enough if you just want to have music playing in every room of your house while you cook, clean, or just move around. SoundSource's support for AirPlay devices means that you can send audio to your HomePod and other AirPlay devices like TVs or speakers, too.\n\nSoundSource also has granular controls for various features. As an example, you can set up a keyboard shortcut to increase or decrease your microphone's volume, or to mute the mic altogether. Another interesting feature lets you set up a mute timer, which sets the volume to zero for up to 2 minutes for specific apps or output devices. It's clear by now that SoundSource has lots of great features under the hood, which is amazing for power users, but probably overkill for anyone who just wants to set separate volume levels for a couple apps. The good news is that SoundSource offers a free trial that lets you use all of its features for up to 20 minutes at a time, so you can try it out to see if it's worth buying.",

    "title": "'Garden of Eden': the Spanish farm growing citrus you've never heard of",
    "description": "Todolí foundation produces varieties from Buddha’s hands to sudachi and hopes to help citrus survive climate change",
    "fullText": "Todolí foundation produces varieties from Buddha’s hands to sudachi and hopes to help citrus survive climate change\n\nIt was on a trip with a friend to the east coast of Spain that Matthew Slotover came across the “Garden of Eden”, an organic farm growing citrus varieties he had never heard of. The Todolí Citrus Foundation is a nonprofit venture and the largest private collection of citrus in the world with more than 500 varieties, and its owners think the rare fruit could hold the genetic secrets to growing citrus groves that can deal with climate change.\n\nThe farm yields far more interesting fruit than oranges and lemons for Slotover’s menu, including kumquat, finger lime, sudachi and bergamot.\n\nThey grow everything completely naturally, and the groves have become a haven for frogs, goldfinches and bees.\n\nSlotover is the founder of Toklas in London, one of Nigella Lawson’s favourite restuarants. She recently raved about a dinner there that included langoustine and scallops with Rangpur lime and Spanish sweet limetta, and a “heavenly” guava roll with Shikuwasa mandarin.\n\nWhen Slotover visited the Todolí farm, he was awestruck. “It was like the Garden of Eden”, he said. “I just cannot tell you what the experience was like … I knew about oranges and lemons and limes and grapefruit. I didn’t know about tangelos and finger limes and citrons and pomelo.”\n\nHe tries to source most of the food on his European-inspired menu from the UK. “But citrus is too good to miss,” he said, during a visit to the Oxford Real Farming conference earlier this month. He teamed up with chefs to bring over some rare varieties from the farm, and they became so popular he passed distribution over to the organic food supplier Shrub, which sells them to chefs across London.\n\nFinger limes, also known as caviar limes, frequently feature on Slotover’s menu. They contain zesty pearls that burst in the mouth and have a fragrant sweet-and-sour flavour.\n\nThe citrus collection had no commercial purpose before the chefs discovered it. “When we first approached the owner Vincente [Todolí, the former Tate Modern director], he said: ‘We don’t really sell it. We give it to friends, we have an Italian guy who makes ice-cream with it.’ And what we’ve been doing with it since has been really helpful to the farm,” Slotover said.\n\nThe foundation’s technical director, Óscar Olivares-Fuster, said it operated differently to the commercial farms nearby.\n\n“Spain is the world’s largest exporter of fresh citrus,” he said. “We at Todolí do organic, we don’t use pesticides, we work with nature. Our climate, the cold nights, warm days and sea breeze help us with all our varieties, more or less.”\n\nRather than using artificial irrigation, which is water-intensive, they have learned from the ancient Arab practices and use irrigation ditches and ponds, which are not only attractive to look at but store water very well.\n\nThey have also created a haven for songbirds previously linked to Valencia’s citrus groves but which have been wiped out by herbicides and insecticides.\n\n“We have a bank of genes here, with hundreds of varieties of citrus. This is something unique to study,” Olivares-Fuster said. “Investigating these will be key for citrus to survive all the challenges that are coming, including climate change. Eventually, citrus will be grown north of the Pyrenees and we might struggle in the south.”\n\nOne of his favourite varieties to grow is the trifoliate orange. It is a small, very sharp fruit used mostly in jams and marmalades or as a substitute for lemon zest in recipes.\n\nHe said it was interesting because unlike other citrus varieties “it will shed its leaves in winter. This means it can be very resistant to cold”. Perhaps scientists could use this genetic trait to help other citrus varieties survive in colder climates, he suggested.\n\nThe farm grows 40 Japanese citrus varieties, including the Kiyomi tangor, but also the Valentine pomelo, a sweet fruit often grown in California. Chefs are keen on calamansi, a small, sour fruit originally from the Philippines, and the fragrant Borneo lumia.",

    "description": "The year just started, and Amazon's already paying over $3 billion in legal settlements.",
    "fullText": "January isn't over yet, and Amazon's already set to pay more than $3 billion to U.S. customers across various settlements. If you've bought anything from Amazon recently, keep an eye out: Bezos' baby could owe you some money.\n\nIf you've had difficulty returning an Amazon package recently, you could have a paycheck coming your way soon. As reported by Reuters, the company has agreed to a $309 million cash settlement (in addition to \"other benefits\") with affected customers, alongside more than $600 million in individual refunds. According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the settlement as a whole provides more than $1 billion in relief.\n\nThe lawsuit accused the e-commerce giant of causing \"substantial unjustified monetary losses\" with its return policies, which the plaintiffs say resulted in many customers returning items only to be charged for them anyway. Amazon denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but did say it will spend more than $363 million improving its return and refund practices.\n\nThe company claims that, after an internal review last year, it \"identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent to us, so no refund had been issued.\" However, Amazon said it had taken steps to resolve the issue, as seen in the refunds on years-old returns the company started issuing last year.\n\nThe settlement is still awaiting approval from U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead in Seattle, but as both parties support it, it'll likely come soon. The class would cover \"U.S. purchasers of goods on Amazon from Sept 2017 who allegedly did not receive timely or correct refunds, or who were later charged despite returning items,\" writes Reuters.\n\nIt's currently unclear how class members would file a claim, or how the $309 million cash settlement and $600 million individual refunds will be divvied up. However, the plaintiffs told the court that class members should expect to recover the full amount of lost funds, plus interest.\n\nEligible class members are often contacted by email, so keep an eye out. In the meantime, you can also search for legal updates using the case name, \"In re: Amazon Return Policy Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, No. 2:23-CV-1372-JNW.\"\n\nWhile Amazon's returns settlement is still in its early phases, it's not the biggest payout the company's had to make this year. Earlier this January, Amazon reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the FTC over accusations that it had essentially tricked people into either signing up for or staying subscribed to Prime. Claims are going out in two ways, one of which is automatic, and the other you have to \n\nAccording to the settlement website, as well as the FTC, automatic payments should have gone out already, and applied to people who meet the following requirements:\n\nYou are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime between June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025, and\n\nYou enrolled through a Challenged Enrollment Flow, and\n\nYou used no more than three Prime benefits in a 12-month period from June 23, 2019 and June 23, 2025.\n\nIf that doesn't sound like you, or you didn't receive a payment, you'll need to file a claim using the \"File Claim\" button on the settlement website. You're eligible to do this if you meet the follow requirements:\n\nYou are a U.S. consumer who signed up for Prime, and\n\nYou unintentionally enrolled in a Prime membership through a challenged enrollment method at issue in the FTC’s lawsuit from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025; or you tried to cancel your Prime membership through the online cancellation process from June 23, 2019 to June 23, 2025, but were unable to do so; and\n\nYou used less than ten Prime benefits (e.g., delivery, shopping, streaming, reading, and other benefits provided to Prime members) during any 12-month period of enrollment in Prime, and\n\nYou did not receive an automatic payment as part of this Settlement already.\n\nNeither website is entirely clear about what constitutes \"challenged enrollment,\" aside from saying that Amazon enrolled customers in Prime without their knowledge or consent. Luckily, you probably won't need to do any legwork to see if you're eligible.\n\nAccording to the FTC, Amazon has begun sending claim notices by mail or email to eligible Prime customers who didn't already get an automatic refund. This will be your cue to If you believe you're eligible for a share of the settlement but Amazon did not contact you, you can reach out to [email protected] for help.\n\nOnce you file your claim, you can choose to be paid either through check, PayPal, or Venmo. Expected payments will differ from person to person, but will cap out at $51. And there's no need to rush. The deadline to file a claim is July 27, 2026, so you've got some time to ensure you get what you're owed.",

    "title": "Android Auto's Best Kept Secret Is a Programmable Shortcut",
    "description": "Run complex actions and routines with a single button press.",
    "fullText": "There's so much visual stuff you can customize in Android Auto. But Android Auto's capabilities go beyond aesthetics and the apps that pop up when you turn on the car. There's a hidden shortcut switch you can enable to run an action in the car that's programmed on your phone. No matter what car you're driving, if it has Android Auto, the shortcut is there.\n\nThis is the Custom Assistant Shortcut, and it's been part of Android Auto since early 2021. The feature is worth revisiting now that Gemini is slowly rolling out to replace the legacy Google Assistant on Android Auto. Gemini's natural language processing enables it to handle more complex routines, so you're not just programming a rote command you could have otherwise said out loud. The Custom Assistant Shortcut is labeled a \"secret\" feature because it's camouflaged beneath a main text label in the Android Auto settings menu. I didn't even think to look for it until I stumbled across the trick on an Android blog, but once you find it, it only takes a minute to set up.\n\nThere are several ways to configure the Custom Assistant Shortcut. For example, if you rely on the latest episode of a podcast to carry you through the morning commute, you could set up a shortcut to play the most recent episode via an app that plays well with Gemini, like Spotify or YouTube Music. I prefer to use the Custom Assistant Shortcut for a simpler sequence of actions: finding the nearest branded gas station, no matter where I am in my journey. I programmed the shortcut with the command \"Navigate to the nearest [branded gas station].\" This begins driving directions to the fuel station I specified, where I can count on adequate lighting and decent bathrooms. It's easier than pawing through the Google Maps app on the Android Auto screen, then looking for the sub-menu option that shows fuel stops, and then sorting through every single option within five miles when you select it. This version of the shortcut is also super helpful on road trips, especially solo ones.\n\nIf you're into home automation, this shortcut gets even more powerful. You can program a Google Home Routine so that a phrase triggers a domino effect of actions. Imagine a routine that prepares for your arrival by opening the garage door, disarming the security system, and turning on the lights before you've ever pulled into the driveway.\n\nYou don't need to be in your car to set up the Custom Assistant Action. On your phone, navigate to your Android Auto settings, then scroll down and tap on Customize launcher. Under the main heading, tap the smaller text that says Add a shortcut to the launcher. Select an Assistant action.\n\nFrom here, the most robust option is to write out a specific command. Something like \"Navigate Home,\" or \"Play the latest episode of [podcast title] on [media player].\"\n\nYou can take the shortcut for a spin in your car before hitting the road. The ability to test the command will pop up when you connect your phone to the car. You'll see your new shortcut appear in the app drawer as a standard app icon. It will have a small Gemini asterisk in the corner to distinguish it from native apps (it may still show the legacy Assistant icon in your phone's settings).\n\nThe \"Test Command\" button is on the same page where you set up the Custom Assistant Shortcut. Tap it, and you'll know your shortcut is working if the signature rainbow Gemini glow pulses at the bottom of the screen. If not, try adjusting the wording of your command and continue testing until it's a go.\n\nThese actions are tied to your Google account on your phone, so if you hop into another car with Android Auto, the button will follow you to the display. Remember that Gemini requires a stable data connection to process those requests. If you're driving through a cellular \"dead zone,\" the shortcut might hang, which is annoying while driving. If the shortcut is hard to find in the app drawer, remember you can return to the Customize Launcher menu in the phone's settings and reorder the shortcuts so they're at the top of the drawer.",

    "description": "Matching murders for complicated couples.",
    "fullText": "The first of a trio of Alice Feeney thrillers getting streaming series adaptations, His & Hers is a glossy, brisk and, perhaps most importantly, twisty Netflix mystery starring Tessa Thompson and Jon Bernthal. Thompson plays Annie Andrews, a has-been news reporter who decides to get back on the horse when she learns of a murder in her Georgia hometown. Bernthal is the local detective on the case and—surprise!—he's also her ex.\n\nHis & Hers is a big hit for Netflix, and a particularly buzzy and bingable example of the form. If you're looking for more of the same after finishing the last episode, here are a dozen more shows filled with zigzagging plots, complicated families, and women who are much more than mere victims.\n\nScandinavian cop drama (or Nordic noir, if you prefer) is its own sub-genre, so ubiquitous that the Disney+ show Agatha All Along did an episode parodying the form. Certainly The Åre Murders makes the case that Swedes know from murder. Plain-spoken, troubled (as in: under suspension) detective Hanna Ahlander leaves Stockholm to spend some time unwinding at her sister's place in remote Åre. A case involving a missing girl finds her back on the job, and up against local police officer Daniel Lindskog, who she's reluctant to trust. The dynamic isn't entirely dissimilar to that of reporter Anna Andrews and her cop ex in His & Hers. Looking for a bleakly beautiful landscape and ambiguous morality? Åre might be the place for you. You can stream The Åre Murders on Netflix.\n\nIn this adaptation of the Gillian Flynn novel, Amy Adams stars as Camille Preaker, a troubled reporter with substance abuse issues who's only recently been released from a psychiatric hospital. I'm not sure what step of recovery involves returning to her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri in order to investigate the murder of one girl and the apparently related disappearance of another—all under the watchful, critical eye of her socialite mother Adora (Patricia Clarkson). Like His & Hers, the plot turns a couple of gut-punch twists. Stream Sharp Objects on HBO Max.\n\nKate Winslet picked up an Emmy for her performance as thoroughly troubled Mare Sheehan, a local hero in her days as a high school basketball champ whose adult reputation is rapidly losing its luster. As a police detective, she's been unable to solve the case of a missing girl even as she's confronted with a recently murdered teenage mother—you probably won't be surprised to find that the cases are linked. Word on the street is that a second season might be in the works. Stream Mare of Easttown on HBO Max.\n\nThis twist-a-minute thriller stars Clare Danes as grieving mother and author Aggie Wiggs, who struggling with her next book, and decides to focus it on her neighbor, who was accused of murdering his first wife. What could go wrong? Matthew Rhys plays Nile Jarvis, the maybe-murderer neighbor, who gets caught up in the mix when Abbie's story becomes about way more than just one death. Stream The Beast in Me on Netflix.\n\nLiane Moriarty's novels have been adapted successfully in the past, from HBO's Big Little Lies to Hulu's Nine Perfect Strangers. Her work generally, and Apples Never Fall specifically, focuses more on mystery than thrills, but those twisty-turny plots are what we're here for. This miniseries follows the Delaney family, whose four siblings are forced to confront their dark family history following the disappearance of their mother Joy (Annette Benning)—a disappearance in which their father Stand (Sam Neill), is a person of interest. Stream Apples Never Fall on Peacock.\n\nThough a bit \n\nClara Merlo (Catalina Sopelana) is a medical resident in a big city hospital. One shift, she collapses, waking weeks later to learn that he heart failed and she's received a transplant. Though donors are anonymous, she decides that she really needs to know about the person whose heart she's walking around with—which is where we enter into \"What could possibly go wrong?\" territory. She manages to trace the donation to a family in the small town of Yesques, where she learns that the father of of her donor went missing years ago, while brother Juan (Alfons Nieto) has joined the police force. Good thing, too: she'll need his help when she winds up involved in a mystery that goes back two decades. Stream The Crystal Cuckoo on Netflix.\n\nThe first season ranked as Apple's most watched limited series ever, so naturally we're getting a second, based on another bestseller by Laura Dave. Jennifer Garner stars as Hannah Hall, a successful woodturner (now there's a new one in crime thrillers) trying to forge a bond with her stepdaughter in order to help solve the mystery of her missing husband. Stream The Last Thing He Told Me on Apple TV+.\n\nFollowing his wife's death, Yeong-ha (Kim Yoon-seok) just wants a quiet life in the secluded town where he lives—though he's not even all that enthusiastic about that. It's all going fine until a young woman shows up at the rental unit next door with her son, then abruptly vanishes, leaving behind blood stains and, even more disturbingly, the kid. This slow-burn, cinematic thriller has a storytelling structure that would be a spoiler to say too much about, but puzzing through it is definitely rewarding. Stream The Frog on Netflix.\n\nA distinctive police thriller imported from Spain, When No One Sees Us stars Mariela Garriga (Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning) as a Cuban-American special agent of the U.S. Army, and Maribel Verdú (Pan’s Labyrinth) as a Spanish Civil Guard sergeant struggling with a complex home life. Both are investigating an apparent death by violent suicide on an air base during Holy Week. It's another complex mystery, but the performances and the emphasis on character over plot make it a standout. Stream When No One Sees Us on HBO Max.\n\nCreated, written, and directed by four-time Oscar winner Alfonso Cuarón, Disclaimer has as impressive a pedigree as you could hope for on streaming TV. Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline (both, incidentally, Oscar winners) star alongside Sacha Baron Cohen and Leila George. Blanchett plays Catherine Ravenscroft, an award-winning journalist who receives a mysterious manuscript—a novel in which she, herself, appears to be the main character, and which reveals secrets of her past that she thought were long buried. Stream Disclaimer on Apple TV+.\n\nThere's something to be said for each of the True Detective's four seasons, but Night Country moves away from the the sweaty bro energy of earlier seasons for a much frostier mystery involving missing scientists at a research station near a tiny Alaskan town, where the dark and the cold are practically characters themselves. The resulting mystery ties together veteran Chief Liz Danvers (Jodie Foster) and Trooper Evangeline Navarro (Kali Reis), two women with complicated pasts and screwed-up present family lives. The resolution to the mind-bending mystery drew a lot of debate, but the performances and chilly sense of magical realist dread are top tier. Stream True Detective: Night Country on HBO Max.",

    "fullText": "Drag gestures are far less common on the web than on mobile. I wanted to try how they feel on the web, so I built this iOS 26 inspired gesture with Motion as an exercise.\n\nDrag items to the left or right to see the interaction.\n\nIn terms of structure, the component is fairly straightforward. We start with the outer container and add overflow-clip which clips everything but prevents scrolling. Inside we have a div with the content that handles the gesture.\n\nFor the gesture, we will be using the drag prop from Motion. We start by defining the x value using the useMotionValue hook, where x is how far the draggable row shifts horizontally.\n\nMotion updates x continuously while you drag. You don't need to calculate distances manually.\n\nWe then pass the x value to the style prop of the motion.div and use drag=\"x\" to make the row draggable on the x-axis only.\n\nDrag the ball and change the modes to see the difference\n\nIn addition to setting up the drag gesture itself, you can also define its behavior.\n\ndragConstraints allows you to define the boundaries of the draggable area. In this component, we limit the draggable area to the left and right of the row.\n\nDrag the ball and toggle constraints to see the difference\n\ndragElastic controls the resistance when dragging past the boundaries. Lower values like 0.05 add very little overshoot, while higher values allow more before snapping back.\n\nDrag the ball past the boundary to see the elastic effect\n\nSetting dragMomentum to false removes the fling effect. For swipe actions, you want the row to stop where you decide, not where velocity decides.\n\nFlick the ball quickly and release to see the momentum effect\n\nWhen the drag ends, the row needs to snap to either left, right or center depending on the direction.\n\nBased on the x value when drag ends, we can determine the snap point. If you don't drag far enough, the row will snap to the center. If you cross the threshold, the row will snap to the nearest side.\n\nPOSITION_THRESHOLD is the commit point. Anything below it closes, anything above it opens.\n\nSetting dragMomentum to false is what makes this feel consistent. The row always lands on your snap points instead of overshooting based on velocity.\n\nThe original iOS gesture doesn’t reveal all actions at once. The first action appears first, the second one only when you drag past a certain threshold. The two thresholds I used are 44px and 88px.\n\nTo do this, compare the motion value against the thresholds.\n\nWe could also have this calculation be in percentages, but I like to keep it in pixels so I can easily tweak the values. We then use the isVisible prop to animate the button.\n\nIn addition to the drag gesture, there are a couple other animations in this component, with the first one being the indicators.\n\nWe render them conditionally, animate opacity and scale and wrap it in an AnimatePresence to handle the exit animation. Depending on where the indicator renders, we add a corresponding origin so it animates in from the correct direction.\n\nThe trash button uses a clip-path overlay and renders different trash icons and background colors depending on the state.\n\nI made a collection of buttons like these a while back.\n\nIn case you have any questions reach me at jakub@kbo.sk, see more of my work on Twitter or \n\nI share stuff that I'm working on, new posts and resources here.",

    "description": "New name, same problems.",
    "fullText": "On Monday, I was introduced to \"Clawdbot,\" the latest AI craze taking over tech social media channels. Clawdbot is designed to be an agentic personal assistant. In layman's terms, that means the bot can perform tasks on your behalf: You give it full access to your computer, and it can organize your inbox, code for you, or clear your calendar (allegedly, anyway). You can also talk to it from a chat app of your choice, like WhatsApp or iMessage, rather than it's own interface. Some people are even buying Mac minis exclusively to run Clawdbot from.\n\nIf you're wondering where that name came from, it takes after another AI company's product. Creator Peter Steinberger says he was inspired by the monster that appears when users reload Claude Code—Claude being one of the big AI products in the space right now, developed by the company Anthropic. Steinberger decided to go the lobster route with his logo, and named his own lobster mascot \"Clawd.\" From this, Clawdbot was born. The problem: Anthropic also calls Claude Code mascot \"Clawd.\" Whoops.\n\nAside from the name change, the bot appears to be the same as it was on Monday. That is to say, it's still open source, still available to run locally on your own device, and still comes with the same inherent security risks I outlined yesterday. I still wouldn't recommend you install a program like Moltbot on your personal device, since, name change or not, you'd still be giving it incredible access to your hardware and its data with little knowledge of the safeguards in place to protect it. All it could take is one malicious prompt injection for Moltbot to molt your security.",

    "description": "A deep dive into Trinity Large, covering architecture, sparsity, training at scale, and why we shipped Preview, Base, and TrueBase checkpoints.",
    "fullText": "A deep dive into Trinity Large, covering architecture, sparsity, training at scale, and why we shipped Preview, Base, and TrueBase checkpoints.\n\nTwo months ago I wrote about why we decided to stop treating pretraining like someone else's job.\n\nAt the time, Trinity Nano Preview and Trinity Mini had just released, and Trinity Large had started training. We were in the middle of our first run so big that you either laughed or got nauseous. Frankly, I felt either we’d end up with a really great base model or fall flat on our faces with a tired wallet.\n\nLittle did I know, we’d get both.\n\nHere’s what we’re shipping, what surprised us, what broke, and what it took to make a 400B sparse MoE behave.\n\nWe're putting out three variants: Trinity-Large-Preview is lightly post-trained and chat-ready, Trinity-Large-Base is our best pretraining checkpoint after the full 17T recipe, and TrueBase is an early checkpoint from the same run at 10T tokens, without any instruct data or LR anneals. What many would consider a true base model.\n\nTrinity-Large is a 400B parameter sparse MoE with 13B active parameters per token. It uses 256 experts with 4 experts active per token. That sparsity ratio is pretty high compared to our peers, save for Llama-4-Maverick:\n\nWe originally aimed for a slightly different total size (420B), but we ended up increasing the number of dense layers (from 3 to 6) to help keep routing stable at this sparsity.\n\nTrinity-Large-Base is a true frontier-class foundation model. We match and exceed our peers in open-base models across a wide range of benchmarks, including math, coding, scientific reasoning, and raw knowledge absorption.\n\nWe trained on 2048 Nvidia B300 GPUs. As far as we can tell, it’s the largest (publicly stated, at least) pretraining run done on these machines. That means two things:\n\nTherefore, we had to make the most of the money we allotted to these machines, which was just over 30 days. Ridiculously fast for a run of this scale, so efficient training was the name of the game. Hence, the level of sparsity referred to above. Combined with our efficient attention outlined in our technical report, this enabled us to train and, by extension, run inference much faster than our peers in the same weight class. All while not sacrificing performance. Roughly 2-3x faster for the same hardware.\n\nWe keep MoE routing under control by nudging each expert’s router bias up or down depending on whether that expert is being over- or under-used. The update is capped with a tanh clip so it stays bounded, and we add momentum to smooth it across steps and avoid step-to-step ping-pong. On top of that, we include a small per-sequence balance loss so load is not only balanced in expectation across the batch, but also within individual sequences.\n\nWe use z-loss to stop the LM-head logits from drifting upward during training. It is a lightweight regularizer that keeps logit scale from creeping up without bound. We also log basic logit stats (for example max and mean) as a simple early warning for instability.\n\nThe exact equations are in the technical report.\n\nOur fastest configuration was HSDP with expert parallelism set to 8, which gave us 2048 data-parallel ranks. In that setup, we pushed throughput further by increasing batch size after 5T tokens of training. We were comfortable doing that because the model is highly sparse, Muon supports a larger critical batch size than AdamW, and the MiniMax-01 paper suggests batch-size scaling remains workable in this regime.\n\nIn the main run, once we had stability dialed in, the loss curve stayed smooth the whole way through. You can see clear phase transitions, no spikes, and a steady march to the end.\n\nThe full pretraining run finished in 33 days. That's pre-training only; it doesn't include context extension or post-training.\n\nTrinity Large was trained on 17T tokens of data curated by DatologyAI, split across three phases of 10T, 4T, and 3T tokens. This mix uses state-of-the art programming, STEM, reasoning, and multilingual data curation, targeting 14 non-English languages. Notably, over 8 trillion tokens of synthetic data were generated for this dataset across web, code, math, reasoning, and multilingual domains, using a breadth of state-of-the-art rephrasing approaches.\n\nA less advanced version of this curation approach worked well for smaller models like Trinity Nano and Trinity Mini, but we wanted to shoot for the moon with Trinity Large. So DatologyAI delivered a number of curation advancements specifically for inclusion into Trinity Large. There’s always a leap of faith when doing something for the first time in public, but the effectiveness of the curation approach as a whole is reflected in the downstream evaluations, where the Trinity Large-Base demonstrates frontier-level performance across the targeted capability domains.\n\nThe preview we’re releasing today is not a reasoning model. A benefit beyond production inference efficiency is that it also carries over into RL, enabling quicker rollouts for a given total parameter size. But it’s equally as sensitive as pretraining was, and while it’s currently undergoing further post-training and will be a full-fledged reasoning model upon release, we believe there’s a fine line between intelligence and usefulness, and while the reasoning variant is very intelligent, it needs longer in training before it becomes maximally useful given the extra tokens per output.\n\nAs such, to maximize usefulness and provide an early checkpoint, Preview is a non-reasoning, or “instruct,” model. It’s a particularly light post-training, as most of our compute went towards pre-training and is continuing with the reasoning version. It is an extremely capable model for its size and gave us the opportunity to flex some old-school post-training muscles we haven’t had the chance to flex in quite some time. It excels in creative writing, storytelling, role-play, chat scenarios, and real-time voice assistance, better than your average reasoning model usually can. But we’re also introducing some of our newer agentic performance. It was trained to navigate well in agent harnesses like OpenCode, Cline, and Kilo Code, and to handle complex toolchains and long, constraint-filled prompts. It certainly isn’t perfect, but we cannot wait to see what you do with it. It’s free in OpenRouter until Large (non-preview) fully releases.\n\nIt’s currently roughly in line with Llama-4-Maverick’s Instruct model across standard academic benchmarks, and we’ll update this blog over time with more evaluations.\n\nBut we like to tease, so I’ll leave you with some early evaluations of the reasoning Trinity-Large. These are not exhaustive, and by no means representative of the full capabilities of any of these models, but it is a fun look at how we plan to take this model.\n\nWhen we started this run, we had never pretrained anything remotely like this before.\n\nThere was no guarantee this would work. Not the modeling, not the data, not the training itself, not the operational part where you wake up, and a job that costs real money is in a bad state, and you have to decide whether to restart or try to rescue it.\n\nAll in—compute, salaries, data, storage, ops—we pulled off this entire effort for $20 million. 4 Models got us here in 6 months.\n\nThat number is big for us. It's also small compared to what frontier labs spend just to keep the lights on. We don't have infinite retries.\n\nOne more thing about Trinity-Large-TrueBase.\n\nMost \"base\" releases have some instruction data baked in. TrueBase doesn't. It's 10T tokens of pretraining on a 400B sparse MoE, with no instruct data and no LR annealing.\n\nIf you're a researcher who wants to study what high-quality pretraining produces at this scale—before any RLHF, before any chat formatting—this is one of the few checkpoints where you can do that. We think there's value in having a real baseline to probe, ablate, or just observe. What did the model learn from the data alone? TrueBase is where you answer that question.\n\nOpenRouter has Trinity-Large-Preview available now, free during the preview period (through at least February 2026). If you want to kick the tires without spinning up infrastructure, that's the fastest path.\n\nWe also worked with Kilo Code, Cline, and OpenCode to have integrations ready at launch. If you're already using one of those for coding, Trinity Large should show up as an option. This is an extremely young post-train, in the scheme of RL runs that go on for months at a time, like our peers. We’ll get there soon, but we’re oh-so-proud to have our own model to do it with. Expect rough edges, specifically in coding agents. For everyday agents, though, it’s outstanding.\n\nTrinity Large natively supports 512k context.\n\nThe preview API is running at 128k context with 8-bit quantization as we tune our inference infrastructure. This release is as much a preview of our hosting platform as it is a model launch.\n\nIf you put this model into something real and it breaks, tell us. The fastest way for open models to get better is for people to actually use them, hard, in places that don't look like benchmarks.\n\nWe like to say that we built Trinity so you can own it. Being able to say that about a frontier-level model is something we’re immeasurably proud of.",

    "fullText": "This is the concluding follow up to the article on ‘Arcan as Operating System Design‘. When combined, we have reach the end of trying to explain what Arcan actually ‘is’ on a higher level. After this we can revisit the topic in a first order form as ‘Implementation’.\n\nIn the first slides from the only public presentation (2015) we claimed that the idea behind Arcan was to find the crunchy middle between a display server, a game engine and a multimedia processor.\n\nThe control plane to this “desktop engine” was designed for a scripting API targeting entry-level developers. Lua remain as the weapon of choice for that role as a better follow up to the ‘BASIC’ of the home computer era, but also as an intermediate for other tools to compile to.\n\nTo make a long story short: That, my friends, is a browser; just average in a few areas, yet create something interesting out of orchestrated mediocrity — not unlike musical theatre.\n\nIn order to get anywhere on such a broad topic we will need to limit the scope a bit or we will be here all day. The web itself is as much, or more, social structures growing and evolving as a bacterium on a technological substrate than it is any singular piece of technology.\n\nEven if some cry out in doom and gloom about the dominance of Chrome ‘the browser’ (albeit also Chrome as Chrome OS and Chrome as Electron), do remember that it is still subject to other pieces like the server, the protocols, the app and the structural glue that is ‘the link‘. If you want to offset one part, you ought to consider how well it plays with the others as well.\n\nThis article will only focus on the technical side to the user facing access to this substrate. That is the browser software itself. An example of the makings of another ‘web’ to go with it, sponsored by NLnet (https://nlnet.nl/project/Arcan-A12/), is covered in ‘Arcan-a12: Weaving a Different Web‘ but it is architecturally loosely coupled.\n\nTo make things a little easier than what is normal around here, I will split it into a simplified ‘short form’ and as two heavier text sections.\n\nThe first section, Browser Breakdown, covers the problem space and some cherry picked history. The second, Arcan as Browser Design, goes into how we account for it.\n\nThe browser broken down is the end result of “the document” trying to envelop the computing world. The browser as proposed is “the desktop” trying to reach out.\n\nThe short form can be found here:\n\nTo demonstrate that this is existing technology, the presentation is also provided as an Arcan appl, viewable through “arcan-net arcan.divergent-desktop.org explain” (it is running on a potato used for active development).\n\nThat one happens to have been published a while ago. According to the logs, about two people have managed to find it. It seems there are lessons from the past about other meanings of “Search” that might be useful to rediscover now when more and more people and places alike are all llmpty on the inside and the noise floor is reaching the ceiling.\n\nSome suggested extended reading on the topics that will be covered here and in the next section:\n\nThe big question to unpack is if the browser is supposed to ‘present and navigate interlinked documents?’ in the spirit of the original much-too-simple hypertext, or be ‘an operating system agnostic substrate for networked applications’.\n\nLets start with a hypothetical speedrun through history.\n\nYou are back in the cosy times of the early 1990ies when computing was slow, storage was small and floppy disks got corrupted simply by staring at them for too long. You are struck with the brilliant idea of developing a software product that is supposed to just show very simple documents with formatted text in various typefaces, sizes and styles. Throw in the odd image or two. Maybe some media clip, but that can come later.\n\nThese documents should naturally be hosted and shared across networks of computers as that is faster and more convenient than copying things to floppy disks.\n\nIt turns out great with a lot of satisfied users that soon wants more. At the same time, windowing systems become more common. These force your simple document viewer to support moving things around to react to the window resizing. Users naturally want to handle different outputs, such as printers.\n\nThe documents these users have created started to form packs and people wanted ways for them to cross reference each-other and navigate these references with the click of a button. You oblige by adding ‘links’ to other documents and the option to open them in a new window.\n\nNetworks at this time are slow and servers are quite busy, so the next logical step would be some caching to make sure you only retrieve a linked document or its embedded images when something has actually changed.\n\nA ‘popular’ kind of document turned out to be ‘forms’ for people to fill out, print and post because those are like cocaine to governments and businesses alike. With that you add some way for the user to type into parts of these forms to fill them out before printing. This will save many from wasting time deciphering messy handwriting. Both throughput and accuracy improves greatly.\n\nStill people manage to fill them out wrong — to err is human and all that. It would save everyone time if you just add some easy way to have presets to chose from; a list box here and a radio box there. Soon enough every UI ‘widget’ imaginable has managed to join in, but you still think of it as a ‘document’ in the end.\n\nWhy even go through the pains of printing and posting? We can just sneak in some magic to POST the filled form as an e-mail or send it to the same place the document was hosted. Even better, we can embed some code to make sure that some of the inputs the user provides can be checked for errors locally and tell the user about any errors.\n\nIf something is made programmable, it follows that some crazy hacker kids will figure out creative ways to take advantage of this to do all sorts of unintended things. It did not take long before the documents started spawning little cats chasing the mouse pointer around.\n\nDocuments reshaping themselves as they were being viewed became the new normal. That is a big change in expectations for all stakeholders.\n\nYou should be able to see where this is going by now — It doesn’t take that many feature requests for a static document to become a dynamic application, similar to how few wrong turns it take to make a regular language grammar into a recursively enumerable one.\n\nTo keep up with new discoveries in everything from image compression to network communication lots of new code got written in order to support new media formats and more advanced protocols.\n\nThe easiest way to make software do new things is to add more code, and the path of least resistance is typically the one people follow. This is where software architecture matters and stops being just boxes and arrows on a whiteboard somewhere; it sets the constraints for how new code combines with the old.\n\nJust adding more code to solve for new features rather than refactoring to be more clever about things comes at a cost. More code means more potential bugs. Mix in economic incentives and some of those bugs turn into opportunities to exploit which calls for mitigation strategies.\n\nOne of the more potent ones are sometimes called sandboxing (a terrible term but that is another can of worms best left unopened) and comes with heavy requirements on security boundaries. Re-architecting to do that successfully is not for the faint of heart or light of wallet.\n\nIn the browser case, such a project comes with another interesting side effect: you are now compositing and routing inputs and outputs between a number of interactive sources and sinks across several privilege boundaries.\n\nThat is how you end up with something like this:\n\nCongratulations, you’ve made a display server with the weakest windowing system in town. Instead of leveraging the IPC system for better ways of collaborating with local software they stuck to crude left-overs from the outer windowing system like clipboards, drag and drop or, sigh, “portals”.\n\nA historically interesting tangent is that Microsoft was on this trajectory way back when and got close to a stronger solution through its COM/OLE/ActiveX path before falling into the antitrust trials pit (not that the idea went away).\n\nNow every few years there is some take on the “Java Applet” form of assimilation by forced cross compilation to an embedded executable format referenced from the document (which turns the document into a de-facto format for linking and loading yet with few of the insights embedded in proper executable formats) to target a virtual machine. Shockwave Flash being a notable one, and “WebAssembly” a more recent attempt.\n\nWhat if, instead of trying to regress towards “simple” in the browser domain (just to see the same story repeat itself) or in the data model (and still be stuck with the same browser story) – we assume the networked application endgame from the start and design for that?\n\nTo summarise the previous section – the browser started as linked documents breaking down into a networked application with ‘the document’ organically turning into ‘an executable format’.\n\nIn a spider graph form they went from this:\n\nThese are, of course, rough estimates. Improvements along each feature axis is exponentially more difficult and expensive.\n\nThe expected and required feature-space span the entire gradient:\n\nIt is worthwhile to note that it can transition from any point on the gradient to another. You get no guarantees about where you start, or if it will stay that way, unless you disable expected features with unpredictable results.\n\nWe can say the processing is iterative and the linking (as in program execution) is dynamic and mutable (events triggering code pulling in remote code hooking events).\n\nIn contrast, Arcan started at roughly this back in the early 2000s when hope was high and life worth living:\n\nThe processing looks like this:\n\nWe can say the processing is planar, static and recursive. With planar we mean that if there is a document stage, there is a discrete and decoupled transition from that into the app form. You know, a build system: compile, link/package, execute.\n\nThis means that the “as document” part of the runtime are separate tools not part of the browser itself. It only concerns itself with being an execution environment for the networked application. This keeps the browser part from having to walk an endless trail of outdated formats. Some are already conditioned to this approach with that of “static site generators”, it is just the output format that needs some change to move away from document to document translation.\n\nWith static it means that the compiled app is not capable of loading code outside of its own package, except for a set of preset helper scripts. This is the default with a user controlled opt-in rather than an opt-out as in “install extension to disable javascript”.\n\nWith recursive it means that navigating a link starts another instance of the browser that would either embed itself as any other data source in the parent, or take its place.\n\nThe emphasis on the display server aspect throughout the years here is no coincidence: it’s the weak-point of the dominant browser model and one that has very little documentation. It is also the reason why the apps developed and demonstrated here has mainly been desktop oriented — to politely point out that “you missed a spot”.\n\nChrome splits its app execution into a number of processes that are roughly “Network”, “Browser”, “UI”, “Storage”, “GPU”, “Device”, “Render” and “Plugin”. This is a logical breakdown of the internal division of responsibility. For privilege separation, each process role has a configured policy on which system resources it can access.\n\nArcan splits up its app execution into a number of processes by information transfer boundaries:\n\nThese come as a set of external clients that are picked for each instance – meaning that the supported formats, protocols and so on can be swapped out without any changes to the engine itself and per application basis. They are dependency and license “sponges”.\n\nTheir security model comes from a combination of least-privilege and capabilities. “Decode” is security wise the most sensitive one as that is where parsing of untrusted inputs go. “Encode” is privacy wise the most sensitive one as that is where the real ‘you’ distil into digital form.\n\nAfter the connection is setup, it needs no file system access at all. The system calls required match an OpenBSD pledge of “stdio sendfd recvfd” which is a hard surface to break through. Even then we have microarchitectural attacks to consider in the most hardened setups. This is where the ability to live-migrate any shmif client to a networked form comes in — you can compartment to cheap one-off devices like single board computers and the architecture still holds. Memory is never safe, wear a helmet.\n\nState store and list of permitted integrations with local software are in an SQLite database that is also picked for each instance. That local software can, of course, also be a different browser.\n\nThis becomes a hierarchy that looks like this:\n\nNot pictured here are the ‘hook-scripts’ facility which corresponds to ‘browser extensions’ in the web sense and the ‘developer tools’ sense.\n\nThe key component is the inter-process communication system (IPC). The one in Chrome, Mojo, is highly generic: an interface description language (IDL), a binding code generator and there you go. The qualities of the IDL limits what can be communicated and the binding generator affects the developer effort it takes to use. Part of the interface description links in ancillary specifications. An important one is the sandbox policy to apply.\n\nWe have seen it before: MIDL, CORBA, Fuchsia IDL, D-Bus, Wayland, Binder (AIDL) etc. ad nauseam. One may wonder how many generic ways we may need in order to eventually be specific.\n\nThe pitch for those are always ‘extendable / flexible’. I read that as ‘afraid to commit to anything’. It is a tempting model if you are unsure what you are supposed to be building (or organisation decoupling where you want formal barriers for communication between teams) and kick the bucket down the road. It is less tempting if there is ample history and plenty of examples to learn from.\n\nThe generic approach come at a cost. Code generated creeps into, or even dictates, the design of both sides and it ends up much bulkier and more verbose. It is rare for ancillary tooling support for debugging, report generation, testing, profiling etc. to be included.\n\nIn a previous life as a security auditor, a very successful path to victory was to locate any IDLs in use; patch to integrate fuzzing; deploy and wait for things to blow up. They typically do.\n\nThe IPC in Arcan, SHMIF, is highly specific. It is a lock-stepped data model with a C API. The message types and fields came from the needs of a full desktop OS, which has changed very little over the years. There is no reason to be clever, flexible or extendable. Just look at what others have done before and generalise from that. Validate against existing examples and use cases. Easy peasy.\n\nWhere we did put effort into being clever was two parts. Crash resilience and Alternate Representations.\n\nBoth are heavyweight topics in their own right, a dissertation or three, but for this context the motivation for resilience is easy enough – it allows us to redirect user workloads to relaunched instances (recovery), to others or other devices across the network (redirection) for collaboration or stronger security compartments, or to a future version of ourselves (upgrade).\n\nFor alternate representations, well we don’t all look at the world with the same eyes or desires now do we? The one that should be obvious is accessibility where the screen reader tradition is to snapshot composition state back into a document form and then navigate through voice synthesis and keyboard controls.\n\nA less obvious one is for debugging – be able to visually inspect and interact with the dynamics of the software rather than what it presents itself as. The other side of the same coin comes from malware reversing as that kind of work leverages the same kind of mechanisms. Process parasites (or as some call it, ‘Fileless malware‘) have been a thing for a very long time now, yet the generalised tools to shake them out have been sorely lacking for just as long.\n\nIn closing, there is a lot of technical detail that had to be omitted for this piece to not be completely indigestible but at the high level, there is not much more to say about the Arcan project as such. There are things left to do, but the end is in sight. Midnight draws near.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have not won the Premier League since Antonio Conte led them to the 2016-17 title - and facing the Italian's Napoli side on Wednesday brings that into sharp focus.\n\nConte's triumph came in the season when Pep Guardiola began his reign as Manchester City boss.\n\nIt was Conte's first campaign in England, too, and Chelsea enjoyed a club-record 13 consecutive league wins on their way to lifting the championship with 93 points.\n\nTheir fifth Premier League crown in 13 seasons matched Manchester United's achievement in that same period. Chelsea - or indeed United - haven't ruled the roost since, amid an extensive turnover of players and coaches.\n\nNine years down the line, we reach a dramatic finale to the Champions League's opening phase. Liam Rosenior's Chelsea need a win against Conte's Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona to go directly into the last-16 stage. Their hosts - Serie A champions last season - must win to stay in the competition.\n\nLike so many aspects of Chelsea's recent history, you'd struggle to write this script.\n\nThomas Tuchel's Champions League triumph in 2021, plus two Club World Cup titles, have been notable achievements since Conte's departure.\n\nBut in strictly Premier League terms, the peak of Conte's short stint at the wheel has not been repeated at Chelsea. They haven't really come close.\n\nRosenior, 41, is the latest of seven head coaches, not including interim appointments, to have led Chelsea since Conte was sacked in July 2018. He has been in post for a matter of weeks.\n\nSpeaking about Conte on Tuesday in Naples, Rosenior said: \"I have huge respect for him. Firstly as a player, he was a magnificent footballer. He then went on to - and still has - an incredible career as a coach.\n\n\"I think his passion as a player transmits to the passion in his teams and obviously when I was younger watching Chelsea play in the manner that they did, defensively so strong.\n\n\"[Eden] Hazard was incredible in those moments, and he [Conte] has gone on to prove what an amazing manager he is and he's won many titles, including an incredible title here last year.\"",

    "fullText": "Approximately 80% of all Americans aged 60 and older are homeowners, and housing wealth accounts for about 48% of the median wealth of that group. As retirees near large cities, and strong housing markets, start retiring, they realize they can unlock this wealth by selling their home and relocating to a more affordable area. This retire-and-relocate strategy allowed homeowners to unlock a median figure of $99,019 from their homes in 2019 and the amount went up to $347,000 for the top 10% of homeowners who relocated to less expensive housing markets. Here’s how it works and the pros of cons of relying on this strategy for your retirement.\n\nConsider working with a financial advisor to help you with your retirement needs.\n\nHow Retirees Tap Into Housing Wealth By Relocating\n\nAs retirees finish working, they no longer need to remain within a close proximity to large cities like New York, Boston or Los Angeles. Instead, they are considering moves to more affordable states that are more retirement focused like Florida or Wyoming. This not only gives them a community of retirees to socialize with but it also is opening up a large chunk of their wealth through the sale of their home.\n\nVanguard recently conducted an analysis of this group to determine how much money retirees are unlocking by selling and relocating. As of 2019, the median homeowner who had reached the age of 60 and used this technique accessed approximately $99,000 in home equity. The top 10th percentile unlocked a median of $337,000.\n\nThe average homeowner who is at least 60 years old has about $223,000 of retirement savings in their financial accounts. That, alone, isn’t considered to be enough to retire on so many are starting to plan for the use of their home equity as part of their retirement plan.\n\nThe example provided by Vanguard looks at a woman who purchased a home near Boston in the 1990s for $170,000. That home would now have an approximate value of $500,000. After selling the home, relocating and buying a smaller home in her new location, she’s able to unlock about $200,000 on the capital gains from selling her house.\n\nThe key to unlocking these funds is that she must move to a location with a much more affordable housing market so that she doesn’t have to pay rent. This may not be an option for some who have family obligations tying them to their current location. However, for many this is quickly becoming a way to nearly double their retirement funds.\n\nTwo Types of Retirement Relocators\n\nThere are two types of retirement relocators that can find success with this strategy. The first is those who move from a booming housing market (lottery winners) and those who move to a low-growth housing market (bargain hunters). Each strategy creates different values for the homeowner but it also opens up different opportunities.",

    "fullText": "SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Jan 27 (Reuters) - With gold prices setting new all-time highs this week, customers have been cramming into stores in Shanghai and Hong Kong that sell the precious metal, with some betting the ​price could rise even further.\n\n\"There are still quite a lot of people buying it, because gold awareness is a long‑term trend ‌and it’s still heading upwards,\" gold seller Zhao Jinhao said on Tuesday at a jewellery mall in Shanghai.\n\n\"It’s risen from just over 20 yuan back in the 1980s to more ‌than a thousand yuan now, and it has been on an upward trajectory the whole time.\"\n\nGold prices surpassed $5,100 per ounce on Monday after a 62% surge in 2025. The record-breaking run has been propelled by central bank buying to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar and strong demand across the board from buyers looking for a safe-haven asset after the tumultuous first year of U.S. President Donald Trump's second presidency.\n\nAnalysts at Societe Generale said on Monday they expect ⁠to see gold reach $6,000/oz by year-end, a forecast ‌they said was conservative because prices could well go higher.\n\nSixty-eight-year-old Shanghai resident Wang Qiuqin appeared to agree, saying the \"crazy\" rise in prices had spurred her to visit a gold store to make a purchase.\n\n\"If this keeps up, gold ‍is still likely to go higher. I can still mentally accept the current price level, so I decided to come buy some.\"\n\nIn Hong Kong, Simon Littmann, the executive manager of Swiss Investors Corporation Limited, which trades in precious metals such as gold and silver, said business in January this year was his best ever in ​around 20 years in the trade.\n\n“Last year was probably our second-busiest year, and this year is looking to get very busy, but we ‌have supply problems,\" he said.\n\nThe supply of small gold bars has been delayed due to strong demand and as refineries around the globe rush to boost production of the products for the retail sector, he added.\n\nWhile many others are also not deterred — China's central bank bought bullion each month last year — higher prices are still having an effect on demand. Wholesale gold demand in China fell 11% last year as higher prices and reforms that raised taxes weighed on jewelry demand despite more interest in investment-style bars and coins.\n\nRecord prices are leading others to cash in. Dozens of ⁠people queued outside the door of the Chong Kee gold shop in Hong Kong’s ​central business district on Tuesday waiting for the chance to trade in gold and ​silver. Some had to wait hours to enter the premises, where they had trinkets like bracelets, necklaces, small statuettes and bars put onto scales to be weighed.",

    "description": "Scientists say grooves on a rock face overlooking the Adriatic Sea may have been made by sea turtles fleeing an earthquake.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nRock climbers in Italy stumbled across evidence of what appears to be a sea turtle stampede that took place nearly 80 million years ago. Now, new research suggests these ancient marine reptiles were fleeing an earthquake.\n\nThe climbers recognized the significance of their find because the grooves in the rock face on Monte Cònero overlooking the Adriatic Sea reminded them of others that had made headlines earlier that year. Those grooves had been found in another part of the same regional park and were attributed to a Cretaceous marine reptile pressing its paddles into the seafloor. They consulted with fellow-climber and geologist, Paolo Sandroni, who got in touch with Alessandro Montanari, director of the Coldigioco Geological Observatory (OGC).\n\nAfter an investigation into what these grooves might be, researchers revealed their findings in a study published Nov. 19 in the journal Cretaceous Research.\n\nSandroni and another member of the team climbed back to the area to collect rock samples and document the site using a drone.\n\nHundreds of these tracks are located on a layer of the Scaglia Rossa limestone in Cònero Regional Park, a formation that has been extensively studied for decades and preserves millions of years of deep sea sedimentation, study co-author Montanari told Live Science.\n\nWhat is now part of a mountain was once a deep seabed folded over and thrust upward by tectonic forces millions of years ago, he said. Rock samples collected immediately above the tracks and analyzed by the team reveal important clues about the tracks’ location and the story behind them. For example, they suggest the sea turtles lived around 79 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous Period and indicate that the limestone was part of an underwater avalanche of mud triggered by an earthquake.\n\nAbundant seismic activity in this formation is also supported by decades of collective study. Thin sections slides of the rock samples reveal microfossils of organisms that live along the seafloor, suggesting a hundreds-of-meters deep seafloor environment.\n\nNormally, any traces left by animals would be erased by currents at the sea bottom and \"worms, clams and [other] benthic organisms,\" Montanari said. \"They basically garden the seafloor,\" he noted. But an earthquake caused an underwater avalanche within minutes of the tracks being made, preserving them, he said.\n\nThe only vertebrates big enough to make these tracks in the Late Cretaceous were marine reptiles such as sea turtles, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs. The latter two are believed to have been largely solitary, but, if ancient sea turtle behavior mirrored that of some of today's species, the researchers said, then it is possible they may have foraged near shore or left the water to lay their eggs. Whatever brought them together, an earthquake caused them all to flee at once, the team suggested in the study, forcing some of the turtles to swim in the water above toward the open sea, and others to scurry away closer to the deeper seafloor. The impending underwater avalanche propelled them even further out of the way.\n\n—Titanic 12-foot turtle cruised the ocean 80 million years ago, newfound fossils show\n\n—Giant 'cow of the Cretaceous' discovered almost 100 years ago identified as new duck-billed dinosaur\n\n—Ancient mummified cheetahs discovered in Saudi Arabia contain preserved DNA from the long-lost population\n\nMichael Benton, professor of vertebrate palaeontology at the University of Bristol in the U.K., who was not involved in the research, said the study clearly shows the geological context, but he questioned which animal made the tracks.\n\n\"The tracks are unusual because they seem to show underwater punting, where the two forelimbs enter the sediment together and the animal pushes forward,\" he told Live Science. Most vertebrates tend to “walk or swim with the limbs out of sequence” rather than putting two limbs down at the same time, he said. \"Marine turtles generally have a very efficient swimming mode,\" he said, “a bit like underwater flying, where the front paddles swing round” similar to a figure eight pattern, which doesn’t appear to match the tracks found. He also questions why they wouldn't simply \"leave the sea bed and swim\" away.\n\nMontanari said that while the prints would benefit from further research, it is clear, geologically, that there was an underwater avalanche triggered by an earthquake. He said he hopes their work will prompt fossil experts to further study the site.",

I know what we did and didn’t do for these (expletive).”\n\nBongino then cited a New York Times article, which included interviews with several current and former employees who accused Director of the FBI Kash Patel of making America less safe.\n\n“Do you dipwads even read your own headlines?” Bongino said. “Are you that stupid?\n\n“These are these media morons — people who’ve never spent a day wearing a badge. Never kicked in a door. Never arrested some child predator or some bank robber or some gang member. These morons don’t know anything about the safety status of the country,\" Bongino said.\n\nBongino said the media is a “big, full diaper,” adding that he is “tired of these idiots.”\n\n“What freaking country are these morons living in?” Bongino asked. “I mean, what are they looking at? Are they missing this stuff? These are not small items. That isn’t even — forget — I haven’t even gotten to Maduro being out of power, the Cuban leadership’s crapping their pants, we may acquire portions of Greenland.\"\n\nHannity then commented by saying that the “real Dan Bongino is back,” observing he was more restrained when he held a government title.\n\n“We’ve been friends for a long time,” Hannity said. “I kind of like the real Dan being back, unfiltered.”\n\nSuffolk DA on Minneapolis: ICE’s, Border Patrol’s tactics ‘threaten citizens everywhere’\n\n‘Nasty profession’: Trump reveals why he skewers people in public he thinks are ‘nice’\n\nTrump calls vocal critic ‘incompetent’ as 2028 presidential race heats up\n\nMass.

    "fullText": "A professional python hunter in Florida needed assistance from family members to uncoil a giant Burmese python from his body and to ultimately subdue the second-heaviest python ever caught in Florida.\n\nCarl Jackson, who is a contracted python hunter with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, was traveling back on Turner River Road in Big Cypress National Park in the afternoon on Jan. 13 when he noticed Burmese python tracks across the road over his truck tracks, as reported by Naples News.\n\nThey appeared to be tracks from a smaller snake, perhaps an 8-footer, tops.\n\n“I go in [to the bushes] and walk around and I see a head,” Jackson told Naples News.\n\nHe immediately recognized that this was not a small snake.\n\nJackson began wrestling with the huge python, which dragged him an estimated 10 to 15 feet over a red and black ant hill.\n\n“It was like riding a slow horse,” Jackson, 43, told Naples News.\n\nJackson relied upon his team to uncoil the snake from around his body several times. His team included his wife, Tasha, and adopted kids, Ryker Young, 20, and Jazzlyn Bateman, 16, all of whom just the day before became certified assistants in the FWC’s Python Action Team, Removing Invasive Constrictors program.\n\nThe python wound up being the second-heaviest python ever caught in Florida at 202 pounds. The record is 215 pounds caught in 2022.\n\nJackson’s python was a 16-foot, 10-inch female, which had been carrying 200 eggs.\n\nAlso on FTW Outdoors: Woman awakes to find python on her chest, ‘don’t move’\n\n“That means more to me because that is 200 potential deer and native animal eaters [that were eliminated],” Jackson told Naples News.\n\nSince moving from Utah to hunt pythons last year, Jackson has eliminated 91 pythons, including the longest one among the contracted hunters in 2025—a 17-foot, 10-inch python.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Python drags hunter 15 feet over ant hill; ‘like riding a slow horse’",

    "description": "A “vulnerable” young man with no terminal illnesses has died by euthanasia in Canada.",
    "fullText": "A “vulnerable” young man with no terminal illnesses has died by euthanasia in Canada.\n\nKiano Vafaeian, 26, had type 1 diabetes, partial blindness and depression, but was approved for the government euthanasia scheme despite his mother Margaret Marsilla’s protests.\n\nShe said his death on Dec 30 was “disgusting on every level”, having previously prevented him from dying under Canada’s Medical Assistance in Dying (MAid) programme in 2022.\n\nMs Marsilla only learned of her son’s appointment from a text he sent the family the day before his death, during an apparent improvement in his mental health.\n\nAlthough people with a chronic illness or disability qualify for assisted dying in Canada, Ms Marsilla believes doctors took advantage of his depression.\n\nShe wrote in a social media post earlier this month: “This is not healthcare. This is a failure of ethics, accountability, and humanity.\n\n“No parent should ever have to bury their child because a system – and a doctor – chose death over care, help or love.\n\n“I promise I will fight tooth and nail for my son, and other parents who too have children that suffer from mental illness.”\n\nEuthanasia was introduced in Canada in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with serious and incurable physical illness that causes intolerable suffering.\n\nIn 2021, the requirement to be terminally ill was removed to include people with a chronic illness or disability.\n\nThe widening of eligibility has led to a surge in deaths, experts say, triggering fears of a similar increase in the UK, where a bill on assisted dying is being debated in the House of Lords.\n\nCanada now has one of the highest rates of assisted dying in the world, accounting for one in 20 of all deaths in the country in 2024, government figures show.\n\nIn 2027, the government plans to extend the programme to those with mental illnesses, who have no physical ailment.\n\nIn September 2022, Ms Marsilla had discovered that her son had been scheduled for physician-assisted dying. The then 23-year-old had recently lost vision in one eye, had no job, and no plan for the future.\n\nAfter she raised awareness about the planned procedure online, the doctor received backlash and refused to carry out the procedure. Vafaeian said his mother had violated his right to choose how and when he wanted to die.\n\n“He was alive because people stepped in when he was vulnerable – not capable of making a final, irreversible decision,” Ms Marsilla said of the incident.\n\nShe also claims Vafaeian’s mental health was improving before his death. She said he had agreed to accept financial support from her, was saving money for them to travel together, and had done personal training sessions.\n\n“He was so happy that he was working out and getting healthy,” she said.\n\nOn Dec 15, Vafaeian flew to a luxury resort in Mexico, before checking out two nights later and flying to Vancouver. On Dec 29, he texted his family saying he was scheduled to die the next day.\n\nMs Marsilla said that she planned to pursue accountability from her son’s MAiD doctor, who she claimed had managed to find a loophole in the system and had “approved his death based on mental illness”, despite it not yet being legal.\n\nVafaeian’s death certificate listed the “antecedent causes” as blindness, severe peripheral neuropathy (damage to nerves that causes pain and numbness), and diabetes.\n\nDespite a host of Western countries legalising assisted dying, including Australia, Belgium, Spain and Switzerland, the issue remains deeply divisive on ethical, religious and legal grounds.\n\nThe key debate centres around how to balance personal autonomy with the protection of vulnerable people.\n\nBritish medical bodies have raised significant concerns about the definition of “terminal illness” and safeguards to prevent coercion in the current bill. In November, a poll found more medical professionals oppose than support the draft legislation.\n\nThe fastest growing category of Canada’s assisted dying is not those with a terminal illness, but those labelled “other”.\n\nSonu Gaind, a University of Toronto psychiatry professor, told the Free Press that MAiD deaths registered in the “other” category in Canada nearly doubled between 2022 and 2023 to 4,255.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "CBS News boss Bari Weiss told staffers they are not putting out enough content that appeals to Americans — while also sharing her strategy to grab more viewers and readers — during an internal town hall meeting on Tuesday.\n\nCNN’s Brian Stelter posted her comments on X. Weiss was frank in her assessment of her team, saying CBS News can only improve after “honestly” looking at its own work — which she is not overly impressed with so far.\n\n“We are not producing a product that enough people want,” Weiss said.\n\nShe continued, “We can blame demographics or technology or fractured attention spans or ‘news avoidance’ — but these are all copes.”\n\nHere, in three posts, are the written remarks by Bari Weiss at today's CBS News town hall meeting. Part one of three: pic.twitter.com/sLxfVeFkVW\n\n— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) January 27, 2026\n\nWeiss said she has been “blown away” by many of her reporters recently, including Matt Gutman’s work covering anti-ICE protests in Minnesota.\n\nBut she said there are two main issues facing CBS right now, with the first one being that not enough people “trust” the outlet or other mainstream shops in general. The polling backs up her claim, with Gallup reporting the American public’s trust in the news dropped to an all-time low in 2025.\n\nThe second issue is CBS is not “doing enough to meet” viewers and readers where they are, Weiss said.\n\nShe said the CBS strategy up until she arrived was to “cling” to its dwindling broadcast audience. Weiss said that cannot be the case moving forward, or CBS News will be “toast.”\n\nStarting immediately, Weiss wants CBS News to focus on how it can better promote stories on YouTube and emphasize streaming. “We need to shift to a streaming mentality immediately,” she said.\n\nA moment later, she told her crew:\n\nAs we move forward, we are not competing primarily for ratings but for audience share. Our competitors are not just the other broadcast networks. We are competing for the attention of anyone in front of a screen.\n\nHer streaming-focused game plan comes after CBS News finished third in the nightly news battle last year. Weiss recently picked Tony Dokoupil to spearhead its revamped CBS Evening News; his first week as anchor failed to boost ratings earlier this month, but his January 19 broadcast pulled in 6.4 million viewers — which was the best night for the program since 2021.\n\nThe post Bari Weiss Bluntly Tells CBS News Staff ‘We Are Not Producing a Product Enough People Want’ in Blistering Internal Town Hall first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but ​distanced herself from previous comments that suggested a possible military response in such an event.\n\nTakaichi expressed ‌her latest views on a nationally broadcast TV programme late on Monday, where an opposition party leader criticised her for igniting ‌tensions with China with the earlier remarks.\n\nTies between Japan and China have sunk to the worst level in years after Takaichi said in November that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. Beijing has responded with export curbs, flight cancellations and vitriolic commentaries, repeatedly demanding a retraction.\n\nChina claims sovereignty ⁠over the democratically-governed island of Taiwan.\n\n“I ‌want to make it absolutely clear that this is not about Japan going out and taking military action if China and the United States come into conflict (over ‍Taiwan),\" Takaichi said on the live TV show, referring to the comments she made in parliament in November.\n\n\"If something serious happens there, we would have to go to rescue the Japanese and American citizens in Taiwan. In that situation, ​there may be cases where we take joint action.\n\n\"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, ‌come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nJAPAN'S CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS DIRECT MILITARY ACTION\n\nWith an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the ⁠remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with ​Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of ​her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday urged Japan to \"earnestly reflect and correct its mistakes, and to stop its manipulation and reckless actions on ‍the Taiwan issue.\"\n\nJapan's pacifist constitution ⁠prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces ⁠a \"threat to its survival.\"\n\nTakaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election ‌on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.",

Both Meyer and his wife suffered gunshot wounds but survived.\n\nThe Lafayette Police Department, the FBI, the Indiana State Police and the Purdue University Police Department launched a search for the shooter that went on for days before apprehending five people in synchronized arrests Thursday evening, including four in Indiana and one in Lexington, Kentucky. Court appearances for the suspects were set for Wednesday in Indiana and Kentucky.\n\n“This attack was more than an assault on two citizens,” LaFayette Police Chief Scott Galloway said. “This was an assault on the rule of law itself.”\n\nProsecutors allege that the attack was designed to derail a domestic abuse case against Thomas Moss, a member of the Detroit-based Phantom MC motorcycle club with ties to the Vice Lords street gang.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit, the Vice Lords offered the victim in the case $10,000 not to testify against Moss but she refused.\n\nWith Moss' trial set to begin on Jan. 20 in front of Meyer, another Phantom MC member, Blake Smith, purchased a shotgun. A masked man traveled to the Meyers' home armed with that shotgun on Jan. 18. He lured the couple to the door by saying he was looking for his dog, shot them through the door and fled.\n\n“(Meyer) was targeted,” Indiana State Police Lt. Col. Al Williamson said at Tuesday's news conference. “They went after him for a reason.”\n\nPolice recovered the mask, the shooter's clothing and the shotgun discarded near the Meyers' home. DNA on the mask matched Raylen Ferguson, an associate of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation from Lexington, Kentucky, according to the affidavit.\n\nSurveillance video showed a car that was parked near the Meyers' home had traveled from Kentucky toward Lafayette on Jan. 16 and traveled toward Smith's residence in the hour after the shootings, according to the affidavit.\n\nMoss, Ferguson and Smith each face multiple charges, including attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Amanda Milsap, whom prosecutors allege offered the bribe in the domestic abuse case, faces bribery and obstruction counts. Zeneda Greer, a woman Ferguson lives with, has been charged with helping a criminal and obstruction. Prosecutors have accused her of traveling to Lafayette with Ferguson.\n\nMilsap's attorney, Earl McCoy, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Online court records did not list attorneys for Moss, Ferguson or Blake. Jail records indicate Greer is being held in Lexington. Online court records in that state did not list an attorney for her.",

    "fullText": "Ray Dalio warned the U.S. stands “on the brink” of transitioning from Stage 5 pre-breakdown to Stage 6 systemic collapse as Bitcoin is trading defensively at $88,000, trapped in a 60-day range by record institutional selling pressure from American counterparties.\n\nThe billionaire investor’s latest analysis of the “Big Cycle” coincides with Bitcoin’s failure to live up to its “digital gold” narrative, while traditional safe havens surge to all-time highs.\n\nDalio’s framework identifies bankrupt government finances and wealth gaps as the “single most reliable leading indicator of civil war or revolution,” conditions he argues now characterize American reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Wintermute’s desk reports that Bitcoin remains stuck between $85,000 and $94,000 as U.S. spot ETF products hemorrhage capital and the Coinbase premium trades at a persistent discount, indicating that domestic institutions are driving bearish momentum.\n\nDalio’s long essay positions current American conditions within Stage 5 of his Big Cycle framework, where “bad financial conditions and intense conflict” precede systemic breakdown.\n\n“We are now clearly on the brink of crossing from Stage 5 (pre-breakdown) to Stage 6 (breakdown),” he wrote, pointing to unsustainable debt loads that force governments to either “print a lot of money, which depreciates its value” or implement painful austerity.\n\nThe analysis comes as Bitcoin trades range-bound for 60 consecutive days, an unusual pattern for an asset class often marketed as protection against exactly the monetary debasement Dalio describes.\n\nGold climbed above $5,066 per ounce on Tuesday while silver surged 6.4% to $110.60, both setting fresh records as investors sought traditional inflation hedges.\n\nDalio warned that “later stages may involve capital controls, reserve freezes, and cross-border restrictions, turning funds into political tools,” conditions that typically favor “freely transferable assets” and investments “prioritizing resistance to freezing and blockades.“\n\nBitcoin proponents have long argued that crypto fits this profile, yet the asset has failed to attract safe-haven flows amid elevated macro uncertainty.\n\nWintermute’s OTC desk identified American selling pressure as the primary force keeping Bitcoin suppressed within its trading range.",

Ileana Garcia (R), co-founder of Latinas for Trump, blasted President Trump’s immigration crackdown, warning he “will lose the midterms” because of White House adviser Stephen Miller.\n\n“I do think that he will lose the midterms because of Stephen Miller,” Garcia told The New York Times in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nThough Garcia was openly supportive of Trump’s plans to close the border, she placed blame on Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, for the aggressive tactics used during the current crackdown.\n\nHer comments come after federal agents in Minneapolis over the weekend shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti amid a protest against the administration’s immigration action, weeks after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the city earlier this month.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti “attacked” federal law enforcement, while Miller described Pretti as “a would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday distanced Trump from those remarks, saying she had not heard the president “characterize Mr. Pretti in that way” and deferring to the investigation.\n\n“Distorting, politicizing, slandering – justifying what happened to Alex Pretti contradicts the American values the administration campaigned on.  He was neither a domestic terrorist nor an assassin,” Garcia wrote in a Monday post on the social platform X, responding to Miller’s characterization of the incident.\n\n“Allowing individuals like Stephen Miller, among others, who represent the government and make hard-line decisions, to make such comments will have long term consequences. … This is not what I voted for!” she continued.\n\nGarcia, who rallied support from Latina voters to help get Trump elected in 2016 and served in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security during his first term, has blasted what she last year called “inhumane” tactics to meet deportation goals.\n\nHer comments mark the latest sign of growing frustration with Trump’s immigration handling as fallout from the Minnesota shootings grows, as observers warn the issue could have a lingering impact on November’s high-stakes midterms.",

    "fullText": "Four children who were allegedly abducted by their mother from Utah have been located at an orphanage in Croatia, according to their family\n\nLandon Seymour, 11, Levi Parker Seymour, 8, Hazel Raye Seymour, 7, and 3-year-old Jacob Kurt Brady disappeared following a Thanksgiving visit with their mother Elleshia Anne Seymour\n\nElleshia, 35, was arrested in the Croatian city of Dubrovnik, local authorities say\n\nThe four Utah children who disappeared after spending Thanksgiving with their mother have been located at an orphanage in Croatia, and the mom has been arrested.\n\nElleshia Anne Seymour, 35, was already facing charges in Utah after she allegedly abducted her four children and fled on a one-way flight to Europe on Nov. 29, 2025, PEOPLE previously reported.\n\nSeymour's ex-husband Kendall Seymour identified the children in a GoFundMe as Landon Seymour, 11, Levi Parker Seymour, 8, Hazel Raye Seymour, 7, and 3-year-old Jacob Kurt Brady.\n\nOn Sunday, Jan. 25, Kendall shared an update on the fundraiser that the children are “trapped” at a state-run orphanage. Kendall is the father to three of the four children.\n\nElleshia was arrested in Dubrovnik, about 400 miles from the Croatian capital of Zagreb, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed to DNEVNIK, a leading local news agency, on Monday, Jan. 26.\n\nAnother local outlet, 24 Sata, also reported on the arrest, citing a statement from the ministry, although the ministry did not name the woman in its statement.\n\nElleshia was arrested in connection with a criminal case involving violation of the rights of a child, the outlets reported.\n\nPEOPLE has reached out to the ministry as well as the U.S. embassy in Croatia for confirmation.\n\nThe children's alleged abduction came to light following a welfare check on Dec. 2, when West Jordan Police Department arrived at Elleshia's residence and found it unoccupied and unlocked, ABC4 Utah previously reported, citing court records.\n\nElleshia, who shares custody with the fathers of her children, allegedly feared it was the “end of times” and had concerns of \"biblical events,\" a former boyfriend previously told KSL Utah.\n\n“I didn't really know anything about her end-of-times beliefs until after this all happened,” ex-husband Kendall further told the outlet. “It didn't come up in our marriage or after our divorce.”\n\nIn the GoFundMe, Kendall alleged that Elleshia \"left behind a note dictating a delusional message from God promising her she would be in Italy by Christmas, and a to-do list that mentioned 'shred paperwork, destroy identifying photos, throw away phone, purchase pre-paid phone.'\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the children have been removed from the orphanage.\n\nDespite Kendall's online pleas to return the children back to the U.S., the Croatian Institute for Social Work has called for a thorough review of the case, 24 Sata, DNEVNIK and Teleskop reported.\n\n\"Given the international element of the case, it is essential that the competent authorities of the United States of America conduct a review of all relevant facts and circumstances before making a decision to hand over the children to the father,\" the institute said in a statement.\n\nPEOPLE has reached out to the institute for comments.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nIn Utah, Elleshia is facing four counts of custodial interference, local authorities said, per KSL and ABC4 Utah.\n\nWhile the case began with the West Jordan Police, it was transferred to the FBI. Both the FBI and West Jordan police declined to comment on the investigation.\n\nThe case is now being passed on to Croatian police, local officials further told KSL. It wasn't immediately clear if the FBI is still investigating.\n\nOther entities, such as Croatia's foreign affairs office, the U.S. consulate in Croatia, and the Utah Department of Public Safety, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comments.\n\nKendall is seeking further donations on GoFundMe to help him cover travel costs while continuing to stay in Croatia as he tries to release the children.\n\nIf you suspect child abuse, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child or 1-800-422-4453, or go to www.childhelp.org. All calls are toll-free and confidential. The hotline is available 24/7 in more than 170 languages.",
