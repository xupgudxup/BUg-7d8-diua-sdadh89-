Follow here for live updates as our national recruiting team breaks down who is standing out among the elite prospects in the senior and junior classes.\n\nFULL 2026 Under Armour All-America Game roster breakdown\n\nJoin the discussion on the Rivals recruiting board here.\n\n7:30 p.m. ET: “Ohio State four-star LB signee Cincere Johnson flying downhill to blow up a play at the mesh point. He’s been quite active during the full team period for Team Pearls.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n7:25 p.m. ET: “LSU Five-Star Plus+ signee Lamar Brown gets in the backfield and stops 2027 LSU four-star QB commit Peyton Houston.” — Charles Power\n\n7:22 p.m. ET: “Rivals’ No. 1 prospect in 2027 Texas Tech five-star DL commit Jalen Brewster just hawked down BYU QB signee Ryder Lyons escaping pressure. He ran stride for stride with him for 15 yards. Absolutely insane.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n7:20 p.m. ET: Maryland Five-Star Plus+ EDGE signee Zion Elee corrals 2027 LSU four-star QB commit Peyton Houston in 11-on-11. Nice speed off the edge by Elee. 2027 four-star RB Tranard Roberts is down with what looked to be a non-contact injury.” — Charles Power\n\n7:15 p.m. ET: “Notre Dame 2026 QB commit Teddy Jarrard hits a streaking 2027 Texas five-star WR commit Easton Royal for a long gain. Alabama five-star safety signee Jireh Edwards in coverage.” — Charles Power\n\nNotre Dame 2026 QB commit Teddy Jarrard hits a streaking Texas WR commit Easton Royal for a long gain.

Alabama wins over LSU signee. Cornerback Censere Gaylord, an IMG academy 2027 talent, has been impressive in coverage.” — Marcus Benjamin\n\n7:10 p.m. ET: “Nice zip by 2027 Illinois four-star QB commit Kamden Lopati over the middle of the field to Eric McFarland who has a bunch of juice with the ball in his hands. McFarland recently reclassified up to the 2027 cycle.” — Charles Power\n\nIllinois 2027 4-star QB commit Kamden Lopati hits elite WR Eric McFarland for a big gain\n\nvia @CodyBellaire\n\nLive Updates: https://t.co/ivQCdyAPIZpic.twitter.com/00DodA9EYU\n\n— Rivals (@Rivals) January 1, 2026\n\n7:00 p.m. ET: “Moving out of position drills into the group period. Team Pearls doing some 7on7: BYU four-star QB signee Ryder Lyons targets Illinois RB signee Javari Barnett on a wheel route, but Barnett doesn’t turn around for the ball … 2027 Illinois four-star QB commit Kamden Lopati hits 2027 four-star WR Trenton Yancey on a comeback … 2027 four-star CB Hayden Stepp with good coverage of 2027 four-star WR Lawrence Britt downfield…\n\nRyder Lyons hits Tyreek King, a four-star WR signed to Tennessee, on the sideline. Lyons later hits 2027 four-star WR Kesean Bowman on a pretty ball downfield. Bowman makes a high point grab over Florida State four-star safety commit Mekhi Williams. Lyons misses high on the next throw.” — Charles Power\n\n6:55 p.m. ET: “Five-Star Plus+ prospect Mark Matthews, the top-ranked offensive tackle in the 2027 class, is practicing at left guard and right tackle. Maryland Five-Star Plus+ EDGE signee Zion Elee is a monster off the edge. Really explosive.” — Marcus Benjamin\n\n6:40 p.m. ET: “2027 Ohio State four-star safety commit Eli Johnson looks the part among the Team Roses DB group. The largest of the group and a smooth, twitchy mover in drills.” — Charles Power\n\n6:20 p.m. ET: “Lamar Brown, the No. 1 overall prospect in the 2026 cycle, will be one we’re excited to see perform in this setting. The LSU signee played more snaps along the defensive front this year, but he’s still green in terms of reps.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n6:07 p.m. ET: “On the hoof, Team Roses has an absolutely LOADED receiver group. Freaky looking body types and movement skills out of that group of pass-catchers. Players like USC four-star signee Boobie Feaster, 2027 five-star Texas commit Easton Royal and 2027 four-star WR Julian Caldwell standout physically and with their movement skills.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n6:05 p.m. ET: “2027 four-star wide receiver Lawrence Britt, the No. 17 WR in the junior cycle, flashing some soft hands early.” — Chad Simmons\n\n5:52 p.m. ET: “BYU four-star QB signee Ryder Lyons is here and throwing. He was hurt late in his senior season, so good to see him back at full go. He’s the top 2026 QB in attendance with the bulk of the signal-callers being from the 2027 cycle.” — Charles Power\n\n5:42 p.m. ET: “2027 Five-Star Plus+ OT Mark Matthews is one of the more well-built OL of the group. Five-star Ohio State DL signee Khary Wilder is on the leaner side and is one who could be more of a DE, at least to start. Five-star LSU DL signee Richard Anderson looks to have trimmed down a bit during the season. 2027 five-star Texas Tech DL commit Jalen Brewster is a lean 300-pounder, he carries the weight well.” — Charles Power\n\n5-star LSU DL signee Richard Anderson going through warmups @UANextFootball https://t.co/SPi7l0kR1A pic.twitter.com/xCiIJnPi0o\n\n— Charles Power (@CharlesPower) December 31, 2025\n\n5:33 p.m. ET: “Oregon five-star TE signee Kendre’ Harrison immediately passes the eye test and stands out within the group. LSU Five-Star Plus+ lineman signee Lamar Brown stands out from a size and build perspective. The same can be said for 2027 Texas A&M four-star safety commit Kamarui Dorsey.” — Charles Power\n\n5:33 p.m. ET: “Temperature for tonight’s practice in Orlando is hovering right around 50°, could dip into the 40s later with slight wind but generally just a colder night out here.” — Cody Bellaire\n\n5:25 p.m. ET: “Practice is set to start around 5:45. First guy out was Oklahoma four-star EDGE signee Jake Kreul, and he flashed Horns down as soon as he saw the camera.” — Chad Simmons",

    "description": "The games will have a break per half.",
    "fullText": "FIFA has had “cooling breaks” for a while now to give players some time to hydrate when the temperature during a match is excesive. This started during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, when a Brazilian court ordered FIFA breaks near the 30th minute mark for the players to hydrate when temperatures reached 32 degrees Celsius (via ESPN).\n\nSince then, certain leagues such as the MLS and Spanish LaLiga have adopted similar breaks, with each league using different parameters for the interruption of play.\n\nNow, per a report from The Athletic’s Henry Bushnell, the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup will feature ‘three-minute hydration breaks’ in each half of every game:\n\nIn 2026, for the first time at a World Cup, they’ll pause no matter what, around 22 minutes into each half.\n\n“There will be no weather or temperature condition in place, with the breaks being called by the referee in all games, to ensure equal conditions for all teams, in all matches,” FIFA said in a release posted online late Sunday night.\n\nThe report also mentions that the breaks have commercial implications, which can surely be translated as an opportunity for FIFA to sell pricey ad spots to increase the World Cup revenue — something which might not surprise anyone at this point.",

    "title": "Packers awarded former All-Pro CB Trevon Diggs on waivers",
    "description": "The Green Bay Packers actually did the thing. Welcome Trevon Diggs to the team.",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers will get a reinforcement ahead of the playoffs. On Wednesday, the Packers were awarded cornerback Trevon Diggs after he was waived by the Dallas Cowboys on Tuesday, reportedly for staying back in his hometown of Washington after Christmas despite the team denying his request.\n\nAs we covered earlier in the week, Diggs has been about an average cornerback this year, but he’s historically had more production on the ball than the Packers’ group of cornerbacks. On top of that, Green Bay has already placed Kamal Hadden on the injured reserve after his injury last week and fellow cornerback Nate Hobbs appears to be banged up, too, all while Bo Melton has exclusively played receiver, not cornerback, this year. In short, the Packers were down on cornerback bodies going into the playoffs, which is why the team promoted two from their practice squad to the 53-man roster on Tuesday.\n\nDiggs has a lot of ties to Green Bay. First of all, he was recruited to Alabama by Packers passing game coordinator Derrick Ansley. He’s also very close with fellow Dallas Cowboys Micah Parsons. Parsons, along with quarterback Jordan Love and safety Xavier McKinney, shares the same agent as Diggs, Athletes First’s David Mulugheta. McKinney also played with Diggs at Alabama, and head coach Matt LaFleur is also represented by Athletes First.\n\nThe addition of Diggs will cost the Packers about half a million in cap space, but now, at minimum, they’ll have a non-practice squadder available to play in the playoffs if either Keisean Nixon or Carrington Valentine end up going down.\n\nAll of Diggs’ guarantees have expired, meaning his addition is functionally just for the end of this season. The Packers will likely release (or restructure) Diggs by the start of the 2026 new league year.\n\nGreen Bay had an open roster spot on the 53-man roster before this move, so there was no corresponding move that needed to be made. The Packers also had an open practice squad spot going into today, which they used to sign quarterback Desmond Ridder, a third-round pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nThere’s been a bunch of stats thrown out there, so I wanted to update the bottom of this post with what I think is the most important stat for cornerbacks: Adjusted yards allowed per coverage snap.\n\nThe graph above plots all 429 seasons in which outside cornerbacks have played as many snaps as 2025 Trevon Diggs since 2020 (when he entered the league). Highlighted are all of Diggs’ seasons since then and qualifying Green Bay Packers seasons since 2020.\n\nAdjusted yards allowed per coverage snap is like yards allowed per coverage snap, but it treats a surrendered touchdown as a bonus of 20 yards given up (on top of the pure yardage) and an interception caught as wiping out 45 yards. Why treat touchdown and interception values like this? Because it’s much more correlated to wins than passer rating.\n\nI have my own issues with passer rating, but I think it’s particularly dumb to use it to evaluate seasons that cornerbacks have had. For example, if a cornerback surrenders one reception on one target for eight yards over 50 coverage snaps, he would have surrendered a 100.0 passer rating for the game, a terrible rate. If you used adjusted yards allowed per coverage snap, though, eight yards given up on 50 coverage snaps is just 0.16, a great score.\n\nUltimately, a cornerback’s job is to prevent yardage being given up, targeted or not, not just to be efficient when targeted.\n\nEither way, Diggs had a pretty significant drop-off between 2024 and 2025. Maybe a new home is what he needed to bounce back. With that being said, both Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine (who were above the NFL average in 2024) have also been in a slump this year, in part because everyone not named Micah Parsons has struggled to impact opposing quarterbacks.",

In that stretch, Nebraska was 0 of 6 on third down.\n\nThe Utes found themselves down 14-7 going into the second quarter after giving up two long Nebraska drives that were powered by the Huskers’ rushing attack.\n\nUtah, though, took control of the contest in the second quarter, when it outscored Nebraska 17-0 and outgained the Huskers 198 yards to 17.\n\nThat helped Utah build up 300 yards of total offense in the first half.\n\nThat set the tone for a dominant third quarter as well, when the Utes tacked on two more touchdowns.\n\nUtah had 138 yards of total offense in the third — 73 rushing and 65 passing — and took a 37-14 lead into the final quarter.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWith less than 30 hours remaining before the transfer portal officially opens, Deion Sanders and the Colorado Buffaloes absorbed one of their most significant blows of the cycle.\n\nTrue freshman edge rusher London Merritt is moving on.\n\nThe timing alone made the loss sting. The substance made it heavier.\n\nMerritt didn’t redshirt. He didn’t wait for an opportunity. He played in all 12 games as a freshman, carving out a role in the rotation immediately. At 6-foot-3, 250 pounds, the Atlanta native finished the season with 25 total tackles, eight tackles for loss, and a sack, production that only hinted at the disruption he consistently created off the edge. He earned PFF All-Freshman honors and a Big 12 honorable mention, rare recognition for a first-year defender adjusting to Power Four football on the fly.\n\nMORE: Major shakeup hits Colorado’s quarterback room as transfer portal losses reach 23\n\nThis wasn’t a developmental flyer. Merritt was already a major part of the plan.\n\nThat made the reaction from inside the program impossible to ignore.\n\nCornerback Kole Mathis summed it up in two words, “Damn twin.” Defensive lineman Taurean Carter followed with, “Ohhhhh that’s a heartbreak.” Freshman quarterback Julian Lewis offered something quieter but more revealing, “Ts starting to hurt.”\n\nFormer Buff Tawfiq Byard, who recently entered the portal himself, added, “Love ya youngin.”\n\nMORE: Will Paul Skenes pay ‘six figures’ for one of a kind Livvy Dunne Topps autographed card\n\nThose reactions all appeared in the same place, the comments of Merritt’s own Instagram post. The news was first reported by Hayes Fawcett for On3, then shared directly by Merritt. This wasn’t secondhand churn or anonymous speculation. It was a player announcing his decision himself, with teammates processing it in real time underneath.\n\nThere’s also recruiting context that sharpens the loss. Before signing with Colorado last December, Merritt had been committed to the Ohio State Buckeyes. His flip to Boulder registered as a meaningful win at the time, a blue-chip edge prospect choosing opportunity and early playing time. One season later, that gamble had already paid off on the field.\n\nBetween NFL Draft declarations and the transfer portal, Coach Prime and the Buffaloes are now facing the task of replacing more than 30 student-athletes and counting.\n\nThe Buffaloes are losing a young, productive defender with size, validation, and upward trajectory, the exact type of player programs usually build around.\n\nWhile the portal hasn’t opened yet, the impact has already been felt in Boulder.\n\nKane Wommack says Alabama’s culture showed itself when the punches came\n\nCoach Prime reacts to Colorado defensive tackle’s concerning NFL Draft decision\n\nDeion Sanders faces harsh reality as Colorado talent floods the transfer portal\n\nHistoric first national championship sparks emotional reaction from Jamie Morrison and Aggies",

Johnson, Carolina's third-round pick from two years ago, had been a free agent since early October.\n\nThe Panthers traded up to select Johnson with the 80th overall pick of the 2023 draft.

    "description": "Rick Carlisle was pleased with the Pacers' second-half effort Wednesday but said there's been \"too much petty nonsense\" in losing streak.",
    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Though the Pacers made just 13 of 37 field goals in a 44-point second half en route to a 112-110 loss to the Magic in Wednesday's New Year's Eve matinee, coach Rick Carlisle said he saw a level of connectedness and fight he hasn't seen nearly enough of as the team has spiraled to the bottom of the NBA standings with a 10-game losing streak.\n\nCarlisle has noted in the past that there have been games when the Pacers didn't play with enough force or fire, but on Wednesday, for the first time, he mentioned seeing too many occasions when players have been motivated by personal agendas. The Magic also scored just 44 points in the second half -- though forward Paolo Banchero's driving bank shot with 7.5 seconds to go provided the game-winning score -- and Carlisle noted that the improved defense from the 68-point first half was a sign of the Pacers getting over themselves.\n\n\"The real question should be, 'Why did we give up 68 points in the first half and only 44 in the second half?'\" Carlisle said. \"That's because in the second half we played like a together team that was supporting each other and not like strangers, OK? That's how this has gotta be. We're having too much petty nonsense going on during games that needs to go away.\"\n\nCarlisle was asked if he could share any specifics about what he considered petty nonsense and said, \"No, I can't.\" He did eventually elaborate by saying what he saw in the second half what he didn't in the first, though he didn't name any names.\n\n\"We were tied together,\" Carlisle said. \"We were concerned with the play that was happening now and the play that was going to be immediately happening next and not whether we were touching the ball or getting a shot or not getting a shot. That kind of stuff. It's not what this organization is about. It's not what this team is about. It's not what this franchise is about. It's not what this ownership has stood for for more than four decades. Everything from little distractions with officials to everything else. It's just, that stuff has gotta go away. It's pretty clear our margins for error are really non-existent. We get distracted by unnecessary things that are unrelated to the urgency required in NBA basketball to move from event to event.\"\n\nCarlisle was asked how long he believes this has been an issue.\n\n\"It was an issue in the first half and it's been an issue in enough other games this year that it's a concern,\" Carlisle said. \"Look, in the second half, we showed what we're capable of and how we're capable of playing together, fighting for a crowd that is paying good money to watch us play and watch us try to win.\"\n\nCarlisle connected the \"nonsense\" to the Pacers tendency to allow big runs and swings in games. They had a significant second quarter lead but watched it slip away when they gave up a 13-0 run. That Magic spurt wasn't as devastating as some others the Pacers have allowed this year as too many of those have created holes far too big for them to dig themselves out of.\n\n\"In the first half, there were too many wild ups and downs,\" Carlisle said. \"We go on a run and get up six or eight and then they go on a 10-0 run. That kind of stuff is avoidable. It's avoidable with concentration and connectedness. OK, and we've gotta be more connected.\"\n\nGuard Andrew Nembhard and forward Aaron Nesmith -- two players who earned their stripes during the Pacers NBA Finals run in 2025 and Eastern Conference Finals run in 2024 -- were asked if they agreed with Carlisle's sentiments and if they too were seeing petty nonsense causing problems during games. Nembhard and Nesmith said they saw where Carlisle was coming from but also said that they felt like most of any complaining they were hearing during games -- whether teammates were looking for more shots, better help defense or better calls from officials -- were mostly motivated by a desire to win.\n\n\"There may have been a little petty nonsense, but I think it all comes from a good place,\" Nesmith said. \"I think our competitive spirit in this game was pretty high. Sometimes that bleeds over into disagreeing on calls or a guy's help. I think we can take some positives from that. Guys are tired of losing and I think we want to hold each other accountable to a higher standard again. I think we can do nothing but grow from that.\"\n\nNembhard ultimately said he believes most of the Pacers' interactions with each other have been positive.\n\n\"We're losing, so I think guys are naturally going to get competitive,\" Nembhard said. \"We want to win the game. We're going to pick at each other a little bit. At the end of the day, it's coming from a place of trying to win the game. I think it showed in the second half. We kind of came together and got more connected. I think that's what we have to focus on going forward.\"\n\nHowever their views might have been different from Carlisle's overall, Nembhard and Nesmith both considered the second-half level of connectivity as something to strive for even though it was more productive on one end of the floor than the other. It still ended in defeat, but it was the first time the Pacers had a chance to win the game in the final minutes since their 114-113 loss to the Knicks on Dec. 18.\n\n\"I thought we fought well,\" Nesmith said. \"I think in the past in previous games when teams go on a run, we laid down and let go of the rope a little bit. Today, we held on to the rope. We scratched and clawed and fought. We did make some tough shots and some timely shots. Those are the things we can build on going into 2026.\"\n\nDustin Dopirak covers the Pacers all season.

    "description": "This one hurts",
    "fullText": "We have a new gold medalist for “most impactful player from LSU to enter the transfer portal.”\n\nWednesday evening it was reported by Matt Zenitz that sophomore safety Dashawn Spears intends to enter the transfer portal. I say this every time a player in any sport puts their name into the portal: they can always withdraw their name if they so choose.\n\nSpears had a pseudo-breakout sophomore season. Despite sharing time with AJ Haulcy and Tamarcus Cooley, Spears played a ton in LSU’s dime packages and actually ended up being the Tigers’ second-highest graded player per PFF. This season Spears had 28 tackles, a sack, and intercepted DJ Lagway twice (including a pick-six) in LSU’s win over Florida. In two seasons, Spears has appeared in 26 games with four starts.\n\nThis one stings (pun intended as he’s a Denham Springs High Yellow Jacket) because Spears almost certainly would have been a starting safety in 2026 now that AJ Haulcy has declared for the draft. It’s also surprising Spears is intending to transfer as the entire LSU defensive staff sans Kyle Williams is returning. With Ahmad Breaux entering the portal you could understand it considering he’d be getting his third different position coach in as many years, Spears, however, would have had Corey Raymond and Jake Olsen heading into his junior season.\n\nMaybe this is a leverage play. In this new college football world, maybe Spears was looking for a bigger payday than Lane Kiffin and Billy Glasscock were willing to give. Whatever the case, this is a big time departure, and I fear that whoever LSU does add to replace Spears it will be a downgrade.",

    "description": "UCLA head coach Cori Close was frustrated with the lack of media coverage after UCLA beat Ohio State on Sunday, but postgame after UCLA's win over Penn State on Wednesday was a different story.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - No. 4 UCLA head coach Cori Close made waves Sunday after the Bruins' thrilling victory over no. 19 Ohio State with her displeasure at the lack of media coverage for the matchup of two Big Ten powerhouses.\n\nThe Bruins outlasted the Buckeyes in an 82-75 victory on the road in a return to conference play with double-digit scoring performances by five different Bruins to secure the win. But after the game, Close was met with an empty conference room and just one reporter, Benjamin Royer of the Orange County Register, over the phone to discuss the game.\n\nClose was frustrated, to say the least.\n\n\"If I'm being really blunt with you, the energy in the building was great, but having no media here at all from either team or either -- no AP, nothing, doesn't say a lot. We're the only double-ranked game out today; the only one in the country, and we had no media day today. No media here... Like for the only game that had two ranked opponents to not have more coverage over this particular game -- disappointing honestly, \" Close said after UCLA's win (via Benjamin Royer of the Orange County Register).\n\nUCLA women's bball coach Cori Close said that I (from Los Angeles, not in Columbus), was the only media member to to talk with her after UCLA's win vs OSU. Close said she didn't mind if I printed her response, so here it is in full.\n\nClose's full remarks are in the photo below: pic.twitter.com/lQ3kiMcBXf\n\n— Benjamin Royer (@thebenroyer) December 28, 2025\n\nClose's words quickly took over over online discourse and revealed two key things: coverage of women's sports still suffers in the face of other sports, namely college football, despite the meteoric rise in popularity for women's basketball, and the overall media landscape is suffering from a lack of resources for road coverage.\n\nWhen the Bruins stepped onto the court next for a dominant 97-61 over Penn State, Close and senior center Lauren Betts were met with a different sight after the game: a Zoom conference full of reporters from outlets like the Orange County Register, Los Angeles Times, and of course, The Sporting Tribune.\n\nClose made it clear in her opening statement that her frustrations earlier in the week stemmed from her desire to continue to promote women's sports and the game that she loves and the passion she has for her team.\n\nJessica Cryderman - The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA guard, Kiki Rice (1) dribbling during a NCAA basketball game against Cal Poly on December 16, 2025 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\"The reality of what my comments were after the Ohio State game were, I have two really passionate agendas in regards to this: I want to be a pioneer of growing the game period. I want to really be a part of the surge that's happening and and I want to be a part of telling these amazing stories that these players have, and they're incredible young women as well as amazing basketball players,\" Close said.\n\nShe continued, \"This is nothing to take away from any men's program at all. I love men's sports just as much as I love women's sports. But, if there was a top five team all year long, and they were playing another ranked team, I don't care what time of year it would be, I think there would be more coverage there. So I just want to fight for our players getting that same proportionate coverage and exposure that I believe they've earned.\"\n\nWomen's basketball has experienced more growth than ever in recent years with stars like Caitlin Clark and Paige Bueckers, now both WNBA superstars with the Indiana Fever and Dallas Wings respectively, shining a massive spotlight on the sport at both the college and professional levels.\n\nUCLA has been a part of that growth as well. An elite squad with several of their starters projected to be first-round picks in the upcoming WNBA Draft, the Bruins under Cori Close have brought a stellar brand of basketball to Westwood. Last season's Final Four-reaching squad brought in over 88,000 fans to Pauley Pavilion to watch a team that ranked no. 1 in the country for most of the season and were led by a superstar in Betts.\n\nJordan Teller - The Sporting Tribune\n\nCenter Lauren Betts #51 high fives guard Kiki Rice #1 of the UCLA Bruins during an NCAA basketball game against the Oregon Ducks, Sunday December 7, 2025 in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nBetts also spoke after the Penn State win on the issue of media coverage that the Bruins have contended.\n\n\"You have two really amazing teams, and I don't think that's something that should hopefully ever happen again [lack of coverage],\" Betts said. \"So, just continuing to grow the game in any way that we can, and to make sure that we speak out on situations like that. But, obviously I have a lot of respect for Coach Cori and what she had to say about it.\"\n\nClose has been a vocal advocate for the media and for coverage of her team and women's basketball as a whole, and the gratitude she has for reporters at her team's games is something she makes a point of stating in many postgame conferences.\n\nRobert Talamantes- The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA G Gabriela Jaquez (11) scores a fast break layup during an NCAA basketball game against the Michigan Wolverans, Wednesday January 1st, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThere are systemic issues facing the modern sports media landscape, issues acquiring access and resources among them, but just as there are issues there has also been a proliferation of outlets that serve a wide variety of niches in the athletic world. Close wants to serve both traditional and non-traditional outlets in terms of access and availability so that she can continue shining a light on the accomplishments her team has achieved and continue to elevate women's sports as a whole.\n\n\"I always want to be solution minded. I don't want to be just a complainer,\" Close said. \"I really want us to be a team that makes ourselves available, that gives good stories to tell... I think there needs to be access for non-traditional media outlets, as long as you're going for the right reasons, and you're really a part of wanting to tell the stories of these women. I think the days of limiting it to just traditional media outlets are over if we want to continue because.. there are so many squeezes on those traditional media outlets, I think we can't limit ourselves to what's worked in the past or how we've done things in the past.\"\n\nJohn Panganiban-The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA Bruins Coach Cori Close breaking down the game for Avary Cain (2) during an NCAA basketball game against Colgate, Sunday November 10th, 2024 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe impact of covering women's programs like UCLA goes well beyond entertainment factor. This new wave of women's sports popularity and the stories that athletes tell serves a humanitarian purpose as well. The inspiration that athletes can bring elevates the lives of the next generation that watches them.\n\nFollowing Betts' portion of Wednesday's conference. Close shared a story that illustrates that impact potential. Betts spoke with ESPN in an article published March 2025 about her mental health journey and after Wednesday's game, Close said that Betts met with one young girl waiting for an autograph that said Betts' article saved her own life. Betts came back to the locker room with happy tears in her eyes.\n\n\"That's just a real time example about why storytelling of these amazing women are so important.\"",

    "description": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. is a potential trade target of the Milwaukee Bucks, according to Sam Amick of The Athletic.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. is having the best season of his career during this campaign as the Nets' primary scoring option. Porter has been everything that Brooklyn could have asked for in terms of a shooter and scorer since acquiring him from the Denver Nuggets this past offseason and his name is heating up in trade rumors prior tot he deadline.\n\n\"It remains to be seen whether he can pull off anything significant, as Milwaukee is (by its own doing) limited in assets and options,\" The Athletic's Sam Amick wrote while discussing five teams around the league that could be making trades soon. In the instance, Amick cites the Milwaukee Bucks as one of the teams looking to upgrade their roster in some way, potentially by trading for Porter.\n\n\"The list of names under consideration is likely much longer than what is publicly known, but a few have emerged,\" Amick continued. \"The Kings’ LaVine is a confirmed target, as is — according to ESPN — Sacramento’s Malik Monk and Portland’s Jerami Grant. League sources say Brooklyn’s Michael Porter Jr. is a name worth watching as well.\"\n\nPorter, 27, could be on the verge of making the first All-Star appearance of his career as he's averaging 25.8 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 3.3 assists per game while shooting 49.6% from the field and 41.0% from three-point range. For a team like the Bucks, Porter could make sense given his ability to spread the floor with his shooting for someone like superstar forward Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nMilwaukee may not have a choice, but to go after someone like Porter if they are going to convince Antetokounmpo to stay in town and not pursue opportunities elsewhere. Antetokounmpo has been rumored over the past couple of seasons to be evaluating whether his place long-term should be with the Bucks. The Nets have experienced great success with Porter as the leader of the offense, but if the Bucks make them an offer for the Missouri Tiger that they can't refuse, Porter's time in Brooklyn could be short-lived.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: Report: Nets' Michael Porter Jr. could be a trade target of Bucks",

    "description": "A putrid defensive effort. A game featuring costly turnovers from Bryce Underwood. Here are takeaways from Michigan’s loss to Texas.",
    "fullText": "The Michigan Wolverines lost to Texas 41-27 in the Citrus Bowl, finishing the season 9-4.\n\nHere are key takeaways from Michigan’s loss to Texas.\n\nHeading into the fourth quarter, Michigan quarterback Bryce Underwood was 15-of-28 for 126 yards with two passing touchdowns. However, the wheels came off in the fourth quarter, and Underwood had two brutal interceptions thrown right to Texas defenders. Michigan was trailing just 24-20 heading into the final frame, but Underwood’s interceptions were extremely costly and careless. Underwood finished the day 23-of-42 for 199 yards with two touchdowns, three interceptions, along with 77 rushing yards and a score. Underwood’s just 18 and ups and downs during a true freshman campaign are to be expected. What’s troubling is how bad the interceptions were and how he played against the toughest teams on Michigan’s schedule.\n\nThe hope will be that Underwood has a better sophomore campaign with Kyle Whittingham as head coach, as Sherrone Moore didn’t exactly set him up for success this year. Even so, his interceptions in the Citrus Bowl were on him and must get cleaned up moving forward, otherwise Michigan will not be beating Ohio State or making a legitimate run at the College Football Playoff. Granted, Underwood’s ceiling is high, and he made many wow plays throughout 2025, but question marks still remain, and it’s not a sure thing that he develops into a superstar. At the very least, his showing in the Citrus Bowl was a discouraging effort heading into the offseason.\n\nMichigan defensive coordinator Wink Martindale almost certainly coached his last game at Michigan, and it couldn’t have gone much worse. Michigan had numerous missed tackles, they didn’t generate a sack despite blitzing a lot, they had blown coverages, and they allowed Arch Manning to gash them with his arm and legs. Manning was 21-of-34 for 221 yards with two touchdowns. Manning also embarrassed the Michigan defense as a runner with 155 yards, two touchdowns, including a 60-yard score to put Texas up 38-27. Michigan’s defense was bad against USC, Ohio State, and Texas, and a change in scheme and leadership is desperately needed on that side of the ball.\n\nWhile Michigan players didn’t execute at a high clip in the Citrus Bowl and the coaches didn’t call a good enough game to get a W, it’s Sherrone Moore’s fault that the game was so messy to begin with. Most criticism should be directed at Moore, not interim head coach Biff Poggi, the staff, or the players.\n\nThe 2025 season is now over and will be one that marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one with head coach Kyle Whittingham. With Whittingham in charge, there’s actually light at the end of the tunnel; there’s hope that this program can get back on track. Even before details of Moore’s scandal emerged, it was becoming increasingly clear that Moore and his staff weren’t of the caliber that competes for championships. With Whittingham, the hope of a College Football Playoff berth feels a lot more attainable.\n\nWhile Michigan’s loss to Texas was an ugly way to finish the year, the good news is the season is finally over, and the program can move forward in a more cohesive and successful direction.\n\nI do takeaways every week and have for the better part of the last decade on Maize n Brew. I’ve covered many wins, and some seasons that have been absolute duds (2017 stunk, 2020 hurt my soul, and the past two years have had painful moments as well), yet you, the Maize n Brew readers, are always here to interact with me and read these takeaways whether Michigan wins or loses. I say this on behalf of myself and the entire Maize n Brew staff — thank you, thank you, thank you! You are part of our lives, and you’re stuck with us a while longer, talking about this silly sport we love. Happy New Year! Talk to you in 2026.",

    "fullText": "CINCINNATI (AP) — Joe Burrow is in unfamiliar territory.\n\nFor the first time in his NFL career, the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback is preparing for a Week 18 start knowing that no matter what, the season ends on Sunday.\n\nBurrow was injured in 2020 and ‘23. The Bengals made it to the Super Bowl in 2021 and the AFC championship game in ’22 along with being in contention for a playoff spot up until the last game in 2024.\n\n“Obviously, you want to win a Super Bowl, you want to win MVPs, you want to be in the playoffs every year,” Burrow said. “My goals at this point are just going out and playing as good as I can and continuing to improve, finding ways to continue to be great and continue to find self improvement.”\n\nThe Bengals (6-10) close out the season on Sunday at home against the Cleveland Browns (4-12). While the Bengals defense has struggled this season, Burrow also missed more than half of the season because of a toe injury that required surgery.\n\nDuring the offseason, as Burrow works to get stronger, the front office will also need to strengthen the roster. Burrow said that he has a great line of communication with the front office and ownership.\n\n“I think my job is to No. 1, play as well as I can. No. 2, continue to improve, and No. 3, be the conduit between coaching staff, front office and the locker room,” Burrow said. “Relay feelings that players have, relay sentiments in the locker room because coaches and front office, they aren’t down there every day and they don’t understand a lot of the things that go on in the locker room. I think (as a) quarterback, your job is to relay some of those things.”\n\nFollowing three years where the Bengals have missed the postseason, Burrow said that there will need to be some changes for the Bengals to get back to contention in the AFC.\n\nBut unlike last season, when he stumped for re-signing players such as Tee Higgins and Mike Gesicki, Burrow is speaking \n\n“We want to be competing for championships every year,” Burrow said. “We don’t want to be in the spot we are in now, so something’s got to change, whether it’s players we have continuing to improve and get better and play championship-caliber football, or bringing in guys that will or whatever it may be.”\n\nRight now, Burrow’s main focus is preparing for a vaunted Browns’ defense and preparing for one of the top pass rushers in Myles Garrett. Burrow has been sacked 11 times by Garrett in nine meetings.\n\nGarrett is one sack away from setting the single-season record for sacks. While that presents a big challenge, the Bengals also have one of their best offensive lines in years. Because of the development of right tackle Amarius Mims and left guard Dylan Fairchild, the Browns will see a much-improved Bengals’ offensive line than what they faced in Week 1.\n\n“I think they’re playing exponentially better than they were at the time,” Burrow said. “I know they’re excited about the challenge, but I know (the Browns’) front is tough to deal with, starting with (Garrett). They have a lot of other guys, too, that can be very challenging to handle up front. I know they’re excited for it.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Any hope of the Seattle Seahawks putting safety and special teams standout D’Anthony Bell back on the practice squad was squashed by the team they just defeated last week.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers claimed Bell off of waivers on Wednesday, a day after Seattle waived Bell to make room for the return of Derick Hall. Bell has been with the Seahawks all season after signing as a free agent from the Cleveland Browns in the offseason. He’s been back-and-forth between the practice squad and active roster, recording a half-sack and a blocked punt along the way.\n\nBell is the fourth Seahawks player claimed off waivers this season. Cornerback Derion Kendrick returned to the Los Angeles Rams, safety Jerick Reed II went to the Tennessee Titans, and the Green Bay Packers claimed defensive tackle Quinton Bohanna, although Bohanna is a free agent again after he was let go by Green Bay.\n\nIt’s an interesting situation for Bell as the regular season comes to a close. Without a waiver claim, he could’ve been on the cusp of a first-round bye and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Instead, the Panthers need either a win on Saturday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or an Atlanta Falcons win over the New Orleans Saints to win the NFC South or extend their postseason drought to eight seasons.\n\nIf the Seahawks are in need of safety depth with Coby Bryant still injured, perhaps veteran Quandre Diggs is ready to return from his own injury while still on the practice squad.\n\nBest wishes to Bell in Charlotte, but it’s a bummer to see him go this late in the year.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — CAPITALS 6, RANGERS 3\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Tom Wilson had two goals and an assist to lead Washington past New York.\n\nWilson, who earlier in the day was named a member of Canada’s Olympic roster, got into a fight with Sam Carrick in the second period for at least his second Gordie Howe hat trick — a goal, an assist and a fight — since March 3, 2025.\n\nJustin Sourdif also had two goals and Anthony Beauvillier and Aliaksei Protas each scored for the Capitals, who have won two of the last three games.\n\nAdam Fox, making his return from long-term injured reserve, had a goal and an assist for the Rangers, who have lost three straight. Vincent Trocheck and Braden Schneider also scored.\n\nWith the Capitals tied 1-1 and needing a spark in the second, Wilson rose to the occasion. The 28-year-old came streaking up ice and leveled Noah Laba before getting to the front of the net and roofing a feed from Connor McMichael to restore Washington’s lead as he became the first Capital to hit the 20-goal mark this season. Minutes later, he answered for Laba’s hit, fighting Carrick.\n\nThe fight, initiated by Carrick, put the Capitals on the power play. Sourdif snuck a loose puck past Jonathan Quick, who had 21 saves, to end a 16-game goal drought to make it 3-1.\n\nFox responded with a power-play goal of his own soon after to pull things to 3-2 going into the third.\n\nProtas and Wilson, netting his 200th career goal, added insurance tallies late to cushion the lead.\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) — Steven Stamkos scored his 600th career goal and Nashville beat the Vegas.\n\nThe Predators, in the middle of a season-long seven-game road trip, won for the 12th time in 17 games, including the third of their first four on the trip.\n\nThe win put the Predators (18-17-4) above .500 for the first time since Oct. 16, just five games into the season, when they were 2-1-2.\n\nVegas, meanwhile, lost for the sixth time in seven games. The Knights closed their four-game homestand with a 1-2-1 mark.\n\nNow in his 18th season, Stamkos scored his 18th of the season and ninth against the Golden Knights since they entered the league in 2017. The game-tying goal was part of an unanswered three-goal spurt over five minutes that turned a 2-0 deficit into a 3-2 lead for the Predators.\n\nNick Perbix, Reid Schaefer and Michael Bunting also scored for the Predators. Justus Annunen made 29 saves.\n\nFormer Knight Erik Haula, who is two games shy of skating in his 800th game, registered the 200th assist of his career on Bunting’s goal.\n\nMark Stone, who earlier in the day was named to Canada’s Olympic roster, scored his 10th goal of the season, while Ben Hutton added his sixth for the Knights. Akira Schmid stopped 15 shots before being pulled late in the third period for an extra skater.\n\nVegas forward Mitch Marner and defenseman Shea Theodore were also named to Canada’s team. All three of the Knights represented their homeland in the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off.\n\nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Darren Raddysh scored midway through overtime, and Tampa Bay blew three one-goal leads before beating Anaheim for its fifth consecutive victory.\n\nTampa Bay coach Jon Cooper celebrated his 1,000th regular-season game in charge with his 595th victory as the longest-tenured bench boss in the NHL. The Lightning’s coach since March 2013 has also led them in 155 playoff games, won two championships and reached four Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nNikita Kucherov had a goal and an assist as the Lightning skated off with a win in the opener of their three-game California road trip when Raddysh converted a pass from Brandon Hagel, who had three assists.\n\nJ.J. Moser and Brayden Point also scored for Tampa Bay, and Andrei Vasilevskiy made 24 saves.\n\nMason McTavish tied it on a power play with 6:58 left in regulation for the Ducks, who have lost four straight and eight of 10. Jansen Harkins and Beckett Sennecke also scored, and Lukas Dostal stopped 24 shots as the Ducks earned a point for only the second time in six games.\n\nMoser opened the scoring in the first period with his first goal since agreeing to an eight-year, $54 million contract extension last weekend.\n\nAnaheim scored its first two goals off turnovers, with the 19-year-old Sennecke getting the 12th of his rookie season early in the third period.\n\nKucherov scored his 18th goal on a cross-ice pass from Hagel during a power play four minutes later, but the Ducks evened it again when Pavel Mintyukov made an exceptional play at the blue line to set up McTavish for his 10th goal.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Macklin Celebrini had a goal and an assist hours after being selected to play for Team Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics, and San Jose beat Minnesota in a shootout.\n\nCelebrini and William Eklund scored for the Sharks in the tiebreaker, while Minnesota failed to convert on either of its two attempts. San Jose has won three straight following a three-game slide.\n\nIgor Chernyshov had a goal and two assists, and Jeff Skinner also scored for the Sharks. The 19-year-old Celebrini got his 40th assist of the season, passing Mikko Rantanen for second-most in the NHL. Yaroslav Askarov finished with 20 saves.",

Danielson said before pointing to his producer and adding, \"This guy right here.\"\n\nAbruptly, CBS went to commercial break, wrapping the broadcast. Hard outs are part of live TV, and Danielson of course knows that, but that ad interruption brought an untimely end to an otherwise beautiful tribute to one of the greatest voices in college football history.\n\nMinutes earlier, Danielson — flanked by play-by-play announcer Brad Nessler and sideline reporter Jenny Dell — heard about and watched back some of the great moments during his illustrious career in the booth.\n\n\"To have done it with somebody that is unmatched in what you do has been a privilege,\" Nessler said. \"It's been an honor.

Gui Santos added 13 points off the bench, hitting three 3s for Golden State, which went 24 of 49 from beyond the arc.\n\nBrandon Miller led Charlotte with 33 points, while LaMelo Ball finished with 27, going 7 of 10 from 3-point range. Rookie Kon Knueppel added 20 points in his return from a one-game absence because of a sprained ankle.\n\nCharlotte played without starters Miles Bridges and Ryan Kalkbrenner because of injuries.\n\nThe Warriors led 69-64 lead at halftime behind four 3s and 15 points from Curry — who grew up in Charlotte and played college ball at nearby Davidson — and appeared on the verge of blowing out the Hornets after starting the third quarter on a 10-0 run. But Charlotte quickly turned the tables with Ball hitting three 3s, helping the Hornets put together a 32-12 run to take the lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe momentum swung back to the Warriors after Podziemski knocked down two 3s to open the fourth.\n\nThe Warriors held the lead throughout the rest of the fourth quarter and Draymond Green’s tip-in off a Curry miss from deep with 1 minute remaining pushed the lead to six. Butler hit two free throws with 17 seconds left to seal the win.\n\nPodziemski finished 5 of 7 from 3-point range, including a leaning 3-pointer off one foot to beat the shot clock.\n\nThe Hornets lost despite outscoring the Warriors 56-32 in the paint.\n\nATLANTA (AP) — Jalen Johnson scored 34 points and Atlanta overcame Anthony Edwards’ 30 points for Minnesota to beat the Timberwolves and end a seven-game losing streak.\n\nAtlanta took control by outscoring Minnesota 37-23 in the second quarter to lead 70-49 at halftime.\n\nJohnson added 10 rebounds and six assists.

Daniels also had two steals and two blocks.\n\nThe Hawks claimed their first win since beating Philadelphia 120-117 on Dec. 14 and improved to 6-11 at home.\n\nThe Hawks were bolstered by the return of Kristaps Porzingis, who scored 16 points in 17 minutes off the bench after missing 10 games with an illness.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Paolo Banchero had 29 points and 10 rebounds and hit the go-ahead basket with 7.5 seconds remaining as Orlando rallied from a 10-point, third-quarter deficit and beat Indiana, sending the Pacers to their 10th consecutive loss.\n\nAs the clock was winding down in regulation, Banchero backed down Aaron Nesmith and banked home an 11-foot shot for the final basket in a game that included 12 ties and 11 lead changes. The power forward finished 12 of 21 from the field and 5 for 7 at the line.\n\nNesmith missed a potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 3.1 seconds remaining.\n\nOrlando’s Desmond Bane scored 18, Anthony Black added 15 and former Pacers center Goga Bitadze 14.\n\nThe Magic (19-15), who have been without leading scorer Franz Wagner (22.7 points per game) since Dec. 7 due to a high-ankle sprain, welcomed back point guard Jalen Suggs from a seven-game absence with a hip issue. Suggs had 11 points and three assists.\n\nThe Pacers have the NBA’s worst record at 6-28. The 10-game losing streak matches the fifth-longest in franchise history.\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell scored 34 points, Darius Garland added 19 and Cleveland pulled away in the fourth quarter to defeat Phoenix to snap its four-game winning streak.\n\nIt was Mitchell’s 18th 30-point game this season, third-most in the league, after he had only 10 points in Monday night’s win at San Antonio. The All-Star guard — fourth in the league in scoring at 29.7 points per game — was 10 of 18 from the field, including four 3-pointers, and also had 10 rebounds and seven assists in 30 minutes.\n\nJaylon Tyson had 18 points and Sam Merrill added 16. Evan Mobley (16 points, 10 rebounds) and Jarrett Allen (16 points, 11 rebounds) both had double-doubles.\n\nCleveland has won two straight and improved to 19-16 after going 7-7 in December.\n\nDevin Booker led Phoenix with 32 points, including 20 in the third quarter as the Suns rallied from a 67-54 halftime deficit to get within two late in the quarter.

    "fullText": "UConn women’s basketball closed out 2025 with a sloppy 90-53 victory over the Providence Friars at Amica Mutual Pavilion on New Year’s Eve.\n\nThe Huskies were without starting point guard KK Arnold, who suffered a nasal fracture in practice on Tuesday and didn’t play. Without the floor general, they committed a season-high 21 turnovers and struggled to get the offense into rhythm at times.\n\nAllie Ziebell made her first career start in place of Arnold and finished with nine points. Azzi Fudd led the team with 18 points and six assists while Sarah Strong totaled 17 points and seven rebounds, though she had five turnovers as well. Blanca Quiñonez put up 11 points — her fifth straight game in double-figures — and added four assists and four rebounds as well while Jana El Alfy reached double-figures for the second time this season with 10 points.\n\nUConn led by 23 after the first quarter but only extended its lead by 14 over the final 30 minutes.\n\nStrong got the Huskies going early with back-to-back 3-pointers to open the contest and four triples in the opening quarter. UConn fell behind 9-7 before ripping off a 21-0 run to close the period. Providence opened the second with five straight points, then the Huskies responded with 11 consecutive points. The Friars ended the drought with a 3-pointer before UConn held them without a basket for the final 4:49 of the half. The Huskies took a 29-point lead into the locker room.\n\nThe runs continued in the third quarter. Providence scored the first four points, only for UConn to put up 16 of the next 19. The Huskies cruised the rest of the way en route to a 37-point victory.\n\nAyanna Patterson also missed the contest with a concussion that she suffered in practice on Tuesday. Caroline Ducharme (shoulder), Ice Brady (knee inflammation) and Morgan Cheli (foot/ankle) remained out as well.\n\nWith the win, UConn improves to 14-0 on the season and 5-0 in Big East play. Next, the Huskies will return home for their first game of 2026 against Seton Hall. Tip-off is set for noon on Saturday at PeoplesBank Arena in Hartford.",

    "fullText": "As the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks prepare for the game of the year, the College Football Playoff is hitting its stride. The quarterfinals are underway, and we have a massive one tonight between Ohio State and Miami.\n\nThe Buckeyes are the defending champs, while the Hurricanes are trying to bring back the 80’s as we head into the new year. There are some massive prospects, literally and figuratively, that the Seahawks will likely be watching tonight, from a scouting perspective.\n\nDon’t be surprised if a few Seattle scouts are in Dallas tonight for this massive game at the Cotton Bowl.\n\nFrancis Mauigoa, OL, Miami – the former five-star recruit was one of the first major additions to what Mario Cristobal’s run in rebuilding the Hurricanes program.\n\nThe 6-6, 315 lbs left tackle has been a steady staple for a Miami team that is about to take on its most toughest test of the season. Against Notre Dame and Texas A&M this season, Mauigoa was good, not great.\n\nI think he’s got a chance to go in the top ten, but I also think he’s better suited as a guard, and so there is potential for a slide. He’s a guy that maybe worth trading up for.\n\nAkheem Mesidor, Edge, Miami – While Reuben Bain Jr. gets all the hype, his edge rushing partner has shown to be just as dominant in 2025.\n\nMesidor, a six year college veteran, is having his best year yet for the Hurricanes. On the year, Mesidor has 51 total tackles with 13.5 tackles for a loss, including 8.5 sacks. His age is a factor, he’ll be 25 when he plays his first NFL game, so he’s probably a one contract type of player, but he’s an interesting day three option.\n\nSonny Styles, LB, Ohio State – Probably one of the safest picks at the linebacker position in this upcoming draft. Arvell Reese gets all the hype, and rightfully so, but Styles is as solid and safe of a pick, while being a stud championship caliber player.\n\nOn this Seahawks defense, it’s hard not to look at the linebacker spot as an area where John Schneider and Mike Macdonald want to improve. Ernest Jones is a good player, but he could use some help and depth at the position, especially someone as athletic as Styles.\n\nStyles may not feel like the most splashy first round draft pick, but he could be an immediate positive addition to this already great defense.\n\nKayden McDonald, DT, Ohio State – People will push against Seattle going defensive tackle so early in the draft, but I think it’s fair to wonder if going dline makes the most sense. Leonard Williams, Tank Lawrence, and Uchenna Nwosu have all been fantastic. They are also all on the backside of their careers, and it’s fair to wonder if this season is the peak of their powers.\n\nMcDonald may be the best defensive tackle in this class and another guy that is worth trading up for. The All-American has 57 combined tackles this year, eight tackles for a loss and 3 sacks from the nose tackle position. You simply do not run on him.\n\nMcDonald can be the perfect succession plan for the Seahawks with Leonard Williams. McDonald allows Williams to cut back on his snaps, staying healthy and explosive through the end of his contract. Leonard Williams is the perfect mentor for McDonald and could allow this team to essentially add a second Bryon Murphy.",

    "description": "An API that won't work if you're in Portugal.",
    "fullText": "Many programmers are accustomed to the idea that\ndealing with time is hard. Despite that it's still quite\neasy for things to go awry, even when you think you're doing the right thing.\nThis is the story of a bug report from Portugal that ended up being the most\nmysterious problem I've solved at work so far.\n\nAt $DAYJOB I was working on a team which maintains a particular command line\ntool. One day a user reported to us something like this:\n\nYour tool works for me, but only if I delete this file after every use.\n\nSounds odd. Who would design such an application? Surely not us.\nInquiring further we got some reproduction steps that amounted to\n\nWell, shucks, not only is that weird, but I can't reproduce the issue on my\nmachine when I use the tool. Neither can any of my co-workers. Maybe we goofed\nand we're somehow corrupting that cache file? Let's get some verbose logs from\nthe user and see if that tells us anything.\n\nThe logs came back with an incredibly cryptic sounding message.\n\nIt might not seem like much to go off of at first, but it was enough to point\nme in the right direction. The error message wasn't coming from our tool, but\nfrom an external service we interacted with.\n\nUltimately I determined that when the user deleted their cache file it altered\nthe program behavior to avoid an API call. When the cache file did exist\nwe were making an extra API call to validate the cache contents. The\nInternal Error came from that service. But why?\n\nLuckily, the verbosity of the logs included a correlation ID. When we opened\na support inquiry with the owners of the API we were able to get very specific\nanswers about why this was failing.\n\nThe error, it turned out, was a 500 Internal Server Error coming from an\nundocumented, internal-only API. Furthermore, the internal API was not being\nused correctly. There was a stack trace with an error that said\n\nThe value of said invalid string was\n\nThe API support engineers were reasonably confused and suggested we should\nstart by not calling the internal-only API with invalid data.\n\nA little more curiosity and some sleuthing seemed to paint our tool as the\nprimary suspect. What was up with that string value anyway? We hadn't corrupted\nthe cache earlier, but maybe we were doing something weird with datetimes?\nWell, when translated for percent encoding it ends up being\n\nThe á indicated some non-English-speaking language, but which one? Turns out,\nthe user of our original bug report was located in Portugal!\n\nOn seeing this new info about the \"invalid string\" the user decided to set\ntheir system's locale to an English-speaking one. The problem went away!\nClearly our tool was messing up and calling the internal API with a datetime\ngenerated on the user's system. How else could a Portuguese datetime reach the\nserver?\n\nIt seemed so obvious that we were at fault, but I couldn't figure out how! I\nscoured our code, but found no reference to the internal API. Moreover, none of\nthe public APIs that we were calling received datetimes as input. We weren't\neven collecting any user-controlled strings to submit to the API.\n\nAt this point I was nearly stumped, but on a whim I said to myself what if it\nisn't our tool? What if it is the server after all? How could that\npossibly work?\n\nApparently keeping the MDN HTTP Headers reference under your pillow has some\nbenefits because I remembered that the Accept-Language\nheader exists.\n\nI looked through the source code of the API client library that our tool used\nand what did I find?\n\nUnder the hood the API client library was submitting the user's language and\nlocale choice to the server. This opened up the possibility that our tool\nwasn't responsible for generating the datetime!\n\nTo lend further credence to this idea I took our tool out of the mix and used\ncurl to submit the API requests directly.\n\nThe API request worked just fine on my machine with en-US as the\nlanguage tag. Other English-speaking tags like en-CA for Canada or en-GB\nfor Great Britain worked, but pt-PT for Portugal failed! Testing for other\nnon-English tags like fr-FR, de-DE, ja-JP, and zh-CN revealed that with\nno difference in API payload the API failed unless Accept-Language was set to\nan English-speaking locale.\n\nI had demonstrated that this was indeed a server-side issue. All that remained\nwas for me to uncover how it happened!\n\nLuckily, I had access to both the client and server code for this API. I knew\nthe routes that were involved from the client code, so I could explore freely\nwith some idea of what I was looking for. I traced the path through the\nserver code from the initial ASP.NET controller entrypoint to the application\nlogic.\n\nAlong the way I discovered that it was actually the public API code that\ncalled the internal API (which makes sense). The internal API required a\ntimestamp as one of its arguments. Specifically, it required a timestamp\nformatted according to RFC 1123 and the public API devs were only too happy\nto oblige.\n\nIn essence, what the public API did before calling the internal API was this.\n\nLater, within the internal API code that timestamp was parsed from a string\nback into a DateTime like this.\n\nOur problem was somewhere between these two calls. One to generate the\ntimestamp, the other to parse it. But how? Neither API's code made any attempt\nto localize the timestamp. Neither API even handled the Accept-Language\nheader that put me on this train of thought to begin with.\n\nC# and .NET are still somewhat foreign to me, so I had to do some homework. As\nit turns out, much has been written on the topic of parsing DateTimes in\n.NET. Jeff Moser's Does Your Code Pass the Turkey Test?\ndives deep into the many thorny issues of internationalization and\nScott Hanselman's piece on the\nsubtlety of DateTime.ParseExact has this to say\n\n... InvariantCulture is almost always necessary when you’re working in a\nnon-UI context.\n\nInvariantCulture is .NET's way of handling\n\n... culture-sensitive string operations that are not affected by the\nconventions of the current culture and that are consistent across cultures.\n\nThis accurately describes how we want this timestamp parsing to work. The\nparsing is potentially culture-sensitive, but we're working with a fixed\nformat where days can only be expressed as Mon, Tue, etc. and months can\nonly be expressed as Jan, Feb, etc. RFC 1123 inherits strong\nAnglocentrism from RFC 822. People were less concerned with\ni18n in 1982 and 1989.\n\nThe internal API code was using InvariantCulture to parse the timestamp, but\nthe public API was not using it to generate the timestamp. Unfortunately, this\nleft the door wide open for bugs. If you generate a DateTime in a specific\nculture and then try to parse it with InvariantCulture you're going to have a\nbad time.\n\nIn our case though the developer hadn't written anything so obviously wrong.\nRather, they'd written\n\nwhich seems innocuous at first glance. Sadly, passing an explicit culture to\nToString is not the only way for a specific culture to end up in your string.\n\nUnbeknownst to the public API developer there was a dragon lurking at the top\nof the call stack.\n\nIn a head-tilting design decision, someone had used\nThread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture to set the culture for\nthe entire thread based on the Accept-Language header in one of the\ncontroller base classes. This invisible decision was something like a\nhalf-dozen layers of inheritance removed from visibility for the public API\ndevs, let alone the internal API.\n\nWith that hidden footgun it's no longer safe to call\nDateTime.UtcNow.ToString! You could be generating a timestamp in any culture.\nScott Hanselman's \"almost always necessary\" comment feels particularly astute\nin light of this.\n\nI would have liked to tease apart the design decision to set culture at a\nthread level, but who knows what other house of cards behaviors that might have\nuncovered. The simplest, most surgical fix for this issue was to just generate\nthe required timestamp using InvariantCulture.\n\nI submitted a patch and the API team was happy to merge it. With that fix in\nplace the public API ignored the thread-specific culture and always generated\ntimestamps for the internal API with an English language format. Callers of the\npublic API from Portugal, France, Germany, Japan, or China were now able to use\nit without the mysterious TF400898: An Internal Error Occurred.\n\nIf you've followed the \"Crimes with DateTimes\" tale this far then, like me,\nyou might have a lot of lingering questions. I'll do my best to answer the\nones I can and leave the rest as a thought exercise for the reader.\n\nYou might have noticed that I omitted motive from the title above. We found the\nmeans and the opportunity, but why did the devs of the internal API choose to\nrequire an RFC 1123 timestamp?\n\nThankfully, they left a clue about their motivation in a comment next to their\nDateTime.ParseExact call. Paraphrasing a bit, it essentially said:\n\nWe have to use the \"R\" formatter because JavaScript's\nDate.toUTCString gives dates like Mon, 17 Apr 2006 21:22:48 GMT.\n\nSo, the devs were somehow bound to JavaScript's idea of what a datetime should\nbe. In 2025 it's easy to be critical of such a decision, but that example date\nin 2006 date should be our cue to have a little sympathy.\n\nJavaScript's Date is notoriously bad.\nDate.toUTCString follows RFC 7231 which has RFC 1123 as a\ndistant relative. It's inspired by a Java class that was\nalready deprecated in 1997. Also, Date.toISOString wasn't\nintroduced until ECMAScript 5 in 2009. If this code was written in 2006,\nTemporal wouldn't be a twinkle in someone's eye for\nanother decade, let alone a TC39 proposal. Devs facing any pressure from a\nfront-end team to make their API accessible to JavaScript in 2006 didn't have\nstellar options. At least they used the common glue of RFC 1123 which was still\na relevant standard.\n\nI have to speculate on this one, but the public API in question is many years\nold and heavily tied to a front-end UI. While largely RESTful, the API and UI\nhave grown in concert with each other (as evidenced by aforementioned JS\ninfluence). Understanding some of the resulting design decisions is as much\narchaeology as engineering.\n\nTimestamps aren't the only thing governed by culture. Certain translation of\nstrings the user might see in the UI could be affected too, such as whether to\nuse . or , as a numerical separator. Having thread-specific culture opens\nthe door for some bugs it likely closes the door on others and was probably\nconvenient to manage centrally.\n\nIf you started from scratch I'm sure there's a way that's more explicit, but\nthe number of hours involved and the the number of other things that might\nbreak as a result is likely too high to justify the effort. As usual, it's\ntradeoffs all the way down.\n\nNow we enter the realm of questions for which I don't have answers. It seems\ntrite at this point, but isn't mutable global (or thread-local) state known to\nbe the root of all evil?\n\nI have my quibbles with these design choices, but .NET has a storied history of\nbeing a successful choice for a lot of people. Especially if your goal is\ndeveloper productivity for multi-threaded, graphical application programming.\n\nI suspect the intention was to create a pragmatic set of defaults which\nencourage the right behavior. The goal, as Jeff Atwood has talked about,\nshould be \"fall[ing] into the The Pit of Success\" (a phrase coined by a\nlanguage designer at Microsoft). In this case, it's far too easy to fall into\n\"pit of despair\" by choosing the simplest option.\n\nMy personal assessment is that the framework designers only partially\nsucceeded. DateTime.ToString is hiding complexity from the programmer that\nlulls them into a false sense of safety. The docs for that method have a lot of\nculture-specific remarks that are almost too much information with too few\nwarnings about the pitfalls.\n\nIt's easy to criticize, but I should offer some constructive commentary as\nwell. Knowing pitfalls exist in the framework, what could the devs have done\ndifferently? If you mention DateTime in a search you'll find plenty of\nresults suggesting you use DateTimeOffset instead, but that\nactually has the same problem.\n\nThe lowest hanging fruit is linting. In his blog post from 2008 Jeff Moser\nmentions two rules:\n\nThose rules will catch you making the dangerous mistake of relying on the\ndefaults and suggest you use the overloaded counterparts instead.\n\nThe more difficult option is to resist the temptation to let JavaScript dictate\nwhich format you use to represent time. RFC 3339 had been around for 4 years\nin 2006 and ISO 8601 existed as early as 1988! Those standards offer\na host of datetime formatting options which should have\nlet them sidestep culture-specific issues. 2025-12-31T22:11:57Z is harder for\na human to read than Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:11:57 GMT, but a machine will parse\nit just fine and there's less room for error.\n\nIf you're reading this after 2025, first, thanks for reading this far! Second,\nmaybe go learn about timezone-aware datetimes. Check out RFC 9557, read about\nthe approach Temporal is taking to solve the problems of\nJavaScript's Date, and maybe peek at the\n.NET docs on dates, times, and time zones.\n\nMay all your bugs be trivial and your machine-readable datetimes",

    "description": "Adam Mosseri offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending Instagram.",
    "fullText": "It's no secret that AI-generated content took over our social media feeds in 2025. Now, Instagram's top exec Adam Mosseri has made it clear that he expects AI content to overtake non-AI imagery and the significant implications that shift has for its creators and photographers.\n\nMosseri shared the thoughts in a lengthy post about the broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. And he offered a notably candid assessment on how AI is upending the platform. \"Everything that made creators matter—the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked—is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,\" he wrote. \"The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.\"\n\nBut Mosseri doesn't seem particularly concerned by this shift. He says that there is \"a lot of amazing AI content\" and that the platform may need to rethink its approach to labeling such imagery by \"fingerprinting real media, not just chasing fake.\"\n\nSocial media platforms are going to come under increasing pressure to identify and label AI-generated content as such. All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality. There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media. Camera manufacturers could cryptographically sign images at capture, creating a chain of custody.\n\nOn some level, it's easy to understand how this seems like a more practical approach for Meta. As we've previously reported, technologies that are meant to identify AI content, like watermarks, have proved unreliable at best. They are easy to remove and even easier to ignore altogether. Meta's own labels are far from clear and the company, which has spent tens of billions of dollars on AI this year alone, has admitted it can't reliably detect AI-generated or manipulated content on its platform.\n\nThat Mosseri is so readily admitting defeat on this issue, though, is telling. AI slop has won. And when it comes to helping Instagram's 3 billion users understand what is real, that should largely be someone else's problem, not Meta's. Camera makers — presumably phone makers and actual camera manufacturers — should come up with their own system that sure sounds a lot like watermarking to \"to verify authenticity at capture.\" Mosseri offers few details about how this would work or be implemented at the scale required to make it feasible.\n\nMosseri also doesn't really address the fact that this is likely to alienate the many photographers and other Instagram creators who have already grown frustrated with the app. The exec regularly fields complaints from the group who want to know why Instagram's algorithm doesn't consistently surface their posts to their on followers.\n\nBut Mosseri suggests those complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of \"polished\" square images, he says, \"is dead.\" Camera companies, in his estimation, are \"are betting on the wrong aesthetic\" by trying to \"make everyone look like a professional photographer from the past.\" Instead, he says that more \"raw\" and \"unflattering\" images will be how creators can prove they are real, and not AI. In a world where Instagram has more AI content than not, creators should prioritize images and videos that intentionally make them look bad.",

    "fullText": "For the second time in less than 18 months, Calgary’s most important water transmission line has burst dramatically.\n\nThe repeat rupture of the Bearspaw south feeder main below the Trans-Canada Highway Tuesday night has resulted in a boil water advisory for three northwest communities, road closures along 16th Avenue and Sarcee Trail N.W., Stage 4 outdoor water restrictions citywide, and pleas from municipal officials to curtail indoor water use.\n\nHere’s what to know about the situation:\n\nThe boil-water advisories, which are issued by Alberta Health Services, apply to roughly 2,000 homes and 100 businesses in Montgomery, Point McKay and Parkdale — the three communities immediately downstream of Tuesday’s water main break.\n\n“All residents and businesses within this area are advised to bring all tap water to a rolling boil for one full minute prior to any consumption,” the city stated.\n\n“Currently we do not have an estimate for how long the boil water advisory will be necessary. This issue is temporary, and our crews are working 24/7 to complete the necessary repair work.”\n\nWater used for bathing or for laundering of clothing does not need to be boiled.\n\nWater wagons will be stationed throughout the three impacted communities for residents to access treated water.\n\nResidents may instead choose to purchase bottled water for consumption for the duration of the advisory, the city stated.\n\nStage 4 restrictions refer to outdoor water use. In the wintertime, the restrictions will mostly impact the flooding of outdoor skating rinks or other large outdoor water usages, such as industrial snow-making.\n\nBut under the current restrictions, indoor facilities such as pools, rinks and recreation facilities are being advised to implement their own water reduction plans, according to the city.\n\n“As part of our efforts to manage water supply during this critical period, we need everyone to take simple but impactful steps to reduce indoor water use,” the city stated in a news release.\n\nFor households to reduce their own water use, the city suggests limiting showers to three minutes, flushing toilets only when necessary and running dishwashers and laundry only with full loads.\n\n“They sound like small things (but) they make a huge difference for us during this time,” said the city’s water services director, Nancy Mackay.\n\nThe Bearspaw South feeder main is Calgary’s most important water transmission line. It transports 60 per cent of treated water from the Bearspaw water treatment plant to underground reservoirs throughout the city.\n\nMost of the feeder main is composed of prestressed concrete cylinder pipe. It was built in 1975 and is nearly 12 kilometres long.\n\nA “catastrophic failure” of the feeder main’s integrity led to the pipe bursting dramatically on June 5, 2024, near Shouldice Athletic Park in Montgomery. The incident led to a days-long boil-water advisory in Bowness, weeks of road construction and detours, and two bouts of citywide Stage 4 watering restrictions, which officials said were necessary to keep Calgary’s water supply from depleting.\n\nShortly after the initial rupture in 2024, city officials announced that further inspection had discovered five additional “hot spots” along the pipe were prone to a similar catastrophic failure if not immediately repaired. The city declared a state of local emergency on June 15.\n\nUltimately, crews ended up replacing or repairing 29 at-risk sections of the pipe, prolonging water restrictions in Calgary for most of that summer. The crisis cost more than $35 million.\n\nThe city’s own investigation, which included consultants from Associated Engineering Ltd., determined there were multiple causes for the June 2024 break.\n\nThe investigation’s findings, published in a 600-page report, outlined a series of factors that led to the pipe’s failure.\n\nChief among those was microcracking of the outer mortar layer of the pipe, which allowed soil to contact and corrode the inner pipe’s reinforcement wires, causing hundreds of them to snap en masse.\n\n“The cause of the June 5 failure was identified as the breakage of a sufficient number of prestress wires in a pipe segment, causing a loss of pressure-resisting capability of that pipe,” Steve Wyton, the city’s manager of asset management planning, told a city council committee.\n\nThe compromised mortar allowed stress corrosion cracking and a phenomenon called hydrogen embrittlement of the wires, resulting in brittle wire failures or fractures.\n\nSoil testing conducted along the feeder main as part of the investigation determined significantly high chloride levels near the point of the pipe’s original failure. Samples gathered at five additional repair sites demonstrated a strong correlation between the pipeline’s integrity and high chloride concentrations.\n\nWhile not a definitive cause, one official suggested the city’s practice of road de-icing (which uses sodium chloride, or salt) may have contributed to the high chloride levels. However, they stressed the high chemical concentrations were not uniform, and that more investigation would be needed to determine the considerable change in soil quality over the past 10 years.\n\nAlthough the city’s own report was published, an independent investigation is also underway, led by retired ATCO executive Siegfried Kiefer.\n\nThe findings of his panel’s investigation are expected to be presented to city council in January, a city spokesperson recently told Postmedia.\n\nIn short, that remains to be determined.\n\nAt Wednesday’s news conference, officials said further assessment is needed to determine why the pipe burst a second time, but noted that acoustic monitoring technology inside the pipe failed to pick up any signs that another catastrophic failure was imminent.\n\nHowever, in February of this year, a city official did warn the previous city council that, while the feeder main had been stabilized, several sections were showing signs of deterioration.\n\nSome of those segments would need to be either replaced or repaired as the pipe continues to lose its structural integrity, they said, adding that roughly five kilometres of feeder main is composed of prestressed concrete cylinder pipe, which is the material prone to deterioration.\n\nCity officials will provide another public update on Thursday, with more technical information regarding the rupture.\n\nLong-term, the city is carrying out a series of projects to improve Calgary’s water system redundancy and reduce reliance on the Bearspaw south feeder main, which Mayor Jeromy Farkas called “a ticking time bomb.”\n\nThe projects include the construction of two new feeder mains (one in the north, one in the south), upgrades to the Glenmore water treatment plant and construction of a new water treatment facility right next to the Bearspaw plant.\n\nThe city is also planning to replace the Bearspaw south feeder main with a new water transmission line parallel to it.\n\nThe project, called the Bearspaw South Feeder Main Improvements Project, will be built in two stages, eventually adding a six-kilometre-long pipe parallel to a similar-sized strip of the existing feeder main.\n\nThe city has begun inviting vendors to submit bids for the construction of the first stage of the line. Construction is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2026, after selection of the most competitive bid. The request for proposal, the first step in the procurement process following the pipe’s design, was issued earlier this month.",

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg famously dropped out of college to focus on Facebook. The cofounder of Manus says he took the same path — and now they have merged.",
    "fullText": "Meta was cofounded by a college dropout — and so was its latest acquisition.\n\nJi Yichao, the cofounder and chief scientist of Manus, the AI startup snapped up by Meta, shared two pictures on X: one of his younger self behind a laptop, and another of a young Mark Zuckerberg, seemingly in the same room, also working at a laptop.\n\nBoth pictures appear to have been taken at the so-called \"Facebook House\" in Palo Alto, California, a five-bed home where Zuckerberg worked on Facebook after famously dropping out of Harvard University in 2004. The house was later rented by budding entrepreneurs and business students.\n\n\"21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,\" Ji wrote in the Monday X post.\n\nThe 32-year-old Ji was the public face of Manus for its launch in March, introducing its \"general-purpose\" AI agent designed to carry out tasks autonomously. Meta announced its acquisition of Manus on Monday, which the Wall Street Journal reported exceeded $2 billion.\n\nAccording to reports in Chinese media, Ji started a computer science degree at the Beijing Information Science and Technology University (BISTU) in 2010, but later dropped out to focus on entrepreneurship. He returned to BISTU in 2015 and graduated in 2018, according to a blog from the university. Manus did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nZuckerberg and Ji have plenty of company. Meta's other big AI acquisition this year, Scale AI, was founded by another college dropout — Alexandr Wang. Microsoft cofounders Bill Gates and Paul Allen dropped out of college, along with Apple CEO Steve Jobs, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more.\n\n21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge. https://t.co/NpnNkqhuso pic.twitter.com/s6v7kDsq1y\n\nJi's post comes as college degrees are under renewed scrutiny. Gen Z in particular has been questioning whether a degree is worth the debt, while others are wondering if college can future-proof their career prospects in a job market being shaken up by AI.\n\nFei-Fei Li, a Stanford professor known as the \"Godmother of AI,\" said earlier this month that a college degree matters less now when her company hires software engineers.\n\nHowever, data published by the New York Federal Reserve in April suggested that a college degree can still pay off in the long run — provided students pick the right degree.\n\nManus was launched in March by the Chinese AI product studio Butterfly Effect. The startup relocated to Singapore in mid-2025 and said it has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue. Meta said it would continue to offer Manus' subscription as a separate business while integrating the startup's technology into its own platforms.",

    "title": "How Google, Microsoft, Walmart, and other corporate giants are preparing for an aging workforce",
    "description": "Business Insider reached out to more than 75 major employers, including Walmart and Google, about their efforts to support aging workers.",
    "fullText": "Corporate America is facing a silver tsunami — and some companies are better prepared than others.\n\nWalmart is redesigning jobs to keep older workers on the payroll. Microsoft is offering what it calls \"wraparound care\" to support healthy aging. Google is coaching its employees to prepare for retirement. Some smaller companies have introduced chief longevity officers to help workers navigate health, wellness, and the transition into retirement.\n\nThese are some of the initiatives companies shared with Business Insider, after we contacted more than 75 major employers about their efforts to support aging workers.\n\nFifteen responded and shared policies that address healthcare and well-being, career longevity, flexible work arrangements, and retention. Many of the companies contacted employ thousands of people working past retirement age. Most didn't respond or declined to comment.\n\nAt Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, about 13.3% of the workforce — or over 200,000 employees — is over 60 years old, and more than 300,000 employees have a tenure of more than 10 years.\n\n\"We want to be a great place to work during every stage of life,\" a spokesperson said. \"People come here for a first job or a second career, and we have associates from 16 to 100.\"\n\nThomas Magnuson, 83, has worked as a yard driver at a Walmart facility in Wisconsin since 1999. A few years ago, he transitioned to an asset protection position, where he monitors fire systems and recertifies employees who use certain equipment. Magnuson said he doesn't have enough savings to retire. He described the work, which pays low six figures, as fulfilling.\n\nRuth Finkelstein, a professor of public health at Hunter College, said employers should provide mentorship and flexibility to workers of all ages.\n\n\"People reach their peak earnings in their 50s and then gradually decrease after that until they abruptly decrease after retirement,\" Finkelstein said. \"We should have retirement security adequate to meet people's needs without them having to work for their whole lives, and we should have legislation that's much stronger than that against employment discrimination.\"\n\nSome of the biggest names in the retail, entertainment, and food sectors have proposed age-friendly policies and initiatives to support older workers.\n\nCVS Health has developed programs to attract mature workers and develop their skills. Many of Disney's employees are in their second or third career, said Tami Garcia, executive vice president of people and culture at Disney Experiences. The company gives out the Walt Disney Legacy Award and holds service anniversary ceremonies.\n\n\"For many, having a role at one of our Disney parks is a second or even third career, and we deeply value the experience, wisdom, and mentorship that can bring,\" Garcia said. \"From celebrating milestone anniversaries — including 50+ years of service — to honoring those who embody Walt Disney's legacy through our recognition programs, we showcase respect, care, and appreciation for our Cast Members.\"\n\nSome companies have prioritized certain accommodations, such as flexible work schedules. A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider that the company's \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy has invested over $500 million in operational improvements and the workplace experience, which could benefit older workers looking for more flexibility. The spokesperson said that 85% of employees receive their preferred shifts.\n\nEllen Ernst Kossek, a professor at Purdue University who studies work-life relationships, said companies should consider reducing the workloads of older employees, helping these workers adapt to new technologies, and finding ways to challenge age-related stereotypes.\n\n\"There's a stereotype that older workers are not as current, but just as you would train new workers or encourage people to get a certificate, they could adapt their strategies to look for people with AI skills and encourage people to keep their skills up,\" Kossek said.\n\nSome companies told Business Insider that they've adopted certain benefits, such as greater access to medical care, which may help older workers stay healthy and avoid early retirement due to medical issues.\n\nThis can be beneficial to both companies and their workers. Older workers can increase corporate healthcare costs, since the majority of people aged 65 and older have a chronic disease, said Dr. Susan Mueller, senior director of health equity and well-being at global advisory firm WTW.\n\nWalgreens offers benefits for \"balancing work with caregiving responsibilities, preparing for retirement, or seeking proactive health and financial well-being support,\" a spokesperson said. UnitedHealth Group provides legal services for estate planning and family law, and supports workers navigating menopause or cancer diagnoses.\n\nA Google spokesperson said the company gives employees access to financial coaching for retirement and personalized assistance for managing caregiving. The company offers benefits such as cancer testing and support, no-cost medical second opinions, and no-cost virtual primary care.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson emphasized the company's paid time off for caregiving for loved ones with a serious illness and wraparound care to support healthy aging.\n\nFedEx has launched comprehensive medical benefits and support networks, such as its Choose Well Care Connect advocacy program, which guides members through life-altering diagnoses. FedEx launched a Fast Pass in certain markets to guarantee members a primary care appointment within 10 days or less. The company's corporate responsibility report notes that FedEx is testing home health capabilities in areas with limited healthcare opportunities.\n\nTopics like AI and climate change are garnering more attention in corporate America than the aging workforce, according to a Business Insider analysis of earnings calls, 10-Ks, and interviews.\n\nThat's a concern to some experts on aging, who say companies need to be doing more to prepare for shifting demographics.\n\nMueller said companies should develop programs that control costs for employees needing medical assistance; establish internal guidelines to help employees navigate the healthcare system; add virtual primary care; and hire external companies specializing in common medical conditions.\n\nMadonna Harrington Meyer, a sociology professor at Syracuse University, said that during economically hard times, older workers are often the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired.\n\nHarrington Meyer said companies should focus on accessibility and safety. They should arrange parking spots near office entrances, ensure good lighting and soundproofing for sensory needs, and maintain functional elevators.\n\nGraham Pearce, global defined benefit segment leader at the consulting firm Mercer, said some companies will need to confront an\"unconscious bias\" against older workers — often seen as less adaptable or more prone to illness. Progress may require legislative action, he said.\n\nThe bipartisan Protect Older Job Applicants Act was introduced in September to prohibit age-based applicant sorting for employers, ensure \"disparate impact\" protections apply to employees and applicants, and require government oversight on age discrimination claims.\n\nRep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia who co-led the bill, told Business Insider that he hopes age discrimination will be considered \"as illegal as discrimination based on race, color, creed, national origin, or sex.\" He added that if more people have employment opportunities later in life, it could stimulate the economy and help people age with dignity.\n\nIn September, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Americans Act, which would end forced arbitration clauses prohibiting victims of age discrimination from suing their employer.\n\n\"We know that forced arbitration often discriminates against the plaintiff, and for a lot of older Americans, they don't have the resources to mount significant litigations against an employer who discriminates against them,\" Gillibrand told Business Insider. \"We believe that if you have the right of the Constitution to go to a trial and to be judged by your peers, older Americans would do better in these lawsuits.\"\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said that the separate Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act would help level the playing field for older workers and combat age discrimination.\n\n\"We need to do more to make sure that every American can plan and save for a secure retirement, but as more and more of our neighbors are forced to work later in life just to make ends meet, we need to make sure everyone — regardless of their age — has protections and dignity in the workplace,\" Baldwin said.",

    "title": "The Pentagon says China has fielded a new long-range missile. Here's why the DF-27 is unusual.",
    "description": "The DF-27, a conventional strike missile believed to be able to target ships, has an estimated range that reaches parts of the continental US.",
    "fullText": "China appears to have fielded a new intercontinental ballistic missile, the DF-27, which can range the continental US and, unlike other ICBMs, serve a mix of missions, including targeting ships, a new Pentagon report says.\n\nThe Department of Defense's annual report on the Chinese military, the latest of which came out last week, is the first public assessment that the missile is operational. The missile is said to have a land-attack and anti-ship role.\n\nThe latter role is unusual for an intercontinental-range ballistic missile, as is its conventional strike role documented in the new Pentagon report. ICBMs are primarily for nuclear strike.\n\nThe latest report offers little on the new missile beyond a map showing China's \"fielded conventional strike.\" The DF-27, identified as an ICBM with a range of 5,000 to 8,000 km, shorter than some other systems built for strategic nuclear strike, is a new addition to that map showing Chinese missile ranges.\n\nThat range completely covers Hawaii and Alaska, and it also extends into parts of the continental US. The exact reach might vary depending on the launch site, but broadly, the weapon puts naval forces and US military installations across the Pacific at risk in a new way.\n\nA \"long-range\" DF-27 missile was first mentioned in the 2021 Pentagon report. It said that indications on the range hinted at either an intercontinental- or intermediate-range missile. That uncertainty persisted until the 2025 report identified it as an ICBM.\n\nThe 2024 Pentagon report notably offered the most detail, stating that the DF-27 had been \"deployed\" to the Rocket Force. It added that this weapon likely has an option for an HGV, a hypersonic glide vehicle, \"as well as conventional land-attack, conventional antiship, and nuclear capabilities.\" The 2025 report, however, did not put the weapon under \"fielded nuclear capabilities.\"\n\nAccording to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, the DF-27 carries potentially significant strategic implications.\n\nIn an early assessment of the Chinese missile published two years ago, the group cited a leaked intelligence briefing indicating the missile was tested in February 2023 and warned that it could give China another means to hold targets at risk beyond the second island chain, with a high likelihood of being able to penetrate US ballistic-missile defenses and the potential to serve as a \"carrier killer.\"\n\nChina has not publicly commented on the DF-27, though local media have at times approached the topic indirectly.\n\nFielding the new DF-27 makes China the first to have an operational, conventionally armed ICBM. The US and Russia have not fielded similar capabilities; however, both have been pursuing new intermediate-range capabilities since the collapse of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which the US walked away from in 2019 after accusing Russia of non-compliance.\n\nThe DF-27 is the latest example of China's efforts to develop and field varied, flexible strike options for a potential conflict. The missile branch of its military, called the People's Liberation Army's Rocket Force, has grown exponentially, and Chinese military doctrine emphasizes the need for it to possess the ability to quickly, precisely, and, in some cases, preemptively strike targets.\n\nWith the new DF-27 ICBM, \"China became the first to field an analogous capability: a conventional ICBM—with an ASBM variant—that can conduct rapid, long-range precision strikes out to intercontinental distances, including against its 'strong enemy's' homeland and its naval forces at sea,\" Andrew Erickson, a professor at the US Naval War College's China Maritime Studies Inistitute, wrote last week.\n\nSince the Pentagon's annual reports cover only developments from the previous year, the newest one doesn't include other notable missile developments in China from this year. An important development in September was Beijing's reveal of the DF-61 and DF-31BJ, both ICBMs, at a military parade.\n\nIt's unclear whether those missiles are operational, but even if they're still in development, the implications of the presentation in the Chinese capital are that these missiles will eventually be additions to China's already sizable land-based ICBM arsenal.",

    "description": "Amazon allows India-based employees affected by H-1B visa delays to work remotely until March, with strict restrictions on coding.",
    "fullText": "Amazon is allowing employees who are stranded in India because of visa delays to work remotely there until early March, according to an internal memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe catch: They're not allowed to code, make strategic decisions, or interact with customers.\n\nAmazon is one of many American companies scrambling to adapt to the Trump administration's rapid-fire changes to the H-1B visa program, including a mandate that consular officers must review visa applicants' social media posts before issuing visas. The additional screening has delayed processing, and some embassies and consulates have rescheduled visa appointments by several months, leaving some employees stranded outside the country.\n\nThe delays have prompted Google, Apple, Microsoft, and other companies to issue travel advisories in recent weeks, warning US employees with visas to avoid international travel to prevent extended stays outside the US.\n\nAmazon allows employees traveling abroad for visa renewals to work remotely for up to 20 business days, an exemption from the normal requirement that they work in their office five days a week. Now, any Amazon employee in India as of December 13 and who awaits a rescheduled visa appointment may work remotely until March 2, according to the memo, which was posted to Amazon's internal HR portal on December 17.\n\nThe permission to work remotely comes with a long list of constraints. Employees working remotely from India are barred from coding of any kind, including troubleshooting and testing. They cannot work from or visit Amazon buildings. And they cannot negotiate or sign contracts.\n\n\"All reviews, final decision making, and sign offs should be undertaken outside India,\" the memo says.\n\nThe memo also said that \"in compliance with local laws, there are no exceptions to these restrictions.\"\n\nThe memo does not provide guidance for employees whose visa appointments have been rescheduled beyond March 2, 2026, or for those stranded in a different country. Some US embassies and consulates have rescheduled appointments as far out as 2027.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nFor employees in technical roles, the restrictions raised questions about what work they can actually perform.\n\n\"Seventy to eighty percent of my job is coding, testing, deploying, and documenting,\" one Amazon software engineer told Business Insider.\n\nA State Department spokesperson in December told Business Insider that the purpose of the social media reviews is to use \"all available tools\" to flag visa applicants who are inadmissible, including those who pose a risk to national interests.\n\nThe delays pose a particular challenge for Amazon, which is among the largest users of the H-1B program. During the 2024 government fiscal year, Amazon filed 14,783 certified H-1B applications, including 23 for Whole Foods, according to Business Insider's analysis of publicly available data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "The College Football Playoff quarterfinals kick off with a Miami (Fla.) vs. Ohio State showdown. We've compiled everything you need to know about how to watch the Cotton Bowl, including live streaming options for those without cable.\n\nThe No. 10 Miami Hurricanes will take on the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes, the reigning Cotton Bowl and National Champions. Miami has had a great run this year, only dropping two games during the regular season and defeating No. 7 Texas A&M 10-3 in the first round of the playoffs. Ohio State has also offered up a worthy season, winning 12 games in a row before fumbling their last regular-season game against No. 1 Indiana. Whether they can shake off the loss and repeat last year's success remains to be seen, but we'll make sure you can tune in so you don't miss a second of the action.\n\nKeep reading to learn the best ways to live stream tonight's game. The streaming options we highlight will also allow you to watch the remainder of the College Football Playoff games, from the New Year's Day quarterfinals to the National Championship.\n\nThe Cotton Bowl will air on ESPN in the US. The Miami vs. Ohio State game is scheduled to kick off on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nIf you don't have cable, there are several avenues to explore when it comes to live streaming the Cotton Bowl. ESPN Unlimited is ESPN's direct counterpart and a must-have for cord-cutting sports fans. Subscriptions cost $30 a month and unlock all things ESPN, as well as ESPN2, the ACC Network, the SEC Network, ABC on ESPN content, ESPN Plus streaming exclusives, and much more. You can also save with a limited-time deal when you bundle ESPN Unlimited with Disney Plus and Hulu.\n\nESPN Unlimited has everything from ESPN Plus, in addition to all that the ESPN linear networks have to offer.\n\nIf you'd prefer to watch through a streaming service that carries other channels (in addition to ESPN) or offers a free trial, then a live TV streaming service will be able to do the trick. DirecTV and Fubo are two of the best live TV streaming services we've tested that also offer free trials to new customers.\n\nDirecTV MySports carries ESPN and around 20 other key networks (like TNT, the NFL Network, and local channels where applicable) in its sports-centric genre pack. The plan also unlocks access to ESPN Unlimited at no extra cost. Subscriptions cost $70 a month, but new users can get their first two months for $60 a month after a five-day free trial.\n\nDirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network.\n\nFubo Sports + News is another genre-specific plan with robust sports offerings and ESPN Unlimited access. The plan offers ESPN and around 28 other popular channels. Subscriptions cost $56 a month, but new users can get their first month for $46 after a one-day free trial.\n\nThe new Fubo Sports + News pack is only available in select areas. It combines 20+ major sports channels (including the new ESPN Unlimited) and select local networks (ABC, CBS, and FOX).\n\nCFP fans traveling away from home don't need to miss out on any of the action with the help of a VPN, or virtual private network. VPNs are handy tech tools that let people change their device's virtual location so that they operate just like they would back home. This way, viewers can keep up with all their usual websites and apps from anywhere. Since the services we've highlighted require country-specific payment methods, this option will work best for those who are simply traveling abroad at the moment and hoping to use their existing subscriptions.\n\nIf you're not sure where to start when it comes to VPNs, our go-to recommendation this year has been NordVPN. It's a top-notch option with a massive selection of servers and cybersecurity perks. Plus, it's user-friendly and comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can learn more about the app in our NordVPN review.\n\nNordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs.",

    "description": "Box-office numbers stagnated in 2025, but standout films such as \"Sinners,\" \"Sorry, Baby,\" and \"Splitsville\" prove that creative cinema still thrives.",
    "fullText": "Every December, cinephiles ask: Was this a good year for movies? By the end of 2025, I knew my answer instantly: Yes.\n\nThe box office told a different story. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, annual box-office grosses routinely reached $10 to $11 billion. This year, totals are expected to fall short of $9 billion.\n\n\"It looks like it's going to be two years in a row that the industry flatlined,\" Alamo Drafthouse COO Michael Sherrill told Variety.\n\nBut if you look beyond the box-office numbers, you'd see the year was packed with wonderful movies. And it's just one reason we should be paying less attention to what the box office tells us.\n\nNot every year has a \"Barbenheimer,\" which together raked in $2.4 billion at the box office in 2023, but that doesn't mean there weren't plenty of five-star films in 2025.\n\nSome of the best movies of the year included \"28 Years Later,\" \"Blue Moon,\" \"Sentimental Value,\" \"Splitsville,\" \"Hamnet,\" \"If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,\" \"Black Bag,\" and \"Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning,\" and all but two made less than $11 million worldwide.\n\n\"The Final Reckoning,\" which grossed $598 million at the box office, was still unable to become profitable due to ballooning production costs, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAnother, \"Black Bag,\" was a slick thriller starring Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett as a pair of married spies who are pitted against each other when a mole is discovered. This film was visually stunning, featured strong performances, and the tension never let up.\n\nWhen it was released in March, \"Black Bag\" earned $44 million at the box office, likely because it catered to, for lack of a better term, \"adults.\" Yet Gen Z and Gen Alpha are the generations \"sort of single-handedly keeping film alive\" more than any others, according to reports from CinemaUnited and the National Research Group, suggesting there may be a ceiling on how far adult-focused theatrical releases like \"Black Bag\" can go today. By comparison, another Soderbergh-directed thriller, \"Out of Sight,\" made nearly double that in 1998.\n\nAnother great 2025 film, \"Sorry, Baby,\" was a movie written by, directed by, and starring Eva Victor in their directorial debut. Victor played a college professor grappling with the aftermath of a sexual assault. It was simultaneously heartbreaking, funny, and uplifting.\n\nIt also only made $3 million at the box office — a respectable total for a small indie film with a reported budget of $1.5 million and a very limited theatrical run, but not a smash by any means.\n\nAnother movie that made $3 million? \"Splitsville,\" which made me laugh harder than almost anything else I saw this year.\n\nWhat I learned from these movies: Don't let the \"flop\" label or a small box-office number scare you. Just because it didn't have \"Avengers: Endgame\"-level marketing, fanfare, and box-office take-home, it doesn't mean it's not worth your time.\n\nIn fact, even some of the biggest hits of the year could be considered flops by Old Hollywood standards.\n\nMovies like \"Superman,\" \"The Fantastic Four: First Steps,\" and \"Captain America: Brave New World\" each earned hundreds of millions of dollars globally but fell far short of the blockbuster heights superhero films once enjoyed.\n\nArguably the best superhero movie of the year, \"Thunderbolts*,\" made $382 million worldwide, making it a superhero flop according to outlets like Variety and Screen Crush.\n\nOver the last decade, viewers' habits have changed; more people stay home and stream their favorite films, rather than head to theaters.\n\nWith the advent of streaming, fewer people are interested in going to cinemas. A US Kagan Consumer Insights survey, released in October, found that the percentage of frequent movie-goers dropped by 22% between 2019 and 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, in July 2025, Netflix reported its best-ever numbers during an earnings call. Free streaming services like YouTube and Tubi increased viewership by 53% between 2023 and 2024, and Peacock gained 3 million subscribers in just the first week of the Olympics.\n\nThe era when every major release was expected to make a billion dollars is over.\n\nThis comes as there's more focus on the theater box office and studio budgets. Over the past decade, trade publications have leaned into coverage of how much money a movie needs to earn \"to make its money back.\"\n\nThis reporting only opens up films like Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" a record-breaking, singular film that depicts an area of the country rarely shown on screen, to bad-faith criticism, as viewers use data to tear a movie down, regardless of quality.\n\nIt not only ignores creative value but also obscures other stories, such as how Coogler secured a rights deal to own the rights in 2050, which could set a new precedent for how creatives take ownership of their work.\n\nInstead, the narrative was about how this film, which grossed over $360 million on a $90 million budget, per IndieWire, wasn't close to making its money back.\n\n\"Sinners\" has amassed $61 million in its global debut. It's a great result for an original, R-rated horror film, yet the Warner Bros. release has a $90 million price tag before global marketing expenses, so profitability remains a ways away. https://t.co/gjPXGBYkZ1 pic.twitter.com/wwXjVC2GT5\n\nso in order for the film to break even (70M budget), it will have to gross 175M, but that doesn’t include the marketing costs, so the break even point is prob +200M. so happy timotheé is getting a financial failure attatched to his face 🙏🏻 https://t.co/ZvYV2sUQqf\n\nThis phenomenon isn't completely new. In Nancy Meyers' \"The Holiday,\" a film released almost 20 years ago, a character complains we shouldn't be tracking box-office returns like baseball scores: \"Now a picture has to make a killing the first weekend or it's dead. This is supposed to be conducive to great work?\"\n\nStill, with movies like \"Sinners\" and \"Black Bag\" in our rear-view mirrors, we should remind ourselves that box-office success shouldn't matter to us cinema lovers — we should only care about how the movies are making us feel and think.\n\nSo, as 2026 begins, stop worrying and love the bomb — and an entire world of cinema will be opened up to you.",

    "title": "Do You Really Need to Check With a Doctor Before Starting to Exercise?",
    "description": "Just because everybody says it, doesn't always mean it's true.",
    "fullText": "I’m sure you’ve heard it everywhere: Check with a doctor before beginning any exercise program. This is the standard disclaimer on fitness advice of any sort, which most of us probably ignore. But should you? Not necessarily, it turns out.\n\nThe concern underlying this oft-repeated statement is that there are rare cases where a person can die suddenly during exercise. When this happens, it’s usually in a person who (a) had some kind of underlying medical issue; (b) was not used to exercising; and (c) did very intense exercise that they were unprepared for.\n\nFor a long time, there was a sense among many medical and fitness professionals that the best way to handle the issue was to focus on the first part: the people who had an underlying medical issue. And because not everybody knows if they have one, you should also see a doctor if you might have an underlying medical issue. Or if you had a family history of a medical issue.\n\nWhile it sounds like a good idea, the screening got out of hand. One of the most common screening tools was a questionnaire that would ask about your own health as well as things like how old you were, whether you had smoked, and whether you were overweight. One study from 2014 found that it would flag more than 90% of middle-aged and older adults. In other words, these are people who wouldn’t be permitted to exercise until and unless they got a medical clearance.\n\nWith the price and availability of healthcare in this country (not to mention difficulties involved in getting an appointment, taking time off work if needed, and so on) that’s a huge barrier for a lot of people. Pretty ironic, considering that exercise is good for your health.\n\nThe American College of Sports Medicine did a deeper dive into the numbers, and found that the risks they were screening for were very common; the outcomes they were trying to prevent were very rare (one sudden cardiac death per 1.5 million vigorous workouts, in one study), and screening people based on risk factors didn’t actually seem to reduce the number of people dying during exercise.\n\nThe current guidelines for screening people before exercise have been changed. The American College of Sports Medicine now says “most people can exercise without visiting a doctor first.” The current guidelines—which most gyms and trainers should be using—only use three factors to screen people:\n\nHow much you exercise currently\n\nWhether you have signs or symptoms of certain health conditions\n\nHow intensely you would like to exercise\n\nThe health conditions that trigger that second bullet point are cardiovascular, metabolic, and kidney diseases. If you have diabetes, that’s a metabolic disease. If you have been told you have a heart condition, peripheral artery disease, or cerebrovascular disease, that counts as a cardiovascular disease.\n\nEven if you have one of these health conditions, you can usually exercise if you’ve gotten clearance from your doctor in the last 12 months (and your condition hasn’t worsened since then), or if you already exercise regularly and you just want to continue at the same level. There is a flowchart here to walk you through the question of whether you need medical clearance.\n\nEven without a prior diagnosis, signs and symptoms of those previously mentioned diseases mean that you should stop exercising and check with a doctor before continuing. These include shortness of breath at rest or with mild activity; chest, arm, or jaw pain; dizziness or fainting; and others. If you’re curious if you would qualify, start by taking the PAR-Q test, which is seven yes-or-no questions; if you answer yes to any of them, there is a slightly longer questionnaire called the PAR-Q+ that gets more detailed.\n\nCompared to the old guidelines, the proportion of people over 40 who need to get medical clearance before exercise has been cut almost in half. And as part of the same guidelines, the doctor’s visit itself will probably be a lot simpler. Specific tests are no longer recommended; what happens at that visit is up to your provider and their clinical judgment.\n\nSo, yes, some people do still need to check with a doctor before starting an exercise program. But it’s nowhere near everybody. Most people can get started right away, and even people with medical conditions will likely be told that there is some kind of exercise they can do.",

    "description": "Alexandr Wang says Neuralink and other brain-computer interfaces will help kids learn in \"crazy ways.\"",
    "fullText": "It's no surprise that wunderkinds want their children to be wunderkinds, too.\n\nAsAlexandr Wang, the 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, takes on a new role at Meta leading its superintelligence initiatives, he's also thinking about how to integrate superintelligence into the next generation.\n\nAnd that means he's not having kids anytime soon.\n\nOn the Shawn Ryan Show on Thursday, Wang said he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink or other brain-computer interfaces are available.\n\nNeuralink, one of Elon Musk's most futuristic endeavors, is developing coin-sized microchips that can be embedded into human brains. These chips will not only be able to record brain activity, but also stimulate it.\n\nStill in clinical trials, Neuralink has so far been embedded in seven patients. One of those patients, Brad Smith, who has ALS, said he was able to edit a video using his Neuralink brain chip.\n\nWhile Neuralink has received a ton of buzz, it's not the only one developing these interfaces. Synchron, backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is already working with Apple to help those with disabilities, like ALS patients, use their iPhones. Motif Neurotech is developing a neurostimulator system that works like a pacemaker for the brain and is now used for treating severe depression.\n\nWang also believes these devices will have profound implications for child development. \"In your first like seven years of life, your brain is more neuroplastic than at any other point in your life,\" he said. \"When we get Neuralink and we get these other technologies, kids who are born with them are gonna learn how to use them in like crazy, crazy ways.\"\n\nNeuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to adapt and change — whether that means rewiring its structure, shifting how it functions, or forming new connections — in response to things happening inside us or around us.\n\nIt's often enhanced in children because the \"organization of networks of neuronal synapses as well as white matter pathways remain 'under construction' well into adolescence and even later,\" according to a 2009 article published in the peer-reviewed journal Brain and Development. This is why children are also able to learn new skills quickly and recover from injuries faster.\n\nHowever, machines aren't the \"obvious answer\" to enhancing neuroplasticity, Dr. Matthew MacDougall, the head surgeon at Neuralink, told neuroscientist Andrew Huberman on his podcast in April. Even with implanted electrodes and computers, \"It's hard to know which area of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation target for an electrode to broadly juice plasticity,\" he said. Pharmacologic agents, including drugs like LSD and Psilocybin, which can impact the whole brain, are the most promising area of plasticity research, he added.\n\n\"I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,\" he said. \"You're never going to get that broad targetability with any electrodes that I can see coming in our lifetimes.\"",

    "fullText": "Wednesday, December 31st 2025\n\n Leaks Predict $5000 RTX 5090 GPUs in 2026 Thanks to AI Industry Demand\n\n by Cpt.Jank\n\n Today, 13:33\n\n Discuss (26 Comments)\n\n It's no secret that gaming is suffering under something of an affordability crisis, with increased demand for AI-capable GPUs and DDR5 memory resulting in rising prices for gamers and other far-reaching side effects on the gaming hardware market. Now, though, fresh leaks suggest that things are only going to get worse in 2026. According to Korean publication, Newsis, both AMD and NVIDIA are planning to gradually and permanently increase GPU prices \"over the next several months.\" This is expected to start as early as January 2026, when AMD is expected to increase prices. NVIDIA will allegedly follow suit in February. \n\nIf the publication's insider sources are correct, the NVIDIA RTX 5090, which launched at $1,999, will reach as high as $5,000 before the end of the year. No prediction has been made for AMD's RX 9000 series, but memory has already been said to take up as much as 80% of the average GPU BOM cost, and memory prices are expected to increase by as much as 40% by Q2 2026. We've already reported on the fact that instability and price increases in the DRAM market will likely affect launch windows for upcoming hardware, potentially reaching as far as next-gen console launches, and ASUS recently announced that it would be increasing hardware prices starting in early January 2026, despite also increasing DDR4 motherboard production in response to the changing market.",

    "fullText": "This has to be one of the most charged debates in the U.S. auto industry this year. Scout Motors’ decision to sell cars directly to customers triggered fierce backlash from franchise dealers, highlighting long-simmering tensions between traditional retail networks and emerging direct-to-consumer business models.\n\nThe clash sharpened in Colorado, where the state Motor Vehicle Dealer Board’s decision to grant Scout a dealer license unsettled established dealers, while raising broader questions about the future of auto retailing.\n\nScout Motors is a Volkswagen Group-backed EV brand. The company deliberately pursued a sales approach more commonly associated with Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid.\n\nUnlike conventional manufacturers that rely on independent franchise dealers to sell and service vehicles, Scout intends to manage everything from reservations to delivery through its own facilities and online platform. That model promises transparent pricing, streamlined transactions, and a more controlled experience for customers.\n\nBut dealers see a threat to the industry’s longstanding franchise system, which they argue has underpinned local economies, provided guaranteed service networks, and protected consumers.\n\nOn a recent episode of Inside Automotive, industry veteran Mike Maroone, CEO of Mike Maroone Auto and former AutoNation executive, described Colorado’s regulatory approval as a “circumvention of the traditional franchise system” that undermines dealer investments and protections established over decades.\n\nHe dismissed Scout’s claims of operating separately from its corporate parent, Volkswagen, using a familiar saying to make his point: “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.”\n\nMaroone’s critique reflects a fundamental dispute about corporate structure and brand identity. Scout insists that it is a distinct brand with its own business model, but dealers counter that financial backing from Volkswagen and deep operational ties make that distinction superficial. They argue that allowing a manufacturer-backed brand to bypass the dealer network sets a worrying precedent that could unravel protections franchisees rely on.\n\nThe Colorado decision is especially significant because the state boasts one of the strongest electric vehicle markets in the country, with roughly 27 percent of all vehicle sales being electric. Federal and state incentives have helped fuel demand, though shifts in incentive structures have recently moderated growth. Even in a strong market, dealers feel pressured as new direct sales approaches gain regulatory footholds.\n\nMaroone has proposed that dealers consider a multipronged response that could include litigation, negotiation, and political advocacy. He underscored the value of dealer associations in unifying opposition and leveraging political capital to defend the status quo. In his view, the threat is existential rather than theoretical, with manufacturer-owned direct sales potentially eroding the economic foundations of independent dealers.\n\nThe friction goes beyond Colorado. Dealer groups nationwide, including the National Automobile Dealers Association, have pledged to challenge Scout’s direct-to-consumer strategy in courts and statehouses across the country. These challenges echo earlier disputes over Tesla and other electric vehicle makers that have similarly eschewed franchise networks, testing state franchise laws that were drafted long before internet-based sales were possible.\n\nIn some states, dealers have already escalated their opposition into litigation. For example, in Florida, Volkswagen and Audi dealers filed a lawsuit claiming Scout’s direct sales violated state law by accepting deposits for vehicles not yet in production. They contended that taking deposits constituted sales under state definitions and sought injunctions to halt the practice. The dispute underscored how legal interpretations of sales activity vary widely across states.\n\nScout’s supporters argue that the direct model aligns with evolving consumer expectations shaped by online retail and digital services. They contend that eliminating intermediaries can reduce friction and cost while offering buyers a more transparent experience. Scout’s leadership has expressed optimism about consumer demand for its Terra pickup and Traveler SUV, even as dealer pushback grows.\n\nAt its core, the conflict encapsulates a broader industry transformation. Traditional dealers emphasize their local economic impact and service capacity. Direct-to-consumer proponents highlight efficiency and modern customer engagement. As Scout and similar brands expand, the legal, economic, and political wrangling will likely continue, shaping how Americans buy vehicles in the decades ahead.",

    "fullText": "Dr. Helen Eisenhauer, a general practitioner at Stenhouse Medical Centre in the U.K., is facing a five-month suspension after she admitted to faking two appointments in order to be able to pick up her kids on time\n\n“The incident occurred over one year ago at a time of particular stress for me when I was having to balance the demands of my young family with busy professional commitments,” she admitted during a hearing\n\nIn a statement, the medical center said they have \"provided ongoing support\" to the doctor and that they maintain \"full confidence in her clinical capabilities\"\n\nA doctor in England was suspended after admitting to having booked fake appointments so she could leave work in time to pick up her kids.\n\nDr. Helen Eisenhauer, a general practitioner at Stenhouse Medical Centre in Arnold, is facing a five-month suspension after she booked two appointments last year with patients she had already consulted in order to ensure she could pick up her children by 6 p.m., according to a misconduct case heard by the General Medical Counsel.\n\n\"The incident occurred over one year ago at a time of particular stress for me when I was having to balance the demands of my young family with busy professional commitments. I fully accept however that this does not excuse my dishonesty,\" Eisenhauer said in a statement to the medical tribunal. \"I am thoroughly ashamed of my behaviour in July 2024 and am determined to never compromise the medical profession or myself again.\"\n\nThe incident took place on July 17, 2024, according to the tribunal records.\n\nThat day, Eisenhauer was scheduled to finish work at 4:45 p.m. and she admitted to feeling \"worried\" she wouldn't be able to leave in time if she ended up getting booked for any last-minute appointments.\n\nShe went on to book two face-to-face appointments for the end of her shift, even though she'd already consulted with both patients earlier that day.\n\nTwo days later, a fellow partner at her practice noticed there were no notes from one of the appointments.\n\n\"I recall feeling embarrassed and worried about what my colleagues would think of me having made the booking,\" Eisenhauer said at the hearing, going on to share that she did go on to add in the notes, even though the consultation never happened.\n\n\"I did this in the middle of my full working day without thinking it through,\" she said. \"I did not consider the consequences of writing this entry at the time. I recollect only my worry and embarrassment.\"\n\nWhen her actions ultimately resulted in a “disciplinary meeting” at her practice, Dr. Eisenhauer — who initially denied any wrongdoing — referred herself to the General Medical Council on July 17, 2024.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nEisenhauer stated during a cross examination that there was nothing unusual about the day of the incident and that she had simply failed to make an appropriate fallback provision for childcare.\n\n“I am fully aware of the importance of honesty and probity in my personal and professional life, and the impact that dishonest actions can have on the profession and the public trust in the profession,” she continued. “I am thoroughly ashamed of my behaviour in July 2024 and am determined to never compromise the medical profession or myself again.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, her legal representative alleged that Eisenhaur had not been sleeping well and that had she failed to pick up her kids on time that day, she “may have lost that childcare provision.”\n\nIn a statement, tribunal chairman Neil Dalton said that Eisenhauer \"displayed a reckless disregard for patient safety and professional standards.\"\n\n\"Her actions undermined collaborative working, betraying the trust her colleagues needed to place in her probity as they worked alongside her daily,\" Dalton added.\n\nIn their final judgement, the tribunal considered all of the factors, including the “falsification of records” – and said that they did consider taking no action due to the “exceptional circumstances” of the case. However, ultimately they decided upon a five-month suspension.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 31, Stenhouse Medical Centre shared a social media statement regarding the incident.\n\n“When concerns were first raised in July 2024, the Practice undertook a comprehensive internal investigation following which appropriate action was taken including a self-referral to the GMC by Dr. Eisenhauer,” the practice wrote on Facebook. “In the intervening period, the Partners have provided ongoing support to Dr. Eisenhauer and have maintained full confidence in her clinical capabilities.”\n\n“Our focus continues to be supporting the wellbeing of Dr. Eisenhauer, our staff and patients whilst delivering compassionate, safe and reliable care,” they added.\n\nStenhouse Medical Centre did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for additional comment.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has ended the lease agreement for three public golf courses in Washington, a move that offers President Donald Trump an additional opportunity to put his stamp on another piece of the nation's capital.\n\nThe National Links Trust, the nonprofit that has operated Washington's three public courses on federal land for the last five years, said Wednesday that the Department of the Interior had terminated its 50-year lease agreement. The Interior Department said it was terminating the lease because the nonprofit had not implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease.\n\nWhile it was unclear what the Trump administration's plans are for the golf courses, the move gives Trump, whose private company has developed numerous golf courses in the U.S. and abroad, the chance to remake links overlooking the Potomac River and in Rock Creek Park and a site that is part of Black golf history.\n\nOfficials for the National Links Trust said in a statement that they were “devastated” by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses. They said $8.5 million had gone toward capital improvements at the courses and that rounds played and revenue had more than doubled in their tenure managing the courses. The nonprofit has agreed to keep managing the courses for the time being, but long-term renovations will stop.\n\n“While this termination is a major setback, we remain stubbornly hopeful that a path forward can be found that preserves affordable and accessible public golf in the nation’s capital for generations to come,” the officials added.\n\nThe Department of the Interior's decision comes as Trump rebrands civic spaces in Washington and deploys National Guard members to the streets for public safety. The Kennedy Center added Trump's name this month after the center's board of trustees — made up of Trump appointees — voted to change the name of the performing arts space designated by Congress as a memorial to John F. Kennedy. Trump is also in the midst of a construction project to build a ballroom on the White House's East Wing, and he has put his name on the U.S. Institute of Peace.",

    "fullText": "New England Patriots defensive lineman Christian J. Barmore is facing a domestic assault and battery charge after his girlfriend told police he threw her to the ground in August at his home outside Boston.\n\nA criminal complaint issued Dec. 18 claims Barmore, 26, briefly took the woman's phone, threw her to the ground and grabbed her by the shirt inside the home in Mansfield, Massachusetts.\n\nMansfield Police Sgt. John Armstrong said the woman called police on Aug. 25 to report what had occurred almost three weeks earlier. The woman told police she had stayed at the home periodically during their relationship of several years.\n\nBarmore's lawyer, David Meier, issued a statement Wednesday saying “the evidence will demonstrate that no criminal conduct took place.” Meier called it a personal matter and said he expected it to be \"resolved in the near future and both parties will move forward together.”\n\nThe woman told police she took their daughter early the morning of Aug. 8 into Barmore's bedroom, where Barmore was upset because the thermostat was 2 degrees warmer than he preferred. She said their daughter wanted to see him.\n\nShe claimed Barmore “picked up the child, placed her on the floor just outside the master bedroom, turned back into the room and slammed the door shut,” according to police.\n\nAs the woman packed her belongings to leave later in the day, Barmore took the phone from her hand and disconnected a call with the woman's mother, according to the criminal complaint. When she headed for the front door to call for help, police said, Barmore allegedly “grabbed her before she could and threw her to the floor.\"\n\nBarmore grabbed her by the shirt but “eventually let go” and the woman got up, she told police. A car provided by the team picked up the woman and their daughter and drove them to Delaware. She provided police with a photo showing bruises she said occurred when she was thrown to the floor.\n\nNew England coach Mike Vrabel said Barmore was away from the team with an illness Wednesday but that he hadn’t heard anything that would make him unavailable to play Sunday.\n\n“We’ve made a statement and we’ve taken the allegations very seriously,” Vrabel said, referring to allegations against both Barmore and receiver Stefon Diggs. Diggs has been charged with felony strangulation or suffocation and misdemeanor assault and battery in a dispute with his former private chef.\n\n“I don’t think we have to jump to any sort of conclusions right now. Let the process take its toll,” Vrabel said.\n\nAn arraignment was scheduled for early February. The charge is a misdemeanor.\n\nThe team's public relations office emailed a statement saying it had been aware of the matter when it occurred and notified the league.\n\n“The matter remains part of an ongoing legal process. We will respect that process, continue to monitor the situation closely, as we have over the past few months, and cooperate fully with the league,” the Patriots said.\n\nBarmore was a second-round pick in 2021 out of the University of Alabama.\n\nScolforo reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

    "fullText": "Whenever consumers need to complete a simple automobile maintenance task, such as replacing windshield wiper blades or an air filter, they just need to run over to the local Napa Auto Parts, Auto Zone, or O'Reilly Auto Parts store, buy the product, and install it.\n\nOn some occasions, I've discovered one store might not have the part, but another will probably have it.\n\nBut on other occasions, when I'm having car repairs, a mechanic might not be able to find an auto part locally and needs to have it shipped in from a manufacturer in maybe Michigan or Ohio, which can take a few days.\n\nThe auto industry faced severe supply chain issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, which created auto parts shortages. Unfortunately, the problems didn't go away after the pandemic subsided, as supply chain issues and parts and components shortages continue to drag down the industry.\n\nIssues that created parts and component shortages include material shortages, labor gaps, port congestion, geopolitical uncertainty, and the surge in electric vehicle development, Supply Chain World reported.\n\nSupply challenges have contributed to economic issues for the auto parts industry in 2025, as some suppliers have needed to file for bankruptcy protection or, in some cases, downsize operations.\n\nGlobal giant auto parts company Marelli Holdings Co. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 11, listing $4.9 billion in funded debt, with plans to hand the company over to its senior lenders.\n\nThe debtor blamed its distress on the effects of the Covid pandemic and post-pandemic market challenges and headwinds, including supply chain challenges, labor shortages, high costs, inflation, rising prices of raw materials, and declining customer volumes. It also blamed tariffs.\n\nAnother huge auto parts company First Brands Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sept. 25 with about $6 billion in debt.\n\nFirst Brands makes auto parts products, such as Michelin licensed wiper blades, Raybestos complete brake solutions, Centric Parts replacement brake components, StopTech performance brakes, Fram filtration products, AirTex and Carter fuel and water pumps, Autolite spark plugs, Lube-finer filtration products, Trico wiper blades Anco wiper blades, Carson brake hardware, and Cardone new and remanufactured replacement parts.\n\nRaybestos complete brake solutions\n\nCentric Parts replacement brake components\n\nAirTex and Carter fuel and water pumps\n\nCardone new and remanufactured replacement parts\n\nAnother major auto parts and components supplier isn't filing for bankruptcy, but is shutting down a major facility.\n\nCooper Standard Automotive Inc., a leading provider of automotive products for sealing, fluid handling, and specialized rubber and plastic components, will close its New Lexington, Ohio, manufacturing plant and lay off about 228 employees, the company revealed in a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act letter sent to Ohio state officials.\n\nThe subsidiary of Northville, Mich.-based Cooper Standard issued the letter on Dec. 8 to the Ohio Department of Job & Family Services that it would begin layoffs on Feb. 6, 2026, and continue terminating workers until the New Lexington plant closes on about July 1, 2027.\n\n\"Cooper Standard is continually analyzing plant utilization and looking for opportunities to optimize our manufacturing footprint and overall operating efficiency,\" the letter said.\n\n\"As a result, the company has made the difficult decision to close our New Lexington, Ohio, Facility,\" the letter continued.\n\nCooper Standard will notify the United Auto Workers Local 1686 of affected employees 60 days or more before their last day of employment, according to the WARN letter.\n\nBumping rights, which allow senior employees whose jobs are eliminated to take positions from less senior employees to keep a job at a company, exist under the collective bargaining agreement between Cooper Standard and UAW Local 1686.\n\nAlso, hourly employees and salaried employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to other Cooper Standard facilities, based on certain eligibility requirements, the letter said.\n\nThe company currently employs 193 hourly workers and 35 salaried workers.\n\nCasual Mexican restaurant chain closes more locations\n\n79-year-old national trucking company closes down, no bankruptcy\n\n65-year-old Home Depot rival shutters business permanently\n\nCooper Standard is a global leader in providing advanced sealing and fluid handling systems for transportation markets that include automotive vehicles, truck and bus, mass transit, electrification, and recreational vehicles, such as mobile RVs, marine, and powersports.\n\nThe company's automotive products include fuel and brake delivery systems, fluid transfer systems, custom rubber and plastic seals, spliced O-rings/corners, custom molded profiles, die-cut, rubber-to-metal bonding, overmolding, molded details, dual and tri-durometer seals, clip-on seals, push-pin solutions, and vibration isolation and dampening.\n\nFuel and brake delivery systems\n\nCustom rubber and plastic seals\n\nVibration isolation and dampening\n\nIt also provides products for industrial and consumer goods, such as appliances, electronics, renewable energy, foodservice, point-of-purchase, enclosures, and heavy equipment, such as agricultural and construction uses.\n\nCooper Standard also provides building and construction products for HVAC, windows and doors, and lighting.\n\nThe company, established in 1960, employs a total of 22,000 workers in 20 countries.",

    "fullText": "A traveler passing through Newark Liberty International Airport tested positive for measles – one of the world’s most infectious diseases – earlier this month, officials said.\n\nThe patient zero passenger was in terminals B and C on Dec. 12, according to a press release from the New Jersey Department of Health.\n\n“Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a rash that usually appears between three and five days after symptoms begin,” health officials warned in the release.\n\n“The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet.”\n\nThe airborne virus can spread when someone coughs or sneezes – and lingers in the air for up to two hours after the infected person leaves the area.\n\nOfficials implored anyone who suspects they were exposed to the illness to call their health provider before visiting a medical care center or hospital.\n\n“NJDOH is working in collaboration with local health officials on ongoing contact tracing and on efforts to notify people who might have been exposed and to identify additional exposures that may have occurred,” officials said in the release.\n\nThe NJDOH said that anyone who is not fully vaccinated or has not contracted measles in the past are at risk.\n\nWhile measles is highly contagious, the infection produces decades-long immunity – but the two-dose vaccine offers lifelong immunity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThis year, there have been 11 confirmed cases of measles in New Jersey, according to NJDOH.\n\nA record 8.03 million travelers are expected to fly across America this holiday season, according to AAA.\n\nNewark isn’t the only major airport to report detections of the viral disease during the holidays.\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed that a visitor from Texas was diagnosed with measles after flying into the Boston Logan International Airport on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe traveler was on American Airlines Flight 2384, which departed from Dallas-Fort Worth, according to a release from the MDOPH.\n\nAs of Dec. 30, there have been 2,065 measles cases in the US in every state except Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina and West Virginia, according to the CDC.\n\nThe US previously touted its elimination of the virus 25 years ago. Declining vaccination rates killed the celebrated herd immunity – resulting in a three-decade high of measles cases.",

    "description": "After Joe Biden was called out on Fox News for going on a holiday vacation, many on social media rallied around the former president.",
    "fullText": "After Joe Biden was called out on Fox News for going on a holiday vacation, many on social media rallied around the former president and slammed host Tomi Lahren for mocking the retired politician.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s broadcast of “Hannity,” Lahren openly mocked Biden for his end-of-year trip, noting, “And you’ll never believe where Joe Biden was spotted. Spoiler alert: He’s on vacation.”\n\nThis moment was clipped and shared on X Tuesday evening — and swiftly went viral, gaining 4 million views in less than 24 hours. Many were confused by Lahren’s dig, given Biden is not currently president and has withdrawn significantly from public life amid his cancer battle.\n\nOne critic responded on X, “quick question @TomiLahren what year do you think it is?” Another chimed in with, “Spoiler alert: he’s not president.” A third added, “Retired man goes on vacation. Hardly a scandal.”\n\nA fourth expressed a more biting sentiment, noting, “I’m pretty sure they call that retirement, you dumb hack.”\n\nAnother X user called out conservatives for giving Biden a hard time for doing exactly what they asked him to do: “Sleepy Joe Biden needs to retire so we can pile on to make fun of him for not working anymore.”\n\nThe irony of Lahren’s comments weren’t lost on other social media users, who pointed out that the conservative commentator was covering for Sean Hannity — who was reportedly absent for being on vacation. Watch the viral moment below.\n\nLahren: And you will never believe where Joe Biden was spotted. Spoiler alert. He's on vacation pic.twitter.com/C4RSpWi7St\n\n— Acyn (@Acyn) December 31, 2025\n\nBiden notably exited the 2024 presidential race after concerns surfaced following his performance during a June 2024 debate against Donald Trump.\n\n“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” Biden said in a letter confirming his withdrawal from the race. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”\n\nBiden’s Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in and ran in his place, but ultimately lost to Trump, who was inaugurated for his second term in January.\n\nThe post Fox News Mocked for Ripping Into Joe Biden’s Holiday Vacation: ‘They Call That Retirement’ appeared first on TheWrap.",
