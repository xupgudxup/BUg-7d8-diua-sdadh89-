When peers face things like product recalls, fraud, or accidents, stakeholders often assume others may be at risk, including your brand. This erodes stakeholder support and trust. This “interorganizational spillover” occurs because stakeholders rely on cognitive shortcuts when forming judgments: the failure of one firm signals that others in the same peer group may have similar problems. Firms can’t prevent peers from stumbling, but they can contain the fallout by monitoring and diagnosing early, responding with decisive actions, and converting peer crises into opportunities.",

A study of 27,000 healthcare workers during the pandemic found that feeling psychologically safe significantly reduces burnout and turnover, even when resources are severely constrained. Employees who felt safe enough to voice concerns also proved to be  more resilient and more likely to stay in their jobs. Building this “social resource” before a crisis pays dividends when uncertainty spikes.",

At the time, Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said that the employees had been terminated over \"gross misconduct.\" But now People Make Games has reported that these employees' dismissal didn't have anything to do with spilling secrets from Grand Theft Auto 6 or any other Rockstar projects.\nAccording to People Make Games, the issue at hand arose over internal company messages that were shared on a Discord server used by staff members and representatives of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain. However, the messages shared were about changes to Rockstar's Slack policy, which eliminated channels where workers could chat about topics outside of the office.",
