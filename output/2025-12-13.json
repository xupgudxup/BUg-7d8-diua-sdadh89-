    "description": "Trevor Cone is in line to earn a PGA Tour card at the Final Stage of Q-School.",
    "fullText": "Last fall, the PGA Tour ratified major changes to its membership rules, reducing the total number of PGA Tour cards, as well as the amount awarded to top players on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nWith this week’s Final Stage of PGA Tour Q-School at the halfway point, pro Trevor Cone is in line to earn one of the five PGA Tour cards up for grabs.\n\nBut in comments to Golfweek after his second round Friday, Cone critiqued the Q-School rules regarding PGA Tour cards that could help him return to the big leagues come Sunday.\n\nSurprisingly, Cone argued that no PGA Tour cards should be given out this week.\n\nThe 2026 PGA Tour season will be the first one impacted by the major Tour changes that went into effect this year.\n\nFirst, only 100 full PGA Tour cards will be awarded, sharply down from 125 Tour cards previously.\n\nThe Korn Ferry Tour was arguably hit hardest by that change.\n\nThrough the 2024 season, the top 30 finishers on the season-long Korn Ferry Tour points list would earn PGA Tour cards. But under the new rules, only the top 20 finishers on the Korn Ferry Tour received Tour cards for the 2026 season, a reduction of 33%.\n\nThere were direct, though less dramatic, impacts for Q-School. Previously, the top-5 finishers and ties at the Final Stage of Q-School would get their Tour cards of the next season. Beginning this year, only the top 5, not including ties, graduate to the PGA Tour.\n\nAnd Cone, the 36-hole co-leader at this week’s Final Stage of Q-School, know this all too well.\n\nThe intense struggle to earn a PGA Tour card is very familiar to Cone. This is not his first go-round.\n\nHe initially earned full Tour status for the 2022-23 season, but finished 162nd in the FedEx Cup to lose his Tour card for 2024. But Cone was undaunted. He went back to the Korn Ferry Tour in 2024 and played well enough to finish 27th in the year-end standings.\n\nAs previously noted, the 2024 season was the last in which the top 30 Korn Ferry Tour finishers earned PGA Tour cards. Now the number is 20. Had the rules been put in place one year earlier, Cone would not have earned his 2025 PGA Tour card.\n\nUnfortunately for Cone, his second stint on the PGA Tour did not go well. He missed 15 cuts to finish 178th in the FedEx Cup standings, thereby losing all PGA Tour status again.\n\nHis final opportunity to make it back to the PGA Tour is at Q-School, and so far he’s made it count. He followed up an opening-round 68 at the Dye Valley Course with a five-under 65. That put him in a five-way tie for the lead with 36 holes to play. In other words, as of now he’s in position to earn his PGA Tour card for the third time.\n\nBut if it was up to him, he wouldn’t be awarded a PGA Tour card this week. That’s what he explained to Golfweek’s Adam Schupak Friday evening.\n\n\"As much as it pains me to say it considering the position I'm in this week,” Cone told Golfweek, “I think if you went back to 25 [PGA Tour cards awarded on the Korn Ferry Tour] and made this tournament strictly for Korn Ferry status, that would be a better option in my mind.”\n\nIn other words, Cone is arguing that a fairer system would have the top-25 finishers in the Korn Ferry Tour earn PGA Tour cards, rather than 20 under the new rules. As a result, Q-School would not award any Tour cards and instead would only give out status for the next Korn Ferry Tour season.\n\n“I think there should only be cards for Korn Ferry Tour status,” he said, reiterating his point.\n\nInterestingly, Cone is speaking from a place of authority. He was a member of the PGA Tour Player Advisory Council during the 2025 season, one year after the new rules were determined.\n\nYou can read all of Cone’s comments to Schupak in his Golfweek report here.\n\nThe post Q-School leader critiques PGA Tour card rules that could benefit him appeared first on Golf.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMohamed Salah is one of Liverpool's greatest modern players and a true Premier League hall-of-famer.\n\nThe Egypt star's assist for Hugo Ekitike in a 2-0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion on December 13 took him to 280 goal involvements in England's top division.\n\nThat puts him third in the all-time standings, behind only Wayne Rooney (311) and Alan Shearer (324).\n\nMohamed Salah now has the third-most goal involvements in Premier League history 🤩 pic.twitter.com/1uKd5Jm5Xz\n\n— Premier League (@premierleague) December 13, 2025\n\nBut it could be 280 and out for Salah. An explosive interview given earlier in December 2025 saw him omitted from the next Liverpool matchday squad and prompted intense speculation that his appearance against Brighton could now be his last in the red shirt.\n\nThe Sporting News looks at what Salah said, and why it caused such a storm.\n\nMORE:Where Salah ranks among all-time Liverpool goal-scorers\n\nSalah criticised Liverpool and manager Arne Slot in a post-match interview after his team drew 3-3 with Leeds United on December 6.\n\nIt was the third straight game that the forward had started on the bench, and the second of those in which he did not see any time on the pitch.\n\nSalah chose to speak to the assembled media at Elland Road as he felt the need to air his frustrations. He claimed he was being scapegoated for Liverpool's poor run of form, accused \"someone\" of wanting to force him out of the club, and said his relationship with Slot had become non-existent.\n\nBelow is the full exchange from an extraordinary interview.\n\nQ: What were you thinking sat on the bench?\n\n\"I don't know what to say. It's funny, but I couldn't believe it. It is a really disappointing result for us as a team because we expect to win a game like that. We managed to score two goals in the beginning and the game was going in our direction, but we conceded silly goals. I'm not attacking my teammates because I was on the bench, but we conceded silly goals, as we did before. We just have to try to keep a clean sheet and win games.\"\n\nQ: What couldn't you believe? \"That I'm sitting on the bench for 90 minutes. The third time on the bench [in a row], I think for the first time in my career. I'm very, very disappointed, to be fair. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season. Now I'm sitting on the bench and I don't know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That's how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.\n\nMORE:Latest updates on Salah's future amid Saudi Arabia interest\n\n\"I got a lot of promises in the summer and so far I am in the bench for three games, so I can't say they keep the promise. I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship. I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club.\n\n\"This club, I always support it. My kids will always support it. I love the club so much. I will always do. I called my mum yesterday — you guys didn't know if I would start or not, but I knew. Yesterday, I said to them [my family]: 'Come to the Brighton game. I don't know if I am going to play or not, but I am going to enjoy it.' In my head, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now.\n\n\"I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to Africa Cup of Nations. I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.\"\n\nQ: What do you do with the situation now? \"It is not acceptable for me. I don't know why this is happening to me. I don't get it. I think if this was somewhere else, every club would protect its player. How I see it now is like, you throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now. But I don't think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club. The respect, I want to get. I don't have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone, but I earned my position. It's football. It is what it is.\"\n\nQ: Have you played your last game for Liverpool? \"In football, you never know. I don't accept this situation. I have done so much for this club.\"\n\nQ: How frustrated are you? \"With respect, I love everyone. I love [Erling] Haaland, I will talk about him. I am the current top goal-scorer in the Premier League [from last season]. He is not yet. He is going to win it hopefully, and that is fine for him. I love him and he knows that. I am top goal-scorer, best player, winning the league in such a style, but I am the one who has to defend himself in front of the media and fans.\"\n\nQ: Does this hurt you more? \"Absolutely. After what I have done for the club, it really hurts. You can imagine, really. After going from home to the club, and you don't know if you are starting. I know the club too well; I have been here many years. Tomorrow, [Jamie] Carragher is going to go for me again and again, and that's fine.\"\n\nI’m not sure I’ve wanted Liverpool to win a game more than tonight for a long time!\nCome you mighty 🔴🤞 https://t.co/V0vhBwFW2i\n\n— Jamie Carragher (@Carra23) December 9, 2025\n\nQuestion on Saudi Arabia transfer interest: \"I don't want to answer this question, because the club is going to take me to a different direction.\"\n\nQ: Is the situation impossible now to solve? \"I cannot say it is impossible, but from what I feel, I have done so much for the club, I love the fans and the club so much, but I don't know what is going to happen next.\"\n\nQ: Is it doubly frustrating that you didn't even come on? \"I have been at this club, scoring more than anyone in this generation, since I came to the Premier League, I don't think anyone has scored more goals and made more assists than me. In the whole Premier League. If I am somewhere else, everybody would go to the media and defend the players. I am the only one in this situation. I remember a while ago, Harry Kane was not scoring for 10 games, [and] everyone in the media was like, 'Oh, Harry will score for sure'. When it comes to Mo, everyone is like, 'He needs to be on the bench'. I am sorry, Harry.\"\n\nMo Salah now has more Premier League goal involvements for Liverpool than any other player has for a single team in the league's history, passing Wayne Rooney's record with Man Utd 🌟 pic.twitter.com/a5CgEFye5D\n\n— BBC Sport (@BBCSport) December 13, 2025\n\nQ: When you say about someone wanting you out, who? \"I don't know. I don't know. I really don't know.\"\n\nQ: The sporting director? \"No, no, don't put the words in my mouth. From the situation I see that's it.\"\n\nQ: Had anyone sort of communicated and explained the situation to you? Have you actually asked for that? \"I did. I did, but I don't see an explanation. Like I knew yesterday that I was not going to play and that's it, so [I] take it and swallow it and go home.\"\n\nQ: Were you told personally you weren't going to be playing by Arne? \"Yeah, he told me yesterday and [I] had a meeting with him.\"\n\nQ: Did you let your feelings be known then, you were disappointed? \"He knows my feeling. He knows my feeling.\"\n\nQ: Do you regret signing that contract [in April 2025]? \"Imagine how bad that I have to answer it, honestly. That hurts, even the question hurts. This club, signing for this club, I will never regret it. I thought I'm going to renew here and end my career here, but this is not according to the plan, so I'm not regretting signing for the club for sure.\"\n\nQ: You're one of the greatest players in Liverpool's history. Can you believe it might end like this? \"Somehow it will end, but the thing in my head is like, why it should end this way? Because I am too fit. Just five months ago I was just winning every individual award, so why should it go this direction I'm sorry everybody in a team is not in his form, yet I'm the one who has to defend himself now.\"\n\nQ: Is now the next step for you to [speak with] Arne again? \"No, I don't think so. We spoke a lot.\"\n\nQ: Has the relationship broken down? \"Yeah, there's no relationship between us. It was [a] very good relationship and now all of a sudden there is no relationship.\"\n\nQ: Has something changed behind the scenes? \"You guys know better than me. I don't know.\"\n\nQ: Do you feel let down from teammates as well? \"No, no, no. These guys, they know how much I love them. They know how much I support them, even inside before the game, after the game. I'm an experienced player; I've been in their position. I always support them, I always give them experience. But no, no, the players, they're not connected to the situation. Even they support me so much, so there's just much love between us as players and respect.\"\n\nA smiling Mo Salah turns down interview requests as he walks through the mixed zone.\n“Two weeks in a row?

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Browns roster has undergone a ton of changes over the last week, with even more coming on Saturday before Week 15’s matchup with the Chicago Bears. On Tuesday, the Browns made six moves, including placing OL Ethan Pocic and RB Jerome Ford on injured reserve. On Wednesday, six more moves happened, including bringing back DT Maurice Hurst II.\n\nThursday dropped down to just one roster move for Cleveland, but Friday’s injury report had seven players listed as out and another five listed as questionable versus the Bears.\n\nSaturday continued the roster shuffling with WR Jamari Thrash waived and OL Zak Zinter ruled out for the game.\n\nThrash was a fifth round pick in the 2024 NFL draft. He was seen by many as a steal at that point in the draft and ESPN labeled him as a player to watch in training camp this year. Thrash has played in just 18 games with just 13 receptions for 129 yards in his two seasons with the Browns.\n\nZinter has played in 19 games after being Cleveland’s third round pick last year. The Michigan alum has been mostly inactive this season. Due to injuries, Zinter was in line to start this week before being ruled out. With just three starts and 239 snaps on offense, the future is uncertain for the Browns Day 2 pick from 2024.\n\nIn a corresponding move to Thrash’s departure, Cleveland signed OL Garrett Dellinger to the active roster. The Browns also elevated S Christopher Edmonds and Hurst for this week.\n\nHow surprised are you by Thrash’s career with the Browns? Does Zinter’s injury create even more questions about his future with the team?\n\nShare your thoughts in the comment section below",

    "description": "MLB free agency 2025-26 hasn’t been quite as active as everyone hoped, with many of the top MLB free agents […]",
    "fullText": "MLB free agency 2025-26 hasn’t been quite as active as everyone hoped, with many of the top MLB free agents still available as Christmas Day nears. There’s still plenty of time for big signings to happen, meaning teams that have fallen short of expectations in the open market could still turn things around.\n\nMore than a month into MLB free agency, we’re highlighting some of the winners and losers so far.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays responded to a heartbreaking loss in Game 7 of the World Series by splurging early in MLB free agency. Dylan Cease got a hefty contract, but Toronto is rightfully betting on a co-ace who finished in the 95th percentile for Whiff rate last season and in the 89th percentile for strikeout rate. To support the back of the rotation, the club brought in Cody Ponce after he turned his career around overseas. Most recently, the Blue Jays bullpen got better with the addition of Tyler Rogers (2.38 ERA over 147.2 IP in last two seasons). Best of all, there’s still a very real chance of Bo Bichette being re-signed and a potential Kyle Tucker signing.\n\nBuster Posey isn’t at fault for what’s happening with the San Francisco Giants right now. The problem is ownership. It started in March when a 10% stake in the franchise was sold to the private equity firm Sixth Street. Things don’t get better when private equity is brought in; reducing costs to increase revenue is the goal. Suddenly this offseason, the Giants reportedly aren’t interested in spending $100 million-plus on a starting pitcher. Sixth Street might not like to hear this, but that’s the going rate for quality starters in the open market. There’s no reason to expect San Francisco to start splurging later this winter.\n\nThe back-to-back World Series champions had a glaring need to address this offseason, and they took care of it quickly. Over the last three seasons, the All-Star closer ranks 11th among qualified relievers in ERA (2.48), sixth in batting average allowed ($0.173$) and third in strikeout rate (38.4%). Los Angeles needed a shutdown closer; Diaz provides it. Equally as valuable to Los Angeles, Diaz took a short-term deal (three years, $69 million) so the Dodgers are still positioning themselves for long-term flexibility if a salary cap is implemented.\n\nWe could give credit to the Pittsburgh Pirates for being aggressive early in MLB free agency and making a genuine effort to sign Kyle Schwarber. Here’s the problem: Pittsburgh is striking out on all the top MLB free agents. Why? Because Pirates owner Bob Nutting has put this franchise in such a disastrous and poorly-run state that top talent wants nothing to do with the club. So, with an MLB salary floor likely incoming, Pittsburgh will have to vastly overspend on mid-tier free agents and overpay for marginal talent just to meet the cap floor. This is what happens when an owner spends years fielding an awful team and investing as little as he can into the on-field product.\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles are finally spending serious money in MLB free agency. Yes, the Pete Alonso contract (five years, $155 million) is a significant commitment to a 31-year-old who can barely play first base. However, it was also a desperately needed addition since the Orioles lineup finished 19th in slugging and 21st in OPS last season. Plus, this signing positions Baltimore to flip either Ryan Mountcastle or Coby Mayo for a starting pitcher. We’ve been waiting years for the Orioles to spend, and they finally did it; credit is due.\n\nIn the span of just a few weeks, the New York Mets moved on from Brandon Nimmo, Pete Alonso and Edwin Diaz. We can justify in some regard the decision to not re-sign Alonso, but giving Jorge Polanco $20 million per year is a massive risk given his knee issues. New York certainly improved defensively by bringing in Marcus Semien, but he’s coming off a two-year stretch at the plate with a .234/.307/.379 triple-slash line and a .686 OPS. So, if his fielding dips considerably in his age 35 season, he’s a complete negative for New York. Oh, we’re also still waiting on the Mets rotation to be addressed.",

    "description": "Our Memphis vs. Louisville predictions expect the Tigers to cover on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "The No. 11-ranked Louisville Cardinals host the Memphis Tigers in college basketball action on Saturday.\n\nThe Cardinals are an offensive powerhouse and sit as 15.5-point favorites, but my Memphis vs. Louisville predictions think the spread is a tad too wide.\n\nSee why with my college basketball picks for this non-conference clash on December 13.\n\nMemphis vs Louisville best bet: Memphis +15.5 (-105)\n\nThe Louisville Cardinals entered this season with national title aspirations and have rolled to an 8-1 record. After losing their first game of the season at No. 17 Arkansas last week, they bounced back with an 87-78 win against Indiana.\n\nThe Cardinals launch threes at the highest rate in the nation and knock them down at a 36% clip. They're also highly efficient inside the arc and sit in the Top 50 in turnover rate. That said, their stock is at a sell-high point making this line a tad too wide.\n\nThe Memphis Tigers got off to a poor start this season, losing four of their first five games. However, they've gone 7-1 against the spread this season and are trending in the right direction. They're now on a three-game win streak and are fresh off a 78-71 win against Baylor.\n\nFormer five-star recruit Aaron Bradshaw had averaged just 10.8 minutes per game through his first contests with his new school. However, the center has logged 15.5 points in 21.0 minutes per game over his last two contests.\n\nMeanwhile, Louisville's five-star guard Mikel Brown has struggled with his shot after a great start to his college career. The freshman is shooting just 30.8% from the field and 19.5% from the arc over his last five games.\n\nWhen the Tigers faced Purdue (then the No. 1 team in the country) in Nassau three weeks ago, they were 14.5-point underdogs. They were neck-and-neck until the five minutes before the Boilermakers pulled away for a nine-point win.\n\nExpect the Tigers to keep things within a big number against a highly-ranked opponent again.\n\nWhile I'm betting on Memphis to cover this big spread, I still think Louisville is the far better team and will get the win at home.\n\nIf the Tigers want to cover this spread, they need to make sure Louisville doesn't go ballistic from deep. Brown has knocked down fewer than 2.5 threes in four of his last five games.\n\nThe Cardinals have been elite on offense but aren't as good on the other end of the floor. That combined with their blazing-fast pace can lead to inflated offensive numbers for their opponents.\n\nThat's good news for Memphis point guard Dug McDaniel who has dropped more than 5.5 dimes in six of eight games this season.\n\nLouisville center Sananda Fru has grabbed fewer than 7.5 boards in seven of his last eight games.\n\nSpread: Memphis +15.5 (-105) | Louisville -15.5 (-115)\n\nMoneyline: Memphis +950 | Louisville -1700\n\nOver/Under: Over 160.5 | Under 160.5\n\nThe Tigers are 7-1 ATS this season.

    "fullText": "Arne Slot said there was \"no issue to resolve\" after bringing Mohamed Salah on as a substitute in Liverpool's 2-0 win against Brighton on Saturday -- a week after the forward's explosive comments about the club.\n\nHugo Ekitike scored at Anfield after 46 seconds and Salah, introduced in the 26th minute, set up the Frenchman for a second goal with half an hour to go.\n\nSalah accused Liverpool of throwing him \"under the bus\" after he was left on the bench for last week's 3-3 draw at Leeds -- the third match in a row that he did not start.\n\nHe also said that he had no relationship with Liverpool manager Slot when he spoke to reporters after the match at Elland Road.\n\nHe was omitted from the midweek Champions League trip to Inter Milan, which Liverpool won 1-0, and he was the subject of intense scrutiny in the build-up to Saturday's game at Anfield.\n\nSlot said at Friday's pre-match press conference that he would speak to the forward later in the day, adding: \"I have no reasons (for) not wanting him to stay.\"\n\nSpeaking after the win against Brighton, Slot said that there was \"no issue to resolve\" with Salah, whose corner was headed home by Ekitike in the 60th minute.\n\n\"For me he's now the same as any other player,\" he said. \"You talk to your players if you're happy or unhappy with things, but there's nothing for me to talk about after what happened against Leeds, after the game.\"\n\nSlot confirmed that Salah was left out of the squad for the fixture in Italy due to his interview.\n\n\"Every manager makes different decisions... but he wasn't involved in the game against (Inter) Milan and I spoke to him yesterday,\" he said.\n\n\"I think, as I usually never say anything about (what) we talk about, I'm not going to make an exception now, but I think actions speak louder than what has been said.\n\n\"He was in the squad again and when I had to make my first substitutions, I brought him in. And he performed as I think every fan, including me, would like him to perform today.\"\n\nSalah, 33, who signed a new two-year contract at Liverpool in April, will now depart for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).\n\nThe length of his absence depends on how far Egypt go in the competition in Morocco, with the final on January 18.\n\nThe forward, who has been linked with a move to the wealthy Saudi Pro League, had invited his family to the Brighton game as speculation swirled over his future.\n\nSlot laughed off a question about whether the match could have been Salah's last for the club.\n\n\"He wasn't the only player who walked around the pitch thanking the fans, because the fans deserved a thank you from us,\" he said.\n\nThe Dutchman added: \"Mo is going to go to the AFCON now, I hope he's going to do very well, and in the meantime we have to play here without him, with not that many players available at the moment.\"",

    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia 76ers were able to defeat the Indiana Pacers 115-105 on Friday, which is the most important thing, but the Sixers also saw their star tandem play well together on the floor.\n\nEmbiid went for 39 points and nine rebounds as he scored his most points in a game since dropping 70 on the San Antonio Spurs in January of 2024. Meanwhile, George had 23 points, knocked down four triples on seven attempts, and had six rebounds and five assists. This is the type of performance the Sixers envisioned with the two on the floor.\n\nCoach Nick Nurse still had to work through some minutes restrictions, so the pairing couldn't play too much together, but Nurse and the Sixers saw a glimpse of what could be.\n\n\"It was good,\" Nurse started. \"I think all of it, I don’t wanna get too carried away here, but it was all good. I thought they looked good together. There was a long stretch of the game when I was trying to separate them just, again, because of the minutes kinda restrictions. So, I was trying to alternate them. I think it all worked really well.\"\n\nThis is still a work in progress, but the Sixers were able to see what they have in lineups with both Embiid and George, as well as having one of them off the floor in this setting. Philadelphia is still working its way through the ups and downs of the season, but the Embiid-George performance against the Pacers does offer some hope.\n\nWith Embiid and George on the floor in the fourth quarter, they spearheaded a defensive effort that left the Pacers frustrated. It was an impressive performance and it's one the Sixers will look to build on as they move forward into the season.\n\n\"I think the times when Paul was out, Joel carried, and when Joel was out, Paul did his thing. So, I think—and then the combination of them at the end, it’s tough,\" Nurse finished. \"I think they had a stretch where they scored eight in a row. We’re more worried about how we’re gonna get to the end of the game and the game’s getting pretty tough right in the moment, right? Again, I think the combination was good and I think the solo when they were on solo was good.\"\n\nThe Sixers will face the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday on the road looking to bounce back from their double overtime loss to the Hawks at home back on Nov. 30.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Nick Nurse evaluates Joel Embiid, Paul George minutes vs. Pacers",

    "description": "Salah came off the bench to help Liverpool beat Brighton in his final club game before joining up with Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations",
    "fullText": "Arne Slot has insisted he has “no issue to resolve” now with Mohamed Salah after bringing him back into the Liverpool team following his explosive interview at Leeds.\n\nSalah came off the bench to get an assist in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Brighton, seven days after he had said he had no relationship with Slot, claiming he had been thrown under the bus as the club had made him a scapegoat and broken promises to him.\n\nSlot was part of the decision to omit him from the squad who he took to Italy for Tuesday’s 2-0 win over Inter Milan in the Champions League but held talks with Salah on Friday, when he determined the forward was available for selection again.\n\nAnd now he argued their problems are in the past and that he will treat Salah the same as anyone else in his squad.\n\nHe said: “For me, there is no issue to resolve. For me, he is now the same as any other player. You talk to your players if you are happy or unhappy with things. There is nothing for me to talk about after what happened against Leeds after the game.”\n\nSlot accepted that others might have exiled Salah from the team for longer but praised the Egyptian for his display against Brighton on his return.\n\nHe added: “The reason he wasn’t in Milan was his interview and the question after that - and everybody has a different opinion - is should he be once, twice, three times, four times, four months or 12 years [out of the squad]? Every manager makes different decisions on that.\n\n“I spoke to him the day before the game. I usually never say anything about what we talk about, I am not going to make an exception now but I think actions speak louder than what has been said and he was in the squad again and when I had to make my first substitution, I brought him in and he performed as every fan, including me, would like him to today.\n\n\"It was an easy decision to put him in the squad. I think he is a Liverpool player and the moment he is there I like to use him when we need him. When he came in, he had the performance like you would want him to give. He was a threat and that is very important. He was constantly involved. That was pleasing but not a surprise to see.”",

    "fullText": "Undefeated UFC welterweight fighter Shavkat Rakhmonov has already caught wind of Joaquin Buckley’s most recent callout and “Nomad” is not interested in wasting his time on the “big mouth” contender.\n\nOn Friday, Buckley took to social media to release a callout video targeting Rakhmonov. This stems from some back-and-forth earlier in the week. This time around, Buckley pulled no punches, stating that he’d “f—k up” Rakhmonov in a potential clash. Buckley also said he’d be willing to fight anyone at 170 pounds that would get him to a matchup with Shavkat.\n\nSounds like “New Mansa” really doesn’t like his welterweight counterpart.\n\nRakhmonov, 31, has been sidelined since a decision win over Ian Machado Garry at UFC 310 just over one year ago. The undefeated contender is expected to make his return in early 2026, but nothing has been made official. While Rakhmonov was on the cusp of his first-ever UFC title shot after his last appearance an extended absence from competition could impact his title fight chances in 2026.\n\nEarly Saturday, Rakhmonov responded to Buckley yet again. “Nomad” labeled Buckley “delusional” and stated that he’d rather fight Kamaru Usman than spend any time worrying about “New Mansa.”\n\nYou are delusional. I’d rather fight the guy who just whooped you than waste time on you kid. You can be my third option big mouth https://t.co/deFGmNVztn\n\n— Shavkat “Nomad” Rakhmonov (@Rakhmonov1994) December 13, 2025\n\n“You are delusional,” wrote Rakhmonov. “I’d rather fight the guy who just whooped you than waste time on you kid.

    "description": "WWE star Becky Lynch believes all pro wrestlers likely have at least one specific thing in common with each other.",
    "fullText": "As a worldwide phenomenon, professional wrestling has long attracted performers with diverse backgrounds. In the case of Becky Lynch, her roots were initially anchored in Ireland, but later expanded to countries such as Canada, Japan, and the United States. Whatever one's history may be, though, Lynch believes all wrestlers likely have at least one specific thing in common.\n\n\"I was just going [to training] so that I would be less of a delinquent,' Lynch recalled on \"First We Feast.\" \"[It was just] to organize my life and get my act together, and it did. I started doing better at school. I started training. It changed everything. It changed everything in my life, but it wasn't for the goal of becoming a professional wrestler. I found a community that I loved. I found that if I worked hard at something, I could get better at it. And I was never good at anything. There's something about wrestlers, maybe there's like a little screw loose, I don't know, but there is something that bonds us all together.\n\n\"You meet so many different people from different walks of life,\" she continued. \"We were all like co-mingling and having a great time and having the banter and having the crack and having the fun. Crack means fun; we weren't doing drugs.\"\n\nAccording to Lynch, her connection to wrestling extends back to early childhood, when she and her brother watched it together on television. After they took a break from it, the siblings returned to wrestling during WWE's Attitude Era, with Lynch especially drawn to the passionate promos of Mick Foley. Overall, she says it was the storytelling that won her over, more so than the physical action.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"First We Feast\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "FC Bayern will square off vs. Mainz 05 in the Bundesliga…",
    "fullText": "Bayern Munich head coach Vincent Kompany thinks Mainz is better than its last place standing in the Bundesliga and the Belgian is not going to take Sunday’s match lightly — especially as the Carnival Club has a new boss, Urs Fischer.\n\n“Of course, there are always a few question marks when a new coach arrives. You always expect a reaction from the team. I have to say, we are always prepared – including for the fact that systems sometimes change during the game. Other teams have a normal tactic and a ‘Bayern plan’. It’s happened before that we were so well prepared, but the opponent did something different because they were playing against us,” Kompany said (as captured by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nMost of Kompany’s press conference was spent dealing with personnel inquiries, When asked about Jonas Urbig starting one of the next two matches, Kompany explained how the decision-making process works.\n\n“We have two things in mind regarding Manuel Neuer: Firstly, his freshness and match rhythm, and we mustn’t forget that it’s sometimes good for him to get a bit of rest. Secondly, we’re keeping Jonas Urbig’s development in mind. When Jonas plays again at some point, we’ll discuss it with Manu and Jonas first. At the moment, we’re operating normally. Manu is fit and has performed well. Therefore, we won’t open this topic right now,” Kompany said.\n\nFinally, Kompany was asked about the progress of Alphonso Davies and Jamal Musiala.\n\n“All is going to plan (for Davies). As I said before, everything before the end of the year is a bonus for him. If he gets minutes against Mainz and Heidenheim then that’s a bonus – and then from January he will be fully competitive,” Kompany noted. “Jamal is close. Hopefully next week he gets a few training sessions with us before Christmas. That would be a nice feeling for him and for us. There’s absolutely no pressure on him or the medical staff. From January, I think he’ll get his first minutes.”\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "description": "A Los Angeles Lakers writer believes the franchise should consider moving on from a nine-year veteran.",
    "fullText": "Lakers predicted to cut ties with Luka Doncic's former $33 million Mavericks teammate originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt’s safe to say the Los Angeles Lakers will look a bit different by the time the Feb. 5 trade deadline passes.\n\nThe franchise has plenty of tradable assets it can use in a midseason deal to upgrade its roster. Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk is under the impression that Luka Doncic’s 6-foot-10 former Dallas Mavericks teammate is among the assets the Lakers will move on from this season.\n\n“The Golden State Warriors proved last season why it can be advantageous to make a move early,” Rovenchuk wrote Friday. “They acquired Dennis Schroder, gave the experiment a shot, and rerouted him in favor of eventually securing Jimmy Butler when the initial venture failed.”\n\n“If the Lakers were going to replicate a similar approach, there is one clear member of the roster who stands out as a part of the outgoing package for Los Angeles. That would be Maxi Kleber.”\n\n“Kleber has been sidelined recently, dealing with a lower back injury. With the Lakers struggling to find defense, athleticism, shooting, and bench scoring, any one of these needs could have him moved before even being given the opportunity to return to the court for Los Angeles.”\n\nWhile it may not be easy to believe, Kleber was once a valuable stretch four who played respectable pick-and-pop basketball alongside Doncic in Los Angeles.\n\nFast forward to the 2025-26 season, and Kleber, who was included in the blockbuster Feb. 2 trade that landed Doncic with the Lakers, is a low-impact contributor for JJ Redick’s crew.\n\nWhile Kleber is shooting 37.5% from three, he’s contributing just 1.8 points and 1.8 rebounds per game in 12.1 minutes, signaling that it may be time to part ways with the 33-year-old big man.\n\nIf one thing’s certain, Kleber is running out of time to prove himself in Los Angeles.\n\nMore NBA: Spurs' Stephon Castle makes basketball history never done ever before in NBA",

    "title": "Chiefs-Chargers: 5 things to watch in Week 15 contest",
    "description": "Here are the key factors in the pivotal matchup between Kansas City and Los Angeles.",
    "fullText": "On Sunday, the (6-7) Kansas City Chiefs will take on the division rival (9-4) Los Angeles Chargers in an AFC West showdown on Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. The game will kick off at noon Arrowhead Time and will be broadcast on CBS — locally on KCTV5.\n\nThis game will be a rematch of the season opener, in which the Chargers won 27-21 in São Paulo, Brazil. Los Angeles has put together a strong season since, and is currently the top Wild Card team in the AFC playoff race. The Chiefs are on the outside looking in, and this season has been a major disappointment for the defending conference champions.\n\nTemperatures at kickoff are expected to be frigid. Since 2010, the Chiefs are 5-3 against the Chargers in December at Arrowhead.\n\nLast week, left tackle Esa Pole made his NFL debut after Wanya Morris left the game early with a knee injury. Both Morris and right tackle Jawaan Taylor have been declared out for this game, so Pole is slated to start again.\n\nThis is a golden opportunity for the undrafted rookie — who turned in a solid performance in his debut — to continue to make a case for a roster spot in 2026. Morris is slated to be a free agent, while Taylor could be a cap casualty. So if he plays well enough, Pole has a chance to compete for a starting job or a shot at being the team’s new swing tackle.\n\nSimilar to the Houston Texans, Los Angeles has a solid pass rush featuring veteran outside linebacker Khalil Mack and rising star Tuli Tuipulotu off the edge. But unlike the Texans, the Chargers’ pass rush relies on power, which will give Pole a new set of obstacles to overcome. If he turns in another solid performance, it will be worth keeping him on the field through the end of the season.\n\nThird downs will be critical this week. Los Angeles’ offense converts at a 47% rate, the third-highest in the NFL, while the Chiefs rank 13th at 40%. Defensively, the Chargers allow the fourth-lowest percentage of third-down conversions (34%), while Kansas City ranks 26th at 43%.\n\nThe Chiefs’ struggles to defend third down were apparent last week. The defense allowed eight conversions over 18 attempts against Houston — and the week prior, nine of 16 third downs against the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe Chiefs’ issues on third-down defense stem from the inability to create pressure in passing situations. That started in Week 1, when Los Angeles converted seven of 13 third downs.\n\nThe Chargers rank second in the NFL in time of possession per game, averaging 32:56 per game. Los Angeles excels at keeping teams off balance on early downs, while setting up manageable third downs where the powerful run game helps move the sticks.\n\nThis presents a layered problem for Kansas City’s defense that has been one of the least effective units under Chiefs’ defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.\n\nThis could be one of the lower-scoring games in the recent history of this rivalry. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, the Over/Under is listed at only 41.5 points — and the very cold weather expected on Sunday could also be a factor.\n\nBoth teams rank among the top 10 in points allowed per game: Kansas City surrenders 19.4 points per game, while the Chargers allow 20.8 points per contest.\n\nEach franchise ranks in the upper third of the league in points scored per game, but both have serious offensive line issues that could hinder the strategy. The Chiefs’ game plan in Week 14 was boosted by a backup-heavy offensive line, and Los Angeles has had its own struggles protecting quarterback Justin Herbert.\n\nTo win this game, Kansas City needs bounce-back performances from its top two pass-catchers after a horrible game in Week 14. Rice caught only four catches for 34 yards, while Kelce had one catch for eight. Both players dropped passes at key times; one resulted in a turnover on downs, and the other ended as an interception.\n\nIt was an embarrassing effort by the two players who directly contributed to the loss. The Chiefs have a higher standard for both.\n\nNeither player spoke to the media after the game; it appeared frustrations from this long season had boiled over. Leadership is desperately needed for this team right now, and it starts at the top. Anything can happen in the NFL, but if the Chiefs want to even imagine making the playoffs, then they need all-out efforts from Kelce and Rice on Sunday.\n\nDue to injuries on the Chargers’ offensive line, Herbert has been one of the most hit and pressured quarterbacks in the NFL this season. He is the third-most sacked quarterback — having taken 45 this year — and has taken the second most hits (61) on the season.\n\nThe beating has taken its toll, and Herbert is playing with a broken left hand, which has limited what the Chargers can do offensively. The Chiefs’ pass rush has struggled to generate pressure this season, but getting after Herbert will be a key to Sunday’s game.",

    "description": "Here are three Brooklyn Nets takeaways from Friday's 119-111 loss to Anthony Davis and the Dallas Mavericks.",
    "fullText": "The Brooklyn Nets (6-18) went into the mini-break due to the NBA Cup having won three of his last four games so they came into Friday's game against the Dallas Mavericks (10-16) feeling good about themselves. Brooklyn also was able to get healthier over the course of their break, but it wasn't enough for them to get a win in Dallas against Anthony Davis and company.\n\nThe Nets lost to the Mavericks 119-111 despite the fact that forward Michael Porter Jr. continued his excellent play that could potentially get him into the All-Star Game. Porter had 34 points and four rebounds while rookie forward Danny Wolf had 17 points and seven rebounds coming off the bench for a Brooklyn team that needed someone to step up.\n\nMavericks center Anthony Davis has mostly kept in check through the first three quarters, but he turned his game up a notch in the fourth quarter, finishing with 24 points, 14 rebounds, and three blocks. Rookie forward Cooper Flagg didn't disappoint either as he had 22 points and eight assists of his own. Here are three Nets takeaways from Friday's loss at the Mavericks:\n\nIt's no secret that Porter has been playing like one of the best players in the Eastern Conference, regardless of the fact that the Nets will probably be one of the worst teams in the league when this season is over. However, it will be interesting to see if he can continue playing this well as the Nets schedule gets harder prior to the All-Star break.\n\nWolf has arguably been playing like the best rookie on the team ever since he entered the rotation towards the end of November. With the Nets looking for players to step up alongside Porter and center Nic Claxton, Wolf has been there to do whatever the team needs him to do.\n\nAfter starting the season like one of the players that could have a bigger impact, Mann has settled into the role of being a defender and a facilitator as opposed to being a scorer. Mann finished Friday's loss to the Mavericks with a good, all-around game with 12 points, four rebounds, seven assists, and two steals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nets Wire: 3 Nets takeaways from 119-111 loss at Anthony Davis, Mavericks",

No. I am the Castilla coach and focused on that. On my players, on the upcoming matches, on the training. There is nothing else outside this framework. Xabi Alonso is an exceptional coach.”",

They’re hoping to bring back their second state title in that span while ending a miracle playoff run for Ouachita Parish in Saturday afternoon’s Division I Non-Select championship game.\n\nLIVE STREAM:Watch Ruston vs. Ouachita Parish live on the NFHS Network ()\n\nThe Bearcats have played in the last three Division I Non-Select title contests, winning the second one in 2023. That was their first championship since 1990, and overall, Ruston has won nine state titles.\n\nSaturday, the Bearcats (11-2) seek title number 10. They came into the playoffs as the top seed, and have done their part. Ruston won all three of its playoff games at home, including a 21-17 decision against Zachary in last week’s semifinal round.\n\nNow, the Bearcats have a rematch with their District 2-5A rival, which has taken a very unconventional route.\n\nOuachita Parish (10-4) started the season 5-0 before dropping four straight games, including a 21-14 decision to Ruston on Oct. 10. The Lions came into the playoffs as the No. 14 seed, but have won three straight postseason games on the road, including a quarterfinal win against No. 3 seed Destrehan and a 14-7 win last week at Neville, the No. 2 seed.\n\nNow, Ouachita Parish is in its first Prep Classic since 1994 and determined to win its first title since the Lions claimed their lone championship in 1989.\n\nFollow The Sporting News correspondent Buck Ringgold (@Bucks_Ballpark) for all of the live updates and scoring from New Orleans.\n\nScroll down for live score and game updates from kickoff to the postgame.

QB Montreal Connor launches a deep pass from his own end zone, and Seneca Battle comes down with a great catch, covering 46 yards to midfield on third-and-long.\n\n- Ruston goes three-and-out and will punt. But a great kick from Joaquin Ramos, which bounces down to Ouachita's 5 with less than three minutes in the period.\n\n- Ouachita faces a fourth down near midfield and goes for it, but a pass attempt falls incomplete. Ruston takes over at the 50, the same spot the Bearcats started on their last drive, which resulted in a TD.\n\n- TOUCHDOWN RUSTON.

    "fullText": "How Victor Wembanyama's calf injury may have cost him $55 million originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBefore he was knocked out for 12 games with a calf injury, San Antonio Spurs star center Victor Wembanyama was the odds-on favorite to win the Defensive Player of the Year Award for the 2025-26 NBA season. He’s leading the league in blocks for a third straight season, and he’s also averaging more rebounds per game than any other player in the league.\n\nWembanyama’s combination of size and athleticism on the defensive side of the ball is completely unique, and his prowess on that end of the floor deserves to be acknowledged with some hardware.\n\nHowever, for the second straight season, Wembanyama could miss out on the DPOY award due to the NBA’s recently-instated 65-game threshold, which requires a player to play in at least 65 games in a season to be considered for major awards or All-NBA teams.\n\nA blood clot limited Wembanyama to just 46 games last season, and he’s in danger of missing the mark again this season after his extended stint on the sideline due to the calf injury. Having already missed 12 games this season, Wembanyama can miss just five more games between now and April in order to remain eligible.\n\nIf he falls short of the 65-game mark, not only would it cost Wembanyama some handsome hardware, but it would also impact him financially in a major way. In fact, it could cost him $55 million.\n\nHere’s the skinny: Wembanyama will be eligible for an extension over the offseason. As it stands, the extension could be a five-year, $271 million deal. But, if Wembanyama is named Defensive Player of the Year (or MVP), or if he’s selected to one of the three All-NBA squads that extension could balloon up to $326 million. The odds of that happening now have decreased dramatically since the Spurs center has already missed 12 games.\n\nSo now, the difference between $326 million and $271 million will be how many more games Wembanyama misses this season. If he misses five or fewer, he should be in position to potentially win DPOY and/or be named to an All-NBA team and land the larger extension. But, if he misses more than five more games, he’ll have to settle for the $271, which is obviously still a staggering amount, but still, no one wants to lose out on $55 million.\n\nBeing available will be the name of the game for the rest of the current campaign for Wembanyama, as he now has a major incentive to miss as few games as possible.",

    "fullText": "Michigan State head coach Pat Fitzgerald is tasked with building his first coaching staff in East Lansing and is making some incredibly important hires for the future of the Spartan football program.\n\nSome people in and around the program would agree that the offensive coordinator hire in East Lansing is the most important hire that Fitzgerald is going to make. In the past decade, the Spartans have been abysmal offensive (with the exceptions of 2017 and 2021). MSU needs to get back to strong offensive performance.\n\nHere at Spartans Wire, we have named five guys that could make sense, and then five more candidates that could be in the mix, but now, there are indications that one guy in particular is standing out.\n\nNick Sheridan, the co-offensive coordinator and QB coach at Alabama, is a name to lookout for in MSU's OC search.\n\nSheridan would be a polarizing hire for Michigan State, as he played his collegiate football as a quarterback at Michigan under Rich Rodriguez, starting as a walk-on before becoming the starting quarterback.\n\nThe son of Bill Sheridan, a longtime defensive assistant at both the NFL and college levels, Nick has followed in his father's footsteps with a coaching career.\n\n2012: Western Kentucky (PGC/QB)\n\n2025–present: Alabama (co-OC/QB)\n\nComing from the Kalen DeBoer tree, Sheridan has gotten some strong offensive mentoring, and runs a fun offense that Spartan fans would enjoy. He has play calling experience at Indiana in 2020 and 2021, as well as Alabama in 2024.\n\nThere is no confirmation that Sheridan is the lead candidate, or set to be hired, but he is a name that Spartan fans should keep their eye on throughout this process.\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "description": "Safari 26.2 is a big release.",
    "fullText": "Safari 26.2 is a big release. Packed with 62 new features, this release aims to make your life as a web developer easier by replacing long-standing frustrations with elegant solutions. You’ll find simpler ways to create common UI patterns with just a few lines of HTML or CSS, and no JavaScript — like auto-growing text fields with CSS field-sizing, and buttons that open/close dialogs and popovers with command and commandfor HTML attributes. Navigation API makes building single-page apps more straightforward. Full width numbers are normalized, and text shaping across element boxes is supported for languages like Arabic. Anchor Positioning expands with the position-visibility property and much more. The cursor property works on pseudo-elements. Improvements to Initial Letter make it easier to create drop-caps. CHIPS brings back opt-in partitioned cookies. WebXR on visionOS now supports WebGPU. And much, much more. Plus, this release resolves 165 bugs. It’s a release that makes the web more dependable, letting you spend less time working around browser inconsistencies and more time accomplishing your goals.\n\nHTML is 35 years old, yet keeps evolving to make web development easier. Recent years have brought many small but powerful HTML innovations that simplify building dynamic user interfaces — letting you solve common use cases with HTML and CSS alone, “paving the cowpaths”, and reducing the need for JavaScript or third-party frameworks. Safari 26.2 delivers several more such features.\n\nBefore, using a button on a web page to trigger a client-side action required JavaScript. Now, you can use command and commandfor attributes in HTML to control popovers and dialogs.\n\nUse the commandfor attribute to tie the button to the id of the element it affects. And use the command attribute to tell the browser which action to take. There are six predefined values for the command attribute. These map to existing JavaScript methods. Fordialogelements: show-modal, close, and request-close. And for any HTML element with thepopover attribute: show-popover, hide-popover, and toggle-popover.\n\nYou can also observe custom commands in JavaScript through events. Custom commands are named using --foobar syntax, and used declaratively in HTML as command=\"--foobar\".\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for auto-expanding the details element. Now, anytime someone uses “Find” in Safari to search the page, if the search result is hidden inside a closed details element, the element will automatically expand to reveal the text. Also, if the user navigates to a URL that contains a Text Fragment and the targeted fragment is inside a closed details, it will automatically expand.\n\nSimilarly, Safari 26.2 adds support for the hidden=until-found attribute. You can apply this to any element in HTML, causing the content to not be rendered as part of the page, until a user searches for it. Then it appears.\n\nThebeforematch event, which fires on an element with hidden=until-found just before it’s revealed by a find-in-page search. This allows you to run JavaScript to prepare the content, update analytics, or perform other actions before the hidden content becomes visible to the user.\n\nTo improve accessibility, off-screen radio buttons now automatically scroll into view when focused. This is especially helpful when users navigate with keyboard shortcuts or screen readers.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for thearia-colindextext andaria-rowindextext attributes, which provide human-readable alternatives to aria-colindex and aria-rowindex.\n\nThe previously-supported options use numeric values to indicate a cell’s position within a table or grid. Now aria-colindextext and aria-rowindextext let you provide more meaningful labels. This is particularly valuable when columns use letters (like A, B, C in a spreadsheet) or when rows represent time periods, categories, or other non-numeric sequences. When both attributes are present, assistive technologies announce the human-readable text instead of the number, giving users better context as they navigate complex tables and grids.\n\nFor <input type=\"number\"> fields, Safari 26.2 converts certain full-width characters into normalized equivalents. Full-width characters are commonly used in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text input. Now full-width digits (０１２３) become standard digits (0123); full-width minus signs (－) become standard minus signs (-); and full-width dots (．) become standard periods (.) This normalization lets users type numbers naturally in their language while ensuring the input works correctly as a number value. Also, disallowed characters are now immediately rejected.\n\nYou might remember that HTML5 was originally intended to provide an outlining algorithm — where a website could use multiple h1 headlines on a page, and the browser would assign levels to each headline based on the overall DOM structure of elements. In practical terms, this idea didn’t work out and it was never widely implemented in browsers. Developers simply use h2, h3, h4, etc to convey levels of headline. To go with the intended original behavior in HTML5, the default UA styling for h1 elements was specified to visually change the headline when it was a child of article, aside, nav, or section — making the font-size and margin smaller and smaller each time it was nested. In Safari 26.2, following a recent HTML standard change, those UA styles are being removed.\n\nWhen viewing web content in a Mac Catalyst app on macOS 26.2, elements with a title attribute will now display the tooltip when a user hovers.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for the field-sizing property. Applying field-sizing: content causes the input and textarea form fields to shrink-wrap their content and grow as more text is entered. This eliminates the need for JavaScript to resize form fields dynamically. You can use min-height, min-width, max-height, and max-width to keep the field within the range you desire.\n\nIn recent years, CSS has gained many powerful mathematical abilities, adding to its maturity as a programming language. Safari 26.2 brings three new functions — random(), sibling-index() and sibling-count().\n\nThe random() function lets you include a randomly generated value from a specified range in your calculations. For example, random(0, 100, 2) will choose an even number between 0 and 100, while random(0turn, 1turn) will be a fraction of a turn — basically, any decimal between 0 and 360 degrees. Learn all about what the CSS random function can do in our article, Rolling the dice with CSS random().\n\nThe sibling-count() function counts up the number of elements that are siblings of the current element, and returns a number, while sibling-index() will tell you which numbered item this one is — the 4th item for example. They make it incredibly easy to do things you’ve probably wished you could do for years.\n\nFor example, today, CSS Grid makes it trivial to proportion space in a layout with fr units — but in the days of float-based responsive layouts, this code would have been incredibly helpful (and still is today):\n\nIt calculates a width for an item by dividing the total width available by the total number of sibling items in the DOM. When there’s four items, the width of each is 25%. When there’s five items, each is 20%.\n\nCSS has had nth-child() for a long time, letting you target a specific numbered item. The sibling-index() function is similar, telling you which number item a particular one is in the order.\n\nThis demo uses random() to generate the random rotation distance and sibling-index() to generate the angle for each of the wheel items.\n\nText shaping across inline boxes\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for text shaping across inline boxes. This is especially impactful for scripts like Arabic, N’Ko and many others where the letters join together and change appearance as text is rendered. The word “مرحبا” in Arabic (which means “hello” or “welcome”) is spelled using these letters: م ر ح ب ا — which then change their shapes and work together to create مرحبا. Before Safari 26.2, such letters would not combine if they were wrapped in separate elements. Of course, it’s not common to wrap an individual letter in the middle of a word with a span or other inline element, but there are good use cases for this — especially, perhaps, when wanting to change the color of the letters in teaching how the writing system works, like this:\n\nThere’s still more work to do in this space to support the full range of different behaviors of the many kinds of text shaping around the world.\n\nInitial letter was originally created by folks at Apple and implemented over a decade ago in Safari 9. It was created behind a -webkit- prefix, as was best practice at that time. Since then, the CSS web standard has matured to handle more complex use-cases. Safari 26.2 updates our implementation, adding support for decimal values in the initial-letter property. This can be especially helpful if you need to make a slight adjustment to better fit your font. Also, support for web fonts was added in March 2024 with Safari 18.4. The -webkit- prefix is still required, but these updates make it very usable in the meantime.\n\nAnchor positioning improvements\n\nSafari 26.2 adds several refinements to Anchor Positioning, which originally shipped in Safari 26.0. First, Safari 26.2 supports for flip-x and flip-y options in position-try-fallback. These keywords allow an anchored element to flip along the x- or y-axis when it would otherwise overflow its container.\n\nThe new position-visibility property lets you control when anchor-positioned elements are visible. For example, use no-overflow to hide an element when it overflows its container. Other values include always, anchors-visible, inherit, initial, revert, revert-layer, and unset.\n\nThe position-try property now works on pseudo-elements like ::before, ::after, and ::backdrop, which were previously unaffected. This means pseudo-elements can be repositioned using fallback strategies just like regular elements.\n\nThere are also many updates to the WebKit implementation of Anchor Positioning, listed in Bug Fixes below.\n\nAfter being the first browser to ship new color spaces to CSS, color-mix(), relative color syntax, and contrast-color(), we’re excited to bring even more improvements in Safari 26.2.\n\nThe color-mix() function blends two color values and returns the result. Previously, developers were required to list a color space as the first argument of the function, like this: color-mix(in srgb, magenta, pink). Since many developers used srgb out of habit, the results were often sub-optimal. Starting with Safari 26.2, you can use color-mix() without listing a color space — and get oklab as the default. You can just say color-mix(magenta, pink)\n\nand you’ll get the same result as if you’d written color-mix(in oklab, magenta, pink). The Oklab color space is an especially good choice when blending colors, since the mathematical model is designed to make adjustments based on how humans perceive color, rather than pure numbers. Learn more about wide-gamut P3 color on the web in this video from WWDC.\n\nSafari 26.2 also adds support for thescrollbar-color property. It takes two values — one for the color of the scrollbar thumb (the part that moves) and the second for the scrollbar track (the background). Note in all browsers, the track background color only has an effect according to how that particular operating system works, and is dependent on how the user has their personal settings for scrollbars configured. Along with scrollbar-width and scrollbar-gutter, the scrollbar-color property completes the set of modern properties for styling scrollbars, making it a good time to stop using the original ::-webkit-scrollbar pseudo elements.\n\nSafari 26.2 also adds display-p3-linear to the predefined set of color spaces available for use, alongside of display-p3, srgb and others.\n\nP3 is still a better color space to use in most cases, but having support for P3 Linear provides an easy way to use linear color math while optimizing performance compared to other options like rec2100-linear.\n\nThe accent-color property allows for the customization of form controls with native appearance, but certain color choices could make text or indicators within the control hard to read. Safari 26.2 fixes these issues in both light and dark mode while maintaining a consistently-displayed color across all form controls. To achieve this, the following behaviors are performed:\n\nFor elements with a light color scheme, if the luminance of the accent color is greater than 0.5, the displayed accent color is clamped back down to 0.5 while preserving the hue.\n\nFor elements with a dark color scheme, if the luminance of the accent color is less than 0.5, the displayed accent color is clamped back down to 0.5 while preserving the hue. If the luminance of the accent color is greater than 0.5, then the following controls adapt in order to remain legible:\n\nIn Safari 26.2, the text-decoration property is a proper shorthand for all four of the longhand properties: text-decoration-line, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style and text-decoration-thickness. This means you can combine separate underline qualities for underlines, overlines and sidelines into one CSS rule like this: text-decoration: green wavy underline 3px. This turned out to be a large project, requiring significant refactoring of decades-old code to untangle the interaction between text-decoration and editing code.\n\nThe text-decoration-line property now supports the new spelling-error and grammar-error values, which let you emulate the respective native error markers. For example, this code will take the browser’s default styling for spelling errors (whatever that might be) and apply it to the span of text:\n\n(If you want to override the browser’s default styling for spelling or grammar errors, you can target it with ::spelling-error or ::grammar-error and apply styling as desired — a feature that shipped in Safari 17.4 and is supported in Chromium browsers.)\n\nFinally, Safari 26.2 provides bug fixes for text decoration. The text-decoration-thickness and text-underline-offset have been fixed to properly work in vertical writing modes. And the default computed value for text-emphasis-style: filled|open has been corrected to be filled|open circle instead of filled|open dot in horizontal typographic modes.\n\nThe @scope rule now correctly handles implicit scoping roots when used with constructed and adopted stylesheets in shadow DOM contexts. Previously, styles defined in constructed stylesheets might not have properly respected the shadow boundary as an implicit scope.\n\nThis improvement ensures that when you create a CSSStyleSheet programmatically and adopt it into a shadow root, any @scope rules without an explicit root will correctly treat the shadow root as the implicit scoping boundary:\n\nThis is particularly important for developers building design systems and component libraries using the Constructable Stylesheets API, which is a common pattern in modern Web Components.\n\nWebKit for Safari 26.2 supports using :host as the scoping root in @scope rules. This allows you to create scoped styles that target the shadow host element, making it easier to write encapsulated component styles.\n\nThis feature enhances the ability to write modular, component-based styles while maintaining proper encapsulation boundaries in Web Components.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for using the :scope pseudo-class when the scoping root matches the :visited pseudo-class. This allows you to create sophisticated scoping patterns that take link visitation state into account.\n\nA new value forfont-family is now available in Safari 26.2, named math. This moves a previously directly-coded stack of fonts intended for use with mathematical expressions from being defining in the UA style sheet for just the <math> element to a new rule that can be called anywhere with font-family: math. Math fonts include specialized data for equation layout — things like stylistic variants for stretching glyphs, proper handling of superscripts and subscripts, brackets that span multiple lines, and double-struck characters.\n\nThe newmath-shift CSS property gives you the ability to create a more tightly compacted rendering of formulas by using math-shift: compact to reduce the vertical shift of superscripts.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for cross-origin() and referrer-policy() CSS URL modifiers. These let you control CORS and referrer behavior directly in CSS when loading resources like images or fonts, without needing HTML attributes or server headers. You can now specify these policies inline with your url() functions for more granular control over resource fetching.\n\nThe cursor property now works on pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after. Previously, you couldn’t change the cursor when hovering over content generated by pseudo-elements — now you can style them just like regular elements, giving you more control over the user experience and visual feedback throughout your interface.\n\nPositioned boxes in scrollable containing blocks can now overflow in the scrollable direction. Previously, positioned elements might be clipped or behave unexpectedly when they extended beyond their scrollable container. This fix ensures that positioned content can properly overflow in the direction the container scrolls, making it easier to create complex layouts with scrollable regions and absolutely or fixed positioned elements.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for the Navigation API. A modern replacement for the History API, it’s designed to give you better control over browser navigation. For years, web developers have relied on the History API (pushState, replaceState, and the popstate event) to build single-page applications, but it had significant limitations — you couldn’t intercept link clicks or form submissions, the popstate event only fired for back-forward navigation, and managing navigation state was cumbersome. The Navigation API solves these problems with a cleaner, more powerful interface.\n\nThe key feature is the navigate event, which fires for all types of navigation — link clicks, form submissions, back-forward buttons, and programmatic changes. You can intercept these navigations and handle them client-side, making it much easier to build SPAs without routing libraries. The API is also promise-based, so you can easily coordinate async operations like data fetching with navigation changes, and it includes built-in state management for each navigation entry. Here’s a simple example of client-side routing:\n\nWith this code, all link clicks and navigation within your site are automatically intercepted and handled client-side, turning your multi-page site into a single-page application with just a few lines of code.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for the scrollend event, which fires once when scrolling definitively completes. Whether triggered by user gestures, keyboard navigation, smooth scrolling, or JavaScript, this event gives you a reliable signal that scrolling has finished. Previously, developers had to debounce the scroll event with timers to detect when scrolling stopped, which was imprecise and required guessing at appropriate delay values.\n\nThe scrollend event is useful for tasks that should only happen after scrolling is done, like lazy-loading content, updating UI based on final scroll position, or saving scroll state. Instead of firing dozens of times during a scroll, you get one clean event when it’s actually over.\n\nThis fires once when scrolling stops, giving you a clean, reliable way to respond to the final scroll position without any timer-based guesswork.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for document.activeViewTransition, which exposes the currently active View Transition. This gives you direct access to the transition object while it’s running, allowing you to check its state, wait for specific phases to complete, or programmatically control the transition. You can use this to coordinate other animations or UI updates with your View Transitions, or to handle cases where you need to know if a transition is already in progress before starting a new one.\n\nWebKit for Safari 26.2 adds support for document.caretPositionFromPoint(). This method is useful whenever you want to convert screen coordinates (x, y) into a text position in the document, giving you character-level precision for sophisticated text interaction (like building text editors, annotation tools, or custom selection interfaces).\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for fractional coordinates in PointerEvent and TouchEvent properties like clientX, clientY, pageX, pageY, offsetX, offsetY, and screenX/screenY. Previously, these values were rounded to whole numbers, but they now include sub-pixel precision as decimal values (like 150.7 instead of 151). This gives you more accurate position data for touch and pointer interactions, which is useful for precise drawing applications, gesture recognition, or smooth animation tracking. Note that MouseEvent coordinates remain whole numbers, so if you’re handling multiple input types, you may see different precision levels depending on the event type.\n\nAs part of Interop 2025, Safari 26.2 continues to improve the interoperability of Pointer and Mouse Events. Early implementations of these events predated any official web standard, leading to inconsistencies across browsers. In 2022, the Interop Project took on Pointer and Mouse Events as an investigation to sort out the complexities and chart a path forward. The official web standard for Pointer Events was first published in November 2024, and WebKit now further aligns with that maturing specification.\n\nSafari 26.2 improves asynchronous URL error handling in Service Workers. Invalid or malformed URLs now properly throw catchable errors in async operations, allowing you to handle URL errors gracefully with try/catch blocks.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support in the Cookie Store API for handling cookieStore.set() calls with an empty string path. Previously, passing an empty string for the path parameter could cause issues or unexpected behavior. Now you can explicitly set a cookie with an empty path string, and the API will handle it correctly, giving you more flexibility in how you manage cookie paths programmatically.\n\nThe CookieStore API originally shipped in Safari 18.4. Now, with Safari 26.2, it enforces stricter validation for special cookie name prefixes to prevent misuse. Cookies with certain prefixes have special security meanings: the __Host- prefix indicates an extra-secure cookie (must be secure, no domain, path must be /), and the __Secure- prefix signals it must be sent over HTTPS only. Cookies with invalid names like __Host-Http- and __Http- are now rejected.\n\nSafari 26.2 removes support for the overflowchanged event, which was never standardized. This event fired when an element’s overflow state changed, but modern alternatives like ResizeObserver offer more robust ways to detect layout changes.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for two tools that measure the performance of web applications, Event Timing API and Largest Contentful Paint.\n\nThe Event Timing API lets you measure how long it takes for your site to respond to user interactions. When someone clicks a button, types in a field, or taps on a link, the API tracks the full timeline — from the initial input through your event handlers and any DOM updates, all the way to when the browser paints the result on screen. This gives you insight into whether your site feels responsive or sluggish to users. The API reports performance entries for interactions that take longer than a certain threshold, so you can identify which specific events are causing delays. It makes measuring “Interaction to Next Paint” (INP) possible.\n\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures how long it takes for the largest visible element to appear in the viewport during page load. This is typically your main image, a hero section, or a large block of text — whatever dominates the initial view. LCP gives you a clear signal about when your page feels loaded to users, even if other resources are still downloading in the background.\n\nWeb Inspector now shows Largest Contentful Paint entries in the Timelines tab, both in the Layout & Rendering timeline and in the events list. This makes it easier to see exactly when your page’s largest visible element rendered, and to correlate that timing with other layout and rendering work happening on the page.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for theoverallProgress property on the Animation interface. It gives you a number between 0 and 1 that represents how far the animation has progressed toward completion. Unlike tracking individual iterations, this tells you the progress across the entire animation — so if you have an animation set to run three times, overallProgress tracks the journey from start to finish across all three iterations.\n\nThe Animation.commitStyles() method now works with completed animations, letting you persist their final state as inline styles. You can run an animation to completion, lock in the result, and remove the animation itself — keeping the visual effect while freeing up resources.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for Math.sumPrecise(), which sums multiple numbers with better floating-point accuracy. Regular addition accumulates rounding errors with each operation — adding 12 numbers means 11 separate additions, each losing a bit of precision. Math.sumPrecise() performs the entire sum as a single operation, eliminating accumulated error.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for Map.prototype.getOrInsert() and WeakMap.prototype.getOrInsert(), letting you retrieve a value or insert a default if the key doesn’t exist — all in one operation. This simplifies the common check-then-set pattern, making code that builds up data structures cleaner and more efficiently.\n\nWebKit for Safari 26.2 adds support for Wasm Memory resizable buffer APIs. They give you more control over how WebAssembly memory is allocated and managed, allowing code in both Wasm and JavaScript to directly access the same memory space for efficient communication.\n\nJS String Builtins now let Wasm modules import string constants without substantial glue code, reducing memory usage for some Wasm applications. They also enable workingh directly with JavaScript strings without calling imported JavaScript functions, avoiding the overhead of Wasm-to-JavaScript calls.\n\nSafari 26.2 also adds two resizable ArrayBuffer methods to WebAssembly to allow conversion between fixed-length and resizable memory buffers. The WebAssembly.Memory.prototype.toResizableBuffer() method converts a WebAssembly memory instance to use a resizable ArrayBuffer, whose maximum size is determined by the memory’s maximum property. The WebAssembly.Memory.prototype.toFixedLengthBuffer() method converts a WebAssembly memory instance to use a fixed-length ArrayBuffer, which is the traditional WebAssembly memory behavior.\n\nBack in September 2025, Safari 26.0 added support for WebAssembly.JSTag to bridge exception handling between JavaScript and WebAssembly. When JavaScript throws an exception into Wasm, the execption is wrapped with a JSTag so WebAssembly can catch and handle it appropriately.\n\nSupport for WebXR first shipped in Safari 18.0 in visionOS 2 in September 2024. It relied on WebGL for rendering 3D graphics. In September 2025, Safari 26.0 added support for WebGPU for use cases outside of WebXR. WebGPU is similar to WebGL in its capabilities, but it’s designed to better match how modern GPUs work, resulting in better performance and more flexibility. Now with Safari 26.2 on visionOS, WebXR supports WebGPU. This means you can build experiences in WebXR with the full power of WebGPU.\n\nSafari 26.2 also adds support for using GPUTexture objects as depth-stencil **** attachments in rendering operations and resolve attachments in WebGPU render passes. Depth-stencil attachments are special textures used during 3D render. Depth tracks how far away each pixel is from the camera, while stencil creates masks and templates that control which pixels get rendered. This change simply updates to the very latest specification now allowing texture in JavaScript anyplace you would have used texture.createView() in the past. Now, both are supported.\n\nSafari 26.2 brings many improvements to SVG. First, the <a> element now supports the type attribute, which lets you specify the MIME type of the linked resource. For instance:\n\nThe repeatEvent in SVG animations is an event that fires each time an SVG animation element repeats its iteration, now supported to better align with the SMIL specification and match other browsers. Safari 26.2 also supports the onbegin event handler property defined in the SVGAnimationElement IDL (Interface Definition Language) that fires when an SVG animation starts.\n\nThe async attribute in SVGScriptElement controls whether a script should be executed asynchronously, matching the behavior of HTMLScriptElement.\n\nSafari 26.2 supports the hreflang attribute on SVGAElement. It specifies the language of the linked resource, matching the functionality of HTMLAnchorElement to improve SVG link handling.\n\nAnd see the list of bug fixes below for the full picture of the improvements to SVG.\n\nSafari 26.2 adds support for the encrypted field to RTCRtpHeaderExtensionParameters. This gives you as a developer more fine-grained control over which metadata is visible to network intermediaries versus what remains private end-to-end. The RTCRtpHeaderExtensionParameters WebRTC API interface describes Real-time Transport Protocol header extensions used in media streams. Additional metadata alongside the already-encrypted media payload, might include audio levels, video orientation, timing information and custom application data.\n\nWebKit for Safari 26.2 removes the non-standard legacy drawImageFromRect. Created in the earliest days of Canvas API, it was originally intended to be an intuitive way to draw a rectangular portion of an image, but it never became part of the official Canvas specification. Instead the standard drawImage() method provides this functionality, supported since Safari 2.\n\nSafari 26.2 ships support for CHIPS (Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State) once again. Originally shipped in Safari 18.4 in March 2025, CHIPS was temporarily removed in Safari 18.5 for further refinement.\n\nBeginning with Intelligent Tracking Prevention 1.0 in 2017, we began unconditionally partitioning cookies. Over the next two year, WebKit’s implementation evolved based on feedback, until in 2019 we stopped partitioning cookies. Based on this experience, CHIPS was designed as a way to give site owners control over whether their cookies are partitioned.\n\nNow, partitioned cookies let third-party content — like embedded chat widgets, payment processors, or SaaS tools in iframes — opt-in to using cookies on a specific site without enabling cross-site tracking. Safari blocks setting and accessing cross-site cookies when partitioning was not requested.\n\nIf siteB.example is embedded in an iframe on siteA.example and sets a partitioned cookie, that cookie is only accessible when siteB.example appears on siteA.example — not on other sites.\n\nTo create a partitioned cookie, add the Partitioned attribute along with SameSite=None and Secure:\n\nSafari partitions cookies by site (not origin), matching other browsers. This means news.siteA.example and mail.siteA.example share the same partition since they’re subdomains of siteA.example.\n\nIf you need access to unpartitioned third-party cookies, continue using the Storage Access API with document.requestStorageAccess().\n\nWebDriver in Safari 26.2 makes it easy to write automated tests that exercise different user scenarios involving the Storage Access API. Using the new Set Storage Access WebDriver command, a test can validate what happens when cross-site storage access is granted or denied (i.e., when calling document.requestStorageAccess()). The Set Permissions WebDriver command has been extended to support the storage-access key. This allows a test to validate website behavior when the user has configured permissions to always accept or reject such storage-access requests.\n\nNow in iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, macOS 26.2, watchOS 26.2 and visionOS 26.2, WebKit supports exporting more types of WebPage content using SwiftUI Transferable APIs — now including .png, .flatRTFD, .rtf, and .utf8PlainText.\n\nSafari 26.2 brings some much-requested APIs for developers of extensions. These enhancements make it easier than ever for you to help your users get started using a Safari Web Extension.\n\nFirst, from your native iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS application, it’s now possible to determine if your Safari Web Extension has been turned on by the user. To do so, call SFSafariExtensionManager.stateOfExtension(withIdentifier identifier: String) async throws -> SFSafariExtensionState. The SFSafariExtensionState result has an isEnabled boolean property that lets your app know if the extension has been turned on.\n\nOnce you’ve determined the state of your extension, you may want to help your user understand where to turn it on. With one function call, you can deep link into Safari Extension Settings directly into the view for your extension. To do so, call\n\nSFSafariSettings.openExtensionsSettings(forIdentifiers: [``String``]) async throws and pass in an array of the composed identifiers for your extension(s) as the extensionIdentifiers argument. If you pass a single identifier, the user will be deep linked directly into settings for that extension. If you pass multiple identifiers, the user will be deep linked into Safari Extension Settings and see the list of all installed extension, highlighting the rows of the extensions whose identifiers you passed in.\n\nFinally, if you’re currently shipping a Safari App Extension, Safari 26.2 on macOS introduces improvements to the migration path for your users. Previously, it’s been possible to associate your web extension with an app extension and replace it during an upgrade. By making this association, it would automatically turn the web extension on and hide the app extension. In Safari 26.2 and later, if the Safari web extension replaces a single Safari app extension, Safari also migrates web permissions and the setting that indicates whether the user allows the extension in Private Browsing. Safari only migrates website permissions if the Safari web extension does not require more website access than the Safari app extension.\n\nAlso introduced browser.runtime.getVersion() as a simplified synchronous method to retrieve the installed extension version, replacing the common pattern of runtime.getManifest().version.\n\nAlong with the new features, WebKit for Safari 26.2 includes additional improvements to existing features.\n\nWe love hearing from you.

Thus, “easy” tokens are generated in parallel.\nSome ways in which this is better than speculative decoding is that it is global (works across the entire context, not just for the next K tokens) and doesn’t require running two separate models.\nIn the following example:\n\nRepeat the word grape over and over again.\n\na diffusion language model could generate the prediction “grape” for the entire context length in one step, while in speculative decoding, even if the entire sequence is easily predictable, it can only predict K tokens at a time (typically around 4-8, from what I’ve read).\n\nThis benefit of increased parallel decoding partially depends on the structuredness of a text, which exists on a spectrum. An increase in confidence per output token directly leads to more tokens being decoded on average per step.1\n\nIncreased structure -> reduced entropy -> increased confidence -> higher parallel decoding\n\nThe grape example above is trivially structured, while normal text generation is unstructured and high entropy. Writing code (an actually useful domain) is somewhere in between.\n\nI had a large hunch that for structured tasks (like coding), the average number of tokens generated in parallel per step is higher than in normal text generation, and monotonically increases with the amount of structuredness present in the domain of the output.\n\nI recall reading that Google Gemini was much closer to state of the art for code generation than it was for reasoning tasks when it was first released. Perhaps this improvement for structured tasks is a general motif when it comes to these models?\n\nI threw together a small test and used the model from the paper Fast dLLM v2 (available on Huggingface) to generate roughly 256 tokens for 10 different prompts (each ran 10 times on A100s with an additional 2 generations for warmup):\n\nThe code for everything can be found here, which additionally includes generated output and metadata for each run. Below are the results:\n\nAs predicted, the grape example was dramatically faster than the unstructured text. What was surprising was how much faster (2.33 times speedup!) code generation was compared to unstructured text, even across multiple examples.\n\nMore testing should be done, but I imagine that there is a negative correlation between relative speedup and program complexity, and that boiler plate code (ex. self.input = input) would have a higher speedup compared to logic-heavy sections.\n\nAnother interesting result was that generating the start of the Declaration of Independence, a document which the model must have memorized, didn’t have much speedup. This tiny ablation study suggests that it really is the structuredness of the output, not memorization, which matters.\n\nThis was a small test thrown together in under an hour, and more rigorous evaluations should be done, but these preliminary results hint that this idea might be true to some degree.\n\nAn important limitation to address: In autoregressive decoding, we constrained decoding where we set all syntactically invalid tokens to have a probability of zero, ensuring that we are only generating text which follows some rules (JSON formatting, syntactically correct code, etc). For diffusion language models, this can’t naively be applied. However, similar to figuring out KVCache reuse with the advent of KVCache approximation, we might find a practical solution to this problem.2\n\nRead the section “Confidence-Aware Parallel Decoding” in the paper, Fast-dLLM. ↩︎ ↩︎\n\nThere are lots of papers of doing semi-autoregressive generation using diffusion language models. See AR-Diffusion, Fast-dLLM, Block Diffusion, etc. ↩︎",

Removing the indexes\nis equally painful because it means less efficient JOINs.\n\nThe Uber guy is right that InnoDB handles this better as long as you\ndon't touch the primary key (primary key updates in InnoDB are really bad).\n\nThis is a common problem case we don't have an answer for yet.\n\n-- \n--\nJosh Berkus\nRed Hat OSAS\n(any opinions are my own)",

    "fullText": "In the following weeks, with further help from me and A.I., Peter made a game based on the light-cycle duels in the movie “Tron,” complete with music and a score-keeping system. He sketched the beginnings of a “library simulator,” and finished his own arcade game, Dot in Space, about a tiny spaceship travelling at warp speed. Whenever he hit a potentially momentum-killing bump in the road, A.I. enabled us to roll through it. At my request, the systems began pointing us toward more sophisticated coding environments—Construct, GDevelop, Godot Engine, GameMaker—and suggesting more ambitious projects. Last weekend, he stayed up late, programming a polished version of Asteroids while wolfing down Cheerios and gulping from his water bottle as though it were an energy drink.\n\nSince Peter is a kid, and I’m a dad, all this can seem cute and quaint. Isn’t it nice that A.I. can help a young person learn to code, and an older one become a coding tutor? But consider what’s happening from a different perspective. In “The Wealth of Nations,” Adam Smith described the “acquired and useful abilities” of a worker as a kind of “fixed capital”—something akin to a hunk of real estate or piece of equipment. It wasn’t until the nineteen-sixties that an economist named Theodore Schultz coined the term “human capital” to describe the ongoing, dynamic process through which people invest in improving themselves. Schultz realized that individuals spend a lot of time, money, and effort becoming more capable. They go to night school, network, read self-help books, and tend to use their free time “to improve skills and knowledge.” The work of improving human capital often happens out of sight. But the “simple truth,” he argued, was “that people invest in themselves and that these investments are very large.” Schultz suggested that these investments, which improve “the quality of human effort,” might account “for most of the impressive rise in the real earnings per worker” that economists had observed in the preceding decades.\n\nToday, it’s obvious that companies and organizations benefit greatly from people with lots of human capital. Meetings are more useful when they involve knowledgeable participants; a product improves when the team building it possesses a wide range of skills. What’s less obvious is that companies and organizations simultaneously struggle to recognize and take advantage of changes in human capital. Suppose someone is hired to do one job, and then acquires skills that qualify her for another. Ideally, the organizational chart would shift around her as she becomes more capable; in practice, the job is often a prison. And when a worker breaks out of that prison, by getting a job elsewhere, she takes her human capital with her. For this reason, from the perspective of the company, it’s almost as though the ideal hire is someone who works feverishly to build up their human capital until their first day of work, and then suddenly slows down, becoming a highly skilled cog in the machine. Organizations want their workers to continue improving themselves—but not too fast, lest they outgrow the systems in which they’re enmeshed.",

    "fullText": "Instead of writing my tech comms predictions for next year like I did in 2024, I’ve written a fictionalized account of my day as a technical writer in 2030. It’ll be interesting to see whether we get there or not. Take it as a window into a possible future, one where AI usage is safer, more regulated, and better integrated with our workflows (as it should be).\n\nMy working day starts at 8:30am, after I’ve dropped my kids at school, rushed home, and prepared some coffee surrogate (nobody can afford real coffee anymore). I open the laptop and Chuck is there – it’s always there, like a trusty butler, ready to summarize what’s been going on in pull requests, Slack threads, Jira tickets, and a plethora of other information systems nobody can quite tame. Its summary connects the dots between my current priorities and what’s happening in the teams I’m attached to, helping me decide what to work on next. Trying to be helpful, it offers to deal with some of the mentions I’ve got by opening pull requests; I let it do so with a small docs bug. The rest I’ll want to deal with myself. It asks me how I feel and gently reminds me that I’ve still got some PTO available. Chuck’s such a class act.\n\nI’m in a team with several other technical writers, but for the most part I work with Chuck, which is what we call the in-house AI agent that we use. Chuck is a vast local language model capable of running on the M10 Silicon processor that powers my laptop. It’s a state-of-the-art multimodal LLM whose pedigree I can trace back to the last iterations of Claude Omni 7.5, before Anthropic went bankrupt and got acquired by Apple. As most corporate models, Chuck is ISO 42001, Turing, and EUAI certified, which means that it’s audited every year for security, governance, and legality of its training materials. Chuck is fine-tuned into several variants depending on the goal; the one I use is chuck-256b-writer. We run it in CI pipelines and locally in IDEs or CLI clients. We can also invite it to meetings as an artificial participant. I sometimes ask my own Chuck to attend calls on my behalf as Chuck-Fabri.\n\nThe thing I like the most about Chuck is that I can configure its specializations by turning modules on or off through the Silicon Brain app. When I want it to play the developer, I add several coding modules; when I want it to help me author docs, I turn on the style guide and grammarian modules, and so on. I can also ask Chuck to spawn copies of itself to roleplay users and readers based on support ticket and sales call interactions. When I do that, Chuck politely asks me to call it through other names, so as not to break character, something I duly comply with. Most system tools and APIs are already compatible with the agentic environment I use, so Chuck knows how to perform most operations on its own. An important detail: to summon Chuck, I need to first plug a physical key into the laptop. The key comes with a red button to immediately stop Chuck in case it starts operating bizarrely. Never had to use it.\n\nIt’s 11am already. I’ve been working with Chuck to write a new docs set for a new feature, telling it how I wanted the docs to fit into the existing architecture and instructing it to tweak and edit. It almost always gets 80% of the work done, though I often have to intervene to rearrange, cut, or otherwise rewrite sections. This hasn’t changed since the first days of GPT and it’ll never improve, because LLMs are not intelligent. They’re the most useful word automation tools at my disposal though, which I keep in check through deterministic tools and linters. Chuck is able to create diagrams, take screenshots of the product through an internal tool, and test the instructions and code snippets itself. When I feel unsure about its output, I ask it to verify what it’s just written through semantic internal search, or by calling its cloud cousin, Chad, which is able to provide answers from federated internal sources. All we do together, Chuck documents internally and remembers in its permanent context.\n\nEven though I’m using a local, non-monetized, and fully audited model that consumes the equivalent of a lightbulb worth of power, I still can’t shake the feeling of being a reverse centaur at times. It helps that Chuck comes with several built-in safeguards meant to prevent me from overworking or spending too much time without interacting with other human beings. At 1pm, which is lunch time in Spain, Chuck reminds me about taking a break. It refuses to continue if it detects stress in my text, vocal, or computer usage patterns. While my interactions with Chuck on the laptop are private and encrypted, it’s allowed to inform my manager or call my designated emergency contact in case of distress. I let Chuck access my vitals on the smartwatch and schedule calls with me on a regular basis to see how I’m doing. Since I work alone at home, this makes me feel somewhat safer.\n\nI didn’t tell you, but my current job title is Augmented Writer. My mission is to ensure that the words that humans and machines use to interact with our products are the most effective at reducing confusion and error, while they maximize effectiveness and user satisfaction. I’m augmented because I do this in concert with Chuck, which expands my existing skills in numerous ways. Without my brain, though, Chuck couldn’t do my job, because it doesn’t really care and, more importantly, because it’s not allowed to. One of the conditions imposed by the current legislation is that AI cannot operate in fully autonomous mode without human supervision. Our docs and UIs, in fact, bear a certificate of human authorship that discloses the amount of AI intervention. By law, all AI generated artifacts must produce fingerprinting patterns that can’t be tampered with, which is trickier with text, but since we must keep full audit logs of LLM usage, this can be established upon request by any competent authority, including the Turing police.\n\nIn the end, my role is more of an orchestrator than that of an author, and I’m fine with that. Software engineering, the field I serve, is an exercise in consensual imagination whose goal is to find repeatable ways of processing reality into manageable chunks of data. Reality is unmistakably raw and imperfect, a stream of floating points and broken strings running through distributed systems: one cannot tame it through clever algorithms, but it can be reduced to abstractions and data structures and binary blobs. Each of those entities has a name; they all relate to each other through words. It’s part of my job to understand those words and intervene when they don’t bring clarity. It’s then also my job to explain how those words are able to handle their parent reality. The docs I orchestrate with Chuck’s help are the artifacts that chronicle and explain the motions of data as it enters a machine and exits in shapes and configurations that are helpful to users.\n\nIt’s 5pm and I’m bidding Chuck farewell. During the night, it will work on some optional docs polish and politely present its work to me in the morning. As I log off and extract the hardware key from the laptop, I think that without the words Chuck and I produced, the machine would be opaque to its operators, a smooth wall without doors or handles. Product truth is at my disposal to weave into a fabric of meaning and possibility, into spells that unlock abilities in autonomous agents, be they organic or artificial. I am an enabler of thought and action. Getting here wasn’t easy, but I feel better knowing that I can continue defending the importance of words with the help of the most clever thesaurus ever created.",

    "fullText": "The team behind what has been described as ‘one of the most significant mosaics discovered in the UK’ have revealed that it depicts an alternative ‘long-lost’ telling of the Trojan War.\n\nNew research from the University of Leicester has conclusively determined why the famous Ketton mosaic in Rutland – one of the most remarkable Roman discoveries in Britain for a century – cannot depict scenes from Homer’s Iliad as was initially believed. Instead, it draws on an alternative version of the Trojan War story first popularised by the Greek playwright Aeschylus that has since been lost to history.\n\nThe mosaic’s images combine artistic patterns and designs that had already been circulating for hundreds of years across the ancient Mediterranean, suggesting that craftsmen in Roman Britain were more closely connected to the wider classical world than has been assumed.\n\nThe Ketton mosaic was discovered in 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdown by local resident Jim Irvine, leading to a major excavation by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), with funding from Historic England. The mosaic and surrounding villa complex have since been designated a Scheduled Monument in recognition of their exceptional national importance. Historic England and ULAS undertook collaborative excavations at the site in 2021 and 2022 and are working together to publish the results of those investigations.\n\nThe mosaic depicts the Greek hero Achilles and the Trojan prince Hector in three dramatic scenes – their duel, the dragging of Hector’s body, and its eventual ransom by King Priam, where Hector’s body is literally weighed for gold.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Loons are on the mend in Maine, filling more of the state's lakes and ponds with their haunting calls, although conservations say the birds aren't out of the woods yet.\n\nMaine is home to a few thousand of the distinctive black-and-white waterbirds — the East Coast’s largest loon population — and conservationists said efforts to protect them from threats helped grow the population. An annual count of common loons found more adults and chicks this year than last, Maine Audubon said this week.\n\nThe group said it estimated a population for the southern half of Maine of 3,174 adult loons and 568 chicks. Audubon bases its count on the southern portion of Maine because there are enough bird counters to get a reliable number. The count is more than twice the number when they started counting in 1983, and the count of adult adult loons has increased 13% from 10 years ago.\n\n“We’re cautiously optimistic after seeing two years of growing chick numbers,” said Maine Audubon wildlife ecologist Tracy Hart. “But it will take several more years before we know if that is a real upward trend, or just two really good years.”\n\nMaine lawmakers have attempted to grow the population of the loons with bans on lead fishing tackle that the birds sometimes accidentally swallow. Laws that limit boat speeds have also helped because they prevent boat wakes from washing out nests, conservation groups say.\n\nIt's still too early to know if Maine's loons are on a sustainable path to recovery, and the success of the state's breeding loons is critical to the population at large, Hart said. Maine has thousands more loons than the other New England states, with the other five states combining for about 1,000 adults. The state is home to one of the largest populations of loons in the U.S., which has about 27,000 breeding adults in total.\n\nMinnesota has the most loons in the lower 48 states, with a fairly stable population of about 12,000 adults, but they are in decline in some parts of their range.\n\nWhile loons are not listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, they are considered threatened by some states, including New Hampshire and Michigan. The U.S. Forest Service also considers the common loon a sensitive species.\n\nThe birds migrate to the ocean in late fall and need a long runway to take off, meaning winter can be a treacherous time for the birds because they get trapped by ice in the lakes and ponds where they breed, said Barb Haney, executive director of Avian Haven, a wildlife rehabilitation center in Freedom, Maine.\n\n“We're getting a lot of calls about loons that are iced in,” Haney said, adding that the center was tending to one such patient this week.",

    "description": "It's unimaginably vast.",
    "fullText": "Astronomers have observed enormous filaments of galaxies tied together with dark matter — the stuff scientists believe makes up 85 percent of the total mass of the universe — stretching across unfathomably vast distances.\n\nSome of these behemoth structures have been observed to spin in the same direction, a dazzling and mysterious cosmic dance stretching across tens of millions of light-years, and a tantalizing clue in our efforts to understand how galaxies, and eventually stars, are formed.\n\nNow, an international team of researchers led by the University of Oxford says it has spotted the largest one of these rotating structures ever identified using data from South Africa’s MeerKAT radio telescope, an array of 64 linked satellite dishes.\n\nAs detailed in a study published this month in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, they observed 14 galaxies arranged in a “razor-thin” string that measures roughly 5.5 million light-years long and 117,000 light-years across. This structure is located inside a much larger filament that contains 280 other galaxies, reaching a length of 50 million light-years.\n\nMany of these hundreds of galaxies appear to be rotating in the same direction as the overarching filament itself.\n\n“This is the largest individual spinning structure so far detected,” colead author and University of Oxford postdoctoral researcher Lyla Jung told Reuters. “Statistically, we believe there are other spinning structures, some of which could be larger. However, we have not been able to detect them directly with our current data and telescopes.”\n\nThe discovery suggests these structures can influence the spin of galaxies for longer, and more strongly, than previously thought.\n\n“What makes this structure exceptional is not just its size, but the combination of spin alignment and rotational motion,” Jung said in a statement about the work.\n\n“You can liken it to the teacups ride at a theme park,” she added. “Each galaxy is like a spinning teacup, but the whole platform- the cosmic filament -is rotating too. This dual motion gives us rare insight into how galaxies gain their spin from the larger structures they live in.”\n\nThe researchers suggest the filament is still fairly young after finding it’s in a “dynamically cold” state. The hydrogen-gas-rich galaxies within may still be gathering fuel to spit out stars, an intriguing glimpse into the earliest stages of a galaxy’s evolution.\n\n“This filament is a fossil record of cosmic flows,” said colead author and University of Cambridge postdoctoral research assistant Madalina Tudorache in the statement.\n\nThe findings also detail how this gas is being swirled around inside the filament, which could inform future observation efforts using the European Space Agency’s Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.\n\n“This is a very exciting time to work in this field, as our capacity of discovering such structures is increasing with the advent of better radio and optical surveys,” Tudorache told Reuters. “It will deepen our understanding of the universe.”\n\nMore on cosmic filaments: Scientists Detect “Strange Filaments” at the Heart of Our Galaxy",

    "fullText": "Thanks to an extra-rainy autumn, Fresno temperatures are more frigid than usual and eight degrees colder, year-over-year.\n\nThe average temperature from Dec. 1 to Dec. 10 usually sits at around 49 degrees. Last year saw a 52-degree average for the same timeframe, though temperatures this year are currently averaging a crisp 44 degrees.\n\nStephen McCoy, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Hanford, said the colder temperatures are on account of the early-season rainfall.\n\nWith the added moisture, a cloud deck formed, bringing the overcast weather we’ve been experiencing for weeks. McCoy said an area of high-pressure is situated above the cloud barrier, keeping it from dissipating.\n\nThis low layer of clouds keeps sunlight from penetrating, impacting temperatures.\n\nMeanwhile, foothill communities situated above the low-lying clouds are enjoying sunshine. While Fresno’s weather hovered around 45 degrees Thursday, McCoy said Oakhurst experienced a 77-degree day.\n\nMcCoy said the colder-than-usual temperatures would continue until the cloud deck is broken up by some low-level winds or rain.\n\nFresno’s rain year runs from Oct. 1 to Sep. 30. Typically, between Oct. 1 to Dec. 10, Fresno experiences 1.95 inches of rainfall. This year brought more than double with a total of 4.04 inches.\n\nMcCoy pinpointed this additional moisture as the driver behind the low clouds, blocking out the sun and bringing unseasonably cold temperatures.",

Police had to disperse angry farmers as they escorted in a team to carry out the culling.\n\nSeveral unions have said that slaughtering whole herds is ineffective, calling for blockades across France \"to put an end to this madness\".\n\nOn Saturday, dozens of tractors blocked traffic, while others parked in front of public buildings, as farmers set fire to bales of straw and tyres.\n\nNearly 150 kilometres of the A64 motorway between Bayonne and Tarbes were closed to traffic due to blockades that began late Friday.\n\nLumpy skin disease, which cannot be passed to humans but can be fatal for cattle, first appeared in France in June.\n\nThe official strategy to stamp out what the authorities describe as a very contagious disease has been to slaughter all animals in affected herds, and carry out \"emergency vaccination\" of all cattle within a 50-kilometre (30-mile) radius.\n\n\"It's the extermination of cows and farmers,\" said Leon Thierry of hard-line farmers' union Coordination Rurale (CR), who protested in the town of Briscous with more than a dozen farmers and around 40 tractors.\n\n\"It is out of the question that in the Pyrenees we should slaughter animals that are not sick, that are healthy, because they belong to a herd from which, supposedly, a sick animal has emerged,\" he said.\n\nAround a hundred farmers gathered in Carbonne located some 40 kilometres southwest of Toulouse, setting up camp on the A64 highway.\n\n\"They deploy riot police to kill 200 cows, but you don't see them at the drug-dealing spots!\" said Benjamin Kalanquin, 24, who works not far from the farm where the entire herd was slaughtered.\n\n\"Total slaughter is not the solution,\" he said, vowing to camp on the motorway until Christmas \"if there is no convincing response\".\n\n\"People are fed up,\" added Benjamin Roquebert, 37.\n\n\"You can't build up a herd in five minutes,\" added the cattle breeder and grain producer. \"It's a lifetime of work, spanning several generations.\"\n\nThe protesters also say the government is not doing enough to protect them.\n\nThe European Union next week expected to sign on to a trade deal with South America that farmers say will flood the market with cheap agricultural products that will outcompete them.\n\n\"We're struggling, we can't eat, we can't even make 1,000 euros a month,\" said another protester, Aurelien Marti.\n\nAround 70 farmers sounded their horns and set off firecrackers and smoke bombs in front of the agriculture minister's former parliamentary office in the eastern town of Pontarlier. They hung a dead calf from a tree with a sign saying \"Our Animals, Our Life.\"\n\nAgriculture Minister Annie Genevard said on Saturday the government planned to vaccinate one million head of cattle in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine and Occitanie regions.\n\n\"In the coming weeks, we will vaccinate nearly one million animals, thereby protecting farmers,\" she told Ici Occitanie radio.\n\nThose vaccinations would be in addition to the million head of cattle already vaccinated since July, the agriculture ministry told AFP.\n\nThe culls have divided farmers' unions.\n\nCoordination Rurale and Confederation Paysanne are united against the widespread cullings and have called for a vaccination campaign.\n\nThe leading FNSEA farming union supports the total culling of affected herds.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump raged in a dead-of-night social media post at Republicans who defied him on a plan that would have given the GOP more seats in Congress.\n\nThe Indiana State Senate voted down a redistricting plan Trump pushed hard to give Republicans two more congressional seats, defeating it by a 31-19 margin — including a majority of Republicans.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about the vote just after it happened, he downplayed his role in supporting the plan:\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I wasn’t working on it very hard. Would have been nice, I think we would have picked up two seats, if we did that. You had one gentleman, the head of the Senate, I guess, Bray, whatever his name is, I heard he was against it. He’ll probably lose his next primary, whenever that is. I hope he does, because he’s done a tremendous disservice.\n\nBut the issue kept Trump awake into the early hours Saturday morning. It was almost one o’clock in the morning when Trump posted a threatening rant to his Truth Social account:\n\nRepublicans in the Indiana State Senate, who voted against a Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, should be ashamed of themselves. Headed by a total loser named Rod Bray, every one of these people should be “primaried,” and I will be there to help! Indiana, which I won big, is the only state in the Union to do this!\n\nThe rant came hours after Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) tried to downplay the significance of the vote and its effect on Trump’s stature.\n\nCNN’s Manu Raju asked Johnson, on Friday, “Are you worried about Trump’s grip on power after Indiana? Do you think it shows he’s a lame duck?”\n\n“Not at all! No, he is not a lame duck!” Johnson said. “He’s the most powerful president of this generation and many others. We have a lot more work to do together. The outcome in Indiana is inconsequential to that.”\n\nThe post Trump Rages In Dead Of Night At Republicans Who Defied Him On Election Map — After Claiming He Hadn’t ‘Worked Very Hard’ On It first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "T-Mobile, one of the top three phone carriers in the U.S., is reportedly following in the footsteps of one of its main competitors as it rapidly loses loyal customers.\n\nIn September, T-Mobile made it loud and clear that it is heading in a new direction when it named Srini Gopalan as its new CEO, officially replacing Mike Sievert, who had held the position for over five years, on Nov. 1.\n\nThe change came after T-Mobile revealed in its latest earnings report that during the third quarter of this year, its postpaid phone churn (the number of customers who canceled their phone service) climbed by three basis points year over year.\n\nThe increased customer losses follow the phone carrier’s recent price increases, discounts removals and phone plan changes. As more Americans battle higher costs of living nationwide, many are exploring cheaper phone plan options with nontraditional carriers, according to a recent survey from Oxio.\n\nApproximately 90% of consumers would consider alternatives to traditional carriers.\n\nAlso, 85% consider cost to be a primary factor in mobile provider selection.\n\nAdditionally, 46% of consumersrank a lower-priced plan as their main reason for switching providers, while 33% prioritize better network coverage.\n\n“The research shows that many consumers are looking for greater plan clarity and value – they want services that match what they actually use,” said Oxio CcxEO Nicolas Girard in a statement. “We’re seeing a strong interest in personalization, transparency and more control over mobile services.”\n\nGopalan has previously announced that T-Mobile is undergoing a “digital transformation” to tackle customer pain points.\n\n“The amount of friction and frustration we cause customers today because of our processes and the state of evolution in this industry is phenomenal,” said Gopalan during an earnings call in October. “We have a huge opportunity to change that with our digital transformation.”\n\nOne of the significant changes reportedly part of T-Mobile’s digital transformation is making customers solely dependent on its T-Life app to handle upgrades, new lines, account activations, and other tasks by January 2026.\n\nAs this new transformation sets in, some T-Mobile employees recently took to social media platform Reddit to reveal that they were suddenly laid off from the company.\n\nIn a Dec. 9 Reddit post, a Reddit user sounded the alarm about being notified of job cuts affecting T-Mobile employees who were account executives and sales managers at the company.",

    "fullText": "UFC veteran Alex Garcia was among three suspects arrested Monday in Montreal alongside 102 kilograms of cocaine and other drugs, cash, vehicles and guns in what local Canadian authorities called a \"major\" raid by the city's anti-gang unit. Montreal police announced the arrests in a news release Wednesday.\n\nIn addition to the substantial amount of cocaine, which is valued at more than $2.3 million CAD ($1.7 million USD), approximately 5 kilograms of heroin, 20 liters of GHB, $306,000 CAD in cash ($223,000 USD), three firearms and two vehicles were seized by police in the bust.\n\n“Launched in July 2025, this criminal investigation revealed that the Toronto area was being used as a supply source and that the drugs were then being resold at a higher price in Greater Montreal.\"\n\nGarcia, 38, competed 10 times in the UFC welterweight division from 2013-18, compiling a 5-5 promotional record before being released following back-to-back decision losses to Ryan LaFlare and Court McGee. Garcia then competed twice more with Russian regional promotion ACA, losing via knockouts at the hands of Ibragim Chuzhigaev in 2019 and Abdul-Rahman Dzhanaev in early 2020.\n\nMichele Laddaga, 49, and Victor Julio Sanchez Medrano, 45, were also arrested alongside Garcia in the raid.

    "description": "The so-called Brabant Killers gunned down shoppers, families and children across Belgium, and the case remains unsolved decades later",
    "fullText": "A masked trio known as the Brabant Killers attacked Belgian grocery stores and other businesses between 1982 and 1985, leaving 28 people dead\n\nSurvivors included David Van de Steen, who lost his parents and sister, and Geneviève Van Lidth, who later said she recognized one attacker\n\nInvestigators reviewed thousands of leads over decades and closed the case in 2024 without identifying the men responsible\n\nBetween 1982 and 1985, a masked trio known as the \"Crazy Killers of Brabant\" carried out a wave of supermarket massacres across Belgium’s Brabant region, murdering 28 people — among them families and young children.\n\nThe men used face paint during the raids and were nicknamed the Giant, the Killer and the Old Man by investigators and the press, according to the BBC. They were never identified.\n\nThe outlet reported that the attacks unfolded in two main waves and targeted supermarkets, hostels, a gunsmith’s shop, a bar and a restaurant. Some victims were tortured before being killed, the outlet reported.\n\nOn Nov. 9, 1985, eight people were killed during an attack on a Delhaize grocery store in the city of Aalst, per the BBC.\n\nTwo brothers, then ages 7 and 10, later said they saw six men in dark clothing fleeing the scene, and the boys wrote down a car’s registration number in a notebook as part of a childhood hobby. CBS News, citing AFP, reported that the notebook was logged in the case file but the lead was not pursued for decades and the brothers were never questioned.\n\nOne survivor of the Aalst attack, David Van de Steen — who was seriously injured at age 9 and lost both his parents and his sister — later said that his sister shouted, “Don’t shoot, that’s my dad!” before their father was killed, according to The Bulletin.\n\nAnother victim, a woman named Geneviève Van Lidth, was one of the few people to see one of the attackers without a mask. In 1983, she had her car stolen at gunpoint outside her house in Plancenoit, Walloon Brabant.\n\nShe later described the man as having seemingly southern European origins, with short, curly black hair and “impeccable” French that made him seem well-educated, and said a Peugeot 504 that followed her car was later tied to a Delhaize attack in Genval, per The Brussels Times’ summary of her account.\n\n“I always said he had a northern French accent, that he wasn’t Belgian,” she said, per the outlet, adding that she was “99% sure” she recognized her attacker when shown a photograph years later.\n\nThe Guardian reported that investigators once examined whether the attacks were an attempt to destabilize Belgium by current or former law enforcement officers with far-right ties. AFP reporting cited by the outlet also noted a long-circulated theory that the Giant may have been a former member of the gendarmerie, Belgium's national police force.\n\nIn 2019, a retired police officer was charged with allegedly dumping weapons and ammunition linked to the case in a canal in 1986, but he was never convicted, according to The Guardian.\n\nIn 2017, The Guardian reported that the brother of a former Belgian policeman, Christiaan Bonkoffsky, had confessed two years earlier to being \"the Giant.\" Patricia Finne, whose father was among the 28 people killed, told the outlet that the disclosure was \"the first serious revelation in 30 years.\"\n\n\"I really hope that this will lead to dismantling the rest of the gang, whether they are dead or not,\" she told the outlet.\n\nThe total amount stolen across the robberies was estimated at about €175,000, The Guardian reported.\n\nAccording to the outlet, prosecutors told victims’ families that investigators had checked 1,815 pieces of information, examined 2,748 sets of fingerprints, compared 593 DNA samples and exhumed more than 40 bodies without identifying the killers. No one has ever been convicted in the case.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nIn 2020, police released a photograph of an unidentified man standing in a wooded area near a lake while holding a shotgun. Investigators described it as a “vital lead” in the case and appealed for help identifying him, per BBC and The Guardian reporting.\n\nIn June 2024, despite Bonkoffsky's 2017 confession about being \"the Giant,\" Belgian federal prosecutors announced that the case was being closed after more than four decades of investigation, The Guardian reported. Families were told that “all possible investigative actions have been carried out,” according to the outlet.\n\n“This means the case is now buried and it makes me very sad,” said Irena Palsterman, whose father was among the eight victims of the Aalst attack, per the outlet.\n\nCBS News, citing AFP, reported that an appeals court in Mons later ordered investigators to hear two additional witnesses, including the brothers who recorded the license plate number before the Aalst attack.\n\n“We don’t want to give up,” said Kristiaan Vandenbussche, a lawyer representing families of the victims, according to the outlet.",

    "description": "I wanted my family of five to travel more, so I created budgeting strategies to take more vacations. I know when to splurge and when to save.",
    "fullText": "I used to scroll through friends' glamorous-looking vacation photos and feel a familiar pang, knowing there was no way my family could afford trips like that. But I didn't want to stew in jealousy, so I decided to figure out how we could travel more on our budget.\n\nSince some of my favorite travel memories aren't from far-off places but from day adventures or quick weekend trips, I learned to prioritize them in our calendar. Mini vacations are cheaper — no flights, rental cars, time off work, or dog sitters needed, since we generally bring our dog on these trips or leave her with the neighbor.\n\nWe live in Arizona, so we schedule hiking excursions with friends to Sedona's Red Rocks or other scenic areas at least once every few months. We also visit my parents, who live an hour and a half north of us, enjoying their cooler weather and small-town charm.\n\nHowever, I don't want my family to miss out on exploring beyond our little bubble, so my next tactical move was to maximize credit card points.\n\nI'd earned free flights and hotels before, but my friend showed me I had more to learn.\n\nOver the past two years, I've signed up for credit cards when the point offers looked too good to pass up. I often book under my friend's referral link, so we both earn bonuses. My husband then signs up using mine, and we add each other as authorized users, often for extra points.\n\nI currently have nine credit cards. It sounds intimidating, but it's manageable as I never add more than one sign-up bonus at a time. Closing cards can ding your credit score, so I phase them out slowly.\n\nSome, though, I'll keep long-term, like my Sapphire card with its zero foreign transaction fees and great travel partners, and my Southwest card, which allows me to book flights with my Rapid Rewards points and offers one free checked bag for myself and up to eight guests.\n\nBecause the Sapphire card's points can be transferred to Southwest, I was able to combine them and book a flight for my family of five to Washington, D.C., this summer. The flight cost me 130,000 Rapid Rewards points, which is about $1,300. The only thing I paid out of pocket was the $56 in security fees. Then I used 78,914 introductory points from my husband's new Sapphire Chase card, valued at $788, to pay for half of our five-night hotel stay in Georgetown. In total, I saved around $2000.\n\nOne caveat: I always pay my credit cards off monthly. I want to be the one benefiting — not the credit card company.\n\nWe often split hotels or Airbnbs with family or friends. Sharing costs makes trips more economical and usually more fun. We plan meals together, too, when the place we're staying has a kitchen, which further cuts costs.\n\nI discovered that when new properties are listed on Airbnb, the first few stays are often discounted to drive more bookings and garner reviews. We've stayed in some upgraded places using this tactic. On an upcoming trip to Europe, I found a two-bedroom flat in London's city center with only a few reviews, offering a better deal at $970 for four nights, while many nearby properties were $1,300 or more.\n\nWhile in Europe, we plan to take trains to and from a few cities. I was shocked by train costs. That's how I found Omio, which helped me compare, purchase, and store tickets for train, bus, and ferry trips in one place, saving me time and money.\n\nWhen traveling, we rely on public transportation if the city is well-connected, only hopping in a rideshare or taxi if we are worn out. If we do need a rental car, I usually check a few companies to find the best deal, as rates can vary significantly.\n\nOn a seven-day trip to Maui in 2024, I found the best deal by booking directly with Alamo through my Sapphire rewards program. I secured a Chrysler Pacifica for 48,989 points, which equates to around $490.\n\nMy dad's vacation rule: splurge on a nice hotel for a few nights, then switch to budget options. Admittedly, I am scarred by that one cockroach-infested motel he booked when I was 11, so I never go too budget. Still, I like his thinking. If we're traveling to multiple cities, we often take this approach, staying in one nicer place and then offsetting it with something more budget-friendly in the next.\n\nEven with hacks, traveling is an expensive undertaking. Tucking money into a vacation fund every month helps, and staying strategic is key. For me, experiencing new places as a family is worth prioritizing.",

    "fullText": "I was surprised when my daughter told me she wanted not only to attend college but also to pursue medical school. She even planned out her prerequisite classes, residency, and potential debt.\n\nIn our house, we rarely talked about college because I never went. My husband also only did a few semesters at community college.\n\nHigher education was never a requirement in our house. I never expected my daughters to enroll and take on student loan debt because I found a path to entrepreneurship without all of that.\n\nAnd yet, both of my daughters want to go to college, and I respect their decision.\n\nMy mom has been a salon owner in Baltimore for over 35 years. The salon was my after-school program, my social circle, and my introduction to business. I learned early that work is more than a paycheck. It is the foundation for the kind of life you want to live.\n\nMy mom didn't talk about freedom in a motivational sense. She lived it. She set her own schedule and ran the business in a way that made sense for her. Watching that shaped me more than any degree ever could.\n\nWhen I graduated from high school and had my first child at 18, I didn't even consider college — not because I felt incapable. I simply didn't believe a traditional route was required to build the life that I envisioned for myself.\n\nMy mom taught me how to work hard, how to serve people well, and how to think independently. I built my early adulthood on those values and eventually became an entrepreneur myself, returning to my mother's salon as a co-owner. Everything I learned about resilience, money, and adaptability came from living real life, not writing dissertations about it in a lecture hall.\n\nThe lessons my daughters absorbed from me were not about degrees. The lessons were more about self-discipline and financial awareness. I taught them how to budget. I taught them how to track their spending. I taught them why credit matters and how debt can limit your life before adulthood even begins.\n\nWhen my oldest turned 16 and got her first job, she learned to manage money the same way I did. She made mistakes, then corrected them. She saved. She budgeted. She paid attention. Now she supports herself as a server while attending college using financial aid and cash she earns. She files her own taxes. She pays her own bills. She manages tuition payment plans with intention instead of fear.\n\nWatching her handle her life this way reminds me that independence is a muscle; if you teach your kids how to use it, they grow strong without you having to push.\n\nMy youngest, now a high school senior, is also preparing for college. She has a different personality but the same drive. She does her research. She looks up scholarships. She treats her future like something she is shaping, rather than something that is happening to her. I see two young women who understand the financial reality of higher education but aren't intimidated by it.\n\nThere is immense pride in the fact that my daughters are finding their own way in life, but there is also a quiet ache. You spend years pouring into your children. Then, suddenly, you are watching them become adults who no longer want to live the life you envisioned for them.\n\nAvoiding college debt gave me a certain kind of freedom. Teaching my daughters about money and independence gave them the freedom to make choices. Seeing them use those choices to stretch beyond my experiences feels like the true return on everything I poured into them.\n\nThe goal was never to avoid college. It was about creating a foundation strong enough for them to choose their own direction. Watching them do that is the greatest return on investment I could ever receive.",

    "description": "A dietitian who got into triathlon training after cancer treatment shares her best nutrition tips.",
    "fullText": "At 38, Cassandra Burke was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer after she felt a shooting pain in her right breast.\n\nShe'd caught it early, but it was no easy ride. She underwent a grueling treatment protocol: a lumpectomy, a year of chemotherapy, 33 days of radiation, skin grafting (to fix dead tissue from her lumpectomy), and a precautionary hysterectomy (her aunt was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer).\n\n\"My treatment was pretty aggressive, so it really did take a toll on me,\" Burke, 54, told Business Insider. \"It was pretty brutal to move my body.\"\n\nBut she had one goal: to finish her first triathlon. She set her sights on Iron Girl: A 0.62-mile swim, a 16-mile bike ride, and a 3.4-mile run in her home state of Maryland. After finishing it, she did another Iron Girl two weeks later in Syracuse, New York. She was hooked.\n\nIt also drove her to learn more about her body and the role nutrition plays in optimizing performance. She got personal training and triathlon coach certifications along with her registered dietitian's licensure. Now, while still running a forensic science laboratory, she coaches local athletes from ages 6 to 18 as well as virtual adult and high school clients. She also provides nutrition guidance to cancer patients from her oncology center.\n\nThese days, she organizes her nutrition around the workout, which sometimes means two workout sessions in one day or a few hours of running or biking on the weekends.\n\nBurke shared how she fuels for her training and follows a balanced diet to maximize her nutrient intake.\n\nNow 15 years cancer-free, Burke has since completed nearly 80 running events, including 27 triathlons and 18 half marathons.\n\nBurke usually works out in the morning before work — usually doing a combination of swimming, biking, running, or strength training, depending on the day.\n\nFor a quick energy boost, she focuses on carbs and simple sugar. She might eat a few waffles, a sports gel like Gu or UCAN, or a high-carb powder like Skratch Labs.\n\n\"I'll eat carb-heavy,\" she said. \"I just want that simple sugar, so I'm not depleting my own glycogen as much as possible.\" She also incorporates gels and electrolytes, like Liquid IV, throughout her training sessions as well.\n\nBurke's first real meal of the day is usually the breakfast she has after training. To speed up her body's muscle repair and replenish glycogen, she aims for about 20 to 30 grams of protein and about 60 grams of carbohydrates in that first big meal.\n\nShe'll eat whichever meal hits those goals, whether or not it feels like a typical American breakfast. Sometimes it's a bibimbap made with leftover rice, eggs, vegetables, and a homemade gochujang sauce. Other times, it's a turkey sandwich, or cottage cheese with banana and mandarin oranges.\n\n\"That's what I teach my athletes — performance nutrition is based on what the macro is, not what the food is,\" she said. \"So enjoy the foods that you like and the combinations that help your performance, and don't worry that it's not your typical egg-and-toast or breakfast cereal.\"\n\nBurke more or less follows the Mediterranean diet, focusing on lean protein sources (like chicken, fish, and eggs), whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\n\nAfter her breakfast, she tries to calculate the nutrients she feels she's missing. \"Throughout the rest of the day, I just put in what I know I need through snacks and meals,\" she said.\n\nShe sneaks protein-rich food sources into her snacks, such as making high-fiber parfaits with Greek yogurt, granola, and fresh fruit, or creating her own version of Starbucks' bacon and Gruyere egg bites by blending cottage cheese into the mix.\n\nOther meals, like her homemade Mexican- or Asian-style rice bowls, feature a range of vegetables for extra fiber and nutrients. \"I'm big on 'eat the rainbow' with my clients,\" she said. \" Practicing what I preach, I try to make sure I'm getting different colors and varieties of fruits and vegetables throughout the week.\"",

    "description": "I was convinced AI was ruining human connection. Then my husband used it to write the most heartfelt anniversary card I've ever received.",
    "fullText": "As a geriatric millennial and a licensed psychologist, I often lament technological changes that I see as threatening to human interactions, such as AI.\n\nEven though I try to find the gray in all areas of life, I've been rather black-and-white about AI because I worry it's diminishing our ability to relate to one another.\n\nHowever, a recent experience with my husband has made me more curious about AI.\n\nWe recently celebrated our ninth wedding anniversary, and unbeknownst to me at the time, my husband used GenAI to write my card. He was traveling at the time, so he sent flowers and chocolate, with a card attached. The flowers were severely underwhelming, and I'm not just being a brat. My husband even called the company upon returning to express his frustration with how different they appeared in person.\n\nBut when I read the note accompanying the tiny arrangement, I teared up right away. It was heartwarming, meaningful, and really on the nose.\n\nMy husband's lack of romantic effusiveness has historically been frustrating to me. He has made steady progress in this area, and even ending cards with \"love\" more frequently marks such improvement. So, this note felt in line with his desire to share more emotionality, and I was touched that he'd taken that step just because he knew it would make me happy.\n\nMy husband knows about my big feelings about AI, and he shares many of them. It seems like everyone relies on ChatGPT for relationship advice, and the most common use of META AI right now is to ask for guidance about difficult conversations with loved ones or bosses. I see it in my therapy practice all the time, and I'm skeptical about how sound the AI advice my clients receive actually is.\n\nSo, when I, a historically staunch critic of all things AI, found out that my husband had used ChatGPT to create our anniversary card, I admit I had some strong feelings.\n\nAs lacking in the sentimental department as my husband can be, I am at the opposite end of the spectrum — a hopeless romantic, as they say. I save just about every card I get, tucked into a neat little box. When I reread my husband's card before putting it away, I found myself lingering on some of the words. \"…life we built together\" especially sat with me. It's a common phrase, but it's not in my husband's emotional lexicon. It almost sounded like somebody else's voice. And given that we can't go more than a few days without reading about how AI will ruin people's ability to think for themselves, I had that thought. \"Did AI write one of the sweetest parts of my anniversary card?\"\n\nI was delicate. I reiterated how much I'd enjoyed our belated anniversary celebration before I asked: \"Did you use AI to write our anniversary card?\" He copped to it, grinning from ear to ear.\n\nShockingly to me, I wasn't mad. This discovery actually opened a door for us to talk about how useful it is to get a little help writing a card. The pre-printed messages often feel overly mushy, and the \"blank inside\" cards ask us to get vulnerable in expressing our emotions. For many, including my husband, that's incredibly difficult. The result is often a message that neither the giver nor the receiver feels particularly happy about.\n\nBut this year's note was perfectly balanced. The right amount of gush without the melodrama. I felt seen, and I felt it captured our relationship well.\n\nIf AI can help people express their love for one another, that can't be a bad thing, right? Besides, is asking ChatGPT for help any less authentic than using a pre-printed Hallmark message? ChatGPT provided more accurate information about our relationship than a Hallmark writer ever could, and it offered guidance for a note that made me feel loved and appreciated.\n\nWhile the idea of a world in which chatbots replace our friends and therapists is still deeply concerning to me, this recent experience has helped me find the gray in my previously black-and-white view: I don't know that I'll ever come around to AI replacing human connection, but I do see the utility now in using AI to help us enhance our existing human connections.\n\nAt the very least, I look forward to more anniversaries with really accurate love notes.",

    "description": "Lynne Austin was working as a telephone operator doing bikini contests as a side gig when she was approach with an opportunity that changed her life.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations between Business Insider's Liz Rowley and Jess Orwig with Lynne Austin, 64, the original Hooters Girl and a 42-year veteran of the company. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been proud to be the original Hooters Girl since day one, when we didn't even know we would be what we are today.\n\nI got involved with Hooters in 1983. I was 22, working as a telephone operator and doing bikini contests as a side gig. After winning a contest on Clearwater Beach, the secretary of Ed Droste, one of Hooters' founders, approached me and said I'd be a perfect billboard girl for a restaurant that Ed and his partners were ready to open.\n\nI thought, \"I don't even know what a billboard girl is.\" Instead, I told her, \"Sure, OK.\" I took his card, went home, and forgot all about it. Two months later, I was driving to another bikini contest, and I saw a construction sign: \"Coming soon: Hooters.\" I made a hard right toward the parking lot, and that turn changed my life.\n\nWatch Lynne, Ed, and other famous Hooters names recall the early days and how the company has evolved over more than four decades:\n\nI was totally into the idea of being the Hooters Girl, wearing the uniform, and posing for pics. What I wasn't so wowed by was the idea of quitting my job and becoming a waitress, but Ed persuaded me with talk about \"world fame,\" so I figured, why not give it a shot?\n\nI quit my job in July 1983 because Hooters was supposed to open around the first week of August. Then September rolled around, and we still weren't open due to some licensing issues, and I was getting nervous because I wasn't making any money.\n\nI told Ed I needed a job, and he pointed me to one of the owners, Gil DiGiannantonio, who told me to come down and they'd find something for me. He put me to work scrubbing refrigerators, stoves, and other kitchen appliances for the restaurant for $5 an hour until we finally opened in October. That was a long September.\n\nThe atmosphere at Hooters in the beginning was very different from what it is now. People didn't know what to expect when they came in, and honestly, we didn't know what to expect day to day.\n\nI remember one time Gil told me we had to let a waitress, Brenda, go because she was wasting too much product. She would grab the paper towels on a spool from the back and drag them all the way through the restaurant if someone asked for a napkin. I was like, \"She's making people laugh. This is what we are, we're fun! Please, don't fire her.\" He didn't.\n\nIt was barely controlled chaos, but it was a blast. That said, we initially weren't generating any revenue. I was pulling double shifts, sometimes three in a row, just to scrape by. We were winging it, doing anything we could to get customers.\n\nThen, around spring break of '84, about six months after opening, it was like a switch. We were suddenly seeing hourslong lines out the door. It was something else. People couldn't get enough. I'd never seen a meteoric rise like that before or since.\n\nHooters' success is largely due to its off-the-wall marketing. Ed was the brains behind a lot of it, willing to do anything and everything to try and get publicity.\n\nWe'd be at the restaurant at 5:30 a.m. to pick up a platter of freshly prepared wings and bring it to the local radio stations for a chance to promote ourselves on the radio. We got a lot of doors shut in our faces, at first.\n\nEd and Brenda — yes, paper towels Brenda — painted \"Hooters\" in bright orange on a capsized boat along the busy Courtney Campbell Causeway connecting Tampa to Clearwater.\n\nEd would even stand outside the restaurant in a chicken suit to try and get people in. We posted a billboard of me in the now-iconic orange shorts and white t-shirt. I also modeled for Playboy, which got us more publicity.\n\nI had no idea that the billboard of me would bloom into what the brand has become. Eventually, it felt like my face was everywhere — on taxis and the side of the semis that brought in our food. It never ceased to thrill me.\n\nAs we grew and expanded, I had more opportunities, such as helping to open new restaurants and contributing to the annual calendar and pageant.\n\nA couple of my favorite moments were when I dropped the flag on the Hooters 500 and when I marched on Washington in 1995, protesting the sex bias case against Hooters.\n\nYes, sex appeal was part of the Hooters concept. However, Hooters and its waitresses are so much more than the restaurant. After 42 years, they've become my family.\n\nThe Hooters Girls are my sisterhood. Some of those women were my bridesmaids and attended the birth of my children. We've been each other's support system through highs and lows, and I still stay in touch with some of them, including Brenda.\n\nI worked as a waitress and guest bartender for Hooters for about seven years until I branched out and took on other roles, including in radio and local TV, where I continued to promote the brand.\n\nLooking back, I hope that I was an integral part of shaping Hooters. I still participate in events, such as judging the annual pageant and selecting the calendar. It has been the ride of my life, besides, of course, being a mom to my four kids.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: More than 150 anonymous channels using cheap AI tools to spread false stories about Keir Starmer, study finds\n\nYouTube channels spreading fake, anti-Labour videos have amassed more than a billion views this year, as opportunists attempt to use AI-generated content to profit from political division in the UK.\n\nMore than 150 channels have been detected in the last year that promote anti-Labour narratives, as well as outright fake and inflammatory accusations about Keir Starmer.\n\nA study seen by the Guardian has found the channels have accumulated 5.3m subscribers and have created more than 56,000 videos, with a total of almost 1.2bn views in 2025. The network of anonymous channels includes alarmist rhetoric, AI scripts and British narrators to attract hits.\n\nStarmer is personally targeted. The prime minister was either named in the video title or description 15,600 times.\n\nReset Tech, the non-profit group that produced the research, said the channels were part of a global trend to produce synthetic propaganda on the platform. It pointed to the proliferation of cheap AI tools that could be deployed to make a quick profit from divisive topics.\n\nOne channel called Britain News-night talked about Starmer and Reeves facing arrest. Another, TheUKPoliticalBrief, touted videos on the “explosive truth” about immigrant crime and marches on Westminster.\n\nThe UK NewsCore channel focused on how Nigel Farage was ousting Starmer, and claimed the prime minister was “sacked live” and thrown out of parliament.\n\nOther videos featured bizarre, fabricated stories about a row between the royal family and the government. One channel, Gold Up!, said the dispute had left Starmer “melting down on live TV”.\n\nSome of the videos and channels were removed by YouTube’s checks. However, all 150 were taken down when the platform was approached by the Guardian. Reset Tech said some channels had created tens or hundreds of similar videos without being deplatformed.\n\nThe research found similar channels operating in German, French, Spanish and Polish, targeting other politicians or political issues. In total, it mapped 420 problematic channels operating in Europe. Reset Tech said Russian-speaking creators operate some of the channels.\n\nIt is believed channels aimed at the UK were being driven by opportunistic creators trying to monetise political division over issues like immigration, rather than overseas political actors. However, it said their presence still posed a risk to public trust.\n\nThe content has caused concern inside Labour. “The rise of fake news online is a serious threat to our democracy,” a spokesperson said. “The public will be rightly alarmed that democratically elected leaders and institutions are being undermined by bad faith foreign state actors and those seeking to profit from misinformation.\n\n“We’ve already seen attempts from overseas to influence fair elections and manipulate public opinion both here and abroad.\n\n“The government is stepping up its efforts to work with online platforms to tackle this scourge on free and fair democracy. But it’s important that tech bosses take this threat seriously and live up to their obligations to remove this type of content wherever it’s found.”\n\nDylan Sparks, UK director of Reset Tech, called for YouTube to take swifter action. “Malicious actors are permitted by YouTube to spread synthetic ‘news’ that disrupts political debate in the UK, while also earning revenue from it,” he said. “This AI-generated, low cost content spreads across the platform undetected, revealing clear weaknesses in YouTube’s monetisation and content moderation systems.\n\n“This specific network focuses on the prime minister and Labour government, but the same loopholes could be exploited by any hostile actor to push an agenda. Because social media platforms profit from engagement, their business model creates an in-built tension between enforcing their own policies and reducing the spread of malicious content that drives revenue.\n\n“The rapid spread of AI has also introduced new risks to the online environment, and platforms need to move faster and invest more to address them.”\n\nA YouTube spokesperson said: “Spam and deceptive practices that try to take advantage of the YouTube community are not allowed on the platform, which is why the channels flagged by the Guardian have all been removed.\n\n“We enforce our policies consistently, regardless of political viewpoint expressed, or how the content is generated. Our teams work around the clock to monitor for harmful content, taking swift action as needed.”\n\nYouTube is now working with Reset Tech over its findings. The platform said its systems prominently feature authoritative news content on the YouTube homepage, in search results, and through recommendations. It has removed more than 2.1m channels for violating its community guidelines.\n\nMinisters have already formed an online advertising taskforce to see what action can be taken to address the advertising-based monetisation of harmful and misleading content.",

The return of Samus is a beautiful exploration adventure that captures what makes the series so special, and why fans have been on the edge of their seats since it was first teased almost a decade ago.\n\nThis latest adventure strands Samus on Viewros, a dead planet in the furthest reaches of space, once occupied by psychic beings, the Lamorn. In their desperate final days, the Lamorn went searching for a savior, and the echoes of their extinct civilization found Samus--their final hope to preserve their knowledge and culture. As Samus treks across Viewros looking for lost artifacts that will help her teleport off-planet, she discovers she isn't alone. The quest becomes a rescue mission for stranded Federation officers, watched by the shadow of the villainous Sylux.\n\nThough Prime 4 has more characters than some past games, it still excels at delivering moody, isolated moments of exploration as you get lost in the cavernous recesses of Viewros. Meanwhile the combat has never been sharper, thanks to a wide variety of control options. It's been a long wait for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, but for Metroid fans, the wait has been worth it. -- Steve Watts\n\nGiven that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has ruled the Switch for years after its release, it only made sense that Mario Kart World would headline the launch of the Switch 2. Kart racing fans were treated to a great sequel with playful additions and fantastic new modes, along with a completely reimagined approach toward track design.\n\nIn Mario Kart World the star of the show is the world itself, connecting tons of familiar Mushroom Kingdom mainstays into one contiguous map that can be driven from one end to the other. You can roam around freely with your friends, but the more important application of this is the design that seamlessly transitions from one track to another as you make your way through the various cups. It's a real treat for Mario Kart fans to see how the world has been reimagined as a single physical space. The new Knockout Tour mode makes great use of the open-world space by turning the race into a tense marathon where players are progressively eliminated after every milestone.\n\nMeanwhile, a smaller roster has been given a full makeover with cartoonish features and a wide variety of outfits, and rounded out with oddball selections like Cow. And Rainbow Road, always the highlight of a new Mario Kart, wows with its impressive scope and variety.\n\nIf there's one fault with Mario Kart World, it's that it can't quite replace the fit and finish that has slowly accumulated on Mario Kart 8 Deluxe over the years. Kart racing fans will likely keep playing both for some time to come, but it's hard to complain about an embarrassment of riches. -- Steve Watts\n\nAvailable on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2\n\nSwitch and Switch 2 are ideal platforms for visual novels and games you keep coming back to--and The Hundred Line, once it gets its hooks into you, is exactly the sort of game you'll be returning to for a long time to come. It starts out as an enjoyable blend of visual novels and tactics games, taking you on a 30-to-40-hour adventure that's sure to appeal to Danganronpa fans. The Hundred Line sees a group of kids taken away to a secret school they must defend from waves of monsters, all under the pretense of defending humanity--though you're initially left without a clear explanation for why this is happening.\n\nThat is all a very good experience, but it's only once you reach the \"end\" of the story that you're introduced to what's the real meat of the experience. The specifics are best left for you to discover yourself, but suffice it to say that ending is only the beginning of a much longer tale: one that causes you to completely rethink the entire experience. It's a bold, big swing from its developer, and one that is truly remarkable--there aren't many other games with a twist that leads you to a far more substantial, interesting game than you thought you were playing.\n\nThe visual novel and turn-based nature of the game lends itself well to being played on a handheld, letting you easily chip away at a bit of progress at a time, but don't be surprised if you find yourself glued to your screen until late in the night as you seek to piece together just what's going on. -- Chris Pereira\n\nAvailable on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2\n\nThough Hades II might have first launched in early access on PC, its full release saw it make the jump to just one other system: the Nintendo Switch. Yet even if Hades II were available on PlayStation and Xbox as well, let's be honest, it just feels right on the pick-up-and-go console. A large part of this is due to Hades II's roguelike nature, which lends itself well to shorter bursts of play and makes it a great choice for commuters or those on the go. That said, I can personally attest to it being a fantastic binge-in-bed game as well.\n\nTo be clear, though, Hades II is a fantastic game wherever you play it. The follow-up to 2019's Hades, Hades II marks the next entry in Supergiant Games' epic reconstruction of Greek mythology. Whereas its predecessor followed Zagreus--son of Hades and Persephone and prince of the Underworld--Hades II follows his younger sister, Melinoe, a young witch who was tragically torn apart from her family as a baby. Following extensive training under Hecate's watchful eyes, Melinoe embarks on a journey to defeat the titan Chronos, reunite with the family she's never known, and restore peace to both the Underworld and Mt. Olympus.\n\nAlong the way, Greek gods and mythological figures alike will opt to either help or hunt Melinoe, who remains relentless and steadfast in her quest regardless of many, many, many times she will ultimately be forced to return to the Crossroads and restart her mission. All of this--accompanied by stylish visuals, spectacular music, plenty of charming and well-acted characters, and compulsive gameplay--make Hades II a must-play title. -- Jessica Cogswell\n\nIf I had to choose one word that best encapsulates Nintendo's Switch era, it would be \"reconstructive.\" Since the original Switch's launch in 2017, Nintendo has seemingly invested in not just making new entries in its biggest series, but redefining what these series are. Donkey Kong is the latest of these properties to receive a dramatic makeover, and the end result is utterly explosive fun.\n\nIn Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo trades in the series' signature 2D-platformer fun for a large-scale, 3D adventure, one in which your main way of interacting with the world is through destroying it. It's endlessly fun, tearing through layer after layer of earth and finding roundabout solutions to the game's various challenges as you do. Chaos, creativity, and an absolutely massive DK pave the way forward in this game, while joyous musical numbers and the delightful Pauline add plenty of charm and tenderness.\n\nNaturally, this Nintendo title is only available on the company's newest console, the Switch 2. And considering the Switch 2's library is fairly limited right now, Donkey Kong Bananza feels like an easy recommendation for those trying to make the most of their shiny new console. However, I have little doubt that it will remain a beloved title throughout the system's life cycle. -- Jessica Cogswell",

She can do so many things on and off the pitch.\"\n\nRusso has now started all 16 Arsenal games this season, and her all-round display against Everton was another reminder of why she has become indispensable for club and country.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool’s season has drifted into uncomfortable territory, a campaign that promised authority now defined by uncertainty. Arne Slot arrived with ideas and conviction, yet results and performances have not matched the expectations that followed last season’s momentum. Anfield Watch have reported on growing unease around Mohamed Salah’s future and the increasing noise linking Liverpool with Real Madrid youngster Arda Guler. It reads like a club standing at a crossroads, unsure whether renewal must be accelerated or merely prepared.\n\nLiverpool were widely tipped as early pace setters, but inconsistency has dulled that edge. The forwards, usually the club’s heartbeat, have faltered. Mohamed Salah’s form has dipped and his frustration has spilled into public view after being benched, creating what can only be described as a destabilising subplot. One source describes how this reaction has fuelled speculation that Salah’s time on Merseyside could end as early as January.\n\nThe Egyptian remains an elite performer, even if recent weeks suggest fatigue or tactical discomfort. His quality, vision, and instinct still define Liverpool’s attacking identity. Yet football moves quickly. Clubs that stand still often fall behind, and the sense grows that contingency planning has already begun.\n\nThat preparation centres on Arda Guler. According to reports, Liverpool are now leading the race to sign the Turkiye international, despite interest from Arsenal and Manchester United. The appeal is clear. Guler is described as a ‘perfect fit’ due to his adaptability within an ever evolving system. Slot is reportedly a ‘fan’ of the 20 year old, while Liverpool’s scouting department are said to be ‘impressed’ by his talent.\n\nGuler’s technical control and spatial awareness speak to a player comfortable between lines, a modern attacker who could thrive in fluid structures. He would not replicate Salah directly, few could, but he represents a different solution to a similar problem, creativity where it has recently gone missing.\n\nLiverpool’s summer spending raised expectations further. Over £200 million invested in Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak was meant to transform attacking output. Instead, Dominik Szoboszlai has emerged as the most consistent contributor, a reminder that solutions do not always come with the largest price tag.\n\nThe lack of goals and invention has defined Liverpool’s struggles. Guler, with his close control and progressive passing, could address both. Whether his arrival depends entirely on Salah’s future remains unclear, but the logic behind the interest is hard to ignore.\n\nThis report lands like a jolt to the system for Liverpool supporters. There is excitement in being linked with a talent like Guler, but also deep concern about what it represents. Seeing Salah’s future openly questioned feels unsettling. He has carried this club through defining moments, and the idea of January rumours turning into reality is genuinely shocking.\n\nThere is scepticism too. Spending heavily on Wirtz and Isak only to still search for creativity feels like an admission that the rebuild has misfired. Fans expected Slot’s methods to elevate the squad, not expose gaps so quickly.\n\nAt the same time, Guler sparks anticipation. Supporters crave invention, someone who can unlock stubborn defences and lift the tempo. The thought of a fearless 20 year old stepping into a side searching for identity is exciting, but also risky. Liverpool are not a development club, they are a pressure cooker.\n\nMost of all, this feels like a moment of truth. Either Salah recommits and the squad recalibrates around him, or Liverpool turn the page faster than anyone expected. Right now, belief is mixed with anxiety, hope edged with disappointment.",

Freshmen David Mirkovic and Keaton Wagler combined for 45 points in the win, while the Illini went 29-of-32 from the line against the Buckeyes. Illinois averages 88.6 points per game and outrebounds opponents by 10.4 rebounds per game to rank 19th nationally in rebounding margin.\n\nNo. 13 Illinois comes into Saturday’s game with an 8-2 record after going on the road to beat Ohio State, 88-80, Tuesday night in its Big Ten opener. The Illini have posted two of the most impressive wins by the Big Ten in non-conference play, as Illinois beat Texas Tech, 81-77, on Nov. 11 and won against Tennessee in Nashville, 75-62, last Saturday. The two losses have come on neutral sites to Alabama and UConn.\n\nDespite losing a pair of first-round picks in the NBA Draft, Illinois returned a trio of starters from a team that won 22 games and reached the second round of last year’s NCAA Tournament.  Brad Underwood is in his ninth year at Illinois after previous coaching stops at Oklahoma State and Stephen F.

    "fullText": "This Sunday’s game between the Chicago Bears (9-4) and the Cleveland Browns (3-10) at Soldier Field is going to test the players, coaches and fans with frigid temperatures potentially dropping below zero.\n\nOne team is fighting for playoff positioning, while the other is using these final regular-season games to end a double-digit loss season on a positive note.\n\nHead coach Ben Johnson said on Wednesday at Halas Hall that his team “desperately” needs to win this week. The Bears are currently the seventh seed in the NFC playoff picture, and a loss only opens up the possibility of the No. 8 seed Detroit Lions (8-5) leapfrogging the Bears for the final Wild Card spot.\n\nHere are five players to watch on Sunday who will have a major impact on this Week 15 game.\n\nThe Bears’ defense gave up far too many explosive plays in last Sunday’s loss to the Green Bay Packers. Kevin Byard III and the Bears’ secondary will have to prove they can limit those 20-plus yard chunk pass plays against a Browns offense that has the third-fewest big completions (28) in the NFL, according to Radar360. Byard mentioned during his Wednesday press conference at Halas Hall that the secondary has to “tighten up with the execution of different coverages.”\n\nOne area that could help Byard and the rest of the defense is playing more effectively on early downs.\n\n“I think looking at the last game, Green Bay was eight-of-12 on third downs, I think seven of those third downs were three and less,” Byard said. “So that means that they were really good on first and second downs. We had to be better on early downs to be able to get guys in the third-and-long because we’re really good on third-and-long. I just think those are a couple things we have to button up. We’re just continuing to get better.”\n\nIn the Browns’ 31-29 loss to the Tennessee Titans last Sunday, Cleveland’s defense gave up 184 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 25 carries. Titans running back Tony Pollard scored both rushing touchdowns and accounted for 161 yards, including a 65-yard touchdown in the first quarter.\n\nThere is no reason why Kyle Monangai shouldn’t have a huge impact on Sunday in the frigid cold. The Bears’ rookie running back ran for 57 yards on 14 carries and ran in a two-point conversion attempt against the Packers last Sunday.\n\nSmall preview of my discussion with Kyle Monangai. \n\nHow does the Bears' running back keep his balance after big hits?\n\n— Nicholas Moreano (@NicholasMoreano) December 11, 2025\n\nIf the Bears’ offensive line continues to reset the line of scrimmage and create rushing lanes, Monangai could be in store for a big game.\n\nAn underlying storyline to follow is how Monangai and Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins perform. Judkins leads all rookie running backs with 784 rushing yards this season, and Monangai is third with his 648 yards.\n\n[READ: Kyle Monangai analyzes his running style in Bears’ NFL Week 14 loss]\n\nMontez Sweat is having a relatively productive season rushing the quarterback. His 8.5 sacks are the 12th most in the NFL. Read more about Sweat’s impact in the in-depth article that Scott Bair wrote for Marquee Sports.\n\n[READ: How Montez Sweat impacted Bears’ winning 2025 season, NFL playoff push]\n\nThe Bears’ defensive end will have a favorable matchup on Sunday with starter Jack Conklin out with a concussion. Former 2024 seventh-round draft pick KT Leveston filled in on the right side in last Sunday’s loss to the Titans, and Leveston allowed four total quarterback pressures and was penalized for holding.\n\nSweat’s career high in sacks is 12.5, and with four regular-season games remaining, he has a chance to break that mark. A well-played game against the Browns would help him to achieve that milestone.\n\nMyles Garrett is on pace and most likely will break the NFL’s single-season sack record by the end of the regular season. The 6-foot-4, 272-pound pass rusher has a career-high 20 sacks and is just three sacks away from breaking Michael Strahan’s and T.J. Watt’s 22 1/2 NFL shared record.\n\ncloser and closer to history for @flash_garrett#TENvsCLE on Fox and NFL+ pic.twitter.com/fpa81LW4cR\n\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 7, 2025\n\nThe Bears must have a sound protection plan so that the single-season sack record isn’t set at Soldier Field. Offensive tackles Ozzy Trapilo and Darnell Wright will both be tested, as Garrett is someone who will line up all over the defense.\n\nHis primary matchup will be against the second-round rookie in Trapilo. According to Pro Football Focus, Garrett has lined up on the defense line’s right side for 521 of his 633 D-line snaps.\n\nThe Browns’ rookie quarterback is coming off his best performance of the season, throwing for 364 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the team’s 31-29 loss to the Titans.\n\nShedur Sanders showed good accuracy throughout the game, especially on his touchdown throw to David Njoku in the second quarter.\n\ndiving grab by the Chief for the TD!#TENvsCLE on Fox and NFL+ pic.twitter.com/vAXy3LajdT\n\n— Cleveland Browns (@Browns) December 7, 2025\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Sanders has excelled at throwing passes behind the line of scrimmage, totaling +5.1 EPA, the sixth-highest mark in the NFL. However, the rookie quarterback has a -17.9 EPA on all other throws, which is the fourth-lowest among quarterbacks.\n\nIf the Bears can minimize the production on some of the shorter route concepts, Chicago’s defense should have success against the Browns’ passing attack.\n\nThe post Kevin Byard III among five players to watch in Bears vs Browns Week 15 game appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",

    "fullText": "AC Milan and Fondazione Milan are coming together once again for the Christmas season through a series of social initiatives aimed at reinforcing the entire Rossoneri family’s commitment to the community and making sports even more accessible and inclusive, which is the primary objective of the Sport for Change project.\n\nThe Sassuolo game at San Siro on Sunday, 14 December 2025, will see San Siro and Casa Milan play host to proof of this commitment. A portion of the revenue from tickets sold during the general sale for the match against the Neroverdi and entrance fees to the Mondo Milan museum will be donated to Fondazione Milan, as will funds raised by around 50 volunteers from the Foundation at the stadium on the day of the game.\n\nThe Club's activities around AC Milan v Sassuolo will go towards the Sport for All programme in effert to support two teams, Briantea84 and Vharese, in the FIGC's DCPS (Paralympic and Experimental Football Division) and Calcio Seduto (Sitting Football) project, which offers children aged 7 to 12, with or without disabilities, the chance to play football in an educational, inclusive and enjoyable environment. The Rossoneri family’s commitment to accessibility and inclusion during this festive period, however, began well before and will continue even after the match at San Siro.\n\nIn recent days, for Fondazione Milan, two Rossoneri players, Samuele Ricci and Pietro Terracciano, helped deliver a minibus to the athletes from the Gruppo Sportivo Non Vedenti Milano Onlus, giving the athletes greater independence in travelling to sporting facilities. During the meeting, which took place at the Milan Institute for the Blind, which has been a partner of the Club for five year, the players enjoyed the Institute’s immersive “Dialogue in the Dark” experience and took part - blindfolded - in a ‘showdown’ match in this sport for blind and visually impaired athletes.\n\nAC Milan players Ardon Jashari and Mike Maignan from the men’s first team, and Monica Renzotti and Nadine Sorelli from the women’s first team, visited the pediatric ward at Milan’s Policlinico hospital, bringing gifts to the young patients. In the coming months, the activity will be repeated in other hospitals across Milan, offering new moments of light-heartedness thanks also to the commitment of the Rossoneri Youth Sector, which actively took part in a gift collection to be distributed throughout the local area.",

    "fullText": "Andrey Santos has hailed Reece James as “fantastic” and revealed he helps everyone at the club when they arrive.\n\nSantos was signed in January 2023 from Brazilian side Vasco da Gama in a deal believed to be worth just £13m, which is looking like a bargain.\n\nThe Brazil international spent 18 months on loan at Strasbourg after a failed spell at Nottingham Forest, and made his long awaited debut at the Club World Cup.\n\nSantos has had to be patient for opportunities, but when he has featured he’s largely impressed, especially in the win against Burnley.\n\nMoises Caicedo’s red card against Arsenal was viewed as the perfect opportunity for Santos, but after starting against Leeds he didn’t play a single minute against Bournemouth or Atalanta.\n\nSantos has been in and out of the side this season.

    "description": "The mail’s here! And, the mailbag is again overflowing.",
    "fullText": "Jeffrey Jacobs asks: Hope you were able to enjoy a Giants-free weekend. I have another Joe Schoen question. Could you give us a peak behind the curtain as to how the Giants divide responsibilities between Schoen and his assistant GM Brandon Brown? What exactly does the Assistant GM do – is he like the Vice President who basically sits around and waits for the President to give him a task, or does he have a specific area of responsibility? While watching the train wreck that was ‘Hard Knocks’ last year, I came away impressed with Brown and have thought that if/when Schoen gets fired the Giants might just promote Brown to the top spot which would insure some level of continuity (arguably that might not be as good thing, but that’s a whole other question). I do feel that Joe Schoen needs to go, with his biggest failure being an almost criminal lack of depth on the roster – as soon as a starter goes down, that unit is basically doomed.\n\nEd says: Jeffrey, I don’t know the nitty-gritty details of what Brown does every day. I know that when Schoen was hired by the Giants he credited Buffalo Bills GM Brandon Beane with preparing him for the job by letting him on every aspect of it, not hiding any information from him or keeping him from learning every piece of the GM role. He promised to do the same for Brown.\n\nWhen he was hired, Brown described his job this way:\n\nWith the Giants, Brown described his job in two words: “football solutions.”\n\n“It’s overseeing the pro personnel department, the college scouting department and also just being the checks and balances with Joe on the football operations side,” Brown said.\n\nBrown takes part in all of the major decision-making discussions. He makes a lot of scouting trips, sometimes with Schoen and sometimes without him. He has a voice in everything, he just doesn’t get to make any of the final decisions.\n\nDennis Norton asks: If the decision is made to replace Joe Schoen, why not Brandon Brown? Brown has interviewed for other GM positions in the past and is seen as an up and comer. Brown’s elevation would not disrupt the this year’s scouting process and would provide for an easier transition to a new regime. I realize the argument against Brown is that he may be part of the problem. However, his experience as Assistant GM and time spent with the Eagles lead me to believe that his time has come. Elevate him and let him be part of the process to hire a new Coach. Your thoughts?\n\nEd says: Dennis, that is a natural question. Brown has gotten some interviews for other general manager openings.\n\nYou actually, though, answered your own question. We don’t know how much influence Brown has had on many of the biggest decisions that have been made the past few years. What has he agreed with? What has he not agreed with? What would he have done differently? Maybe ownership knows the answer because Brown does have a voice in the organization and is involved.\n\nIf ownership feels Brown would have made some different decisions in the past, and is better-suited to be the decision-maker going forward, fine. But, we can’t know for sure he is or isn’t “part of the problem,” to use your words.\n\nJohn Fritz asks: My question is with JS future uncertain with the Giants if there are or aren’t any moves during their bye week be it player extensions or any additions, would that tip where ownership is leaning?\n\nEd says: John, I don’t think anything that did or did not happen during the bye week gives us any insight. I think that what happens over the final four weeks, when the Giants don’t play a single team that has a winning record, will be something that might weigh into ownership’s thinking. Especially if the Giants don’t win a couple of those games.\n\nGino P. asks: You explained well why the hit on Olszewski was not a helmet to helmet penalty.  My question is if that WAS called a penalty, would that override the turnover?  I have not seen that situation arise in a game before.\n\nEd says: This is a good question. As I often do with rules questions, I turned to Cyd Ziegler of Outsports.com for clarification. Cyd has refereed games at the high school and college levels.\n\n“Yes, the offense keeps the ball. The offense may need to accept the penalty – which they obviously would – and the enforcement spot would be the spot of the foul, given it was during a “running play.” I’m not sure there’s a specific “if the fumble is caused by a foul the fouled team keeps it,” but if you think about it, a foul before the change of possession… everything that happens after that foul is moot as long as the penalty is accepted.”\n\nSo, had a penalty been called the Giants would have maintained possession.\n\nRobert Forgione asks: How much can Schoen and the ownership “search” for a new coach as the season is still going on. I thought you could only talk to coaches that were eliminated from playoffs or on a bye? What exactly are they doing if not able to talk to potential coaches.\n\nEd says: Robert, interviews with candidates already employed by other teams cannot be conducted until after the season or during designated windows during the playoffs. That is correct. That doesn’t mean back-channel calls to intermediaries, like agents, can’t be made to get an idea who might or might not be interested in the job. It also doesn’t mean some vetting of people you might have interest in can’t occur.\n\nEdward McGowan asks: In listening and watching the Giants’ games this year, I heard a lot about how Dexter Lawrence has faced a double team in over 70% of the plays he has been involved with. I never gave it much thought. Then, I watched how Steve Spagnuolo schemed to get Chris Jones single covered and basically take over the second half of the game for the Kansas City Chiefs. OK, the Chiefs didn’t win but Jones was dominant. Is this a failure of the defensive coordinator? Standing by and letting the other team take away your best defensive player or did Bowen think this was a good use of Lawrence. I know Dexter was much better last year and he was probably double-teamed just as much, but it seems to me this is a clear indictment of Bowen’s inability to leverage the pieces of his defense. I know he’s gone, but Monday night made me resent him all over again.\n\nCan we expect to see any changes in scheme that might light a spark on the defensive side or it too late in the season to change what has been baked into Bowen’s defensive strategy?\n\nEd says: Edward, the only thing I can say is I guess we will find out over the next four weeks. Interim defensive coordinator Charlie Bullen can’t throw everything out and install a new scheme. He can turn to some unused pages in the playbook and call things differently than Bowen did. He showed a willingness to do that against the Patriots, dialing up some blitz packages and efforts to disguise coverages or who was/was not rushing that we did not see from Bowen.\n\nCan he create more one-on-one opportunities for Lawrence? It will certainly help if Kayvon Thibodeaux comes back and Abdul Carter starts making the kind of plays he was drafted to make. Those developments might force offense to make more decisions about allocating blocking resources.\n\nOne thing about Chris Jones is that he is much smaller than Lawrence, which gives the Chiefs the ability to align him in more places than the Giants can align Lawrence. Kansas City has used Jones as an edge or defensive end more than 200 times this season. I don’t think you can do that with a 350-pound man.\n\nChristopher Trappe asks: Given your journalistic experience covering the Giants, your proximity to the team and your knowledge of Giants operations, do you think the 2025 Giants are better than last year’s team?\n\nEd says: Christopher, I think they should have been better. I think the pieces were, and in many ways still are, there for them to be better. I think all the blown double-digit leads they have blown tell you the opportunity was there for them to be better.\n\nI think, though, that Jermaine Eluemunor’s answer to this question was the right one.\n\n“2-11 sucks, period. I’m not going to look at this record and be like, yeah, we’re 2-11 now, we’re 2-11 last year but it’s different. No, it’s not different. It’s the same. We’re 2-11,” Eluemunor said earlier this week. “Like, you did things last year that got you to 2-11. We did things this year that got us to 2-11. I can say that our play is different. We’re in close games, but we didn’t finish those games. I’m not the type of cherry-pick at things and look at the positives. I’m a positive guy by nature, but at the same time we are 2-11 still. So, obviously there’s a lot of things for us to improve as a team and me individually, but there’s no cherry-picking at the record. I feel like that’s kind of like a losing mentality to be like, oh yeah, let’s look at this, look at that. No, we’re 2-11.”\n\nDon Barone asks: Just want to get your opinion on the head coach search. Many are saying two things I disagree with. One, that it needs to be an offensive minded coach to develop Jaxon Dart. Two that Dart or any other player should have a big say on who the choice should be. I couldn’t disagree more. I think it should be a CEO type to oversee the entire operation. Discipline and structure top my list. Let the OC and QB coach develop Dart. Two, the inmates are already running the asylum.  Please let the qualified people within the front office and ownership make the right choice. I get it that they’re hard to trust but they are more qualified than a 22-year-old player who’s been with the team for nine months.\n\nEd says: Don, where did this idea come from that Jaxson Dart is going to get to pick his next head coach? I know that isn’t fully what you are saying, but it seems to be what some fans think.\n\nDart has been an NFL player for less than a year. He has won TWO games. In no way is he picking the next head coach. Now, how the next head coach fits with Dart, whether or not he is all-in on Dart as the guy to build around, what his plan is for developing Dart and running an offense with him at the center of it, is critically important. Dart is the biggest piece of the Giants’ puzzle.\n\nFinding the right head coach is not about which side of the ball he comes from. It is about whether he can lead men. Can he put a structure in place and hold players to a standard? Does he understand the kind of football the Giants have always won with? Can he excite quality assistant coaches and get them to come work for him?\n\nEd Helinski asks: What should Santa bring the Giants this Christmas? And who might be in line for coal in their stocking?\n\nEd says: Ed, it will be a late Christmas present but the Giants should hope Santa brings them the right head coach. Oh, and good health news for John Mara.\n\nCoal in their stocking? The easy answer is Eagles fans.\n\nRoger Mazone asks: Giant 2026 Draft Needs?\n\nThe Giants have many holes to fill going into next season, many of these needs outside of the quarterback position, are the same needs the Giants had last year. On defense, a defensive tackle to aid Dexter Lawerence to help the run defense, more athletic inside linebackers for the same purpose, and help on the backend with a topflight cornerback.\n\nOn offense we need a 1B/2 WR (not sure how effective Nabers will be coming off a major injury especially early next season) and an interior offensive lineman/guard to compete with Van Roten. Also, the Giants need a new placekicker for the 2026 season.\n\nObviously, some of these needs can be met on the free agent market, but the GM hasn’t had a stellar record with free agent acquisitions on defense.\n\nWhat positions would you prioritize in the draft based on this large requirement list?\n\nEd says: Roger, I think it is too early to set priorities in any type of order.\n\nIt is apparent that on offense the Giants are likely to need wide receiver and interior offensive line help. They might need tackle help, too, if they decide not to pay Jermaine Eluemunor.\n\nOn defense, they need help everywhere except edge. Defensive line, off-ball linebacker, cornerback, safety if the right one is available.\n\nAll of this, though, is putting the cart before the horse. We don’t know who the coach will be. We don’t know if there will be a new GM. Thus, we don’t know what the decision-makers will think of the existing roster, and how deeply they will cut into it.\n\nAlso, as you said, free agency comes first. The priorities will shift based on what happens in that market.\n\nJason Brown asks: I notice that some players may be considered a ‘bust’ while with one team, then thrive on another team after the original team moves on from them. Is it the fault of coaches on the original team for not being able to tap into the player’s ability or is it really change of scenery in some cases? I’m asking this in the event the Giants move on from Evan Neal and somehow he does well in his eventual landing spot.\n\nEd says: Jason, there is no one size fits all answer to that question. It might be coaching. It might be that a player is just not a fit and does not feel comfortable with a certain team or in a location. Sometimes, a coaching change leads to a player not fitting with the new staff. Sometimes, it is on the player for faulty work habits or lack of maturity. Sometimes a guy accepts a position change to keep his career going in a new location that he might not have been willing to accept from his original team.\n\nI can tell you the Giants are aware they could end up with egg on their faces if Neal goes somewhere else and plays well. But, they tried to make it work for almost four years in New York and it just didn’t.\n\nKen Moskowitz asks: Ed, I’ve been a die hard Giants fan for over 50 years. If a team does not provide the supporting cast around the QB, it doesn’t matter who is back there. Daniel Jones never had the support from both coaching and personnel to give him a chance to be successful. The decision to keep Daboll after he treated Daniel Jokes the way he did shows a lack of leadership by both ownership and the GM. This organization has taken a turn in the wrong direction from all levels. What is your thoughts as to what really needs to happen to get them back on track?\n\nEd says: Ken, I hate to oversimplify this but they need the right coach. They need a guy who is going to set an standard, hold players accountable, build a clear identity and be there for 8-10 years to establish some consistency.\n\nWhen you keep changing … and changing … and changing some more you don’t get where you want to go. You just keep going back to the beginning and starting over.\n\nLawrence Kenney asks: I’ve continued to read the commentary about changing Dart’s style of play, but I’m of the opinion that there’s only so much that can be done in season\n\nDuring the offseason, whoever is coach should mandate that Dart watch tape of Patrick Mahomes. He is, arguably, the best quarterback in the league and has a tremendous talent for knowing when to slide and/or step out of bounds without significant contact.\n\nEd says: Lawrence, if you have listened to Dart speak he is already well aware of Mahomes’ play style. He has already spent considerable time studying Mahomes and other top quarterbacks.\n\nI worry about Dart’s future, but I quite honestly think that the narrative around him has jumped the shark and is really becoming a lot of noise. Yes, everybody would like to see him choose to protect himself a little more often. But, do you want all the constant headlines and chipring about his play style to change who he is, to make him hesitant, to take away the competitiveness and play-making ability that can make him special?\n\nHe is a 22-year-old kid. He will learn. As his career moves along, he will run less often. He will gain more understanding of what plays he can and cannot make. Hopefully, the Giants will also continue to build around him so he doesn’t feel he needs to do so much by himself.\n\nChris Butters asks: I think we can all agree the season is over, and Kafka probably isn’t getting the H/C gig.\n\nIn your opinion is there now some merit to giving rookie/2nd year players some game time to see what we’ve got? I was thinking about Mbow and Alexander specifically.\n\nEd says: Chris, this “play the young players” stuff is a typical narrative at the end of a losing season. Tell me, though, aside from Marcus Mbow what young player who should be playing is not already getting significant snaps?\n\nThe quarterback is a rookie. Darius Alexander, a third-round pick, sees significant snaps most weeks. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo are hurt. John Michael Schmitz, Tyrone Tracy, Abdul Carter, Cor’Dale Flott, Tyler Nubin, Deonte Banks, Dane Belton, Dru Phillips, and Korie Black are all getting a lot of playing time. Micah McFadden and Darius Muasau are hurt.\n\nAs for Mbow, that is a tricky one. Jermaine Eluemunor is having an outstanding season. If you bench him now to “see what you have” in Mbow, I can almost guarantee that Eluemunor will sign elsewhere in the offseason. If that is the outcome you want, fine. But, you have to understand that. Eluemunor is a proud man who has fought through a lot to become a very good NFL right tackle. If you insult him, there will be plenty of other teams happy to have him at right tackle.\n\nCan Mbow play guard? Maybe in the long term, but I have no idea if he has being taking guard reps in practice. He is small for a guard, just 300 pounds, and the reality that his play strength was a question even before the draft indicates he would need to add bulk and strength to play in there.\n\nSo, again, what young players aren’t already getting significant opportunities?\n\nDouglas Furth asks: If Phillip Rivers is not on the Hall of Fame ballot this year, does that improve Eli’s chances?\n\nEd says: Douglas, I wish I believed it did. No one will ever convince me that Eli Manning does not belong in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. If the playoffs and Super Bowl are more important than the regular season, which they are, what Manning did when given an opportunity in the postseason must be weighted more heavily than perceived regular season mediocrity.\n\nI don’t think that Rivers, if he ends up on the Indianapolis Colts’ 53-man roster, being off the ballot is going to matter. Drew Brees is on the ballot, and I can almost guarantee Brees will get more support than Manning. With the limited number of players enshrined each year (four to eight) I seriously doubt two quarterbacks would be voted in.\n\nRonald Buchheim asks: Koo claimed the ball was wobbling so he pulled up and didn’t kick. Let’s disregard the fact that the ball was ultimately stable after wobbling slightly. Why didn’t this highly experienced professional attempt the kick regardless of the ball’s motion? Doesn’t he understand that a poor kick is better than no kick at all? Isn’t he coached on what to do in this common situation? Did anyone ask him or his coach about this? Is it another reason, along with the other special team failures last week, to fire yet another coach?\n\nEd says: Ronald, if you watch the play back you clearly see that the hold by Jamie Gillan was not clean.\n\nYounghoe Koo 😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/09zQTT2CMf\n\n— Kenny Powers (@k3nnyp0w3rs) December 2, 2025\n\nNow, should Younghoe Koo followed through and kicked the ball, anyway? Probably. It looked ridiculous and Gillan ended up with a knee injury that to the end result.\n\nNow, as far as firing Michael Ghobrial I do hope you have calmed down since you sent this question. The Giants special teams have, for the most part been really good this season. The placekicker issue is not on Ghobrial, and the Week 13 game was not good overall.\n\nAll NFL teams absolutely practice what to do in situations like this. There are several things that could happen. Ghobrial addressed the play with Koo this week. Here is what he said\n\n“It doesn’t happen very often, but you do see missed snaps, you do see missed holds, and sometimes there’s just a variety of different outcomes when it comes to that. Sometimes the kicker sees that the ball is replaced and is able to kick through it. Sometimes they kick through it and it hits the o-linemen in the back of the head because it’s not placed the proper way. Sometimes there’s a fire drill where they’re obviously trying to just throw the pass and sometimes guys just dirt the ball. So, it does happen.”\n\nBob Conyea asks: How important do you feel it is for the next Giants head coach to have prior head coaching experience? The coordinator route seems to be very hit and miss. Some of these guys are great with the x’s and o’s but they lack the ability to run the whole program and often show little interest or ability with the “other side of the ball” (Daboll). In military parlance, good staff officers don’t necessarily make good commanders. Isn’t that ability perhaps one of the more important traits that Mike Kafka must demonstrate in his stint as interim head coach? The Giants need a leader more than they need a thinker.\n\nEd says: Bob, I fully agree that leadership — the ability to get dozens of well-paid men with fairly substantial egos to buy in to your message, to be accountable and toe the line of the standard you set, is more important than ability to scheme offense or defense.\n\nIt might be easier to know if a veteran coach does or does not have that ability. It does not, though, mean a first-time coach can’t have it. Bill Parcells had it. Dan Campbell has it. Sean McVay has it.\n\nBoth avenues can be hit and miss. To me, though, the leadership aspect is more important than the Xs and Os aspect.\n\nHave a Giants-related question?

    "description": "ESPN believes Vance Joseph and Davis Webb could leave the Broncos as a package deal, one as HC and one as OC.",
    "fullText": "Denver Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph is widely considered one of the top head coach candidates for the 2026 hiring cycle, and he might not be the only coach Denver could lose in the offseason.\n\nDavis Webb, Denver's offensive pass game coordinator/quarterbacks coach, is also expected to draw interest from other clubs in 2026 (and he could be a head coach candidate himself someday down the road). Earlier this week, ESPN insiders Jeremy Fowler and Dan Graziano speculated that Joseph and Webb could leave as a package deal in 2026.\n\nFrom their ESPN.com story published on Wednesday:\n\nWe talked about Vance Joseph's head coach candidacy earlier, and a defensive-minded head coach candidate is always going to have to sell a team on his choice of offensive coordinator. To that end, keep an eye on Broncos QBs coach Davis Webb, who's viewed as a strong coaching prospect in many circles and could be a candidate to go with Joseph as offensive coordinator if Joseph gets a head coach job this cycle.\n\nFowler and Graziano later seemed to hint that Joseph and Webb could be a potential fit for the New York Giants, who will be seeking a new head coach in 2026 after firing Brian Daboll.\n\nFor now, Joseph and Webb are focused on Denver's 2025 campaign, but it's possible that this could be their final season with the Broncos. Sean Payton lost three coaches to other clubs last offseason, and it appears that trend might continue in 2026.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Broncos could lose Vance Joseph and Davis Webb to same team",

Detroit heads west needing a win to stay in the playoff hunt. They are currently at #8, one spot out of the show. The Rams are tied atop the NFC West but hold a tenuous percentage points lead. A win lets them keep it for next week’s Thursday Night Football first place battle with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nDating back to 1937, the Rams and Lions have a storied history. Through iterations in Cleveland, Los Angeles, Anaheim, St Louis, and back to Los Angeles, the Rams hold a slim 45-43-1 overall lead in the series.

Since Sean McVay took over in 2017, it’s been a 2-2 wash.\n\nOn the injury front, the Rams have listed WR Davante Adams (hamstring) as questionable, but Sean McVay seems optimistic he’ll be ready to go. The Lions have seven players with a questionable designation. Offensive linemen Taylor Decker (shoulder), Christian Mahogany (fibula), and Kayode Awosika (foot), safety Thomas Harper (concussion), tight end Shane Zylstra (knee), wide receiver/returner Kalif Raymond (ankle), and running back Sione Vaki (thumb).

    "fullText": "Mid-table Brentford face a resurgent Leeds side, who have won four points in their past two matches against Chelsea and Liverpool. BBC Sport looks at some of the key themes ahead of Sunday's match.\n\nBrentford have won just one of their four Premier League games against Leeds and will be looking to avoid three straight defeats in the Premier League for the first time since February 2024, after losses to Arsenal and Tottenham.\n\nIt was more away day pain for Keith Andrews' side last week in north London as they gave a toothless display at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The Bees had just four shots in the match, with one on target and a measly xG of 0.29.\n\nWhile their mid-table figure of 21 Premier League goals for the season doesn't ring immediate alarm bells, the spread of those goals may be a cause of concern. Striker Igor Thiago has scored over half - and five of his 11 have been from the penalty spot.\n\nRecord signing Dango Ouattara has won four of those penalties, more than any other player in Europe's top five leagues. This game will be Ouattara's last appearance before leaving to represent Burkina Faso at the Africa Cup of Nations. Brentford will need the likes of Mikel Damsgaard and Kevin Schade to fill this creative void. As it stands, veteran midfielder Jordan Henderson leads the way at the club for Premier League assists, with three.\n\nLeeds had lost four straight Premier League games going into their midweek fixture against Chelsea last week, using a 4-3-3 formation. But for the second half against Manchester City in the final fixture of those four defeats, Farke deviated from his usual four at the back to try a 3-5-2.\n\nDespite being pipped 3-2 by Pep Guardiola's side, the performance was encouraging and Farke has since started his side in a 3-5-2 in subsequent fixtures against Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nThe results have been stark, with four points from two matches against established heavyweight sides and three goals scored in each. It is as many times as Leeds had scored three in the Premier League across their previous 37 games.\n\nBrentford have had mixed fortunes facing the formation. They have won just twice in the seven games they have played in the Premier League against sides using a 3-5-2.",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Rams don't have time to think about the 2026 NFL Draft just yet, but they will be in a few months. L.A. currently has two first-round picks thanks to the team's 2025 trade with the Atlanta Falcons, and could be picking in the top-10 depending on how the rest of the season pans out.\n\nIn FOX Sports draft expert Rob Rang's latest mock draft, the Rams go all offense with their first two picks. Rang predicts L.A. takes Utah offensive tackle Spencer Fano with the Falcons' pick and then comes back around with an offensive weapon at the end of the first round with Washington receiver Denzel Boston.\n\nOne of the few areas of concern for the Rams is at right tackle, where Warren McClendon has struggled with inconsistency. The 6-foot-6, 309 pound Fano is surprisingly agile with NFL bloodlines and experience playing both tackle spots.\n\nThere are a lot of gifted receiver tandems in the NFL, but few can match the Rams’ Puka Nacua and Davante Adams’ production. Both, however, have struggled with durability, which could leave Les Snead valuing Boston's similar combination of size and ball skills. With an extra first-round pick to play with, Snead might view adding yet another gifted pass-catcher for Matthew Stafford to target as a cheap and savvy insurance policy.\n\nThe picks make sense on its surface, but both would be luxury selections for the Rams.\n\nMcClendon has been playing like one of the better linemen recently in place of the injured Rob Havenstein. If he finishes strong, the Rams may not need to look at linemen early in the 2026 draft.\n\nMeanwhile, Boston doesn't fill an obvious need for L.A. Nacua will be around for a while and Adams sounds like he'll stick around as long as Stafford is on the team. The Rams have a solid depth of players behind both Jordan Whittington and Konata Mumpfield, so adding Boston now wouldn't give any of the backup receivers a chance to develop.\n\nBoston has been great for Washington over the past two years, though. The 6-foot-4, 209-pounder caught 119 receptions for 1,589 yards and 19 touchdowns over his past 24 games. Drafting him would be a future-looking move for a Rams team looking to maximize it's Super Bowl contention window.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: 2026 NFL mock draft: Rams upgrade offense in first round",

    "fullText": "Edwin Díaz was introduced at Dodger Stadium in a brief press conference on Friday afternoon, and will wear number three with the Dodgers. He’s previously only worn 39 in his major league career, but that number is retired in Los Angeles for catcher Roy Campanella. Díaz said he chose three in part because he and his wife have three kids.\n\n“I chose the Dodgers because they are a winning organization,” Díaz said on Friday. “I’m looking to win, and I think they have everything to win.”\n\nIn his analysis this week of the Díaz signing, Michael Baumann at FanGraphs wrote, “The Dodgers know better than anyone that Díaz is not a sure thing. But, like, he’s about as close as you can get.”\n\nFrom R.J. Anderson at CBS Sports: “No one is going to feel bad for Roberts, who just won his third World Series title as a manager, but his job should be a lot easier next season now that he has an obvious ninth-inning answer at his disposal in Edwin Díaz. … Weird things can happen with relievers — even those as good as Díaz — but Roberts shouldn’t have to do as much stressing about the game’s final outs heading forward.”\n\nSpeaking of Dave Roberts, the $8.1 million average annual salary of his contract that which runs through 2029 makes him the highest-paid manager in the sport, but Jeff Passan at ESPN points out that that’s still less than half of top head coaches in the NFL and NBA, and that many new managers hired this winter are only making around $1 million.\n\nRoberts in an interview with Japanese media revealed that Shohei Ohtani in 2024 made a “very, very big contribution” to help the mother of former Dodgers reliever Gus Varland get treatment for cancer. Anthony Solorzano at the Los Angeles Times has more, including the good news that Varland’s mother is now cancer free.\n\nThe Dodgers and Blue Jays met in the World Series, and have made and are poised to make impactful deals this offseason, too, writes Alden González at ESPN. Among the Dodgers’ interests reported by González was a Kiké Hernández return, plus trade targets Steven Kwan and Brendan Donovan.\n\nBrett Pill, who was a Dodgers minor league hitting coach and coordinator for the last six seasons, was hired Friday by the Colorado Rockies as their major league hitting coach.",

    "description": "JMU coach Bob Chesney will get a taste of Big Ten football in playoff game before he takes over the UCLA program next season.",
    "fullText": "James Madison head coach Bob Chesney has been successful wherever he's coached, culminating in a College Football Playoff appearance where he will take his Dukes team into Autzen to face the Oregon Ducks.\n\nThis will be first trip of two to Eugene for Chesney as he is set to take over UCLA next season, and the Bruins are scheduled to come to Oregon in 2026. Chesney has coached at Division III Salve Regina in Rhode Island, Division II Assumption, Holy Cross in the Patriot League and James Madison before heading to the bright lights of Los Angeles.\n\nIt's going to be a big change for Chesney, but in his UCLA introductory press conference, Chesney said he's ready for the challenge.\n\n“Success looks like winning. That’s what it looks like on a day-to-day basis,\" he said. \"For us, it is what we do in this program. Every single thing we do has winners and losers every single day. There will not be a day that goes by that we just kind of get by. That’s, I think, really important. And that was, I think, the underlying theme in everything we’ve done up to this point in time. We don’t walk on the field on Saturdays, not having been there before, in almost every situational aspect you can imagine. Pressure on music playing at practice, right behind the quarterbacks. Those are all things that we have to do to prepare ourselves for game day.\"\n\nUCLA has had much success of late, and that job is going to be a challenge, especially with USC right next door and playing in the Big Ten as a whole. Chesney will be the Bruins' fourth head coach in four seasons after Chip Kelly left after the 2023 season. They then hired DeShaun Foster before firing him in the middle of last season and letting Tim Skipper finish out the 2025 campaign.\n\nIt's not difficult to figure out why UCLA hired Chesney. He is 132-51 overall, including 23-9 at Salve Regina, 44-16 at Assumption with three playoff appearances, 44-21 at Holy Cross, and finally 21-5 in his two seasons at James Madison.\n\nTo UCLA's credit, they are allowing Chesney to coach JMU in the 2025 playoffs. The Bruins could have easily said no, but unlike in other situations, such as Ole Miss, Bruin Athletic Director Martin Jarmond sees things a little differently.\n\n“It was easy for me. You want to attract someone that’s loyal, and that’s committed, and that has a purpose,\" Jarmond said. That aligns with our true Bruin values. To have someone that will leave in that kind of situation, that you’re doing something special, when you sat in those young men’s homes and said we’re going to compete and win a championship. I didn’t feel that was right. I want a guy that will want to stay with his team, and we were going to support that.\"\n\nOregon hopes Chesney's time at James Madison is about to run out and make him the full-time UCLA coach sooner rather than later with a home playoff win on Saturday, Dec. 20.\n\nContact/Follow @Ducks_Wire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oregon Ducks news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Ducks Wire: JMU coach Bob Chesney gets Big Ten preview with playoff game vs Ducks",

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace can move to within two points of Manchester City when the sides meet this weekend. BBC Sport examines some of the key themes before Sunday's match.\n\nPalace have never beaten Pep Guardiola's City at Selhurst Park but they did come out on top in last season's FA Cup final, claiming their first major trophy courtesy of a 1-0 win.\n\nThe Eagles only had 22% possession in the final but were able to stifle City's attack while remaining a threat on the counter. That's been a strategy regularly employed by boss Oliver Glasner – 17 of Palace's last 20 league wins have come in matches where they have had under 50% possession.\n\nThe Londoners, who claimed a comfortable Conference League win at Shelbourne on Thursday, have started the season impressively. They already have 26 points, which is twice as many as at this stage last year and their highest figure after 15 Premier League games.\n\nHowever, the festive period could prove a testing one for Palace's relatively shallow squad. Ismaila Sarr, their second highest scorer this term, is expected to report for Africa Cup of Nations duty with Senegal next week, providing he overcomes a recent injury.\n\nTo make matters worse, wing-back Daniel Munoz, who was outstanding against City at Wembley, will be out for at least four weeks following knee surgery.\n\nCity win again but Guardiola demands more\n\nManchester City made it four wins in a row – and eight victories from their past 10 games – by beating Real Madrid on Wednesday, but Guardiola was quick to bring his side back down to earth.\n\nHe insisted City have produced better performances at the Bernabeu without winning, adding \"that level is not quite enough\" for success in the latter stages of the Champions League.\n\nThe Spaniard was also the party pooper after last weekend's 3-0 victory over Sunderland. Summer signing Rayan Cherki starred in that game, assisting two goals, but Guardiola appeared unimpressed by the Frenchman's rabona cross for City's third.\n\n\"I want players to do the simple things well,\" the manager said afterwards, pointedly noting he has never seen Lionel Messi attempt a rabona.\n\nGuardiola is hardly known for simplicity in team selection, with his penchant for rotation – and so-called 'Pep Roulette' – a familiar frustration for fantasy football managers.\n\nYet this season, the 54-year-old has relied on continuity more than in the past. Wednesday's win in Madrid was the fifth time he has named an unchanged starting line-up in the current campaign. Before 2025-26, he had never done so more than twice in a season with City.",

But Gabby had been out for more than 300 days, so it’s such a long journey for him to get back.\n\n“But what was great was how well he did when he came on. He made an impact straight away, he almost scored and it’s brilliant to have him back because he’s a great player and a great guy.\n\n“He’s done so much for us and everyone knows he has unbelievable quality so he’s going to help us a lot.”\n\nJesus had played in friendly matches behind closed doors before Wednesday, so it wasn’t the very first time he’d been involved in a game since his injury.\n\nBut it’s a different story to step out onto the pitch in a match that means something, and to prove you can still have an impact in such a fixture.\n\nIt’s understandable that meant a lot to Jesus, as he showed he’s still an important member of the Arsenal squad. The Gunners have had to deal with not having him for the last 11 months, but he’s clearly not just here to build up his fitness for a transfer. He’s ready to play.",

    "description": "It is setting up to be a very interesting offseason for the Cleveland Browns, who have to decide whether or not to stick with Shedeur Sanders or draft another quarterback. One CBS Sports analyst weighed in in his latest mock draft.",
    "fullText": "Browns predicted to ditch Shedeur Sanders for 24-TD mobile quarterback in 2026 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThings have gotten more interesting at the quarterback position for the Cleveland Browns in recent weeks.\n\nThat's because Shedeur Sanders has been playing at an impressive level for a rookie since getting the starting job following Dillon Gabriel's injury, and so much so that the Browns have declared him as the starter the rest of the season.\n\nThat was the right move by the Browns, as it's quite clear Sanders has been playing much better than Gabriel was over his six starts and deserves a longer look.\n\nIf Sanders can keep this up, the Browns will have to decide if what will be a seven-start sample size is enough to move forward with Shedeur or if they're going to use one of their most valuable picks on another quarterback in 2026.\n\nCBS Sports' Josh Edwards sees the latter happening.\n\nIn his latest mock draft, Edwards has the Browns taking Oregon quarterback Dante Moore with the No. 4 overall selection, which would essentially mean the Browns aren't moving forward with the Colorado product.\n\nDante Moore started as a true freshman at UCLA, so while it is true that he has been on an Oregon team with superior athletes to its opponents, that is not the full picture. Also, in a lesser discussed narrative, Moore was born in East Cleveland. There has been a lot of talk about him returning to Eugene for another season, but it would be tough to deny top-5 overall money after offensive coordinator Will Stein left to take the head coaching job at Kentucky. The door is open for Shedeur Sanders to earn an extended look as well, but the sample size is small thus far.\n\nMoore is having another strong season, completing 72.5% of his passes for 2,733 yards and 24 touchdowns to six interceptions, which has led many to believe he's worked his way into the conversation as one of the top quarterback prospects, although he isn't a lock to come out of college.\n\nThe Draft Network describes Moore as a \"mobile quarterback who has good velocity on throws with accuracy to all three levels of the field.\"\n\nTDN is concerned about Moore's arm strength because he \"loses some velocity on throws that are deeper down the field,\" and the outlet also points to Moore's \"mechanics under pressure\" as another area that needs work.\n\nOutside of some legendary performances over the final four weeks of the year, we find it very hard to believe the Browns will pass up on a quarterback they love in next year's draft in favor of sticking with Sanders.\n\nIf that's the case and the Browns draft a quarterback following a strong finish to his season, Sanders is almost certainly going to be unhappy about that and then we'd have to start wondering if a trade might be in his future.\n\nWhat Shedeur does have going for him is that next year's draft class isn't great for the quarterback position, so it's possible Cleveland just doesn't take one because they aren't thrilled with the options when they're on the clock.\n\nThere are so many layers to this that makes it one of the most interesting situations in the NFL once we get to the offseason.\n\nWhat Cleveland does at the quarterback position is going to be one of the more interesting story lines this offseason, and that's before mentioning the Shedeur angle in all this.\n\nHow Panthers can clinch NFC South title over Bucs as soon as Week 16\n\nExtent of T.J.

    "fullText": "Real Madrid manager Xabi Alonso will have been well aware that he was in for a difficult press conference on Saturday before his side head to face Alaves on Sunday night. Much of the conversation in the Spanish capital is centred on his future at the club.\n\nLos Blancos face a run of Alaves at Mendizorrotza, Talavera de la Reina in the Copa del Rey, and Sevilla to close out the year. The latest is that if Real Madrid do not come away with three wins from those games, Alonso could be dismissed before 2026.\n\nThe Basque manager was asked directly if he felt his job was on the line on Sunday night.\n\n“I always tell you that for me, the most important thing is the team and the club. Obviously, tomorrow we have a very important match because of the current situation. We want to change our run of results. We have a demanding opponent, and that’s what’s at stake tomorrow.”\n\nFollowing their 2-1 defeat to Manchester City, Alonso had praised his side, commenting that he had ‘nothing to reproach them for’. However this of course drew the question of whether he was content with a loss.\n\n“No, none of that. We did a lot of things well. We analysed what happened in the post-match press conference. It’s over now, but we have positive things to take away that we’ll need in the future. And the very near future is tomorrow.”\n\nAs the press searched for sort of avenue with which to advance and find out more about how Alonso was handling things, he was asked if he had found the Real Madrid that he had expected.\n\n“I’ve been in football for many years. Nothing that happens surprises me. These are normal things, things that have happened, things that will happen in the future. We have to face them with the responsibility that comes with the position and what we represent. From there, it’s time to work to turn the situation around. It’s not something that surprises me too much.”\n\nIn recent weeks, Alonso has been asked on several occasions about his communication with President Florentino Perez, and he explained that nothing was out of the norm in that regard.\n\n“We have always maintained constant communication with the president, Jose Angel [Sanchez, General Manager], and other people at the club. We are all in this together, acting with common sense and responsibility.”\n\nFollowing strong statements of support from Raul Asencio, Aurelien Tchouameni, Thibaut Courtois, Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo Goes during the week, Alonso was also asked if he felt the relationship had improved.\n\n“I’ve always felt that the relationship is good, and since we’re on the same path, we need that common goal,” despite having commented after their win over Olympiakos that he was happy with the ‘progress off the pitch’ following talks with the players.\n\nReal Madrid know that they could kick off on Sunday night seven points behind Barcelona and two points behind Villarreal if they win their respective games against Osasuna and Levante. Microscopic attention will be paid to Los Blancos’ showing against Alaves regardless.",

    "fullText": "Louis Vuitton will become the title partner of the Monaco Grand Prix from 2026, with the event confirmed to be named the Formula 1 Louis Vuitton Grand Prix de Monaco. This sees the luxury brand form a multi-year deal with F1 and the Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM), replacing last year's title, TAG Heuer.\n\nThe ACM has confirmed that Louis Vuitton will make up a large amount of its branding across the circuit as next year will see its 83rd race take place. This also comes as the championship aims to lean into its premium lifestyle partners following LVMH's 10-year global partnership that began last year. Louis Vuitton sits under the LVMH umbrella.\n\nLouis Vuitton is already a well-known name of the Monaco weekend, with its bespoke trophy trunk an iconic part of the grand prix. It had also partnered with ACM from 2021 to 2024. 2026 will bring the sixth consecutive trophy trunk, built in Asnières, with Monogram canvas reworked in red, plus a white-and-red “V” motif referencing “Vuitton and Victory” in a design inspired by the Monaco flag.\n\n“LVMH and Formula 1 are two global brands that consistently push the boundaries of creativity and innovation, values core to Liberty Media,\" Greg Maffei, president of Liberty Media, said following the announcement of the partnership with LVMH last year.\n\n\"We were thrilled to work with one of the LVMH Maisons during the Las Vegas Grand Prix last year, and to now expand our relationship with the Group as they become a Global Partner. The opportunity to scale our commercial arrangements is emblematic of the vision we have for Formula 1 as the business continues to grow its platform.\n\n\"We look forward to working with Bernard and Frédéric Arnault in the years to come.”\n\nStefano Domenicali, CEO of F1, added: “Our sport is founded on the relentless pursuit of excellence, a value that also lies at the heart of LVMH, so I am delighted to announce this historic partnership will begin in 2025.\n\n\"As Formula 1 continues its global growth, attracting new and more diverse audiences, the strength and breadth of LVMH makes it the perfect partner for us to work with as we look to continually enhance the experience of our fans and the heritage of our incredible sport.\n\n\"This is a landmark partnership for both companies, and I would like to thank Bernard and Frédéric Arnault for their vision and commitment to bring this to life.”\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "title": "Can Philip Rivers fend off Matt Stafford on NFL career passing list?",
    "description": "With Stafford close to overtaking Rivers on the list (and Rivers not far behind another legendary quarterback), we could see some movement this year.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers is back. Well, sort of back.\n\nAfter working out with the Colts earlier this week following a season-ending injury to starter Daniel Jones and an undisclosed injury to backup Riley Leonard, Rivers officially ended his retirement to sign with the Colts' practice squad. But initially, it seemed Rivers was a contingency plan for the Colts, and that they were hopeful Leonard would be healthy enough to start.\n\nNow, Leonard apparently \"feels great\" and has participated in three consecutive practices as of Friday. But Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who worked with Rivers for six seasons with the Chargers, would not confirm whether or not he planned to start Rivers this weekend, increasing the likelihood that we may see the 44-year-old veteran lace up his cleats for the first time in nearly five years after retiring following the 2020 season.\n\n\"He's got great command in the huddle. He was throwing it well. So we're excited for it. He's fired up for the challenge, getting back into it, getting back in the fold, feeling the pass rush. Got some good work in that,\" Steichen said.\n\n\"I'll say it was pretty good. A guy that hasn't been out there in five years, to go and practice the way he did this week was pretty impressive to watch.\"\n\nThose sound like the words of a coach who is impressed with his quarterback, so maybe it's not so crazy to think we'll see Rivers this week. And if we do, it will be just in time to defend his spot on the NFL all-time passing yards list. You see, Rivers currently ranks seventh in career passing yards, with 63,440 yards. But behind him at number eight on the list is another active quarterback – Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, with 63,163 yards.\n\nFor those whose strong suit isn't math, Stafford trails Rivers by just 277 yards. Stafford has thrown for that amount or more six times this season, including in last week's win over Arizona, where he tallied 281 passing yards. So really, Stafford is one good game away from the record. But this all changes if Rivers gets playing time this weekend.\n\nIf Rivers is back in action, then this becomes a race. And what if Rivers does play, performs well, and is back next year? You see, Stafford is getting older as well, and is currently 37 and playing his 17th NFL season. Yes, he looks to be at the top of his game, but the body won't hold out forever unless you're Philip Rivers, apparently. So who is to say Stafford doesn't end up trapped at eighth?\n\nAnd for another fun fact, Rivers needs just 649 yards to surpass Ben Roethlisberger for sixth all-time on the list. So if Rivers does get rolling or comes back for another year, he might knock Big Ben down a rung on the ladder as well. And above Roethlisberger? Well, that's current Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who passed the former Steelers signal caller at the beginning of this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Can Philip Rivers fend off Matt Stafford on NFL career passing list?",

    "description": "Here’s how the Buffalo Bills can continue their climb back up the AFC playoff ladder in Week 15.",
    "fullText": "A lot went the Buffalo Bills’ way in Week 14. A big win over quarterback Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals helped their case for a long postseason run. With four weeks of a full NFL schedule of games left to play, there’s plenty that’s still undecided, including who this year’s AFC East champion will be. The Bills can keep that undecided by redeeming their early season loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhile it will take help from their not-so-friendly division neighbors, the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets, a sixth straight crown for Buffalo isn’t impossible. Here’s a look at how things stand before we get into the heart of Week 15 action this weekend.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nBuffalo’s big win moved their playoff chances off the edge of extinction as they slid up one spot in the AFC Playoff Picture. The Patriots had a bye, and while it didn’t do anything to help the Bills move closer to the AFC East’s top spot, it did drop New England down to the conference’s two seed.\n\nThe Chiefs continue to slide and while technically still in the hunt, their season is looking more and more like a wash every week. The Colts have gone from being the AFC’s early season darlings to outside the playoffs looking in. Indianapolis is in the hunt, but they’ve lost their hunter as quarterback Daniel Jones added a season-ending Achilles injury to his already fractured fibula and has gone from hobbled to done for the season. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are playing Trading Spaces as they stay on a carousel of wins and losses bouncing the AFC North’s lead back and forth with the loser being relegated to odd-man-out (of the playoffs).\n\nThere’s a lot of football to be played in the next month, and the NFL schedule makers know what they’re doing with plenty of drama to unfold in these next few weeks. So, here’s a look at how we’d like to see things go during Week 15. Get ready Bills Mafia, it’s going to be another wild weekend!\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nBuffalo Bills (9-4) over New England Patriots (11-2), Sunday 1 p.m. EST (CBS)\n\nThis is the no-brainer one, right? You didn’t need me to tell you that we want a Bills win. But, even more importantly, we want a Patriots loss. If New England wins on Sunday, the crown is theirs. What a great week we would all have if we had to watch the Patriots put those hats and t-shirts away.\n\nOf course, the Bills have to keep winning, and the New England will need a loss to either Miami or the Jets, but first things first — Buffalo needs to take care of business in Foxborough, MA on Sunday.\n\nNew York Jets (3-10) over Jacksonville Jaguars (9-4), Sunday 1 p.m. EST (CBS)\n\nI know… division rivals. But the Jets aren’t exactly rivals. They aren’t threatening anyone in contention for a playoff spot. But the Jaguars? They’ve climbed their way back up to a division title spot (well, in part due to the the Colts’ recent landslide). While the battle between Jacksonville and Indianapolis doesn’t affect the Bills directly, should Buffalo regain the AFC East, having more wins than the other division leaders would result in some extra games at the soon-to-be gone forever Highmark Stadium.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (7-6) over Miami Dolphins (6-7), Monday 8:15 p.m. EST (ESPN)\n\nI know, I just said that the idea is to not let other division leaders get more wins. This is a little different. First, the Bills hold the tiebreaker over the Steelers. Second, Miami is trying to sneak back into the playoffs, and, well, I just don’t want to see that happen. Third (and maybe most importantly) a Pittsburgh win makes a January trip to Baltimore less and less likely regardless of what Lamar Jackson and the Ravens do.\n\nCincinnati Bengals (4-9) over Baltimore Ravens (6-7), Sunday 1 p.m. EST (CBS)\n\nA Ravens loss, coupled with wins by both Buffalo and Pittsburgh, will virtually ensure that quarterback Josh Allen won’t be playing in Baltimore this January. There would still be one more Steelers win needed to guarantee it, but one week at a time. So, the way to go here is to root for a huge game for Joe Burrow and keep your fingers crossed that he fixes the turnover issues he had in the fourth quarter in Buffalo.\n\nArizona Cardinals (3-10) over Houston Texans (8-5), Sunday 1 p.m. EST (FOX)\n\nHouston is a problem. They’re keeping things much too close for comfort in the wild card race. The Bills’ loss to the Texans back in November could come back to haunt them like the Ghost of Christmas Past and force them to take a trip back to Houston if they aren’t careful. It’s imperative that Buffalo stay ahead in the seeding, because Josh Allen might have been a cowboy, but he and Texas do not jive.\n\nKansas City Chiefs (6-7) over Los Angeles Chargers (9-4), Sunday 1 p.m. EST (CBS)\n\nHere I am again begging you not to shoot the messenger. It’s one of those weeks where a Kansas City win is what we need to be pulling for — even if you (like me) refuse to cheer for them. The Chiefs aren’t going to be among the AFC’s Top Seven at the end of this week no matter what happens, but a Chargers loss makes room for the Bills to move up a spot. You don’t have to get your chopping arm warmed up, but it’s okay to grin a little if KC comes out on top of this one.\n\nGreen Bay Packers (9-3-1) at Denver Broncos (11-2), Sunday 4:25 p.m. EST (CBS)\n\nOkay, I didn’t pick a winner here. My rule is to always go with “what we know” — but in this case, we don’t know anything. If the Bills win, then the Patriots lose. If the Patriots lose, a Broncos loss keeps the top of the AFC unchanged —- and that’s okay. That makes it easier for Buffalo to get a top seed if everything aligns in the final three weeks of the 2025 NFL season. But, if the Bills should lose, then obvioulsy the Patriots win. The petty part of me doesn’t want to see New England get the one seed, so I will be rooting for a Denver win to still keep the top of the conference the same. Since we will know how our Bills fare before this game starts, I’m not making a decision until then.\n\nSeattle Seahawks (10-3) over Indianapolis Colts (8-5), Sunday, 4:25 p.m. EST (CBS)\n\nThe Colts now have a 44-year-old quarterback who hasn’t taken a snap in five years. Phillip Rivers is going from having his name on the Hall of Fame ballot to having his name on the Come Back Player of the Year ballot. Regardless of who is under center, the chances of Indianapolis pulling off a win are slim. But just in case, root against them. This is the same scenario as with the Jaguars above. Should the Colts win the AFC South —- something that seemed like a given a month ago but now is looking like a long shot —- we don’t want them to have too many wins. We’re still rooting for the improbable (but not impossible) case of Buffalo winning the AFC East.\n\nHere, it’s all about a few things: Rooting for outcomes that improve Buffalo’s overall SOS or SOV, NFC vs. AFC, or taking the team that will better-position the Bills in the playoff race.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (7-6) over Atlanta Falcons (4-9) – SOV (Result: Falcons won)\nCleveland Browns (3-10) over Chicago Bears (9-4) – SOS\nPhiladelphia Eagles (8-5) over Las Vegas Raiders (2-11) – SOS\nCarolina Panthers (7-6) over New Orleans Saints (3-10) – SOV\nTennessee Titans (2-11) over San Francisco 49ers (9-4) – Draft Order\n\nGames that do not impact the Bills in Week 15\n\nWashington Commanders (3-10) at New York Giants (2-11)\nDetroit Lions (8-5) at Los Angeles Rams (10-3)\nMinnesota Vikings (5-8) at Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1)\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nSo, if all the bounces go the Bills’ way and all the right teams win, this is what the standings in the AFC would look like on Tuesday morning:\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nNow we know who to root for and, more importantly, who to root against, as it relates to the Buffalo Bills in Week 15. Go Bills!",

    "description": "The Commanders entered 2025 with high expectations, but almost nothing has gone right this season.",
    "fullText": "This time last year, the Washington Commanders were riding high. The team came out of nowhere and had one of the most explosive offenses in the league, with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels playing like a star.\n\nThe Commanders went on to make the NFC Championship Game last season, and there was no reason to think the team couldn't get back there this season. Instead, pretty much nothing has gone right, and the Commanders are much closer to being the worst team in the league than the best.\n\nThere's been a combination of factors that have led the Commanders to this point, but nobody thought it could get this bad. Entering Week 15, the Commanders have lost eight games in a row and are now sitting at 3-10.\n\nOn Friday, former Commanders quarterback Robert Griffin III appeared on 106.7 The Fan to talk about the team's disappointing season. Griffin revealed that the team had planned to add pieces to make a run during the season, but injuries and contract issues derailed the season.\n\n\"(Adam Peters) built the team as if JD5 was going to be healthy and we were going to add pieces to be able to help us get over the hump and go to the Super Bowl,\" explained Griffin. \"And then what derailed that?\" Injuries, Scary Terry's [McLaurin] contract situation, so it's a totally different set of circumstances.\"\n\nThe team planned to build on JD5's health and add pieces for a Super Bowl run. Then injuries and contract issues derailed everything. #NFL #Football #TeamBuilding #Injuries #Retooling pic.twitter.com/t2mDFok1Wg\n\n— 106.7 The Fan (@1067theFan) December 12, 2025\n\nBefore the season, McLaurin held out for a new deal and was often named in trade rumors. The two sides eventually reached an agreement, but Griffin thinks there may have been damage to team chemistry.\n\nAs far as injuries, it would be easier to name players who HAVEN'T been hurt this season. Austin Ekeler, Noah Brown, Marshon Lattimore, Dorance Armstrong, Deebo Samuel, Zach Ertz, Daniels, and McLaurin are all key contributors who have either missed time or are out for the season.\n\nIt would be hard for any team to overcome that number of injuries, and the Commander simply didn't have the depth to remain competitive.\n\n\"You have to say, 'Alright, we gotta retool. We have to get younger on defense, we have to get more speed,'\" Griffin said.\n\nGriffin certainly has a point there. The Commanders entered the 2025 season with the oldest average roster in the NFL. Aging players like Bobby Wagner and Von Miller were relied upon too heavily, and it wouldn't be surprising to see an overhaul on defense this offseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Robert Griffin III on what derailed 2025 season",

The dip comes as the US has faced a combination of policy changes, tariffs, and supply chain upheavals this year.\n\nThere were 1.7 million EVs sold in North America between January and November — far behind the 11.6 million sold in China and below the 3.8 million sold in Europe.\n\nUS automaker execs have been sounding the alarm bells on sales. In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that the EV market share in the US would nearly halve to around 5% in the near term.\n\nBenchmark Mineral Intelligence cited the $7,500 EV tax credit ending in September as a reason for \"subdued\" sales in the US, along with the Trump administration relaxing rules for automakers designed to encourage the transition to EVs and hybrids.\n\nElon Musk's Tesla has had a rocky year in almost all of its biggest markets, but it weathered the October drop-off better than its rivals, according to separate data from Cox Automotive. The world's most valuable car company, however, is facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nOther US EV makers have been hit by slowing demand, with GM and Rivian both announcing layoffs in recent months.\n\nChina's overall EV sales were up 19%. While BYD, the country's biggest EV maker, hit a rough patch in its home market amid rising competition from local startups, it set a record for EV exports in October.\n\nGlobally, EV sales were up 21% compared to last year, the Benchmark Mineral Intelligence data showed.\n\n\"Overall, EV demand remains resilient, supported by expanding model ranges and sustained policy incentives worldwide,\" said Charles Lester, data manager for Rho Motion, the Benchmark subsidiary behind the report.",

    "fullText": "Tesla is piling on incentives for buyers as it aims to end a rocky year on a high.\n\nElon Musk's automaker has introduced a smorgasbord of discounts and deals in the US, with Tesla facing a race against time to avoid a second consecutive year of declining sales.\n\nTesla is offering 0% APR financing for up to 72 months on select Model Y Standard purchases and is also advertising the option to lease a Model Y without a down payment on its website.\n\nBuyers can also trade in a gas car to receive 2,000 miles of free supercharging, and Tesla is offering complimentary upgrades, including premium paint jobs, tow hitches, and 19-inch \"Nova\" wheels valued at up to $1,500 on select inventory vehicles.\n\nTesla often offers more incentives toward the end of the year. But this time, the company is racing to avoid another year of declining sales, following Tesla's first-ever year-over-year fall in sales in 2024.\n\nRepeating that pattern would provide more evidence that Tesla's momentum is stalling after years of rapid growth.\n\nIn October last year, Musk predicted Tesla sales would grow 20-30% in 2025. Tesla needs to sell 555,000 EVs in the final three months of the year — more than it's ever sold in a quarter — just to match its sales figures from last year.\n\nThat's a tall order, with Tesla facing difficulties in all its main markets. The Cybertruck maker's sales have cratered in Europe amid backlash over Musk's politics. In China, Tesla has been squeezed by a wave of competition from local rivals.\n\nTesla also faces major headwinds in the US after the Trump administration scrapped the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs in September. Tesla's US sales fell 35% between September and October after the tax credit disappeared, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n\nIt comes as Musk has increasingly shifted Tesla's focus toward AI and robotics. The billionaire has described the steering wheel-less Cybercab and Tesla's Optimus robot as the future of the company, with both set to enter production next year.",

    "description": "A fight over words like \"execution,\" \"manifesto\" and \"Faraday\" is the undercard bout at Luigi Mangione's ongoing evidence-suppression hearing in NYC.",
    "fullText": "Yes, it's a fight over a backpack — how it was seized, how it was searched, and whether the gun and notebook found inside will be tossed or kept as knockout-blow evidence in a future murder trial.\n\nBut Luigi Mangione's ongoing evidence suppression hearing, playing out for two weeks in a Manhattan courtroom, is more than that.\n\nThe serious legal battle features an often amusing undercard bout: repeated sparring over nothing more than the naming of things.\n\nWas UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson shot on a Midtown sidewalk last year? Or was he \"executed?\"\n\nIs the red notebook found inside Mangione's backpack a \"manifesto,\" or a \"journal?\"\n\nAnd is the aluminum-lined pouch found in Mangione's backpack a \"Faraday bag,\" meant to block his cellphone from being tracked during a five-day manhunt? Or was the bag simply \"waterproof?\"\n\nIt all depends on who is standing at the courtroom's podium: lead defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo or top prosecutor Joel Seidemann.\n\nThese pretrial rhetorical rumbles foreshadow how intensely these two adversaries — seasoned legal veterans with decadeslong experience — will fight next year, at a yet-scheduled trial in the same state-level courtroom.\n\nThe temperament of the judge is also being previewed. NY Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro has alternated between seeming mildly irked and utterly unfazed as he's refereed these sporadic wars of words over the past two weeks.\n\n\"Move on,\" Carro has said when the prosecutor and defense lawyer complain about each other — like when Friedman Agnifilo stood up on Thursday to say of Seidemann, \"He wants to play the word 'manifesto' over and over and over again!\"\n\nCarro's relative calm has only wavered once, on Monday, after the prosecutor repeatedly referred to Thompson's murder as an \"execution.\"\n\n\"You testified you were aware of the New York City shooting?\" prior to the arrest, Friedman Agnifilo had asked the third Altoona, Pennsylvania, cop to take the stand. (Mangione was arrested in a McDonald's there five days after Thompson's December 4, 2024, shooting, after being spotted by customers.) \"You were aware it did not involve a bomb?\" she asked, scoring a point.\n\n\"Were you aware it involved a premeditated execution?\" Seidemann clapped back minutes later, visibly eager to take that point back.\n\nThe judge's voice was sharp as he sustained Friedman Agnifilo's objection. Soon afterward, she stood to complain about the prosecutor's repeated references to \"manifesto\" and \"the execution of Mr. Thompson.\"\n\n\"He certainly won't do that at trial,\" the judge warned.\n\n\"I'll bear that in mind, your honor,\" the prosecutor answered.\n\nA small \"Faraday bag,\" featuring a protective lining that blocks electronic signals, triggered an extended semantic skirmish on Tuesday.\n\nBoth the lawyer and the prosecutor were asking a lot of questions at the time, about this one little pouch. The size of a business envelope, it held an Apple cellphone, Mangione's passport, and a small wallet with a driver's license and three charge cards inside.\n\nIn questioning the officer who first pulled it out of the backpack, Friedman Agnifilo referred to the pouch as \"a black bag that has Velcro.\"\n\nShe also called it a \"waterproof bag,\" noting that other items in the backpack had been damp that day. (The same cop had testified that inside the backpack she'd found a gun clip filled with nine hollow-point rounds — wrapped in a pair of gray underwear that was \"soaking wet.\")\n\nWeren't electronics and a passport \"items that you'd want to keep dry?\" Friedman Agnifilo asked. \"Yes,\" the officer answered.\n\n\"Is that a Faraday bag or a waterproof bag?\" the prosecutor asked on his next turn at the podium, pointing to an image of the pouch.\n\n\"It's a Faraday bag,\" the cop answered.\n\n\"And how do you distinguish a Faraday bag from a waterproof bag?\" Seidemann pursued.\n\n\"This bag had an aluminum lining,\" the cop answered.\n\n\"If we can continue,\" he then said, turning toward the audience with a slight smile.\n\nMangione's evidence suppression hearing is scheduled to conclude next week. The judge has yet to say when he will rule on the admissibility of the backpack and its contents.\n\nThe Baltimore native is challenging the admissibility of evidence in both his state and federal murder prosecutions. Trial dates have yet to be set in both cases.",

    "description": "Rivian executives said AI and autonomy not only makes sense for their company, but also reflects the direction of the entire auto industry.",
    "fullText": "If there were a Venn diagram of a driver who wants an adventure-focused car with off-roading capability on one side and a driver who wants a software-centric, computer-first car that could drive itself on the other, would there be a lot of overlap between the two circles?\n\nOn Thursday, Rivian hosted an \"Autonomy & AI Day\" at the company's research and development hub in Palo Alto, where hundreds witnessed the EV maker's grand leap into the future: a highly integrated AI assistant and fully autonomous driving capability, all powered by Rivian's very own silicon chip.\n\nWassym Bensaid, Rivian's Chief Software Officer, called the move a \"profound platform shift which changes our product and everything we do at the company.\"\n\nBensaid is among the key executives leading the charge toward Rivian's \"AI-defined vehicle,\" along with James Philbin, VP of Autonomy & AI, and Vidya Rajagopalan, Senior VP of Rivian's electrical hardware division.\n\nDuring the event, I had the chance to talk to Bensaid and Philbin about the pivot and whether it makes sense for a company that, since its inception, has branded itself as an adventure-forward vehicle, or if this is just a response to consumer demand.\n\nPhilbin, who was a director at Zoox and Waymo before joining Rivian in 2022, told me that pursuing autonomy has long been part of the company's trajectory rather than an overnight decision.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Philbin sees a rising \"tide\" in consumer demand for some level of autonomy — especially as robotaxis become mainstream.\n\n\"We are starting to see that autonomy is a really important purchase decision with customers, and especially customers who come from vehicles with maybe high levels of autonomy,\" he said. \"They don't go back.\"\n\nPhilbin said that having a high-level advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) was cited as one of the \"top three purchase reasons\" for Rivian customers. However, the demand will extend to all automakers, he said.\n\n\"I just see it becoming such a key purchase driver for vehicles going forward,\" Philbin said. \"And I think every OEM will have to deliver these features to customers in some way.\"\n\nA year ago, Bensaid told me that the future of cars would be hands-free, and that using buttons or fiddling with the touchscreen would be \"an anomaly.\"\n\n\"It's a bug, it's not a feature,\" he said at the time. \"Ideally, you would want to interact with your car through voice. And the problem today is that most voice assistants are just broken.\"\n\nThursday's demonstration of the Rivian Assistant, an in-car AI assistant that can control certain vehicle functions, brought Bensaid's vision to life. I saw the Rivian Assistant pull up navigation directions and control the direction of the air vents through voice control.\n\nBensaid told me at the event that \"cars and automotive are probably the killer app for AI.\"\n\n\"In your 30-minute or 45-minute commute every day, you want to get your time back, you want to really take control of your time,\" he said.\n\nWhen I asked the software chief where the overlap was between Rivian's adventure brand and its AI push, Bensaid said the company \"inspires many types of customers.\"\n\n\"I think at the core of the brand, Rivian wants people to explore the world,\" he said, and that there were different ways to do so, whether that's by going off-road or exploring the world through technology.\n\nAt the same time, Bensaid said, \"At heart, we are a technology company, so technology is really a big part of the user experience, how we see ourselves, and how we present ourselves to the world.\"\n\nBensaid's statement touches upon another key focus beyond the automaker's line-up of premium trucks and SUVs: software licensing.\n\nRivian's joint venture with the German automotive giant Volkswagen was a clear sign of its intent to license its software platform to other automakers in the future.\n\nPart of the tech will include self-driving capabilities, which the entire automotive world — legacy and startup — is exploring, Steve Man, senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told me.\n\n\"We don't really know at the end of the day if there's going to be a huge mass adoption,\" Man said of autonomy. Still, the analyst adds that \"it's a must\" for car makers to pursue.\n\nSales of Tesla's Full Self-Driving Supervised reflect that uncertainty. CEO Elon Musk has presented FSD as the key driver of the company's valuation even though the adoption rate of FSD remains at around 12%, Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's Chief Financial Officer, said in October.\n\nThe automotive industry still remains bullish on autonomy and AI.\n\nNissan partnered with UK-based Wayve, which develops software for advanced driver assistance systems. General Motors teased plans for an eyes-off driving system for 2028. And Mercedes unveiled a hands-off, eyes-off ADAS a few years ago.\n\nA recent Bloomberg Intelligence report said that nearly half of C-suite auto executives surveyed said they expect AI to lift sales and profits by 9% over the next two to three years.\n\n\"From a business perspective, you don't know if it is going to take off, but you need to invest some money now so that you're not behind,\" Man said, \"and you have the opportunity to roll it out if it is something that people want.\"",

    "description": "Renee and Kelley Hayes bought an RV when they became empty nesters. They ended up living in it and are happy with downsizing.",
    "fullText": "Empty nesters Renee and Kelley Hayes, 58, downsized from an over 2,000 square-foot home in Texas to a roughly 45-foot RV.\n\n\"We may be living tiny, but we've got the world's largest suitcase,\" Kelley said.\n\nKelley dreamed of living in an RV and traveling the country full-time during retirement. However, he and his wife got to embrace this goal a few years earlier than intended.\n\nThey loved raising a family in their Texas home with a three-car garage and a pool, but they're happy exploring the US as retired empty nesters in their RV. They get to see what different states offer, such as the Grand Canyon in Arizona and the hot air balloon festival in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\n\"We camped right on the grounds where the balloons took off, so every morning the balloons would fly over, right over the RV itself, and at night they would have the glow,\" Kelley said.\n\nRenee and Kelley purchased an RV for roughly $82,000 in August 2018, while their kids attended college. They were looking for something to do as new empty nesters. A few months later, Kelley, who worked for General Motors before his retirement in 2022, was transferred to an office in Georgia, which meant leaving Texas and figuring out their next home.\n\nThe family spent the 2018 holidays on the road and then visited Twin Lakes RV Park, a campground in Georgia, right after Christmas.\n\nKelley looked at some houses in January, but nothing caught his eye. Plus, Renee said, housing prices were expected to drop in Georgia, which could have meant selling their next home would be tougher. \"We knew we were only going to be there three years, so we thought instead of taking that risk, we can just live in our RV,\" she said.\n\nRenee went back to Texas to downsize and work on selling their home, while Kelley stayed in Georgia for work, residing in the Twin Lakes RV Park. They listed the home for $399,000 in January 2019, and it sold in March. Renee rejoined Kelley at the campground.\n\nThey traveled during COVID when Kelley's job at the GM regional office went remote, and then Kelley retired at 55 in 2022. He said he still did some contract work until last year. Since Kelley retired, they have split their time between traveling and caring for Renee's family farmhouse in Michigan, enjoying alternating between being fairly stationary in the summer and traveling for the other half of the year.\n\nKelley and Renee still make some money. They earn from social media content, and Kelley said he does \"odds and end jobs up there in the summertime, working for farmers\" or Renee's father.\n\nThey use Harvest Hosts, a membership for overnight stays at wineries, golf courses, and other places. They stay at campgrounds, parks, and park in friends' or family members' driveways, among other places.\n\n\"We do it to see things and have adventures, but also to spend time with friends and family,\" Renee said.\n\nThere are a lot of logistics that can come with living on the road, such as whether you sell your home, what kind of RV to live in, and how to maintain it. Renee suggested people downsize before jumping into RV life and start early because it can take a while to go through all the items accumulated over the years.\n\nRenee and Kelley still have lots of space to live in their model. Kelley said the back is basically a multipurpose room. \"It's our mud room, it's our garage where we house our bikes, our kayaks, our tools, it's our secondary bedroom for when the kids come to stay,\" he said, adding they also eat there, and it opens up to a patio.\n\nRenee said fuel can be expensive, potentially adding up to hundreds in just a month. \"The slower you go and the longer you stop and are stationary, that helps keep your costs down on fuel,\" she said.\n\nHowever, they don't have to pay for Texas' property taxes, which tend to be high. They also don't have to pay for other home expenses like homeowners' association fees and house upkeep.\n\nAlthough they are saving on home costs, they still have expenses that can add up. They said they pay for medical, two phones, internet, insurance, groceries, entertainment, and subscriptions to RV and travel-related apps. Tire replacements can also be costly. The couple noted they spent hundreds of dollars between September and November to stay at multiple RV parks.\n\nThe couple, who post about their travels on social media, sometimes stay for free in exchange for promotional content.\n\nBecause living in an RV can require a lot of maintenance, Renee recommends taking some courses to learn how to repair things on your own. \"If you're not mechanical or if you're not handy, this could become very expensive,\" Renee said. \"Luckily, Kelley's handy and he's able to pretty much repair or replace things as we go.\"\n\nShe also suggested renting an RV before buying if you have never been in one before, to see what it's like. Kelley said there are RV shows that people can go to so they can figure out what they want to travel in, because finding the perfect way to travel for someone can take time, just like finding a home.\n\nUltimately, the couple thinks people interested should just take the leap and do it. The couple said they are happy to help answer people's questions.\n\n\"There are so many people when you get to a campground that will help you,\" Kelley said.\n\nThe couple plan to continue this lifestyle for as long as they're able to, even if it means downsizing further. Renee said she doesn't drive the truck with the 45-foot RV attached, but would be able to if they had a smaller vehicle.\n\n\"Our priority right now is to see and do stuff rather than to accumulate stuff,\" Renee said.",

    "title": "I run a $130,000-a-week burnout clinic for CEOs. After my life started to fall apart, I burned out too.",
    "description": "The founder of Paracelsus Recovery, a $130,000-a-week inpatient clinic for CEOs, missed the signs of his own burnout before seeking treatment.",
    "fullText": "This essay is based on a conversation with Jan Gerber, 44, who runs the Paracelsus Recovery clinic in Zurich. Business Insider has verified his admission to another Swiss clinic for burnout. The piece has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2022, I realized something was wrong. I had almost lost my company, my marriage was falling apart, and it felt like everything hit all at once. I did outpatient therapy while things were unraveling, but I was clearly getting worse.\n\nAbout six months later, that December, I checked myself into an inpatient program in Zurich, where I was diagnosed with acute depression brought on by stress. The symptoms fit burnout, too — burnout and depression often overlap.\n\nAt the time, I had spent 12 years helping other people recover from burnout, depression, and addiction. I'm the founder of Paracelsus Recovery, a private clinic in Zurich that treats executives, founders, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals who require discreet and private care. A six-week stay can cost around $800,000.\n\nIt all started when a friend of a friend, the CEO of a major, publicly listed corporation, called my parents, who worked in the mental health space, for help, and moved into their guest room for treatment. The person needed very discreet treatment for alcohol addiction — if it went public, the stock market impact could have been in the billions.\n\nI previously worked in consulting and medical concierge services, and had launched my own businesses in the travel sector. So, the entrepreneur in me realized there was a niche here: offering discreet treatment for people who couldn't just go to any old rehab.\n\nIn 2011, I co-founded a clinic in the high-end mental health space with my mother and then step-father, which initially offered one-on-one care. In 2012, this became Paracelsus Recovery.\n\nIn the early years of Paracelsus Recovery, we had a small number of clients, but it took years to establish a reputation. The high cost is a big hurdle for potential clients. We primarily find ultra-high-net-worth clients through family offices and membership organizations, such as Campden Wealth.\n\nAbout half are members of wealthy families, trust fund babies who don't develop a sense of purpose or drive. The other half is a mix of royalty, entertainers, entrepreneurs, founders, and top executives — those who have the funds to come to us.\n\nClients rarely experience burnout on its own. In many cases, people are self-medicating and in a cycle of taking downers like sleeping pills in the evening, then stimulants in the morning, such as ADHD medication or illicit drugs like cocaine. Eventually, they reach a dead end.\n\nOften, burnout is not solely prompted by the number of hours worked, but also by the responsibility of overseeing thousands of employees, investors, and business partners, which weighs heavily on their shoulders. If you're in the public eye or run a public company, where, for example, earnings aren't meeting expectations, that can also have a significant impact on stress levels.\n\nThe average worker typically seeks burnout treatment after a spouse, their kids, or employer tells them they can't show up late or get drunk every night anymore. Founders and professional executives tend to have much more to lose, and a network of people who help them conceal some of their issues. As a result, they'll hold on for dear life until they just can't anymore. And, in general, they seek help much later.\n\nSleep is usually the first to go. That was a massive red flag for me. I used to be a good sleeper, even in stressful times, but it started to deteriorate — not just a week or a month, but about half a year of restless nights. By the time these CEOs seek treatment, it's often when a substance is involved, and it's showing up as a fatty liver or cardiovascular issues, coming from alcohol abuse, for example.\n\nWe offer a 10-day program called an \"Executive Detox.\" These programs don't solve everything, but they stabilize clients and buy them some time. On average, people stay with us for six weeks; however, in extreme cases, they may stay for six months or more.\n\nA week at Paracelsus Recovery costs around £100,000, or about $131,000. This includes a private residence, a chef, a driver, a live-in therapist, and a daily schedule of psychotherapy, medical treatments, infusions, and complementary therapies such as yoga, acupuncture, and fitness training.\n\nMy own treatment at another clinic encouraged me to introduce treatments such as shiatsu and breath-work.\n\nSuccess is relative. For me, it mostly means that someone leaves equipped with the tools to live a better life. Treatment at a clinic like Paracelsus Recovery is what I consider an acute stabilization, while the real work happens afterward. People should have ongoing therapy and support.\n\nTo recover from burnout, the most vital thing — and it's hard for career executives and entrepreneurs to hear — is to pull the emergency brake. If you continue to hold on for another week, another month, or step back halfway while the stress persists, you'll still crash.\n\nYou have to decide between investing in the quality of your life over just your career trajectory.\n\nPersonally, I didn't do that. For the sake of business continuity, I had to hang on. I still haven't fully recovered. I still feel brain fog from being burned out, and my memory is worse than it was. I'm not sure if it will ever return.\n\nBut my own experience, and my treatment at another clinic in Zurich, taught me about the value of proper inpatient treatment.\n\nAt Paracelsus Recovery, we typically treat only three or four clients at a time, which makes for a warmer and more personal experience, whereas the Swiss Clinic I attended had a capacity of about 75 patients.\n\nOur patients stay in penthouse apartments with lake views, where most of their treatments take place. No day is like another, as treatment is tailored for each client. They have access to medical treatments, a midday IV to rebalance their biochemistry, as well as a personal trainer and private chef. Their food and supplements are curated based on their lab tests and genetics.\n\nYes, the price tag is very high, but you get a lot for your money. Besides, there's no price on health and well-being.",

    "description": "UBS's billionaire clients say they're increasingly leaning away from the US. They say they're looking at opportunities in two other parts of the world.",
    "fullText": "Over the last few months, we've written about where billionaires live and how the uber-rich spend their money.\n\nA new report from UBS has the answers. This year, the bank conducted its annual survey of billionaire clients on several topics, including where they plan to invest their money for 12-month and five-year periods.\n\nOptimism in the near term seems to be highest around two areas in particular compared to 2024: Western Europe and China.\n\nForty percent of respondents said they see opportunity in Western Europe over the next 12 months, up from 18% in 2024. For China, 34% of respondents see opportunity versus 11% last year.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region, excluding China, also saw an eight percentage point jump in interest, with 33% of respondents bullish.\n\nOn the flip side, North America has dipped the most in popularity. While 80% of respondents liked the region in the 2024 survey, just 63% said they did in 2025\n\nThe shifts in sentiment are due to a number of risks that worry billionaires, the primary among them being tariffs.\n\nSixty-six percent of respondents cited tariffs as one of the factors \"most likely to negatively impact the market environment over 12 months.\" That was followed by a potential major geopolitical conflict at 63%, policy uncertainty at 59%, and higher inflation at 44%.\n\n\"I do not see North America as the top investment destination, even though its markets remain deep and innovative,\" one of UBS's European clients said. \"For us, geographic concentration creates risk, and the better opportunity lies in diversification. We prefer to shift focus toward real assets, which offer more tangible value and protection in volatile or inflationary environments. Equities over bonds can make sense in the current cycle, but our approach emphasizes stability and resilience rather than short-term market moves.\"\n\nStill, while shorter-term outlooks have changed since last year, views for the next five years have generally stayed the same for most regions compared to 2024.\n\nThe report also shared which assets exactly billionaire investors plan to put their money into.\n\nPrivate, not public, equity was the most common asset where respondents said they intend to put their money over the next 12 months. Forty-nine percent said they plan to have their money in direct private equity investments.\n\nThe next most common places to invest were in hedge funds and public developed market equities, both at 43%. Emerging market public equities (37%) and private equity funds (35%) were the next most popular answers.\n\nAt the same time, respondents also showed higher intentions of pulling their money out of private equity than publicly traded stocks.\n\nExamples of funds that offer exposure to the public assets billionaire investors are most bullish on for the year ahead include the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF (EZU), iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI), the Global X Emerging Markets ex-China ETF (EMM), and the Vanguard Tax Managed Fund FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA).",

    "fullText": "Gen Z is embracing one decades-old phenomenon: Trading card games like Pokémon.\n\nCollectible card games were the most-purchased secondhand product category for Gen Z in the US on eBay so far this year, according to data from the e-commerce platform.\n\nThe trend was especially clear among Gen Z men, who collectively shifted spending from electronics to trading cards and other collectibles, according to eBay. Trading cards were also the top secondhand sales category among Gen Z women on the platform, followed by books and cameras.\n\nWhile trading cards for franchises such as Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! initially became popular with kids and teens in the US in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the data shows that the cards remain popular, even among those who were born as they were taking off.\n\nPart of the enduring popularity is because those people who grew up with trading cards are now passing the interest on to their own kids, Aaron Ottensmann, a 29-year-old who runs card sales business SassyTCG, told Business Insider.\n\n\"You're starting to see people like me having kids, and they're picking up starter decks and playing with their kids,\" Ottensmann said.\n\nWhile Ottensmann said he sources cards from distributors, the business has become competitive enough that some newer sellers buy cards at retailers like Walmart and Costco, then resell them.\n\nOther customers are after high-dollar cards, with some turning to trading cards as an alternative to investing in the stock market.\n\nIn early December on Ottensmann's eBay shop, shoppers could find about two dozen cards or packs of cards priced over $1,000. His most expensive sale over the past year, a set of 127 early Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, sold for about $75,000 through eBay.\n\nTrading cards are one part of the broader secondhand sales market, which eBay said is expanding in a report released last month.\n\nAbout 82% of survey respondents said they planned to spend more on secondhand items this holiday season than they did in 2024, according to the company's Recommerce Report.\n\nShopping secondhand has gained popularity this year, especially as President Donald Trump's tariffs have raised the price of some goods and added costs to items ordered from outside the US.\n\nDo you have a story idea?

    "description": "A lack of lounges has long been JetBlue's glaring weak spot, but BlueHouse represents the airline's greater push to elevate its premium offering.",
    "fullText": "JetBlue Airways has finally added the one premium perk it's been missing for years.\n\nCome December 18, the low-cost carrier will open its first-ever airport lounge — a two-story, art-deco-inspired retreat called BlueHouse — at its New York-JFK Terminal 5 home base.\n\nA lack of lounges has long been JetBlue's glaring weak spot, but BlueHouse represents JetBlue's greater push to elevate its premium offerings.\n\nIt complements Mint, the airline's flagship business class, and the new domestic first-class seat set to arrive in 2026.\n\nI toured the 9,000-square-foot BlueHouse ahead of its opening, and it is quintessentially \"New York.\"\n\nThere's colorful artwork — including three pieces created by JetBlue employees — a ceiling mural painted as an ode to Grand Central Terminal, and a help desk adorned with a wall of vintage post office boxes (and they have little surprises inside if you ask).\n\nBlueHouse is a vibe closer to a boutique hotel lobby in Midtown than a traditional airline club. JetBlue envisions this as an exclusive spot to relax with a free drink or to work away from the busy terminal crowds.\n\nCompared to competitors' flashier lounges, the BlueHouse service has no showers or full buffets, which could disappoint some customers.\n\nStill, guests can enjoy complimentary hot and cold quick food like breakfast burritos, sandwiches, parfaits, and salads.\n\nI liked the food, but it's simple, and there are few options to start. It's more of a grab-and-go experience rather than a sit-down. But meal options may expand; JetBlue said a kitchen would open in 2026.\n\nThe lounge also sports social areas, private workspaces, power ports, a full lineup of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks across its two bars and coffee stations, and a dedicated game room for kids or families.\n\nBigger airlines have worked to satisfy their customers with lounges, and JetBlue's entry is erring on the side of small and exclusive.\n\nDuring the media walkthrough, JetBlue's head of loyalty, Ed Pouthier, said access will be intentionally limited at first to avoid overcrowding in the 140-person space. Think roughly the size of an average Trader Joe's.\n\nThe lounge is a perk for JetBlue's executive travelers and a way to entice more travelers to its new credit card. Only transatlantic Mint business class passengers, Mosaic 4 loyalty members (the highest tier of JetBlue's status ladder), and JetBlue Premium credit cardholders can enter. The latter two get one free guest; extra guests cost $39.\n\nNo Blue Basic passengers, which is JetBlue's budget, bare-bones fare, and no domestic Mint business class customers will be allowed in. And there is no reciprocal entry for United MileagePlus elites, despite the airlines' loyalty partnership.\n\n\"We promised ourselves when we came up with the idea that we would never have lines,\" Pouthier said.\n\nHe added that limited-access passes will be available for purchase starting in February for Mosaic 1, 2, and 3 loyalty members, JetBlue Plus and Business cardholders, and non-transatlantic Mint customers.\n\nThese early restrictions appear to be JetBlue's answer to the long queues that have plagued its competitors. It remains to be seen how the queue will look once JetBlue introduces paid access, especially with its smaller capacity.\n\nDelta's SkyClubs, for example, have become known for snaking queues, which prompted the airline to rewrite its own access rules in 2023. United Airlines similarly tightened its Club Lounge access in March by upping the price of membership.\n\nBlueHouse is the first of at least two JetBlue lounges, with Boston expected to follow in 2026. CEO Joanna Geraghty teased a potential Fort Lauderdale location at an industry conference last week.\n\nJetBlue President Marty St. George acknowledged that customers like consistency, but said future lounges depend on whether JetBlue can grow its base of Mosaic elites and premium credit card holders enough to justify the investment.\n\nThe $499-a-year JetBlue Premium credit card — launched in January — is already proving lucrative, with St. George saying JetBlue exceeded its 2025 sign-up goal by roughly 67%.\n\n\"We saw the lounge as being sort of the flagship benefit,\" he said.\n\nJetBlue Premium card benefits also include up to $300 in travel statements, free checked luggage, and access to the global airport lounge network, Priority Pass — a clever way for JetBlue to provide lounge access to more customers without building its own.\n\nBlueHouse is a significant step for JetBlue, finally giving it a stronger foothold in the premium space — and the news comes a day after Southwest Airlines' CEO, Bob Jordan, told CNBC that lounges would be a \"huge, next benefit\" for its customers.\n\nBoth low-cost airlines are trying to catch up to their legacy rivals.\n\nAmerican, Delta, and United operate extensive networks of lounges — sometimes running more than one in the same airport — that are increasingly designed like luxury hotels with full-service restaurants, wellness rooms, and chef-made menus.",

    "description": "Zohran Mamdani, currently a state assemblyman, is set to get a large raise when he takes office as mayor of New York City.",
    "fullText": "Zohran Mamdani is about to get a massive raise — and some swanky new accommodations.\n\nMamdani is set to earn a $258,750 annual salary as New York City mayor, a more than 80% increase from the $142,000 annual salary that he earns as a state assemblyman.\n\nHe's also set to move into Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence, where he will not have to pay rent.\n\nIn a statement released this week, Mamdani said the decision to move into Gracie Mansion \"came down to our family's safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for.\"\n\nMamdani will take office on January 1, 2026.\n\nForbes has estimated that the state assemblyman's net worth is about $200,000. He currently lives in a rent-stabilized apartment in Astoria and has said that his monthly rent is $2,300.\n\nOn the one hand, Mamdani's hefty new salary shouldn't be a huge surprise: The demands and responsibilities of managing a city of more than 8 million people are far greater than representing roughly 140,000 people in Queens.\n\nAnd it's not the highest mayoral salary out there: The mayor of San Francisco earns a salary of more than $380,000, while the mayor of Los Angeles earns just over $300,000.\n\nStill, it's far more than the $174,000 annual salary earned by most rank-and-file US senators and House members.\n\nIt's also more than the $223,500 annual salary that House Speaker Mike Johnson earns, or the $246,400 annual salaries of President Donald Trump's cabinet secretaries.\n\nMike Bloomberg, a billionaire, notably declined to accept the full salary during his tenure as mayor from 2002 to 2013, choosing instead to accept a $1 salary.\n\nAlmost every New York City mayor has lived at some point in Gracie Mansion, a two-story home on the Upper East Side overlooking the East River.\n\nThe one exception: Bloomberg, who opted to live in his own mansion a few blocks away on East 79th Street.\n\nThe former mayor even said that his successors shouldn't live in the mansion, but that advice apparently went unheeded: Mayor Bill de Blasio moved into the house in 2014, and Mayor Eric Adams also opted to live there.\n\nThe mayor also receives security protection from the New York City Police Department and has access to benefits available to other city employees, including health insurance.\n\nIn his statement on his impending move out of Astoria, Mamdani said that he and his wife Rama would \"miss much about our home in Astoria,\" including \"cooking dinner side by side in our kitchen, sharing a sleepy elevator ride with our neighbors in the evening, hearing music and laughter vibrate through the walls of the apartment.\"\n\n\"I will be a mayor for the line cooks on Steinway, for the children swinging at Dutch Kills Playground, for the bus riders waiting for the Q101,\" Mamdani said. \"While I may no longer live in Astoria, Astoria will always live inside me and the work I do.\"",

    "title": "No, you're not seeing Hermès Kelly bags everywhere. Women are carrying look-alike purses from Tory Burch.",
    "description": "Tory Burch released its Lee Radziwill bag years ago — but it's becoming popular now. People love the quality, functionality, and style of the purse.",
    "fullText": "Paige Stansbury grew up shopping at Tory Burch.\n\nEach year, she'd vacation in Texas and shop at Houston's Galleria mall with her family. There, her grandmother always bought her a new pair of the designer's monogrammed ballet flats.\n\n\"I never really liked them,\" Stansbury, 23, admitted to Business Insider. \"But my grandma, she gets me into everything. She's a style icon.\"\n\nSo, when Stansbury saw a photo of a Lee Radziwill bag from Tory Burch in 2022, the social-media marketing professional added one in the petite size to her holiday wish list.\n\nIt was her grandmother, of course, who bought it for her.\n\n\"My grandma said it's the best bag and that I'd be obsessed with it,\" Stansbury said. \"I didn't start wearing it until recently, but she was right.\"\n\nShe loves her Lee Radziwill so much that she even made a TikTok video praising the purse. The post now has 2.3 million views, and countless comments from people who said they're buying their own.\n\nThe latter is just one reason the style is becoming a fashion status symbol for 2026.\n\nThough it's gaining traction now, the Lee Radziwill line from Tory Burch isn't new.\n\nIt was actually introduced in 2018 as an homage to its namesake, Lee Radziwill — a socialite, the sister of Jackie Kennedy, and a personal friend of designer Tory Burch.\n\nThe line features bags in various colors, sizes, and materials, all of which are square in shape. They also feature top shoulder straps and magnetic buckles across the front. They range in price between $520 and $1,320.\n\nIn June, Tory Burch began teasing a suede version of its Lee Radziwill bags on TikTok.\n\nAfter posting numerous videos throughout the summer, celebrities like Jessica Alba, Mindy Kaling, Ciara, and Emma Roberts carried their own Lee Radziwill bags at New York Fashion Week in September.\n\nOne fan said in a TikTok that month that the brand was \"relentlessly marketing\" the style, which caught her attention. When she went to purchase the bag, though, it was already sold out.\n\nThen, Stansbury's TikTok post about her Lee Radziwill bag went viral in December. In the comment section of her video, shoppers seemed eager to get their hands on the purses.\n\n\"Do I need another bag? No. Will I be buying this bag? Clearly, yes!\" one person wrote.\n\n\"That bag is so chic and exactly what I didn't know I wanted,\" another person commented.\n\nSome styles have since sold out online, and the brand posted a TikTok video on Monday that described its Lee Radziwill purse as \"the bag that broke the internet.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Tory Burch did not respond to a request for comment on the bag's popularity and plans for future releases.\n\nNicole King, 25, wasn't always a fan of Tory Burch. That changed in 2022 when she got her first Lee Radziwill bag. Now, the full-time content creator has a collection of eight.\n\n\"I have this icy-blue suede one, and to this day, it's the prettiest bag I've seen in my life,\" King told Business Insider. \"I always say that if there were ever a fire, that's one of the items I would save.\"\n\nShe's also a big fan of the miniature version of the bag, which she said is more functional than you'd think. When she got her first one, King said, she wore it for four months straight.\n\n\"It was my go-to, and I carry a lot of stuff on me,\" she said. \"It's also really easy to throw on. I forget that I'm carrying it.\"\n\nThen there's Chelsea Clark, a 38-year-old healthcare marketing professional who grew up with Tory Burch accessories.\n\nShe told Business Insider that she'd been eyeing Lee Radziwill bags since 2020 and officially bought her own in November.\n\nShe chose one in teal for a few reasons. First, she'd had a color analysis done and learned that she's a true winter. The bag matched her color palette. Second, she wanted something unique.\n\n\"The size was also a factor,\" Clark said. \"I'm 6 feet tall, and it's hard to find bags that I feel look good on really tall women. Most bags are too small or too large, like a weekender. My Lee Radziwill is the perfect size.\"\n\nAll three agreed that while the bags aren't necessarily cheap, they're worth splurging on.\n\n\"Some people have complained about the price, but at least it's not $4,000 for something that will tarnish and break,\" Stansbury said, adding that \"$660 for a bag that will hold is a great price.\"\n\nLet's not ignore the Hermès elephant in the room. Lee Radziwill bags, especially in the petite size, look a bit like Kelly bags from the famous French luxury brand.\n\nThey have similar shapes, matching buckle straps (or sangles, as Hermès refers to them), and are of a similar size. For many fans, that's part of the appeal. Why spend months trying to buy a $10,000 bag when you can pay $660 for a similar style from Tory Burch?\n\nOthers see things differently. The bags have similarities, sure, and there's no question that Hermès offers a flashier, more luxurious accessory — but some fans prefer Tory Burch's design.\n\nClark said she particularly likes that the Lee Radziwill bags have flat bottoms with no feet and a variety of pocket options.\n\n\"There's a timelessness to the bags,\" she said. \"The style of the Lee Radziwill, you can dress it up, or you can dress it down. I can't tell what timeline this bag is from when I look at it. It always looks modern to me.\"\n\nAnd luckily for Tory Burch, it's making the brand cool again.\n\nClark remembers a conversation with a young colleague in the recent past. She said they described the accessories brand to her as \"cheugy,\" or a cringy, millennial fad.\n\nThanks to Lee Radziwill bags, members of Gen Z are changing their tune.\n\n\"Every time I have it on me, someone compliments the bag,\" Stansbury said. \"It's constant.\"",

    "description": "Wealthy heirs are reshaping family offices around impact and innovation, but the talent to run them is scarce, a new IMD report says.",
    "fullText": "The next generation of leaders wants their family offices to look different from those run by their parents — and that shift is driving fierce competition for a new class of talent.\n\nA new report from IMD's Global Family Business Center and the Family Business Network, based on 186 survey responses and 65 interviews with family principals across six continents in the first two quarters of this year, found that family offices are rapidly evolving as younger heirs step into leadership roles.\n\nThe report said younger family members increasingly prioritize impact investing, sustainability, technological innovation, and diversity and inclusion — particularly in the advisors and specialists they choose to hire.\n\nAs a result, they seek advisors who can navigate these areas — and job listings have surged for individuals with these skills, including alternative investment analysts, ESG specialists, and chief information officers who can modernize systems and streamline operations.\n\nBut the supply of qualified candidates \"has not kept pace,\" the report warned.\n\nFamily offices require a blend of hard technical skills and softer traits — trustworthiness, discretion, emotional intelligence, and the ability to work inside complex family systems — that's rare even in top-tier finance.\n\nThis \"changing of the guard,\" the report said, has created an acute scarcity of talent and a \"highly competitive market for top-tier professionals.\"\n\nFamily offices are multiplying rapidly, with Deloitte estimating a 31% increase from 2019 to late 2024, as founders cash out and heirs prepare for a historic wealth transfer, according to the IMD's report.\n\n\"By and large, we can see that there just isn't enough talent available for the families and their family offices,\" Peter Vogel, one of the report's authors and Director of the IMD Global Family Business Center, told Business Insider.\n\nVogel, also a professor of family business and entrepreneurship, said that the first big hires are usually investment-focused — people with backgrounds in private equity, private debt, real estate, or venture capital.\n\nFamilies that care about sustainability or impact will add ESG (environmental, social, and governance) expertise and impact-metrics skills on top, he added.\n\nBeyond technical chops, Vogel said families increasingly look for candidates who bring emotional intelligence, trustworthiness, and experience handling family dynamics — qualities he described as essential but hard to find.\n\nBut even when families are willing to pay, the pitch isn't always as attractive as it looks.\n\n\"One of the big questions is, what is the value proposition for a top shot to join a family office?\" Vogel said.\n\nVogel said that for senior hires like CIOs or CEOs, family offices offer limited upward mobility: once you reach the top job, there's nowhere else to go except a larger family office.\n\nVogel added that while family-office compensation can be strong, it often falls short of the millions of dollars top performers can earn in big banks, private equity, or hedge funds — especially without co-investment or carried interest.\n\nMichael Kosnitzky, Co-Leader of Pillsbury's Private Client & Family Office practice, previously told Business Insider that family offices are increasingly structuring \"golden handcuffs\" — long-term incentive packages designed to make it costly or unattractive for executives to leave — and carried-interest-style deals to stop their CIOs and dealmakers from being poached by rival funds or other family offices.\n\nOn top of that, Vogel said, the market itself is opaque.\n\nThe term \"family office\" isn't regulated, and titles are vague, he said, which makes it harder to find talent because roles vary widely from one office to another, and there's no standard job description. Many professionals also don't publicly name the families they work for.\n\n\"There's no big, qualified database of people saying, 'hand up, I'm a family office person,'\" Vogel said.\n\nFor now, families are improvising: pulling trusted bankers into newly created offices, experimenting with incentive packages, and relying heavily on headhunters and word of mouth, he said.",

    "description": "From Glassdoor's \"fatigue\" to Oxford Dictionary's \"rage bait,\" the words of 2025 is reflecting a sense of exhaustion and inability to opt-out.",
    "fullText": "Various platforms and dictionaries released their word of the year in December, and the choices widely reflect a sense of inescapable uncertainty, exhaustion, and skepticism of the tech world.\n\n\"There's no denying that 2025 has been a year defined by questions around who we truly are,\" said Casper Grathwohl, President of Oxford Languages, \"both online and offline.\"\n\nFrom early-career job seekers stuck in unemployment, to social media content that never seems to advance the conversation, and workers struggling to keep up with AI, here is a list of words that dictionaries and culture-watchers say encapsulate the zeitgeist of 2025.\n\nWorkers are tired, according to job search platform Glassdoor.\n\nThe site that allows workers to post reviews of companies they have worked for or interviewed with coined \"fatigue\" as its word of the year, after the term saw a 41% spike in mentions across the platform in 2025.\n\nGlassdoor cited how job seekers are growing increasingly frustrated with endless applications that go nowhere, and how emotionally exhausted workers are with the rapid rise of AI.\n\nWhen Glassdoor asked professionals if they felt like the news cycle was draining their energy at work, 78% said yes. On top of that, job seekers are becoming increasingly frustrated as more \"job huggers\" hold onto their positions in a low-hire, low-fire job market.\n\nIn an ironic admonition, Glassdoor wrote, \"Yes, things could be better, but they could also be much worse.\"\n\n\"Vibe coding,\" a term coined by Andrej Karpathy, a prominent AI researcher, refers to the use of natural language prompts to instruct AI to write computer code instead of writing it from scratch.\n\nCollins said that its word of the year and its contenders mark a \"further shift towards a tech-dominated world.\"\n\nAccording to OpenAI's annual enterprise report, code-related queries increased 36% for workers whose primary job is not engineering. Companies like Anthropic also said that its in-house AI, Claude, is now writing 90% of code for its teams.\n\nIf you ever feel so angry over online content that you feel compelled to repost it and give the comment section a piece of your mindyou may have encountered the Oxford Dictionary's word of the year: \"rage bait.\"\n\nOxford defined the word as \"online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement.\"\n\nAccording to Oxford's data, the use of \"rage bait\" has tripled in 2025 compared to the year before, hinting at \"a deeper shift in how we talk about attention — both how it is given and how it is sought after.\"\n\nMany people seem unable to quit social media. And that could be largely due to \"parasocial\" relationships, which Cambridge Dictionary coined as word of the year.\n\nThe term refers to one-sided \"relationships that people form with celebrities, influencers, and AI chatbots,\" Cambridge Dictionary wrote.\n\nFor example, how fans often feel a deep connection to Taylor Swift's lyrics about heartbreak, to the spontaneity of podcast hosts, and the \"emotionally meaningful\" and \"in some cases troubling\" connection between users and AI chatbots.\n\nBusiness Insider has documented various instances where people become emotionally dependent on an AI model or form long-term relationships with AI girlfriends. The release of AI companions by platforms like Grock, including a flirtatious anime girl, can increase the likelihood of such parasocial relationships.\n\nThe Australian English dictionary chose \"AI slop\" as its top word of the year, highlighting concern over \"low-quality content created by generative AI, often containing errors, and not requested by the user.\"\n\nThe rise of AI-generated content has contributed to longer and more annoying memos at work that don't actually push productivity forward, as well as tricked some news platforms into publishing inaccurate information, such as when the Chicago Sun-Times published an AI-generated summer reading list that matched real authors with books they never wrote.\n\n\"While in recent years we've learnt to become search engineers to find meaningful information, we now need to become prompt engineers in order to wade through the AI slop,\" said the Macquarie Dictionary Committee.\n\nDictionary.com chose a numeral — the number 67 — as its word of the year, for the first time since the site started naming word of the year in 2010.\n\nThe word, pronounced \"six seven\" instead of \"sixty-seven,\" experienced a dramatic rise in search volume since the summer of 2025 and increased more than sixfold since June, said Dictionary.com.\n\nDescribed as \"meaningless, ubiquitous, and nonsensical,\" Dictionary.com said it thinks this word means \"so-so\" or \"maybe this, maybe that,\" which makes some sense if you're rating something a six or seven out of 10.\n\n\"If you're a member of Gen Alpha,\" Dictionary.com added, \"maybe you're smirking at the thought of adults once again struggling to make sense of your notoriously slippery slang.\"",

    "title": "I work in AI security at Google and there are some things I would never tell chatbots. I follow 4 rules to use AI safely.",
    "description": "Harsh Varshney, who works on Chrome AI security at Google, shares four tips for protecting your data and identity when you talk to AI chatbots.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 31-year-old Harsh Varshney, who works at Google and lives in New York. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAI has quickly become a silent partner in our daily lives, and I can't imagine life without AI tools.\n\nDay-to-day, they help me with deep research, note-taking, coding, and online searches.\n\nBut my job means I'm very aware of the privacy concerns associated with using AI. I've worked at Google since 2023 and spent two years as a software engineer on the privacy team, building infrastructure to protect user data. I then switched to the Chrome AI security team, where I help secure Google Chrome from malicious threats, like hackers and those who use AI agents to conduct phishing campaigns.\n\nAI models use data to generate helpful responses, and we users need to protect our private information so that harmful entities, like cybercriminals and data brokers, can't access it.\n\nHere are four habits I've made that I believe are essential for protecting my data while using AI.\n\nSometimes, a false sense of intimacy with AI can lead people to share information online that they never would otherwise. AI companies may have employees who work on improving the privacy aspects of their models, but it's not advisable to share credit card details, Social Security numbers, your home address, personal medical history, or other personally identifiable information with AI chatbots.\n\nDepending on the version being used, the information shared with public AI chatbots can be used to train future models and generate responses that are more relevant. This could result in \"training leakage,\" where the model memorizes personal information about one user and later regurgitates it in responses to another. Plus, there's the risk of data breaches, which would expose what you've shared with a chatbot.\n\nI treat AI chatbots like a public postcard. If I wouldn't write a piece of information on a postcard that could be seen by anyone, I wouldn't share it with a public AI tool. I'm not confident about how my data could be used for future training.\n\nIt's important to identify whether you're using a more public AI tool or an enterprise-grade one.\n\nWhile it's uncertain how conversations are used for training public AI models, companies can pay for \"enterprise\" models. Here, models aren't typically meant to train on user conversations, so it's safer for employees to talk about their work and company projects.\n\nThink of it like having a conversation in a crowded coffee shop where you could be overheard, versus a confidential meeting in your office that stays within the room.\n\nThere have reportedly been instances where employees have accidentally leaked company data to ChatGPT. If you work on unreleased company projects or are trying to get a patent, you probably don't want to discuss your plans with a non-enterprise-grade chatbot due to the risk of leakage.\n\nI don't discuss projects I'm working on at Google with public chatbots. Instead, I use an enterprise model, even for tasks as small as editing a work email. I'm much more comfortable sharing my information because my conversations aren't used for training, but I still minimize the personal information I share.\n\nAI chatbots usually keep a history of your conversations, but I recommend deleting it on both enterprise and public models regularly to protect your user privacy in the long term. Due to the risk of your account being compromised, it's a good precautionary habit to have, even if you're confident you aren't putting private data into the tools.\n\nOnce, I was surprised that an enterprise Gemini chatbot was able to tell me my exact address, even though I didn't remember sharing it. It turned out, I had previously asked it to help me refine an email, which included my address. Because the tool has long-term memory features, enabling it to remember information from previous conversations, it could identify what my address was and retain it.\n\nSometimes, if I'm searching for things I don't want the chatbot to remember, I'll use a special mode, a bit like incognito mode, where the bots don't store my history or use the information to train models. ChatGPT and Gemini call this the \"temporary chat\" feature.\n\nIt's better to use AI tools that are well-known and are more likely to have clear privacy frameworks and other guardrails in place.\n\nOther than Google's products, I like to use OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude.\n\nIt's also helpful to review the privacy policies of any tools you use. Sometimes, they'll explain more about how your data is used to train the model. In the privacy settings, you can also look for a section with the option to \"improve the model for everyone.\" By making sure that setting is turned off, you're preventing your conversations from being used for training.\n\nAI technology is incredibly powerful, but we must be cautious to ensure our data and identities are safe when we use it.\n\nDo you have a story to share about using AI to help you at work?

    "description": "My husband and I aren't posting photos of our son's face on social media. We understand why other people do, but this is what's right for us.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after my son was born earlier this year, my husband and I began gearing ourselves up for a potentially awkward talk with loved ones. Parents, siblings, and friends had come to meet our first baby, and naturally, they took a lot of photos. And while we knew they were eager to boast about their new grandson, nephew, or cousin, we had decided that we didn't want his face on social media.\n\nAdmittedly, it's been challenging at times — both for us, and for our loved ones. Still, we're confident that the benefits outweigh any drawbacks.\n\nWe think our son should have a say in his digital footprint, and at this stage of his life, we aren't able to ask him whether he's OK with having an online presence. Until he can let us know how he feels about having private moments shared on social media, we don't feel comfortable making that choice for him. We'll revisit the idea of posting pictures of him once he's able to verbally consent to it.\n\nIn her book Sharenthood: Why We Should Think Before We Talk About Our Kids Online, Leah A. Plunkett — a Harvard Law School faculty member who specializes in technology law, digital privacy, and children and family law — detailed how posting photos of your kids online puts them at risk of identity theft, bullying, and harassment. It also begins to build a narrative about them, which detracts from their ability to tell their own story.\n\nIt felt unrealistic to expect that everyone in our son's life would refrain from posting any photos that he's included in. After all, my husband has a very large family — which means a lot of group get-togethers where numerous photos are taken. We didn't want people to feel that they couldn't share a joyful life moment just because our son happened to be in the picture.\n\nSo, we decided to only avoid posting photos where his face — or anything else that could identify him — is visible. (That means we mostly share photos where his back is turned to the camera, or we make sure an emoji has been layered over his face.)\n\nHowever, there are occasional slip-ups. After a family apple-picking excursion, one family member accidentally uploaded a group photo with our son's face in it to Instagram. We didn't stress too much about it or reprimand our loved one immediately in front of the group — after all, we knew they didn't mean any harm. We just followed up with them privately to gently remind them of our policy.\n\nThey felt bad, and took the picture down. These slip-ups have happened a few times since my son was born four months ago, and I'm sure they will continue to happen in the coming years. We can't expect every single person in our lives to remember our rule every time they want to post.\n\nTo be clear, we don't fault or criticize anyone else who does post photos of their kids online. It's only natural to have the urge to share that adorable picture of your little one learning something new or hitting a milestone. Believe me, I get it.\n\nIn fact, I'm not immune to those urges. When we did a professional photo shoot in our home a few weeks after our son was born, I felt pangs of regret that I couldn't share certain pictures online, too.\n\nWhen I do feel the impulse to share recent photos and videos of my son, I turn to our family and friend group texts instead of social media. Those are the people who are most excited to stay up to date on his life, anyway. Plus, we love getting their reactions over text.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know how I would feel if I grew up and discovered there were hundreds of photos and videos from my childhood on the internet. What if I was embarrassed by something my mom or dad shared? Fortunately, my parents never had to make that decision, because these apps didn't exist during my childhood.\n\nAny time I start to wonder if my husband and I are making the right choice — say, when a family member seems disappointed that they can't post a cute selfie with our son — I think about how our little guy might feel 10, 15, or 20 years from now. Is he likely to be upset that we didn't share more, or relieved and grateful? I feel confident it's the latter, but only time will tell.",

    "description": "Though Nigel Williams is looking for AI proficiency, the BlackRock exec shared one part of the application process where the tech doesn't belong.",
    "fullText": "If you want to work at BlackRock, make sure you're using AI — just not too much.\n\nNigel Williams, BlackRock's global head of talent acquisition, said that AI is shifting his hiring priorities, and that fluency with the technology is now key to any strong application. However, he warns against depending on it in the interview process.\n\n\"We want to hire people that are curious, that understand that AI is here,\" he told Business Insider, especially because it's embedded in functions across the world's biggest asset manager.\n\nThe strongest applicants can demonstrate that they are both digitally native and comfortable with various AI tools, and that they're curious about future capabilities. Young talent is \"upskilling itself to meet the moment,\" Williams said, since applicants without a computer science background often demonstrate AI proficiency. Everyone, he added, will need to have a basic understanding of prompt engineering and how to question AI outputs.\n\n\"In this age of AI, the talent skills that I think we need more than ever are people that are curious, have a questioning mindset, and are willing to not just trust what the model puts out there, but also make sure we're continuing to pressure test that,\" he said. Strong interpersonal and relationship-building skills are also becoming even more important, he said.\n\nWilliams said that his team is figuring out how to assess applicants' AI abilities and is mindful of making sure people without tech backgrounds don't feel intimidated. He's interested in how people use the technology in their personal, academic, or work lives, and said his team is still fine-tuning how to assess that in the interview process.\n\nDespite Williams' new focus on how applicants engage with AI, he's not using it to screen candidates. As of now, he uses AI to schedule interviews.\n\nThere's such a thing as too much AI in the application process, though.\n\nWilliams said recruiters and hiring managers have told people ahead of an interview not to use an AI tool, sometimes to little avail.\n\n\"It is quite common. You will sometimes see people looking to the left or the right. Our interviewing teams, if they're in the middle of doing that, will pick up on that and be able to say, 'Hey, we do want to make sure that you're staying focused,'\" Williams said.\n\nBlackRock employs around 24,600 people in more than 30 countries, according to a November 5 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some 21,100 people worked at the firm as of the end of 2024, according to that year's annual report.\n\nBlackRock has launched Asimov, an agentic AI platform for its equity business. At the annual New York Times DealBook Summit this week, its CEO, Larry Fink, said that there will be \"some huge winners and huge failures\" with the technology.",

    "description": "Zahydie Burgos's parents moved into the home she shares with her husband after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at 46.",
    "fullText": "This story is based on a conversation with Zahydie Burgos, 41, a licensed psychologist from Orlando. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy husband, Francisco — known as Pako — has always been professional, kind, and considerate to everyone.\n\nHowever, in the fall of 2020, I began to notice changes in his behavior, including skipping meals, struggling to find the right words in conversation, and difficulties managing his finances.\n\nI called him the human calculator because he had been in charge of our income and outgoings from before we got married in 2010, but all of a sudden, he would buy strange things.\n\nWe're not into hockey, but he'd go on the internet and buy tons of hockey merchandise that we'd never wear. \"It's on sale,\" he told me. Amazon trucks drove up to our house three or four times a day.\n\nHe also ordered expensive artwork online. It was costing a fortune, and we were running out of walls to hang it on.\n\nPako worked as a lawyer for the federal government, but despite being one of the strongest candidates on paper for promotion, he'd fall short during the interview.\n\nInitially, I attributed it to the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. We thought it was depression, and I got him the best psychiatrist and a therapist. Even though the psychiatrist changed his medication around 15 times, nothing worked, and he was getting worse.\n\nIf he were making an appointment over the phone, the other person would likely become impatient because he had difficulty explaining what he wanted.\n\nOnce, he was due to meet me at a doctor's office, where we often went. It should have been a 10-minute drive, but he got terribly lost. He stopped the car to describe his surroundings, and I was able to guide him there.\n\nI'd been his princess for 17 years, but he changed the way he communicated with me. He'd snap at me. We had never fought before. \"This shouldn't happen in a marriage,\" I thought.\n\nThen, during the last week of December 2021, he went to an eye appointment. The doctor called and said, \"You need to come in.\" He'd detected an abnormality and thought Pako might have a brain tumor.\n\nWe took him for an MRI and, to our relief, it wasn't a tumor. However, there was bad news. The scan showed that his brain was atrophied and looked like that of an 80-year-old man.\n\nThey said we needed to see a neurologist as soon as possible. She studied the scans and the reports from Pako's psychiatrist and therapist. Then she asked if his judgment had changed. I explained the issues from the past year or so.\n\nShe diagnosed him with Alzheimer's disease on January 28, 2022. I was a hot mess; in denial. l said, \"How can that be? He's only 46.\" She explained that it was an early onset.\n\nPako's face was frozen, then he said, \"I knew it.\" His father died from Alzheimer's in 2012 at the age of 70. He'd watched his decline.\n\nThe diagnosis was confirmed at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore after Pako underwent tests, including a lumbar puncture. His condition was genetic.\n\nWe informed only his eldest brother, a cardiologist, and my parents. We needed a year of mostly silence to grieve in our own way. I must have cried every day.\n\nStill, we were encouraged by breakthroughs in the treatment of Alzheimer's in its early stages. Pako, now 50, has been on a medication named Lequembi since the spring of 2023. He has also participated in a clinical trial of a drug called Etalanetug for the last two years.\n\nThere wasn't even a conversation before Mom and Dad, who retired in their 60s, moved into our house in Orlando. They relocated from their home in Puerto Rico soon after the diagnosis.\n\nMy 74-year-old father, Roberto, walks 30,000 steps a day. He says that he wants to stay fit to support Pako and me. It's mostly due to my parents that I can work full-time, while also caring for my husband whenever possible.\n\nHe can feed and bathe himself, even though he is progressing. He requires supervision, especially when he is outside the house, where there are no cameras to monitor him.\n\nMy parents are very respectful of boundaries and refrain from intervening in his affairs. But they make sure he is eating or taking his medication when I'm not there.\n\nWe felt it was time to share the news with the rest of our family in February 2023. They became our village. Pako's siblings visit often to spend time with him and take care of appointments I'm unable to attend. His 85-year-old mom calls every day from Puerto Rico.\n\nMembers of the family have even joined us on our \"bucket list\" tours to ensure we make the most of every moment together. We've visited places such as Athens, Greece, and Venice, Italy.\n\nPako's diagnosis has upended our lives, but it has also been empowering. I advocate for carers like us, people with Alzheimer's, and raise awareness about early detection via Us Against Alzheimer's.\n\nMost of all, I'm grateful for the support of our relatives who have made sacrifices for Pako and me. Their love and dedication mean a great deal.",

    "title": "Ukraine's drone schools are rewriting their lessons constantly, sometimes every other week as front-line fighting evolves",
    "description": "Ukraine's drone schools are preparing soldiers to take on Russia and working to keep pace with an ever-changing fight.",
    "fullText": "The Ukrainian drone schools training operators for war are having to rewrite their lessons as fast as every other week to get students ready for an ever-changing battlefield.\n\nWithin the drone battle, a critically important aspect of this war, tech and tactics are shifting rapidly. Three drone schools told Business Insider that it's imperative they keep their lessons up to date because it's life or death on the battlefield.\n\nTo maintain relevance and the tactical edge, the instructors are visiting the front regularly, keeping in touch with former students, and testing out new technology to shape their curriculum.\n\nTetyana, a Ukrainian veteran who goes by the call sign \"Ruda\" and is now the head of R&D for Dronarium, a drone training school with sites in Kyiv and Lviv, told Business Insider that changes sometimes take place every two weeks.\n\nAt the front, the evolution of technology is \"moving forward at a very fast pace.\" It means that \"also we have to be very fast in our adaptability.\"\n\nDmytro Slediuk, head of the education department at Dronarium, told BI that \"we continuously make changes to our training programs.\"\n\nFor the most part, he said, no two lectures on the same subject are exactly the same; something is always changing. Over 16,000 students have trained at the school. Their comments and experiences are reflected in the training program curriculum, Slediuk said. Instructors also visit the front lines, and service members come to the school, where they deliver insight into the latest in warfighting.\n\nThere are also group chats with soldiers, Tetyana said. It's two-way communication, with soldiers sharing front-line feedback and instructors providing guidance and advice.\n\nVitalii Pervak, CEO of another training school, Karlsson, Karas & Associates, said that it is absolutely vital that schools teach what is informed by and needed for the field.\n\n\"We do not teach things that will not be necessary in combat,\" he said. \"We constantly update our instructors' knowledge,\" occasionally with visits to the front to \"see firsthand what has changed, what remains relevant, and what can be discarded.\"\n\nViktor Taran, the CEO of the Kruk Drones UAV training center, told Business Insider that all students are in group chats with their instructors, and that connection is preserved after the training is complete. \"Cadets go to the front line, type questions in those chats, or provide information about new enemy tactics.\"\n\nNew information is added to the courses, with some topics updated every three months, he said.\n\nDrone strikes are responsible for most front-line hits and casualties, with both sides using them in lieu of traditional weaponry.\n\nThe result is constant modifications to how they are used and their tactics, as well as the drones themselves, with new types frequently entering the battlefield.\n\nLuke Pollard, the UK's armed forces minister, said this year that Western militaries risk becoming outdated. He said drone warfare is evolving so fast that \"we have to fundamentally challenge our assumptions.\"\n\nHe said that drone technology in Ukraine \"iterates every two to three weeks on the front line,\" while NATO militaries \"build and procure really expensive high-end bits of kit. And it will take you five, 10 years: five years to run a procurement challenge, another 10 years to build it.\" At that rate, the system may already be obsolete by the time it's ready for war.\n\nDefense companies watching Ukraine can see the speed of change, too, and are moving quickly to make changes. Matt McCrann, CEO of the US arm of Droneshield, a company making counter-drone systems for the US and Europe, recently told Business Insider that weapon development cycles are shifting from months and years to weeks.\n\nCompanies are regularly engaging in approaches similar to the drone schools — chats with soldiers and even front-line visits — to keep their understanding of warfighting demands up to date. Some companies have previously told BI that the ways Ukrainians are using tech have come as a surprise, so that communication and engagement are critical.\n\nGediminas Guoba, the CEO of Lithuanian company Granta Autonomy, which has drones in Ukraine, told Business Insider over the summer that he visits the battlefield himself \"just to understand how it really works\" and see what changes need to be made to its products to keep them relevant.\n\nAnd it's beneficial for soldiers too, sparking faster iteration. Ukrainian drone operators have told Business Insider that they keep in touch with companies making their drones to give them feedback on how they can be improved, as well as to get things like replacement parts.\n\nFrom the companies making drones to the troops using them to the schools training operators, everyone is rushing to maintain the edge, but the schools are not simply fighting to stay on top of changes. Targeted by Russian attacks and often seeking donations to help fund the training, they're fighting for survival as well.",

    "description": "I struggled after giving birth to my son, so I was thankful to be living with my mother. She took care of my newborn and me without any judgment.",
    "fullText": "I always imagined postpartum life as something I could manage with a bit of determination and the new glow of motherly instinct. But I realized I was wrong when I had my baby at 24.\n\nI didn't go through the whole nesting process. My hormones didn't entice me to establish a homely space with my partner. In reality, I felt unprepared and unsure.\n\nWhat I truly wanted was to be with my mom. How else was I supposed to survive the most fragile chapter of my life? Moving into my mom's house with my partner and our newborn son was a no-brainer.\n\nIt didn't just give us a roof over our heads; it completely reshaped the way I viewed multigenerational living.\n\nIf my mom hadn't been there — literally in the next room, ready to step in before I even knew that I needed help — I don't know how my life would look today.\n\nAfter giving birth, I struggled. I felt like I was drifting. I didn't want to leave the house, take my son for walks, or even leave my bed. I struggled to come to terms with the fact that life had changed, and I wasn't the same person anymore. Despite the immense love I had for my baby, everything felt dim. There was a strange mix of tenderness and numbness.\n\nWhile I was dealing with my own internal struggles, my partner tried his best, despite the fact that he was also overwhelmed and unsure of what he was doing. My mum immediately became the steady rhythm on days that felt chaotic and unpredictable.\n\nShe noticed things I didn't know how to voice — new mom anxieties that I hid behind smiles, moments when my strength was wearing thin. She didn't ask for explanations or lecture me on how to cope. She simply showed up, again and again, filling the gaps with patience, love, and practical help.\n\nShe cooked meals for us every single day, making sure we ate even when we were too tired to think about food. She took my son two or three nights a week in the beginning, giving my partner and me a chance to have uninterrupted sleep. She bottle-fed him, rocked him, and soothed him. She loved him with the same tenderness she showed my brothers and me when we were babies.\n\nBath time became her ritual. She handled it with ease and warmth, cooing gently at my son while he kicked the water, his tiny face recognising the woman who played a huge role in raising him. Watching her care for him reminded me that I wasn't alone, that being a mother didn't mean I had to carry every weight myself.\n\nEvery milestone he hit, like eating solids, teething, and potty training, she knew exactly what to do and was always on hand for a demonstration or advice. I never had to overthink things or worry about doing the wrong thing. She was always right beside me.\n\nMost importantly, she reminded me that needing support didn't make me a lesser mother. In her presence, I felt safe.\n\nI remember reading an article in The Atlantic about how the idea of a nuclear family structure is a mistake, and I wholeheartedly agree.\n\nHow did we go from the old dynamic of \"all hands on deck\" — grandparents and grandchildren living in the same household with other family members — to the fragmented and somewhat fragile unit of just mom, dad, and children?\n\nI'm so glad I didn't fall for that narrative in my son's early years.\n\nSpreading out parenting responsibilities reinforces a sense of community, allowing me to actually bond with my baby without collapsing under pressure, and to slowly grow into motherhood with support rather than fear. I was healthy and happy, and above all, my baby was too.\n\nLittle by little, I came to understand that parenting isn't meant to be a solitary endeavor; when they say it takes a village, they mean it.",

    "fullText": "Larne manager Gary Haveron has praised the match-winning contribution of forward Benji Magee, who came off the bench to score a brilliant goal eight minutes from time to secure a 1-0 victory over Glentoran at Inver Park on Friday night.\n\nThe moment of individual brilliance from the former Loughgall front man saw him drift away from Cameron Palmer and rifle a low drive past Andrew Mills from just outside the penalty area.\n\nThe victory has the Invermen level on points with Coleraine at the top of the table, trailing only on goal difference, but with two games in hand over the leaders.\n\n\"It needed something to kick-start the game. It never really caught fire but Benji came up with that moment and that's what he's capable of,\" said Haveron.\n\n\"We know that, we see Benji do that on a regular basis. When you see some of the things he does in training it's no surprise when he pops up and produces that bit of brilliance in the game.\n\n\"That was the bit of quality the game was probably lacking. We've had a really tough run of games but 10 points out of 12 from fixtures against Coleraine, Dungannon Swifts, Linfield and Glentoran is a super return by the boys.\n\n\"It was always going to be small margins in a game like this so delighted to get three points and we move on.\"\n\nHaveron was satisfied with the way his side combatted the threat posed by their opponents in the first meeting between the sides this season.\n\n\"It's hard to play against the Glens, they're so long and direct and they stretch the game. They press up behind the long ball. That's a style that really works for them as they've got a great striker in Pat Hoban who can hold the ball up and they can get players up around him.\n\n\"They've got that very direct style that you've got to combat.\n\n\"It's more difficult for us because we're trying to play the ball out from the back, move the ball quickly across the back and play up through the thirds but we lacked that little bit of connection between midfield and attack.\n\n\"We got in behind them a couple of times in the first half but we never did the same in the second. We never had that threat. But they asked a lot of questions and we had the answers.\"\n\nLarne remain unbeaten at home this season in the league, their last hone defat on their own patch coming against Dungannon back in February.\n\n\"Keeping this place tight is really key for us. I hate conceding goals with an absolute passion and we're a hard team to break down. We stick at it.\"\n\nDD: \"We have to look at ourselves in terms of not taking opportunities. We've dominated the game against a good side away from home at a difficult venue.\n\n\"We've given up one opportunity in the game and we've got punished, yet we've created four or five good chances and not taken them.\n\n\"It's a very difficult time for us at the moment because our performances haven't been bad in recent games but our points tally has been poor. There's no shying away from that.\n\n\"You can have all the domination that you want but at the end of the day it comes down to having three points in the bag. You've got to put that ball in the back of the net.\n\n\"I know we're really close to being a really good side, I think we'll still be in the mix, and we don't fear anyone in the league but we've got to tidy up and make sure we are more ruthless, have more cohesion about us in terms of digging out a clean sheet.\n\n\"We can't fall further behind.\"\n\n\"We've gone behind in the last five games so when you give away that first goal it's extremely hard to come away with three points.\n\n\"We wanted to send our supporters home happy as they were magnificent for us. The players are distraught because it was a game we didn't deserve to lose.\"",

I'm so happy.\"\n\nHurricanes finished top of the table to reach their first WBBL final directly, and victory here means Melbourne Stars are the only side yet to win the competition since it began in 2015.\n\nThe hosts displayed some nerves early on against the 2021 champions, with Mooney dropped three times in the first three overs, albeit all off tough chances.\n\nHowever, the leading runscorer in this year's tournament was unable to punish Hobart. With scoring stalling, Mooney backed away to try and hit Heather Graham down the ground and was bowled for 33 off 26 balls.\n\nAfter Smith removed England team-mate Freya Kemp for 10, Scorchers captain Sophie Devine made 34 off 29 before she was lured down the track and stumped off Graham.\n\nEngland's Paige Scholfield struck an unbeaten 27 off 22 late on but Scorchers' total looked well below par.\n\nLee and England's Danni Wyatt-Hodge affirmed that was the case as they raced to 49-0 off just five overs in reply.\n\nWyatt-Hodge was bowled by Amy Edgar two balls later, but wicketkeeper Lee flicked the switch and started dispatching the bowlers to all parts of the ground.\n\nShe brought up a 32-ball fifty with a mighty flat six over mid-wicket, following it up with a four down the ground and a sublime lofted drive over extra cover for six.\n\nSciver-Brunt picking out mid-wicket proved a mere consolation wicket, with Carey settling a one-sided final in the next over.\n\n\"Full congratulations to the Hurricanes, they absolutely outplayed us,\" said New Zealand skipper Devine.\n\nIt is the second WBBL in a row to be won by a maiden champion after Melbourne Renegades picked up their first title last year.\n\nCoverage of the men's Big Bash starts on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app from 14 December.

The England squad were happy to interact with locals and media alike - Stokes even posed with two radio presenters dressed in full whites carrying signs that read: \"For sale - moral victories\" and \"Bazballers anonymous - free counselling\".\n\nAustralian newspapers have paid close attention to England's downtime. The Brisbane Courier Mail claimed England are \"not even trying anymore\", the Advertiser from Adelaide labelled the tourists \"rub a dub duds\" and Sydney's Daily Telegraph carried the headline \"Surfed and Turfed\".\n\nFormer Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie told ABC radio: \"The tourism commission will be licking their lips. It's been Noosa, Noosa, Noosa.\n\n\"There's been a lot of criticism about the England team having a break. I don't have a problem with it. I think it's absolutely fair and reasonable.\"\n\nEngland's decision to take the break in Noosa has continued the debate around their preparation and training on the tour of Australia.\n\nBilled as a huge opportunity for England to earn a rare win down under and the most anticipated Ashes for a generation, this series is at risk of being over at the earliest opportunity.\n\nDefeat in the second Test in Brisbane extended England's winless run in Australia to 17 Tests, dating back to their last series win here in 2010-11. If they do not win in Adelaide, this will be the fourth consecutive Ashes down under that the destination of the urn will have been settled inside three matches.\n\nEngland were criticised for playing only one warm-up match before the first Test - a three-day match against the second-string England Lions.\n\nThe decision not to send any players from the first Test XI to join a Lions pink-ball match against the Prime Minister's XI in Canberra also came under scrutiny.\n\nEngland instead opted for five days of training before the second Test, which head coach Brendon McCullum claimed left them \"overprepared\" for the defeat at the Gabba.",

    "description": "Tips from an AI skeptic for working with a team which uses AI a lot.",
    "fullText": "So your team uses AI a lot. Maybe you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed by the amount of bad code, or just the volume of code, you’re having to review. I’ve been there too. While AI has gained popularity, I’ve worked with many teams in many industries. Here are some techniques and strategies I’ve adopted, as an AI skeptic, which have made reviewing AI generated code feel less taxing and more productive.\n\nBefore digging into what’s different, I think it’s worth taking a moment to recognize what’s the same. These things are true whether your PR was written by a human or an AI.\n\nTesting is software engineering, but is often viewed as less important by both humans and AI alike. The author may not have reviewed the tests as closely as the implementation. It’s well worth your time as a reviewer to make up that difference.\n\nSomething I try to keep in mind when reviewing AI-generated PRs, and honestly in life, is that perfect is the enemy of good. Not every comment will be resolved exactly how you’d prefer. Sometimes you’ll let things slide that you wish you hadn’t. But steady, incremental influence still matters. A review that nudges the codebase in the right direction is far better than disengaging and letting low-quality AI output accumulate unchecked. If you stay involved, ask questions, and keep the conversation open with your teammates and leadership, you retain the ability to shape the outcome.\n\nFinally, it’s worth remembering that advice like this only gets you so far. If your team is consistently flooding the codebase with poor AI-generated code, that’s ultimately not a tooling problem, it’s a people and process problem. Technology tends to amplify whatever dynamics already exist. The real work is helping the team move toward better habits and shared expectations. No one is trying to write bad code; they’re doing the best they know how. Thoughtful guidance, clear standards, and collaborative review are how you help them know better—and do better.\n\nWe've been helping engineering teams deliver exceptional products for over 20 years. Our designers, developers, and product managers work closely with teams to solve your toughest software challenges through collaborative design and development. Learn more about us.",

    "title": "We Built Another Object Storage (and Why It's Different)",
    "description": "High-performance object storage exists, but the economics make it unusable at scale. FractalBits breaks out of the high-performance trap.",
    "fullText": "Object storage is the backbone of modern data infrastructure. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MinIO, Ceph, newer players like Tigris Data—the market is saturated. So why build another one?\n\nBecause the fundamental assumptions behind these systems are shifting. High performance is no longer optional—but having high performance available isn’t the same as being able to afford using it.\n\nTraditional object storage had a clear priority order: cost first, performance later. This worked fine for archiving backups and storing large, rarely accessed files.\n\nBut today, object storage is increasingly the primary data layer for AI, analytics, and cloud-native applications. Latency directly translates to compute costs—stalled GPUs waiting on I/O are expensive GPUs doing nothing.\n\nHigh-performance object storage exists now. S3 Express One Zone, for example, delivers single-digit millisecond latency. But there’s a catch: the per-request pricing makes it prohibitively expensive to actually use at high IOPS. As one analysis put it, it’s “the right technology, at the right time with the wrong price” [1]. You have the performance on paper, but you can’t afford to run your workload at full speed. That’s the high-performance trap.\n\nModern workloads, especially in AI, impose demands that strain traditional designs:\n\nSmall Objects at Scale: AI training datasets often consist of millions of small files (images, text snippets, feature vectors). A study of typical AI training workloads found over 60% of objects are 512KB or smaller [2]. This shifts the bottleneck from bandwidth to metadata performance.\n\nLatency Sensitivity: Training loops and inference pipelines are bottlenecked by I/O. When fetching thousands of small objects per batch, per-object latency compounds quickly, stalling expensive GPUs.\n\nThe Need for Directories: S3’s flat namespace is a mismatch for many workflows. Data scientists expect atomic renames and efficient directory listings—operations that are either slow or missing in classic object stores.\n\nA reasonable question: if you want directories and atomic rename, why not just use a filesystem like AWS EFS? Object stores and filesystems are different concepts—why blur the line?\n\nThe answer is that the line is already blurring, driven by real workload demands. AWS themselves recognized this when they introduced S3 Express One Zone with explicit “directory bucket” semantics and atomic rename support (currently single-object) [3]. Google Cloud has made similar moves toward hierarchical namespace support [4]. The industry is converging on this because the clean separation between “object storage for scale” and “filesystem for semantics” doesn’t match how modern applications actually work.\n\nWe’re not trying to build a POSIX filesystem. But the subset of filesystem semantics that matter for data workflows—efficient directory listings, atomic rename for safe data handoffs—these belong in object storage. The alternative is forcing every application to build fragile workarounds on top of a flat namespace.\n\nExisting systems struggle with these patterns in predictable ways:\n\nThe High-Performance Trap: High-performance tiers like S3 Express One Zone solve the latency problem, but the per-request cost means you can’t actually use that performance at scale. At 10K PUT/s, you’re looking at ~$29K/month in request fees alone. The performance is there; the economics aren’t.\n\nThe Small Object Tax: With cloud object storage, you pay per request. Storing billions of 4KB objects means your API request costs can exceed your storage costs. The more objects you have, the worse it gets.\n\nMissing Directory Semantics: The lack of atomic rename forces complex workarounds in applications, limiting what you can build directly on object storage. Most systems with rename support rely on inode-like structures that struggle with scalability and performance—adding to the per-IOPS cost burden.\n\nWe built FractalBits to break out of the high-performance trap: delivering performance you can actually afford to use at scale. In our benchmarks, we achieved nearly 1M GET/s on 4KB objects with a cluster totaling 64 cores across all data and metadata nodes.\n\nHere’s what the gap looks like for a small-object intensive workload (4KB objects, 10K IOPS):\n\nS3 costs based on public pricing ($0.00113/1K PUTs, $0.00003/1K GETs, $0.11/GB/Month). FractalBits estimated using 1-year reserved instance pricing for required compute (e.g., i8g.2xlarge for data, m7g.4xlarge for metadata). Your savings will vary based on workload, but the magnitude is indicative.\n\nAt our core is a metadata engine built on an on-disk radix tree, optimized for path-like keys.\n\nMost object stores use LSM-trees (good for writes, variable read latency) or B+ trees (predictable reads, write amplification). We chose a radix tree because it naturally mirrors a filesystem hierarchy:\n\nPrefix Sharing: Common path segments (e.g., /datasets/cifar10/) are stored once, saving memory and speeding up traversal.\n\nEfficient Directory Operations: Listing a directory becomes a subtree scan. Atomic rename is essentially updating a pointer at the branch point, not copying data.\n\nCrash Consistency: We use physiological logging to ensure metadata integrity and fast recovery.\n\nUnlike most systems that use inode-based (or inode-like) structures to support directory features, we use a full-path approach for better scalability and performance.\n\nWhy Zig?\n\nOur S3-compatible API server, built in Rust, manages the data path:\n\nSafety & Concurrency: Rust’s ownership model gives us thread safety without a garbage collector—important for high-concurrency request handling.\n\nAsync I/O: Built on Tokio for handling thousands of concurrent connections.\n\nProduction-Ready Frameworks: We support both axum and actix-web, defaulting to actix-web. Its thread-per-core architecture aligns with our design for maximum performance.\n\nFractalBits deploys as a managed software layer within your own cloud account (currently AWS only).\n\nFor us: We leverage the cloud’s proven infrastructure instead of building it from scratch, letting us focus on the storage engine itself.\n\nThe object storage market has high-performance options, but the economics often make that performance unusable at scale. And systems that do offer directory semantics often struggle with performance or scalability. Getting both at a reasonable cost is still rare. We think there’s room for a different approach.\n\nFractalBits is our answer. We’re early in this journey and learning from users who are pushing these limits.\n\nHitting the performance or cost wall with your current object storage? We’d be interested to hear about your use case.\n\n[1].

    "description": "Learn how to create a MySQL user, grant privileges, and manage database access. Step-by-step guide with SQL commands and security best practices.",
    "fullText": "MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is commonly deployed as part of the LAMP stack (which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) and, as of this writing, is the most popular open-source database in the world.\n\nThis guide outlines how to create a new MySQL user and grant them the permissions needed to perform a variety of actions.\n\nIn order to follow along with this guide, you’ll need access to a MySQL database. This guide assumes that this database is installed on a virtual private server running Ubuntu 20.04, though the principles it outlines should be applicable regardless of how you access your database.\n\nIf you don’t have access to a MySQL database and would like to set one up yourself, you can follow one of our guides on How To Install MySQL. Again, regardless of your server’s underlying operating system, the methods for creating a new MySQL user and granting them permissions will generally be the same.\n\nYou could alternatively spin up a MySQL database managed by a cloud provider. For details on how to spin up a DigitalOcean Managed Database, see our product documentation.\n\nPlease note that any portions of example commands that you need to change or customize will be highlighted like this throughout this guide.\n\nUpon installation, MySQL creates a root user account which you can use to manage your database. This user has full privileges over the MySQL server, meaning it has complete control over every database, table, user, and so on. Because of this, it’s best to avoid using this account outside of administrative functions. This step outlines how to use the root MySQL user to create a new user account and grant it privileges.\n\nIn Ubuntu systems running MySQL 5.7 (and later versions), the root MySQL user is set to authenticate using the auth_socket plugin by default rather than with a password. This plugin requires that the name of the operating system user that invokes the MySQL client matches the name of the MySQL user specified in the command. This means that you need to precede the mysql command with sudo to invoke it with the privileges of the root Ubuntu user in order to gain access to the root MySQL user:\n\nNote: If your root MySQL user is configured to authenticate with a password, you will need to use a different command to access the MySQL shell. The following will run your MySQL client with regular user privileges, and you will only gain administrator privileges within the database by authenticating with the correct password:\n\nOnce you have access to the MySQL prompt, you can create a new user with a CREATE USER statement. These follow this general syntax:\n\nAfter CREATE USER, you specify a username. This is immediately followed by an @ sign and then the hostname from which this user will connect. If you only plan to access this user locally from your Ubuntu server, you can specify localhost. Wrapping both the username and host in single quotes isn’t always necessary, but doing so can help to prevent errors.\n\nYou have several options when it comes to choosing your user’s authentication plugin. The auth_socket plugin mentioned previously can be convenient, as it provides strong security without requiring valid users to enter a password to access the database. But it also prevents remote connections, which can complicate things when external programs need to interact with MySQL.\n\nAs an alternative, you can leave out the WITH authentication_plugin portion of the syntax entirely to have the user authenticate with MySQL’s default plugin, caching_sha2_password. The MySQL documentation recommends this plugin for users who want to log in with a password due to its strong security features.\n\nRun the following command to create a user that authenticates with caching_sha2_password. Be sure to change sammy to your preferred username and password to a strong password of your choosing:\n\nNote: There is a known issue with some versions of PHP that causes problems with caching_sha2_password. If you plan to use this database with a PHP application — phpMyAdmin, for example — you may want to create a user that will authenticate with the older, though still secure, mysql_native_password plugin instead:\n\nIf you aren’t sure, you can always create a user that authenticates with caching_sha2_plugin and then ALTER it later on with this command:\n\nAfter creating your new user, you can grant them the appropriate privileges.\n\nThe general syntax for granting user privileges is as follows:\n\nThe PRIVILEGE value in this example syntax defines what actions the user is allowed to perform on the specified database and table. You can grant multiple privileges to the same user in one command by separating each with a comma. You can also grant a user privileges globally by entering asterisks (*) in place of the database and table names. In SQL, asterisks are special characters used to represent “all” databases or tables.\n\nTo illustrate, the following command grants a user global privileges to CREATE, ALTER, and DROP databases, tables, and users, as well as the power to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data from any table on the server. It also grants the user the ability to query data with SELECT, create foreign keys with the REFERENCES keyword, and perform FLUSH operations with the RELOAD privilege. However, you should only grant users the permissions they need, so feel free to adjust your own user’s privileges as necessary.\n\nYou can find the full list of available privileges in the official MySQL documentation.\n\nRun this GRANT statement, replacing sammy with your own MySQL user’s name, to grant these privileges to your user:\n\nNote that this statement also includes WITH GRANT OPTION. This will allow your MySQL user to grant any permissions that it has to other users on the system.\n\nWarning: Some users may want to grant their MySQL user the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege, which will provide them with broad superuser privileges akin to the root user’s privileges, like so:\n\nSuch broad privileges should not be granted lightly, as anyone with access to this MySQL user will have complete control over every database on the server.\n\nMany guides suggest running the FLUSH PRIVILEGES command immediately after a CREATE USER or GRANT statement in order to reload the grant tables to ensure that the new privileges are put into effect:\n\nHowever, according to the official MySQL documentation, when you modify the grant tables indirectly with an account management statement like GRANT, the database will reload the grant tables immediately into memory, meaning that the FLUSH PRIVILEGES command isn’t necessary in our case. On the other hand, running it won’t have any negative effect on the system.\n\nIf you need to revoke a permission, the structure is almost identical to granting it:\n\nNote that when revoking permissions, the syntax requires that you use FROM, instead of TO which you used when granting the permissions.\n\nYou can review a user’s current permissions by running the SHOW GRANTS command:\n\nJust as you can delete databases with DROP, you can use DROP to delete a user:\n\nAfter creating your MySQL user and granting them privileges, you can exit the MySQL client:\n\nIn the future, to log in as your new MySQL user, you’d use a command like the following:\n\nThe -p flag will cause the MySQL client to prompt you for your MySQL user’s password in order to authenticate.\n\nTo remove a MySQL user, you can use the DROP USER command. The syntax for this command is as follows:\n\nReplace username with the actual username you want to remove, and host with the hostname or IP address from which the user can connect. For example, to remove a user named ‘sammy’ who can connect from ‘localhost’, you would use:\n\nAfter executing this command, the specified user will be removed from the MySQL server. Note that this action is irreversible, so make sure to use it with caution and only when you are certain you want to remove the user.\n\nIt’s also important to note that you cannot remove a user who is currently connected to the MySQL server. If you try to do so, you will receive an error message indicating that the user is still connected. You will need to disconnect the user before attempting to remove them.\n\nThe Access denied for user error typically occurs when a user attempts to connect to a MySQL database with incorrect credentials or insufficient privileges. This error can be frustrating, but it’s usually easy to resolve by checking and adjusting the user’s credentials and privileges.\n\nTo fix this error, follow these steps:\n\nVerify user credentials: Ensure that the username, password, and host are correct. Double-check that the username and password are spelled correctly and that the host is set to the correct value (e.g., ‘localhost’, ‘%’, or a specific IP address).\n\nCheck privileges: Ensure that the user has been granted the necessary privileges to access the database. You can do this by running the SHOW GRANTS command to review the user’s current permissions:\n\nThis will display the current privileges granted to the user. If the user lacks the necessary privileges, you can grant them using the GRANT command.\n\nOr, to grant privileges on a specific table:\n\nTo enable remote connections for a user, ensure that the user account is configured to allow connections from the specific host or IP address. This can be done by granting privileges to the user with the correct hostname or IP address. For example:\n\nThis grants all privileges to the user ‘username’ from any host (%).\n\nError 1396 typically occurs when trying to create a user that already exists. To fix this error, ensure that the user does not already exist in the MySQL database. If the user does exist, you can try to modify the existing user account instead of creating a new one. If you want to create a new user with the same name, you can first drop the existing user and then create the new one.\n\nFor example, if you’re trying to create a user named ‘newuser’ but you’re encountering Error 1396, you can first check if the user already exists using the following command:\n\nIf the user exists, you can drop the existing user account using the following command:\n\nAfter dropping the existing user, you can then create the new user account using the following command:\n\nTo create a MySQL user with limited privileges, you need to specify the specific privileges you want to grant to the user when creating the user account. For example, if you want to grant a user only SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE privileges on a specific database, you would use the following command:\n\nThis approach ensures that the user can only perform the specified actions on the specified database, limiting their privileges.\n\nTo check MySQL user permissions, you can use the SHOW GRANTS command. This command displays the privileges granted to a user. The syntax is as follows:\n\nThis command will display all the privileges granted to the specified user.\n\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES grants a user all available privileges on a database or table, whereas specific privileges limit the user’s access to only the specified actions. Granting all privileges can be a security risk, as it gives the user complete control over the database or table. On the other hand, granting specific privileges ensures that the user can only perform the actions necessary for their role, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or changes.\n\nTo allow remote access to a MySQL user, you need to grant privileges to the user with the hostname set to %, which represents any host. For example:\n\nThis grants all privileges to the user from any host, allowing remote access.\n\nTo delete a MySQL user safely, you should first revoke all privileges granted to the user using the REVOKE command. Then, you can drop the user account using the DROP USER command. The syntax is as follows:\n\nThis approach ensures that the user account is removed safely, without leaving any lingering privileges that could be exploited.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "When talking about auth, there seems be a certain group that’s adamant on using middleware to handle authorization. Middleware here refers to functions that run before every request.\n\nI do not like this approach at all.\n\nI’m just confused at this point since you’re just re-implementing routing logic within middleware, an API provided by your routing library. And what do you do when you need to protect routes based on user roles?\n\nWhile route-level middleware (middleware that only applies to certain routes) may help in this simple example, routes in real-world applications aren’t often organized by their required permissions. What happens if you have multiple roles? What if you need to implement different rate-limiting on each route based on user roles? How about API access token permissions and scopes?\n\nAbstractions aren’t the problem here. The issue is that middleware is the wrong abstraction. It’s just the most obvious solution that seems to make sense in a smaller scale.\n\nBut, we first have to answer: Do we need to abstract in the first place?\n\nThis goes beyond this rant but I feel, at least in the JavaScript ecosystem, people seems to go too far on abstractions and “simplicity.” It isn’t surprising given how loosey-goosey powerful JS can be. Auth, which includes both authentication and authorization, seems to be particularly vulnerable to this since people are overtly scared of it. But auth is not an independent system from your application. It’s an integral part of it that affects and is affected by everything else. This makes it extra-hard to abstract without introducing unwanted complexity since it any abstraction that’s useful require some level of flexibility.\n\nGetting back to the middleware discussion, why not just add the auth check on each route?\n\nIf you’re too lazy to write some basic if checks, maybe that’s a you problem. But on a serious note, if you need to abstract, use wrapper functions. This is a much better approach than middleware since you don’t have to worry about routing. I also like that all the logic is defined in a single location instead of scattered across your project.\n\nIf you deal with multiple permission level (e.g. roles, scopes), you can just create a helper function for checking them. Again, abstractions themselves aren’t bad. You just need to implement them at the right level.\n\nThis doesn’t mean middleware is useless. It works for global-level stuff like CSRF protection and providing data to each route. Actually, authenticating requests and passing the user object to each route is a great use of middleware (but letting each route handle authorization). But even then, you should probably replace it once you need to deal with exceptions and multiple patterns.\n\nOne common response I get to this opinion is that using middleware prevents developers from accidentally forgetting to add an auth check. That’s why you test your code. You should be testing your auth logic regardless of your implementation. Given that, adding auth checks to each route is less bug-prone and easier to debug than forcing an abstraction with middleware.",

    "fullText": "The Great Green Wall, officially known as the Three-North Shelter Forest Program (simplified Chinese: 三北防护林; traditional Chinese: 三北防護林; pinyin: Sānběi Fánghùlín), is a series of human-planted windbreaking forest strips (shelterbelts) in China, designed to hold back the expansion of the Gobi Desert[1] and provide timber to the local population.[2] The program started in 1978 and is planned to complete around 2050,[3] at which point it will be expected to have created a vast green barrier spanning approximately 4,828 kilometres (3,000 mi) long and up to 1,448 kilometres (900 mi) wide in certain regions, and will encompass around 88 million acres of forests.[4][5][6]\n\nThe project's name indicates that it is to be carried out in all three northern regions: the North, the Northeast, and the Northwest.[7] This project has historical precedents dating back to before the Common Era. However, in premodern periods, government-sponsored afforestation projects along the historical frontier regions were mostly for military fortification.[8]\n\nChina has the largest desert area of any country and is heavily impacted by sandstorms. However, the country has implemented various measures to restore grasslands and forests, successfully slowing and now reversing overall desertification.[9] In November 2024, China's government reported the completion of the 3,000 km green belt around the Taklamakan Desert. The fraction of the country covered by deserts declined from 27.2% in the previous decade to 26.8%.[10]\n\nInitiated mostly in Northern China, the Great Green Wall of China is a massive reforestation project meant to counteract desertification and slow down the consequences of climate change.[11] Starting in the 1970s in reaction to the Gobi Desert incursion, the project was driven by the Chinese government. Early projects included massive tree planting to stop desertification and safeguard local communities and agricultural territory.[11] Aiming to build a green barrier against desertification, dust storms, and ecological damage,[12] the government started the \"Three-North Shelterbelt Program\" in the 2000s. This effort developed over time into the enormous environmental rehabilitation project known today as the Great Green Wall.\n\nDesertification, which involves either human or natural activity changing normal humid areas to dry desert conditions,[13] is a large and increasing problem faced by modern China. 29.7% of China had been desertified by the year 2000, with the rate of change increasing almost every year.[13] In 2003, Worldchanging reported that 3,600 km2 (1,400 sq mi) of Chinese grassland were being overtaken annually by the Gobi Desert.[14] On June 2001, National Geographic reported that annually, the dust storms blow off as much as 2,000 km2 (800 sq mi) of topsoil, and the storms increase in severity. Such storms have serious agricultural impacts on other nearby countries, including Japan, North Korea, and South Korea.[15] The main cause of these changes was human activity, with water usage, mining, excess farming, and wood cutting being the top contributors.[13] In 2022, Time reported progress in desert stabilization and that thousands of acres of shifting dunes had been stabilized, while the nationwide frequency of sandstorms, including those affecting Beijing, had \"especially\" dropped by one-fifth between 2009 and 2014.[16]\n\nIn 2017, National Geographic reported that the policies in place at the time had contributed to the reduction of China's forests and grasslands. One example was the 'grain first' policy, which required grasslands to be converted into croplands.[11] Reducing grass coverage eliminated one of the barriers to desertification. Most of these causes can be attributed to an underlying issue: population growth.[11] The amount of people living in important ecological areas has grown beyond the carrying capacity of those areas.[17] In 2019, a study published in Nature Sustainability, found that while human activity had previously been associated with land degradation, these policies had led to a net increase in vegetated land in China.[18]\n\nIn the past 40 years, the world as a whole has lost a third of its arable land due to desertification.[17] The increasing desertification and related storms have caused some major issues for people living in China, especially around the Gobi desert. Crops and buildings are being damaged or destroyed. This has forced many people, who are now called \"climate refugees\"[17] to leave their homelands. In total, the effects of desertification have affected the lives of over 400 million people.[17] The Green Wall project was begun in 1978, with the proposed result of raising northern China's forest cover from 5 to 15 percent,[19] thereby reducing desertification.\n\nYin Yuzhen planted trees to rehabilitate the desolate environment in the Uxin Banner of China's semi-arid western landscape. Yin's afforestation efforts have been recognized by individuals such as Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, who, during the 2020 National People's Congress, described the actions of those such as Yin as a remarkable achievement and an overall improvement of the ecology in China.[20]\n\nChina has been increasingly installing solar farms in its desert regions including Kubuqi Desert as part of efforts to combat desertification. Listed in its renewable energy plan for 2021 to 2025, China has called for the “large-scale development” of its sand-plus-solar anti-desertification method, a strategy that Beijing began promoting around 2023.[21][22] Solar farms in desert areas contribute to China’s renewable energy capacity while also helping to stabilize the landscape. The shade provided by the solar panels reduces the harsh impact of the sun on the soil, creating more favorable conditions for vegetation to grow. In some instances, grass has started to grow beneath the panels, which aids in reducing soil erosion and supporting the local ecosystem.[23]\n\nAdditionally, solar panels have been documented to lower wind speeds at ground level, helping to prevent the movement of sand dunes and minimizing dust that can degrade the environment.[24] This can lead to better air quality and improved conditions for plant growth, further aiding in the restoration of desertified land. In particular, liquorice plants has proven to be effective in the shaded areas beneath solar panels. As a nitrogen-fixing crop, it draws nitrogen from the air, adds organic matter to the soil, and gradually restores soil fertility. Over time, this helps improve the quality of the land, making it suitable for growing a wider variety of crops, such as tomatoes and melons. The more advanced solar farms in Chinese deserts currently feature elevated solar panels that allow for high-tech farming underneath, often in irrigated greenhouses. This approach combines renewable energy production with agricultural practices, contributing to both ecological restoration and food production. Though challenges such as sand buildup on panels and the costs associated with transporting energy from remote areas remain an issue, overall analysis of Landsat data indicates that solar projects have contributed to the greening of deserts in parts of China in recent years.[23][24]\n\nIn 2008, winter storms destroyed 10% of the new forest stock, causing the World Bank to advise China to focus more on quality rather than quantity in its stock species.[25] By 2009, China's planted forest covered more than 500,000 square kilometers (increasing tree cover from 12% to 18%) – the largest artificial forest in the world.[25]\n\nAccording to Foreign Affairs, the Three-North Shelter Forest Program successfully transitioned the economic model of the Gobi Desert region from harmful farming agriculture to ecological-friendly tourism, fruit business, and forestry.[26]\n\nIn 2018, the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that the increase in forest coverage observed by satellites is consistent with Chinese government data.[27] According to Shixiong Cao, an ecologist at Beijing Forestry University, the Chinese government recognized the water shortages problem in arid regions and changed the approach to plant vegetation with lower water requirements.[27] Zhang Jianlong, head of the forestry department, told the media that the goal was to sustain the health of vegetation and choose suitable plant species and irrigation techniques.[27]\n\nAccording to a 2019 NASA Earth Observatory report, satellite data from 2000 to 2017 showed that China contributed significantly to global greening efforts, primarily through both large-scale afforestation programs and intensive agricultural practices. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data suggested that China accounted for approximately 25% of the global increase in greening, with about 42% of this growth attributed to both forest conservation and expansion efforts aimed at mitigating soil erosion and climate change.[28]\n\nAccording to a BBC News report in 2020, tree plantation programs resulted in significant carbon dioxide absorption and helped mitigate climate change; the benefit of tree planting was underestimated by previous research.[29] The Three-North Shelter Forest Program was also found to have reversed the desertification of the Gobi Desert, which grew 10,000 square kilometers per year in the 1980s, but was shrinking by more than 2,000 square kilometers per year in 2022.[30]\n\nIn November 2024, China's government reported that after 46 years of work it had finished the 3,000-kilometer green belt around the Taklamakan Desert. The country's forest coverage grew from 10% of the overall territory in 1949 to 25% in 2024; the green belt project contributed to this achievement. Although the country's desert coverage was still 26.8% in 2024, this was down slightly from 27.2% a decade previously.[10]\n\nTo date, at least 30 million hectares of trees have been planted.[31] Moreover, the authorities noted a notable decrease in the frequency and intensity of dust storms, especially in places like Beijing.[12] The tree planting has helped to stabilize the soil and enhance the local microclimates, therefore aiding agriculture and stopping more desertification.[12] Though these achievements are noteworthy, they do not allay the continuous worries regarding the ecological sustainability and efficacy of such massive operations.[32]\n\nHong Jiang, a geography professor at the University of Wisconsin, worried trees could soak up large amounts of groundwater, which would be extremely problematic for arid regions like northern China.[33] Dee Williams, a US Department of Interior anthropologist, pointed to China's past failures in anti-desertification efforts and suggested that planting trees is a temporary fix that could not change behavior.[33]\n\nIn December 2003, American futurist Alex Steffen on his website Worldchanging strongly criticized the Green Wall project. He claimed China wasn't using collaborative effort and information platforms to support the local effort. China's increasing levels of pollution have also weakened the soil, causing it to be unusable in many areas.[14]\n\nResearch of reforested areas of the Loess Plateau has found that the combination of exotic tree species and high-density planting could worsen water shortages. The forests increase the loss of soil moisture content when compared to farmland.[34]\n\nFurthermore, planting blocks of fast-growing trees reduces the biodiversity of forested areas, creating areas unsuitable for plants and animals normally found in forests. \"China plants more trees than the rest of the world combined\", says John MacKinnon, the head of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme, \"but the trouble is they tend to be monoculture plantations. They are not places where birds want to live.\" The lack of diversity also makes the trees more susceptible to disease, as in 2000, when one billion poplar trees in Ningxia were lost to a single disease, setting back 20 years of planting efforts.[35] China's forest scientists argued that monoculture tree plantations are more effective at absorbing the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than slow-growth forests,[25] so while diversity may be lower, the trees purportedly help to offset China's carbon emissions.\n\nLiu Tuo, head of the Desertification Control Office in the State Forestry Administration, believed that there are huge gaps in the country's efforts to reclaim the land that has become desert.[36] By 2011, around 1.73 million km2 of land had become desert in China, of which 530,000 km2 was treatable. But, at the 2011 rate of treating 1,717 km2 per year, it would take 300 years to reclaim the land that had become desert.[37]\n\nCritics have also questioned the project's efficacy in stopping the Gobi Desert's spread, noting that the severe arid climate and poor soil quality make it challenging to maintain tree development over the long run.[12] Furthermore, although the initiative has made significant progress in reforestation, it has not adequately addressed the fundamental socioeconomic drivers of desertification, including overgrazing and unsustainable farming methods.[32]",

    "description": "The White House has promised to quadruple nuclear power by 2050.",
    "fullText": "The Palisades Nuclear Generating Station is nestled between sand dunes on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan. It shut down for financial reasons in 2022. Three years later, it’s on the cusp of reopening, with hundreds of workers streaming through its security barriers every day.\n\nPalisades is on track to restart in early 2026. When it does, it will be the first nuclear plant in the United States to generate electricity again after being decommissioned. Nick Culp of Holtec, the company that owns the plant, said its revival is a response to a surge in demand for electricity.\n\n“We have seen [Michigan]’s baseload generation go offline at a rapid rate as they’ve moved away from fossil generation,” Culp said. “How do you backfill that when you see demand on the horizon like [artificial intelligence], like data storage, like keeping the lights on at home, and new manufacturing?”\n\nNuclear is part of the answer to that question, Culp said, and the government agrees. Michigan gave $300 million to the restart — part of its goal to have 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 — and the federal government gave the project a loan of more than $1.5 billion.\n\nThat money is part of the Trump administration’s investment in what it’s calling a “nuclear energy renaissance.” In May, the White House released a plan to quadruple American nuclear power by 2050, following a similar pledge from the Biden administration.\n\nMeeting that goal would require dozens of new reactors. But whether they’re traditional power plants or new designs, nuclear reactors are expensive and slow to build. Facing a crunch between climate goals and rising electricity demand, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Iowa are reopening plants that closed just a few years ago.\n\nWhen the Palisades plant in Michigan closed in 2022, Jim Byrd said he left his office of more than two decades “with a heavy heart.”\n\nHe was working at a nuclear plant in Mississippi last year when he heard about the plan to reboot Palisades. Then he got the call he had been waiting for, asking him to come back.\n\n“Palisades is my home. These people are my family,” Byrd said. Since his return, he’s been training new employees in an exact replica of the reactor control room, right down to its 1960s pink-and-green color scheme.\n\nWhile the plant was in decent shape, recommissioning still required repairing equipment and overcoming mountains of paperwork.\n\n“We are creating a roadmap on how to do this, and the whole industry is watching,” said Byrd. “I had existing licensed operators that had a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission when we shut down, so we had to work on getting those back.”\n\nAll that work is worth it, he said, to get the plant back up and running.\n\n“What we're doing here is exciting,” said Byrd. “Having a reliable power source that keeps your electricity costs low, everybody should be rooting for that.”\n\nThe restart also attracted employees from elsewhere in the industry. The plant’s new chief nuclear officer, Rich Burroni, came from New York’s Indian Point Energy Center, which closed in 2021.\n\n“The trend five years ago was a lot of work on decommissioning,” he said, “and now that’s all changed.”\n\nMore change may be coming for Palisades. The Department of Energy said this month it will give Holtec up to $400 million in federal funding to build small modular reactors in Michigan. That technology could help speed up the deployment of new nuclear power in the future, according to many in the industry, but so far has not been commercially viable.\n\nFor now, restarting a plant costs less than a third of what it would take to build a new one, said Culp of Holtec.\n\n“When you factor in how long it takes to construct a new nuclear power plant, especially here in the United States, and the amount of money that goes into it,” he said, “it’s a pretty good value proposition.”\n\nMany of Palisades’ employees live within 10 miles of the plant, which means they could be exposed to a radioactive plume in an emergency.\n\nThat zone also includes the town of Covert, Michigan. Township supervisor Daywi Cook’s father helped build the plant in the 1960s.\n\n“I grew up with the sirens being tested. I think it was every last Saturday of the month,” Cook said. “It was just a normal thing.”\n\nHaving friends and family members who worked at the plant helped demystify nuclear power, she said, and she came to see the plant as part of the community.\n\nAt one point, taxes from the plant made up 40% of the township’s revenue. Now, as Covert’s township supervisor, Cook said she’s glad the plant is reopening.\n\n“Having that stability and having that employment available for folks who live here is something that I think was taken for granted for a very long time,” she said. “I think what's important is that we educate ourselves as residents near the plant and that Holtec continues to be a good neighbor in being transparent with the community.”\n\nZach Morris, head of the economic development group Market One, said Pallisades is an important piece of the local economy.\n\n“Southwest Michigan is a beautiful area. It's just a wonderful community of small towns. I call it Americana,” Morris said. “Americana needs electricity. So the good news is we have a really reliable source of power that is clean. It pays its employees well. So we're excited about being able to keep that online.”\n\nNot everyone is on board with the plant’s reopening. Environmental groups have sued to stop it, and protesters have raised concerns about the long-term storage of spent fuel next to the Great Lakes.\n\nWhile nuclear power does have a record of safety, many Americans remember the 1979 disaster at central Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island. One of the two reactors on the island had a partial meltdown and released radioactive gases into the environment. There were no deaths, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the accident “had no detectable health effects on plant workers or the public.”\n\nThat left the plant with only one working reactor, which produced power until 2019, when it shut down for financial reasons. Today, that reactor, like Palisades in western Michigan, is in the process of coming back online.\n\n“When you walk through the plant now, all the equipment is still there, but it's deathly quiet. You don't hear the hum of the motors, the steam going through the lines,” said Craig Smith, who is in charge of bringing back the plant at Three Mile Island, renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center. “It's an eerie kind of feeling when you walk through the plant.”\n\nThat eerie feeling may soon be gone. A red LCD clock in Smith’s office counts down the hours until the plant’s reopening in late 2027, which is backed by a billion-dollar loan from the Trump Administration.\n\nThe recommissioned reactor on Three Mile Island will pump 835 megawatts into the regional grid, but all that electricity is spoken for by Microsoft, which agreed to buy an equivalent amount of power from the grid for the next 20 years to feed its data centers.\n\n“The dynamics of the energy economy have changed significantly, mainly because of artificial intelligence,” Smith said.\n\nNuclear is well-suited to the moment, in his view, because of its consistency.\n\n“Hottest days of the year, coldest days of the year, freezing weather, the plant continues to operate,” Smith said. “As far as a reliable power source, you can’t beat it.”\n\nSmith was in high school in nearby Hershey in 1979 and remembers the evacuation after the disaster at Three Mile Island. That failed to dissuade him from going into a career in nuclear power, and he said today, the industry is safer because of regulations put in place after the partial meltdown.\n\n“People at the plant here take that personally,” he said. “The standards of the industry are greatly improved, and we've made significant improvements to the design of the plants and how we operate them.”\n\nGene Stilp has a different take. He’s one of many people in the area who say the official story of the 1979 disaster failed to account for long-term health problems they believe are related to the accident.\n\nStilp has been fighting nuclear power on Three Mile Island since before the plant opened, and said the recommissioning is an unnecessary risk to public safety.\n\n“We’re sticking up for the people who live here rather than the shareholders of Microsoft and Constellation,” said Stilp, who often appears in public wearing a blazer with “NO TMI RESTART” sewn on the back.\n\n“What they’re proposing for evacuation does not work, and so that’s my line in the sand,” he said, pointing out the 10-mile Emergency Planning Zone includes a major hospital complex and several schools. “The population increases in Central Pennsylvania, the realization that there are so many people at risk here, the best you can do is take away that risk.”\n\nAnother longtime opponent of the power plant, Eric Epstein of Three Mile Island Alert, said the country is making mistakes in its rush to power data centers. He said the economics might have changed for nuclear power, but the risks have not.\n\n“There was no public discussion about whether or not we’re going to restart Three Mile Island,” said Epstein. “You had this psychic tear in the fabric of the community that can't be papered over. You can put all the green paint you want on nuclear power, but there has been no viable solution to isolate nuclear waste.”\n\nConstellation said the spent fuel on site has been safely stored on the island for decades, in fortified containers required by the government to withstand natural disasters, and that all the waste created in 40 years fits in an area about the size of two tennis courts.\n\nDauphin County Commissioner Justin Douglas said he’s listening to local concerns about the plant’s reopening.\n\n“I personally am very interested in transparency and accountability for this in the sense of ensuring that it's as safe as it possibly can be, that we're tracking the cost and ensuring that the taxpayers aren't carrying any of the burden, that we have a good plan for the waste management and that ultimately the community impact is positive,” said Douglas. “We plan for the worst, and we hope for the best.”\n\nMeeting the country’s rising demand for electricity will take a lot more than reviving a few recently decommissioned plants.\n\n“It is a brilliant idea. It's sort of a slam dunk. The downside is that there are not many reactors out there that are realistically able to restart,” said Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “You’re looking at a little bit less than three gigawatts of electricity, out of 50 that apparently are required for data centers and AI.”\n\nThere are also technical tweaks called uprates that can squeeze more power out of existing plants, which could help blunt the immediate electricity crunch.\n\n“You probably have potential for another five to eight gigawatts across the whole fleet. So you add that up to the two or three that we get from the restarts, you're looking at 10 [gigawatts],” Buongiorno said, or only about a fifth of the total AI power demand expected by 2030.\n\n“If that demand continues in the 2030s, then you can make the investment now to build new reactors,” he said, “and then nuclear can actually capture a lot more than 20%.”\n\nThis segment aired on December 9, 2025.",

    "fullText": "The world is getting hotter, and if you think that means more sunbathing and beach days, think again. There are serious consequences to such a major shift in the climate, and ordinary people all around the world are starting to feel the effects. A new report released in early November in Belgium detailed the expected effect on the country's economy and people, and that report revealed that disaster is looming, Belga News Agency reported.\n\nThe Belgian Climate Risk Assessment came from the climate institute Cerac and is meant to advise the leaders of the country in the defense of its national security. Unfortunately, the findings of this study were bleak.\n\n\"The question is no longer if climate disasters will happen, but when and how we will respond,\" the report said, per Belga News Agency. \"This demands a shift in mindset in which climate change is considered a fundamental and society-wide threat for national security.\"\n\nCerac found that the changing climate threatens Belgium's economy, food supply, water, public health, mortality rate, and even tourism.\n\nWhile a few degrees' difference in temperature might not sound that significant, a shift in the average temperature leads to significant increases in extreme weather events, not to mention changes in agricultural conditions. These lead to economic losses through both natural disasters and the impact on farmers.\n\nMeanwhile, heat leads to a greater number of deaths, both directly through heatwaves and indirectly through the spread of mosquitoes that carry diseases. There are also subtler effects on public health, such as more severe allergy cases due to more pollen in the air and a greater strain on mental health in general.\n\nAll of these effects lead to economic strain, which could also lead to financial institutions and reinsurers leaving the market, causing greater costs for everyday Belgian citizens and business owners. The result is an expected uptick of about 15% in public debt in 2050.\n\nAll in all, ordinary people throughout the country will suffer as the world gets hotter.\n\nHaving the consequences of the changing climate spelled out so clearly can help policymakers prepare to meet these challenges head-on. For example, knowing that more expensive natural disasters are only a matter of time means that they can set money aside for disaster aid.\n\nHowever, the best possible outcome from this study would be a reduction in the air pollution that is driving the changes to the climate in the first place, in order to halt the planet's overheating.\n\nShould the government provide incentives to buy EVs?\n\nDepends on if it's federal or states\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Clay is one of the most abundant materials on Earth. Holcim, an international construction and building materials company, is capitalizing on this abundance by using \"calcined clay\" to make strong cement that is better for people and the planet, according to the company's website.\n\nAs the website indicates, the chemical reactions involved in making conventional cement release planet-heating carbon pollution into the atmosphere. However, the company claims there's a way to tweak the ingredients and reduce that harmful pollution by half, without sacrificing the strength of the building material.\n\nHolcim's use of calcined clay — natural clay that has been heated to high temperatures — partly replaces an ingredient called \"clinker\" in cement. Clinker is produced by heating limestone, a process that accounts for a large portion of cement-making's carbon pollution.\n\nThe product with calcined clay is a cement that mixes and hardens like normal and is as durable and resilient once poured, according to Holcim. Yet its cement-making process does not fuel rising global temperatures as much as standard methods.\n\nIn turn, that also means it contributes less to creating conditions for intensified extreme weather events such as wildfires, floods, and droughts that put people's lives at risk.\n\nHolcim's cement production is hitting the ground running. According to the company, it scaled up the first new production line dedicated to calcined clay cement in Europe in 2023. Holcim aims for that plant, located in Saint-Pierre-la-Cour, France, to produce 500,000 tons of calcined clay annually by 2030.\n\nA similar initiative is in development at the company's Czech Republic plant. In total, Holcim is manufacturing the calcined clay product in nine plants across Europe, Latin America, and North Africa. The largest operation is in Guayaquil, Ecuador, which is on track to churn out 2 million tons of the material a year, Holcim reported.\n\nHolcim's cement is now used at project sites around the world. It has already formed the literal building blocks for an Olympic stadium in Marseille, France, an office complex in Milan, Italy, and an apartment building in Cancun, Mexico.\n\nNew building developments can encroach on important natural habitats and disrupt local ecosystems. Yet changes that help clean up the construction industry reduce its overall impact.\n\nHolcim is proving how producing cement with less carbon pollution can also be a smart business move, as its commitment to sustainable building materials is driving profits. The company's sales of calcined clay-based cement spiked in the first half of 2025, according to Rémi Barbarulo, Holcim's Head of Cement Research & Development.",

    "fullText": "The National Weather Service has been busy over the past few weeks as extreme weather surges across the United States. Record warm temperatures along the West coast brought catastrophic flooding to the region while temperatures continue to plunge in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions as record cold and heavy snowfall dominate the area.\n\nEarlier this week the NWS issued a winter storm warning for several states, but played particular attention to Montana, which is expecting a surge in snowfall.\n\n“For the Winter Storm Warning, heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 6 and 12 inches, with localized amounts approaching 20 inches in the Island Ranges. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph,” the NWS said in a statement.\n\nThe heavy snowfall is expected to hit The Highwood, Little Belt, Judith, and Snowy Mountains, and Southern Rocky Mountain Front, though much of the middle part of the state is in danger of serious weather.\n\nAn interactive map from the National Weather Service shows the percentage change of a storm to exceed the initial warning criteria revealed for the area. Much of Montana sits in a very high probability range that weather will become much more serious than initially predicted, according to the model.\n\nAnother map from the NWS shows regions south of Lewistown, MT are expecting up to 24 inches of snow - or perhaps more as the scale tops out at 24 inches - through Sunday, Dec. 14.\n\nIn addition to a Winter Storm Warning, much of Montana received an Extreme Cold Warning as well, with temperatures dropping to more than 20 degrees below zero.",

    "description": "The evidence is growing.",
    "fullText": "Dementia is often associated with older people, but it doesn't just appear out of nowhere.\n\nSome risk factors could start before we're even born, while others emerge as we progress through childhood into young adulthood.\n\nAccording to research, that could be the best time to start intervention.\n\nPrevious studies have identified a variety of modifiable risk factors for dementia, but modifying them after neurodegeneration has set in isn't much help, encouraging researchers to look to life's earliest moments for actions that could one day make a difference.\n\nA study conducted in 2023 by researchers in Sweden and the Czech Republic identified a handful of birth factors associated with a slightly increased risk of dementia later in life.\n\nWhile some, such as sharing the womb with a twin, are beyond anyone's control, others – such as a shorter spacing between births, and falling pregnant over the age of 35 – may weigh into parental decision making.\n\nYou can see a video summary of some of the research in this article here:\n\nAnother study published in late 2024 looked at risk factors for younger adults aged 18 to 39 years. A team led by the Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI) in Ireland gathered a group of experts from 15 countries around the world to help develop a lifelong plan for boosting brain health.\n\n\"Young adulthood represents a pivotal window for intervention that could significantly reduce the risk of dementia later in life,\" said Francesca Farina, neuroscientist at GBHI.\n\n\"To secure healthier brain outcomes, young adults must be included as key partners in research, education, and policymaking efforts.\"\n\nOf the risk factors identified by the researchers, some are related to lifestyle, including excessive drinking, smoking, physical inactivity, and social isolation.\n\nOthers are environmental, such as pollution exposure, traumatic brain injuries, hearing or vision loss, or a low level of education. And others, like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, LDL cholesterol, and depression, are health issues that may arise from lifestyle choices.\n\nUltimately, the researchers suggest many of the risk factors are steps we could take to help lower our risk of developing dementia, which may begin to grow far earlier in our lives than many people realize.\n\n\"Could the roots of dementia stretch as far back as childhood or infancy? Increasing evidence suggests yes, and that risk factor exposures in the first decade of life (or even while in the womb) may have lifelong implications for dementia risk,\" the team explained in an article in The Conversation published earlier this year.\n\n\"Most dementia research understandably focuses on changes associated with [age-related cognitive] decline in later life. But there is increasing evidence that many of the differences in brain structure and function associated with dementia in older adults may have at least partly existed since childhood.\"\n\nAccording to the team, there are numerous examples of this.\n\n\"In long-term studies where people have had their cognitive ability tracked across their whole lives, one of the most important factors explaining someone's cognitive ability at age 70 is their cognitive ability when they were 11,\" the study authors explained.\n\n\"That is, older adults with poorer cognitive skills have often had these lower skills since childhood, rather than the differences being solely due to a faster decline in older age.\"\n\nAnother potential signal is evidence of brain injuries or abnomalities in later life that may relate to incidents or behaviors in youth.\n\n\"Similar patterns are also seen when looking for evidence of dementia-related damage on brain scans, with some changes appearing to be more closely related to risk factor exposures in early life than current unhealthy lifestyles,\" the authors explained.\n\n\"Taken together, perhaps the time has come for dementia prevention to be thought of as a lifelong goal, rather than simply a focus for old age.\"\n\nIn their 2024 study, some of the identified risk factors may seem obvious. Drinking and smoking, for instance, are known to be bad for health in general, and sustaining a brain injury is a direct risk for later dementia.\n\nBut others take a more winding route – losing hearing or vision, for example, is also tied to dementia, possibly because of brain degeneration or social isolation.\n\nKnowing the risks is one thing, but mitigating them is tricky. The researchers suggest that the issue could be best addressed by identifying factors at individual, community, and national levels.\n\nHelping people at the individual level involves raising awareness of the importance of brain health and risks, the team says.\n\nThis could be done with public health campaigns and education at school, and funded through taxation of substances that negatively affect brain health, such as alcohol or cigarettes.\n\nAt the community level, the team recommends developing an advisory council of diverse young adults to \"function as a liaison with local governments to provide contextual knowledge around brain health in the community.\"\n\nAnd at the national level, the panel suggests creating and committing to a brain health charter to keep people on track for better brain health throughout their lives.\n\n\"There is a real appetite for young adults to learn more about their brain health – they are highly aware of cognitive and neurodiversity, with many identifying with diagnoses like ADHD or autism,\" said GBHI social gerontologist Laura Booi.\n\n\"This awareness drives their strong interest in understanding and improving their brain health.\"\n\nThe identified factors aren't static, either. The team says that emerging factors require more study, including ultra-processed foods, drug use, screen time, stress, and microplastics exposure.\n\nThe research was published in The Lancet: Healthy Longevity.\n\nA Daily Habit of 8 Energy Drinks May Have Triggered a UK Man's Stroke\n\nMisophonia Has Genetic Links to Anxiety And Depression, Study Reveals\n\nDick Van Dyke Credits His Longevity to One Habit, And It's Backed by Science",

    "fullText": "The automotive world has given us incredible engineering feats, iconic designs, and moments that changed transportation forever. But alongside these achievements are puzzles that have captivated enthusiasts for decades.\n\nFrom legendary prototypes that vanished without a trace to engineering decisions that still spark heated debates, these mysteries remind us that car history isn't always written in stone.\n\nSome questions may never have definitive answers, and honestly, that's part of what makes them so fascinating to discuss over a wrench and a cold drink in the garage. The following mysteries have different endings: while some have a pretty possible answer, others still have us scratching our heads.\n\nSteve McQueen's 1968 Highland Green Mustang GT from Bullitt became one of the most famous movie cars ever, but for decades, nobody knew where it was. Two identical Mustangs were used for filming, and while one was long believed to have met its end as a battered camera car, the hero car seemingly disappeared into thin air.\n\nThe automotive community spent years hunting for it, with rumors placing it everywhere from Mexico to a Kentucky junkyard. Then in 2018, it reappeared at the Detroit Auto Show, having been quietly owned by the same family since 1974.\n\nThe owner had kept it largely original, complete with movie modifications and that iconic roar, proving that sometimes the best hiding place is simply staying quiet.\n\nPreston Tucker’s 1948 Tucker ’48 Sedan was genuinely ahead of its time, featuring a rear-mounted engine, four-wheel independent suspension, and innovative safety features that Detroit wouldn’t adopt for decades. Tucker had originally promoted disc brakes and fuel injection, but those ideas were dropped before production.\n\nBut his ambitious venture collapsed amid controversy, SEC investigations, and allegations that were later dismissed in court. While Tucker was acquitted of all fraud charges, his company was already finished, leaving only 51 cars ever produced.\n\nWhether it was a case of an innovator crushed by established industry forces or a business that simply overreached remains one of automotive history's great debates.\n\nEveryone knows the 1966 Batmobile was built from a Lincoln Futura concept car by legendary customizer George Barris, but the question of what engine actually propelled it has caused decades of confusion. The Lincoln Futura originally had a 368-cubic-inch Lincoln V8, but various sources have claimed everything from keeping the original engine to swapping in a 390 or even a 429.\n\nBarris himself gave different answers over the years, and the car underwent modifications throughout its life. Three additional Batmobiles were built for promotional tours, each potentially configured differently, further muddying the waters.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent cutting-edge crime-fighting technology, its actual mechanical specifications remain surprisingly mysterious.\n\nGeneral Motors' EV1, launched in 1996, was the first mass-produced electric vehicle of the modern era and developed a passionate following among its lessees. When GM abruptly canceled the program in 2003, they made the controversial decision to reclaim and crush nearly every single vehicle, despite protests from drivers who wanted to purchase them.\n\nThe company cited parts, liability, and lack of profitability as reasons, but the dramatic destruction of a functioning, beloved product seemed extreme to many. Only about 40 EV1s survived, most of them deactivated and donated to museums and universities with their powertrains disabled so they couldn’t be legally driven on public roads, although a tiny handful have been kept or made operational again under very controlled circumstances.\n\nThe whole saga spawned documentaries and conspiracy theories, making the EV1's fate one of the strangest chapters in automotive history.\n\nThere's a popular story that Enzo Ferrari viewed road car production as merely a necessary evil to finance his true passion of racing. The famous quote attributed to him suggests he built and sold road cars only because he couldn't fund his racing operation any other way.\n\nWhile this makes for a compelling narrative that certainly captures Ferrari's racing-first mentality, historians debate whether it oversimplifies a more complex business reality. Ferrari clearly prioritized racing above all else, but the company's business model required both sides to function.\n\nWhether Enzo truly saw customers as merely checkbooks for his racing dreams or understood the symbiotic relationship between the two remains open to interpretation, though his legendary indifference to customer complaints certainly supports the popular version.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Chrysler built 55 stunning turbine-powered cars and loaned them to regular families across America for real-world testing. These weren't just concepts, they were fully functional vehicles with bronze metallic paint, rotating turbine-inspired taillights, and jet engines that could run on almost anything from diesel to perfume.\n\nThe program ran from 1963 to 1966, and the cars performed surprisingly well, but Chrysler ultimately decided not to pursue production. Here's where it gets weird: of the 55 cars built, Chrysler destroyed 46 of them, mainly to avoid long-term liability and support problems with such a unique fleet in private hands (the often-repeated ‘import duties on the Italian bodies’ explanation is only part of the story), leaving just nine survivors.\n\nThose nine survivors are scattered among museums, with a few in private collections, representing one of the boldest experiments that almost changed automotive history but didn't.\n\nMazda's unwavering commitment to the rotary engine, even when it nearly bankrupted the company multiple times, remains one of automotive history's most puzzling strategic decisions. The Wankel rotary engine offered a smoother, more compact alternative to piston engines, and Mazda licensed the technology in the 1960s with genuine enthusiasm.\n\nDespite chronic issues with fuel economy, oil consumption, and emissions regulations, Mazda kept developing rotaries for decades, culminating in the legendary RX-7 and RX-8. The company invested massive resources into an engine design that most manufacturers had already abandoned as impractical.\n\nWhile enthusiasts celebrate Mazda's dedication to uniqueness and the rotary's undeniable character, it's still unclear whether this was visionary persistence or stubborn defiance of market reality.\n\nJohn DeLorean's stainless steel sports car dream became reality with substantial backing from the British government, which invested over $120 million in a factory in Northern Ireland. The deal seemed too good to be true for an unproven car company, and it was: the project collapsed amid allegations of drug trafficking in a controversial FBI sting operation.\n\nDeLorean was eventually acquitted on grounds of entrapment, but by then, the company was finished after producing only about 9,000 cars. Questions remain about the financial arrangements, government motivations, and whether the whole venture was viable from the start.\n\nThe DeLorean story has everything: innovation, government intrigue, legal drama, and ultimately, immortality through Back to the Future.\n\nMost people credit Pontiac's 1964 GTO as the first muscle car, creating the formula of stuffing a big engine into a midsize body. But Studebaker enthusiasts will quickly point out that the 1963 Avanti R3 and the 1963-64 Lark Daytona with the R2 supercharged engine came first, offering serious performance in relatively affordable packages.\n\nStudebaker was installing high-performance V8s in compact bodies before Pontiac made it famous. The debate comes down to definitions: was it about the specific formula, the marketing approach, or the cultural impact? Studebaker certainly had the hardware first, but Pontiac created the phenomenon.\n\nWhether this makes Studebaker the forgotten originator or simply an earlier experiment depends on how you define the category itself.\n\nIt's estimated that hundreds of thousands of cars were built between 1900 and 1915, yet remarkably few survive today compared to later eras. These early automobiles, often called \"brass-era\" cars for their prominent brass fixtures, have survival rates that seem impossibly low given the sheer numbers produced.\n\nMany were simply worn out and scrapped, but that doesn't fully explain where they all went. The materials were valuable during wartime scrap drives, they were considered worthless old junk long before anyone thought to preserve them, and many likely decayed in barns and fields before anyone recognized their historical value.\n\nThe few survivors command enormous prices today, making you wonder how many treasures are still hiding in forgotten corners waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe 427 Shelby Cobra has legendary performance figures that seem to vary depending on who's telling the story and which magazine you're reading. While we know the top speed, published 0-60 times range from 3.5 to 4.5 seconds, and quarter-mile times are similarly inconsistent.\n\nThe problem is that these weren't factory cars with standardized specifications; they were essentially hand-built race cars with street registration, each potentially different. Testing conditions varied wildly, some cars had race modifications, and Carroll Shelby himself was known for optimistic claims. Modern recreations and continuation cars add to the confusion by posting different numbers with modern tires and tuning.\n\nFor a car that's supposed to represent pure, raw American performance, we still can't quite pin down exactly how raw it really was.\n\nThe Pontiac Fiero suffered from one of the strangest reputation spirals in automotive history, earning a “fire hazard” label that stuck far harder than the underlying facts.\n\nEarly 1984 Fieros did experience a higher-than-normal rate of engine fires, largely due to a connecting-rod failure in the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. But contrary to the common retelling, GM didn’t solve the problem overnight—the company didn’t issue a full recall until late 1987, after several years of incidents and negative publicity. By that time, the damage to the Fiero’s image was irreversible. Ironically, once the mechanical issues were addressed, later Fieros had fire incident rates much closer to other cars of the era.\n\nAnd when Pontiac finally perfected the formula with the vastly improved 1988 suspension and upgraded powertrains, the car was already living under a cloud it couldn’t escape. The Fiero remains a case study in how early flaws—and delayed corporate responses—can overshadow genuine engineering progress.\n\nThese automotive mysteries remind us that history isn't always as clear-cut as we'd like it to be. Some puzzles stem from lost documentation, others from deliberate secrecy, and still others from the simple fact that people remember things differently over time.\n\nWhat makes these stories fascinating isn't necessarily finding definitive answers, but the conversations they spark and the detective work they inspire. The next time you're at a car show or scrolling through auction listings, remember that automotive history is still being written and rewritten.\n\nWho knows what forgotten prototype might be gathering dust in someone's garage, or what long-held belief might be overturned by newly discovered documents tomorrow.",

Our country’s going to be strong, safe, rich, it’s going to be great. We’re going to make America great again!”\n\nHe also made waves in October with a video posted to Truth Social that showed him ruling for thousands of years, all the way up to the year 90,000 and beyond, ending with a sign that simply read, ‘TRUMP 4EVA.’\n\nThe president’s official merch store even began selling ‘Trump 2028’ hats in April, encouraging supporters to “make a statement” by wearing them.\n\nOthers in Trump’s orbit have also hinted at a potential circumvention of the 22nd Amendment, including Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who said in November that he was in talks with “one of the top constitutional lawyers” in the U.S. about the potential paths to a third Trump term.\n\n“As he works through this, his quote to me is ‘Bannon, you can drive a Mack truck through the 22nd Amendment,’” Bannon recounted on his War Room podcast, adding, “So, suck on that.”\n\nBannon also told The Economist in an October interview that there were “many different alternatives” to overcoming the 22nd Amendment.\n\n“At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is, but there’s a plan and President Trump will be the president in ’28,” Bannon said.\n\nOthers, like former DOGE head Elon Musk, have also expressed support for continued MAGA control of the White House, albeit with Vice President JD Vance taking over in 2028 instead. Polling currently has Vance leading the pack of preferred potential nominees for 2028, although his lead is shrinking.\n\nPolling released earlier this month found that among voters who backed Trump in 2024, 45 percent oppose the president running for a third term in 2028, and 43 percent support the idea.\n\nBut among all Americans, just 21 percent are in favor of a third Trump term.",

    "description": "Radiocarbon dating of ancient scripts suggests a groundbreaking origin story.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nFor decades, archeologists have debated whether the writing system of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), known as Rongorongo, was invented independently or influenced by Europeans.\n\nA new study that uses radiocarbon dating to assess the age of four Rongorongo tablets shows that one of the tablets predates the arrival of Europeans in the 1720s.\n\nHowever, the date only reflects when the wood was felled, and sample size of one isn’t large enough to be entirely certain.\n\nToday, humans inhabit—or have, at the very least, explored—pretty much every corner of the planet. But that immense proliferation of Home sapiens across the globe was a slow process. With the first humans leaving Africa between 60 to 90 thousand years ago, the species slowly spread across the Earth over many millennia. And one of the last places these ancient humans made their way to was the southeastern Pacific island of Rapa Nui, known more broadly as Easter Island.\n\nLocated 2,360 miles off the coast of Chile—which annexed the country back in 1888—Rapa Nui is one of the most isolated places in the world. Its native people, who are also named the Rapa Nui, first arrived on the island’s shores between 1150 and 1280 CE, and lived in isolation until the arrival of Dutch navigator Jacob Roggeveen in 1722.\n\nWhile Europeans eventually discovered the impressive moai statues for which the Rapa Nui are best known, they also stumbled upon a yet-undeciphered script known as Rongorongo—a three-dimensional writing system that uses pictorial signs known as glyphs.\n\nBut because this script wasn’t first described until 1864, archaeologist and historians have since pondered an enduring question: Did the Rapa Nui independently invent this language, or were they influenced by Europeans?\n\nNow, a study is attempting to solve this linguistic conundrum by suggesting that, using radiocarbon dating, one of the 27 wooden objects containing Rongorongo inscriptions pre-dates the arrival of Europeans, at around 1493 to 1509. This finding suggests that the Rapa Nui could’ve possibly invented Rongorongo independently—a rare feat throughout human history, and one usually associated with complex states.\n\nThe other strong piece of evidence for this homegrown language theory is that Rongorongo functions much differently than European languages, which would appear to suggest no discernible outside influence. Lead author Silvia Ferarra, an archeologist and linguist at the University of Bologna, Italy, published her team’s findings in Scientific Reports in early February.\n\n“The question is of crucial importance, as it implies the possibility of an independent invention of writing, similarly to what happened in other parts of the world where writing was an original creation, e.g., in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and Mesoamerica,” the paper reads. “If Rongorongo predates the arrival of external travelers, it could represent another, and the latest, invention of writing in human history.”\n\nWhile one of the four wood tablets examined provides pre-European evidence for the language, the discovery also comes with a few caveats. For one, radiocarbon dating can only detect when a tree was cut down, not inscribed—though, Ferrara suggests that centuries old wood would be unsuitable for such a task. But, more importantly, the wood tablet provides only a sample size of one, as the other examined tablets all fell on the other side of the European divide.\n\nTo gather further evidence, Ferrara would have to examine the other remaining tablets, which are all that is left of the long-forgotten language. But they’ve been scattered across the globe, and are not easy to access. For now, the search continues in the effort to place the contributions of these native people in the correct historical context.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran has arrested Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, her supporters said Friday.\n\nA foundation in her name said she was detained in Mashhad, some 680 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of the capital, Tehran, while attending a memorial for a human rights lawyer recently found dead under unclear circumstances.\n\nA local official reportedly acknowledged arrests had been made, but did not directly name Mohammadi, 53. It wasn't clear if authorities would immediately return her to prison, where she had been serving a sentence until her temporary release in December 2024 for medical purposes.\n\nHowever, her detention comes as Iran has been cracking down on intellectuals and others as Tehran struggles with sanctions, an ailing economy and the fear of a renewed war with Israel. Arresting Mohammadi may spark increased pressure from the West at a time when Iran repeatedly signals it wants new negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program — something that has yet to happen.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee said it was “deeply concerned” by Mohammadi's arrest.\n\nThe committee “calls on the Iranian authorities to immediately clarify Mohammadi’s whereabouts, ensure her safety and integrity, and to release her without conditions,” it said in a statement.\n\nActivist detained at ceremony for dead lawyer\n\nHer supporters on Friday described her as having been “violently detained earlier today by security and police forces.” They said other activists had been arrested as well at a ceremony honoring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate who had been based in Mashhad.\n\n“The Narges Foundation calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all detained individuals who were attending a memorial ceremony to pay their respects and demonstrate solidarity,” a statement read. “Their arrest constitutes a serious violation of fundamental freedoms.”\n\nAlikordi was found dead earlier this month in his office, with provincial officials in describing his death as a heart attack. However, a tightening security crackdown coincided with his death, raising questions. Over 80 lawyers signed a statement demanding more information.\n\n\"What we witnessed today is the Islamic Republic’s latest assault on the most basic human freedoms — where even mourning a slain lawyer becomes a punishable act,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.\n\n“When peaceful citizens cannot mourn without being beaten and dragged away, it reveals a government terrified of truth and accountability. It also reveals the extraordinary bravery of Iranians who refuse to surrender their dignity.\"\n\nFootage purportedly of the ceremony showed Mohammadi with a microphone, calling out to the crowd gathered without wearing a hijab, or headscarf. She started the crowd chanting the name Majidreza Rahnavard, a man whom authorities hanged from a crane in a public execution in 2022.\n\nFootage published by her foundation also showed her without a hijab, surrounded by a large crowd.\n\nHasan Hosseini, the city governor of Mashhad, said prosecutors ordered security officials to temporarily detain a number of participants at the ceremony after the chanting of “norm-breaking” slogans, Iranian state television reported.\n\nHosseini described the detentions as preventive to protect those there from others in the crowd, but did not address claims that security forces used violence in making the arrests.\n\nOther anti-government chants could be heard in purported video footage of the event.\n\nMohammadi had been on furlough for months\n\nSupporters had warned for months that Mohammadi was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns.\n\nWhile that was to be only three weeks, Mohammadi’s time out of prison lengthened, possibly as activists and Western powers pushed Iran to keep her free. She remained out even during the 12-day war in June between Iran and Israel.\n\nMohammadi still kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including even demonstrating at one point in front of Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where she had been held.\n\nMohammadi had been serving 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran’s government. She also had backed the nationwide protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab.\n\nMohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. Her lawyer in late 2024 revealed doctors had found a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous that later was removed.\n\n“Mohammadi’s doctors recently prescribed an extension of her medical leave for at least six more months to conduct thorough and regular medical examinations, including monitoring the bone lesion which was removed from her leg in November, physiotherapy sessions to recover from the surgery and specialized cardiac care,” the Free Narges Coalition said in late February 2025.\n\n“The medical team overseeing Mohammadi’s health has warned that her return to prison — especially under stressful conditions of detention and without adequate medical facilities — could severely worsen her physical well-being.”\n\nAn engineer by training, Mohammadi has been imprisoned 13 times and convicted five. In total, she has been sentenced to over 30 years in prison. Her last incarceration began when she was detained in 2021 after attending a memorial for a person killed in nationwide protests.",

    "fullText": "SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A Georgia woman has been hospitalized with severe burns after someone poured a corrosive chemical onto her head while she was walking at a public park in Savannah, the victim's son and a close friend said Friday.\n\nSavannah police confirmed they are searching for a suspect in the chemical attack at Forsyth Park, one of the historic city's landmark green spaces that attracts runners, picnickers, playing children and sightseeing tourists. Police said the woman appears to have been attacked by a stranger.\n\nThe victim, 46-year-old Ashley Wasielewski, was being treated for second- and third-degree burns at a burn center in Augusta, her son, Westley Wasielewski, told The Associated Press. He said the injuries cover roughly half her body, including her scalp, face, hands and legs.\n\n“We don’t know who did it,\" he said. \"She doesn’t have any enemies. She is a friend to everyone.”\n\nWestley Wasielewski said his mother was walking laps at the park on Wednesday night after attending a Christmas program at a nearby church. He found out about the attack in a call from a bystander who came to his mother's aid. He said he could hear her agonized screams over the phone.\n\nFrom her hospital bed, Ashley Wasielewski told family and friends she was walking the sidewalk along the park's perimeter when she noticed a shadow from someone approaching her from behind. She was turning to face the person when he poured some liquid over her head, said Connor Milam, a close friend.\n\n“She was instantly like, `Why are you pouring water on me?' And then her skin started to burn,” said Milam, who has been at the burn unit with her friend. “She looked down and her pants were starting to burn off her body. She started screaming.”\n\nSavannah police spokesman Neil Penttila said Friday that detectives are working with the FBI to identify the chemical used in the attack. Wasielewski's son said investigators told the family it was so corrosive that it melted the key fob to his mother's car that was in her pocket.\n\nSavannah Police Chief Lenny Gunther said officers have been conducting extra patrols at parks throughout Savannah since the attack. No arrests had been announced by Friday afternoon.\n\nPolice said they were seeking a person of interest and released a security camera image of a man wearing what appeared to be a dark hoodie with a large cartoon rabbit on the front. Police said in a social media post that the man was “not currently a suspect in any crime.”\n\n“Our Police Department is treating this case with the highest urgency,” Savannah Mayor Van Johnson said in a Facebook post. He added: “While this attack is deeply troubling, there is currently no information indicating a broader or ongoing threat to the public.”\n\nPolice did not name Wasielewski as the victim. Her son and Milam both said she wanted to share her story in hopes that people would come forward with information that helps police make an arrest.\n\nMilam described her friend as a giving person who volunteered at a local nature center and packed grocery bags with snacks, toiletries and other essentials to give to homeless people. She said those close to Wasielewski are shocked and baffled by the attack.\n\n“They didn’t rob her. They didn’t take anything from her,\" Milam said. “This was a random person in the park who went out of their way to disfigure another human being.\"",

    "description": "\"If the two sides could talk,\" said UConn Health chair John Driscoll, \"there probably is a way that they could agree on how to to bridge the difference.\"",
    "fullText": "Top healthcare executive John Driscoll calls the looming expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies “a tragedy in the making,” warning that millions of Americans are about to be hit with higher premiums, lost coverage, and rising medical debt as Washington gridlock hardens.\n\nDriscoll, who is currently the chairman of UConn Health after a 25-year career in health care including a previous position as Walgreens Boots Alliance president, said the policy reversal amounts to “a self‑inflicted wound” that will push costs up for both low‑income families and the affluent professionals who thought they were insulated.​\n\nDriscoll cited CBO estimates that if Congress allows the subsidies to lapse, premiums will jump for roughly 24 million marketplace enrollees, and around 2 million people will lose coverage entirely in the near term.\n\n“You don’t solve higher health care costs with fewer people getting insured,” he told Fortune, arguing that the system will simply reprice risk and shift costs onto everyone else. “Whenever you reduce coverage at the bottom, everybody pays \n\nEnhanced premium tax credits, introduced during the pandemic and extended through 2025, have helped double marketplace enrollment and kept average subsidized premiums under about $900 a year. When they expire, KFF News projects a roughly 114% increase in average premium payments for subsidized enrollees in 2026. Older adults and rural residents would be especially exposed, with KFF also warning that adults ages 50 to 64 could see average premium hikes of 75% or more.​\n\nDriscoll argued that the real story is a giant cost shift from government to households and employers, driven by simultaneous Medicaid cuts, work requirements, and subsidy rollbacks. When people lose coverage, he notes, they “don’t stop getting covered by the health care system.” Instead, they show up later and sicker, so hospitals and insurers respond by raising prices to anticipate uncompensated care.\n\nWhen you consider that this is being done to “effectively subsidize a tax deduction for millionaires and billionaires, that’s going to shift health care costs to all of us when people lose coverage,” he added, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that extended President Donald Trump’s previous tax cuts and introduced new ones.\n\nFor Driscoll, the subsidy cliff exposes a deeper “tribal dysfunction” in health policy that has frozen the Affordable Care Act in place instead of improving it. He called Obamacare “a very good but imperfect solution” that cut the uninsured rate roughly in half and slowed healthcare inflation, but he said both parties have refused to engage in the hard work of updating it. “We really aren’t prioritizing the patient,” he said, “we’re prioritizing the politics,” leaving millions facing the choice of dropping coverage or postponing care for serious conditions.\n\n​​He had a warning for Republicans, calling this looming mass expiration of health insurance subsidies a “self-inflicted wound” for the party. “They were elected on solving affordability,” he pointed out, and now they’re going to accelerate the problem. But Driscoll said no side is blameless. “The tragic thing is, neither side really wants to have a sensible conversation about how do you really care for more people and get them better care earlier.”\n\nIt’s true that Democrats drove the ACA, but Driscoll said that by and large they are committed to defending something that was itself a compromise, and the other side is playing offense. “The danger is that some Democrats don’t want to have a conversation on evolving [the ACA] because they feel like they have to defend it and the Republicans don’t ever don’t want to have a conversation about evolving it because they want to destroy it.” The result is you end up here, in “this sort of ridiculous no progress zone.” (Driscoll did disclose that he is serving as Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont’s special advisor on health care.)\n\nFrom his vantage point now, Driscoll argued that the reason America is bedevilled with constant healthcare issues is a mismatch of incentives. “Healthcare is a team sport that keeps getting undermined by individual incentives,” he said, noting that U.S. costs are twice as expensive as the average industrialized country and not nearly as productive, he pointed out.\n\nIn similar countries, roughly 50%-60% of doctors are primary care, but it’s only one in four in the U.S. The problem is that every doctor wants to be a specialist or a surgeon because they’ll roughly double the salary of a pediatrician or internist that way. “Until you change those incentives people are going to keep going towards those higher compensated areas.”\n\nThere’s no one fix to this, but there are steps we could take, Driscoll said. He pointed to expanded drug‑price negotiation, immigration reforms to ease shortages of primary‑care doctors and nurses, “site‑neutral” payment so patients aren’t charged more for identical hospital‑based care, and broader use of value‑based and bundled payment models. But we don’t even seem to be capable of engagement, he argued.\n\n“If the two sides could talk,” Driscoll said, “there probably is a way that they could agree on how to to bridge the difference between what Biden and Trump want to do on drug costs. If we could talk, we could probably agree on how to bring back value-based care that would balance the interests of doctors and hospitals and and patients’ outcomes and the government’s obligation.” If only.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "San Antonio police are warning residents to be alert when withdrawing large sums of money after more than 200 reported cases this year of \"jugging.\"\n\nIt's a crime in which suspects follow someone from a bank or ATM who has just withdrawn money and steal their cash at the first opportunity, often in a violent smash and grab.\n\nPolice shared footage of a jugging incident caught on camera involving a man who withdrew a large amount of money from an ATM and left it on the passenger seat of his vehicle before stopping to pump gas.\n\nInvestigators say suspects in a stolen car tailed the victim from the ATM to the gas station, circled his vehicle twice and then broke in, taking the cash.\n\nDetective Nathan Zachary said the pattern is simple: someone leaves a bank with money in hand, a soon-to-be thief sees this, follows them and quickly snatches the cash - either from the vehicle or directly from the victim.\n\nHe said jugging cases have been reported across the city, including one case in which someone was followed starting at the Ingram Road and Loop 410 area, all the way out to Boerne.\n\nIt's a rising crime that San Antonio police have been focusing in on this year.\n\nZachary advises people to \"check your tail\" when leaving a bank or ATM.\n\n\"If they stop when you stop and when you go somewhere else you see that car, they're probably waiting to steal money from you,\" he said.\n\nHe also recommends concealing bank envelopes or withdrawing cash discreetly so suspects don't see how much you're carrying.\n\nPolice stressed that jugging isn't tied to a specific neighborhood and urged anyone handling large sums of cash to remain aware of their surroundings and avoid leaving money visible inside a vehicle.\n\nThis article originally published at WATCH: San Antonio police share footage of jugging caught at gas station.",

    "fullText": "NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) — Haneen al-Mabhouh, 34, sits in a wheelchair in her family home in Nuseirat, central Gaza, mourning the loss of her four daughters, including her 5-month-old baby, who were killed in an Israeli strike on her home last year. Al-Mabhouh also lost her leg in the attack and awaits permission to travel abroad for further treatment that could restore her mobility.\n\n“I dream of walking again, of holding a new baby, of rebuilding my family,” she said, her voice heavy with grief. For now, she relies on her parents for basic daily care and cannot even hold a pen.\n\nNearby, 23-year-old Yassin Marouf lies in a tent, his left foot amputated and his right leg severely injured after being hit by Israeli shelling in May. His brother was killed in the same attack, and Marouf struggles with basic movements. Doctors say his right leg may also need amputation unless he receives treatment outside the Palestinian territory.\n\n“If I want to go to the bathroom, I need two or three people to carry me,” he said.\n\nIn Gaza, thousands face similar challenges. Youssef al-Samri, 16, lost both legs while fetching water near his home after an Israeli airstrike in May. Displaced to a kindergarten in the al-Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, he navigates his world on his hands, relying on support to move through the classrooms where children play around him.\n\nTwelve-year-old Fadi al-Balbisi is learning to walk again with a prosthetic after losing his right leg to shelling in April. At Hamad Hospital in Zawaida, he practices with a prosthetic limb under the guidance of specialists, each step a hard-earned milestone toward regaining independence.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 5,000 to 6,000 people in Gaza have become amputees from the Israel-Hamas war, a quarter of them children. Many face long waits for prosthetics or medical evacuations abroad. Local centers, like the Artificial Limbs and Polio Center in Gaza City, are overwhelmed and have only limited supplies to provide artificial limbs.\n\nWhile a recent shipment of essential prosthetic materials has arrived in Gaza, the need remains critical. Patients like al-Mabhouh and Marouf face months-long waits for treatments that could prevent further amputations or restore mobility. Even with ceasefires in place, medical evacuations have been slow, hampered by bureaucratic and logistical barriers.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, the lives of those affected are frozen in uncertainty. For al-Mabhouh, Marouf, al-Samri, and al-Balbisi, each day is a struggle for movement, dignity, and hope, as they navigate the aftermath of war with resilience and the faint promise of medical help.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "fullText": "An Oregon company bent on selling illegal \"defeat devices\" paid a hefty price.\n\nIn August, Diamond Eye Manufacturing settled a lawsuit with the Environmental Protection Agency, agreeing to fork over $265,000 and post an announcement of the settlement on its website for eight weeks.\n\nThe company had to destroy its inventory of illegal parts. It also had to notify customers of the settlement and that it cannot provide technical support or honor warranty claims for the illegal parts, according to the EPA.\n\nThe regulator said the Athena-based business sold 33,134 illegal parts from 2017 to 2019 \"that allowed for the removal of a vehicle's emission control components.\"\n\nThe Oregon Capital Chronicle reported that the EPA came after fabricators after first targeting distributors of the products.\n\n\"All we do is bend tubes into crazy shapes for trucks. We manufacture the pipes,\" James Smith, marketing and information technology manager for Diamond Eye, told the outlet. \"Whether or not you reincorporate or weld the pollution equipment back together is up to the installer and individual folks.\"\n\nThe argument seems disingenuous at best. As the Capital Chronicle reported, Diamond Eye sold pipes marketed by distributors as \"cat delete.\" A catalytic converter is a device that captures harmful gases from exhaust and makes them less harmful before they're discharged into the environment.\n\nIn December, engine manufacturer Cummins agreed to pay $1.675 billion to settle a Department of Justice lawsuit in which it was accused of installing these defeat or delete devices on nearly one million Ram trucks in violation of the Clean Air Act.\n\nIn September, the DOJ cracked down on the illegal devices, charging eBay with facilitating the sale of hundreds of thousands of products that allow drivers to partake in the dangerous practice of \"rolling coal.\"\n\nThe EPA also reached settlements with six other companies that sold defeat devices, though only one faced a fine in the range of Diamond Eye's: Auburn, Washington-based Competition Specialties, which paid $225,368.\n\nIt noted nitrogen oxides, non-methane hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter increased by 310, 1,140, 120, and 40 times respectively in vehicles without emissions controls. Over the last four years, it shut 172 civil cases, raking in $55.5 million in penalties and 17 criminal cases.\n\n\"Defeat devices enable more air pollution from vehicles to the detriment of Americans' health, and EPA is vigilant about holding accountable the entities that sell these illegal products,\" EPA Pacific Southwest regional administrator Martha Guzman said. \"These settlements demonstrate EPA's commitment to enforcing critical environmental laws that protect clean air and public health.\"\n\nJoin our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "Cardinals predicted to replace Kyler Murray, make bold trade in 2026 NFL Draft originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNot much has gone right for the Arizona Cardinals in 2025.\n\nThere was some optimism around the team this offseason, but the season has been a complete failure. Entering Week 15, the team is sitting at 3-10 and is buried at the bottom of the NFC West.\n\nQuarterback Kyler Murray has only played in five games this season, and it was recently revealed that he will not return in 2025. Is it possible we've seen the last of Murray in a Cardinals' uniform?\n\nPatrick K. Flowers of Bleacher Nation thinks so. Flowers published an updated mock draft, and he has the Cardinals making a bold move to replace Murray in the first round of the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nFlowers has the Cardinals trading up with the New York Giants for the No. 1 pick and selecting Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza.\n\nRegarding the Mendoza selection, Flowers offered the following:\n\nThe Cardinals are going to move on from Kyler Murray. If they don’t trade up with the Giants (who seem intrigued enough in Jaxson Dart to pass on a QB), they’ll almost absolutely be shut out on the big three in the class.\n\nAs Flowers mentioned, it seems likely the Cardinals will move on from Murray. ESPN's Josh Weinfuss recently broke down that possibility, and explained that the Cardinals could save up to $42.5 million if they trade Murray after June 1.\n\nIt's not like the Cardinals were having much success with Murray, anyways. The quarterback went 2-3 as the starter this year and has not been to the playoffs since 2021.\n\nIn Mendoza, the Cardinals would be getting arguably the top quarterback prospect in the 2026 class. Mendoza is the heavy favorite to win the Heisman Trophy and he led the Hoosiers to a perfect record, Big 10 Championship, and a spot in the College Football Playoff.\n\nIn 2025, his first season in Indiana, Mendoza has thrown for 2,980 yards with 33 touchdowns and six interceptions. Mendoza led the FBS in touchdown passes and led the Big 10 in yards per attempt.\n\nMendoza has an NFL arm and solid enough mobility to make some plays with his legs. He moves through his progressions nicely and is able to make throws in tight windows.\n\nIf the Cardinals move on from Murray, Mendoza could start immediately. Jacoby Brissett, who has looked serviceable in relief of Murray this season, is under contract for 2026, so he could be a perfect mentor to Mendoza.",

    "description": "The man behind the \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase will fight for the final time on Saturday night. But who is he, really?",
    "fullText": "The Last Time Is Now. It's the name given to the tournament in which 16 wrestling giants have been competing to be the one opponent in John Cena's final fight before retirement.\n\nAnd that final fight is now - Saturday night - in Washington DC, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career that has seen the American become one of wrestling's biggest and most bankable stars.\n\nIn the 8,570 days since his debut, Cena has clinched 17 world titles and coined the iconic \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase - but the 48-year-old's impact goes far beyond that.\n\nIf you were to pose the question \"who is John Cena?\", depending on who you ask, the answers might vary from legendary WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) superstar, to successful film actor, while some will say he's Mr Make-A-Wish (more on that later).\n\nHow to watch John Cena's last match:\n\nStart time: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event is scheduled to begin at 01:00 GMT on Sun 14 Dec\n\nWhere to watch: In the UK, you can watch for free on WWE's official YouTube channel. Internationally it can be watched on Netflix, and on Peacock in the US\n\nSince his 2002 debut, there's been an evolution in his own wrestling character - transitioning from \"ruthless aggression\" rookie, to a \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" rapper, and eventually a heroic character known for a \"Never Give Up\" attitude.\n\nDespite criticism from some fans of his in-ring ability, with occasional chants of \"you can't wrestle\" through the years, \"there's no doubt that he's an exceptional wrestling talent\", says Brandon Thurston, editor and owner of wrestling website, Wrestlenomics.\n\nHe feels something changed in 2005, after which WWE became \"increasingly scripted in a way it had not been\" before, as it entered into a more controlled, family friendly PG era. But Cena managed thrive.\n\n\"He's definitely been the biggest draw over the time which I would say stretches from 2005 to roughly 2015,\" Mr Thurston says, with Cena's merchandise also regularly topping sales for the company.\n\n\"There's little question that he was WWE's most important economic wrestler throughout that time - in terms of pay-per-view buys, which were still central in that era, TV ratings, and as a house show draw.\"\n\nOutside the ring too, he's a personality who \"people gravitate towards and want to listen to\", says Mr Thurston - and wrestling fans like Joe Clarkson and Sabrina Nicole feel just that.\n\n\"To go for such a long time in an industry, which is quite heavily taxing on the body, is absolutely fascinating,\" says Joe, 24, who was five when he first saw Cena on TV.\n\n\"I think over time, the people just gained more and more respect for him, not just as a performer, but also as an individual.\"\n\nFor Sabrina, 37, who remembers Cena's WWE debut in 2002, it's \"his charisma\".\n\n\"He has just always had something about him that makes him a star,\" she says, adding that for most of his career, he's \"always maintained a good guy persona\".\n\n\"No matter what the crowd, no matter what the fans have thought of him. He has just been the testament to if you have a really good character, you can be on top,\" she says.\n\nIt also seems to be true that, beyond his ability and persona, Cena seized an opportunity.\n\nWith The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin no longer full-time performers, WWE bosses were looking for a new star to emerge.\n\nBrandon feels WWE leadership recognised Cena \"would be a very reliable and extremely hardworking person whom they could entrust with such a spot\".\n\nIt's widely accepted within wrestling circles that the final decision to have Cena as the chosen star would ultimately have been taken by then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon.\n\nWhile he was known for following his instincts, there will also have been a judgement on Cena's ability to connect with a passionate crowd on the mic, his marketability and whether he could be in the industry long enough to be profitable.\n\nAnd when Cena started taking more time away from wrestling in 2015 and working a reduced schedule, Mr Thurston feels there was a \"decline\" in the WWE product.\n\nOther wrestling experts have suggested Cena's presence over the years helped slow the slide of WWE ratings trending downwards which, according to analysis by wrestling site PWtorch, saw average viewership for its flagship weekly Raw programme fall by a million between 2010 and 2015, to 3.7m.\n\nHaving achieved so much within wrestling, Cena could \"just come in and be a wrestler and walk out\", adds Dr Gillian Brooks, associate professor in marketing at King's Business School, but instead she says he built a personal brand that comes across as real.\n\nAmong the brands Cena has worked with is Neutrogena, becoming the face of its sunscreen campaign after revealing he had skin cancer spots - which he attributed to his own lack of sun protection use.\n\nHe also holds the Guinness World Record for the number of wishes granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with more than 650 fulfilled wishes for children with critical illnesses. It's a partnership he revealed had started by \"accident\", but one he's kept since 2002, describing it as \"the coolest thing\".\n\n\"If you think about it from a child's perspective, they're seeing someone that they've seen on TV watching WWE or in films, and they suddenly get to meet him,\" Dr Brooks says. \"The fact that he's doing charity work, he's written a children's book, been in films, made music… all these things illustrate that he's not a one show pony.\n\n\"It's coming across in a way that's very authentic and very sort of pure to who he is.\"\n\nBoth Cena's personal brand and his charisma are set to live on, but his time in the ring looks to have come to an end after Cena announced last year that 2025 would be his last as a competitor.\n\nExplaining his reasoning at the time, he told of the physical toll wrestling had taken on his body.\n\nHis career has seen him undergo several operations, including on his neck, pec and triceps, with Cena saying in interviews that his \"body hurts\" and is \"screaming to close the chapter\".\n\nWhile the old saying \"never say never\" is a popular one, Cena has repeatedly said he will be \"100% done\" - and has received rousing receptions around the world for his final appearances.\n\nOverall, fan Joe is happy with Cena's \"retirement run\", with matches against old rivals such as AJ Styles, Randy Orton and CM Punk, and newer stars including Dominik Mysterio and Gunther.\n\nHe does feel the \"execution\" of his final year could have been better though, with Cena's short-term \"heel turn\" (becoming a villain) at the Elimination Chamber event in March drawing criticism.\n\n\"It could have been handled better,\" Joe says. \"[But] he's had such a unique distinction of having a retirement run that no one's ever had before.\n\n\"It's very sad to see him retire now. But I think he said it himself - it's the right time.\"\n\nNot that WWE fans will never see Cena again; he has signed a five-year deal to be an ambassador for the company.\n\nHaving won The Last Time Is Now tournament, it's former world heavyweight champion Gunther who will face Cena in his final fight.\n\nWith it not being broadcast on terrestrial TV, but rather on streaming platforms, it's been reported that there is no time limit on the match - and Gunther, who has never wrestled Cena before, has been giving much tough talk.\n\nOne thing's for sure: \"You Can't See Me\" might be the taunt Cena gives Gunther, but the last fight will be seen and remembered by many.\n\nGrand Theft Auto made him a legend. His latest game was a disaster\n\nSo bad they're good - why do we love terrible films?\n\nWhy Indiana Jones, Barbie and other US films were shot in UK",

The Wildcats scored 21 in the final frame to take down the undefeated Golden Eagles.\n\nFruita came out firing and led 31-17 at the half. Alivia Hopkins was one of the reasons why.

    "fullText": "MARRERO, La. (WGNO) – Archbishop Shaw has reached consecutive state championship games for the first time since 2008 thanks to Ethan Lentz. During the Eagles semi-finals matchup against Vandebilt Catholic, Lentz recorded 12 tackles, one sack and two interceptions, including a pick six, to punch Shaw’s ticket back to the title game.\n\n“We needed to play together to get the job done and make it back to the dome. We did practice hard, play hard all together as one,” Lentz said.\n\nLentz’s performance was no fluke though. The linebacker has six interceptions on the year, and head coach Hank Tierney has seen a ballhawk star manning the second level of his defense.\n\n“He finds the ball. He’s very physical, and he’s gotten better each year. He has good hands, and he’s got six and probably had a chance to get 2 or 3 more. He’s been a big playmaker for us the whole year,” Tierney added.\n\nWhile Lentz has been finishing his third year on the westbank, the linebacker gew up modeling his game after John Ehret alums De’Jon ‘Scoota’ Harris and former LSU Tiger MIchael Divinity.\n\n“I wanted to be like them in every way. They were like my idols. It’s a great feeling: Trying to chase the same success they had and also trying to make my own path,” the junior explained.\n\nLentz’s path began with his father who not only coached at John Ehret but has been on Shaw’s staff, since before Tierney’s return to the westbank.\n\n“He played football his whole life. His dad play football at De La Salle. He came up in a football family, and we knew about him because the dad was on the staff, when I came here. We’re happy to have him: Tough kid that makes a lot of plays,” Tierney finished.\n\nArchbishop Shaw’s Ethan Lentz is our Friday Night Football Best Chevrolet Best Player of the Week.\n\nStay up to date with the latest news, weather and sports by downloading the WGNO app on the Apple or Google Play stores and by subscribing to the WGNO newsletter.\n\nFNF Best Chevrolet Best Player of the Week: Archbishop Shaw’s Ethan Lentz\n\nFNF Championship: Dunham captures Division III Select title after dominating Calvary Baptist, 34-17\n\nFNF Championship: Haynesville wins Division IV Non-Select title after posting close 39-37 win over Mangham\n\nFNF Championship: Riverside Academy secures Division IV Select Championship Title after beating Ascension Catholic, 31-21\n\nFNF Championship: Iowa wins Division II Non-Select title after winning shootout over North Desoto, 50-43",

    "fullText": "LINCOLN, Neb. (Courtesy of Nebraska Huskers Athletics) – The No. 1 Nebraska volleyball team cruised into the NCAA Regional Finals with a 25-12, 25-11, 25-12 sweep of No. 16 Kansas on Friday night in front of a crowd of 8,800 at John Cook Arena at the Bob Devaney Sports Center.\n\nThe Huskers (33-0) were dominant from start to finish, never trailing in the match. NU hit .450 – its third-highest attack percentage of the year – and stifled the Jayhawks (24-11) to a season-low .029 hitting percentage. Nebraska also out-blocked Kansas, 10-1, out-dug the Jayhawks 48-30 and had six services aces and only three errors while KU had one ace and six errors.\n\nNebraska’s middles were dominant, combining for 21 kills on 28 error-free swings (.750 attack percentage) while adding eight blocks. Rebekah Allick had nine kills on nine swings to hit 1.000, and she added three blocks. Andi Jackson also had nine kills on .600 hitting with five blocks. Manaia Ogbechie produced three kills on four swings in the third set.\n\nHarper Murray added seven kills and had a match-high 10 digs. Bergen Reilly dished out 30 assists while Olivia Mauch had a season-high three aces.\n\nThree players led Kansas with six kills.\n\nSet 1: NU got off to a 4-0 start on Choboy’s serve with a kill by Allick and two blocks by Jackson, one with Adriano and one with Murray. After Kansas got on the board, NU scored a 6-0 run with Mauch serving a pair of aces to go up 10-1. Jackson’s fourth block – with Reilly – and a kill by the junior middle blocker made it 13-3 Big Red. The Jayhawks scored three in a row to cut it to 13-6, but four kills by Allick put NU ahead 18-7. Landfair set Allick for her sixth kill on six swings, and a solo block by the senior middle blocker made it 21-8. Jackson and Landfair tacked on kills for a 25-12 win.      \n\nSet 2: Adriano had an early kill and an ace, and Murray and Jackson each posted a kill and a block together as the Huskers built a 7-3 lead. KU pulled within 9-7, but a Murray kill started a 5-0 run with Allick providing two kills and a block with Adriano. The lead grew to 10 at 19-9 after a block by Allick and Adriano and a kill by Murray. An Adriano kill made it 20-9, and Jackson and Murray teamed up for a block and a 22-11 lead. The Huskers closed out a 25-11 win on a Choboy ace.\n\nSet 3: Sigler had two kills, and Landfair and Jackson pounded away for a 9-4 NU lead. Landfair tacked on another kill before one by Manaia Ogbechie put NU ahead 13-6. Ogbechie, Murray and Jackson added kills, and Murray served an ace to help the Huskers go up 20-9. NU went on to finish the sweep, 25-12.\n\nUp Next: Nebraska will take on No. 6 Texas A&M in Sunday’s NCAA Regional Final at 2 p.m. on ABC. The Aggies beat No. 9 Louisville, 3-2 in a reverse sweep, in the first match on Friday.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska advanced to an NCAA Regional Final for the 34th time in program history. The Huskers’ 34 regional final appearances are the most in NCAA history. Nebraska has made an NCAA Regional Final in 13 of the past 14 seasons.\n\nThe Huskers played their 175th NCAA Tournament match tonight. Nebraska and Stanford are the only two programs to play 175 NCAA Tournament matches.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska improved to 137-38 all-time in the NCAA Tournament. The Huskers rank second in NCAA history in postseason wins and winning percentage (.783).\n\nThe win was Nebraska’s 33rd consecutive victory. The Huskers are 33-0 this season, marking the third straight season Nebraska has won 33 matches. The 33 wins tie for the second-most victories in a season by a Husker team in the NCAA era (1981-present).\n\nNebraska improved to 34-7 all-time in NCAA Regional Semifinal matches, including a 17-1 record in matches played in Lincoln.\n\nThe Huskers improved to 90-7 all-time in home NCAA Tournament matches, including a 35-2 record at the Devaney Center.\n\nNebraska has won 90 home matches in the NCAA Tournament while only four other schools have 90 or more total victories in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNU has won 29 consecutive home matches in the NCAA Tournament, a school record.\n\nOverall, Nebraska has won 63 consecutive home matches dating back to Dec. 1, 2022. That ties for the fifth-longest streak in NCAA Division I history and ties for the second-longest streak in Husker history.\n\nWith the win, Nebraska improved to 13-0 against ranked opponents this season. The 13 victories against ranked opponents are tied for second in school history, one shy of the school record (14 in 1998).\n\nNebraska won the first two sets and is now 106-2 all-time in the NCAA Tournament when taking a 2-0 lead.\n\nNebraska was the first to 20 points in each of the three sets. The Huskers are now 95-0 this season in sets when reaching 20 points first.\n\nThe Huskers held Kansas to fewer than 15 points in all three sets. That marked the second time this season that Nebraska has held its opponents to fewer than 15 points in every set, with both occurrences coming against top-25 teams (also against No. 25 Penn State on Nov. 28).\n\nNebraska won the first set, 25-12. That marked the Huskers’ 46th consecutive set won at home this season. That is a school record for consecutive sets won at home in one season, eclipsing the 45 consecutive home sets won by the 2004 team.\n\nOverall, Nebraska has now won 48 consecutive sets at home which ties for the second-longest streak in school history, trailing only the 52 consecutive home sets won spanning the 2001-02 seasons.\n\nNebraska stuffed four of Kansas’ first 11 swings of the night, recording four blocks in the first eight rallies. The Huskers had as many blocks in the match’s first 15 rallies (5) as they did in their second-round sweep of Kansas State last Saturday.\n\nFueled by the block, Nebraska won 13 of the first 16 rallies of the match to take a 13-3 lead.\n\nNebraska finished with 10 blocks in the match, tying for its highest block total in 13 matches.\n\nThe Huskers hit .450 in the match, its third-highest attack percentage this season. Two of Nebraska’s three matches this season hitting .450 or better have come in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNebraska has now hit above .400 in nine matches this season, the most in a single season in the rally-scoring era (2001-present).\n\nThe Huskers played three middle blockers in the match in Rebekah Allick, Andi Jackson and Manaia Ogbechie. The middles combined for 21 kills on 28 error-free swings. Allick had a kill on each of her nine swings.\n\nAllick also had three blocks in the match, increasing her career total to 539 blocks and moving into 10th place on Nebraska’s all-time blocks list.\n\nHarper Murray had seven kills in the match, increasing her career total to 1,156. She passed Lexi Sun and moved into 10th place on Nebraska’s career kills list in the rally-scoring era.\n\nOlivia Mauch had a season-high three aces in the match.\n\nNebraska limited Kansas to a season-low .029 attack percentage. The Jayhawks’ previous low was a .104 hitting percentage against Kansas State on Oct. 24.\n\nThe Huskers have held 15 opponents under a .100 hitting percentage this season.\n\nKansas did not have a block until the 31st rally of the third set. The Jayhawks finished with one block, marking the third time this season a Husker opponent has totaled only one block.",

    "fullText": "Jeremiyah Love mock draft projection: Where will Notre Dame RB get picked in 2026 NFL Draft? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nJeremiyah Love has put together two similar monster years as Notre Dame's top running back. His 2025 campaign earned him a trip to New York as a Heisman Trophy finalist.\n\nAfter amassing 2,497 rushing yards and scoring 35 touchdowns the past two seasons, averaging 6.9 yards per carry, Love has emerged as the clear best running back prospect for the 2026 NFL draft.\n\nHere's breaking down Love's talented skill set and how high he can go as a first-round pick when he's selected on April 23:\n\nMORE: The case for and against Jeremiyah Love for the Heisman\n\nLove (6-0, 214) is a well-built power back who also has great explosiveness to reel off long runs. His experience and consistency should make the St. Louis native have a smooth transition to the NFL\n\nLove is a complete back. He's got the power to run well through initial tackles and get tough chunks between the tackles. He's also got the breakaway speed to bounce any run to the outside or open field and go the distance with any touch. He is smart and reads his blocks well, showing exceptional balance, vision and patience. Although he wasn't used a lot as a receiver, he has the good hands to be a difference-maker in the passing game, extending from his rushing assets.\n\nLove might need to get a little stronger to hold up as the same type of power back in the NFL. Like most rookies coming into the NFL, pass blocking will become a greater emphasis to ensure he can stay on the field for three downs.\n\nMORE: College football bowl picks, predictions for CFP games\n\nAlvin Kamara is nearing the end at 31. The Saints have a lot of needs as a rebuilding team, but if they don't go defense or offensive line, Love would be a strong pick for offensive-minded Kellen Moore, who produced a career year out of Saquon Barkley in the Eagles' Super Bowl-winning run last season. Love's home-run attributes would add a needed fresh legs element.\n\nBetween Brian Robinson Jr., Austin Ekeler getting hurt and the team mashing up a committee of Chris Rodriguez Jr., Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Jeremy McNichols, the Commanders need to clean up their backfield and give Jayden Daniels a worthy, healthy young running mate. Adding Love would be much like the Lamar Jackson-Derrick Henry older duo that smashed for the nearby Ravens in 2024.\n\nThe Cardinals saw James Conner break down from his volume and backup Trey Benson also couldn't stay healthy, leaving an ineffective mixed fill-in bag of Bam Knight, Emari Demercado and Michael Carter. Conner will turn 31 in May and has plenty of wear. Love would be the ideal replacement to help whoever's the QB.\n\nMORE: Where Jeremiyah Love projects in SN's latest mock draft\n\nThe Jets may be trending toward moving on from Breece Hall, a pending free agent. Or they could try to keep Hall and draft someone for a dangerous 1-2 punch in the running game, given Aaron Glenn and Tanner Engstrand saw first-hand the major effect of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs to revive the Lions' offense. Either way, bringing some Love to New York would be an option, given the Jets have two first-rounders.\n\nThe Vikings have seen Aaron Jones and Jordan Mason toggle between injury issues and getting a more reliable running game would be huge to take pressure off J.J. McCarthy or whoever their starting QB will be. Love can also provide an extra explosive element for Kevin O'Connell to better open up the passing game.",

With form swings, injuries, and fierce rivalries in play, this gameweek promises intensity across every pitch.\n\nChelsea welcome Everton in what promises to be an unpredictable encounter.\n\nThe Blues have failed to win any of their last three league games and also suffered defeat to Atalanta on Tuesday. This poor run has seen them slip out of the top four.\n\nEverton, meanwhile, have been on the rise, winning four of their last five matches.\n\nKey to this resurgence is Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who has scored or assisted in four of those five games.\n\nChelsea will be without Moisés Caicedo due to suspension and Liam Delap due to injury. Everton welcome back Idrissa Gana Gueye and Thierno Barry from suspension, with Barry also passed fit.\n\nThe major news from Arne Slot’s prematch press conference was his plan to speak with talisman Mo Salah, with the outcome determining Salah’s availability for this clash.\n\nA vital Champions League win away to Inter Milan should give the Reds much-needed confidence.\n\nBrighton rescued a point through a late Georginio Rutter goal against West Ham last week.\n\nThe Seagulls are level on points with Liverpool and have lost just one of their last five matches.\n\nFor Liverpool, Wataru Endo and Cody Gakpo are ruled out, while Alexander Isak is a doubt.\n\nBrighton welcome back Kaoru Mitoma, James Milner, Yasin Ayari, and Thomas Watson from injury.\n\nBurnley will be eager to snap a run of five consecutive defeats when they host Fulham at Turf Moor on Saturday.\n\nTheir terrible form has seen them fall to 19th, with just ten points from a possible 45.\n\nBurnley will be without Lucas Pires and Kyle Walker due to suspension.\n\nFulham suffered a second straight defeat last week against Crystal Palace.\n\nThe Cottagers have struggled recently, winning just two of their last five and sliding into the bottom half. Antonee Robinson will face a late fitness test.\n\nArsenal welcome Wolves to the Emirates in what is expected to be a straightforward affair.\n\nThe Gunners will be eager to respond after last week’s last-minute league defeat against Aston Villa.\n\nTheir Champions League win over Club Brugge allowed them to rest key players ahead of this fixture.\n\nArsenal will be without Cristhian Mosquera and Max Dowman due to injury, while William Saliba, Declan Rice, Jurrien Timber, and Leandro Trossard are doubts. Riccardo Calafiori is suspended.\n\nWolves have struggled mightily and are unlikely to reverse their form this weekend.\n\nThe bottom-placed side have lost their last five games and have only two points after 15 matches. João Gomes returns from suspension, while Marshall Munetsi is ruled out.\n\nCrystal Palace take on Manchester City in what could be a difficult test for the visitors.\n\nThe Eagles have lost just once in their last five matches and sit only five points behind City.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta, Jaydee Canvot, and Ismaïla Sarr are doubts, while Ismailar Sarr is ruled out.\n\nManchester City secured a huge Champions League win over Real Madrid on Wednesday—their fourth straight victory in all competitions.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side has shifted into another gear recently, scoring freely and grinding out results. City could move into the top spot this weekend if Arsenal fail to beat Wolves.\n\nNottingham Forest will be without Yates, Wood, Awoniyi, Gunn, and Aina, while first-choice goalkeeper Matz Sels is still being monitored.\n\nOn the bright side, Murillo, Luiz, Zinchenko, and Bakwa all returned in the Europa League on Tuesday.\n\nForest returned to winning ways on Thursday against FC Utrecht after a disappointing 3–0 loss to Everton last week.\n\nSpurs welcome back Brennan Johnson after he missed the Brentford match through injury.\n\nSpurs grabbed a much-needed victory in that game, halting a run of four league matches without a win.\n\nSunderland suffered a 3–0 defeat against Manchester City last week, dropping into ninth place.\n\nThe newly promoted side has been a revelation this season, climbing as high as third at one point.\n\nTheir meeting with Newcastle promises to be a fiery affair, with both teams known for their physical, high-energy style.\n\nNewcastle have won three of their last four league games, including a 2–1 victory over Burnley last week.\n\nThis run has moved them within one point of tenth-placed Liverpool. Joelinton is a doubt due to injury.\n\nWest Ham’s 1–1 draw with Brighton last week was their third stalemate in four games, leaving them in 18th place—two points behind Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe Hammers need to begin turning draws into wins if they hope to avoid a relegation battle in the second half of the season.\n\nAston Villa strengthened their resurgence with a late winner against league leaders Arsenal last week.\n\nThe Villains have now won five consecutive matches and sit just three points behind the Gunners.\n\nEmiliano Martinez and Pau Torres are doubts with injuries.\n\nBrentford will be without suspended attacker Kevin Schade when they host Leeds at the Gtech Community Stadium on Sunday.\n\nReiss Nelson picked up a knock last week but is expected to be fit.\n\nBrentford have lost their last two league matches and currently sit 13th.\n\nLeeds have shown excellent spirit, securing a huge win against Chelsea and earning a draw against Liverpool in recent weeks to climb out of the relegation zone.\n\nThose results should give Daniel Farke’s side the confidence needed for this fixture.\n\nManchester United are eager to stop a trend that has seen Bournemouth win their last two matches at Old Trafford without conceding.\n\nThe Red Devils have lost just one of their last five, collecting three wins and a draw during that run.\n\nThe availability of Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui, and Amad Diallo remains unknown due to their potential AFCON involvement.\n\nBenjamin Sesko is a doubt, while Matthijs de Ligt is ruled out.\n\nBournemouth will be without Lewis Cook after his red card last week, while Tyler Adams returns from suspension.

Cathedral Caholic? Not so much. It's been all Bulldogs so far.\n\nAnd I to the mist….he was gone! That’s high school football’s best backup QB Brody Rudnicki who broke off his second TD run of the first quarter, a majestic 30-yard run, giving Folsom a 21-0 lead over Cathedral Catholic with 44 seconds left in the 1Q. Rudnicki also has TD pass. pic.twitter.com/azhjJHOeUI\n\n— Mitch Stephens (@MitchBookLive) December 13, 2025\n\nWell, the fog is stopping Folsom from being aggressive in the passing game.

    "fullText": "I am currently building a hobby project:\npyk/bench, a microbenchmarking library for Zig.\nMy goal is to make it fast and accurate. To measure performance properly,\nlooking at wall clock time is not enough. I need to know what the CPU is\nactually doing.\n\nI want to measure CPU cycles, instruction counts and cache misses. On Linux the\nkernel provides a system call for this named\nperf_event_open.\nIt is very powerful but the API is raw and not easy to use safely.\n\nThe perf_event_open system call creates a file descriptor that allows\nmeasuring performance information. You fill out a perf_event_attr struct with\nthe config you want, such as PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES or\nPERF_COUNT_HW_INSTRUCTIONS, and the kernel gives you back a file descriptor.\n\nYou can read from this file descriptor to get the counts. The format of the data\nyou read depends on how you opened it.\n\nYou can also group events. This is important because it lets you measure\nmultiple things at once with a single read call. One event acts as the “group\nleader” and others are “siblings”. When you read from the leader, you get a\nbinary layout containing values for all events in the group.\n\nThe layout looks roughly like this in C:\n\nThis is dynamic. The size of the struct changes based on how many events you\nhave. In Zig I want something static and type-safe.\n\nMy first attempt was brittle. I hardcoded a struct with the fields I thought I\nwould need.\n\nThis works but it is dangerous. The Measurements struct is hardcoded.\n\nIf I change the initialization logic to add “branch misses”, I have to remember\nto update Measurements, update the ids array size and update the read\nfunction manually. The compiler cannot help me here.\n\nIf I access ids[2] but only initialized 2 events, I crash or get garbage data.\n\nZig allows running code at compile time to generate types. I can use this to\ngenerate a struct that exactly matches the events I request.\n\nI defined an Event enum for the things I want to measure.\n\nThen I wrote a function that takes a slice of these events and returns a new\ntype.\n\nThis function creates a struct with fields named after the enum tags. If I pass\n&.{ .cpu_cycles, .instructions }, it generates:\n\nNow I can create a generic Group type that uses this.\n\nThe usage is cleaner and safer.\n\nIf I try to access a field I did not request, the compiler stops me.\n\nHere is how the full version looks like:\n\nTo implement this I needed to get the ID of the event from the file descriptor.\nThe kernel documentation says to use ioctl with PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID.\n\nI checked std.os.linux in the Zig standard library and it was missing.\n\nSo I opened a pull request to add it. It is just a one line change.\n\nYou can see the PR here:\nhttps://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/pulls/30162.\nI am not sure if it will be accepted but it felt good to fix a missing piece in\nthe tool I use.",

    "fullText": "A coalition of blue states is suing the Trump administration over its fee of $100,000 for H-1B Visas, several Democratic attorneys general announced on Friday.\n\nThe Trump administration announced in September that it would be implementing the fee for H-1B visas, citing that the program for the visas is overused. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, joined by Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and New York Attorney General Letitia James and others, is leading the suit.\n\nH-1B visas allow foreign professionals to seek work in professions that are considered to be more specialized. Applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree or a similar equivalent to be eligible for the visa.\n\nThe liberal attorneys general allege that new policy and fee, which is implemented by the Department of Homeland Security, is out of bounds of what is authorized by Congress for the program.\n\n“Congress has refined this program, setting caps, establishing fees, enhancing enforcement and strengthening protections, but what Congress has never done is authorize a president to impose a six-figure surcharge designed to dismantle the program entirely,” Bonta said at a press conference on Friday.\n\nBonta said the visa fee will create financial burdens on state and private employers, creating a barrier to filling job vacancies.\n\nHe also underscored just how many employees in the United States rely on the H-1B visa program, citing the thousands of health care professionals, educators and researchers, among other occupations, that use the program. Bonta claimed nearly 30,000 educators nationwide hold an H-1B visa, and 17,000 H-1B visa holders last year were health care professionals.\n\nBonta said during the press conference the state of California has filed 49 lawsuits against the Trump administration since they took office in January.\n\n“The bottom line is, no presidential administration can rewrite immigration law,” Bonta said. “No president can destabilize our schools, our hospitals and universities on a whim, and no president can ignore the co-equal branch of government, of Congress, ignore the Constitution or ignore the law.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on the lawsuit. The Justice Department declined to comment.",

    "fullText": "Hi Ben, you might find this preprint of interest https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17395 Perhaps you are making similar points.\n\nIt is curious that machine learning folks, who often like to say they are \"data driven\" pay little attention to the data at a conceptual level. I think the issue is that the data is taken to be _given_ (as you allude -- someone \"gives you\" a bunch of data). The word \"data\" derives from the latin word (dare) meaning to give. We would be better served to think of capta.... but collecting data is not considered as sexy as making complex models.\n\nOne argument (that simply is wrong) is that the existence of distributions is justified by the \"law\" of large numbers. It is not. For an argument regarding this, and an alternative (to distributions), you might find this other paper of interest. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X24000355 It shows what you get when you don't assume the \"law\" of large numbers holds (i.e. that relative frequencies converge). That the result is something other folks had studied for some time is pretty interesting. That coherent upper previsions arise elsewhere in ML (in fairness, DRO and even in SVMs!) suggests they are not so weird after all....\n\nA common viewpoint is that there is a set of all possible data out there (e.g., all images on the web). We collect a subset of these data and train our model. The main (and likely unreasonable) assumption is that the training subset is an iid sample (or uniformly sampled w/o replacement) from the set of all possible data. This assumption is the central ingredient in theoretical generalization bounds. While it's probably not perfectly reasonable, it does give us a framework for comparing models and algorithms, and aligns with common practices like hold-out validation. I think this is a useful model of the (training) data-generating distribution.",

    "description": "Marco Rubio has spoken—get out of here, Calibri!",
    "fullText": "Marco Rubio here, with an important announcement: No more Calibri in official State Department communications! Get out of here with your ungarnished lines and provocatively naked terminals! The Biden administration may have shot the serif, switching from Times New Roman on the grounds that serif-less fonts such as Calibri are more accessible to readers with disabilities. That’s all over now.\n\n The State Department Action Request reads: “To restore decorum and professionalism to the Department’s written work products and abolish yet another wasteful DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility] program, the Department is returning to Times New Roman as its standard typeface.”\n\n Now you can read a sentence like “Yes, the United States did just seize an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela! Don’t worry about it,” and bask in the sense of absolute decorum that comes from seeing a little serif on all of the relevant letters.\n\nSome further updates to our font preferences:\n\nThe Justice Department will be switching to Comic Sans because current fonts have a veneer of professionalism that feels out of place in communications written by Lindsey Halligan. Now all “fundamental misstatements of law” (a judge’s words, not ours!) will be in a font where they will feel more at home.\n\nThe Department of Transportation is switching to Goudy Old Style to fix everyone’s biggest problem with air travel: pajamasThe fonts aren’t square enough!\n\nIt will also be phasing out Clearview on road signs, on the grounds that this typeface is entirely too legible. Legibility is DEIA at work. People should struggle to read. This is also why we are dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nAlso, NASA is going to be using the logo font, where the A’s all look like upside-down V’s, for all communications, just to create an extra challenge for its already-overworked scientists. AAAAAA!\n\nThe Treasury Department will be switching to Akkadian cuneiform in honor of Ea-Nasir, our Businessman of the Month! The Trump administration shares his values. We are phasing out the penny, but one thing we’re not phasing out? Quality copper! Just buy some! And if you want to complain about it, write to us in Akkadian cuneiform!\n\nThe FBI is communicating entirely in Wingdings; this is because Kash Patel clicked something by mistake and is not actually policy.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is getting rid of Futura and bringing back our medieval gothic blackletter favorites with a switch to Fraktur. “What do you mean, you’re bringing our medieval fonts back? What medieval fonts? What country do you think this is?” Germany, right? 1930s, right? If not, we’re going to be very embarrassed. In general, when selecting a font or making any other kind of design choice, think, Would this look out of place on a Leni Riefenstahl film poster?\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department is switching entirely to Papyrus. Finally, a font as embarrassing and unscientific as our ideas. When you read a press release saying that vaccinations are no longer recommended, now it’ll be in a font that looks like it’s advertising tropical-drink specials or chakra alignment.\n\nThe Department of Labor will switch to handwriting. Just to create more labor.\n\nThe Department of War will not be updating its fonts at this time. Instead, it will be switching from written to verbal communications. This isn’t because we are worried that some of our orders might not be legal. It’s—call and we’ll explain. Just call. Or you can probably reach Pete Hegseth on Signal.",

    "title": "Ozempic Turned a 1970s Hit into an Inescapable Jingle (2024)",
    "description": "The diabetes drug has become a phenomenon, and “Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic!” — a takeoff of the Pilot song “Magic” — has played a big part in its story.",
    "fullText": "In February 2023, David Paton, guitar case in hand, strode across the most famous pedestrian walkway in rock history and into London’s Abbey Road Studios.\n\nPaton was no stranger to the rooms where the Beatles changed the course of popular music: His 1970s pop-rock band Pilot recorded two albums there. In his second life, as an in-demand studio and touring musician for the likes of Kate Bush and Elton John, he clocked numerous sessions with the prog-rock outfit the Alan Parsons Project, whose namesake produced Pilot’s signature hit, “Magic.” He even spent some time there with his boyhood hero, Paul McCartney, singing backup vocals on Wings’ “Mull of Kintyre.”\n\nPaton had come to London to record a new version of “Magic.” “It was a great thrill to be back at Abbey Road, singing my song,” he said in a recent video interview from his home studio in Edinburgh, an array of guitars displayed behind him. The track’s stair-step chorus — “Oh, oh, oh/it’s MAAA-gic” — could test Paton’s vocal range even back in 1974, and again a year later, when the song became a worldwide hit, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n“It’s just about the enjoyment of life,” he said. “About waking up in the morning, you know? I was 22 when I wrote it.” Now he was 73, and unsure if he could still reach those high notes. But Paton took his place in front of the Abbey Road microphone and confidently sang that indelible hook, only with the word “magic” swapped out for something less ephemeral and more pharmaceutical: “Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic.”\n\nAs television viewers are all too aware, that altered chorus from “Magic” serves as the advertising jingle for the Type 2 diabetes medication Ozempic. Since the product arrived in 2018, the bowdlerized version of “Magic” — first rerecorded by work-for-hire musicians, and then re-rerecorded by Paton at Abbey Road — has taken its place alongside such classics of the form as Subway’s “Five Dollar Foot Long” and McDonald’s “I’m Lovin’ It” as marvels of marketing ingenuity.\n\n“It’s an earworm all right,” said David Allan, a professor of marketing at Saint Joseph’s University and the author of “This Note’s for You,” a book about music and advertising. “You can’t get it out of your head.”\n\nThose three seconds of AM-radio bliss — “It’s just a first, a third and a fifth note,” Paton modestly explained — have played a pivotal role in the Ozempic story. Its parent company, Novo Nordisk, has now become Europe’s most valuable public company, with a market cap of nearly $570 billion.\n\nOzempic, of course, has become much more than a diabetes drug: Its “off label” use to treat obesity has sparked a “weight-loss revolution,” as Oprah Winfrey called it in her March TV special dedicated to an emerging group of diabetes and anti-obesity medications. Buttressed by an ad spend of $120 million over just the first seven months of 2023, according to MediaRadar, Ozempic’s Q rating is such that the brand now stands in for an entire category of product, as Viagra does for erectile dysfunction drugs. On the March 30 episode of “Saturday Night Live,” the comedian Ramy Youssef appeared in a spoof commercial for “Ozempic for Ramadan” that featured the familiar “Oh, oh, oh” of “Magic.”\n\nThis Ozempic boom is due in no small part to the jingle, which helped turn a byzantine mash-up of syllables into a brand patients would request from doctors by name. Jeremy Shepler, who headed the Ozempic launch in the United States for Novo Nordisk, had previously enjoyed success deploying music in a commercial for a new-to-market nasal spray, and knew he wanted to find a song that worked both mnemonically and emotionally.\n\n“The first song I came up with was by New Kids on the Block, the one that goes ‘Oh oh oh oh oh’,” he sang, referring to “You Got It (The Right Stuff).” “But New Kids was a bit too young,” he said. “The average age of our patient was between 50 and 55. Then it came to me: ‘Oh, oh, oh, it’s magic.’”\n\nThat snippet of a chorus not only seared the “O” in Ozempic into consumers’ temporal lobes, but its cheerfulness sold the promise of the drug: to “help people get back to a level of health when their life was bright and their future was optimistic,” said Jeff Rothstein, chief executive of CultHealth, the ad agency for Ozempic. Also, baby boomers exposed to the jingle would subconsciously hear the missing word “magic,” which, said Shepler, helped reinforce the drug’s transformative quality.\n\nNovo licensed the song from Sony Music Publishing, and Rothstein hired a music production house to record the brand-specific version of “Magic.” When they tested a rough version of the commercial, “It was the highest scoring ad we’d ever seen,” Shepler said.\n\nAs the spot first began airing in 2018 (direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising is allowed only in the United States and New Zealand), Paton wasn’t even aware that “Magic” had been licensed for the advert. “I learned about it through Facebook,” he said. “Fans would write me, ‘I’m hearing “Magic” every 20 minutes on my TV’.”\n\nPaton and Billy Lyall, his Pilot bandmate who died in 1989 at age 36, share a co-writing credit on “Magic,” and split the revenue generated by the composition with Sony Publishing. (Songs generate multiple income streams, some based on the performance or master recording, some based on the songwriting. In this case, since the original recording of “Magic” was not used by Novo Nordisk, Pilot’s record label, Warner Music Group, was not involved.)\n\nAs is common practice in the music industry, Sony was not obligated to receive permission from the songwriters to license the song. Not that Paton minded: Three music-industry executives, asked separately to assess the value of the Ozempic deal, said it was most likely worth seven figures to Paton. (Paton, Sony Music Publishing and Novo Nordisk all declined to discuss financial terms of the deal.)\n\nThe Ozempic commercial “is another example of why classic, iconic music catalogs are great investments,” said Jon Singer, chairman of Spirit Music Group, a music publishing company with a repertoire that includes songs by the Who, Chicago, Toto and T. Rex.\n\n“Music as an asset can have multiple lives,” added Billy Mann, a Grammy-nominated songwriter and longtime publishing executive. “There’s a ‘comfort food’ feeling of nostalgia that hit songs can trigger. They’re time machines.”\n\nIn the Spotify era, older songs have spiked in value, as consumers repeatedly press play on the songs of their youth. For artists, those fractions of a penny eventually add up, and that has helped create a gold rush for veteran acts looking to sell their music catalogs. “There’s a finite number of songs that have proven to be iconic for 40 or 50 years,” said Bill Werde, the director of the Bandier music business program at Syracuse University and the author of the industry newsletter “Full Rate No Cap.” “Those songs have special value on the marketplace.”\n\nLicensing a song for a commercial may be seen by some as antithetical to the countercultural spirit of rock ’n’ roll. “There have always been protectors of the flame who, when certain songs get used in certain moments, aggressively clutch their pearls,” Werde said. “But there’s very little evidence that this has ever harmed any artist.” He pointed to the Beatles licensing their utopian “All You Need Is Love” to Luvs diapers in 2007 as perhaps the most egregious example of an advertiser co-opting a song’s original meaning. “But no one really cared. It was Ob-la-di. Life goes on.”\n\nSimon Allaway, 52, an Ozempic user and Chicago-based computer programmer and musician, loves the “Magic” spot. “I can’t help but sing along to it,” he said. “It’s a perfect fit with the product.” Another user wrote in a message-board post that whenever she injects herself, her father sings “Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic.”\n\n“Magic” has been leased plenty of times before, for a Coca-Cola commercial — “I actually sang ‘Coke, Coke, Coke, it’s Magic’ back in the ’70s,” Paton recalled — for the 2005 Disney film “Herbie: Fully Loaded” and as the musical bed for Flo Rida’s 2009 single, also called “Magic,” to name a few. “People always want to use the song in some way or the other,” Paton said.\n\nAsked if he was bothered by his song’s association with what turned out to be a lightning-rod product, he smiled and shook his head. “I was delighted! I’m a songwriter. I want to sell my music. A lot of people don’t know the name Pilot, but they know the Ozempic song.”\n\nFor musicians, the success of the Ozempic commercial could be a harbinger of big checks to come. Pharmaceutical companies have seemingly unlimited budgets to promote their wares: according to the media analytics firm Guideline, pharma surpassed tech and auto in 2023 to become the second largest industry for ad spending, behind only consumer packaged goods.\n\nAlready, Lady Gaga is a spokesperson for Pfizer’s migraine medication Nurtec ODT; Cyndi Lauper lends her distinct Brooklyn accent to a commercial for Cosentyx, which treats plaque psoriasis; John Legend and Charlie Puth pitch Pfizer’s Covid vaccine and boosters. The Jackson 5’s “ABC” propels ads for Trelegy (used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), while commercials for the heart drug Entresto are soundtracked by Sonny & Cher’s “The Beat Goes On.”\n\nBut those spots haven’t embedded themselves into pop culture the way “Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic” has.\n\n“In contemporary advertising, campaigns tend to have pretty short shelf lives,” CultHealth’s Rothstein said. “Two, three years, tops. Yet ‘Oh, oh, oh, Ozempic’ continues to endure. You can do all the market research in the world, and never end up with something like this.”\n\nAudio produced by Sarah Diamond.",

    "description": "A 2,000-year-old tomb discovered contained the remains of a Roman soldier identified as Flaccus after his nickname was seen on a terra sigillata bowl.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA 2,000-year-old tomb discovered in Heerlen, Netherlands, contained the remains of a Roman soldier.\n\nThe site was first believed to be a cellar, but was determined to be a tomb after the discovery of an assortment of burial artifacts.\n\nThe soldier was identified as Flaccus after his nickname was seen on a terra sigillata bowl.\n\nDuring an ADC ArcheoProjecten excavation near the town’s Raadhuisplein—translated as Town Hall Square—a team of archaeologists found what initially looked to be a cellar. But after further exploration, they found it was rife with bronze pieces, pottery, terra sigillata bowls and plates, and, most significantly, cremated remains—not exactly something you store in a cellar.\n\nThey realized they had stumbled upon an ancient tomb, and it didn’t take long to figure out whose.\n\nThe clay bowls held a key clue, as the abbreviation “FLAC” was engraved onto their sides, according to a statement from the town of Heerlen. The abbreviation serves as a nickname for Flaccus. Along with the bowl, the archaeologists found a personal bronze skin scraper and four different plates. The pottery, which comes from Italy, confirmed that Flaccus was a Roman soldier. “It is a unique find because it is not only the oldest Roman grave in Heerlen, but also because no name was known there before,” the statement reads.\n\nThe find was dated to the year 0 and is the “most unique evidence of Roman habitation at this location.” Researchers had not previously found a Roman grave for this period accompanied by a name in the region.\n\nThe tomb and its personal artifacts are some of the first true pieces of evidence of an early Roman presence in the area. The settlement, likely the area’s first from the Roman expansion, was known as Coriovallum, and the deceased Flaccus is now the oldest known name of an individual in the city’s history.\n\nThe Raadhuisplein, located near the historical roads Via Belgica and Via Traina, was likely also an important location in the middle of Coriovallum, which became Heerlen centuries later. It served as a connection between Germany and France, a crossroads that contained a Roman military presence. It later grew into a more civilian-focused town and public baths built between 50 and 70 A.D., discovered in Heerlen in 1940, are still the largest visible Roman ruins in the Netherlands, according to Archaeology Magazine.\n\nThe artifacts from the tomb will eventually go on display at the Roman Museum of Heerlen.\n\n“Evidence was found of Roman habitation in the time of Emperor Augusts,” said Jordy Clemens, Heerlen’s councilmember for culture and heritage, according to Archaeology Magazine. “A unique discovery that not only teaches us more about our past, but also shows how unique the story of Roman Heerlen is for the Netherlands.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI/SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Taiwan's tech-heavy stocks show few signs of slowing a rally even as AI bubble worries cast a shadow over global markets, underscoring home-grown confidence in the structural advantages in AI that foreign investors may have overlooked.\n\nTaiwan's benchmark index is poised to breach ​a record 30,000 points in 2026, investors say, extending a three-year surge that has seen the stock market nearly double as the island rides a wave of demand ‌for chips that power artificial intelligence.\n\nWhile foreign money worries about stretched AI valuations, Taiwanese investors have enthusiastically ploughed into the market.\n\nAnalysts say domestic investors are betting on Taiwan's unique position as the lynchpin of an AI supply chain, where ‌even increasing competition in the sector would only benefit Taiwanese firms, including TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker.\n\nOne major focus of anxiety around AI comes from uncertainty about Nvidia's ability to sustain its market dominance, with Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) emerging as a potentially more cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nBut it's a win-win scenario for Taiwan because the island is essential to supply chains of both the GPU and TPU, the building blocks of AI computing power.\n\n\"Taiwan is a major beneficiary of the AI market,\" said Piter Yang, a fund manager of Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust Co, citing the ⁠advantage of Taiwan being the world's semiconductor hub.\n\nAnd for now, as ‌a promising future fuels optimism, Taiwan markets and local investors seem relatively unfazed by the AI bubble fears, just as they remain calm in the face of rising geopolitical tensions with Beijing that have often spooked foreign investors.\n\nGains in Taiwan's market have also been underpinned ‍by earnings growth, leaving it with a reasonably steady price-to-earnings ratio of 21, below that of the Nasdaq and the Nikkei, meaning the rally has not made stocks more expensive.\n\n\"We are not worried about an AI bubble,\" said Li Fang-kuo, chairman of the securities investment arm of food conglomerate Uni-President. \"We are comfortable with where the valuations stand.\"\n\nLi pointed out that several of the magnificent seven companies in the U.S. have gross ​margins of as much as 70% or higher. \"So it's not comparable to the dot-com bubble, when companies were not generating meaningful earnings.\"",

    "title": "Tesla's latest launch isn't a car — it's a $350 pickleball paddle — and it's not even electric",
    "description": "Tesla has partnered with Selkirk to launch a $350 pickleball paddle \"optimized for high performance play.\"",
    "fullText": "From Elon Musk — the guy who brought the world a branded flamethrower — it somehow tracks that Tesla is now making pickleball paddles.\n\nThe EV company launched its latest lifestyle product on Friday: a $350 pickleball paddle created in partnership with Selkirk, a sports equipment company.\n\nThe paddle, made of carbon fiber with a foam core, was \"optimized for high-performance play,\" according to the product page.\n\n\"This wasn't simply a branding exercise. It was a true engineering collaboration,\" Selkirk's co-owner and director of research and development, Tom Barnes, said in a statement about the release. \"Tesla's design group and our R&D team spent more than a year trading data, refining geometry, and stress-testing prototypes.\"\n\nA Selkirk spokesperson told Business Insider that the paddle's creation was first conceptualized after a conversation at the 2023 USA Pickleball National Championships between Barnes and members of Tesla's engineering team.\n\nAfter Barnes delivered a custom batch of Tesla-themed paddles to the EV-maker's staff, Selkirk leaders visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California. While there, they connected with Javier Verdura, Tesla's global director of product design, who is an avid pickleball player, and began the design process.\n\nPrototypes were sent to Tesla for aerodynamics testing before the design was finalized.\n\nThe limited-run batch of the paddle sold out on Tesla's website in under three hours after its launch, a Selkirk spokesperson told Business Insider. Plans for a restock remain unclear.\n\nWhile the pickleball paddle is Tesla's first foray into traditional, non-electrified sports equipment, the automaker does offer a line of apparel and home products, like drinkware ($30+), backpacks ($185+), and salt and pepper shakers ($65).\n\nMusk's other business ventures have also leaned into collectible merchandise, such as the Boring Company's flamethrower, which went viral in 2018.\n\nTesla's lifestyle products are not listed as a separate line item in their financial reports, and there is no publicly available evidence to suggest that they have a significant impact on the company's finances. Tesla stock closed up more than 2% on Friday, but sank slightly in after-hours trading.\n\nPickleball, which combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong, has experienced explosive growth in popularity in recent years. The 2024 Pickleball Single Sport Report, released by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, found that participation has increased by 45.8% since 2023 — representing 311% growth over the past three years.\n\nIn that time, pickleball has transformed from a suburban hobby for the 55+ crowd into a popular activity and networking opportunity among Silicon Valley professionals.\n\nEntry-level equipment for the sport doesn't require a significant investment, with a basic paddle and ball running less than $50. However, since pickleball has gained traction among tech personalities like Bill Gates and celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, higher-end products have crept into the market.\n\nSome Selkirk models run upward of $150, while others, like the Aero Blade 1.19, cost $299 and up. The Aero Blade features a carbon fiber frame with a foam core, similar to that of the Tesla version.\n\nThe debut of the Tesla pickleball paddle elicited split reactions on social media, with some fans of the brand celebrating its release as a clever gift opportunity ahead of the holiday season. Others were quick to criticize the price point and Selkirk's strategy to partner with Tesla, rather than a well-known pickleball player or influencer.\n\n\"Selkirks out here like 'We are going to let every signed pro walk, and then collab with the worlds biggest brands that have nothing to do with pickleball,'\" Jimmy Miller, a pickleball player and host of the '\"King of the Court\" podcast, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"Bold strategy. Curious if it pays off,\" he added. \"Tesla fans will probably sell that paddle out. Who is next? Apple? Maybe they can do a Nvidia collab that comes with shares!\"",

    "description": "Adm. Alvin Holsey, the commander of US Southern Command who reportedly clashed with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the legality of the US military strikes in the Caribbean, officially retired on Friday in a ceremony in Floria where he handed the reigns of the command to his deputy.",
    "fullText": "Adm. Alvin Holsey, the commander of US Southern Command who reportedly clashed with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the legality of US military strikes in the Caribbean, officially retired on Friday in a ceremony in Florida where he handed the reins of the command to his deputy.\n\nHolsey thanked his wife, his sons — one of whom is a currently deployed Naval aviator — and others who attended the event.\n\n“I’m reminded that in life, we don’t remember days, we remember moments. Those we lead don’t follow titles, they follow courage, and they remember the moments and how you made them feel,” Holsey said. “They remember those who listen and treated them with dignity and respect.”\n\nHolsey will be replaced by Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, who has been serving as his deputy at Southern Command since Holsey was elevated to the role last year.\n\nSouthern Command is responsible for managing US military operations in most of Latin America and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nHolsey’s retirement was announced in October by Hegseth, less than a year into Holsey’s command and just days after the US conducted its fifth attack on an alleged drug trafficking boat off the coast of Venezuela. Hegseth and Holsey had disagreements over US operations in the region, two sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN.\n\nHegseth felt Holsey was not moving aggressively enough to combat drug traffickers in the Southern Command area of operations, CNN has reported, while Southern Command officials were concerned about the legality of the strikes.\n\nThose issues came to a head in an October 6 meeting at the Pentagon between Holsey, Hegseth, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine. One of the sources familiar with the situation said Holsey offered to leave his post during that meeting, CNN has reported, but the offer was tabled.\n\nThe legality of the US strikes against alleged drug boats has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks as lawmakers have demanded answers about a follow-on strike carried out in September that killed two survivors of an initial attack.\n\nCaine, who presided over Friday’s ceremony, called Holsey a “quiet professional” and “an extraordinary human who’s always led with your heart, your head, and gone all-in every single day of your service.”\n\n“You’ve made an incredible difference to our joint force. You made an incredible difference here in this headquarters. You make an incredible difference to this nation…we will always be grateful for the gift of a great example for you and your family’s service and sacrifice, and for the way that you’ve approached the professional wisdom of leadership and service,” Cain said. “The impact that you’ve had will last for a long, long time.”\n\nHolsey’s successor, Pettus, is an Air Force Academy graduate and a pilot of the F-15e and A-10 with more than 2,700 flight hours, according to his official biography. Prior to joining Southern Command, Pettus led the 12th Air Force (Air Forces Southern) stationed out of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. Air Forces Southern provides “air, space and cyberspace capabilities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean,” Pettus’ bio says.\n\nPettus has been at Southern Command working as Holsey’s deputy during the alleged drug boat strike campaign that started in September at a time that the US has also been massing personnel and assets in the region and conducting training missions off the coast of Venezuela, even reopening a military base in Puerto Rico that had been closed for decades.\n\nCNN has reported that a significant percentage of all deployed US Naval assets are now in the theater, including the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group, the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit. Those groups amount to roughly 15,000 US troops, multiple guided-missile destroyers, an attack submarine, a special operations ship, and various fighter aircraft.\n\nThe relinquishment of Holsey’s command also comes just days after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela; President Donald Trump said only that the vessel was seized for “very good reason,” in comments to reporters Wednesday. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a social media post announcing the seizure that the tanker had been sanctioned by the US for years “due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

    "title": "Doctors Say COVID Symptoms Are Changing—Here’s What to Watch for With the New Variant",
    "description": "The symptoms of COVID-19 have changed over time. Here, infectious disease doctors share what many people are experiencing with the latest variant.",
    "fullText": "The Stratus variant is fueling COVID-19 cases around the country.\n\nSymptoms of the virus look slightly different right now.\n\nHere, doctors share what to look out for and how to protect yourself from the latest variant.\n\nA newer COVID variant called XFG is currently fueling cases of the virus across the country. Nicknamed “Stratus,” this variant first took hold over the summer and now makes up nearly 70% of COVID-19 cases in the country. As the virus evolves, some signs you’re sick might too. So, what are COVID-19 symptoms in 2025?\n\nWhile some liken it to the common cold, COVID-19 is still a lethal disease, and certain groups are still at a higher risk of a more severe form of the virus. But many people are experiencing an uncomfortable illness with symptoms that are slightly different from what having COVID-19 used to feel like.\n\nInfectious disease doctors stress that every person’s experience with the virus is different. “So many infections now are milder, but there are still people being hospitalized with COVID,” says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nMeet the experts: Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York; William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine\n\nEven if you’re not in a high-risk group for serious complications from COVID-19, “you can’t count on avoiding severe illness,” says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nSo, what are the biggest COVID symptoms right now? Here’s what you should know.\n\nAgain, everyone’s experience with COVID-19 is slightly different. “It depends on a combination of how much virus you’re exposed to, what your underlying state of immunity is, and the underlying host—are you a younger, healthier host, an older host, or have underlying health conditions?” Dr. Russo says.\n\nBut doctors agree that there are a few COVID-19 symptoms that many people are experiencing:\n\nThis constellation of symptoms can make COVID-19 feel like a bad cold, if you’re lucky enough to get a mild case.\n\nBut it’s still possible to experience the other legacy symptoms of COVID-19, which may include:\n\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n\nIt’s likely due to a few factors, including the different dominant variant and built-up immunity to the virus (from vaccination and previous infection), Dr. Russo says.\n\nIt’s also just the nature of the virus, according to Dr. Schaffner. “COVID is a respiratory virus, and all of these viruses can produce similar symptoms involving the nose, throat, and chest,” he says.\n\nAgain, that doesn’t mean that this is what COVID-19 will look like for you—it’s just what many people are experiencing right now. “I’m thrilled that many people are experiencing mild symptoms, but you can’t count on that, particularly if you haven’t gotten your vaccine or boosters, and haven’t recently been infected,” Dr. Russo says. “The subsequent consequences of COVID, in terms of long COVID, is much more significant than it is for influenza.”\n\nAccording to wastewater data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 cases are currently high in these states:\n\nThere are plenty of other states with moderate levels of the virus, per CDC data.\n\nThe amount of time you’re contagious with COVID-19 can vary, but the virus tends to follow a certain pattern in terms of being able to infect others. “You’re contagious for the day before you get sick and then most contagious for the next two to three days,” Dr. Schaffner says. “It tapers off after that, but it’s not like a light switch.”\n\nIf you’ve been vaccinated, the amount of time that you’re contagious will be less than if you’re unvaccinated, Dr. Russo says. Overall, Dr. Russo says it’s safe to assume that you’re not likely to infect anyone 10 days after you first got sick. “That’s a safe rule of thumb,” he says.\n\nIf you’re planning to be around people who are vulnerable to getting seriously ill before then, like small children, older adults, and people with underlying health conditions, Dr. Russo recommends wearing a mask.\n\nNo shocker here—doctors recommend getting your updated COVID-19 vaccine, if you haven’t already. “Think about getting out your mask and think twice about those holiday gatherings, especially if you’re high-risk,” Dr. Schaffner says. And, of course, do your best to stay away from people who are obviously sick.\n\nWhile many people have stopped testing themselves for COVID-19, it’s still worth taking an at-home COVID test if you’ll be around vulnerable people—or just don’t want to spread what you’ve got to anyone.\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "fullText": "Looking ahead to the January and summer transfer windows, there look to be two main positions that Manchester City will look to strengthen. It would not be a surprise to see City move for another winger or attacking player in January. Omar Marmoush will be unavailable for an extended period of time due to the African Cup of Nations. City could benefit from signing another attacking player next month. It would also seem that Pep Guardiola’s squad would benefit from signing a right-back. That move appears to be one that will likely take place in the summer and there is one player who is emerging as City’s main target for the right-back role.\n\nTwo new reports have emerged that state that Manchester City could move for Tino Livramento next summer. The first comes from Craig Hope for the Daily Mail. Hope reports that Tino Livramento is set to delay any decision on signing a contract extension with Newcastle United until near the end of this season. Furthermore, Hope reports that Livramento’s long-term future is uncertain. Hope further reports that Manchester City have a strong interest in signing the England international. Lastly, it is also reported that if Newcastle United qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League, Tino Livramento could sign a contract extension with Newcastle. Newcastle United are determined to keep Livramento at the club as per Craig Hope’s report.\n\nJordan Campbell has reported for The Athletic that Manchester City decided not to pursue a move for Tino Livramento last summer as they deemed a move for the England international as out of reach. Furthermore, Campbell reports that Tino Livramento is highly appreciated as a player at City. Campbell also reports that City could have to pay near enough to £100 million to sign Tino Livramento from Newcastle United if he doesn’t sign a contract extension with Eddie Howe’s side.\n\nAll indications are that Manchester City have identified Tino Livramento as the primary transfer target to come in at right-back. Matheus Nunes has done a superb job playing in the position this season. Nunes’ game has improved and there is no reason why he cannot remain as Manchester City’s first-choice right-back for this season. Abdukodir Khusanov can step in for Nunes when required. It would be almost impossible for City to sign Tino Livramento in January so the England international would look to be a summer target for City.\n\nBased on Craig Hope and Jordan Campbell’s reports it seems to now be a matter of when City will make their move to sign Tino Livramento from Newcastle, not if they will make that particular move. There is now too much noise to suggest otherwise. Livramento would almost be the ideal signing for City. He is a homegrown player blessed with tremendous technical ability and he is a tremendous defender at either left or right-back. He is also the ideal age to arrive at City as an established player with his best years ahead of him. Livramento ticks every box required of a potential Manchester City signing.\n\nAs of right now, unless Livramento extends his contract with Newcastle, it seems that City will move to sign Tino Livramento. It will likely be a move that Manchester City will pursue next summer. Whether or not that move will be successful remains to be seen. But it would appear that City have identified their top target to sign for the right-back position.",

    "fullText": "Detroit Catholic Central four-star wide receiver Samson Gash is one of the few unsigned blue-chippers left in the 2026 cycle.\n\nThe 6-foot pass-catcher has been committed to Michigan State since June 24, but he decided not to sign earlier this month as the Spartans had a change at head coach and elsewhere on the staff. The in-state program still holds his commitment, but other programs are in the mix, too.\n\nAnother notable offer came through for Gash on Friday. He took to social media to announce an offer from James Coley and the Georgia Bulldogs:\n\nBlessed to receive an offer from Georgia!!\n\n@CoachColey@KirbySmartUGA@DHill39@AllenTrieu@GregSmithRivals@SWiltfong_@adamgorneypic.twitter.com/cIFyIumAHB\n\nWR (@GashSamson) December 13, 2025\n\nWith UGA in the mix, it could throw another wrinkle in the recruitment of Gash, which has taken multiple turns this fall. Before the coaching change in East Lansing, Michigan State was already trying to fend off Alabama.\n\nThe Crimson Tide were in pursuit of Gash this fall and a flip looked to be probable, but the SEC program took its foot off the gas. After the firing of Michigan State head coach Jonathan Smith, Gash began to draw interest from West Virginia.\n\nAt the end of the National Signing Period last week, it looked the Mountaineers were in the driver’s seat. Earlier this week, though, Penn State and new head coach Matt Campbell jumped in with an offer. Gash’s father, Sam Gash, played for the Nittany Lions.\n\n“This offer means a lot to me. It’s been a long time coming,” Gash told BWI. “I’ve been up there a few times and I know the program is in great hands with this new Iowa State staff that I like and trust a lot after they were recruiting me a little bit at Iowa State.”\n\nGeorgia will now look to make its presence felt for Gash, who won’t put pen to paper until February. The Bulldogs lost four-star WR Brady Marchese during the signing period as he flipped to Michigan. They did still sign a pair of four-star wideouts last week in Craig Dandridge and Ryan Mosley.\n\nMichigan State, now led by Pat Fitzgerald, still signed 19 prospects last week. It would love to keep Gash in the mix, too, but it won’t be easy.\n\n“It feels really good knowing MSU is in good hands and is a safe option for me and great hire,” Gash told Rivals’ Greg Smith about the Fitzgerald hire.\n\nGash is the No. 292 overall prospect and No. 46 WR in the 2026 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 6 recruit in Michigan.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMIAMI, Florida, Dec. 12 — The Northwestern [Miami, FL] Bulls roll into Florida's FHSAA Class 3A title Friday evening with a 23-game win streak and an undefeated 13-0 record as they look to defend their 2024 state championship at Florida International University's Pitbull Stadium.\n\nTheir opponent will look very familiar as they'll face the same Raines [Jacksonville, FL] Vikings' squad they beat, 41-0, in last year's title tilt. Raines also sports a 13-0 record headed into the contest.\n\nNorthwestern will be seeking its eight state championship in football while Raines is in the hunt for its fourth football state championship trophy.\n\nGame time is set for 7:30 p.m. EST local.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 22 Northwestern [Miami, FL] Bulls vs. Raines [Jacksonville, FL] Vikings\n\nThis Raines defense! I've been talking about them all night here, and they get an interception with a big return when Northwestern goes for it on fourth down. After trailing by nine, the Vikings are, amazingly, in business.\n\nWith 7:12 to play, Raines finally has some points from the offense, tacking on a field goal. It's important. It gets this back to a one-score game, and a touchdown and PAT could possibly win it.\n\nThis was never going to be easy for Raines, and it just got a lot harder as the Vikings' defense finally gives up its first touchdown. Northwestern back firmly in control in a two-score game now.\n\nWell, Raines has finally scored against Northwestern, but it's the only 7 points they have in seven quarters against this Northwestern team the past two years. But, the difference this year is their defense is keeping this thing close. And that defense might have to go and win this thing for them.\n\nNorthwestern shakes off the interception and drives down into position for another field goal. But these are still small victories for the Vikings. They're giving their offense every opportunity to go win this game.\n\nWell, the defense for Raines has been keeping them in this game, and now they've given the Vikings the lead on a long interception return. This is a crazy swing, and in seven quarters of play against Northwestern, this is the first points Raines has managed. But this is no anomaly; this is the Viking's 12th defensive touchdown this year.\n\nNorthwestern adds another field goal, but Raines' defense is playing tough tonight. They're giving the offense a chance if it can ever get on track.\n\nAnd the third quarter is just getting under way!\n\nThis is looking a lot better than last year, but one important number is the same so far – that goose egg on the Vikings' side of the scoreboard. They lost last year's game 41-0, and through two quarters tonight, the offense still hasn't cracked the code against this stout Bulls' defense.\n\nRaines was finally driving deep in Northwestern's territory, helped along by a pass interference penalty. But then they throw an interception near the 5 yard line with 39 seconds to play in the first half.\n\nKhavon Gipson with a clutch interception for Northwestern. Raines was driving. pic.twitter.com/WKTZkhHnnN\n\n— Adam Lichtenstein (@ABLichtenstein) December 13, 2025\n\nNorthwestern was about to score when the running back took a hard lick near the goal line. The ball rolled into the end zone where Raines recovered to take over. The Vikings' defense is bending but not breaking. But they need some help from the offense late in the second quarter.\n\nRaines was pinned deep in its own territory after the turnover on downs. They were forced to punt from their end zone, but Northwestern mishandles the punt, and Raines pounces on it. Northwestern would have had great field position around the Vikings' 30, but instead, the Vikings keep their drive alive.\n\nNorthwestern takes their second drive inside the Raines' 5. On fourth and goal, they go for the first down, but the Vikings' defense forces the turnover on downs!\n\nNorthwestern puts together a solid drive, but Raines' defense stands tall in the shadow of their own end zone to force a field goal.\n\nField goal! @mnw_fb scores first.

But Clayton is in this, and they've proven so far that they can make plays on both sides of the field.\n\nWith just 37 second to play in the first half, Grimsley finally takes its first lead of the night. Faizon Brandon making plays with his feet tonight, too.\n\nWell, it's been tough going for the defending state champions from Grimsley, but they finally get on the board as Faizon Brandon finds Hudson Cooper with a strike in the middle of the field near the goal line. Cooper falls into the end zone on the tackle, and they're back to even in Chapel Hill.\n\nSo far, the defending champs are having a tough go of it. They haven't been able to make plays against this Clayton defense, yet. A long way to go, but you have to be happy with that first 12 minutes if you're a Comets' fan.\n\nClayton jumps on the defending champs early.\n\nThey're under way in Chapel Hill, North Carolina!\n\nThe game between Clayton and Grimsley is being played at the University of North Carolina's Kenan Stadium.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 20/SN No. 17 Grimsley [Greensboro, NC] Whirlies vs. Clayton [NC] Comets\n\nMORE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF HEADLINES\n\nFlorida 2025 playoff brackets (7A/6A/5A/4A)\n\nGeorgia 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nLouisiana 2025 playoff brackets (Division I/II)\n\nTexas 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Midwest Athletic Conference produces some of the best small-school athletes at the high school level anywhere in Ohio.\n\nAs far as boys basketball goes, Cameron Elwer of Delphos St. John's now stands alone.\n\nOn Friday night, Elwer became the MAC's all-time leading scorer.\n\nHere's a look at the shot that did it:\n\n#ThatMomentWhen@elwer_cameron became the @midwestathletic all time leading scorer. pic.twitter.com/Jui7T1PC42\n\n— Michael Hirn (@MichaelHirnPBP) December 13, 2025\n\nElwer broke the record previously held by Versailles' Justin Ahrens, which had stood at 2,046 points.\n\nHe needed 30 on the night to break the mark. Elwer dropped 45.\n\nThe Blue Jays' senior star drilled 11 3-pointers in the process, a special night all around, as St. John's beat MAC rival Minster, 64-44.\n\nElwer entered this season with major expectations, playing on a roster filled with his brothers and cousins, a whole host of Elwers.\n\nThe leading Elwer is bound for Division I Furman after this season. First, he'll put together one final magical season showing the entire MAC what he can do, and hopefully, make a run that shows the rest of the state, too.\n\nElwer will have plenty of time to expand on his record, and he surely will along a path that includes a lot of winning, too.\n\nMORE: Cooper Flagg makes NBA history only done by LeBron, 'Melo and Wemby",

    "title": "Papermoon: A Space-Grade Linux for the NewSpace Era",
    "description": "Discover Papermoon, the open source project creating a standard, space-grade Linux to replace bespoke software for satellites and spacecraft in the NewSpace era.",
    "fullText": "TOKYO — When I worked for NASA in the 1980s, every satellite and spaceship that went into orbit ran one-off, hand-coded, semi-proprietary programs. This approach was painful, expensive, and sometimes disastrous, as with the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999 due to a software blunder.\n\nThings have changed. In his “Space Grade Linux” keynote at the Open Source Summit Japan conference, Ramón Roche, a longtime robotics developer and general manager of the Dronecode Foundation, told how Linux and open source software are becoming the default for every launch — replacing the bespoke, one-off programs of the past.\n\nThis change has been coming for a while. By 2013, the International Space Station (ISS) switched out its Windows laptops for Debian Linux machines for mission-critical work. Today, SpaceX’s workhorse rocket, Falcon 9, and its Dragon spacecraft both run Linux. Roche also noted that the first aircraft on another planet, the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars, flew with Linux. Heck, a developer recently managed to run open source Doomon, a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite.\n\nBut Roche stressed that one thing has been lacking. A common space Linux platform so that space companies can stop “competing on the plumbing” and start sharing core software infrastructure.\n\nThe economic backdrop is a classic space‑tech storyline: It’s cheaper than ever to access orbit, but software complexity and safety requirements keep rising.\n\n“You can launch a satellite for the cost of a nice car,” Roche said, noting that the cost per kilogram is “quickly approaching less than $100 per kilo to ship payload to space,” which in turn fuels a flywheel of more launches, more applications and even “data centers in space.”\n\nWhat doesn’t scale, he argued, is the way many missions are still engineered as bespoke, one‑off software stacks. “It’s 2025 right now, and we’re still in a phase like 1969,” where missions are one‑off and expensive. That model “was fine back when launches cost millions of dollars, he noted, “but no longer fits the economics of NewSpace.\n\nSpace’s harsh realities — radiation‑induced “single set events” that reboot systems without warning, communication delays “measured in minutes,” and the impossibility of “SSH there” to fix a broken satellite — are pushing developers toward robust, well-understood, community‑maintained open source instead of proprietary stacks.\n\nThe problem, as Roche sees it, is not whether Linux is the right base layer for autonomous systems, but how it is used.\n\nA survey of practitioners identified Yocto as the “clear winner” among embedded Linux distributions. However, we still have a fragmented landscape of teams “building their own version of Linux from scratch” with “no shared foundational layer,” Roche said.\n\n“Everyone agrees that Linux is the answer,” he said. “But nobody agrees on which Linux.”\n\nThat fragmentation looks familiar to Roche, who has spent more than a decade in the drone ecosystem around PX4 and related projects.\n\n“I was there in 2010 when the drone industry looked very similar. Everyone was building on their own stacks, nobody talking to anyone else,” he recalled, describing “years of complicated effort” and “every company reinventing the wheel, incompatible protocols” before the community decided to “stop competing on the plumbing and start competing on innovation.”\n\nIn his telling, that shift enabled open source to power “the majority of commercial and professional drones worldwide,” from agriculture and inspection to mapping, search‑and‑rescue, and even defense.\n\nThe answer is Papermoon, a proposed space‑grade Linux stack. Roche described it as “an open source project and a new foundation” built around Linux as the “autoplay, middle layer architecture,” licensed under MIT, with a Developer Certificate of Origin rather than contribution agreements “friction.”\n\nOn the hardware side, early targets include RISC‑V development boards “like a Raspberry Pi, same price point,” Roche said, alongside space‑designed platforms such as Microchip’s radiation‑tolerant MPSoC, with continuous integration already running “on every commit” and images booting on actual boards.\n\n“This is what you’re getting,” Roche told the audience, arguing that teams who adopt Papermoon are “not starting from zero”— the base layer, build system, and “safety‑aware configuration” represent “months that you don’t need to spend reinventing if you collaborate with us.”\n\nTo tackle safety and certification head-on, the project has been incubating inside the Linux Foundation’s Enabling Linux in Safety Applications (ELISA) initiative.  Roche highlighted ELISA vice president Kate Stewart’s work as emblematic of the community Papermoon wants to align with.\n\n“If you’re building safety‑critical systems that run on Linux, there’s no one better to learn from,” he said. “ELISA has been working on this problem since 2019: How do you use Linux in systems where failure means loss of life?”\n\nA year ago, about 30 people met in person at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) — my home base when I worked for NASA — with another 40 joining virtually from more than 20 organizations, agencies, and research groups, to “decide the direction for this project,” which Roche framed as “not a maintenance‑only conversation, that’s actual, real commitment.”\n\nThe next move, he said, is to “step out of the ELISA incubation and form our own foundation with neutral overheads, member‑driven, the same models that work for automotive grade Linux,” where founding members “help us shape what this becomes: the governance, the roadmap, and standards that we set.”\n\nRoche’s pitch to developers and companies in the room was blunt: Ingenuity “proved Linux belongs in space,” but “the next mission shouldn’t start from scratch.”\n\n“The question is, does every team after this rebuild from zero, or do we give them that foundation?” he asked, positioning Papermoon as that shared base and urging those “building for space” who recognize the pattern from drones and automotive to “come talk to us” and “help us build the foundation for the next era of space.”",

    "description": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Friday released never-before-seen images from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein",
    "fullText": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Friday released never-before-seen images from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some featuring powerbrokers like Bill Gates and Larry Summers.\n\nThe photos — which also feature President Donald Trump, ex-Trump advisor Steve Bannon, former President Bill Clinton, writer-director Woody Allen, Richard Branson, and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew — are a selection of the over 95,000 photos that the Democrats say were provided to the House Oversight Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nSome of the photos also include Ghislaine Maxwell, a onetime partner of Epstein who was convicted of trafficking girls to him for sex. She's currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nThe committee previously released other records obtained from Epstein's estate, including images of his US Virgin Islands home and tens of thousands of emails and text messages between Epstein and other powerful people.\n\nThe images themselves aren't indications of wrongdoing.\n\nIn many cases, it isn't clear when the photos were taken. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and agreed to register as a pedophile. In 2019, he killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on more severe sex-trafficking charges from federal prosecutors.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee's ranking member, Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, said in a statement: \"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Gates, Summers, Bannon, Clinton, Allen, Branson, and Mountbatten-Windsor did not immediately respond to requests for comment by Business Insider.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Business Insider in a statement that House Democrats are once again \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"\n\nThe latest release of images comes as the Department of Justice readies to release a trove of Epstein-related documents. The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump, requires the Justice Department to make its files related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell public by December 19.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends,\" Jackson said.\n\nBelow are some of the 19 images that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published on Friday:",

    "fullText": "It's not just grocery prices that are high — it's also the shopping baskets, or at least some of them.\n\nA Chanel handbag cosplaying as a grocery basket sold for $152,400 at auction on Thursday, breaking brand records.\n\nThe piece — the rare, runway silver and black lambskin leather shopping basket bag from 2014 — sold for more than 10 times its low estimate of $15,000 at the online auction from Christie's.\n\nThat's a lot of money, but far from the most expensive handbag ever sold.\n\nIn July, Hermès' original Birkin bag — worn by Jane Birkin, herself — sold for $10.1 million, becoming the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic purse went to a private collector in Japan, who phoned in and won a 10-minute bidding war.\n\nWhile items selling for millions, or even six figures, may be rare, the luxury resale market is booming.\n\nThe secondhand fashion and luxury market is expected to reach $317 billion by 2027, according to a McKinsey report published last month, and it's growing three times as fast as the firsthand market. Secondhand luxury retailers like The RealReal and Fashionphile have recorded double-digit revenue growth this year.\n\nMost luxury resale shoppers are turning to the market to find more affordable options, particularly as handbags from some of the biggest names have experienced significant price hikes over the past few years.\n\nChanel is one of the worst offenders. The price of its iconic flap bag nearly doubled between 2019 and 2024. This year, the brand increased prices again, hiking those of about 21% of its products by 5% in February, according to research from Citi. Add Trump's tariffs to the mix, and luxury handbags are more expensive than ever.\n\nThat said, it's not all deals on the secondhand market. Some savvy shoppers are treating luxury resale as an investment opportunity. Bags from Chanel sold for as much as 30% over their retail value on The RealReal last year.\n\nClassic handbags from brands like Louis Vuitton and Hermès tend to hold their value for years. Some of the most coveted handbags even sell for more on the secondhand market.",

    "description": "Almost a month after Prime Video launched AI-powered Video Recaps, viewers said it shared incorrect plot details about season one of \"Fallout.\"",
    "fullText": "Given the length of time it can take for the new season of your favorite TV show to come out, it's understandable that you might want a little video recap of what's happened so far.\n\nIdeally, that recap is accurate.\n\nFans of Amazon's hit show \"Fallout\" said that wasn't the case in its AI-made synopsis of season one, released ahead of the hit show's new season next week. Fans quickly spotted factual errors, and Amazon Prime Video took down the recap.\n\nOne Redditor said the AI feature told viewers that a flashback featuring the Ghoul (one of the main characters, played by Walton Goggins) took place in the 1950s instead of 2077.\n\nAn X user posted that the recap also mischaracterized the agreement the Ghoul and Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell) made in the \"Fallout\" finale.\n\nInstead of saying the pair is teaming up to find Lucy's father, the recap said the Ghoul gave Lucy an ultimatum: \"die or join him.\"\n\nAmazon first launched its Video Recap, a feature that allows users to catch up on Prime Original TV shows between seasons, for beta testing in November.\n\n\"Video Recaps use AI to identify a show's most important plot points, combining them with synchronized voice narration, dialogue snippets, and music to create a visual summary that prepares viewers for the new season,\" the company said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe TV shows that Amazon said were undergoing Video Recaps testing — \"Jack Ryan,\" \"Upload,\" \"Bosch,\" and \"The Rig\" — did not include the feature at the time of writing.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLike so many companies, Amazon is investing heavily in AI.\n\nDuring the company's February earnings call, Chief Finance Officer Brian Olsavsky said that 2025 capital expenditures could reach over $100 billion, with the majority of it going toward AI and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing platform.\n\nMany of Amazon's consumer services have integrated AI to enhance user engagement and experience, such as product suggestions and helping shoppers on its online platform find clothes that fit. In February, Amazon unveiled Alexa+, the next generation of Alexa, which is powered by generative AI to make it more conversational and personalized for users.\n\nEmbracing AI at Amazon, though, hasn't been without growing pains. In October, the company cited AI as it announced it would lay off 14,000 staff members.\n\n\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post at the time.\n\nIn an internal message to the remaining staff, Amazon Vice President of Device Software and Services Tapas Roy asked them to \"lean in on AI.\"\n\n\"Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products,\" Roy wrote. \"In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes.\"",

    "description": "Disney staffers spoke about the company's OpenAI deal and AI strategy, including AI tools they are using and one in development codenamed \"Jarvis.\"",
    "fullText": "Disney's billion-dollar OpenAI deal isn't the only way the company is embracing AI. In recent months, the Mouse House has been quietly adding new AI tools to its arsenal and encouraging staff to use them.\n\n\"They clearly see where things are headed,\" a longtime software engineer at Disney said. This marked a shift from this summer, when Disney had seemed \"hesitant to rely on AI tools,\" they said.\n\nDisney has given its employees access to several AI tools, including Microsoft Copilot and Amazon's Q Developer. Thanks to Disney's OpenAI deal, employees will also soon have access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT, the company said.\n\nThen there's a \"DisneyGPT\" chatbot that four staffers said helps with internal requests, such as creating IT support tickets, viewing the company roster, or analyzing a project's financials.\n\nIn an email sent to staff on October 2, Disney introduced the beta version of the chatbot, describing it as a \"new partner in productivity\" designed to help \"unlock the magic of your imagination.\" A December update enabled employees to upload Excel and PowerPoint files to the bot.\n\nDisneyGPT draws on signature Disney themes, with a prompt asking users if they're \"ready for an enchanting adventure\" and \"a verified collection of Walt Disney quotes\" that are \"tagged by themes like imagination, perseverance, and leadership,\" according to the chatbot's December update log. Otherwise, employees said DisneyGPT is mostly a standard AI chatbot.\n\nThere's also an AI chatbot in the works codenamed \"Jarvis,\" four employees said. Jarvis, named for the personal assistant \"J.A.R.V.I.S.\" from \"Iron Man,\" would be an agentic AI tool — more advanced than DisneyGPT — that completes tasks on an employee's behalf, a high-level staffer with direct knowledge of the company's AI efforts said. This person said Jarvis is in its early stages and is \"not fully baked.\"\n\n\"It's definitely something they want to push for everyone to lean into more,\" a Disney manager said of AI.\n\nCompanies in every industry are racing to adopt AI tools to boost productivity. Disney is going further than many, however. The OpenAI deal makes Disney the first major entertainment company to invest in the AI juggernaut, and allows its beloved characters to be used in the video generator Sora.\n\nThis reflects Disney's long tradition of merging innovation and entertainment, dating back to its founder, Walt.\n\nThree of the eight Disney employees who spoke with Business Insider expressed concerns about using AI, specifically that it could replace humans and threaten job security.\n\nThe high-level employee with direct knowledge of Disney's AI strategy said that while AI is a \"top priority,\" it isn't a cure-all. It can make mistakes and lacks a \"personalized touch\" that people provide, they said.\n\n\"If you use AI everywhere, it's going to be counterproductive,\" this person said, adding that tasks still need human creativity.\n\nDisney spokespeople didn't respond to several requests for comment on its internal AI efforts.\n\nOn an internal Disney website explaining its AI policy and tools, the company said it employs a \"responsible and human-centric approach to using AI.\"\n\n\"That means humans are, and will remain, the creative engine of the company,\" Disney said on the site. \"We believe, fundamentally, that human creativity and curiosity are immense and unique — and are at the heart of Disney.\"\n\n\"Simultaneously, our consistent embrace of new technologies has been a key part of empowering our creators and maintaining our leadership in creativity and innovation,\" the company continued in its \"Responsible AI Use\" section.\n\nSeven of the eight Disney staffers Business Insider interviewed have tried or regularly use DisneyGPT or Copilot, which is integrated into employees' email accounts and documents. Many use those AI tools for simple, routine tasks, like writing emails.\n\nDisney has a portal on its website that outlines its AI policy and lists Disney-approved AI tools. Two employees said the company has pointed staffers to AI education or compliance training courses.\n\nSome unsanctioned AI tools like Anthropic's Claude can be more effective than Disney-approved AI tools, three staffers said.\n\nOne employee at Disney-owned ESPN said their manager told them they could use personal accounts on non-approved AI chatbots for work.\n\n\"I'm just using a personal account because Disney isn't allowing us to use these tools yet,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nThe staffer with direct knowledge of Disney's AI efforts said leadership had tried to make communications about AI \"clear across the board,\" but acknowledged that workers might not \"understand the implications\" of data security risks that could arise from using unsanctioned AI tools. Some staffers told Business Insider it was hard for them to keep up with the availability and restrictions on various AI tools.\n\nWhile some Disney employees expressed mixed feelings about AI, the more bullish among them said Disney was wise to strike a deal with OpenAI.\n\n\"This type of a partnership at least establishes the precedent for getting paid,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nA Disney ads employee said they believed Disney's deal with OpenAI would \"pay off\" and \"be massive\" in five to 10 years, even if there are growing pains.\n\n\"Disney is smart to push into this,\" this staffer said. \"They are setting the rules of the game, or at least trying.\"",

    "description": "In the new Eras Tour docuseries, Taylor Swift distributes bonuses and handwritten letters to her dancers, musicians, and crew members.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift may be the biggest name in show business, but she's never one to miss a chance to thank the people who helped her succeed.\n\nSwift's new Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" features behind-the-scenes footage from the Eras Tour, which spanned 149 concerts in 21 countries. By the final show in December 2024, it had become the first tour in history to gross over $2 billion.\n\nIn the second episode of the docuseries, \"Magic in the Eras,\" Swift opens up about distributing bonuses to her dancers, musicians, and crew members as each leg of the tour comes to a close.\n\n\"Bonus day is so important because setting a precedent with the Eras Tour is really important to me. Because people who work on the road, if the tour grosses more, they get more of a bonus,\" Swift tells the camera. \"And these people just work so hard, and they are the best at what they do.\"\n\nSwift also says she hand-wrote notes to deliver with each bonus, all part of her effort to make the tour's grueling two-year schedule \"worthwhile.\"\n\n\"It took me a couple weeks, but it's fun to write them notes. It's fun to think about everybody's lives that they're going to go back to, and the time off they're going to have, and the kids they haven't seen because they've been away for months,\" Swift says. \"It feels like Christmas morning when you finally get to say thank you.\"\n\nThe next scene shows Swift personally handing out bonuses to her dancers, who'd recently been tasked with overhauling the three-and-a-half-hour show — reordering the set list and learning new choreography — to perform additional songs from \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" Swift's 11th album, which was released between the tour's stops in Singapore and France.\n\n\"This leg of this tour has been harder than anything I've ever done in a live setting. And you guys have taken this on with such excitement and such curiosity,\" Swift tells her dancers. \"The endurance you've shown, but the spirit you've shown, how much you've given to these crowds — that gives to me every single night. The tour has done really well, thanks to all of our hard work.\"\n\nOne of Swift's dancers, Kameron Saunders, reads the bonus amount out loud to the group. Although the number itself is censored in the footage, the dancers react with visible shock.\n\nPeople previously reported that Swift gave $197 million in bonuses to the crew of the Eras Tour, including caterers, lighting technicians, audio technicians, riggers, carpenters, choreographers, and more. A shot of envelopes in the docuseries reveals a stack labeled \"wardrobe/makeup/hair,\" and another labeled \"venue security.\"\n\nMichael Scherkenbach, founder and CEO of the Colorado-based trucking company Shomotion — one of two transportation companies used by the tour — has also said that each trucker received a $100,000 check and handwritten letter from Swift. He described the amount of money as \"life-changing.\"\n\n\"The typical amount is $5,000 to $10,000 each,\" Scherkenbach told CNN. \"So this large amount is unbelievable.\"\n\nThe success of the Eras Tour propelled Swift's net worth into the billions, according to Forbes. The publication's estimates are largely based on the value of Swift's musical catalog.\n\nEarlier this year, Swift bought the rights to her back catalog in a reported $360 million sale.\n\n\"That's how I spent that Eras Tour money,\" Swift told Stephen Colbert. \"My fans are why I was able to get my music back.\"",

    "fullText": "US Air Force pilots have a new training aircraft, the T-7 Red Hawk, promising to prepare them to fly fifth-generation fighters, stealth bombers, and the US' planned sixth-generation fighter.\n\nThe first T-7 Red Hawk trainer, made by Boeing, arrived at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas this month. The new training aircraft will replace Northrop Grumman's T-38 Talon, which pilots have been training on for six decades. The Air Force no longer deems the trainer sufficient for preparing the service's pilots for future warfare. That's why replacing the outdated Talon has been on the Air Force's to-do list for years.\n\n\"The T-38 has been life-extended multiple times,\" said Brig. Gen. Matthew Leard, director of plans, program, requirements, and international Affairs for Air Education and Training Command, in a statement. \"There's an escalating cost of retaining the airplane and keeping it flyable,\" he said, adding that the plane \"is no longer aligned with current or future aircraft.\"\n\nIn 2023, the Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, reported the Air Force was relying on the aging T-38 as a new flight simulator was delayed by a decade and new training aircraft were being developed. The aircraft, the GAO said, \"is increasingly expensive to maintain and is no longer reflective of modern combat aircraft.\"\n\nThe Air Force sees the transition to the new T-7 Red Hawk as a fundamental shift in how pilots are trained for high-stress, modern air combat.\n\n\"From day one, students won't just be learning to fly,\" Maj. Gen. Gregory Kreuder, the 19th Air Force commander, said in a statement. They'll be learning to manage information, interpret data from advanced sensors, and make critical decisions in a complex environment, all from within the trainer.\"\n\n\"This aircraft,\" he said, \"enables us to close the gap between basic pilot training and the realities of fifth generation plus warfare, producing more capable, intuitive warfighters right out of the gate.\"\n\nThe new T-7 Red Hawk will teach pilots how to fly some of the most advanced aircraft the US has, like the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II stealth aircraft.\n\nAnd under the hood of the sleek, red-tailed trainer is a flexible open design that can be updated with new features as they arrive. The trainer will also prepare pilots to fly aircraft still in development and testing, such as the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber and the upcoming sixth-gen F-47, which is being built by Boeing.\n\nAlong with the T-7 Red Hawk, new ground and maintenance training systems will help pilots build skills and keep aircraft mission-ready. A live-virtual-constructive setup — which links real flights and simulators into the same scenarios — will let the Air Force update training with new threats, platforms, and weapons without needing a new aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force still has several steps to take before the T-7 Red Hawk becomes operational.\n\nThe jet is still in development, and both pilots and maintenance personnel will need training on the systems. Instructor pilots will fly it first, with students following after. The T-7 is expected to reach initial operational capability in August 2027, with 14 aircraft expected at the 99th Flying Training Squadron at Randolph Air Force Base later that year. Until then, pilots will train on the T-6 Texan II.\n\nOther Air Force bases, like Columbus in Mississippi, Laughlin in Texas, Vance in Oklahoma, and Sheppard in Texas, will get more T-7 Red Hawks in the following years.\n\n\"The aircraft delivery is the first physical representation of progress within the program,\" Leard said.",

This week, Google DeepMind introduced the FACTS Benchmark Suite, which measures how reliably AI models produce factually accurate answers.\n\nIt tests models in four areas: answering factoid questions from internal knowledge, using web search effectively, grounding responses in long documents, and interpreting images. The best model, Google's Gemini 3 Pro, reached 69% accuracy, with other leading models falling well below that.\n\nFor context, if any of the reporters I manage filed stories that were 69% accurate, I would fire them.\n\nBeyond journalism, this number should matter to businesses betting on AI.

    "description": "Lisp in Life is a Lisp interpreter implemented in Conway’s Game of Life.",
    "fullText": "Lisp in Life is a Lisp interpreter implemented in Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nThe entire pattern is viewable on the browser here.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a high-level programming language was interpreted in Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nLisp is a language with a simple and elegant design, having an extensive ability to express sophisticated ideas as simple programs. Notably, the powerful feature of macros could be used to modify the language’s syntax to write programs in a highly flexible way. For example, macros can be used to introduce new programming paradigms to the language, as demonstrated in object-oriented-like.lisp (which can actually be evaluated by the interpreter, although complex programs take quite a long time to finish running), where a structure and syntax similar to classes in Object Oriented Programming is constructed. Despite the expressibility of Lisp, it is the world’s second oldest high-level programming language introduced in 1958, only to be preceded by Fortran.\n\nConway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton proposed in 1970. Despite it having a very simple set of rules, it is known to be Turing Complete. Lisp in Life demonstrates this fact in a rather straightforward way.\n\nHow can simple systems allow human thoughts to be articulated and be expanded? With the expressibility of Lisp and the basis of Conway’s Game of Life, Lisp in Life provides an answer to this question.\n\nThe Lisp program is provided by editing certain cells within the pattern to represent the ASCII-encoding of the Lisp program. The pattern directly reads this text and evaluates the results. You can also load your own Lisp program into the pattern and run it.\nThe standard output is written at the bottom end of the RAM module, which can be easily located and directly examined in a Game of Life viewer.\nThe Lisp implementation supports lexical closures and macros, allowing one to write Lisp programs in a Lisp-like taste, as far as the memory limit allows you to.\n\nThe Lisp interpreter is written in C. Using the build system for this project, you can also compile your own C11-compatible C code and run in on Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nAs previously mentioned,\nto the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a high-level programming language was interpreted in Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nThe entry featuring Universal Computers in LifeWiki has a list of computers created in the Game of Life.\nTwo important instances not mentioned in this entry are the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project\ncreated by the authors of the QFT project, and APGsembly created by Adam P. Goucher.\nAll of these work are designed to run an assembly language and are not designed to interpret a high-level language per se.\n\nAn example of a compiled high-level language targeted for the Game of Life is Cogol by the QFT project.\nCogol is compiled to the assembly language QFTASM, targeted for the QFT architecture.\nAlthough Cogol is targeted for the QFT architecture, it requires compilation to QFTASM for the code to be run in the QFT architecture.\n\nIn Lisp in Life, a modified version of the QFT architecture is first created for improving the pattern’s runtime.\nModifications include introducing a new cascaded storage architecture for the ROM, new opcodes, extending the ROM and RAM address space, etc.\nThe Lisp source code is then written into the computer’s RAM module as its raw binary ASCII format.\nThe Conway’s Game of Life pattern directly reads, parses, and evaluates this Lisp source code to produce its output.\nThis feature of allowing a Conway’s Game of Life pattern to evaluate a high-level programming language expressed as a string of text\nis a novel feature that was newly achieved in this project.\n\nHere is a YouTube video showing Lisp in Life in action:\n\nAn overview of the entire architecture.\n\nAn overview of the CPU and its surrounding modules. On the top are the ROM modules, with the lookup module on the right, and the value modules on the left. On the bottom left is the CPU. On the bottom right is the RAM module.\n\nThis pattern is the VarLife version of the architecture. VarLife is an 8-state cellular automaton defined in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project, which is used as an intermediate layer to create the final Conway’s Game of Life pattern. The colors of the cells indicate the 8 distinct states of the VarLife rule.\n\nThe architecture is based on Tetris8.mc in the original QFT repository. Various modifications were made to make the pattern compact, such as introducing a new lookup table architecture for the ROM, removing and adding new opcodes, expanding the ROM and RAM address space, etc.\n\nThe Conway’s Game of Life version of the architecture, converted from the VarLife pattern.\nWhat appears to be a single cell in this image is actually an OTCA metapixel zoomed away to be shown 2048 times smaller.\n\nA close-up view of a part of the ROM module in the Conway’s Game of Life version.\nEach pixel in the previous image is actually this square-shaped structure shown in this image.\nThese structures are OTCA metapixels, which can be seen to be in the On and Off meta-states in this image.\nThe OTCA Metapixel is a special Conway’s Game of Life pattern that can emulate cellular automatons with customized rules.\nThe original VarLife pattern is simulated this way so that it can run in Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nThe OTCA Metapixel simulating Life in Life can be seen in this wonderful video by Phillip Bradbury: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8\n\nA video of the RAM module in the VarLife rule in action.\n\nThe computer showing the results of the following Lisp program:\n\nThe result is 42, shown in binary ascii format (0b110100, 0b110010), read in bottom-to-up order.\n\nAs shown in this image, the standard output of the Lisp program gets written at the bottom end of the RAM module, and can be directly viewed in a Game of Life viewer.\nThis repository also contains scripts that run on Golly to decode and view the contents of the output as strings.\n\nThe Lisp interpreter, written in C, is compiled to an assembly language for a CPU architecture implemented in the Game of Life, which is a modification of the computer used in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project. The compilation is done using an extended version of ELVM (the Esoteric Language Virtual Machine). The Game of Life backend for ELVM was implemented by myself.\n\nGenerating a small enough pattern that runs in a reasonable amount of time required a lot of effort.\nThis required optimizations and improvements in every layer of the project; a brief summary would be:\n\nA more detailed description of the optimizations done in this project is available in the Implementation Details section.\n\nVarLife is an 8-state cellular automaton defined in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project.\nIt is used as an intermediate layer to generate the final Conway’s Game of Life pattern; the computer is first created in VarLife, and then converted to a Game of Life pattern.\n\nWhen converting VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life, each VarLife cell is mapped to an OTCA Metapixel (OTCAMP). The conversion from VarLife to the Game of Life is done in a way so that the behavior of the states of the VarLife pattern matches exactly with the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels in the converted Game of Life pattern.\nTherefore, it is enough to verify the behavior of the VarLife pattern to verify the behavior of the Game of Life pattern.\n\nDue to the use of OTCA Metapixels, each VarLife cell becomes extended to a 2048x2048 Game of Life cell, and 1 VarLife generation requires 35328 Game of Life generations. Therefore, the VarLife patterns run significantly faster than the Game of Life (GoL) version.\n\nAdditional details on VarLife are available in the Miscellaneous section.\n\nPattern files preloaded with various Lisp programs are available here.\nDetailed statistics such as the running time and the memory consumption are available in the Running Times and Statistics section.\n\nThe patterns can be simulated on the Game of Life simulator Golly.\n\nThe VarLife patterns can be simulated on Golly as well.\nTo run the VarLife patterns, open Golly and see File -> Preferences -> Control, and Check the “Your Rules” directory.\nOpen the directory, and copy https://github.com/woodrush/QFT-devkit/blob/main/QFT-devkit/Varlife.rule to the directory.\n\nobject-oriented-like.lisp:\n This example creates a structure similar to classes in Object-Oriented Programming, using closures.\n\nThe Lisp interpreter’s variable scope and the macro feature is powerful enough to manage complex memory management,\n and even providing a new syntax to support the target paradigm.\n\nprintquote.lisp: A simple demonstration of macros.\n\nfactorial.lisp: A simple demonstration of recursion with the factorial function.\n\nz-combinator.lisp:\nDemonstration of the Z Combinator to implement a factorial function\nusing anonymous recursion.\n\nbackquote-splice.lisp:\nImplements the backquote macro used commonly in Lisp to construct macros.\nIt also supports the unquote and unquote-splice operations, each written as ~ and ~@.\n\nprimes.lisp: Prints a list of prime numbers up to 20. This example highlights the use of the while syntax.\n\nThe contents of print.lisp is quite straightforward - it calculates and prints the result of 3 * 14.\nbackquote.lisp and primes-print.lisp are similar to backquote-splice.lisp and primes.lisp, mainly included for performance comparisons.\nbackquote.lisp doesn’t implement the unquote-splice operation, and demonstrates some more examples.\nprimes-print.lisp reduces the number of list operations to save memory usage.\n\nThis Lisp interpreter supports lexical closures.\nThe implementation of lexical closures is powerful enough to write an object-oriented-like code as shown in object-oriented-like.lisp,\nwhere classes are represented as lexical closures over the field variables and the class methods.\n\nThis Lisp interpreter supports macros. Lisp macros can be thought as a function that receives code and returns code.\nFollowing this design, macros are treated exacly the same as lambdas, except that it takes the arguments as raw S-expressions,\nand evaluates the result twice (the first time to build the expression, and the second time to actually evaluate the builded expression).\n\nConway’s Game of Life (GoL) Patterns\n\nThe running times for each program are shown above. The Hashlife algorithm used for the simulation requires a lot of memory in exchange of speedups.\nThe simulations were run on a 32GB-RAM computer, with Golly’s memory usage limit set to 28000 MB, and the default base step to 2 (configurable from the preferences).\nThe memory usage was measured by Ubuntu’s activity monitor. “(max.)” shows where the maximum permitted memory was used.\nThe number of CPU cycles and the QFT memory usage was obtained by running the QFTASM interpreter on the host PC.\nThe QFT memory usage shows the number of RAM addresses that were written at least once.\nThe memory usage is measured in words, which is 16 bits in this architecture.\n\nAll of the VarLife patterns can actually be run on a computer. The shortest running time is about 1 minute for print.lisp.\nA sophisticated program such as object-oriented-like.lisp can even run in about 22 minutes.\n\nOn the other hand, the Game of Life patterns take significantly more time than the VarLife patterns, but for short programs it can be run in a moderately reasonable amount of time.\nFor example, print.lisp finishes running in about 6 hours in the Game of Life pattern.\nAs mentioned in the “Conversion from VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life” section, since the Game of Life pattern emulates the behavior of the VarLife pattern using OTCA Metapixels,\nthe behavior of the Game of Life patterns can be verified by running the VarLife patterns.\n\nThere are tests to check the behavior of the Lisp interpreter.\nThere is a test for checking the QFTASM-compiled Lisp interpreter using the QFTASM interpreter, and a test for checking the GCC-compiled Lisp interpreter on the host pc.\nTo run these tests, use the following commands:\n\nRunning make test requires Hy, a Clojure-like Lisp implemented in Python available via pip install hy.\nSome of the tests compare the output results of Hy and the output of the QFTASM Lisp interpreter.\n\nThe tests were run on Ubuntu and Mac.\n\nThis section explains how to load the Lisp interpreter (written in C) to the Game of Life pattern, and also how to load a custom Lisp program into the pattern to run it on Game of Life.\n\nPlease see build.md from the GitHub repository.\n\nThis section describes the implementation details for the various optimizations for the QFT assembly and the resulting Game of Life pattern.\n\nThe optimized string lookup process is as follows.\nFirst, when the Lisp parser accepts a symbol token, it creates a 4-bit hash of the string with the checksum of the ASCII representation of the string. The hash points to a hashtable that holds the root of a binary search tree for string comparison. Each node in the tree holds the string of the symbol token, and two nodes that are before and after the token in alphabetical order. When a query symbol token arrives in the parsing phase, a node with a matching token is returned, or a new node for the token is added into this binary tree if the token does not exist yet. This allows for each distinct symbol in the S-expression to have a distinct memory address.\n\nIn the interpretation phase, since each distinct symbol has a distinct memory address, and every string required for the Lisp program has already been parsed, string comparison can be done by simply comparing the memory address of the tokens. Since the interpreter only uses string equality operations for string comparison, simply checking for integer equality suffices for string comparison, speeding up the interpretation phase. Since the hash key is 4 bits long, this allows for reducing 4 searches in the binary tree compared to using a single binary tree.\n\nThere are 17 distinct procedures for evaluating the special forms in the Lisp interpreter,\ndefine, if, quote, car, cdr, cons, atom, print, progn, while, {lambda, macro}, eval, eq, {+, -, *, /, mod}, {<, >}, list, and lambda/macro invocations (when if the token is not a special form). Using an if statement to find the corresponding procedure for a given token becomes a linear search for the token comparisons. To speed up this search process, a hash table is created for jumping to the corresponding procedures. Since the memory addresses for the special forms can be determined before parsing the Lisp program, all of the symbols for the special forms have a fixed memory address. Therefore, the hash key can be created by subtracting an offset to the symbol’s memory address, to point to a hashtable that is created near the register locations. This hashtable is provided in memheader.eir. When the hash key is larger than the regions of this hashtable, it means that the symbol is not a special form, so the evaluation jumps to the lambda/macro invocation procedure.\n\nThe Lisp implementation has 3 distinct value types, ATOM, INT, and LAMBDA. Each value only consumes one QFT byte of memory; the ATOM value holds the pointer to the symbol’s string hashtable, the INT value holds the signed integer value, and LAMBDA holds a pointer to the Lambda struct, as well as its subtype information, of either LAMBDA, MACRO, TEMPLAMBDA and TEMPMACRO. (The TEMPLAMBDA and TEMPMACRO subtypes are lambda and macro types that recycles its argument value memory space every time it is called, but is unused in the final lisp programs.) Since the RAM’s address space is only 10 bits, there are 6 free bits that can be used for addresses holding pointers. Therefore, the value type and subtype information is held in these free bits. This makes the integer in the Lisp implementation to be a 14-bit signed integer, ranging from -8192 to 8191.\n\nSince the C compiler used in this project does not have memory optimization features, this has to be done manually within the C source code. This led to the largest reason why the interpreter’s source code seems to be obfuscated.\n\nOne of the largest bottlenecks for memory access was stack region usage. Every time a stack region memory access occurs, the assembly code performs memory address offset operations to access the stack region. This does not happen when accessing the heap memory, since there is only one heap region used in the entire program, so the pointers for global variables can be hard-coded by the assembler. Therefore, it is favorable optimization-wise to use the heap memory as much as possible.\n\nOne way to make use of this fact is to use as much global variables as possible. Since registers and common RAM memory share the same memory space, global variables can be accessed with a speed comparable to registers (However, since the physical location of the RAM memory slot within the pattern affects the I/O signal arrival time, and the registers have the most smallest RAM addresses, i.e. they are the closest to the CPU unit, the registers have the fastest memory access time).\n\nAnother method of saving memory was to use union memory structures to minimize the stack region usage. In the C compiler used in this project, every time a new variable is introduced in a function, the function’s stack region usage (used per call) is increased to fit all of the variables. This happens even when two variables never appear at the same time. Therefore, using the fact that some variables never appear simultaneously, unions are used for every occurence of such variables, so that they can use a shared region within the stack space. This led to minimization of the stack region usage. Since the stack region is only 233 hextets (1 byte in the QFT RAM is 16 bits) large, this allowed to increase the number of nested function calls, especially the nested calls of eval which evaluates the S-expressions. Since the S-expressions have a list structure, and eval becomes nested when lambdas are called in the Lisp program, this optimization was significant for allowing more sophisticated Lisp programs to be run in the architecture.\n\nThe QFT assembly generated by the C compiler has a lot of room for optimization. I therefore created a compiler optimization tool to reduce the QFTASM assembly size.\n\nImmediate constant expressions such as ADD 1 2 destination is folded to a MOV operation.\n\nThe QFT assembly code can be splitted into subregions by jump operations, such that:\n\nThe last guarantee where jumps never occur in the middle of a subregion is provided by the C compiler. The ELVM assembly’s program counter is designed so that it increases only when a jump instruction appears. This makes an ELVM program counter to point to a sequence of multiple instructions, instead of a single instruction. Since the ELVM assembly uses the ELVM program counter for its jump instructions, it is guaranteed that the jump instructions in the QFT assembly never jump to the middle of any subregion, and always jumps to a beginning of a subregion.\n\nIn each subregion, the dependency graph for the memory address is created. If a memory address becomes written but is later overwritten without becoming used in that subregion at all, the instruction to write to that memory address is removed. Since it is guaranteed that jump operations never jump to the middle of any subregion, it is guaranteed that the overwritten values can be safely removed without affecting the outcome of the program. The MOV folding optimization makes use of this fact to remove unnecessary instructions.\n\nThis folding process is also done with dereferences; if a dereferenced memory address is written, and the address is overwritten without being used at all, and the dereference source is unoverwritten at all during this process, the instruction for writingto the dereferenced memory address is removed.\n\nIf the destination of a conditional or fixed-destination jump instruction points to another jump instruction with a fixed destination, the jump destination is folded to the latter jump instruction’s destination.\n\nA similar folding is done when a fixed jump instruction points to a conditional jump instruction, where the fixed jump instruction is replaced by the latter conditional jump instruction.\n\nIn this image of the CPU and its surrounding modules, the two modules on the top are the ROM modules. The original ROM module had one table, with the memory address as the key and the instruction as the value. I recreated the ROM module to add a lookup table layer, where each distinct instruction (not the opcodes, but the entire instruction including the values used within) holds a distinct serial integer key. The ROM module on the right accepts a program counter address and returns the instruction key for the program counter. The module on the left accepts the instruction key and returns the actual bits of the instruction as the output. This allows for dictionary compression to be performed to the ROM data, saving a lot of space. Since the instructions are 45 bits and the instruction keys are only 10 bits, the instruction key table is 1/4 the size of the original ROM module. Although the ROM size is 3223 for the entire Lisp interpreter, there were only 616 distinct instructions in the Lisp interpreter, making the size of the instruction table be 616 ROM units high, effectively reducing the ROM module size altogether.\n\nThe ROM module features another form of compression, where absence of cells are used to represent 0-valued bits within the instruction. Below is a close-up look of the ROM value module:\n\nNotice that some cells on the left are absent, despite the table being expected to be a rectangular shape. This is because absent cells do not emit any signals, hence effectively emitting 0-valued bits as the output. To use this fact, all of the instructions are first alphabetically ordered at table creation time, so that instructions that start with trailing zeroes become located higher in the table (further from the signal source). This allows for a maximum number of cells to be replaced with absent units to represent 0-valued bits. In fact, the instruction for no-ops is represented as all zeroes, so all of the units in the value module are replaced by absent cells. The no-op instruction appears a lot of times immediately after the jump operation, due to the fact that the QFT architecture has a branch delay when invoking a jump instruction, requiring a no-op instruction to be present to compensate for the delay.\n\nI removed the AND, OR, SL (shift left), SRL (shift right logical), and the SRA (shift right arithmetical) opcodes, and added the SRU (shift right unit) and SRE (shift right eight) opcodes to the architecture. Since there already were opcodes for XOR (bitwise-xor) and ANT (bitwise-and-not), AND and OR, which were not used much in the interpreter, could be replaced by these opcodes. The bitshift operations had significantly larger patterns than the other opcodes, being more than 10 times larger than the other opcodes. These were reduced to a fixed-size shift operations which could be implemented in the same sizes as the other opcodes. Since the shift left opcode can be replaced by consecutively adding its own value, effectively multiplying by powers of 2, the opcode was safely removed. The main reason for the original bitshift units being large was due to the shift amounts being dependent on the values of the RAM. Converting a binary value to a physical (in-pattern) shift amount required a large pattern. On the other hand, shifting a fixed value could be implemented by a significantly more simpler pattern. The shift right eight instruction is mainly used for reading out the standard input, where each ASCII character in the input string is packed into one 16-bit RAM memory address.\n\nThis resulted in a total of exactly 8 opcodes, ANT, XOR, SRE, SRU, SUB, ADD, MLZ, and MNZ. Since this can fit in 3 bits, the opcode region for the instruction value was reduced by 1 bit. Since the RAM module is 10 bits, and the third value of the instruction is always the writing destination of the RAM, and the first instruction can also be made so that it becomes the reading source address of the RAM, this allows for an additional 6*2=12 bits to be reduced from the instruction length. These altogether has reduced the ROM word size from 58 to 45 bits, reducing nearly 1/4 of the original instruction size.\n\nThe original QFT architecture had a ROM and RAM address space of 9 and 7 bits. I extended the ROM and RAM address space to 12 and 10 bits, respectively. This was not a straightforward task as it first seemed, since the signal arrival timings between the modules had to be carefully adjusted in order for the signals to line up correctly. This involved reverse-engineering and experimenting undocumented VarLife pattern units used in the original QFT architecture. The same held for when redesigning other parts of the architecture.\n\nSince each byte of the RAM module can be ordered arbitrarily in the CPU’s architecture, the RAM is arranged so that the standard output is written at the very bottom of the RAM module, and proceeds upwards. Therefore, the contents of the RAM can easily be observed in a Game of Life viewer by directly examining the bottom of the RAM module.\n\nSince RAM has 16 bits of memory per memory address, it allows to fit two ASCII-encoded characters per one address. Therefore, the standard input is read out by reading two characters per address. For the standard output, one character is written to one address for aesthetic reasons, so that the characters can be directly observed in a Game of Life viewer the pattern more easily. Also, for the standard output to proceed upwards within the RAM module pattern, the memory pointer for the standard output proceeds backwards in the memory space, while the pointer for the standard input proceeds forwards in the memory space.\n\nOptimizing the Game of Life layer mainly revolved around understanding the Macrocell format for representing and saving Game of Life patterns, and the Hashlife algorithm. The Macrocell format uses quadtrees and memoization for compressing repeated patterns. Since the final Game of Life pattern is an array of OTCA metapixels which are 2048x2048 large, and even has repeated patterns in the VarLife layer (meaning that there are repeated configurations of OTCA metapixels), this compression reduces the file size for the QFT pattern significantly. The best example that let me understand the Macrocell format was an example provided by Adam P. Goucher in this thread in Golly’s mailing list.\n\nThe Hashlife algorithm also uses quadtrees and memoization to speed up the Game of Life simulations. This algorithm makes use of the fact that the same pattern in a same time frame influences only a fixed extent of its surrounding regions, hence allowing for memoization.\n\nAs for optimization, I first noticed that the QFT pattern had a 1-pixel high pattern concatenated to the entire pattern. The original QFT pattern in the original QFT repository was carefully designed so that it is composed of 8x8-sized pattern units. Therefore, most of the patterns can be represented by 8x8 tiles. However, since the 1-pixel high pattern at the top creates an offset that shifts away the pattern from this 8x8 grid, it causes the pattern to have fewer repeated patterns if interpreted from the corner of its bounding box, causing the memoization to work inefficiently. I therefore tried putting a redundant cell (which does not interfere with the rest of the pattern) to realign the entire pattern to its 8x8 grid, which actually slightly reduced the resulting Macrocell file size from the original one. Although I didn’t compare the running times, since the Hashlife algorithm uses memoization over repeated patterns as well, I expect this optimization to at least slightly contribute to the performance of the simulation.\n\nAnother optimization was improving the metafier script used to convert VarLife patterns to Game of Life (MetafierV3.py). The original script used a square region to fit the entire pattern to create the quadtree representation. However, since the Lisp in Life VarLife pattern is 968 pixels wide but 42354 pixels high, it tried to allocate a 65536x65536-sized integer array, which was prohibitively large to run. I modified the script so that it uses a rectangular region, where absent regions of the quadtree are represented as absent cells. Although this is very straightforward with the knowledge of the Macrocell format, it was difficult at first until I became fond of the algorithms surrounding the Game of Life.\n\nThe memory region map is carefully designed to save space. This is best described with the operation phases of the interpreter.\n\nVarious precalculations are done after the interpreter starts running. The construction of the string interning hashtable for reserved atoms such as define, quote, etc. are done in this phase. For the GCC-compiled interpreter, some variables that are defined in the QFT memory header are defined in the C source.\n\nSince the outcome of these precalculations are always the same for any incoming Lisp program, this phase is done on the host PC, and the results are saved as ramdump.csv during the QFTASM compile time. The results are then pre-loaded into the RAM when the VarLife and Game of Life patterns are created. This allows to saves some CPU cycles when running the interpreter.\n\nAs explained earlier, the QFT architecture holds register values in the RAM. There are 11 registers, which are placed in the addresses from 0 to 10.\n\nThe reserved values in the image include strings such as reserved atoms and the destinations of the jump hashtable used for evaluation. The rest of the region is used for storing global variables in the interpreter’s C source code.\n\nThe Lisp program provided from the standard input is parsed into S-expressions, which is written into the heap region.\n\nNotice that the string interning hashtables are created in the later end of the stack region. This is because these hashtables are only used during the parsing phase, and can be overwritten during the evaluation phase. For most Lisp programs including the ones in this repository, the stack region does not grow far enough to overwrite these values. This allows to place 3 growing memory regions during the parsing phase, the stack region used for nested S-expressions, the heap region which stores the parsed S-expressions, and the string interning hashtables when new strings are detected within the Lisp program. Newly detected strings such as variable names in the Lisp program are also written into the heap region.\n\nThe heap region is also designed so that it overwrites the standard input as it parses the program. Since older parts of the program can be discarded once it is parsed, this allows to naturally free the standard input region which save a lot of space after parsing. The standard input also gets overwritten by the Standard output if the output is long enough. However, due to this design, long programs may have trouble at parsing, since the input may be overwritten too far and get deleted before it is parsed. A workaround for this is to use indentation which places the program further ahead into the memory, which will prevent the program from being overwritten from the growing heap region. For all of the programs included in this repository, this is not an issue and the programs become successfully parsed.\n\nThis is one of the most interesting ideas in the original QFT project to make the QFT architecture possible. As explained in the original QFT post, the 8 states of VarLife are actually a mixture of 4 different birth/survival rules with binary states. This means that each VarLife cell can only transition between two fixed states, and the birth/survival rule for that cell does not change at any point in time. Moreover, the OTCA Metapixel is designed so that each metapixel can carry its own birth/survival rules. Therefore, each VarLife cell can be enoded into an OTCA Metapixel by specifying its birth/survival rule and the binary state. This means that the array of OTCA Metapixels in the metafied pattern is actually a mixture of metapixels with different birth/survival rules, arranged in a way so that it makes the computation possible.\n\nAfter the program counter is set to 65535 and the program exits, no more ROM and RAM I/O signals become apparent in the entire module.\nThis makes the VarLife pattern becomes completely stationary, where every pattern henceforth becomes completely identical.\nDefining this as the halting time for the calculation, the pattern for print.lisp halts at exactly 105,413,068 VarLife generations.\n\nThe halting time for the Game of Life patterns are defined similarly for the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels.\nSince OTCA Metapixels never become stationary, the Game of Life states do not become stationary after the halting time,\nbut the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels will become stationary after the halting time.\n\nFor the VarLife pattern of print.lisp, by generation 105,387,540, the value 65535 gets written to the program counter. At generation 105,413,067, the last signal becomes just one step from disappearing, and at generation 105,413,068 and onwards, the pattern becomes completely stationary and every pattern becomes identical to each other.\nIn the Game of Life version, since the OTCA Metapixel continues running indefinitely, the pattern does not become completly stationary, but the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels will become completely stationary, since it is an emulation of the VarLife pattern.\nNote that the halting times for programs other than print.lisp is just a sufficient number of generations, and not the exact values.\n\nThe required number of generations per CPU cycle depends on many factors such as the ROM and RAM addresses and the types of opcodes, since the arriving times of the I/O signals depend on factors such as these as well. This makes the number of generations required for the program to halt become different between each program.\nFor example, print.lisp has a rate of 23822.16 generations per CPU cycle (GpC), but z-combinator.lisp has a rate of 28870.81 GpC, and primes-print.lisp has 31502.43 GpC. 23822.16 GpC is in fact insufficient for z-combinator.lisp to finish running, and 28870.81 is also insufficient for primes-print.lisp to finish running.\n\nThe ALU unit in the CPU. From the left are the modules for the ANT, XOR, SRE, SRU, SUB, ADD, MLZ, and the MNZ opcodes.\n\nThe SRE and the SRU opcodes were newly added for this project.\n\nThe CPU architecture used in this project was originally created by\nthe members of the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project,\nand was later optimized and modified by Hikaru Ikuta for the Lisp in Life project.\nThe VarLife cellular automaton rule was also defined by the members of the QFT project.\nThe metafier for converting VarLife patterns to Conway’s Game of Life patterns was written by the members of the QFT project,\nand was later modified by Hikaru Ikuta to support the pattern size of the Lisp in Life architecture.\nThe assembly language for the QFT architecture, QFTASM, was also originally designed by the members of the QFT project,\nand was later modified by Hikaru Ikuta for this project for achieving a feasible running time.\nThe Lisp interpreter was written by Hikaru Ikuta.\nThe compilation of the interpreter’s C source code to the ELVM assembly is done using an extended version of 8cc\n\nThe compilation from the ELVM assembly to QFTASM is done by an extended version of ELVM (the Esoteric Language Virtual Machine),\na project by Shinichiro Hamaji from Preferred Networks, Inc.\nThe Game of Life backend for ELVM was written by Hikaru Ikuta, and was later further extended by Hikaru for the Lisp in Life project.",

Mangione's possessions, as described during the hearing, included a MacBook laptop, an iPhone, multiple thumb drives, and a small circuit board wrapped in cardboard.\n\nIt had not been previously revealed that Mangione may have been into crypto. Still, he once gained a small following among crypto investors.\n\nSoon after his arrest, a LUIGI memecoin was launched in his name, and quickly surged in value, reaching a $60 million market capitalization, according to multiple contemporaneous accounts in the crypto press.\n\nJust as quickly, it cratered; a $1,000 investment made at the coin's launch, in mid-December 2024, would be worth about $25 now.\n\nMangione's evidence suppression hearing is scheduled to start its third week on Tuesday.",

My wife posted in a local email group and a potential buyer got in touch with a question.\n\n\"Do you happen to know the model? I would love to look it up online rather than asking you lots of questions. :) Thanks!\" she wrote.\n\nThis is an old couch, so all product codes dissolved in the sands of time years ago. So, I took two photos of the furniture, uploaded them to Gemini, and asked for help. The Google chatbot sent back its best guess in seconds:\n\n\"Tillary Sectional: This is a very popular, modular West Elm sofa that was available around that time.\n\nAppearance Match: The low back and deep seat are very characteristic of the Tillary. The Tillary is known for having interchangeable backrests that can be moved or removed, and your sofa's armless chaise and backrests look like they might be loose cushions or pieces, which is a key Tillary feature.\n\nNote: Search results show the Tillary was being reviewed and discussed around 2014, making it a strong possibility for a 2013 purchase.\"\n\nGemini also shared other useful tips on how to identify the product, such as \"Some West Elm couches have a zippered compartment on the back or bottom where extra components (like legs or connectors) are stored, and a tag may be inside.\"\n\nThat was enough to find a product match and send all the details over to the buyer. We closed the deal, for $200, on Tuesday. That's enough for 10 months of a Gemini Pro subscription.\n\nThis holiday period, the Barr family plans to spend a lot of time slouching on our new, fancy couch. I call it the \"AI bubble couch.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Bruno Mars is back at Dolby Live in Las Vegas for NYE 2025. Both shows are sold out — here's how to get Bruno Mars tickets for future residency dates.",
    "fullText": "Bruno Mars continues to electrify audiences with his long‑running Dolby Live at Park MGM residency on the Las Vegas Strip, which first launched in 2016 and has become one of the city's most in‑demand concert experiences. As of now, Mars has special New Year's Eve performances scheduled for December 30 and 31, 2025, both of which are sold out due to high demand and limited availability. If you're planning a future trip to Vegas and want to catch him live, below is a complete guide on how to buy Bruno Mars tickets and where to look for coming shows.\n\nMars first rose to mainstream success with his breakout 2010 hit \"Just the Way You Are,\" and more than 15 years later, he remains a global superstar, delivering chart‑topping music alongside unforgettable live performances. His Dolby Live residency has become a staple of the Las Vegas entertainment scene, with over 100 shows spanning nine years and multiple extended runs due to overwhelming fan interest. Whether you're drawn by classics like \"24K Magic\" or his newer collaborations, seeing Bruno Mars in Vegas is consistently rated as one of the city's most exciting live music experiences.\n\nWe've got you covered if you're looking for how to get tickets to Bruno Mars' 2025 Las Vegas residency concert dates. Here's our breakdown of Bruno Mars' 2025 concert schedule, purchasing details, and price comparisons between original and resale tickets. You can also browse ticket specifics on StubHub and Vivid Seats at your leisure.\n\nBruno Mars only has two shows scheduled for the remainder of 2025, both at Park MGM in Las Vegas. Prices are high because of the holiday season and limited windows to see the artist live.\n\nYou can buy original tickets for Bruno Mars' 2025 Las Vegas residency on Ticketmaster. As of writing, all concert dates have tickets available; however, original tickets sold out for the 2024 residency, so we expect to see that trend continue in 2025.\n\nTickets are also available for purchase through resale ticket vendors such as StubHub and Vivid Seats, and they are currently comparable in price to the original tickets. Since the original tickets are expected to sell out, you may find better luck with seating variety and pricing options through these resale sites.\n\nAs is typically the case with Las Vegas shows, several VIP packages are available. These packages include a range of different perks, from seats to suites, so if you are looking to plan a trip around your visit, it may be worth reviewing your options. Additional information on what each package includes and the prices can be found here.\n\nFrankly, tickets to see Bruno Mars' Las Vegas residency in 2025 aren't cheap, but prices do vary depending on the date and demand for each show.\n\nThe most affordable tickets start at $678 from Vivid Seats and $930 from StubHub, as of the time of writing.\n\nBruno Mars' Las Vegas concert dates will not feature opening acts. This is consistent with his previous residency, so we do not expect any openers to be announced. In the past, Anderson.Paak, Camila Cabello, and Dua Lipa have opened for Mars on tour.\n\nThere are currently no international tour dates announced, as Mars is currently scheduled to perform exclusively in Las Vegas.\n\nNote: Certain services and regions prohibit the resale of tickets. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal reselling of tickets, and entry into an event is at the venue's discretion.",

    "description": "Zillow analyzed millions of listings to forecast home design trends for 2026. Spa-like amenities and color drenching are in, while man caves are out.",
    "fullText": "Another year is on the way, and with it comes a fresh wave of home design trends. Zillow analyzed hundreds of design styles and home features across millions of for-sale listings in 2025, and identified the top emerging home trends for 2026.\n\n\"Listing descriptions are short, so every word counts,\" said Zillow's home trends expert Amanda Pendleton. \"When we see a sharp increase in certain features being mentioned in listings on Zillow, whether it's spa-inspired bathrooms or bespoke artisan craftsmanship, it's a clear signal that these details are capturing buyers' attention right now and hint at what's next in home design.\"\n\nWhile some of 2025's biggest home trends, such as eco-friendly homes and spa-style wellness amenities, will carry into 2026, new ones are also emerging.\n\nHere are seven home trends to watch in 2026 according to Zillow, from the evolution of the \"man cave\" into immersive sports spaces, to the growing demand for cozy reading nooks.\n\nMillennial gray is so 2020. There's a whole rainbow out there, and today's homeowners want bold, vivid color in their homes.\n\nZillow found that \"color drenching\" will be one of the hottest interior design trends in 2026. That's when the interior surfaces — from walls to floors and sometimes even the furniture — are all the same hue, typically a vibrant statement shade.\n\nMentions of the trend have increased by 149% since 2025, according to the company.\n\nZillow found that words like \"sustainable\" and \"green\" are appearing 21% more often in listings, suggesting that buyers are increasingly seeking out eco-friendly homes.\n\nEco-friendly homes do more than help the planet. They can also help homeowners save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by cutting energy use and, in turn, lowering utility bills.\n\nMentions of zero-energy-ready homes — which are built to minimize energy use and maximize renewable production with features like advanced insulation and high-performance windows — are up 70%.\n\nListings mentioning whole-home batteries, which store solar energy and provide backup power, are also up 40%, while references to electric-vehicle charging have climbed 25%.\n\nFrom the Palisades wildfires to the Texas Hill Country floods, this year's natural disasters have claimed many lives and cost the US government and its citizens billions of dollars.\n\nSo it's no surprise that many buyers are seeking homes that offer better protection during extreme weather conditions. According to Zillow, 64% more listings mention flood protection, and references to elevation in relation to flooding have increased by 26%.\n\nBuyers are also increasingly worried about fire risk. Zillow data shows fire-safety features are appearing more often in listings, with mentions of defensible-space landscaping up 36% and fire-protection systems up 28%.\n\nIn a culture built on convenience, anything you can get at home quickly becomes something you expect at home.\n\nMany homeowners have moved beyond standard home-wellness amenities, such as home gyms and basketball courts, and into upgrades like saunas and cold plunges — features once limited to luxury spas but now increasingly attainable through thoughtful home design.\n\nWellness is set to remain a key driver of home design in 2026. According to Zillow, mentions of wellness features in listings are up 33%, and spa-inspired elements are appearing 22% more often on the site.\n\nNews flash: reading is cool again.\n\nIf you've been on social media lately, you've probably seen the chic home libraries that young, design-minded homeowners are putting together. Big or small, they tend to be cozy and highly Instagrammable.\n\nBuyers are taking note as we head into next year. Zillow found that mentions of \"reading nooks\" are appearing 48% more often in its listings.\n\nBuyers are increasingly moving away from generic, copy-and-paste interiors in favor of homes that reflect their personalities.\n\nAccording to Zillow, mentions of vintage accents, whimsical details, and artisan craftsmanship are up 17%, 15%, and 21%, respectively.\n\nThe once-ubiquitous \"man cave\" is finally fading, with Zillow data showing mentions in listings down 10% from last year — but spouses shouldn't celebrate just yet.\n\nBuyers don't just want a room to watch the game anymore; they want spaces that let them fully immerse themselves in their favorite sports.\n\nZillow found that golf simulators are appearing 25% more frequently in listings on its site, while mentions of pickleball courts are also up 25%. Even batting cages are becoming more popular, with references rising 18%.",

Bradbury, the deputy secretary of Transportation and a representative for Duffy to Amtrak's board, said in a statement.\n\nAmtrak did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that around 246 Amtrak managers gave up part of their bonuses that totaled $16.2 million. The DOT did not provide additional comment or confirm those figures when reached by Business Insider.\n\nIn its announcement, the DOT touted Amtrak's record-breaking year. The national passenger rail service had a record 34.5 million customer trips in the fiscal year that ended in September, posting a record adjusted ticket revenue of $2.7 billion.\n\nThe bonuses were reminiscent of some received by other transportation workers this holiday season. The Federal Aviation Administration said it was giving $10,000 bonuses to the nearly 800 air traffic controllers who had perfect attendance during the government shutdown.\n\nHave a tip?

The celebrated neurologist who taught generations to see the poetry in damaged brains invented a lot of that poetry himself.\n\nAccording to a devastating new investigation by Rachel Aviv in The New Yorker, many of the vivid details in Sacks's beloved case studies were fabrications — embellishments designed to make better stories.\n\nThe man who mistook his wife for a hat?

The twins' supposed prime-number abilities were \"widely cited\" in academic literature. Medical schools assigned his books. The whole notion that doctors should see patients as narrative beings, not just bundles of symptoms, drew heavily from his work.\n\nSacks spent decades in therapy exploring why he couldn't stop embellishing.

    "title": "The Coming Need for Formal Specification",
    "description": "The potential of formal verification for reasoning about systems.",
    "fullText": "In late 2022, I had a conversation with a senior engineer on the coming problem\nof “what to do when AI is writing most of the code”. His opinion, which I found\nstriking at the time, was that engineers would transition from writing mostly\n“implementation” code, to mostly writing tests and specifications.\n\nI remember thinking at the time that this was prescient. With three years of\nhindsight, it seems like things are trending in a different direction. I\nthought that the reason that testing and specifications would be useful was\nthat AI agents would be struggling to “grok” coding for quite some time, and\nthat you’d need to have robust specifications such that they could stumble\ntoward correctness.\n\nIn reality, AI written tests were one of the first tasks I felt comfortable\ndelegating. Unit tests are squarely in-distribution for what the models have\nseen on all public open source code. There’s a lot of unit tests in open source\ncode, and they follow predictable patterns. I’d expect that the variance of\nimplementation code – and the requirement for out-of-distribution patterns –\nis much higher than testing code. The result is that models are now quite good\nat translating English descriptions into quite crisp test cases.1\n\nThere exists a higher level problem of holistic system behavior verification,\nthough. Let’s take a quick diversion into systems design to see why.\n\nSystem design happens on multiple scales. You want systems to be robust – both\nin their runtime, and their ability to iteratively evolve. This nudges towards\ndecomposing systems into distinct components, each of which can be internally\ncomplicated but exposes a firm interface boundary that allows you to abstract\nover this internal complexity.\n\nIf we design things well, we can swap out parts of our system without disrupting\nother parts or harming the top-level description of what the system does. We can\nalso perform top-down changes iteratively – adding new components, and retiring\nold ones, at each level of description of the system.\n\nThis all requires careful thinking of how to build these interfaces and\ncomponent boundaries in such a way that (1) there is a clean boundary between\ncomponents and (2) that stringing all the components together actually produces\nthe desired top-level behavior.\n\nTo do this effectively, we require maps of various levels of description of the\nsystem’s\nterritory. My\nconjecture is that code is not a good map for this territory.\n\nTo be clear, I’ve found a lot of value in throwing out system diagram maps and\nlooking directly at the code territory when debugging issues. However,\ncode-level reasoning is often not the best level of abstraction to use for\nreasoning about systems. This is for a similar reason that “modeling all the\nindividual molecules of a car” is not a great way to estimate that car’s braking\ndistance.\n\nLLMs have increasingly longer context windows, so one could naively say “just\nthrow all the code in the context and have it work it out”. Perhaps. But this is\nstill just clearly not the most efficient way to reason about large-scale\nsystems.\n\nThe promise of formal verification is that we can construct provably composable\nmaps which still match the ground-level territory. Formal verification of code\nallows you to specify a system using mathematical proofs, and then exhaustively\nprove that a system is correct. As an analogy: unit tests are like running an\nexperiment. Each passing test is an assertion that, for the conditions checked,\nthe code is correct. There could still exist some untested input that would\ndemonstrate incorrect behavior. You only need one negative test to show the code\nis incorrect, but only a provably exhaustive set of inputs would be sufficient\nto show the code is fully correct. Writing a formal verification of a program is\nmore like writing a proof. Writing a self-consistent proof is sufficient to show\nthat the properties you’ve proven always hold.\n\nI saw Martin Kleppmann’s\n“Prediction: AI will make formal verification go mainstream”\nright after I posted\n“The Decline of the Software Drafter?”,\nwhich became the inspiration for this post. Kleppmann’s argument is that, just\nas the cost of generating code is coming down, so too will the cost of formal\nverification of code:\n\nFor example, as of 2009, the formally verified seL4 microkernel consisted of\n8,700 lines of C code, but proving it correct required 20 person-years and\n200,000 lines of Isabelle code – or 23 lines of proof and half a person-day\nfor every single line of implementation. Moreover, there are maybe a few\nhundred people in the world (wild guess) who know how to write such proofs,\nsince it requires a lot of arcane knowledge about the proof system.\n\nIf formal verification becomes vastly cheaper, then we can afford to verify\nmuch more software. But on top of that, AI also creates a need to formally\nverify more software: rather than having humans review AI-generated code, I’d\nmuch rather have the AI prove to me that the code it has generated is correct.\nIf it can do that, I’ll take AI-generated code over handcrafted code (with all\nits artisanal bugs) any day!\n\nI’ve long been interested in formal verification tools like TLA+ and Rocq (née\nCoq). I haven’t (yet) been able to justify to myself spending all that much time\non them. I think that’s changing: the cost of writing code is\ncoming down dramatically.\nThe cost of reviewing\nand maintaining it is also coming down, but at a slower rate. I agree with\nKleppmann that we need systematic tooling for dealing with this mismatch.\n\nWishcasting a future world, I\nwould be excited to see something like:\n\nThe biggest concern to me related to formal verification is the following two\nexcerpts, first from Kleppmann, and then from Hillel Wayne, a notable proponent\nof TLA+:\n\nThere are maybe a few hundred people in the world (wild guess) who know how to\nwrite such proofs, since it requires a lot of arcane knowledge about the proof\nsystem. –\nMartin Kleppmann\n\nTLA+ is one of the more popular formal specification languages and you can\nprobably fit every TLA+ expert in the world in a large schoolbus. –\nHillel Wayne\n\nFor formal verification to be useful in practice, at least some of the arcane\nknowledge of its internals will need to be broadly disseminated. Reviewing an\nAI-generated formal spec of a problem won’t be useful if you don’t have enough\nknowledge of the proof system to poke holes in what the AI came up with.\n\nI’d argue that undergraduate Computer Science programs should allocate some of\ntheir curriculum to formal verification. After all, students should have more\ntime on their hands as they delegate implementation of their homework to AI\nagents.\n\nThat is, under current optimization pressures. We’re only a few months past\nthe Sonnet 3.7 and\nOpenAI o3 models,\nboth of which had a penchant for reward hacking on tests. ↩︎",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Traveler Should Know",
    "description": "Because visiting exotic locales and experiencing other cultures is a thrill—but getting there can be a drag.",
    "fullText": "We travel for a wide variety of reasons—vacations, business, family obligations—and in a variety of different ways, but there’s one constant: The actual traveling can be hectic, stressful, and expensive. Considering Americans took nearly 2 billion trips in 2025 alone, that stress can be pretty epic. From planning to de-boarding, travel can be a challenge—that is, unless you know and utilize these hacks.\n\nThere are a lot of travel hacks out there in the wild, many of them dubious, but when a hack actually works to lower your costs, increase your comfort, or simply solve an irritating problem, it’s kind of magical. Here are the essential travel hacks everyone should be implementing, whether you’re traveling for pleasure, business, or any other reason.\n\nYou may have been instructed at some point to roll your clothes to make your packing more efficient. It’s not that this doesn’t work—rolling clothes tightly can improve your packing and unpacking experience. But there’s an even better way: Vacuum-sealing. You can use vacuum-sealed storage bags to compress your clothes, allowing you to fit more into your bag (or to travel much lighter with a single carry-on), but there’s a downside: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may require you to uncompress your clothes for a special check as you pass through security, which can wreak havoc on your packing.\n\nA better choice is a carry-on backpack with an included pump, like this. If you are flagged for a special inspection, you can quickly re-compress everything and be on your way.\n\nIf your main goal for travel is to see exotic places, have new experiences, or even see old friends, traveling off-peak is a powerful hack. Off-peak simply means going places when most tourists aren’t there. Most people travel for pleasure during the warmer months, for example, so deciding you’re going on a European tour in February nets you cheaper flights, cheaper hotel rooms, and less crowded everything.\n\nRaise your hand if this has ever happened to you: You realize you need something from a piece of luggage you spent six hours carefully organizing, compressing, and zipping closed. You dig through everything to find what you need, and then re-packing that bag is a sweaty, stressful fail. That’s where packing cubes come in.\n\nPacking cubes don’t necessarily shrink your clothes and other possessions, but they make the whole experience of packing, unpacking, and actually finding stuff while you’re traveling much easier. They turn your chaotic piles of clothing and supplies into geometric cubes that can be organized individually and removed and replaced in your luggage easily. Because you’re dealing with uniform cubes, popping stuff in and out of your suitcase won’t result in a nervous breakdown, either.\n\nIt’s truly a time to be alive: You can now purchase so-called “basic” economy airline seats that don’t allow a carry-on. And carry-on fees and restrictions are increasing as well. If you’re attempting to travel with just one small bag, you may find it a struggle—and that’s where the pillow hack comes into play. The basic idea is simple: Grab a neck pillow or pillowcase, remove the stuffing, and jam in some extra clothes instead. The pillow can still be used as a pillow (your clothes act as the cushion), but you get to smuggle extra stuff on the plane. It does work, though it works best with the neck pillow option—bringing an enormous pillowcase filled with jeans and T-shirts is going to be less successful fooling unamused flight crews.\n\nEntertaining yourself on long flights can be a challenge, especially if your whole survival plan involved sleeping for ten hours and you can’t seem to get comfortable. If your plane doesn’t offer convenient screens (I’m very fond of the “tiny screen up in the air four rows ahead of me” arrangement, myself), or the entertainment choices available aren’t appealing, you can always load up a device with movies, shows, and games.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck with just your phone for a screen, you can improv a phone holder from the barf bag typically supplied in the pocket of the seat in front of you, as demonstrated here. By clipping the bag between your phone and its case, then clipping the top of the bag under the fold-down tray, you can mount your phone horizontally at the right height for watching content. This could be a real sanity-saver (assuming you don't need to use that bag for, well, other purposes).\n\nYou’re spending money practically every day anyway—but by putting all those expenses on a credit card that awards you miles or points toward travel (and then paying that card off in full every month) you’re essentially getting free travel coupons. You’re going to buy groceries anyway, so why not get a hundred miles every time you do? Many travel credit cards offer large sign-up bonuses of anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 points (or more) once you spend a certain amount on the account, so by paying your everyday bills for a few months using the card you can fund an entire trip for free.\n\nBooking a place to stay on your trip can be a hassle, and you have to wonder if you’re getting the best deal. An Airbnb might look ideal but put a big dent in your budget—but it may be listed elsewhere, and possibly for less money. You can find out using Google’s “reverse image lookup.” Pick a photo from the Airbnb listing, search for the image on Google, and other rental platforms will probably show up—or a link to a hotel’s direct web page. If nothing else, the image search might identify the apartment building or hotel depicted, which can give you a leg up on the pricing. There are also tools like HiChee that will compare listings across several platforms for you, but where’s the fun in that?\n\nYou drag yourself, exhausted, into a hotel room at night and don’t notice that the curtains on the windows are hanging loose. You collapse into bed, and then you’re awakened at 6 a.m. by a vengeful sun, shining through the gaps in those curtains. This hack is so simple, but it can make a big difference in your sleep quality: Take a pants hanger from your hotel closet (the ones with the metal clips) and clip your room’s curtain shut. When the morning sunlight tries to infiltrate your room and wake you up first thing in the morning, the clips will keep it out.\n\nIf you use the safe supplied in your hotel room to store some valuables or your essential travel documents, the worst thing you can do is forget them when you check out. A quick hack to ensure that doesn’t happen is to put something you can’t possibly forget in there as well. Some folks suggest a shoe, figuring that when you’re getting dressed for the next leg of your journey, you’ll definitely notice if one shoe is missing. But this will work with anything, as long as you choose something you can’t possibly leave without.\n\nWe once lived in a world where finding your way around a new area meant paper maps and confusing directions from friends that referenced a lot of fast food restaurants as landmarks. These days, we have access to military-grade GPS systems, and a pleasant computer voice will tell us to turn right in one hundred feet. That’s amazing when you’re traveling in an unfamiliar place—until you lose your internet connection.\n\nA great hack is to download offline maps of your destinations before you leave on your trip. You can do this with Google Maps or using an app like HERE WeGo. This requires some planning, as you have to download the maps while you have a signal, but once you have them downloaded you can use them more or less as you normally would, getting directions and seeing distances clearly. Take a moment to do this before every trip, and you’ll never be lost again.",

    "fullText": "Android users are getting more tools to combat the seemingly endless stream of scam texts from bad actors looking to steal your data and your money. Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act.\n\nTo activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\"\n\nThis is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts.\n\nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call.",

    "fullText": "On Friday, Apple dropped iOS 26.2. Despite being the third update in the iOS 26 era, 26.2 still adds some interesting and useful new features, like alarms for reminders and refinements to the Sleep Score on Apple Watch.\n\nUpdates aren't all about the features, however. Apple typically includes a number of security patches with its software releases as well, which makes each update important to install. You don't always need to install the latest version of iOS or macOS to benefit from these security patches, either: Apple usually releases important security patches for some older versions of its software. iPhones running iOS 18 can install the same security patches as those running iOS 26, as can Mac users running macOS Sequoia or Sonoma, rather than Tahoe.\n\nAll that to say, Apple's update today comes with a series of patches you'll want to install on your iPhone—no matter what software version you're currently running. This particular release ships with 25 patches, and while some of them seem only pertinent to software developers, others are plainly serious.\n\nPerhaps most importantly from a security perspective, this release includes two patches for potential zero-day vulnerabilities. Zero-day flaws are especially dangerous as they are either publicly disclosed or actively exploited before a developer has a chance to issue a patch—leaving users vulnerable to attack.\n\nBoth flaws (CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174) affect WebKit, Apple's platform for developing Safari and web browsers on iPhone. Before Apple patched these issues, bad actors could present users with malicious web content. Once the user processes it on their iPhone, it could lead to arbitrary code execution, which, essentially, allows the bad actor to run whatever code they want on your iPhone. Apple says it is aware of reports that these two flaws may have been exploited in \"an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals\" in versions of iOS older than iOS 26.\n\nThis is not the first time Apple has patched flaws with this warning. Due to the iPhone's popularity, these flaws are valuable to governments and other large-scale actors that target high-profile individuals, like journalists and politicians. Apple will even send these users warnings when their iPhone has been identified in such an attack. While the risk is low that the average iPhone user will be targeted in one of these campaigns, it's not impossible, which means it's important to update as soon as a patch is available. These apply to other Apple devices too, like Macs, so update all devices as soon as possible.\n\nWhile those two flaws are the most important of the bunch to fix, there are others here that you'll want to fix ASAP. One of the first to jump out at me was a \"Calling Framework\" flaw that allows bad actors to spoof their FaceTime caller ID. With the rise of AI scams, bad actors could create an AI voice that sounds like someone you know, and spoof their contact so it looks like they're calling you over FaceTime audio. This update patches that possibility—at least, as far as spoofing is concerned.\n\nSpeaking of FaceTime, this update also patches a flaw that sometimes reveals password fields when remotely controlling a device over FaceTime. If you were sharing your screen with someone over a video call, they might be able to see when you typed in your password and use that against you. There's also a patch for an issue that allowed an app to see other apps you had installed on your device—a major privacy and security vulnerability.\n\nIf you use the Photos' app Hidden feature to hide sensitive pictures you don't want others to see, you'll want to install this update ASAP, too: Previous versions of iOS contained a bug that made it possible to view these hidden photos without authentication.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing all of Apple's security patches in this update, the full release notes are as follows:\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: An app may be able to access sensitive payment tokens\n\nDescription: A permissions issue was addressed with additional restrictions.\n\nCVE-2025-46288: floeki, Zhongcheng Li from IES Red Team of ByteDance\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: Processing a file may lead to memory corruption\n\nDescription: The issue was addressed with improved bounds checks.\n\nCVE-2025-43539: Michael Reeves (@IntegralPilot)\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: An attacker may be able to spoof their FaceTime caller ID\n\nDescription: An inconsistent user interface issue was addressed with improved state management.\n\nCVE-2025-46287: an anonymous researcher, Riley Walz\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: Multiple issues in curl\n\nDescription: This is a vulnerability in open source code and Apple Software is among the affected projects.

    "fullText": "The sheer scope of cybercrime can be hard to fathom, even when you live and breathe it every day. It's not just the volume of data, but also the extent to which it replicates across criminal actors seeking to abuse it for their own gain, and to our detriment.\n\nWe were reminded of this recently when the FBI reached out and asked if they could send us 630 million more passwords. For the last four years, they've been sending over passwords found during the course of their investigations in the hope that we can help organisations block them from future use. Back then, we were supporting 1.26 billion searches of the service each month. Now, it's... more:\n\nJust as it's hard to wrap your head around the scale of cybercrime, I find it hard to grasp that number fully. On average, that service is hit nearly 7 thousand times per second, and at peak, it's many times more than that. Every one of those requests is a chance to stop an account takeover. But the real scale goes well beyond the API itself. Because the data model is open source and freely available, many organisations use the Pwned Passwords Downloader to take the entire corpus offline and query it directly within their own applications. That tool alone calls the API around a million times during download, but the resulting data is then queried… well, who knows how many times after that. Pretty cool, right?\n\nThis latest corpus of data came to us as a result of the FBI seizing multiple devices belonging to a suspect. The data appeared to have originated from both the open web and Tor-based marketplaces, Telegram channels and infostealer malware families. We hadn't seen about 7.4% of them in HIBP before, which might sound small, but that's 46 million vulnerable passwords we weren't giving people using the service the opportunity to block. So, we've added those and bumped the prevalence count on the other 584 million we already had.\n\nWe're thrilled to be able to provide this service to the community for free and want to also quickly thank Cloudflare for their support in providing us with the infrastructure to make this possible. Thanks to their edge caching tech, all those passwords are queryable from a location just a handful of milliseconds away from wherever you are on the globe.\n\nIf you're hitting the API, then all the data is already searchable for you. If you're downloading it all offline, go and grab the latest data now. Either way, go forth and put it to good use and help make a cybercriminal's day just that much harder 😊",

    "title": "Google Removes Sci-Hub Domains from U.S. Search Results Due to Dated Court Order",
    "description": "Google has removed dozens of Sci-Hub domain names from its search results in the U.S., marking the country's first pirate domain removals.",
    "fullText": "In 2017, American Chemical Society (ACS), a leading source of academic publications in the field of chemistry, won a lawsuit against Sci-Hub and its operator, Alexandra Elbakyan.\n\nThe ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ had failed to appear at a Virginia federal court, resulting in an easy win for the publisher and a $4.8 million default judgment award for damages.\n\nMore important, perhaps, was the broad permanent injunction that the Virginia federal court signed off on in 2017. This order effectively gave ACS free rein to take down existing and newly registered Sci-Hub domain names.\n\nThe injunction also required all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to “cease facilitating access” to these domain names, including search engines, hosting providers, ISPs, and domain name registrars, the order clarified.\n\nOn paper, this injunction enabled ACS to request American ISPs and search engines to ‘block’ existing and future Sci-Hub domains. However, there was no sign that the publisher was doing so. Aside from a few suspended domains, Sci-Hub remained widely accessible.\n\nWhether ACS did not feel the need to enforce the order against search engines and other intermediaries or if these companies actively objected to the requested actions was unknown. And as time passed, the injunction became a distant memory, at least for a few years.\n\nEarlier this week we spotted a unique request in the Lumen Database, where the 2018 injunction was cited. The notice in question asks Google to deindex 34 (sub)domains linked to Sci-Hub.\n\nNone of these domains were referenced in the 2018 injunction but are indeed linked to Sci-Hub. Many of the partially redacted domains appear to be domain variations of the scihubtw.tw mirror network, such as edu.scihubtw.tw and freeus.scihubtw.tw.\n\nIt’s surprising to see this type of enforcement seven years after the injunction was issued, but the request is legitimate. Google is certainly taking it seriously and has deindexed these domains from its search results in America. In other countries, the same domains remain accessible.\n\nThe December 2 notice was sent by UK law firm Wiggin LLP, which sent a similar request in September this year, targeting a few dozen other Sci-Hub domains. In total, we spotted seven notices, with the earliest dating back to 2022.\n\nThe results of these removals are also clearly visible in Google search. Those who search for Sci-Hub in the U.S. will see the following notice at the bottom of the results.\n\nIt’s not clear why it took five years before ACS urged Google to take action in response to the injunction. However, these removals are similar to Google’s removal of pirate site domains in other countries in response to ISP-blocking orders. Voluntary cooperation by Google was uncovered shortly before ACS first notified the search engine.\n\nGoogle’s voluntary cooperation with ISP blocking orders in Australia, the Netherlands, France, the UK, and elsewhere also brings up an important question. Is Google cooperating with the permanent injunction in the U.S. because it feels legally compelled to do so, or is that a voluntary gesture too?\n\nThe 2018 injunction requires all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to take action. While search engines are mentioned as an example, Google and other tech companies have previously argued that neutral third-party services are not necessarily “in active concert or participation”.\n\nIt is likely that Google maintains this stance, opting to voluntarily comply with orders targeting other third parties. That would mirror its response to site-blocking orders elsewhere.\n\nWe contacted Google hoping to hear answers to these questions, but the company did not respond to our request for comment.",

    "title": "Four Ways to Fix a Slippery Wood Floor",
    "description": "Wood floors can suddenly and inexplicably become super slippery. There are several ways of dealing with it, from temporary sprays to more permanent anti-slip coatings.",
    "fullText": "Recently, a few spots on the hardwood floors in my house have become mysteriously slippery—so slippery that they're kind of dangerous. I really feel like my feet might go out from under me when I walk there, and there were a few close calls before I started avoiding them (or at least bracing myself to walk over them more carefully).\n\nThis is no way to live, so I started looking into solutions, starting with the root cause.\n\nTurns out it’s not uncommon for hardwood floors to become spontaneously slippery, and it can happen for a variety of reasons.\n\nWax or polish: If you apply any kind of coating to give your floor extra shine, it can build up over time and turn the floor into an ice rink.\n\nOil and silicone cleaning products: Some cleaning products that promise a shiny finish contain silicone or oil, which can also build up and turn your floors into a slip-n-slide.\n\nDirt and humidity: Dirt, even the stuff you can’t see, can act as a dry lubricant, and high humidity can result in a moisture slick on the surface of the floors.\n\nTime: Finally, over time, all those feet walking over the floor can polish the finish, removing the microscopic imperfections that previously gave it some grip.\n\nI don’t polish or wax my floors or use oil- or silicone-based cleaners, and I clean pretty regularly, so I discounted the first few causes and assumed that we’ve just polished the seal on our floors with regular foot traffic. This can happen to any sealed wood floor, but there are some pretty straightforward ways to deal with it.\n\nThe first step I took was a thorough cleaning. I clean my floors regularly, but it’s always possible that something spilled without being noticed—the spots where the slipperiness occurred are in the path from the kitchen to the dining room, and from my tool closet to everywhere else in the house. Cooking oils, WD40—there are a lot of things that could have dripped without being noticed. If you’re not sure about substance buildup on a slippery floor, a thorough cleaning might be the easy solution.\n\nAlways use a pH-neutral cleaner designed specifically for wood floors—and never use vinegar, even heavily diluted in water. Vinegar can eat away at the finish of your floor; while it might help with the slipperiness, it can also do some permanent damage. I used Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner and cleaned the areas a few times, but my floors remained slippery.\n\nA simple solution, especially if you’re dealing with one or two isolated slippery spots, is to just throw down a rug or a runner with a non-slip backing. Your floors will still be slippery, but won’t pose any threat. If the slippery area is quite large (or encompasses your entire floor), this might not work because the rugs might just slide around with nothing to grip onto. But for a small slippery area, it might be a quick, easy solution.\n\nIf cleaning and covering up your slippery floors won’t work, there are some more involved solutions to try:\n\nAnti-slip sprays. There are a variety of temporary anti-slip coating sprays you can apply to your floors, like Rustoleum AntiSlip or Slip Doctors Safety Spray. Although the Rustoleum spray is okay for indoor use and wood, it doesn’t specify hardwood floors, and in a quick test it looked slightly cloudy on a remnant plank I had lying around. The Safety Spray, on the other hand, dried very clear, and reduced the slip factor significantly, so I’d recommend it. It does change the sheen of the floor slightly (noticeable in the right light), but it’s also temporary and will need to be re-applied every year or so.\n\nSlip NoMor. This stuff is actually designed for stages and dance floors, but you can use it on any wood floor. I didn’t test this, but the procedure is pretty straightforward: Clean thoroughly first, and dilute it with one part Slip NoMor and 20 parts water. Then mop it on and let dry. The coating will only last a week or so (and you can remove it with hot water at any time), so it’s not a permanent solution unless you’re okay with re-applying every week or so.\n\nCoatings. A longer-lasting and more involved solution is to coat your floors with a clear anti-slip product like Floor Grip, Bona Anti-Slip, or Loba 2K Invisible. These are essentially new finish seals on your floors, and all require you to sand the floor before application and allow them to cure for several days. It’s a DIY solution if you’re comfortable doing the prep work, but it’s not a quick fix.\n\nPaint. If your wood floors are in good condition, this might not be a great idea—but if your floors are a bit worn down, painting them with an anti-slip additive can be a cheap, easy way to eliminate the problem.\n\nIf cleaning and temporary sprays don’t work and you’re considering a coating to fix your slippery floor, you might think about going all-in and having your floors professionally refinished with an anti-slip finish. This will ensure a consistent finish and refresh your floors in the process. It’s the most expensive and disruptive solution, but also the most permanent. Most professional refinishers can suggest an appropriate seal for your floors that will increase traction.",

    "description": "Deno 2.6 introduces deno audit with a new --socket flag that plugs directly into Socket to bring supply chain security checks into the Deno CLI.",
    "fullText": "Deno 2.6 was released this week with new security improvements that make it easier to catch threats before they hit production. The release introduces a new deno audit command that scans your dependencies against GitHub's CVE database, along with granular controls for lifecycle scripts and minimum dependency age requirements.\n\nDeno 2.6 also includes experimental Socket integration through deno audit --socket, which queries Socket's Firewall API to fetch malicious package detections and supply chain risk indicators in real time. While CVE databases catalog vulnerabilities after they've been discovered and reported, Socket's Firewall analyzes package behavior to catch threats as they emerge, things like typosquatting, malicious install scripts, and obfuscated code that slip past traditional scanners.\n\nSocket's supply chain security risk detection is available through two authentication modes:\n\nUnauthenticated mode provides instant security scanning for any Deno project:\n\nAuthenticated mode applies your organization's security policies when SOCKET_API_KEY is set as an environment variable. Teams can enforce company-wide rules and access detailed threat analysis across their entire dependency graph.\n\nTraditional vulnerability scanning relies on CVE databases, which only catch known exploits after they've been reported and cataloged. Socket's approach analyzes package behavior to detect supply chain attacks before they have a chance to hit your codebase.\n\nWith the Socket integration, Deno users get access to our threat detection for free, with continuous tracking of every package and version on npm (and other popular open source registries). Socket has identified and flagged thousands of malicious packages that will never receive CVEs, including attacks like Shai-Hulud, cryptomining campaigns, and the frequent typosquatting attempts targeting popular packages.\n\nDeno 2.6 integrates tsgo for faster typechecking. The team has observed a 2x speed improvement on type checking times for internal projects. The release also includes several security and dependency management features that complement Socket integration:\n\nGranular script control with deno approve-scripts replaces the previous --allow-scripts flag. When installing packages with lifecycle scripts, Deno prompts you to review and approve each package individually. Your choices persist in deno.json, creating an audit trail of which packages can execute code during installation.\n\nDependency age requirements let you specify minimum package ages in deno.json. Setting \"minimumDependencyAge\": \"7 days\" ensures your project only uses dependencies that have been publicly available long enough for the community to identify potential issues.\n\nThe dx command provides an npx-equivalent for running package binaries. While it defaults to full permissions like npx, it prompts before downloading packages and running lifecycle scripts, giving you visibility into what code executes during installation.\n\nCheck out the Deno 2.6 announcement post",

    "description": "As an EV perk comes to an end, solo drivers must exit the HOV lane or face a fine.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nSolo EV drivers using California carpool lanes will face ticketing beginning Monday as the perk disappears.\n\nThough the benefit, courtesy of the California’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal program, technically ended for solo drivers a few months ago, the Department of Motor Vehicles offered a 60-day grace period that ended Monday. Now, solo drivers face fines of up to $490.\n\nWith this, most carpool lanes require vehicles with more than two people.\n\nAs of Aug. 14, more than half a million motorists statewide had an active decal on their vehicle to access carpool lanes. California has an estimated 1,171 carpool lane-miles, with 803 miles in Southern California and 366 miles in Northern California, according to a UC Berkeley study.\n\nWith more than 35 million total registered vehicles in California, that means 1% to 2% of the vehicle fleet will lose access to the carpool lane, said Antonio Bento, professor of public policy and economics at USC.\n\nExperts say the impact for commuters will be minimal with all the solo EV vehicles returning to the general lanes because traffic is already terrible, according to experts.\n\nFederal legislation has allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to grant solo drivers in low-emission and energy-efficient cars to use the carpool, or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV), lane.\n\nThe goal was to promote the adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles and assist in meeting environmental goals that included reducing fuel consumption and pollution caused by congested freeways, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nOver time, states developed incentive programs, choosing which car models to give carpool access to.\n\nCalifornia is one of 13 states that offered this type of incentive program to its residents. Qualified drivers in the Golden State include those who drive fuel cell electric, natural gas or plug-in electric cars.\n\nIn 2015, Congress authorized California’s program through a highway funding bill, but that authorization expired Sept. 30.\n\nIn an effort to extend the decal program, state Assemblymember Greg Wallis (R-Bermuda Dunes) wrote Assembly Bill 2678, which would push the end date to Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year.\n\nBut the change never got the required federal approval so the extension was moot.",

    "title": "I Tried the New Sunscreen Ingredient the FDA Is Finally Approving After Over 20 Years",
    "description": "We're about to get sunscreens that are safer, more effective, and less goopy.",
    "fullText": "Some unexpected good news from the FDA: bemotrizinol, a sunscreen ingredient that has been used in Europe and Asia for decades, is finally being added to the allowable ingredients list for products sold in the U.S. Bemotrizinol is the active ingredient in sunscreens like Bioré Watery Essence, which has a cult following for being unlike anything we can get in the U.S.\n\nI’ve tried Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence (that’s the full name of the product) in its original Japanese formulation. This sunscreen is a cult favorite on skincare and Asian beauty forums because of its non-greasy feel, and because it protects against both UVA and UVB rays without leaving a white cast. I got mine from a friend who had either picked it up while traveling or possibly ordered from overseas; you can’t buy it in U.S.-based stores.\n\nI’ll explain why this is below, but first: it truly is nothing like anything we have locally. Even our most “non-greasy” sunscreens tend to feel a little goopy or sticky. This one really feels like nothing after you rub it in. I instantly understood why it’s so sought-after. Remembering that experience, I’m looking forward to what we might see in American sunscreens once manufacturers are allowed to include this ingredient.\n\nBemotrizinol has a lot of things going for it. One is that it “plays well with other sunscreen ingredients,” as one dermatologist told Women’s Health. You can make lighter, nicer-feeling sunscreens with it, hence the popularity of the Bioré formulation I tried. To see what I mean, check out this video where a dermatologist shows off the differences between Bioré's Japanese formulation and the version it sells in the U.S. The ingredients are different, and the texture just isn't the same.\n\nIt’s also more effective at broad-spectrum protection. With our current sunscreen formulations, all active ingredients protect against UVB rays (the rays that cause sunburn) but only a few can also provide protection against UVA rays (which contribute to wrinkling and aging of skin). UVB is considered to be the bigger risk for skin cancer, but both probably contribute to cancer risk. Right now, most broad-spectrum U.S. sunscreens use mineral components like zinc oxide. Mineral sunscreens work pretty well, but can leave a white cast on your skin when applied as thickly as you’re supposed to.\n\nBemotrizinol is a chemical UV filter, so it doesn’t leave that white cast. But it protects well against UVA rays in addition to UVB, and it’s more photostable than a lot of our existing chemical sunscreen ingredients so it can last longer on the skin. In other words, it’s a chemical sunscreen, but combines some of the best features of both chemical and mineral sunscreens.\n\nIt’s also considered to be one of the safest sunscreens. All sunscreens on the market are much safer than going without sunscreen, but all of our chemical sunscreen ingredients are currently undergoing a safety evaluation because regulators determined they are probably fine but need more research to know for sure. Currently only our two mineral sunscreen ingredients (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) are considered GRAS, or generally recognized as safe and effective. Bemotrizinol will be the third.\n\nIf you're looking at ingredient lists on Asian or European sunscreens, be aware that it goes by several names. Tinosorb S is bemotrizinol; so is bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine.\n\nAsk anyone in the skincare world what they think about U.S. sunscreens, and for decades now you’d get complaints that we’re missing out on the best sunscreens that the rest of the world uses. (Our last new sunscreen ingredient was approved in 1996.) In most countries, sunscreens are regulated as cosmetics, but in the U.S. they are regulated as drugs. That means the U.S. requires more rigorous testing and approval.\n\nThe CARES act, passed in 2020 for pandemic relief, provided a way for over-the-counter drugs to be sold without going through the complete approval process, so long as the FDA was satisfied they were safe and effective. Bemotrizinol met the criteria, thanks in large part to the fact that it’s been used safely since 2000 in Europe, Asia, and Australia. The FDA’s rule on bemotrizinol still needs to be finalized, but it seems likely we’ll see new sunscreens on shelves before the end of 2026.",

    "description": "Animated animals, bouncing balls, and timers turn quiet time into a game.",
    "fullText": "Whether you're a teacher, a parent, or just someone with a big family, you know how difficult it can be to keep a room full of kids quiet for any amount of time.\n\nOne trick I've used is offering to time how long kids can stay quiet. For reasons I don't understand, kids love it when something is being timed. But that only work a few times at the most, so it's good to have as many other tricks on hand as possible. That's why I was fascinated to learn there are multiple websites that use the microphone on your laptop to motivate kids to be quiet. Some put children's curiosity to work, having animated characters show up if the group is quiet for long enough. Others combine animation with good old-fashioned timers.\n\nHere are a few you can check out—all of them are completely free and don't require anything more than your browser.\n\nSilent Forest shows a simple animated forest with a volume indicator. Stay silent for a bit and a cat shows up. A bit longer and a bear shows up. Who else might join? There's only one way to find out. Make too much noise, though, and you'll scare the animals, meaning you have to start over if you ever want to see everyone. The idea is that the kids will be curious to see which animals will show up next and keep quiet—and, ideally, pressure each other into staying quiet.\n\nBouncy Balls fills your screen with balls—options include colored balls, emojis, numbered balls, eyeballs, and even bubbles. The balls are constantly vibrating, threatening to explode with a bit of noise—which they do. There's a risk of this backfiring—it's sincerely very fun to see the balls bounce—which you can mitigate by enabling a shushing or beeping sound after any violation.\n\nClassroom Zen offers a few different tools for keeping the room quiet. Two feature Ruby, a cartoon who is meditating in either the mountains or the desert. If the room gets too loud, her eyes will start opening—keep going and she'll ask the room to be quiet. Another features Milo, a three-eyed monster who is trying to sleep.\n\nThe secret sauce here, though, is the timer at the top of the screen. This means you can tell the kids they need to be quiet for a certain amount of time and have a timer to enforce that.",

    "fullText": "Auchinleck Talbot have taken the \"difficult and extremely disappointing\" decision to move their Scottish Cup fourth round tie against Celtic to Kilmarnock's Rugby Park.\n\nThe West of Scotland League Premier Division side say there were concerns over whether surrounding infrastructure could cope with such a high-profile event, having taken advice from the Scottish FA and Police Scotland.\n\nThe Ayrshire club's Beechwood Park ground holds 4,000 people, compared to the 15,000-capacity stadium 15 miles up the A76.\n\nThe tie between the sixth-tier outfit and the 42-time champions will take place on Sunday, 18 January and will be broadcast live on Premier Sports.\n\nIn a statement, Auchinleck Talbot said: \"Following various meetings and lengthy discussions involving East Ayrshire Council, Police Scotland, and the Scottish Football Association, the club has taken the difficult and extremely disappointing decision to relocate our Men's Scottish Cup fourth round tie against Celtic to Rugby Park.\n\n\"Although Beechwood Park meets and goes beyond the SFA Club Licensing Entry Level criteria in certain areas, various concerns the club could not ignore arose in relation to the ability of the surrounding infrastructure to cope with such a high-profile event that has brought worldwide interest to the village of Auchinleck and Auchinleck Talbot F.C.\n\n\"The club thanks East Ayrshire Council Events & Resilience, Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Celtic F.C. & Kilmarnock F.C. for their input and assistance during this process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, BBC Scotland will broadcast two fourth-round ties.\n\nDunfermline welcome Hibernian to East End Park live on BBC One Scotland on Saturday, 17 January (12:30 GMT), while Aberdeen host Raith Rovers on the same channel on Sunday, 18 January (14:30 GMT).",

    "fullText": "Glasgow Warriors going up against the mighty Toulouse at Scotstoun on Saturday might well be the match of the weekend in round two of the Champions Cup.\n\nThe six-time European champions are as close to rugby's version of Real Madrid as you will find, and like the Spanish footballing giants in their 'Galacticos' era, they are stacked with world-class stars.\n\nChief among them is incredible France scrum-half Antoine Dupont, who most would agree is the world's best player. Some would argue he is the game's greatest ever.\n\n\"Everyone sees it, whenever he plays, he makes a massive difference to not only Toulouse, but to the French squad as well,\" said Glasgow Warriors' Ollie Smith, who will start on the wing at Scotstoun.\n\n\"I think he has a lot of firepower and it doesn't matter if he's on the back foot or the front foot, he seems to create things and see space that no-one else sees. He always seems to pop up in the right position, so he's definitely going to be difficult to play against.\n\n\"But rather than being worried about playing such a formidable team, I think you have to get excited and put your best foot forward and almost stun them, surprise them with what we can do, because we're confident as a group that we can put in a performance that deserves a win.\"",

I think we had enough to win today.\n\n\"We talked in the week about belief, being aggressive and taking the game to them and I think we did that in the first half. We executed our game plan brilliantly and had the lead at half-time with two moments of magic.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, we just ran out of steam and our discipline let us down.\n\n\"We said at the end in the huddle that if we don't believe now that we're good enough, then I don't know what we need, because that's one of the best teams in club rugby in the world and we've gone toe-to-toe with them.\n\n\"We can be proud of our fight and our effort, but that's not good enough - we want to go beyond that now. We've got the fight and the effort, now we need to go and win games, but it's definitely there, which is good.\"\n\nTigers head coach Geoff Parling told Premier Sports:\n\n\"I'm proud of the way the group stood up for each other.\n\n\"I didn't think things went for us in the game. We've just got to learn that when we feel we're not getting the calls we deserve, what can we do to really tighten up and be more accurate in what we do?\n\n\"We had 37% territory in that game, so we played a lot in our half. I thought we defended so well for each other, but you saw at the top level of the game that one little moment where a ball kicks out of a scrum, that's the difference between winning and losing.\n\n\"The young lads I've got here continue to surprise me with the way they work for each other and step up. As long as we learn from what we doing, we're certainly not dead in the competition. There are two games to come and we know how this competition works.\"\n\nLeinster head coach Leo Cullen told Premier Sports:\n\n\"I thought we started the game really well with great intent. We had a lot of opportunities but we didn't quite take them.\n\n\"You have to give the lads a huge amount of credit, it was an unbelievably composed dressing room at half-time.\n\n\"It's difficult to play here. Leicester are incredibly dogged in everything they do.\n\n\"I thought we showed good composure to come away with a win, because it wasn't perfect, but the lads managed to find a way to get the scores at important times of the game.\"\n\nBoth sides will play their final two pool matches in January. Leicester face Bayonne at home and Stormers away, while Leinster host La Rochelle before visiting Bayonne.\n\nThe Tigers' next game is a home Prem fixture against Gloucester on Friday, 19 December - the same day on which Leinster return to URC action at home to Ulster.\n\nLeicester: Steward; Radwan, Wand, Kata, Hassell-Collins; Searle, Whiteley; Smith, Blamire, Heyes, Henderson, Wells, Thompson, Reffell (capt), Moro.\n\nReplacements: Theobald-Thomas, Van der Flier, Hurd, Manz, Williams, Allan, Bailey, Woodward.\n\nLeinster: J O'Brien; T O'Brien, Ioane, Henshaw, Lowe; Byrne, Gibson-Park; McCarthy, Kelleher, Clarkson, McCarthy, Ryan, Conan, Van der Flier, Doris.\n\nReplacements: Sheehan, Boyle, Slimani, Mangan, Deegan, McGrath, Prendergast, Frawley.\n\nReferee: Pierre Brousset (France)\n\nAssistant referees: Vincent Blasco Baque (France) and Julien Caulier (France)",

    "fullText": "DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.\n\nAdm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami.\n\nIn farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.\n\n“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.\n\nHolsey’s shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration’s strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.\n\nLong-term replacement for Holsey hasn't yet been named\n\nThe ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey’s replacement.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.\n\n“It’s never been about you, it’s been about people, it’s been about others,” Caine said. “You’ve never said ‘I’ in all the conversations we’ve had. You’ve always said ‘we.’ … The impact you’ve had will last for a long time.”\n\nHolsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHolsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators’ questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.\n\nExperts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.\n\nThe 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro’s grip on power.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nHolsey’s departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military’s top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.\n\nA native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”\n\nPettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey’s top deputy since late 2024. However, it’s unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.",

    "description": "“She owns two houses and lives with a disabled son.”",
    "fullText": "Can you work a minimum wage job and retire with $2 million?\n\nA gentleman reader asks this question: “We read news about some people making six-figure incomes while living paycheck to paycheck. My Taiwanese friend moved here, couldn’t read or write English, married an American GI, moved to Texas, worked at Walmart for minimum wage — worked for almost 60 years — and retired a few years ago only because her husband got sick. At 87, her stock portfolio is about $2 million. She owns two houses and lives with a disabled son. Her husband also had mental-health issues, so she couldn’t rely on him.” It’s possible she did this with seed money from her husband and, yes, it’s possible that she did this without it.\n\n‘This feels like an opportunity’: I’m 55, earn $78,000 and have no kids. My mother gave me $10,000. What should I do?\n\nMy Taiwanese immigrant friend started working in Walmart for minimum wage and retired with $2 million. What was her secret?\n\nInvestors fear Time just jinxed the AI stock-market rally with its 2025 person of the year\n\nThere are a few weeks left to supersize your Roth conversion without raising your tax bill\n\nLiving paycheck to paycheck means different things for different people. For someone earning $100,000 or $200,000 a year who is living paycheck to paycheck, they are probably balancing their books (tightly) every month because they are also contributing 6% of their salary to their 401(k) or IRA; 30% on mortgage payments (rather than rent) so they will benefit from the increase in value of their property over the lifetime of the mortgage); and thousands of dollars into their children’s tax-advantaged college 529 plans — in addition to the monthly food, transport, vacation, leisure, gym and utilities expenses.\n\nAs Americans try to navigate (or wait) their way out of the current “affordability crisis,” six-figure earners are making up for a much larger share of consumer spending. In fact, the top 10% of earners — those households making about $250,000 a year or more — have made huge gains in recent years because of the prolonged bull market and increases in their real estate and other assets. They account for nearly 50% of all spending, up from 36% three decades ago, according to Moody’s Analytics data published by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHis Taiwanese friend, given what he says about her early years and the fact that she could not rely on her husband to boost her financial security, could have been one Walmart WMT pink slip away from being on the street, if she did not have a wealthy family as a social safety net. What’s more, she may also have been sending money home to her own family of origin. This is the stuff that the American Dream is made of, but first-generation immigrants also have language barriers that can restrict their work-life prospects.",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "description": "A tomb beneath Petra’s Treasury reveals 12 skeletons and 2,000-year-old artifacts. Archaeologists call it a rare find, unlocking secrets of the Nabataeans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new tomb was discovered at Petra’s Khazneh, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nThe tomb’s discovery, as revealed on Discovery Channel’s “Expedition Unknown,” also included 12 skeletons from over 2,000 years ago.\n\nIn addition to being a true archaeological marvel, the ornate facade of Jordan’s ancient city of Petra has served as a backdrop in a number of movies, including “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”\n\nThe sandstone cliff faces of the ancient city of Petra (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World) have long been in the archaeological limelight. They’ve even spent time in the Hollywood limelight as the location for several scenes in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But in a recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford’s iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery.\n\nDiscovery Channel’s popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. The colossal find was accomplished by a team lead by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman.\n\nIt’s a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of.\n\n“This is a hugely rare discovery,” said Josh Gates, host of the Discovery Channel’s program, according to CNN. “In the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.”\n\nCreasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. The gathered data matched up to data collected from areas where tombs had been found in the past, and the Jordan government gave the approval for excavation beneath the world-famous site.\n\nThe team was beyond pleased to see an actual tomb materialize, and truly shocked by the fact that it was full of remains and artifacts—many of the tombs at the ancient city have been found empty, picked clean long ago.\n\nAlong with the 12 sets of skeletal remains—several of the bones from which had mold, thanks to the porous sandstone allowing moisture into the space in the flood-prone area—the team found a mix of bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This included one ceramic chalice tucked in the arms of one of the deceased, ironically reminiscent of the “Holy Grail” depicted in The Last Crusade. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.”\n\nThe Treasury, located near the main entrance to the city, is believed to be at least 2,000 years old. It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs.\n\n“We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven’t been rummaged around and moved, so that’s exceedingly rare.”\n\nDelving deeper into the remains and artifacts found in the tomb could open additional information about the Khazneh, Petra, and the lives of the Nabataeans who once inhabited the area. “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director, a federal judge said Friday.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly represents not only a stern rebuke of the conduct of Justice Department prosecutors but also imposes a dramatic hurdle to government efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey after an initial one was dismissed last month.\n\nThe order concerns computer files and communications that investigators obtained years earlier from Daniel Richman, a Comey friend and Columbia University law professor, as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges. The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.\n\nRichman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.\n\n“When the Government violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person’s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government’s unlawful intrusion?” the judge wrote.\n\nOne answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation has been based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Comey used Richman to share information with the news media about his decision-making during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.\n\nThat indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Comey saga has a long history.\n\nIn June 2017, one month after Comey was fired as FBI director, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.\n\nAfter that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer. He authorized the FBI to conduct a search for limited purposes, the judge noted.\n\nThen, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded in 2021 without charges. Those warrants were limited in scope, but Richman has alleged that the government collected more information than the warrants allowed, including personal medial information and sensitive correspondence.\n\nIn addition, Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.\n\n“The Court further concludes that the Government’s retention of Petitioner Richman’s files amounts to an ongoing unreasonable seizure,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “Therefore, the Court agrees with Petitioner Richman that the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",

    "fullText": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — In the age of dinosaurs — before whales, great whites or the bus-sized megalodon — a monstrous shark prowled the waters off what's now northern Australia, among the sea monsters of the Cretaceous period.\n\nResearchers studying huge vertebrae discovered on a beach near the city of Darwin say the creature is now the earliest known mega-predator of the modern shark lineage, living 15 million years earlier than enormous sharks found before.\n\nAnd it was huge. The ancestor of today’s 6-meter (20-foot) great white shark was thought to be about 8 meters (26 feet) long, the authors of a paper published in the journal Communications Biology said.\n\n“Cardabiodontids were ancient, mega-predatory sharks that are very, very common from the later part of the Cretaceous, after 100 million years ago,” said Benjamin Kear, the senior curator in paleobiology at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and one of the study’s authors. “But this has pushed the time envelope back of when we’re going to find absolutely enormous cardabiodontids.”\n\nRediscovered fossils pointed to a huge shark\n\nSharks have a 400-million-year history but lamniforms, the ancestors of today’s great white sharks, appear in the fossil record from 135 million years ago. At that time they were small — probably only a meter in length — which made the discovery that lamniforms had already become gigantic by 115 million years ago an unexpected one for researchers.\n\nThe vertebrae were found on coastline near Darwin in Australia’s far north, once mud from the floor of an ancient ocean that stretched from Gondwana — now Australia — to Laurasia, which is now Europe. It’s a region rich in fossil evidence of prehistoric marine life, with long-necked plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs among the creatures discovered so far.\n\nThe five vertebrae that launched the quest to estimate the size of their mega-shark owners were not a recent discovery, but an older one that had been somewhat overlooked, Kear said. Unearthed in the late 1980s and 1990s, the fossils measured 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) across and had been stored in a museum for years.\n\nWhen studying ancient sharks, vertebrae are prizes for paleontologists. Shark skeletons are made of cartilage, not bone, and their fossil record is mostly made up of teeth, which sharks shed throughout their lives.\n\n“The importance of vertebrae is they give us hints about size,” Kear said. “If you’re trying to scale it from teeth, it’s difficult. Are the teeth big and the bodies small? Are they big teeth with big bodies?”\n\nAncient shark size still holds mystery\n\nScientists have used mathematical formulas to estimate the size of extinct sharks like megalodon, a massive predator that came later and may have reached 17 meters (56 feet) in length, Kear said. But the rarity of vertebrae mean questions of ancient shark size are difficult to answer, he added.\n\nThe international research team spent years testing different ways to estimate the size of the Darwin cardabiodontids, using fisheries data, CT scans and mathematical models, Kear said. Eventually, they arrived at a likely portrait of the predator’s size and shape.\n\n“It would’ve looked for all the world like a modern, gigantic shark, because this is the beauty of it,” Kear said. “This is a body model that has worked for 115 million years, like an evolutionary success story.”\n\nA predator’s past could hint at the future\n\nThe study of the Darwin sharks suggested that modern sharks rose early in their adaptive evolution to the top of prehistoric food chains, the researchers said. Now, scientists could scour similar environments worldwide for others, Kear said.\n\n“They must have been around before,” he said. “This thing had ancestors.”\n\nStudying ancient ecosystems like this one could help researchers understand how today’s species might respond to environmental change, Kear added.\n\n“This is where our modern world begins,” he said. “By looking at what happened during past shifts in climate and biodiversity, we can get a better sense of what might come next.”",

    "fullText": "When you're shopping for a car, that new car smell and shiny paint job can make any vehicle seem like a winner. But the real test comes years down the road when you're wondering whether you'll make it to work or spend the morning waiting for a tow truck.\n\nConsumer Reports recently released findings from their extensive reliability study, surveying owners of vehicles between 5 and 10 years old to see which brands still have owners smiling and which ones have them speed-dialing their mechanic. The results reveal some expected champions, a few surprises, and some brands that might make you think twice before signing on the dotted line.\n\nIt's time to look into which automakers are building cars that go the distance and which ones might leave you stranded.\n\nThese are the car brands at the top of the list, starting with some pretty familiar faces in the \"reliability\" discussion. However, the last one is a bit of a shocker.\n\nLexus takes the crown as the most reliable brand in the entire study, and honestly, is anyone surprised? Toyota's luxury division has been dominating reliability rankings for so long that it's almost boring at this point.\n\nOwners of 5 to 10-year-old Lexus vehicles report fewer problems than any other brand, which explains why you still see older ES and RX models cruising around like they just rolled off the showroom floor. The brand's obsessive attention to detail and conservative engineering approach means you're more likely to get tired of your Lexus than it is to get tired of running.\n\nIf reliability is your top priority and you can stretch your budget to the luxury segment, Lexus remains the gold standard.\n\nRight behind its luxury sibling sits Toyota, proving that reliability runs in the family. The Japanese automaker has built its entire reputation on making vehicles that simply refuse to quit, and the data from owners backs that up year after year.\n\nModels like the Camry, Corolla, and RAV4 have become synonymous with worry-free ownership, racking up hundreds of thousands of miles without breaking a sweat. Toyota's approach to introducing new technology slowly and testing everything thoroughly might not win style points with the cutting-edge crowd, but it certainly wins the long game.\n\nWhen you buy a Toyota, you're essentially purchasing peace of mind wrapped in sheet metal.\n\nMazda often flies under the radar in reliability discussions, but owners of 5 to 10-year-old Mazdas know something that deserves more attention. The brand manages to deliver engaging driving dynamics without sacrificing dependability, which is a rare combination in today's market.\n\nWhile other manufacturers chase flashy technology and complicated powertrains, Mazda sticks to well-engineered fundamentals that actually work for the long haul. Their Skyactiv engines and transmissions have proven themselves as workhorses that keep running with minimal drama.\n\nIf you want a car that's fun to drive and won't leave you stranded, Mazda deserves serious consideration.\n\nHonda has been America's reliable best friend for decades, and the feedback from owners of older vehicles shows that reputation is well-earned. The Civic and Accord have become automotive institutions precisely because they deliver year after year without requiring a second mortgage to maintain.\n\nHonda's engineering philosophy focuses on efficiency and durability, creating powertrains that are known for running smoothly well past 200,000 miles. While the brand has stumbled occasionally with transmission issues in certain model years, the overall picture remains strong.\n\nFor practical transportation that won't let you down, Honda continues to be one of the safest bets in the automotive world.\n\nAcura proves that Honda's reliability DNA translates beautifully to the premium segment, landing solidly in the top tier for long-term dependability. Owners of 5 to 10-year-old Acura models enjoy many of the luxury features found in pricier European brands without the headache-inducing repair costs.\n\nThe MDX and TLX offer refined driving experiences backed by Honda's legendary engineering, creating a sweet spot for buyers who want more upscale transportation without sacrificing peace of mind. While Acura might not carry the prestige badge of some German rivals, your wallet will thank you when that check engine light stays off.\n\nSometimes the smartest luxury choice is the one that doesn't require your mechanic's kids to go to college on your dime.\n\nBMW landing in the top six for long-term reliability might raise some eyebrows, especially given the brand's reputation for expensive maintenance. However, owners of 5 to 10-year-old BMW models report better-than-expected experiences, suggesting the brand has made genuine improvements in dependability.\n\nThe German automaker has worked hard to address some of the reliability issues that plagued earlier generations, and the data shows those efforts are paying off. That said, owning an older BMW still requires a commitment to proper maintenance and a budget for premium parts.\n\nIf you're prepared for higher ownership costs and follow the maintenance schedule religiously, a BMW can deliver the driving excitement it promises without completely draining your bank account.\n\nThese are the automakers that landed on the bottom of the list, which had 26 total brands. While some are head scratchers, the last two are probably the usual suspects you expected to see.\n\nKia has made impressive strides in design and features over the past decade, but according to owners of 5 to 10-year-old vehicles, reliability remains a challenge for the Korean brand. While Kia offers compelling value and generous warranties, the feedback suggests that some models struggle to maintain their initial quality as the miles add up.\n\nThe brand's rapid expansion and introduction of new technology may have contributed to reliability issues that become apparent only after years of ownership. Kia's newer models may fare better as the company continues to refine its engineering, but buyers of older used Kias should budget for potential repairs.\n\nThe 10-year warranty is great, but it only helps if you're the original owner.\n\nGMC positions itself as the premium truck and SUV brand within General Motors, but owners of 5 to 10-year-old GMC vehicles report more issues than you'd expect from vehicles in this price range. The brand shares many components with Chevrolet, yet somehow manages to land lower in reliability rankings, which raises questions about value proposition.\n\nCommon complaints from owners include transmission issues, electrical problems, and various engine-related concerns that can be expensive to address. GMC builds capable trucks and SUVs with impressive towing capacity, but the reliability data suggests you might be visiting your dealer's service department more often than you'd like.\n\nFor buyers considering a used GMC, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is essential.\n\nChrysler's position near the bottom of reliability rankings reflects ongoing struggles that have plagued the brand for years. Owners of 5 to 10-year-old Chrysler vehicles report a range of issues from transmission problems to electrical gremlins that seem to pop up with frustrating regularity.\n\nThe brand's limited lineup means that reliability problems in one or two models have an outsized impact on the overall perception. While Chrysler vehicles often start strong with attractive styling and comfortable interiors, the long-term ownership experience hasn't matched that initial appeal.\n\nFor buyers shopping used Chryslers, the lower purchase prices might seem tempting, but factoring in potential repair costs is crucial for making an informed decision.\n\nRam has carved out a strong reputation for building trucks with excellent ride quality and impressive interiors, but reliability data from owners of 5 to 10-year-old models tells a concerning story. Issues ranging from electrical problems to powertrain concerns appear more frequently than truck buyers would hope for from vehicles designed for hard work.\n\nThe Ram 1500 has won numerous awards for its innovations and comfort, yet these accolades don't always translate into worry-free ownership down the road. Ram trucks can certainly handle demanding tasks, but owners should be prepared for more frequent service appointments than they might experience with some competitors.\n\nIf you're considering a used Ram, finding one with detailed maintenance records becomes especially important.\n\nJeep vehicles are built to handle off-road adventures and challenging terrain, but according to owners of 5 to 10-year-old models, they sometimes struggle with everyday reliability. The brand's focus on capability and ruggedness hasn't always translated into dependable long-term ownership, with various models reporting issues from electrical problems to engine concerns.\n\nJeep's popularity means there's a large community of owners willing to overlook reliability quirks for the brand's unique character and capability. However, buyers should go in with eyes open, knowing that keeping an older Jeep running might require more patience and money than mainstream alternatives.\n\nThe Jeep wave is fun, but the wave goodbye to your paycheck at the repair shop is less enjoyable.\n\nTesla lands at the very bottom of the reliability rankings, which might surprise fans of the electric vehicle pioneer but doesn't shock those who've followed owner feedback over the years. While Tesla has revolutionized the automotive industry with cutting-edge technology and impressive performance, owners of 5 to 10-year-old models report the most problems of any brand in the study.\n\nIssues range from build quality concerns to problems with complex electrical systems and the various tech features that make Teslas unique. The company's rapid innovation and direct-to-consumer model mean that some traditional quality control processes may get bypassed in the rush to market.\n\nTesla builds exciting vehicles that point toward the automotive future, but the current reality involves more service appointments than many owners anticipated.\n\nThe reliability gap between the best and worst performers in this Consumer Reports study reveals just how much brand choice matters for long-term satisfaction. Japanese brands continue to dominate the reliability conversation, with Lexus and Toyota leading the way through proven engineering and meticulous quality control.\n\nMeanwhile, several American brands struggle with the fundamentals, suggesting that flashy features and bold marketing don't automatically translate into dependable transportation. The data from real owners of 5 to 10-year-old vehicles provides valuable insight that goes beyond initial reviews and first impressions.\n\nWhether you're shopping for a new car or considering a used vehicle, understanding these reliability trends can save you thousands of dollars and countless headaches down the road.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nWorking Americans will soon see a sizable financial boost — all thanks to changes tied to President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nSpeaking with a reporter in Pennsylvania on Dec. 10, Bessent said an estimated $100 billion to $150 billion in tax refunds could hit bank accounts in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nBessent said that Trump has fought harder than anyone for his signature initiatives in the One Big Beautiful Bill, pointing to provisions such as no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and auto deductibility (1).\n\n“The bill was passed in July. Working Americans didn’t change their withholding, so they’re going to be getting very large refunds in the first quarter. So I think we’re going to see $100 to $150 billion of refunds, which could be between $1,000 and $2,000 per household.”\n\nAfter that, once withholding levels adjust, workers could see what he described as a “real increase” in their wages.\n\nThe White House echoed that outlook. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the upcoming refund season is projected to be the largest on record.\n\n“Americans can also expect another boost to their bank accounts in the months ahead as 2026 tax refund season is upon us after the holidays and it's projected to be the largest ever,” Leavitt said during a Dec. 11 press briefing (2).\n\nFor many households, that raises an immediate question: What’s the smartest way to use a sudden cash infusion? Whether you’re thinking about shoring up your finances, preparing for uncertainty, or putting that extra money to work, here are a few ways Americans may consider investing their potential windfall.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has been a powerful engine of wealth creation. Trump has pointed to that strength, recently saying, “the only thing that’s really going up big? It’s the stock market and your 401(k)s (3).”\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 is up about 16% year to date and has gained roughly 86% over the past five years.\n\nOf course, consistently picking winning stocks isn’t easy. That’s why legendary investor Warren Buffett argues that most people don’t need to pick individual companies at all to benefit from the stock market’s long-term growth.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday indefinitely froze Russia’s assets in Europe to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.\n\nUsing a special procedure meant for economic emergencies, the EU blocked the assets until Russia gives up its war on Ukraine and compensates its neighbor for the heavy damage that it has inflicted for almost four years.\n\nEU Council President António Costa said European leaders had committed in October “to keep Russian assets immobilized until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused. Today we delivered on that commitment.”\n\nIt’s a key step that will allow EU leaders to work out at a summit next week how to use the tens of billions of euros in Russian Central Bank assets to underwrite a huge loan to help Ukraine meet its financial and military needs over the next two years.\n\n“Next step: securing Ukraine’s financial needs for 2026–27,” added Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit.\n\nThe move also prevents the assets, estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion), from being used in any negotiations to end the war without European approval.\n\nA 28-point plan drafted by U.S. and Russian envoys stipulated that the EU would release the frozen assets for use by Ukraine, Russia and the United States. That plan, which surfaced last month, was rejected by Ukraine and its backers in Europe.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the EU decision means that “no one will decide in place of the Europeans the use of these funds.”\n\nThe vast majority of the funds — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.\n\nThe money was frozen under sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over the war it launched on Feb. 24, 2022, but these sanctions must be renewed every six months with the approval of all 27 member countries.\n\nHungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine, but Friday’s decision prevents them from blocking the sanctions rollover and make it easier to use the assets.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe – said on social media that it means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”\n\n“The European Commission is systematically raping European law. It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote. He said that Hungary “will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order.”\n\nIn a letter to Costa, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that he would refuse to back any move that “would include covering Ukraine’s military expenses for the coming years.”\n\nHe warned “that the use of frozen Russian assets could directly jeopardize U.S. peace efforts, which directly count on the use of these resources for the reconstruction of Ukraine.”\n\nBut the commission argues that the war has imposed heavy costs by hiking energy prices and stunting economic growth in the EU, which has already provided nearly 200 billion euros ($235 billion) in support to Ukraine.\n\nBelgium, where Euroclear is based, is opposed to the “reparations loan” plan. It says that the plan “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,” and has called on other EU countries to share the risk.\n\nRussia’s Central Bank, meanwhile, said on Friday that it has filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it says were caused when Moscow was barred from managing the assets. Euroclear declined to comment.\n\nThe Belgian clearing house has around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in Russia and it’s unclear what would happen to that money if the legal challenge or others like it succeed.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Central Bank also described wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine as “illegal, contrary to international law,” arguing that they violated “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets.”\n\nBut EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis brushed off the suit, saying that the decision is “legally robust,” and that he expects Russia “to continue to launch speculative legal proceedings to prevent the EU from upholding international law.”\n\nChris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. Consultancy, said that the timing of the court action is “clearly linked” to the EU’s intention to use the frozen assets.\n\n“The Russian Central Bank is making clear that it will respond with legal actions against all countries involved in the decision to take the Russian money,” he said.\n\nFriday's EU decision came hours after Germany summoned the Russian ambassador in Berlin following allegations of sabotage, disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and interference in its elections.",

    "description": "A thick layer of more than 12 miles of rock may explain why Bermuda seems to float above the surrounding ocean.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMove aside, Bermuda Triangle: The newest North Atlantic mystery lies beneath this enigmatic archipelago. Scientists have discovered a strange, 12.4-mile-thick (20 kilometers) rock layer below the oceanic crust under Bermuda. This level of thickness has never been seen in any other similar layer worldwide.\n\n\"Typically, you have the bottom of the oceanic crust and then it would be expected to be the mantle,\" said study lead author William Frazer, a seismologist at Carnegie Science in Washington D.C. \"But in Bermuda, there is this other layer that is emplaced beneath the crust, within the tectonic plate that Bermuda sits on.\"\n\nWhile the origin of this layer is not entirely clear, it may explain an ongoing mystery about Bermuda, Frazer told Live Science. The island sits on an oceanic swell, where the ocean crust is higher than its surroundings. But there is no evidence of any ongoing volcanic activity creating that swell — the island's last known volcanic eruption was 31 million years ago.\n\nThe discovery of the new giant \"structure\" suggests the last eruption may have injected mantle rock into the crust, where it froze in place, creating something like a raft that raises the ocean floor by about 1,640 feet (500 meters).\n\nBermuda has long had a reputation for mystery, largely because of the Bermuda Triangle, an area between the archipelago, Florida and Puerto Rico where a supposedly unusual number of ships and aircraft have gone missing. (This reputation, however, has been largely exaggerated.) The real mystery, though, is why the Bermuda oceanic swell exists.\n\nIsland chains such as Hawaii are thought to exist because of mantle hotspots, which are places in the mantle where hot material rises, creating volcanic activity. At the point where the hotspot meets the crust, the ocean floor often buoys up. But when tectonic movement slides the crust away from that hotspot, the oceanic swell typically subsides.\n\nBermuda's swell hasn't subsided, despite 31 million years of volcanic inactivity there, Frazer said. There is some debate over what's happening in the mantle beneath the island, but there are no eruptions happening at the surface.\n\nFrazer and study co-author Jeffrey Park, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, used recordings from a seismic station on Bermuda of distant large earthquakes around the world to get an image of Earth down to about 31 miles (50 km) below Bermuda. They examined places where the seismic waves from these quakes suddenly changed. This revealed the unusually thick layer of rock, which is less dense than the other rock around it.\n\nTheir findings were published Nov. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n\n\"There is still this material that is left over from the days of active volcanism under Bermuda that is helping to potentially hold it up as this area of high relief in the Atlantic Ocean,\" Sarah Mazza, a geologist at Smith College in Massachusetts who was not involved in the work, told Live Science.\n\nMazza's own research into Bermuda's volcanic history found that the types of lavas there are low in the mineral silica, which is a sign that they come from rock high in carbon. Mazza's examination of variations in zinc molecules in samples from Bermuda, published in September in the journal Geology, found that this carbon comes from deep in the mantle. It was likely first pushed there when the supercontinent Pangea formed between 900 million and 300 million years ago, Mazza said. This is different from what is seen at hotspot-formed islands in the Pacific or Indian oceans, she added. This difference may be because the Atlantic, which opened up when Pangea split apart, is a young ocean compared to the Pacific or Indian oceans, which were at Pangea's edges.\n\n—Scientists find hidden 'hotspot' that helped create the Great Lakes before North America even existed\n\n— Mysterious 'blobs' in Earth's mantle are not what we thought, study claims\n\n— Extreme 'paradise' volcano in Costa Rica is like a piece of ancient Mars on our doorstep\n\n\"The fact that we are in an area that was previously the heart of the last supercontinent is, I think, part of the story of why this is unique,\" she said.\n\nFrazer is now examining other islands around the world to find out if there are any similar layers to the one found under Bermuda, or whether the archipelago is truly one of a kind.\n\n\"Understanding a place like Bermuda, which is an extreme location, is important to understand places that are less extreme,\" Frazer said, \"and gives us a sense of what are the more normal processes that happen on Earth and what are the more extreme processes that happen.\"",

    "fullText": "The alleged Charlie Kirk shooter, Tyler Robinson, appeared calm during his first in-person court hearing. However, lip-reading suggests he reflected darkly on the shooting and even referenced Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk.\n\nThe 22-year-old is said to have described his mental struggles behind bars, saying that he thinks about the shooting \"every day.\"\n\nTyler Robinson faces multiple severe charges, including aggravated murder. He surrendered after a search and allegedly confessed to the shooting of Charlie Kirk in messages to his roommate.\n\nRobinson, the 22-year-old accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, appeared in court Thursday and was caught in an unsettling off-mic exchange in which he seemingly reflected on the fatal shooting.\n\nDuring his first in-person court appearance in Provo, Utah, Robinson appeared calm, even sharing brief laughs and smiles with his attorney. But, according to a lip-reading analysis by Lip Reader Limited, his private comments were far darker.\n\n\"I think about the shooting daily,\" Robinson appeared to tell his lawyer before the hearing began. \"Every morning … all the time.\"\n\nAccording to the lip reader, he then seemed to reference Erika Kirk, who is now raising the couple's two young children alone.\n\n\"So, he had a wife…,\" the suspected shooter said at the moment. Robinson also allegedly talked about his mental state behind bars, saying he has been \"smoking a lot\" and struggling with sleepless nights.\n\n\"It's driving me mental,\" he appeared to add, per the New York Post. \"I'm not good for anything.\"\n\n🚨BREAKING: Accused Killer of Charile Kirk appears in person for the FIRST TIME since turning himself in.\n\nIt's absolutely infuriating.

They told us that there was video footage from a local fast-food restaurant. They were very, very almost oversharing in the beginning.\"\n\nHe added: \"Now they've shut that tap off, and they're saying you can't even come to court and hear about what we're doing when most of it's probably procedural.\"\n\nRobinson surrendered to authorities after a statewide search. According to court documents, his parents recognized him from surveillance images released by police and convinced him to turn himself in.\n\nThe next day, Robinson, his parents, and a family friend arrived at the Washington County Sheriff's Office, where he was taken into custody.\n\nInvestigators say Robinson also confessed in messages to his roommate and romantic partner, described in documents as \"a biological male who was transitioning genders.\"\n\nAs reported by The Blast, in those texts, he allegedly wrote, \"I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out,\" hinting at what many believe was his motive.\n\nRobinson's mother told detectives her son had grown \"more political\" and increasingly \"pro-gay and trans-rights oriented\" over the past year.\n\nAs for Robinson's roommate and alleged trans partner, Lance Twiggs, their whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nTwiggs faced heavy scrutiny in the wake of the killing of the right-wing influencer after it was reported that Robinson had messaged him about his actions and motive.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, the 22-year-old has initially cooperated with authorities; however, it's unclear if that still remains the case given his current AWOL status.\n\nTwiggs has also not publicly said a word about the murder of Kirk and has not addressed the media since the shooting incident rocked the world.",

    "fullText": "Diamond Aircraft has officially delivered the first newly produced European-built DA20i Katana since restarting production of the line earlier this year. The aircraft was handed over to Aviation Academy Austria (AAA) during a ceremony at Diamond's headquarters in Wiener Neustadt on November 28.\n\nThis delivery marks a significant step for the Austrian manufacturer, which announced in October that it was resuming European production of the two-seat trainer after a hiatus of more than a decade. While the DA20-C1 has remained in continuous production at Diamond's Canadian facility for the North American market, the European return was driven by renewed demand from flight schools and private owners across the continent seeking a modern, fuel-efficient primary trainer.\n\nThe newly delivered aircraft is the first of two DA20i Katanas AAA ordered, with the second scheduled to arrive in early 2026. The academy, a longtime operator of Diamond aircraft, already maintains a fleet that includes seven older DA20i models, four DA40 NGs, and two DA42 NG-VI twins.\n\n\"We are thrilled to welcome the new DA20i Katana into our fleet,\" said Oliver Karall, CEO of Aviation Academy Austria. \"This aircraft perfectly aligns with our mission to provide state-of-the-art training solutions. Its combination of proven design and cutting-edge technology will allow our students to experience the very best in modern flight training.\"\n\nThe revitalized European DA20i distinguishes itself from its predecessors through significant avionics and powerplant upgrades. The new model is powered by the Rotax 912 iSc3 Sport engine, a shift from the Continental IO-240-B32B found in its Canadian-built C1 counterpart.\n\nInside, the cockpit has been modernized with a Garmin G500 TXi glass flight deck, replacing legacy instrumentation to offer students a touchscreen interface that better prepares them for advanced avionics platforms.\n\n\"Relaunching production of the DA20i Katana-and now delivering the first unit in Europe-marks another exciting chapter for Diamond Aircraft and our customers,\" said Jane Wang, director of sales and marketing at Diamond Aircraft Austria. \"The DA20i blends tradition with innovation, making it an ideal choice for flight schools like AAA that are committed to shaping the next generation of pilots.\"\n\nThe post Diamond Aircraft Hands Over First European-Built DA20 Since Restarting Production appeared first on Plane & Pilot.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nThe remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there.\n\nKupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.\n\nLess than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.\n\nMoscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine’s forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant.\n\nHe told Kommersant “it’s entirely possible that there won’t be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”\n\nFor months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.\n\nSince Moscow’s 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.\n\nUkraine says its constitution doesn’t allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.\n\nIn October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be \"cut up\" to end the war.\n\nIn recent months, Russia’s army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.\n\nIts slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.\n\nUkrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard’s Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.\n\nFighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.\n\nZelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.\n\n“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine’s Ground Forces Day.\n\nRussian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.\n\nUkraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.\n\nIts Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.\n\nThe ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.\n\nA Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.\n\nRussia’s air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.\n\nUkraine’s southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.\n\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.
