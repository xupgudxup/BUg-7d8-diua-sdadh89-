    "fullText": "Looking ahead to the January and summer transfer windows, there look to be two main positions that Manchester City will look to strengthen. It would not be a surprise to see City move for another winger or attacking player in January. Omar Marmoush will be unavailable for an extended period of time due to the African Cup of Nations. City could benefit from signing another attacking player next month. It would also seem that Pep Guardiola’s squad would benefit from signing a right-back. That move appears to be one that will likely take place in the summer and there is one player who is emerging as City’s main target for the right-back role.\n\nTwo new reports have emerged that state that Manchester City could move for Tino Livramento next summer. The first comes from Craig Hope for the Daily Mail. Hope reports that Tino Livramento is set to delay any decision on signing a contract extension with Newcastle United until near the end of this season. Furthermore, Hope reports that Livramento’s long-term future is uncertain. Hope further reports that Manchester City have a strong interest in signing the England international. Lastly, it is also reported that if Newcastle United qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League, Tino Livramento could sign a contract extension with Newcastle. Newcastle United are determined to keep Livramento at the club as per Craig Hope’s report.\n\nJordan Campbell has reported for The Athletic that Manchester City decided not to pursue a move for Tino Livramento last summer as they deemed a move for the England international as out of reach. Furthermore, Campbell reports that Tino Livramento is highly appreciated as a player at City. Campbell also reports that City could have to pay near enough to £100 million to sign Tino Livramento from Newcastle United if he doesn’t sign a contract extension with Eddie Howe’s side.\n\nAll indications are that Manchester City have identified Tino Livramento as the primary transfer target to come in at right-back. Matheus Nunes has done a superb job playing in the position this season. Nunes’ game has improved and there is no reason why he cannot remain as Manchester City’s first-choice right-back for this season. Abdukodir Khusanov can step in for Nunes when required. It would be almost impossible for City to sign Tino Livramento in January so the England international would look to be a summer target for City.\n\nBased on Craig Hope and Jordan Campbell’s reports it seems to now be a matter of when City will make their move to sign Tino Livramento from Newcastle, not if they will make that particular move. There is now too much noise to suggest otherwise. Livramento would almost be the ideal signing for City. He is a homegrown player blessed with tremendous technical ability and he is a tremendous defender at either left or right-back. He is also the ideal age to arrive at City as an established player with his best years ahead of him. Livramento ticks every box required of a potential Manchester City signing.\n\nAs of right now, unless Livramento extends his contract with Newcastle, it seems that City will move to sign Tino Livramento. It will likely be a move that Manchester City will pursue next summer. Whether or not that move will be successful remains to be seen. But it would appear that City have identified their top target to sign for the right-back position.",

    "fullText": "Detroit Catholic Central four-star wide receiver Samson Gash is one of the few unsigned blue-chippers left in the 2026 cycle.\n\nThe 6-foot pass-catcher has been committed to Michigan State since June 24, but he decided not to sign earlier this month as the Spartans had a change at head coach and elsewhere on the staff. The in-state program still holds his commitment, but other programs are in the mix, too.\n\nAnother notable offer came through for Gash on Friday. He took to social media to announce an offer from James Coley and the Georgia Bulldogs:\n\nBlessed to receive an offer from Georgia!!\n\n@CoachColey@KirbySmartUGA@DHill39@AllenTrieu@GregSmithRivals@SWiltfong_@adamgorneypic.twitter.com/cIFyIumAHB\n\nWR (@GashSamson) December 13, 2025\n\nWith UGA in the mix, it could throw another wrinkle in the recruitment of Gash, which has taken multiple turns this fall. Before the coaching change in East Lansing, Michigan State was already trying to fend off Alabama.\n\nThe Crimson Tide were in pursuit of Gash this fall and a flip looked to be probable, but the SEC program took its foot off the gas. After the firing of Michigan State head coach Jonathan Smith, Gash began to draw interest from West Virginia.\n\nAt the end of the National Signing Period last week, it looked the Mountaineers were in the driver’s seat. Earlier this week, though, Penn State and new head coach Matt Campbell jumped in with an offer. Gash’s father, Sam Gash, played for the Nittany Lions.\n\n“This offer means a lot to me. It’s been a long time coming,” Gash told BWI. “I’ve been up there a few times and I know the program is in great hands with this new Iowa State staff that I like and trust a lot after they were recruiting me a little bit at Iowa State.”\n\nGeorgia will now look to make its presence felt for Gash, who won’t put pen to paper until February. The Bulldogs lost four-star WR Brady Marchese during the signing period as he flipped to Michigan. They did still sign a pair of four-star wideouts last week in Craig Dandridge and Ryan Mosley.\n\nMichigan State, now led by Pat Fitzgerald, still signed 19 prospects last week. It would love to keep Gash in the mix, too, but it won’t be easy.\n\n“It feels really good knowing MSU is in good hands and is a safe option for me and great hire,” Gash told Rivals’ Greg Smith about the Fitzgerald hire.\n\nGash is the No. 292 overall prospect and No. 46 WR in the 2026 cycle, according to the Rivals Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all major recruiting media companies. He’s also the No. 6 recruit in Michigan.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMIAMI, Florida, Dec. 12 — The Northwestern [Miami, FL] Bulls roll into Florida's FHSAA Class 3A title Friday evening with a 23-game win streak and an undefeated 13-0 record as they look to defend their 2024 state championship at Florida International University's Pitbull Stadium.\n\nTheir opponent will look very familiar as they'll face the same Raines [Jacksonville, FL] Vikings' squad they beat, 41-0, in last year's title tilt. Raines also sports a 13-0 record headed into the contest.\n\nNorthwestern will be seeking its eight state championship in football while Raines is in the hunt for its fourth football state championship trophy.\n\nGame time is set for 7:30 p.m. EST local.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 22 Northwestern [Miami, FL] Bulls vs. Raines [Jacksonville, FL] Vikings\n\nThis Raines defense! I've been talking about them all night here, and they get an interception with a big return when Northwestern goes for it on fourth down. After trailing by nine, the Vikings are, amazingly, in business.\n\nWith 7:12 to play, Raines finally has some points from the offense, tacking on a field goal. It's important. It gets this back to a one-score game, and a touchdown and PAT could possibly win it.\n\nThis was never going to be easy for Raines, and it just got a lot harder as the Vikings' defense finally gives up its first touchdown. Northwestern back firmly in control in a two-score game now.\n\nWell, Raines has finally scored against Northwestern, but it's the only 7 points they have in seven quarters against this Northwestern team the past two years. But, the difference this year is their defense is keeping this thing close. And that defense might have to go and win this thing for them.\n\nNorthwestern shakes off the interception and drives down into position for another field goal. But these are still small victories for the Vikings. They're giving their offense every opportunity to go win this game.\n\nWell, the defense for Raines has been keeping them in this game, and now they've given the Vikings the lead on a long interception return. This is a crazy swing, and in seven quarters of play against Northwestern, this is the first points Raines has managed. But this is no anomaly; this is the Viking's 12th defensive touchdown this year.\n\nNorthwestern adds another field goal, but Raines' defense is playing tough tonight. They're giving the offense a chance if it can ever get on track.\n\nAnd the third quarter is just getting under way!\n\nThis is looking a lot better than last year, but one important number is the same so far – that goose egg on the Vikings' side of the scoreboard. They lost last year's game 41-0, and through two quarters tonight, the offense still hasn't cracked the code against this stout Bulls' defense.\n\nRaines was finally driving deep in Northwestern's territory, helped along by a pass interference penalty. But then they throw an interception near the 5 yard line with 39 seconds to play in the first half.\n\nKhavon Gipson with a clutch interception for Northwestern. Raines was driving. pic.twitter.com/WKTZkhHnnN\n\n— Adam Lichtenstein (@ABLichtenstein) December 13, 2025\n\nNorthwestern was about to score when the running back took a hard lick near the goal line. The ball rolled into the end zone where Raines recovered to take over. The Vikings' defense is bending but not breaking. But they need some help from the offense late in the second quarter.\n\nRaines was pinned deep in its own territory after the turnover on downs. They were forced to punt from their end zone, but Northwestern mishandles the punt, and Raines pounces on it. Northwestern would have had great field position around the Vikings' 30, but instead, the Vikings keep their drive alive.\n\nNorthwestern takes their second drive inside the Raines' 5. On fourth and goal, they go for the first down, but the Vikings' defense forces the turnover on downs!\n\nNorthwestern puts together a solid drive, but Raines' defense stands tall in the shadow of their own end zone to force a field goal.\n\nField goal! @mnw_fb scores first.

An interception return for a touchdown gives Grimsley its first two-score lead of the night.\n\nTwo early turnovers, one by each team, to start the third quarter.

A very solid effort tonight by Clayton against one of the top two senior quarterback in the entire national Class of 2026.\n\nAnd the third quarter is under way.\n\nWell, two second-quarter touchdowns have turned this game around. But Clayton is in this, and they've proven so far that they can make plays on both sides of the field.\n\nWith just 37 second to play in the first half, Grimsley finally takes its first lead of the night. Faizon Brandon making plays with his feet tonight, too.\n\nWell, it's been tough going for the defending state champions from Grimsley, but they finally get on the board as Faizon Brandon finds Hudson Cooper with a strike in the middle of the field near the goal line. Cooper falls into the end zone on the tackle, and they're back to even in Chapel Hill.\n\nSo far, the defending champs are having a tough go of it. They haven't been able to make plays against this Clayton defense, yet. A long way to go, but you have to be happy with that first 12 minutes if you're a Comets' fan.\n\nClayton jumps on the defending champs early.\n\nThey're under way in Chapel Hill, North Carolina!\n\nThe game between Clayton and Grimsley is being played at the University of North Carolina's Kenan Stadium.\n\nWATCH ON THE NFHS NETWORK:No. 20/SN No. 17 Grimsley [Greensboro, NC] Whirlies vs. Clayton [NC] Comets\n\nMORE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYOFF HEADLINES\n\nFlorida 2025 playoff brackets (7A/6A/5A/4A)\n\nGeorgia 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)\n\nLouisiana 2025 playoff brackets (Division I/II)\n\nTexas 2025 playoff brackets (6A/5A/4A)",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Midwest Athletic Conference produces some of the best small-school athletes at the high school level anywhere in Ohio.\n\nAs far as boys basketball goes, Cameron Elwer of Delphos St. John's now stands alone.\n\nOn Friday night, Elwer became the MAC's all-time leading scorer.\n\nHere's a look at the shot that did it:\n\n#ThatMomentWhen@elwer_cameron became the @midwestathletic all time leading scorer. pic.twitter.com/Jui7T1PC42\n\n— Michael Hirn (@MichaelHirnPBP) December 13, 2025\n\nElwer broke the record previously held by Versailles' Justin Ahrens, which had stood at 2,046 points.\n\nHe needed 30 on the night to break the mark. Elwer dropped 45.\n\nThe Blue Jays' senior star drilled 11 3-pointers in the process, a special night all around, as St. John's beat MAC rival Minster, 64-44.\n\nElwer entered this season with major expectations, playing on a roster filled with his brothers and cousins, a whole host of Elwers.\n\nThe leading Elwer is bound for Division I Furman after this season. First, he'll put together one final magical season showing the entire MAC what he can do, and hopefully, make a run that shows the rest of the state, too.\n\nElwer will have plenty of time to expand on his record, and he surely will along a path that includes a lot of winning, too.\n\nMORE: Cooper Flagg makes NBA history only done by LeBron, 'Melo and Wemby",

    "title": "Papermoon: A Space-Grade Linux for the NewSpace Era",
    "description": "Discover Papermoon, the open source project creating a standard, space-grade Linux to replace bespoke software for satellites and spacecraft in the NewSpace era.",
    "fullText": "TOKYO — When I worked for NASA in the 1980s, every satellite and spaceship that went into orbit ran one-off, hand-coded, semi-proprietary programs. This approach was painful, expensive, and sometimes disastrous, as with the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999 due to a software blunder.\n\nThings have changed. In his “Space Grade Linux” keynote at the Open Source Summit Japan conference, Ramón Roche, a longtime robotics developer and general manager of the Dronecode Foundation, told how Linux and open source software are becoming the default for every launch — replacing the bespoke, one-off programs of the past.\n\nThis change has been coming for a while. By 2013, the International Space Station (ISS) switched out its Windows laptops for Debian Linux machines for mission-critical work. Today, SpaceX’s workhorse rocket, Falcon 9, and its Dragon spacecraft both run Linux. Roche also noted that the first aircraft on another planet, the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars, flew with Linux. Heck, a developer recently managed to run open source Doomon, a European Space Agency (ESA) satellite.\n\nBut Roche stressed that one thing has been lacking. A common space Linux platform so that space companies can stop “competing on the plumbing” and start sharing core software infrastructure.\n\nThe economic backdrop is a classic space‑tech storyline: It’s cheaper than ever to access orbit, but software complexity and safety requirements keep rising.\n\n“You can launch a satellite for the cost of a nice car,” Roche said, noting that the cost per kilogram is “quickly approaching less than $100 per kilo to ship payload to space,” which in turn fuels a flywheel of more launches, more applications and even “data centers in space.”\n\nWhat doesn’t scale, he argued, is the way many missions are still engineered as bespoke, one‑off software stacks. “It’s 2025 right now, and we’re still in a phase like 1969,” where missions are one‑off and expensive. That model “was fine back when launches cost millions of dollars, he noted, “but no longer fits the economics of NewSpace.\n\nSpace’s harsh realities — radiation‑induced “single set events” that reboot systems without warning, communication delays “measured in minutes,” and the impossibility of “SSH there” to fix a broken satellite — are pushing developers toward robust, well-understood, community‑maintained open source instead of proprietary stacks.\n\nThe problem, as Roche sees it, is not whether Linux is the right base layer for autonomous systems, but how it is used.\n\nA survey of practitioners identified Yocto as the “clear winner” among embedded Linux distributions. However, we still have a fragmented landscape of teams “building their own version of Linux from scratch” with “no shared foundational layer,” Roche said.\n\n“Everyone agrees that Linux is the answer,” he said. “But nobody agrees on which Linux.”\n\nThat fragmentation looks familiar to Roche, who has spent more than a decade in the drone ecosystem around PX4 and related projects.\n\n“I was there in 2010 when the drone industry looked very similar. Everyone was building on their own stacks, nobody talking to anyone else,” he recalled, describing “years of complicated effort” and “every company reinventing the wheel, incompatible protocols” before the community decided to “stop competing on the plumbing and start competing on innovation.”\n\nIn his telling, that shift enabled open source to power “the majority of commercial and professional drones worldwide,” from agriculture and inspection to mapping, search‑and‑rescue, and even defense.\n\nThe answer is Papermoon, a proposed space‑grade Linux stack. Roche described it as “an open source project and a new foundation” built around Linux as the “autoplay, middle layer architecture,” licensed under MIT, with a Developer Certificate of Origin rather than contribution agreements “friction.”\n\nOn the hardware side, early targets include RISC‑V development boards “like a Raspberry Pi, same price point,” Roche said, alongside space‑designed platforms such as Microchip’s radiation‑tolerant MPSoC, with continuous integration already running “on every commit” and images booting on actual boards.\n\n“This is what you’re getting,” Roche told the audience, arguing that teams who adopt Papermoon are “not starting from zero”— the base layer, build system, and “safety‑aware configuration” represent “months that you don’t need to spend reinventing if you collaborate with us.”\n\nTo tackle safety and certification head-on, the project has been incubating inside the Linux Foundation’s Enabling Linux in Safety Applications (ELISA) initiative.  Roche highlighted ELISA vice president Kate Stewart’s work as emblematic of the community Papermoon wants to align with.\n\n“If you’re building safety‑critical systems that run on Linux, there’s no one better to learn from,” he said. “ELISA has been working on this problem since 2019: How do you use Linux in systems where failure means loss of life?”\n\nA year ago, about 30 people met in person at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) — my home base when I worked for NASA — with another 40 joining virtually from more than 20 organizations, agencies, and research groups, to “decide the direction for this project,” which Roche framed as “not a maintenance‑only conversation, that’s actual, real commitment.”\n\nThe next move, he said, is to “step out of the ELISA incubation and form our own foundation with neutral overheads, member‑driven, the same models that work for automotive grade Linux,” where founding members “help us shape what this becomes: the governance, the roadmap, and standards that we set.”\n\nRoche’s pitch to developers and companies in the room was blunt: Ingenuity “proved Linux belongs in space,” but “the next mission shouldn’t start from scratch.”\n\n“The question is, does every team after this rebuild from zero, or do we give them that foundation?” he asked, positioning Papermoon as that shared base and urging those “building for space” who recognize the pattern from drones and automotive to “come talk to us” and “help us build the foundation for the next era of space.”",

    "description": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Friday released never-before-seen images from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein",
    "fullText": "Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Friday released never-before-seen images from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some featuring powerbrokers like Bill Gates and Larry Summers.\n\nThe photos — which also feature President Donald Trump, ex-Trump advisor Steve Bannon, former President Bill Clinton, writer-director Woody Allen, Richard Branson, and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew — are a selection of the over 95,000 photos that the Democrats say were provided to the House Oversight Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nSome of the photos also include Ghislaine Maxwell, a onetime partner of Epstein who was convicted of trafficking girls to him for sex. She's currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.\n\nThe committee previously released other records obtained from Epstein's estate, including images of his US Virgin Islands home and tens of thousands of emails and text messages between Epstein and other powerful people.\n\nThe images themselves aren't indications of wrongdoing.\n\nIn many cases, it isn't clear when the photos were taken. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and agreed to register as a pedophile. In 2019, he killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on more severe sex-trafficking charges from federal prosecutors.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee's ranking member, Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California, said in a statement: \"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Gates, Summers, Bannon, Clinton, Allen, Branson, and Mountbatten-Windsor did not immediately respond to requests for comment by Business Insider.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Business Insider in a statement that House Democrats are once again \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"\n\nThe latest release of images comes as the Department of Justice readies to release a trove of Epstein-related documents. The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump, requires the Justice Department to make its files related to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell public by December 19.\n\n\"The Trump Administration has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends,\" Jackson said.\n\nBelow are some of the 19 images that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published on Friday:",

    "fullText": "It's not just grocery prices that are high — it's also the shopping baskets, or at least some of them.\n\nA Chanel handbag cosplaying as a grocery basket sold for $152,400 at auction on Thursday, breaking brand records.\n\nThe piece — the rare, runway silver and black lambskin leather shopping basket bag from 2014 — sold for more than 10 times its low estimate of $15,000 at the online auction from Christie's.\n\nThat's a lot of money, but far from the most expensive handbag ever sold.\n\nIn July, Hermès' original Birkin bag — worn by Jane Birkin, herself — sold for $10.1 million, becoming the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic purse went to a private collector in Japan, who phoned in and won a 10-minute bidding war.\n\nWhile items selling for millions, or even six figures, may be rare, the luxury resale market is booming.\n\nThe secondhand fashion and luxury market is expected to reach $317 billion by 2027, according to a McKinsey report published last month, and it's growing three times as fast as the firsthand market. Secondhand luxury retailers like The RealReal and Fashionphile have recorded double-digit revenue growth this year.\n\nMost luxury resale shoppers are turning to the market to find more affordable options, particularly as handbags from some of the biggest names have experienced significant price hikes over the past few years.\n\nChanel is one of the worst offenders. The price of its iconic flap bag nearly doubled between 2019 and 2024. This year, the brand increased prices again, hiking those of about 21% of its products by 5% in February, according to research from Citi. Add Trump's tariffs to the mix, and luxury handbags are more expensive than ever.\n\nThat said, it's not all deals on the secondhand market. Some savvy shoppers are treating luxury resale as an investment opportunity. Bags from Chanel sold for as much as 30% over their retail value on The RealReal last year.\n\nClassic handbags from brands like Louis Vuitton and Hermès tend to hold their value for years. Some of the most coveted handbags even sell for more on the secondhand market.",

    "description": "Almost a month after Prime Video launched AI-powered Video Recaps, viewers said it shared incorrect plot details about season one of \"Fallout.\"",
    "fullText": "Given the length of time it can take for the new season of your favorite TV show to come out, it's understandable that you might want a little video recap of what's happened so far.\n\nIdeally, that recap is accurate.\n\nFans of Amazon's hit show \"Fallout\" said that wasn't the case in its AI-made synopsis of season one, released ahead of the hit show's new season next week. Fans quickly spotted factual errors, and Amazon Prime Video took down the recap.\n\nOne Redditor said the AI feature told viewers that a flashback featuring the Ghoul (one of the main characters, played by Walton Goggins) took place in the 1950s instead of 2077.\n\nAn X user posted that the recap also mischaracterized the agreement the Ghoul and Lucy MacLean (played by Ella Purnell) made in the \"Fallout\" finale.\n\nInstead of saying the pair is teaming up to find Lucy's father, the recap said the Ghoul gave Lucy an ultimatum: \"die or join him.\"\n\nAmazon first launched its Video Recap, a feature that allows users to catch up on Prime Original TV shows between seasons, for beta testing in November.\n\n\"Video Recaps use AI to identify a show's most important plot points, combining them with synchronized voice narration, dialogue snippets, and music to create a visual summary that prepares viewers for the new season,\" the company said in a press release at the time.\n\nThe TV shows that Amazon said were undergoing Video Recaps testing — \"Jack Ryan,\" \"Upload,\" \"Bosch,\" and \"The Rig\" — did not include the feature at the time of writing.\n\nRepresentatives for Amazon did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nLike so many companies, Amazon is investing heavily in AI.\n\nDuring the company's February earnings call, Chief Finance Officer Brian Olsavsky said that 2025 capital expenditures could reach over $100 billion, with the majority of it going toward AI and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing platform.\n\nMany of Amazon's consumer services have integrated AI to enhance user engagement and experience, such as product suggestions and helping shoppers on its online platform find clothes that fit. In February, Amazon unveiled Alexa+, the next generation of Alexa, which is powered by generative AI to make it more conversational and personalized for users.\n\nEmbracing AI at Amazon, though, hasn't been without growing pains. In October, the company cited AI as it announced it would lay off 14,000 staff members.\n\n\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a blog post at the time.\n\nIn an internal message to the remaining staff, Amazon Vice President of Device Software and Services Tapas Roy asked them to \"lean in on AI.\"\n\n\"Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products,\" Roy wrote. \"In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes.\"",

    "description": "Disney staffers spoke about the company's OpenAI deal and AI strategy, including AI tools they are using and one in development codenamed \"Jarvis.\"",
    "fullText": "Disney's billion-dollar OpenAI deal isn't the only way the company is embracing AI. In recent months, the Mouse House has been quietly adding new AI tools to its arsenal and encouraging staff to use them.\n\n\"They clearly see where things are headed,\" a longtime software engineer at Disney said. This marked a shift from this summer, when Disney had seemed \"hesitant to rely on AI tools,\" they said.\n\nDisney has given its employees access to several AI tools, including Microsoft Copilot and Amazon's Q Developer. Thanks to Disney's OpenAI deal, employees will also soon have access to the enterprise version of ChatGPT, the company said.\n\nThen there's a \"DisneyGPT\" chatbot that four staffers said helps with internal requests, such as creating IT support tickets, viewing the company roster, or analyzing a project's financials.\n\nIn an email sent to staff on October 2, Disney introduced the beta version of the chatbot, describing it as a \"new partner in productivity\" designed to help \"unlock the magic of your imagination.\" A December update enabled employees to upload Excel and PowerPoint files to the bot.\n\nDisneyGPT draws on signature Disney themes, with a prompt asking users if they're \"ready for an enchanting adventure\" and \"a verified collection of Walt Disney quotes\" that are \"tagged by themes like imagination, perseverance, and leadership,\" according to the chatbot's December update log. Otherwise, employees said DisneyGPT is mostly a standard AI chatbot.\n\nThere's also an AI chatbot in the works codenamed \"Jarvis,\" four employees said. Jarvis, named for the personal assistant \"J.A.R.V.I.S.\" from \"Iron Man,\" would be an agentic AI tool — more advanced than DisneyGPT — that completes tasks on an employee's behalf, a high-level staffer with direct knowledge of the company's AI efforts said. This person said Jarvis is in its early stages and is \"not fully baked.\"\n\n\"It's definitely something they want to push for everyone to lean into more,\" a Disney manager said of AI.\n\nCompanies in every industry are racing to adopt AI tools to boost productivity. Disney is going further than many, however. The OpenAI deal makes Disney the first major entertainment company to invest in the AI juggernaut, and allows its beloved characters to be used in the video generator Sora.\n\nThis reflects Disney's long tradition of merging innovation and entertainment, dating back to its founder, Walt.\n\nThree of the eight Disney employees who spoke with Business Insider expressed concerns about using AI, specifically that it could replace humans and threaten job security.\n\nThe high-level employee with direct knowledge of Disney's AI strategy said that while AI is a \"top priority,\" it isn't a cure-all. It can make mistakes and lacks a \"personalized touch\" that people provide, they said.\n\n\"If you use AI everywhere, it's going to be counterproductive,\" this person said, adding that tasks still need human creativity.\n\nDisney spokespeople didn't respond to several requests for comment on its internal AI efforts.\n\nOn an internal Disney website explaining its AI policy and tools, the company said it employs a \"responsible and human-centric approach to using AI.\"\n\n\"That means humans are, and will remain, the creative engine of the company,\" Disney said on the site. \"We believe, fundamentally, that human creativity and curiosity are immense and unique — and are at the heart of Disney.\"\n\n\"Simultaneously, our consistent embrace of new technologies has been a key part of empowering our creators and maintaining our leadership in creativity and innovation,\" the company continued in its \"Responsible AI Use\" section.\n\nSeven of the eight Disney staffers Business Insider interviewed have tried or regularly use DisneyGPT or Copilot, which is integrated into employees' email accounts and documents. Many use those AI tools for simple, routine tasks, like writing emails.\n\nDisney has a portal on its website that outlines its AI policy and lists Disney-approved AI tools. Two employees said the company has pointed staffers to AI education or compliance training courses.\n\nSome unsanctioned AI tools like Anthropic's Claude can be more effective than Disney-approved AI tools, three staffers said.\n\nOne employee at Disney-owned ESPN said their manager told them they could use personal accounts on non-approved AI chatbots for work.\n\n\"I'm just using a personal account because Disney isn't allowing us to use these tools yet,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nThe staffer with direct knowledge of Disney's AI efforts said leadership had tried to make communications about AI \"clear across the board,\" but acknowledged that workers might not \"understand the implications\" of data security risks that could arise from using unsanctioned AI tools. Some staffers told Business Insider it was hard for them to keep up with the availability and restrictions on various AI tools.\n\nWhile some Disney employees expressed mixed feelings about AI, the more bullish among them said Disney was wise to strike a deal with OpenAI.\n\n\"This type of a partnership at least establishes the precedent for getting paid,\" the ESPN employee said.\n\nA Disney ads employee said they believed Disney's deal with OpenAI would \"pay off\" and \"be massive\" in five to 10 years, even if there are growing pains.\n\n\"Disney is smart to push into this,\" this staffer said. \"They are setting the rules of the game, or at least trying.\"",

    "description": "In the new Eras Tour docuseries, Taylor Swift distributes bonuses and handwritten letters to her dancers, musicians, and crew members.",
    "fullText": "Taylor Swift may be the biggest name in show business, but she's never one to miss a chance to thank the people who helped her succeed.\n\nSwift's new Disney+ docuseries, \"The End of an Era,\" features behind-the-scenes footage from the Eras Tour, which spanned 149 concerts in 21 countries. By the final show in December 2024, it had become the first tour in history to gross over $2 billion.\n\nIn the second episode of the docuseries, \"Magic in the Eras,\" Swift opens up about distributing bonuses to her dancers, musicians, and crew members as each leg of the tour comes to a close.\n\n\"Bonus day is so important because setting a precedent with the Eras Tour is really important to me. Because people who work on the road, if the tour grosses more, they get more of a bonus,\" Swift tells the camera. \"And these people just work so hard, and they are the best at what they do.\"\n\nSwift also says she hand-wrote notes to deliver with each bonus, all part of her effort to make the tour's grueling two-year schedule \"worthwhile.\"\n\n\"It took me a couple weeks, but it's fun to write them notes. It's fun to think about everybody's lives that they're going to go back to, and the time off they're going to have, and the kids they haven't seen because they've been away for months,\" Swift says. \"It feels like Christmas morning when you finally get to say thank you.\"\n\nThe next scene shows Swift personally handing out bonuses to her dancers, who'd recently been tasked with overhauling the three-and-a-half-hour show — reordering the set list and learning new choreography — to perform additional songs from \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" Swift's 11th album, which was released between the tour's stops in Singapore and France.\n\n\"This leg of this tour has been harder than anything I've ever done in a live setting. And you guys have taken this on with such excitement and such curiosity,\" Swift tells her dancers. \"The endurance you've shown, but the spirit you've shown, how much you've given to these crowds — that gives to me every single night. The tour has done really well, thanks to all of our hard work.\"\n\nOne of Swift's dancers, Kameron Saunders, reads the bonus amount out loud to the group. Although the number itself is censored in the footage, the dancers react with visible shock.\n\nPeople previously reported that Swift gave $197 million in bonuses to the crew of the Eras Tour, including caterers, lighting technicians, audio technicians, riggers, carpenters, choreographers, and more. A shot of envelopes in the docuseries reveals a stack labeled \"wardrobe/makeup/hair,\" and another labeled \"venue security.\"\n\nMichael Scherkenbach, founder and CEO of the Colorado-based trucking company Shomotion — one of two transportation companies used by the tour — has also said that each trucker received a $100,000 check and handwritten letter from Swift. He described the amount of money as \"life-changing.\"\n\n\"The typical amount is $5,000 to $10,000 each,\" Scherkenbach told CNN. \"So this large amount is unbelievable.\"\n\nThe success of the Eras Tour propelled Swift's net worth into the billions, according to Forbes. The publication's estimates are largely based on the value of Swift's musical catalog.\n\nEarlier this year, Swift bought the rights to her back catalog in a reported $360 million sale.\n\n\"That's how I spent that Eras Tour money,\" Swift told Stephen Colbert. \"My fans are why I was able to get my music back.\"",

    "fullText": "US Air Force pilots have a new training aircraft, the T-7 Red Hawk, promising to prepare them to fly fifth-generation fighters, stealth bombers, and the US' planned sixth-generation fighter.\n\nThe first T-7 Red Hawk trainer, made by Boeing, arrived at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph in Texas this month. The new training aircraft will replace Northrop Grumman's T-38 Talon, which pilots have been training on for six decades. The Air Force no longer deems the trainer sufficient for preparing the service's pilots for future warfare. That's why replacing the outdated Talon has been on the Air Force's to-do list for years.\n\n\"The T-38 has been life-extended multiple times,\" said Brig. Gen. Matthew Leard, director of plans, program, requirements, and international Affairs for Air Education and Training Command, in a statement. \"There's an escalating cost of retaining the airplane and keeping it flyable,\" he said, adding that the plane \"is no longer aligned with current or future aircraft.\"\n\nIn 2023, the Government Accountability Office, a government watchdog agency, reported the Air Force was relying on the aging T-38 as a new flight simulator was delayed by a decade and new training aircraft were being developed. The aircraft, the GAO said, \"is increasingly expensive to maintain and is no longer reflective of modern combat aircraft.\"\n\nThe Air Force sees the transition to the new T-7 Red Hawk as a fundamental shift in how pilots are trained for high-stress, modern air combat.\n\n\"From day one, students won't just be learning to fly,\" Maj. Gen. Gregory Kreuder, the 19th Air Force commander, said in a statement. They'll be learning to manage information, interpret data from advanced sensors, and make critical decisions in a complex environment, all from within the trainer.\"\n\n\"This aircraft,\" he said, \"enables us to close the gap between basic pilot training and the realities of fifth generation plus warfare, producing more capable, intuitive warfighters right out of the gate.\"\n\nThe new T-7 Red Hawk will teach pilots how to fly some of the most advanced aircraft the US has, like the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II stealth aircraft.\n\nAnd under the hood of the sleek, red-tailed trainer is a flexible open design that can be updated with new features as they arrive. The trainer will also prepare pilots to fly aircraft still in development and testing, such as the new B-21 Raider stealth bomber and the upcoming sixth-gen F-47, which is being built by Boeing.\n\nAlong with the T-7 Red Hawk, new ground and maintenance training systems will help pilots build skills and keep aircraft mission-ready. A live-virtual-constructive setup — which links real flights and simulators into the same scenarios — will let the Air Force update training with new threats, platforms, and weapons without needing a new aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force still has several steps to take before the T-7 Red Hawk becomes operational.\n\nThe jet is still in development, and both pilots and maintenance personnel will need training on the systems. Instructor pilots will fly it first, with students following after. The T-7 is expected to reach initial operational capability in August 2027, with 14 aircraft expected at the 99th Flying Training Squadron at Randolph Air Force Base later that year. Until then, pilots will train on the T-6 Texan II.\n\nOther Air Force bases, like Columbus in Mississippi, Laughlin in Texas, Vance in Oklahoma, and Sheppard in Texas, will get more T-7 Red Hawks in the following years.\n\n\"The aircraft delivery is the first physical representation of progress within the program,\" Leard said.",

This week, Google DeepMind introduced the FACTS Benchmark Suite, which measures how reliably AI models produce factually accurate answers.\n\nIt tests models in four areas: answering factoid questions from internal knowledge, using web search effectively, grounding responses in long documents, and interpreting images.

    "description": "Lisp in Life is a Lisp interpreter implemented in Conway’s Game of Life.",
    "fullText": "Lisp in Life is a Lisp interpreter implemented in Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nThe entire pattern is viewable on the browser here.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a high-level programming language was interpreted in Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nLisp is a language with a simple and elegant design, having an extensive ability to express sophisticated ideas as simple programs. Notably, the powerful feature of macros could be used to modify the language’s syntax to write programs in a highly flexible way. For example, macros can be used to introduce new programming paradigms to the language, as demonstrated in object-oriented-like.lisp (which can actually be evaluated by the interpreter, although complex programs take quite a long time to finish running), where a structure and syntax similar to classes in Object Oriented Programming is constructed. Despite the expressibility of Lisp, it is the world’s second oldest high-level programming language introduced in 1958, only to be preceded by Fortran.\n\nConway’s Game of Life is a cellular automaton proposed in 1970. Despite it having a very simple set of rules, it is known to be Turing Complete. Lisp in Life demonstrates this fact in a rather straightforward way.\n\nHow can simple systems allow human thoughts to be articulated and be expanded? With the expressibility of Lisp and the basis of Conway’s Game of Life, Lisp in Life provides an answer to this question.\n\nThe Lisp program is provided by editing certain cells within the pattern to represent the ASCII-encoding of the Lisp program. The pattern directly reads this text and evaluates the results. You can also load your own Lisp program into the pattern and run it.\nThe standard output is written at the bottom end of the RAM module, which can be easily located and directly examined in a Game of Life viewer.\nThe Lisp implementation supports lexical closures and macros, allowing one to write Lisp programs in a Lisp-like taste, as far as the memory limit allows you to.\n\nThe Lisp interpreter is written in C. Using the build system for this project, you can also compile your own C11-compatible C code and run in on Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nAs previously mentioned,\nto the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a high-level programming language was interpreted in Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nThe entry featuring Universal Computers in LifeWiki has a list of computers created in the Game of Life.\nTwo important instances not mentioned in this entry are the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project\ncreated by the authors of the QFT project, and APGsembly created by Adam P. Goucher.\nAll of these work are designed to run an assembly language and are not designed to interpret a high-level language per se.\n\nAn example of a compiled high-level language targeted for the Game of Life is Cogol by the QFT project.\nCogol is compiled to the assembly language QFTASM, targeted for the QFT architecture.\nAlthough Cogol is targeted for the QFT architecture, it requires compilation to QFTASM for the code to be run in the QFT architecture.\n\nIn Lisp in Life, a modified version of the QFT architecture is first created for improving the pattern’s runtime.\nModifications include introducing a new cascaded storage architecture for the ROM, new opcodes, extending the ROM and RAM address space, etc.\nThe Lisp source code is then written into the computer’s RAM module as its raw binary ASCII format.\nThe Conway’s Game of Life pattern directly reads, parses, and evaluates this Lisp source code to produce its output.\nThis feature of allowing a Conway’s Game of Life pattern to evaluate a high-level programming language expressed as a string of text\nis a novel feature that was newly achieved in this project.\n\nHere is a YouTube video showing Lisp in Life in action:\n\nAn overview of the entire architecture.\n\nAn overview of the CPU and its surrounding modules. On the top are the ROM modules, with the lookup module on the right, and the value modules on the left. On the bottom left is the CPU. On the bottom right is the RAM module.\n\nThis pattern is the VarLife version of the architecture. VarLife is an 8-state cellular automaton defined in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project, which is used as an intermediate layer to create the final Conway’s Game of Life pattern. The colors of the cells indicate the 8 distinct states of the VarLife rule.\n\nThe architecture is based on Tetris8.mc in the original QFT repository. Various modifications were made to make the pattern compact, such as introducing a new lookup table architecture for the ROM, removing and adding new opcodes, expanding the ROM and RAM address space, etc.\n\nThe Conway’s Game of Life version of the architecture, converted from the VarLife pattern.\nWhat appears to be a single cell in this image is actually an OTCA metapixel zoomed away to be shown 2048 times smaller.\n\nA close-up view of a part of the ROM module in the Conway’s Game of Life version.\nEach pixel in the previous image is actually this square-shaped structure shown in this image.\nThese structures are OTCA metapixels, which can be seen to be in the On and Off meta-states in this image.\nThe OTCA Metapixel is a special Conway’s Game of Life pattern that can emulate cellular automatons with customized rules.\nThe original VarLife pattern is simulated this way so that it can run in Conway’s Game of Life.\n\nThe OTCA Metapixel simulating Life in Life can be seen in this wonderful video by Phillip Bradbury: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP5-iIeKXE8\n\nA video of the RAM module in the VarLife rule in action.\n\nThe computer showing the results of the following Lisp program:\n\nThe result is 42, shown in binary ascii format (0b110100, 0b110010), read in bottom-to-up order.\n\nAs shown in this image, the standard output of the Lisp program gets written at the bottom end of the RAM module, and can be directly viewed in a Game of Life viewer.\nThis repository also contains scripts that run on Golly to decode and view the contents of the output as strings.\n\nThe Lisp interpreter, written in C, is compiled to an assembly language for a CPU architecture implemented in the Game of Life, which is a modification of the computer used in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project. The compilation is done using an extended version of ELVM (the Esoteric Language Virtual Machine). The Game of Life backend for ELVM was implemented by myself.\n\nGenerating a small enough pattern that runs in a reasonable amount of time required a lot of effort.\nThis required optimizations and improvements in every layer of the project; a brief summary would be:\n\nA more detailed description of the optimizations done in this project is available in the Implementation Details section.\n\nVarLife is an 8-state cellular automaton defined in the Quest For Tetris (QFT) Project.\nIt is used as an intermediate layer to generate the final Conway’s Game of Life pattern; the computer is first created in VarLife, and then converted to a Game of Life pattern.\n\nWhen converting VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life, each VarLife cell is mapped to an OTCA Metapixel (OTCAMP). The conversion from VarLife to the Game of Life is done in a way so that the behavior of the states of the VarLife pattern matches exactly with the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels in the converted Game of Life pattern.\nTherefore, it is enough to verify the behavior of the VarLife pattern to verify the behavior of the Game of Life pattern.\n\nDue to the use of OTCA Metapixels, each VarLife cell becomes extended to a 2048x2048 Game of Life cell, and 1 VarLife generation requires 35328 Game of Life generations. Therefore, the VarLife patterns run significantly faster than the Game of Life (GoL) version.\n\nAdditional details on VarLife are available in the Miscellaneous section.\n\nPattern files preloaded with various Lisp programs are available here.\nDetailed statistics such as the running time and the memory consumption are available in the Running Times and Statistics section.\n\nThe patterns can be simulated on the Game of Life simulator Golly.\n\nThe VarLife patterns can be simulated on Golly as well.\nTo run the VarLife patterns, open Golly and see File -> Preferences -> Control, and Check the “Your Rules” directory.\nOpen the directory, and copy https://github.com/woodrush/QFT-devkit/blob/main/QFT-devkit/Varlife.rule to the directory.\n\nobject-oriented-like.lisp:\n This example creates a structure similar to classes in Object-Oriented Programming, using closures.\n\nThe Lisp interpreter’s variable scope and the macro feature is powerful enough to manage complex memory management,\n and even providing a new syntax to support the target paradigm.\n\nprintquote.lisp: A simple demonstration of macros.\n\nfactorial.lisp: A simple demonstration of recursion with the factorial function.\n\nz-combinator.lisp:\nDemonstration of the Z Combinator to implement a factorial function\nusing anonymous recursion.\n\nbackquote-splice.lisp:\nImplements the backquote macro used commonly in Lisp to construct macros.\nIt also supports the unquote and unquote-splice operations, each written as ~ and ~@.\n\nprimes.lisp: Prints a list of prime numbers up to 20. This example highlights the use of the while syntax.\n\nThe contents of print.lisp is quite straightforward - it calculates and prints the result of 3 * 14.\nbackquote.lisp and primes-print.lisp are similar to backquote-splice.lisp and primes.lisp, mainly included for performance comparisons.\nbackquote.lisp doesn’t implement the unquote-splice operation, and demonstrates some more examples.\nprimes-print.lisp reduces the number of list operations to save memory usage.\n\nThis Lisp interpreter supports lexical closures.\nThe implementation of lexical closures is powerful enough to write an object-oriented-like code as shown in object-oriented-like.lisp,\nwhere classes are represented as lexical closures over the field variables and the class methods.\n\nThis Lisp interpreter supports macros. Lisp macros can be thought as a function that receives code and returns code.\nFollowing this design, macros are treated exacly the same as lambdas, except that it takes the arguments as raw S-expressions,\nand evaluates the result twice (the first time to build the expression, and the second time to actually evaluate the builded expression).\n\nConway’s Game of Life (GoL) Patterns\n\nThe running times for each program are shown above. The Hashlife algorithm used for the simulation requires a lot of memory in exchange of speedups.\nThe simulations were run on a 32GB-RAM computer, with Golly’s memory usage limit set to 28000 MB, and the default base step to 2 (configurable from the preferences).\nThe memory usage was measured by Ubuntu’s activity monitor. “(max.)” shows where the maximum permitted memory was used.\nThe number of CPU cycles and the QFT memory usage was obtained by running the QFTASM interpreter on the host PC.\nThe QFT memory usage shows the number of RAM addresses that were written at least once.\nThe memory usage is measured in words, which is 16 bits in this architecture.\n\nAll of the VarLife patterns can actually be run on a computer. The shortest running time is about 1 minute for print.lisp.\nA sophisticated program such as object-oriented-like.lisp can even run in about 22 minutes.\n\nOn the other hand, the Game of Life patterns take significantly more time than the VarLife patterns, but for short programs it can be run in a moderately reasonable amount of time.\nFor example, print.lisp finishes running in about 6 hours in the Game of Life pattern.\nAs mentioned in the “Conversion from VarLife to Conway’s Game of Life” section, since the Game of Life pattern emulates the behavior of the VarLife pattern using OTCA Metapixels,\nthe behavior of the Game of Life patterns can be verified by running the VarLife patterns.\n\nThere are tests to check the behavior of the Lisp interpreter.\nThere is a test for checking the QFTASM-compiled Lisp interpreter using the QFTASM interpreter, and a test for checking the GCC-compiled Lisp interpreter on the host pc.\nTo run these tests, use the following commands:\n\nRunning make test requires Hy, a Clojure-like Lisp implemented in Python available via pip install hy.\nSome of the tests compare the output results of Hy and the output of the QFTASM Lisp interpreter.\n\nThe tests were run on Ubuntu and Mac.\n\nThis section explains how to load the Lisp interpreter (written in C) to the Game of Life pattern, and also how to load a custom Lisp program into the pattern to run it on Game of Life.\n\nPlease see build.md from the GitHub repository.\n\nThis section describes the implementation details for the various optimizations for the QFT assembly and the resulting Game of Life pattern.\n\nThe optimized string lookup process is as follows.\nFirst, when the Lisp parser accepts a symbol token, it creates a 4-bit hash of the string with the checksum of the ASCII representation of the string. The hash points to a hashtable that holds the root of a binary search tree for string comparison. Each node in the tree holds the string of the symbol token, and two nodes that are before and after the token in alphabetical order. When a query symbol token arrives in the parsing phase, a node with a matching token is returned, or a new node for the token is added into this binary tree if the token does not exist yet. This allows for each distinct symbol in the S-expression to have a distinct memory address.\n\nIn the interpretation phase, since each distinct symbol has a distinct memory address, and every string required for the Lisp program has already been parsed, string comparison can be done by simply comparing the memory address of the tokens. Since the interpreter only uses string equality operations for string comparison, simply checking for integer equality suffices for string comparison, speeding up the interpretation phase. Since the hash key is 4 bits long, this allows for reducing 4 searches in the binary tree compared to using a single binary tree.\n\nThere are 17 distinct procedures for evaluating the special forms in the Lisp interpreter,\ndefine, if, quote, car, cdr, cons, atom, print, progn, while, {lambda, macro}, eval, eq, {+, -, *, /, mod}, {<, >}, list, and lambda/macro invocations (when if the token is not a special form). Using an if statement to find the corresponding procedure for a given token becomes a linear search for the token comparisons. To speed up this search process, a hash table is created for jumping to the corresponding procedures. Since the memory addresses for the special forms can be determined before parsing the Lisp program, all of the symbols for the special forms have a fixed memory address. Therefore, the hash key can be created by subtracting an offset to the symbol’s memory address, to point to a hashtable that is created near the register locations. This hashtable is provided in memheader.eir. When the hash key is larger than the regions of this hashtable, it means that the symbol is not a special form, so the evaluation jumps to the lambda/macro invocation procedure.\n\nThe Lisp implementation has 3 distinct value types, ATOM, INT, and LAMBDA. Each value only consumes one QFT byte of memory; the ATOM value holds the pointer to the symbol’s string hashtable, the INT value holds the signed integer value, and LAMBDA holds a pointer to the Lambda struct, as well as its subtype information, of either LAMBDA, MACRO, TEMPLAMBDA and TEMPMACRO. (The TEMPLAMBDA and TEMPMACRO subtypes are lambda and macro types that recycles its argument value memory space every time it is called, but is unused in the final lisp programs.) Since the RAM’s address space is only 10 bits, there are 6 free bits that can be used for addresses holding pointers. Therefore, the value type and subtype information is held in these free bits. This makes the integer in the Lisp implementation to be a 14-bit signed integer, ranging from -8192 to 8191.\n\nSince the C compiler used in this project does not have memory optimization features, this has to be done manually within the C source code. This led to the largest reason why the interpreter’s source code seems to be obfuscated.\n\nOne of the largest bottlenecks for memory access was stack region usage. Every time a stack region memory access occurs, the assembly code performs memory address offset operations to access the stack region. This does not happen when accessing the heap memory, since there is only one heap region used in the entire program, so the pointers for global variables can be hard-coded by the assembler. Therefore, it is favorable optimization-wise to use the heap memory as much as possible.\n\nOne way to make use of this fact is to use as much global variables as possible. Since registers and common RAM memory share the same memory space, global variables can be accessed with a speed comparable to registers (However, since the physical location of the RAM memory slot within the pattern affects the I/O signal arrival time, and the registers have the most smallest RAM addresses, i.e. they are the closest to the CPU unit, the registers have the fastest memory access time).\n\nAnother method of saving memory was to use union memory structures to minimize the stack region usage. In the C compiler used in this project, every time a new variable is introduced in a function, the function’s stack region usage (used per call) is increased to fit all of the variables. This happens even when two variables never appear at the same time. Therefore, using the fact that some variables never appear simultaneously, unions are used for every occurence of such variables, so that they can use a shared region within the stack space. This led to minimization of the stack region usage. Since the stack region is only 233 hextets (1 byte in the QFT RAM is 16 bits) large, this allowed to increase the number of nested function calls, especially the nested calls of eval which evaluates the S-expressions. Since the S-expressions have a list structure, and eval becomes nested when lambdas are called in the Lisp program, this optimization was significant for allowing more sophisticated Lisp programs to be run in the architecture.\n\nThe QFT assembly generated by the C compiler has a lot of room for optimization. I therefore created a compiler optimization tool to reduce the QFTASM assembly size.\n\nImmediate constant expressions such as ADD 1 2 destination is folded to a MOV operation.\n\nThe QFT assembly code can be splitted into subregions by jump operations, such that:\n\nThe last guarantee where jumps never occur in the middle of a subregion is provided by the C compiler. The ELVM assembly’s program counter is designed so that it increases only when a jump instruction appears. This makes an ELVM program counter to point to a sequence of multiple instructions, instead of a single instruction. Since the ELVM assembly uses the ELVM program counter for its jump instructions, it is guaranteed that the jump instructions in the QFT assembly never jump to the middle of any subregion, and always jumps to a beginning of a subregion.\n\nIn each subregion, the dependency graph for the memory address is created. If a memory address becomes written but is later overwritten without becoming used in that subregion at all, the instruction to write to that memory address is removed. Since it is guaranteed that jump operations never jump to the middle of any subregion, it is guaranteed that the overwritten values can be safely removed without affecting the outcome of the program. The MOV folding optimization makes use of this fact to remove unnecessary instructions.\n\nThis folding process is also done with dereferences; if a dereferenced memory address is written, and the address is overwritten without being used at all, and the dereference source is unoverwritten at all during this process, the instruction for writingto the dereferenced memory address is removed.\n\nIf the destination of a conditional or fixed-destination jump instruction points to another jump instruction with a fixed destination, the jump destination is folded to the latter jump instruction’s destination.\n\nA similar folding is done when a fixed jump instruction points to a conditional jump instruction, where the fixed jump instruction is replaced by the latter conditional jump instruction.\n\nIn this image of the CPU and its surrounding modules, the two modules on the top are the ROM modules. The original ROM module had one table, with the memory address as the key and the instruction as the value. I recreated the ROM module to add a lookup table layer, where each distinct instruction (not the opcodes, but the entire instruction including the values used within) holds a distinct serial integer key. The ROM module on the right accepts a program counter address and returns the instruction key for the program counter. The module on the left accepts the instruction key and returns the actual bits of the instruction as the output. This allows for dictionary compression to be performed to the ROM data, saving a lot of space. Since the instructions are 45 bits and the instruction keys are only 10 bits, the instruction key table is 1/4 the size of the original ROM module. Although the ROM size is 3223 for the entire Lisp interpreter, there were only 616 distinct instructions in the Lisp interpreter, making the size of the instruction table be 616 ROM units high, effectively reducing the ROM module size altogether.\n\nThe ROM module features another form of compression, where absence of cells are used to represent 0-valued bits within the instruction. Below is a close-up look of the ROM value module:\n\nNotice that some cells on the left are absent, despite the table being expected to be a rectangular shape. This is because absent cells do not emit any signals, hence effectively emitting 0-valued bits as the output. To use this fact, all of the instructions are first alphabetically ordered at table creation time, so that instructions that start with trailing zeroes become located higher in the table (further from the signal source). This allows for a maximum number of cells to be replaced with absent units to represent 0-valued bits. In fact, the instruction for no-ops is represented as all zeroes, so all of the units in the value module are replaced by absent cells. The no-op instruction appears a lot of times immediately after the jump operation, due to the fact that the QFT architecture has a branch delay when invoking a jump instruction, requiring a no-op instruction to be present to compensate for the delay.\n\nI removed the AND, OR, SL (shift left), SRL (shift right logical), and the SRA (shift right arithmetical) opcodes, and added the SRU (shift right unit) and SRE (shift right eight) opcodes to the architecture. Since there already were opcodes for XOR (bitwise-xor) and ANT (bitwise-and-not), AND and OR, which were not used much in the interpreter, could be replaced by these opcodes. The bitshift operations had significantly larger patterns than the other opcodes, being more than 10 times larger than the other opcodes. These were reduced to a fixed-size shift operations which could be implemented in the same sizes as the other opcodes. Since the shift left opcode can be replaced by consecutively adding its own value, effectively multiplying by powers of 2, the opcode was safely removed. The main reason for the original bitshift units being large was due to the shift amounts being dependent on the values of the RAM. Converting a binary value to a physical (in-pattern) shift amount required a large pattern. On the other hand, shifting a fixed value could be implemented by a significantly more simpler pattern. The shift right eight instruction is mainly used for reading out the standard input, where each ASCII character in the input string is packed into one 16-bit RAM memory address.\n\nThis resulted in a total of exactly 8 opcodes, ANT, XOR, SRE, SRU, SUB, ADD, MLZ, and MNZ. Since this can fit in 3 bits, the opcode region for the instruction value was reduced by 1 bit. Since the RAM module is 10 bits, and the third value of the instruction is always the writing destination of the RAM, and the first instruction can also be made so that it becomes the reading source address of the RAM, this allows for an additional 6*2=12 bits to be reduced from the instruction length. These altogether has reduced the ROM word size from 58 to 45 bits, reducing nearly 1/4 of the original instruction size.\n\nThe original QFT architecture had a ROM and RAM address space of 9 and 7 bits. I extended the ROM and RAM address space to 12 and 10 bits, respectively. This was not a straightforward task as it first seemed, since the signal arrival timings between the modules had to be carefully adjusted in order for the signals to line up correctly. This involved reverse-engineering and experimenting undocumented VarLife pattern units used in the original QFT architecture. The same held for when redesigning other parts of the architecture.\n\nSince each byte of the RAM module can be ordered arbitrarily in the CPU’s architecture, the RAM is arranged so that the standard output is written at the very bottom of the RAM module, and proceeds upwards. Therefore, the contents of the RAM can easily be observed in a Game of Life viewer by directly examining the bottom of the RAM module.\n\nSince RAM has 16 bits of memory per memory address, it allows to fit two ASCII-encoded characters per one address. Therefore, the standard input is read out by reading two characters per address. For the standard output, one character is written to one address for aesthetic reasons, so that the characters can be directly observed in a Game of Life viewer the pattern more easily. Also, for the standard output to proceed upwards within the RAM module pattern, the memory pointer for the standard output proceeds backwards in the memory space, while the pointer for the standard input proceeds forwards in the memory space.\n\nOptimizing the Game of Life layer mainly revolved around understanding the Macrocell format for representing and saving Game of Life patterns, and the Hashlife algorithm. The Macrocell format uses quadtrees and memoization for compressing repeated patterns. Since the final Game of Life pattern is an array of OTCA metapixels which are 2048x2048 large, and even has repeated patterns in the VarLife layer (meaning that there are repeated configurations of OTCA metapixels), this compression reduces the file size for the QFT pattern significantly. The best example that let me understand the Macrocell format was an example provided by Adam P. Goucher in this thread in Golly’s mailing list.\n\nThe Hashlife algorithm also uses quadtrees and memoization to speed up the Game of Life simulations. This algorithm makes use of the fact that the same pattern in a same time frame influences only a fixed extent of its surrounding regions, hence allowing for memoization.\n\nAs for optimization, I first noticed that the QFT pattern had a 1-pixel high pattern concatenated to the entire pattern. The original QFT pattern in the original QFT repository was carefully designed so that it is composed of 8x8-sized pattern units. Therefore, most of the patterns can be represented by 8x8 tiles. However, since the 1-pixel high pattern at the top creates an offset that shifts away the pattern from this 8x8 grid, it causes the pattern to have fewer repeated patterns if interpreted from the corner of its bounding box, causing the memoization to work inefficiently. I therefore tried putting a redundant cell (which does not interfere with the rest of the pattern) to realign the entire pattern to its 8x8 grid, which actually slightly reduced the resulting Macrocell file size from the original one. Although I didn’t compare the running times, since the Hashlife algorithm uses memoization over repeated patterns as well, I expect this optimization to at least slightly contribute to the performance of the simulation.\n\nAnother optimization was improving the metafier script used to convert VarLife patterns to Game of Life (MetafierV3.py). The original script used a square region to fit the entire pattern to create the quadtree representation. However, since the Lisp in Life VarLife pattern is 968 pixels wide but 42354 pixels high, it tried to allocate a 65536x65536-sized integer array, which was prohibitively large to run. I modified the script so that it uses a rectangular region, where absent regions of the quadtree are represented as absent cells. Although this is very straightforward with the knowledge of the Macrocell format, it was difficult at first until I became fond of the algorithms surrounding the Game of Life.\n\nThe memory region map is carefully designed to save space. This is best described with the operation phases of the interpreter.\n\nVarious precalculations are done after the interpreter starts running. The construction of the string interning hashtable for reserved atoms such as define, quote, etc. are done in this phase. For the GCC-compiled interpreter, some variables that are defined in the QFT memory header are defined in the C source.\n\nSince the outcome of these precalculations are always the same for any incoming Lisp program, this phase is done on the host PC, and the results are saved as ramdump.csv during the QFTASM compile time. The results are then pre-loaded into the RAM when the VarLife and Game of Life patterns are created. This allows to saves some CPU cycles when running the interpreter.\n\nAs explained earlier, the QFT architecture holds register values in the RAM. There are 11 registers, which are placed in the addresses from 0 to 10.\n\nThe reserved values in the image include strings such as reserved atoms and the destinations of the jump hashtable used for evaluation. The rest of the region is used for storing global variables in the interpreter’s C source code.\n\nThe Lisp program provided from the standard input is parsed into S-expressions, which is written into the heap region.\n\nNotice that the string interning hashtables are created in the later end of the stack region. This is because these hashtables are only used during the parsing phase, and can be overwritten during the evaluation phase. For most Lisp programs including the ones in this repository, the stack region does not grow far enough to overwrite these values. This allows to place 3 growing memory regions during the parsing phase, the stack region used for nested S-expressions, the heap region which stores the parsed S-expressions, and the string interning hashtables when new strings are detected within the Lisp program. Newly detected strings such as variable names in the Lisp program are also written into the heap region.\n\nThe heap region is also designed so that it overwrites the standard input as it parses the program. Since older parts of the program can be discarded once it is parsed, this allows to naturally free the standard input region which save a lot of space after parsing. The standard input also gets overwritten by the Standard output if the output is long enough. However, due to this design, long programs may have trouble at parsing, since the input may be overwritten too far and get deleted before it is parsed. A workaround for this is to use indentation which places the program further ahead into the memory, which will prevent the program from being overwritten from the growing heap region. For all of the programs included in this repository, this is not an issue and the programs become successfully parsed.\n\nThis is one of the most interesting ideas in the original QFT project to make the QFT architecture possible. As explained in the original QFT post, the 8 states of VarLife are actually a mixture of 4 different birth/survival rules with binary states. This means that each VarLife cell can only transition between two fixed states, and the birth/survival rule for that cell does not change at any point in time. Moreover, the OTCA Metapixel is designed so that each metapixel can carry its own birth/survival rules. Therefore, each VarLife cell can be enoded into an OTCA Metapixel by specifying its birth/survival rule and the binary state. This means that the array of OTCA Metapixels in the metafied pattern is actually a mixture of metapixels with different birth/survival rules, arranged in a way so that it makes the computation possible.\n\nAfter the program counter is set to 65535 and the program exits, no more ROM and RAM I/O signals become apparent in the entire module.\nThis makes the VarLife pattern becomes completely stationary, where every pattern henceforth becomes completely identical.\nDefining this as the halting time for the calculation, the pattern for print.lisp halts at exactly 105,413,068 VarLife generations.\n\nThe halting time for the Game of Life patterns are defined similarly for the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels.\nSince OTCA Metapixels never become stationary, the Game of Life states do not become stationary after the halting time,\nbut the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels will become stationary after the halting time.\n\nFor the VarLife pattern of print.lisp, by generation 105,387,540, the value 65535 gets written to the program counter. At generation 105,413,067, the last signal becomes just one step from disappearing, and at generation 105,413,068 and onwards, the pattern becomes completely stationary and every pattern becomes identical to each other.\nIn the Game of Life version, since the OTCA Metapixel continues running indefinitely, the pattern does not become completly stationary, but the meta-states of the OTCA Metapixels will become completely stationary, since it is an emulation of the VarLife pattern.\nNote that the halting times for programs other than print.lisp is just a sufficient number of generations, and not the exact values.\n\nThe required number of generations per CPU cycle depends on many factors such as the ROM and RAM addresses and the types of opcodes, since the arriving times of the I/O signals depend on factors such as these as well. This makes the number of generations required for the program to halt become different between each program.\nFor example, print.lisp has a rate of 23822.16 generations per CPU cycle (GpC), but z-combinator.lisp has a rate of 28870.81 GpC, and primes-print.lisp has 31502.43 GpC. 23822.16 GpC is in fact insufficient for z-combinator.lisp to finish running, and 28870.81 is also insufficient for primes-print.lisp to finish running.\n\nThe ALU unit in the CPU. From the left are the modules for the ANT, XOR, SRE, SRU, SUB, ADD, MLZ, and the MNZ opcodes.\n\nThe SRE and the SRU opcodes were newly added for this project.\n\nThe CPU architecture used in this project was originally created by\nthe members of the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project,\nand was later optimized and modified by Hikaru Ikuta for the Lisp in Life project.\nThe VarLife cellular automaton rule was also defined by the members of the QFT project.\nThe metafier for converting VarLife patterns to Conway’s Game of Life patterns was written by the members of the QFT project,\nand was later modified by Hikaru Ikuta to support the pattern size of the Lisp in Life architecture.\nThe assembly language for the QFT architecture, QFTASM, was also originally designed by the members of the QFT project,\nand was later modified by Hikaru Ikuta for this project for achieving a feasible running time.\nThe Lisp interpreter was written by Hikaru Ikuta.\nThe compilation of the interpreter’s C source code to the ELVM assembly is done using an extended version of 8cc\n\nThe compilation from the ELVM assembly to QFTASM is done by an extended version of ELVM (the Esoteric Language Virtual Machine),\na project by Shinichiro Hamaji from Preferred Networks, Inc.\nThe Game of Life backend for ELVM was written by Hikaru Ikuta, and was later further extended by Hikaru for the Lisp in Life project.",

Mangione's possessions, as described during the hearing, included a MacBook laptop, an iPhone, multiple thumb drives, and a small circuit board wrapped in cardboard.\n\nIt had not been previously revealed that Mangione may have been into crypto. Still, he once gained a small following among crypto investors.\n\nSoon after his arrest, a LUIGI memecoin was launched in his name, and quickly surged in value, reaching a $60 million market capitalization, according to multiple contemporaneous accounts in the crypto press.\n\nJust as quickly, it cratered; a $1,000 investment made at the coin's launch, in mid-December 2024, would be worth about $25 now.\n\nMangione's evidence suppression hearing is scheduled to start its third week on Tuesday.",

My wife posted in a local email group and a potential buyer got in touch with a question.\n\n\"Do you happen to know the model? I would love to look it up online rather than asking you lots of questions. :) Thanks!\" she wrote.\n\nThis is an old couch, so all product codes dissolved in the sands of time years ago. So, I took two photos of the furniture, uploaded them to Gemini, and asked for help. The Google chatbot sent back its best guess in seconds:\n\n\"Tillary Sectional: This is a very popular, modular West Elm sofa that was available around that time.\n\nAppearance Match: The low back and deep seat are very characteristic of the Tillary. The Tillary is known for having interchangeable backrests that can be moved or removed, and your sofa's armless chaise and backrests look like they might be loose cushions or pieces, which is a key Tillary feature.\n\nNote: Search results show the Tillary was being reviewed and discussed around 2014, making it a strong possibility for a 2013 purchase.\"\n\nGemini also shared other useful tips on how to identify the product, such as \"Some West Elm couches have a zippered compartment on the back or bottom where extra components (like legs or connectors) are stored, and a tag may be inside.\"\n\nThat was enough to find a product match and send all the details over to the buyer. We closed the deal, for $200, on Tuesday. That's enough for 10 months of a Gemini Pro subscription.\n\nThis holiday period, the Barr family plans to spend a lot of time slouching on our new, fancy couch. I call it the \"AI bubble couch.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Bruno Mars is back at Dolby Live in Las Vegas for NYE 2025. Both shows are sold out — here's how to get Bruno Mars tickets for future residency dates.",
    "fullText": "Bruno Mars continues to electrify audiences with his long‑running Dolby Live at Park MGM residency on the Las Vegas Strip, which first launched in 2016 and has become one of the city's most in‑demand concert experiences. As of now, Mars has special New Year's Eve performances scheduled for December 30 and 31, 2025, both of which are sold out due to high demand and limited availability. If you're planning a future trip to Vegas and want to catch him live, below is a complete guide on how to buy Bruno Mars tickets and where to look for coming shows.\n\nMars first rose to mainstream success with his breakout 2010 hit \"Just the Way You Are,\" and more than 15 years later, he remains a global superstar, delivering chart‑topping music alongside unforgettable live performances. His Dolby Live residency has become a staple of the Las Vegas entertainment scene, with over 100 shows spanning nine years and multiple extended runs due to overwhelming fan interest. Whether you're drawn by classics like \"24K Magic\" or his newer collaborations, seeing Bruno Mars in Vegas is consistently rated as one of the city's most exciting live music experiences.\n\nWe've got you covered if you're looking for how to get tickets to Bruno Mars' 2025 Las Vegas residency concert dates. Here's our breakdown of Bruno Mars' 2025 concert schedule, purchasing details, and price comparisons between original and resale tickets. You can also browse ticket specifics on StubHub and Vivid Seats at your leisure.\n\nBruno Mars only has two shows scheduled for the remainder of 2025, both at Park MGM in Las Vegas. Prices are high because of the holiday season and limited windows to see the artist live.\n\nYou can buy original tickets for Bruno Mars' 2025 Las Vegas residency on Ticketmaster. As of writing, all concert dates have tickets available; however, original tickets sold out for the 2024 residency, so we expect to see that trend continue in 2025.\n\nTickets are also available for purchase through resale ticket vendors such as StubHub and Vivid Seats, and they are currently comparable in price to the original tickets. Since the original tickets are expected to sell out, you may find better luck with seating variety and pricing options through these resale sites.\n\nAs is typically the case with Las Vegas shows, several VIP packages are available. These packages include a range of different perks, from seats to suites, so if you are looking to plan a trip around your visit, it may be worth reviewing your options. Additional information on what each package includes and the prices can be found here.\n\nFrankly, tickets to see Bruno Mars' Las Vegas residency in 2025 aren't cheap, but prices do vary depending on the date and demand for each show.\n\nThe most affordable tickets start at $678 from Vivid Seats and $930 from StubHub, as of the time of writing.\n\nBruno Mars' Las Vegas concert dates will not feature opening acts. This is consistent with his previous residency, so we do not expect any openers to be announced. In the past, Anderson.Paak, Camila Cabello, and Dua Lipa have opened for Mars on tour.\n\nThere are currently no international tour dates announced, as Mars is currently scheduled to perform exclusively in Las Vegas.\n\nNote: Certain services and regions prohibit the resale of tickets. Business Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal reselling of tickets, and entry into an event is at the venue's discretion.",

    "description": "Zillow analyzed millions of listings to forecast home design trends for 2026. Spa-like amenities and color drenching are in, while man caves are out.",
    "fullText": "Another year is on the way, and with it comes a fresh wave of home design trends. Zillow analyzed hundreds of design styles and home features across millions of for-sale listings in 2025, and identified the top emerging home trends for 2026.\n\n\"Listing descriptions are short, so every word counts,\" said Zillow's home trends expert Amanda Pendleton. \"When we see a sharp increase in certain features being mentioned in listings on Zillow, whether it's spa-inspired bathrooms or bespoke artisan craftsmanship, it's a clear signal that these details are capturing buyers' attention right now and hint at what's next in home design.\"\n\nWhile some of 2025's biggest home trends, such as eco-friendly homes and spa-style wellness amenities, will carry into 2026, new ones are also emerging.\n\nHere are seven home trends to watch in 2026 according to Zillow, from the evolution of the \"man cave\" into immersive sports spaces, to the growing demand for cozy reading nooks.\n\nMillennial gray is so 2020. There's a whole rainbow out there, and today's homeowners want bold, vivid color in their homes.\n\nZillow found that \"color drenching\" will be one of the hottest interior design trends in 2026. That's when the interior surfaces — from walls to floors and sometimes even the furniture — are all the same hue, typically a vibrant statement shade.\n\nMentions of the trend have increased by 149% since 2025, according to the company.\n\nZillow found that words like \"sustainable\" and \"green\" are appearing 21% more often in listings, suggesting that buyers are increasingly seeking out eco-friendly homes.\n\nEco-friendly homes do more than help the planet. They can also help homeowners save hundreds or even thousands of dollars by cutting energy use and, in turn, lowering utility bills.\n\nMentions of zero-energy-ready homes — which are built to minimize energy use and maximize renewable production with features like advanced insulation and high-performance windows — are up 70%.\n\nListings mentioning whole-home batteries, which store solar energy and provide backup power, are also up 40%, while references to electric-vehicle charging have climbed 25%.\n\nFrom the Palisades wildfires to the Texas Hill Country floods, this year's natural disasters have claimed many lives and cost the US government and its citizens billions of dollars.\n\nSo it's no surprise that many buyers are seeking homes that offer better protection during extreme weather conditions. According to Zillow, 64% more listings mention flood protection, and references to elevation in relation to flooding have increased by 26%.\n\nBuyers are also increasingly worried about fire risk. Zillow data shows fire-safety features are appearing more often in listings, with mentions of defensible-space landscaping up 36% and fire-protection systems up 28%.\n\nIn a culture built on convenience, anything you can get at home quickly becomes something you expect at home.\n\nMany homeowners have moved beyond standard home-wellness amenities, such as home gyms and basketball courts, and into upgrades like saunas and cold plunges — features once limited to luxury spas but now increasingly attainable through thoughtful home design.\n\nWellness is set to remain a key driver of home design in 2026. According to Zillow, mentions of wellness features in listings are up 33%, and spa-inspired elements are appearing 22% more often on the site.\n\nNews flash: reading is cool again.\n\nIf you've been on social media lately, you've probably seen the chic home libraries that young, design-minded homeowners are putting together. Big or small, they tend to be cozy and highly Instagrammable.\n\nBuyers are taking note as we head into next year. Zillow found that mentions of \"reading nooks\" are appearing 48% more often in its listings.\n\nBuyers are increasingly moving away from generic, copy-and-paste interiors in favor of homes that reflect their personalities.\n\nAccording to Zillow, mentions of vintage accents, whimsical details, and artisan craftsmanship are up 17%, 15%, and 21%, respectively.\n\nThe once-ubiquitous \"man cave\" is finally fading, with Zillow data showing mentions in listings down 10% from last year — but spouses shouldn't celebrate just yet.\n\nBuyers don't just want a room to watch the game anymore; they want spaces that let them fully immerse themselves in their favorite sports.\n\nZillow found that golf simulators are appearing 25% more frequently in listings on its site, while mentions of pickleball courts are also up 25%. Even batting cages are becoming more popular, with references rising 18%.",

Bradbury, the deputy secretary of Transportation and a representative for Duffy to Amtrak's board, said in a statement.\n\nAmtrak did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that around 246 Amtrak managers gave up part of their bonuses that totaled $16.2 million. The DOT did not provide additional comment or confirm those figures when reached by Business Insider.\n\nIn its announcement, the DOT touted Amtrak's record-breaking year. The national passenger rail service had a record 34.5 million customer trips in the fiscal year that ended in September, posting a record adjusted ticket revenue of $2.7 billion.\n\nThe bonuses were reminiscent of some received by other transportation workers this holiday season. The Federal Aviation Administration said it was giving $10,000 bonuses to the nearly 800 air traffic controllers who had perfect attendance during the government shutdown.\n\nHave a tip?

The celebrated neurologist who taught generations to see the poetry in damaged brains invented a lot of that poetry himself.\n\nAccording to a devastating new investigation by Rachel Aviv in The New Yorker, many of the vivid details in Sacks's beloved case studies were fabrications — embellishments designed to make better stories.\n\nThe man who mistook his wife for a hat?

The twins' supposed prime-number abilities were \"widely cited\" in academic literature. Medical schools assigned his books. The whole notion that doctors should see patients as narrative beings, not just bundles of symptoms, drew heavily from his work.\n\nSacks spent decades in therapy exploring why he couldn't stop embellishing.

    "title": "The Coming Need for Formal Specification",
    "description": "The potential of formal verification for reasoning about systems.",
    "fullText": "In late 2022, I had a conversation with a senior engineer on the coming problem\nof “what to do when AI is writing most of the code”. His opinion, which I found\nstriking at the time, was that engineers would transition from writing mostly\n“implementation” code, to mostly writing tests and specifications.\n\nI remember thinking at the time that this was prescient. With three years of\nhindsight, it seems like things are trending in a different direction. I\nthought that the reason that testing and specifications would be useful was\nthat AI agents would be struggling to “grok” coding for quite some time, and\nthat you’d need to have robust specifications such that they could stumble\ntoward correctness.\n\nIn reality, AI written tests were one of the first tasks I felt comfortable\ndelegating. Unit tests are squarely in-distribution for what the models have\nseen on all public open source code. There’s a lot of unit tests in open source\ncode, and they follow predictable patterns. I’d expect that the variance of\nimplementation code – and the requirement for out-of-distribution patterns –\nis much higher than testing code. The result is that models are now quite good\nat translating English descriptions into quite crisp test cases.1\n\nThere exists a higher level problem of holistic system behavior verification,\nthough. Let’s take a quick diversion into systems design to see why.\n\nSystem design happens on multiple scales. You want systems to be robust – both\nin their runtime, and their ability to iteratively evolve. This nudges towards\ndecomposing systems into distinct components, each of which can be internally\ncomplicated but exposes a firm interface boundary that allows you to abstract\nover this internal complexity.\n\nIf we design things well, we can swap out parts of our system without disrupting\nother parts or harming the top-level description of what the system does. We can\nalso perform top-down changes iteratively – adding new components, and retiring\nold ones, at each level of description of the system.\n\nThis all requires careful thinking of how to build these interfaces and\ncomponent boundaries in such a way that (1) there is a clean boundary between\ncomponents and (2) that stringing all the components together actually produces\nthe desired top-level behavior.\n\nTo do this effectively, we require maps of various levels of description of the\nsystem’s\nterritory. My\nconjecture is that code is not a good map for this territory.\n\nTo be clear, I’ve found a lot of value in throwing out system diagram maps and\nlooking directly at the code territory when debugging issues. However,\ncode-level reasoning is often not the best level of abstraction to use for\nreasoning about systems. This is for a similar reason that “modeling all the\nindividual molecules of a car” is not a great way to estimate that car’s braking\ndistance.\n\nLLMs have increasingly longer context windows, so one could naively say “just\nthrow all the code in the context and have it work it out”. Perhaps. But this is\nstill just clearly not the most efficient way to reason about large-scale\nsystems.\n\nThe promise of formal verification is that we can construct provably composable\nmaps which still match the ground-level territory. Formal verification of code\nallows you to specify a system using mathematical proofs, and then exhaustively\nprove that a system is correct. As an analogy: unit tests are like running an\nexperiment. Each passing test is an assertion that, for the conditions checked,\nthe code is correct. There could still exist some untested input that would\ndemonstrate incorrect behavior. You only need one negative test to show the code\nis incorrect, but only a provably exhaustive set of inputs would be sufficient\nto show the code is fully correct. Writing a formal verification of a program is\nmore like writing a proof. Writing a self-consistent proof is sufficient to show\nthat the properties you’ve proven always hold.\n\nI saw Martin Kleppmann’s\n“Prediction: AI will make formal verification go mainstream”\nright after I posted\n“The Decline of the Software Drafter?”,\nwhich became the inspiration for this post. Kleppmann’s argument is that, just\nas the cost of generating code is coming down, so too will the cost of formal\nverification of code:\n\nFor example, as of 2009, the formally verified seL4 microkernel consisted of\n8,700 lines of C code, but proving it correct required 20 person-years and\n200,000 lines of Isabelle code – or 23 lines of proof and half a person-day\nfor every single line of implementation. Moreover, there are maybe a few\nhundred people in the world (wild guess) who know how to write such proofs,\nsince it requires a lot of arcane knowledge about the proof system.\n\nIf formal verification becomes vastly cheaper, then we can afford to verify\nmuch more software. But on top of that, AI also creates a need to formally\nverify more software: rather than having humans review AI-generated code, I’d\nmuch rather have the AI prove to me that the code it has generated is correct.\nIf it can do that, I’ll take AI-generated code over handcrafted code (with all\nits artisanal bugs) any day!\n\nI’ve long been interested in formal verification tools like TLA+ and Rocq (née\nCoq). I haven’t (yet) been able to justify to myself spending all that much time\non them. I think that’s changing: the cost of writing code is\ncoming down dramatically.\nThe cost of reviewing\nand maintaining it is also coming down, but at a slower rate. I agree with\nKleppmann that we need systematic tooling for dealing with this mismatch.\n\nWishcasting a future world, I\nwould be excited to see something like:\n\nThe biggest concern to me related to formal verification is the following two\nexcerpts, first from Kleppmann, and then from Hillel Wayne, a notable proponent\nof TLA+:\n\nThere are maybe a few hundred people in the world (wild guess) who know how to\nwrite such proofs, since it requires a lot of arcane knowledge about the proof\nsystem. –\nMartin Kleppmann\n\nTLA+ is one of the more popular formal specification languages and you can\nprobably fit every TLA+ expert in the world in a large schoolbus. –\nHillel Wayne\n\nFor formal verification to be useful in practice, at least some of the arcane\nknowledge of its internals will need to be broadly disseminated. Reviewing an\nAI-generated formal spec of a problem won’t be useful if you don’t have enough\nknowledge of the proof system to poke holes in what the AI came up with.\n\nI’d argue that undergraduate Computer Science programs should allocate some of\ntheir curriculum to formal verification. After all, students should have more\ntime on their hands as they delegate implementation of their homework to AI\nagents.\n\nThat is, under current optimization pressures. We’re only a few months past\nthe Sonnet 3.7 and\nOpenAI o3 models,\nboth of which had a penchant for reward hacking on tests. ↩︎",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Traveler Should Know",
    "description": "Because visiting exotic locales and experiencing other cultures is a thrill—but getting there can be a drag.",
    "fullText": "We travel for a wide variety of reasons—vacations, business, family obligations—and in a variety of different ways, but there’s one constant: The actual traveling can be hectic, stressful, and expensive. Considering Americans took nearly 2 billion trips in 2025 alone, that stress can be pretty epic. From planning to de-boarding, travel can be a challenge—that is, unless you know and utilize these hacks.\n\nThere are a lot of travel hacks out there in the wild, many of them dubious, but when a hack actually works to lower your costs, increase your comfort, or simply solve an irritating problem, it’s kind of magical. Here are the essential travel hacks everyone should be implementing, whether you’re traveling for pleasure, business, or any other reason.\n\nYou may have been instructed at some point to roll your clothes to make your packing more efficient. It’s not that this doesn’t work—rolling clothes tightly can improve your packing and unpacking experience. But there’s an even better way: Vacuum-sealing. You can use vacuum-sealed storage bags to compress your clothes, allowing you to fit more into your bag (or to travel much lighter with a single carry-on), but there’s a downside: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may require you to uncompress your clothes for a special check as you pass through security, which can wreak havoc on your packing.\n\nA better choice is a carry-on backpack with an included pump, like this. If you are flagged for a special inspection, you can quickly re-compress everything and be on your way.\n\nIf your main goal for travel is to see exotic places, have new experiences, or even see old friends, traveling off-peak is a powerful hack. Off-peak simply means going places when most tourists aren’t there. Most people travel for pleasure during the warmer months, for example, so deciding you’re going on a European tour in February nets you cheaper flights, cheaper hotel rooms, and less crowded everything.\n\nRaise your hand if this has ever happened to you: You realize you need something from a piece of luggage you spent six hours carefully organizing, compressing, and zipping closed. You dig through everything to find what you need, and then re-packing that bag is a sweaty, stressful fail. That’s where packing cubes come in.\n\nPacking cubes don’t necessarily shrink your clothes and other possessions, but they make the whole experience of packing, unpacking, and actually finding stuff while you’re traveling much easier. They turn your chaotic piles of clothing and supplies into geometric cubes that can be organized individually and removed and replaced in your luggage easily. Because you’re dealing with uniform cubes, popping stuff in and out of your suitcase won’t result in a nervous breakdown, either.\n\nIt’s truly a time to be alive: You can now purchase so-called “basic” economy airline seats that don’t allow a carry-on. And carry-on fees and restrictions are increasing as well. If you’re attempting to travel with just one small bag, you may find it a struggle—and that’s where the pillow hack comes into play. The basic idea is simple: Grab a neck pillow or pillowcase, remove the stuffing, and jam in some extra clothes instead. The pillow can still be used as a pillow (your clothes act as the cushion), but you get to smuggle extra stuff on the plane. It does work, though it works best with the neck pillow option—bringing an enormous pillowcase filled with jeans and T-shirts is going to be less successful fooling unamused flight crews.\n\nEntertaining yourself on long flights can be a challenge, especially if your whole survival plan involved sleeping for ten hours and you can’t seem to get comfortable. If your plane doesn’t offer convenient screens (I’m very fond of the “tiny screen up in the air four rows ahead of me” arrangement, myself), or the entertainment choices available aren’t appealing, you can always load up a device with movies, shows, and games.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck with just your phone for a screen, you can improv a phone holder from the barf bag typically supplied in the pocket of the seat in front of you, as demonstrated here. By clipping the bag between your phone and its case, then clipping the top of the bag under the fold-down tray, you can mount your phone horizontally at the right height for watching content. This could be a real sanity-saver (assuming you don't need to use that bag for, well, other purposes).\n\nYou’re spending money practically every day anyway—but by putting all those expenses on a credit card that awards you miles or points toward travel (and then paying that card off in full every month) you’re essentially getting free travel coupons. You’re going to buy groceries anyway, so why not get a hundred miles every time you do? Many travel credit cards offer large sign-up bonuses of anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 points (or more) once you spend a certain amount on the account, so by paying your everyday bills for a few months using the card you can fund an entire trip for free.\n\nBooking a place to stay on your trip can be a hassle, and you have to wonder if you’re getting the best deal. An Airbnb might look ideal but put a big dent in your budget—but it may be listed elsewhere, and possibly for less money. You can find out using Google’s “reverse image lookup.” Pick a photo from the Airbnb listing, search for the image on Google, and other rental platforms will probably show up—or a link to a hotel’s direct web page. If nothing else, the image search might identify the apartment building or hotel depicted, which can give you a leg up on the pricing. There are also tools like HiChee that will compare listings across several platforms for you, but where’s the fun in that?\n\nYou drag yourself, exhausted, into a hotel room at night and don’t notice that the curtains on the windows are hanging loose. You collapse into bed, and then you’re awakened at 6 a.m. by a vengeful sun, shining through the gaps in those curtains. This hack is so simple, but it can make a big difference in your sleep quality: Take a pants hanger from your hotel closet (the ones with the metal clips) and clip your room’s curtain shut. When the morning sunlight tries to infiltrate your room and wake you up first thing in the morning, the clips will keep it out.\n\nIf you use the safe supplied in your hotel room to store some valuables or your essential travel documents, the worst thing you can do is forget them when you check out. A quick hack to ensure that doesn’t happen is to put something you can’t possibly forget in there as well. Some folks suggest a shoe, figuring that when you’re getting dressed for the next leg of your journey, you’ll definitely notice if one shoe is missing. But this will work with anything, as long as you choose something you can’t possibly leave without.\n\nWe once lived in a world where finding your way around a new area meant paper maps and confusing directions from friends that referenced a lot of fast food restaurants as landmarks. These days, we have access to military-grade GPS systems, and a pleasant computer voice will tell us to turn right in one hundred feet. That’s amazing when you’re traveling in an unfamiliar place—until you lose your internet connection.\n\nA great hack is to download offline maps of your destinations before you leave on your trip. You can do this with Google Maps or using an app like HERE WeGo. This requires some planning, as you have to download the maps while you have a signal, but once you have them downloaded you can use them more or less as you normally would, getting directions and seeing distances clearly. Take a moment to do this before every trip, and you’ll never be lost again.",

    "fullText": "Android users are getting more tools to combat the seemingly endless stream of scam texts from bad actors looking to steal your data and your money. Circle to Search and Google Lens can now assess messages for scam red flags, and if possible fraud is detected, you'll get recommendations for what to do (or not do) next. Even if you think you know the telltale signs of a scam—a sense of urgency, a demand for money or personal information, a link to log in or pay—using these tools can confirm your suspicions, especially when you feel pressured to act.\n\nTo activate Circle to Search, long press the home button or navigation bar on your device and circle the text you want to scan. Alternatively, you can take a screenshot, open Lens in the Google app (also available on iOS), and tap the screenshot. The feature works for text messages as well as communication on messaging apps and social media sites. Google says the capability is available \"when our systems have high confidence in the quality of the response.\"\n\nThis is just the latest in the Google's suite of security features meant to protect against fraud. Pixel users have real-time, AI-powered scam detection, which identifies and alerts you to suspicious conversational patterns in Google Messages and Phone by Google. In-call protections for Android prevent you from taking certain actions, such as sideloading new apps and changing accessibility permission, on your device while on the phone with anyone not saved in your contacts.\n\nEarlier this month, Google also expanded its in-call scam detection feature, meant to combat bank impersonation schemes, to U.S. users. If you are on a call with a number that's not in your contacts and try to open a participating financial app, you'll get a notification reminding you not to share information and a one-click option to stop screen-sharing and end the call.",

    "fullText": "On Friday, Apple dropped iOS 26.2. Despite being the third update in the iOS 26 era, 26.2 still adds some interesting and useful new features, like alarms for reminders and refinements to the Sleep Score on Apple Watch.\n\nUpdates aren't all about the features, however. Apple typically includes a number of security patches with its software releases as well, which makes each update important to install. You don't always need to install the latest version of iOS or macOS to benefit from these security patches, either: Apple usually releases important security patches for some older versions of its software. iPhones running iOS 18 can install the same security patches as those running iOS 26, as can Mac users running macOS Sequoia or Sonoma, rather than Tahoe.\n\nAll that to say, Apple's update today comes with a series of patches you'll want to install on your iPhone—no matter what software version you're currently running. This particular release ships with 25 patches, and while some of them seem only pertinent to software developers, others are plainly serious.\n\nPerhaps most importantly from a security perspective, this release includes two patches for potential zero-day vulnerabilities. Zero-day flaws are especially dangerous as they are either publicly disclosed or actively exploited before a developer has a chance to issue a patch—leaving users vulnerable to attack.\n\nBoth flaws (CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174) affect WebKit, Apple's platform for developing Safari and web browsers on iPhone. Before Apple patched these issues, bad actors could present users with malicious web content. Once the user processes it on their iPhone, it could lead to arbitrary code execution, which, essentially, allows the bad actor to run whatever code they want on your iPhone. Apple says it is aware of reports that these two flaws may have been exploited in \"an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals\" in versions of iOS older than iOS 26.\n\nThis is not the first time Apple has patched flaws with this warning. Due to the iPhone's popularity, these flaws are valuable to governments and other large-scale actors that target high-profile individuals, like journalists and politicians. Apple will even send these users warnings when their iPhone has been identified in such an attack. While the risk is low that the average iPhone user will be targeted in one of these campaigns, it's not impossible, which means it's important to update as soon as a patch is available. These apply to other Apple devices too, like Macs, so update all devices as soon as possible.\n\nWhile those two flaws are the most important of the bunch to fix, there are others here that you'll want to fix ASAP. One of the first to jump out at me was a \"Calling Framework\" flaw that allows bad actors to spoof their FaceTime caller ID. With the rise of AI scams, bad actors could create an AI voice that sounds like someone you know, and spoof their contact so it looks like they're calling you over FaceTime audio. This update patches that possibility—at least, as far as spoofing is concerned.\n\nSpeaking of FaceTime, this update also patches a flaw that sometimes reveals password fields when remotely controlling a device over FaceTime. If you were sharing your screen with someone over a video call, they might be able to see when you typed in your password and use that against you. There's also a patch for an issue that allowed an app to see other apps you had installed on your device—a major privacy and security vulnerability.\n\nIf you use the Photos' app Hidden feature to hide sensitive pictures you don't want others to see, you'll want to install this update ASAP, too: Previous versions of iOS contained a bug that made it possible to view these hidden photos without authentication.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing all of Apple's security patches in this update, the full release notes are as follows:\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: An app may be able to access sensitive payment tokens\n\nDescription: A permissions issue was addressed with additional restrictions.\n\nCVE-2025-46288: floeki, Zhongcheng Li from IES Red Team of ByteDance\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: Processing a file may lead to memory corruption\n\nDescription: The issue was addressed with improved bounds checks.\n\nCVE-2025-43539: Michael Reeves (@IntegralPilot)\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: An attacker may be able to spoof their FaceTime caller ID\n\nDescription: An inconsistent user interface issue was addressed with improved state management.\n\nCVE-2025-46287: an anonymous researcher, Riley Walz\n\nAvailable for: iPhone 11 and later, iPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and later, iPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and later, iPad Air 3rd generation and later, iPad 8th generation and later, and iPad mini 5th generation and later\n\nImpact: Multiple issues in curl\n\nDescription: This is a vulnerability in open source code and Apple Software is among the affected projects.

    "fullText": "The sheer scope of cybercrime can be hard to fathom, even when you live and breathe it every day. It's not just the volume of data, but also the extent to which it replicates across criminal actors seeking to abuse it for their own gain, and to our detriment.\n\nWe were reminded of this recently when the FBI reached out and asked if they could send us 630 million more passwords. For the last four years, they've been sending over passwords found during the course of their investigations in the hope that we can help organisations block them from future use. Back then, we were supporting 1.26 billion searches of the service each month. Now, it's... more:\n\nJust as it's hard to wrap your head around the scale of cybercrime, I find it hard to grasp that number fully. On average, that service is hit nearly 7 thousand times per second, and at peak, it's many times more than that. Every one of those requests is a chance to stop an account takeover. But the real scale goes well beyond the API itself. Because the data model is open source and freely available, many organisations use the Pwned Passwords Downloader to take the entire corpus offline and query it directly within their own applications. That tool alone calls the API around a million times during download, but the resulting data is then queried… well, who knows how many times after that. Pretty cool, right?\n\nThis latest corpus of data came to us as a result of the FBI seizing multiple devices belonging to a suspect. The data appeared to have originated from both the open web and Tor-based marketplaces, Telegram channels and infostealer malware families. We hadn't seen about 7.4% of them in HIBP before, which might sound small, but that's 46 million vulnerable passwords we weren't giving people using the service the opportunity to block. So, we've added those and bumped the prevalence count on the other 584 million we already had.\n\nWe're thrilled to be able to provide this service to the community for free and want to also quickly thank Cloudflare for their support in providing us with the infrastructure to make this possible. Thanks to their edge caching tech, all those passwords are queryable from a location just a handful of milliseconds away from wherever you are on the globe.\n\nIf you're hitting the API, then all the data is already searchable for you. If you're downloading it all offline, go and grab the latest data now. Either way, go forth and put it to good use and help make a cybercriminal's day just that much harder 😊",

    "title": "Google Removes Sci-Hub Domains from U.S. Search Results Due to Dated Court Order",
    "description": "Google has removed dozens of Sci-Hub domain names from its search results in the U.S., marking the country's first pirate domain removals.",
    "fullText": "In 2017, American Chemical Society (ACS), a leading source of academic publications in the field of chemistry, won a lawsuit against Sci-Hub and its operator, Alexandra Elbakyan.\n\nThe ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ had failed to appear at a Virginia federal court, resulting in an easy win for the publisher and a $4.8 million default judgment award for damages.\n\nMore important, perhaps, was the broad permanent injunction that the Virginia federal court signed off on in 2017. This order effectively gave ACS free rein to take down existing and newly registered Sci-Hub domain names.\n\nThe injunction also required all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to “cease facilitating access” to these domain names, including search engines, hosting providers, ISPs, and domain name registrars, the order clarified.\n\nOn paper, this injunction enabled ACS to request American ISPs and search engines to ‘block’ existing and future Sci-Hub domains. However, there was no sign that the publisher was doing so. Aside from a few suspended domains, Sci-Hub remained widely accessible.\n\nWhether ACS did not feel the need to enforce the order against search engines and other intermediaries or if these companies actively objected to the requested actions was unknown. And as time passed, the injunction became a distant memory, at least for a few years.\n\nEarlier this week we spotted a unique request in the Lumen Database, where the 2018 injunction was cited. The notice in question asks Google to deindex 34 (sub)domains linked to Sci-Hub.\n\nNone of these domains were referenced in the 2018 injunction but are indeed linked to Sci-Hub. Many of the partially redacted domains appear to be domain variations of the scihubtw.tw mirror network, such as edu.scihubtw.tw and freeus.scihubtw.tw.\n\nIt’s surprising to see this type of enforcement seven years after the injunction was issued, but the request is legitimate. Google is certainly taking it seriously and has deindexed these domains from its search results in America. In other countries, the same domains remain accessible.\n\nThe December 2 notice was sent by UK law firm Wiggin LLP, which sent a similar request in September this year, targeting a few dozen other Sci-Hub domains. In total, we spotted seven notices, with the earliest dating back to 2022.\n\nThe results of these removals are also clearly visible in Google search. Those who search for Sci-Hub in the U.S. will see the following notice at the bottom of the results.\n\nIt’s not clear why it took five years before ACS urged Google to take action in response to the injunction. However, these removals are similar to Google’s removal of pirate site domains in other countries in response to ISP-blocking orders. Voluntary cooperation by Google was uncovered shortly before ACS first notified the search engine.\n\nGoogle’s voluntary cooperation with ISP blocking orders in Australia, the Netherlands, France, the UK, and elsewhere also brings up an important question. Is Google cooperating with the permanent injunction in the U.S. because it feels legally compelled to do so, or is that a voluntary gesture too?\n\nThe 2018 injunction requires all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to take action. While search engines are mentioned as an example, Google and other tech companies have previously argued that neutral third-party services are not necessarily “in active concert or participation”.\n\nIt is likely that Google maintains this stance, opting to voluntarily comply with orders targeting other third parties. That would mirror its response to site-blocking orders elsewhere.\n\nWe contacted Google hoping to hear answers to these questions, but the company did not respond to our request for comment.",

    "title": "Four Ways to Fix a Slippery Wood Floor",
    "description": "Wood floors can suddenly and inexplicably become super slippery. There are several ways of dealing with it, from temporary sprays to more permanent anti-slip coatings.",
    "fullText": "Recently, a few spots on the hardwood floors in my house have become mysteriously slippery—so slippery that they're kind of dangerous. I really feel like my feet might go out from under me when I walk there, and there were a few close calls before I started avoiding them (or at least bracing myself to walk over them more carefully).\n\nThis is no way to live, so I started looking into solutions, starting with the root cause.\n\nTurns out it’s not uncommon for hardwood floors to become spontaneously slippery, and it can happen for a variety of reasons.\n\nWax or polish: If you apply any kind of coating to give your floor extra shine, it can build up over time and turn the floor into an ice rink.\n\nOil and silicone cleaning products: Some cleaning products that promise a shiny finish contain silicone or oil, which can also build up and turn your floors into a slip-n-slide.\n\nDirt and humidity: Dirt, even the stuff you can’t see, can act as a dry lubricant, and high humidity can result in a moisture slick on the surface of the floors.\n\nTime: Finally, over time, all those feet walking over the floor can polish the finish, removing the microscopic imperfections that previously gave it some grip.\n\nI don’t polish or wax my floors or use oil- or silicone-based cleaners, and I clean pretty regularly, so I discounted the first few causes and assumed that we’ve just polished the seal on our floors with regular foot traffic. This can happen to any sealed wood floor, but there are some pretty straightforward ways to deal with it.\n\nThe first step I took was a thorough cleaning. I clean my floors regularly, but it’s always possible that something spilled without being noticed—the spots where the slipperiness occurred are in the path from the kitchen to the dining room, and from my tool closet to everywhere else in the house. Cooking oils, WD40—there are a lot of things that could have dripped without being noticed. If you’re not sure about substance buildup on a slippery floor, a thorough cleaning might be the easy solution.\n\nAlways use a pH-neutral cleaner designed specifically for wood floors—and never use vinegar, even heavily diluted in water. Vinegar can eat away at the finish of your floor; while it might help with the slipperiness, it can also do some permanent damage. I used Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner and cleaned the areas a few times, but my floors remained slippery.\n\nA simple solution, especially if you’re dealing with one or two isolated slippery spots, is to just throw down a rug or a runner with a non-slip backing. Your floors will still be slippery, but won’t pose any threat. If the slippery area is quite large (or encompasses your entire floor), this might not work because the rugs might just slide around with nothing to grip onto. But for a small slippery area, it might be a quick, easy solution.\n\nIf cleaning and covering up your slippery floors won’t work, there are some more involved solutions to try:\n\nAnti-slip sprays. There are a variety of temporary anti-slip coating sprays you can apply to your floors, like Rustoleum AntiSlip or Slip Doctors Safety Spray. Although the Rustoleum spray is okay for indoor use and wood, it doesn’t specify hardwood floors, and in a quick test it looked slightly cloudy on a remnant plank I had lying around. The Safety Spray, on the other hand, dried very clear, and reduced the slip factor significantly, so I’d recommend it. It does change the sheen of the floor slightly (noticeable in the right light), but it’s also temporary and will need to be re-applied every year or so.\n\nSlip NoMor. This stuff is actually designed for stages and dance floors, but you can use it on any wood floor. I didn’t test this, but the procedure is pretty straightforward: Clean thoroughly first, and dilute it with one part Slip NoMor and 20 parts water. Then mop it on and let dry. The coating will only last a week or so (and you can remove it with hot water at any time), so it’s not a permanent solution unless you’re okay with re-applying every week or so.\n\nCoatings. A longer-lasting and more involved solution is to coat your floors with a clear anti-slip product like Floor Grip, Bona Anti-Slip, or Loba 2K Invisible. These are essentially new finish seals on your floors, and all require you to sand the floor before application and allow them to cure for several days. It’s a DIY solution if you’re comfortable doing the prep work, but it’s not a quick fix.\n\nPaint. If your wood floors are in good condition, this might not be a great idea—but if your floors are a bit worn down, painting them with an anti-slip additive can be a cheap, easy way to eliminate the problem.\n\nIf cleaning and temporary sprays don’t work and you’re considering a coating to fix your slippery floor, you might think about going all-in and having your floors professionally refinished with an anti-slip finish. This will ensure a consistent finish and refresh your floors in the process. It’s the most expensive and disruptive solution, but also the most permanent. Most professional refinishers can suggest an appropriate seal for your floors that will increase traction.",

    "description": "Deno 2.6 introduces deno audit with a new --socket flag that plugs directly into Socket to bring supply chain security checks into the Deno CLI.",
    "fullText": "Deno 2.6 was released this week with new security improvements that make it easier to catch threats before they hit production. The release introduces a new deno audit command that scans your dependencies against GitHub's CVE database, along with granular controls for lifecycle scripts and minimum dependency age requirements.\n\nDeno 2.6 also includes experimental Socket integration through deno audit --socket, which queries Socket's Firewall API to fetch malicious package detections and supply chain risk indicators in real time. While CVE databases catalog vulnerabilities after they've been discovered and reported, Socket's Firewall analyzes package behavior to catch threats as they emerge, things like typosquatting, malicious install scripts, and obfuscated code that slip past traditional scanners.\n\nSocket's supply chain security risk detection is available through two authentication modes:\n\nUnauthenticated mode provides instant security scanning for any Deno project:\n\nAuthenticated mode applies your organization's security policies when SOCKET_API_KEY is set as an environment variable. Teams can enforce company-wide rules and access detailed threat analysis across their entire dependency graph.\n\nTraditional vulnerability scanning relies on CVE databases, which only catch known exploits after they've been reported and cataloged. Socket's approach analyzes package behavior to detect supply chain attacks before they have a chance to hit your codebase.\n\nWith the Socket integration, Deno users get access to our threat detection for free, with continuous tracking of every package and version on npm (and other popular open source registries). Socket has identified and flagged thousands of malicious packages that will never receive CVEs, including attacks like Shai-Hulud, cryptomining campaigns, and the frequent typosquatting attempts targeting popular packages.\n\nDeno 2.6 integrates tsgo for faster typechecking. The team has observed a 2x speed improvement on type checking times for internal projects. The release also includes several security and dependency management features that complement Socket integration:\n\nGranular script control with deno approve-scripts replaces the previous --allow-scripts flag. When installing packages with lifecycle scripts, Deno prompts you to review and approve each package individually. Your choices persist in deno.json, creating an audit trail of which packages can execute code during installation.\n\nDependency age requirements let you specify minimum package ages in deno.json. Setting \"minimumDependencyAge\": \"7 days\" ensures your project only uses dependencies that have been publicly available long enough for the community to identify potential issues.\n\nThe dx command provides an npx-equivalent for running package binaries. While it defaults to full permissions like npx, it prompts before downloading packages and running lifecycle scripts, giving you visibility into what code executes during installation.\n\nCheck out the Deno 2.6 announcement post",

    "description": "As an EV perk comes to an end, solo drivers must exit the HOV lane or face a fine.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nSolo EV drivers using California carpool lanes will face ticketing beginning Monday as the perk disappears.\n\nThough the benefit, courtesy of the California’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal program, technically ended for solo drivers a few months ago, the Department of Motor Vehicles offered a 60-day grace period that ended Monday. Now, solo drivers face fines of up to $490.\n\nWith this, most carpool lanes require vehicles with more than two people.\n\nAs of Aug. 14, more than half a million motorists statewide had an active decal on their vehicle to access carpool lanes. California has an estimated 1,171 carpool lane-miles, with 803 miles in Southern California and 366 miles in Northern California, according to a UC Berkeley study.\n\nWith more than 35 million total registered vehicles in California, that means 1% to 2% of the vehicle fleet will lose access to the carpool lane, said Antonio Bento, professor of public policy and economics at USC.\n\nExperts say the impact for commuters will be minimal with all the solo EV vehicles returning to the general lanes because traffic is already terrible, according to experts.\n\nFederal legislation has allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to grant solo drivers in low-emission and energy-efficient cars to use the carpool, or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV), lane.\n\nThe goal was to promote the adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles and assist in meeting environmental goals that included reducing fuel consumption and pollution caused by congested freeways, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nOver time, states developed incentive programs, choosing which car models to give carpool access to.\n\nCalifornia is one of 13 states that offered this type of incentive program to its residents. Qualified drivers in the Golden State include those who drive fuel cell electric, natural gas or plug-in electric cars.\n\nIn 2015, Congress authorized California’s program through a highway funding bill, but that authorization expired Sept. 30.\n\nIn an effort to extend the decal program, state Assemblymember Greg Wallis (R-Bermuda Dunes) wrote Assembly Bill 2678, which would push the end date to Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year.\n\nBut the change never got the required federal approval so the extension was moot.",

    "title": "I Tried the New Sunscreen Ingredient the FDA Is Finally Approving After Over 20 Years",
    "description": "We're about to get sunscreens that are safer, more effective, and less goopy.",
    "fullText": "Some unexpected good news from the FDA: bemotrizinol, a sunscreen ingredient that has been used in Europe and Asia for decades, is finally being added to the allowable ingredients list for products sold in the U.S. Bemotrizinol is the active ingredient in sunscreens like Bioré Watery Essence, which has a cult following for being unlike anything we can get in the U.S.\n\nI’ve tried Bioré UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence (that’s the full name of the product) in its original Japanese formulation. This sunscreen is a cult favorite on skincare and Asian beauty forums because of its non-greasy feel, and because it protects against both UVA and UVB rays without leaving a white cast. I got mine from a friend who had either picked it up while traveling or possibly ordered from overseas; you can’t buy it in U.S.-based stores.\n\nI’ll explain why this is below, but first: it truly is nothing like anything we have locally. Even our most “non-greasy” sunscreens tend to feel a little goopy or sticky. This one really feels like nothing after you rub it in. I instantly understood why it’s so sought-after. Remembering that experience, I’m looking forward to what we might see in American sunscreens once manufacturers are allowed to include this ingredient.\n\nBemotrizinol has a lot of things going for it. One is that it “plays well with other sunscreen ingredients,” as one dermatologist told Women’s Health. You can make lighter, nicer-feeling sunscreens with it, hence the popularity of the Bioré formulation I tried. To see what I mean, check out this video where a dermatologist shows off the differences between Bioré's Japanese formulation and the version it sells in the U.S. The ingredients are different, and the texture just isn't the same.\n\nIt’s also more effective at broad-spectrum protection. With our current sunscreen formulations, all active ingredients protect against UVB rays (the rays that cause sunburn) but only a few can also provide protection against UVA rays (which contribute to wrinkling and aging of skin). UVB is considered to be the bigger risk for skin cancer, but both probably contribute to cancer risk. Right now, most broad-spectrum U.S. sunscreens use mineral components like zinc oxide. Mineral sunscreens work pretty well, but can leave a white cast on your skin when applied as thickly as you’re supposed to.\n\nBemotrizinol is a chemical UV filter, so it doesn’t leave that white cast. But it protects well against UVA rays in addition to UVB, and it’s more photostable than a lot of our existing chemical sunscreen ingredients so it can last longer on the skin. In other words, it’s a chemical sunscreen, but combines some of the best features of both chemical and mineral sunscreens.\n\nIt’s also considered to be one of the safest sunscreens. All sunscreens on the market are much safer than going without sunscreen, but all of our chemical sunscreen ingredients are currently undergoing a safety evaluation because regulators determined they are probably fine but need more research to know for sure. Currently only our two mineral sunscreen ingredients (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) are considered GRAS, or generally recognized as safe and effective. Bemotrizinol will be the third.\n\nIf you're looking at ingredient lists on Asian or European sunscreens, be aware that it goes by several names. Tinosorb S is bemotrizinol; so is bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine.\n\nAsk anyone in the skincare world what they think about U.S. sunscreens, and for decades now you’d get complaints that we’re missing out on the best sunscreens that the rest of the world uses. (Our last new sunscreen ingredient was approved in 1996.) In most countries, sunscreens are regulated as cosmetics, but in the U.S. they are regulated as drugs. That means the U.S. requires more rigorous testing and approval.\n\nThe CARES act, passed in 2020 for pandemic relief, provided a way for over-the-counter drugs to be sold without going through the complete approval process, so long as the FDA was satisfied they were safe and effective. Bemotrizinol met the criteria, thanks in large part to the fact that it’s been used safely since 2000 in Europe, Asia, and Australia. The FDA’s rule on bemotrizinol still needs to be finalized, but it seems likely we’ll see new sunscreens on shelves before the end of 2026.",

    "description": "Animated animals, bouncing balls, and timers turn quiet time into a game.",
    "fullText": "Whether you're a teacher, a parent, or just someone with a big family, you know how difficult it can be to keep a room full of kids quiet for any amount of time.\n\nOne trick I've used is offering to time how long kids can stay quiet. For reasons I don't understand, kids love it when something is being timed. But that only work a few times at the most, so it's good to have as many other tricks on hand as possible. That's why I was fascinated to learn there are multiple websites that use the microphone on your laptop to motivate kids to be quiet. Some put children's curiosity to work, having animated characters show up if the group is quiet for long enough. Others combine animation with good old-fashioned timers.\n\nHere are a few you can check out—all of them are completely free and don't require anything more than your browser.\n\nSilent Forest shows a simple animated forest with a volume indicator. Stay silent for a bit and a cat shows up. A bit longer and a bear shows up. Who else might join? There's only one way to find out. Make too much noise, though, and you'll scare the animals, meaning you have to start over if you ever want to see everyone. The idea is that the kids will be curious to see which animals will show up next and keep quiet—and, ideally, pressure each other into staying quiet.\n\nBouncy Balls fills your screen with balls—options include colored balls, emojis, numbered balls, eyeballs, and even bubbles. The balls are constantly vibrating, threatening to explode with a bit of noise—which they do. There's a risk of this backfiring—it's sincerely very fun to see the balls bounce—which you can mitigate by enabling a shushing or beeping sound after any violation.\n\nClassroom Zen offers a few different tools for keeping the room quiet. Two feature Ruby, a cartoon who is meditating in either the mountains or the desert. If the room gets too loud, her eyes will start opening—keep going and she'll ask the room to be quiet. Another features Milo, a three-eyed monster who is trying to sleep.\n\nThe secret sauce here, though, is the timer at the top of the screen. This means you can tell the kids they need to be quiet for a certain amount of time and have a timer to enforce that.",

    "fullText": "Auchinleck Talbot have taken the \"difficult and extremely disappointing\" decision to move their Scottish Cup fourth round tie against Celtic to Kilmarnock's Rugby Park.\n\nThe West of Scotland League Premier Division side say there were concerns over whether surrounding infrastructure could cope with such a high-profile event, having taken advice from the Scottish FA and Police Scotland.\n\nThe Ayrshire club's Beechwood Park ground holds 4,000 people, compared to the 15,000-capacity stadium 15 miles up the A76.\n\nThe tie between the sixth-tier outfit and the 42-time champions will take place on Sunday, 18 January and will be broadcast live on Premier Sports.\n\nIn a statement, Auchinleck Talbot said: \"Following various meetings and lengthy discussions involving East Ayrshire Council, Police Scotland, and the Scottish Football Association, the club has taken the difficult and extremely disappointing decision to relocate our Men's Scottish Cup fourth round tie against Celtic to Rugby Park.\n\n\"Although Beechwood Park meets and goes beyond the SFA Club Licensing Entry Level criteria in certain areas, various concerns the club could not ignore arose in relation to the ability of the surrounding infrastructure to cope with such a high-profile event that has brought worldwide interest to the village of Auchinleck and Auchinleck Talbot F.C.\n\n\"The club thanks East Ayrshire Council Events & Resilience, Police Scotland, Scottish Football Association, Celtic F.C. & Kilmarnock F.C. for their input and assistance during this process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, BBC Scotland will broadcast two fourth-round ties.\n\nDunfermline welcome Hibernian to East End Park live on BBC One Scotland on Saturday, 17 January (12:30 GMT), while Aberdeen host Raith Rovers on the same channel on Sunday, 18 January (14:30 GMT).",

    "fullText": "Glasgow Warriors going up against the mighty Toulouse at Scotstoun on Saturday might well be the match of the weekend in round two of the Champions Cup.\n\nThe six-time European champions are as close to rugby's version of Real Madrid as you will find, and like the Spanish footballing giants in their 'Galacticos' era, they are stacked with world-class stars.\n\nChief among them is incredible France scrum-half Antoine Dupont, who most would agree is the world's best player. Some would argue he is the game's greatest ever.\n\n\"Everyone sees it, whenever he plays, he makes a massive difference to not only Toulouse, but to the French squad as well,\" said Glasgow Warriors' Ollie Smith, who will start on the wing at Scotstoun.\n\n\"I think he has a lot of firepower and it doesn't matter if he's on the back foot or the front foot, he seems to create things and see space that no-one else sees. He always seems to pop up in the right position, so he's definitely going to be difficult to play against.\n\n\"But rather than being worried about playing such a formidable team, I think you have to get excited and put your best foot forward and almost stun them, surprise them with what we can do, because we're confident as a group that we can put in a performance that deserves a win.\"",

I think we had enough to win today.\n\n\"We talked in the week about belief, being aggressive and taking the game to them and I think we did that in the first half. We executed our game plan brilliantly and had the lead at half-time with two moments of magic.\n\n\"I don't know what it was, we just ran out of steam and our discipline let us down.\n\n\"We said at the end in the huddle that if we don't believe now that we're good enough, then I don't know what we need, because that's one of the best teams in club rugby in the world and we've gone toe-to-toe with them.\n\n\"We can be proud of our fight and our effort, but that's not good enough - we want to go beyond that now. We've got the fight and the effort, now we need to go and win games, but it's definitely there, which is good.\"\n\nTigers head coach Geoff Parling told Premier Sports:\n\n\"I'm proud of the way the group stood up for each other.\n\n\"I didn't think things went for us in the game. We've just got to learn that when we feel we're not getting the calls we deserve, what can we do to really tighten up and be more accurate in what we do?\n\n\"We had 37% territory in that game, so we played a lot in our half. I thought we defended so well for each other, but you saw at the top level of the game that one little moment where a ball kicks out of a scrum, that's the difference between winning and losing.\n\n\"The young lads I've got here continue to surprise me with the way they work for each other and step up. As long as we learn from what we doing, we're certainly not dead in the competition. There are two games to come and we know how this competition works.\"\n\nLeinster head coach Leo Cullen told Premier Sports:\n\n\"I thought we started the game really well with great intent. We had a lot of opportunities but we didn't quite take them.\n\n\"You have to give the lads a huge amount of credit, it was an unbelievably composed dressing room at half-time.\n\n\"It's difficult to play here. Leicester are incredibly dogged in everything they do.\n\n\"I thought we showed good composure to come away with a win, because it wasn't perfect, but the lads managed to find a way to get the scores at important times of the game.\"\n\nBoth sides will play their final two pool matches in January. Leicester face Bayonne at home and Stormers away, while Leinster host La Rochelle before visiting Bayonne.\n\nThe Tigers' next game is a home Prem fixture against Gloucester on Friday, 19 December - the same day on which Leinster return to URC action at home to Ulster.\n\nLeicester: Steward; Radwan, Wand, Kata, Hassell-Collins; Searle, Whiteley; Smith, Blamire, Heyes, Henderson, Wells, Thompson, Reffell (capt), Moro.\n\nReplacements: Theobald-Thomas, Van der Flier, Hurd, Manz, Williams, Allan, Bailey, Woodward.\n\nLeinster: J O'Brien; T O'Brien, Ioane, Henshaw, Lowe; Byrne, Gibson-Park; McCarthy, Kelleher, Clarkson, McCarthy, Ryan, Conan, Van der Flier, Doris.\n\nReplacements: Sheehan, Boyle, Slimani, Mangan, Deegan, McGrath, Prendergast, Frawley.\n\nReferee: Pierre Brousset (France)\n\nAssistant referees: Vincent Blasco Baque (France) and Julien Caulier (France)",

    "fullText": "DORAL, Fla. (AP) — A U.S. Navy admiral who oversees military operations in Latin America handed off command responsibilities Friday as scrutiny increases over the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats in the region.\n\nAdm. Alvin Holsey has retired one year into a posting that typically lasts three to four years and transferred leadership duties to his top military deputy, Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Pettus, during a ceremony at U.S. Southern Command headquarters near Miami.\n\nIn farewell remarks, Holsey did not mention the military operations or the reasons for his early retirement. But he urged his successor to uphold longstanding partnerships in the region by standing firmly behind the shared values of democracy and support for the rule of law.\n\n“To be a trusted partner, we must be credible, present and engaged,” Holsey said.\n\nHolsey’s shock retirement was announced by the Pentagon in October, over a month into the Trump administration’s strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 87 people. With the campaign facing growing scrutiny by Congress, Holsey briefed key lawmakers earlier this week.\n\nLong-term replacement for Holsey hasn't yet been named\n\nThe ceremony Friday was more subdued than past retirements, held outdoors amid a small crowd of mostly Southern Command staff and without Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, because President Donald Trump has yet to nominate Holsey’s replacement.\n\nGen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made no mention of the military operations in Latin America as he thanked Holsey for his 37 years of service. Caine referred to Holsey as a “stoic” leader and “quiet professional” who always leads with his heart and head.\n\n“It’s never been about you, it’s been about people, it’s been about others,” Caine said. “You’ve never said ‘I’ in all the conversations we’ve had. You’ve always said ‘we.’ … The impact you’ve had will last for a long time.”\n\nHolsey is departing as Congress is scrutinizing the boat attacks, including one that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of an initial strike. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Hegseth and other top officials have given classified briefings on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nHolsey also spoke this week to key lawmakers overseeing the U.S. military by classified video call. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said afterward that Holsey answered senators’ questions but that “there are still many questions to be answered.” Reed later added that Holsey did not give a reason for his retirement other than saying it was a personal decision.\n\nExperts in the rules of warfare, human rights groups and even some of Trump's allies in Congress have questioned the legality of the attacks on those accused of ferrying drugs. For decades, they were arrested at sea by the Coast Guard and brought to the U.S. for criminal prosecution.\n\nThe 22 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels are being supported by a giant flotilla of U.S. warships, attack helicopters, thousands of troops and even the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nTrump's Republican administration has defended its aggressive tactics, designating several drug cartels in Latin America as foreign terrorist organizations and declaring that the U.S. is in armed conflict with those criminal organizations, relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nThe campaign has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. In a sharp escalation Wednesday, U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration has accused of smuggling illicit crude. Sale of that oil on global energy markets is critical to Maduro’s grip on power.\n\nMaduro has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office.\n\nHolsey’s departure is the latest in a long line of sudden retirements and firings that have befallen the military’s top ranks since Hegseth took charge of the Pentagon.\n\nA native of rural Fort Valley, Georgia, whose father and several uncles served in Vietnam, Holsey relinquished his command to Pettus to a soulful rendition of “Midnight Train to Georgia.”\n\nPettus, a fighter jet pilot with combat experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, had been serving as Holsey’s top deputy since late 2024. However, it’s unclear how long the Arkansas native will remain in the job. Whomever Trump nominates must be confirmed by the Senate.",

    "description": "“She owns two houses and lives with a disabled son.”",
    "fullText": "Can you work a minimum wage job and retire with $2 million?\n\nA gentleman reader asks this question: “We read news about some people making six-figure incomes while living paycheck to paycheck. My Taiwanese friend moved here, couldn’t read or write English, married an American GI, moved to Texas, worked at Walmart for minimum wage — worked for almost 60 years — and retired a few years ago only because her husband got sick. At 87, her stock portfolio is about $2 million. She owns two houses and lives with a disabled son. Her husband also had mental-health issues, so she couldn’t rely on him.” It’s possible she did this with seed money from her husband and, yes, it’s possible that she did this without it.\n\n‘This feels like an opportunity’: I’m 55, earn $78,000 and have no kids. My mother gave me $10,000. What should I do?\n\nMy Taiwanese immigrant friend started working in Walmart for minimum wage and retired with $2 million. What was her secret?\n\nInvestors fear Time just jinxed the AI stock-market rally with its 2025 person of the year\n\nThere are a few weeks left to supersize your Roth conversion without raising your tax bill\n\nLiving paycheck to paycheck means different things for different people. For someone earning $100,000 or $200,000 a year who is living paycheck to paycheck, they are probably balancing their books (tightly) every month because they are also contributing 6% of their salary to their 401(k) or IRA; 30% on mortgage payments (rather than rent) so they will benefit from the increase in value of their property over the lifetime of the mortgage); and thousands of dollars into their children’s tax-advantaged college 529 plans — in addition to the monthly food, transport, vacation, leisure, gym and utilities expenses.\n\nAs Americans try to navigate (or wait) their way out of the current “affordability crisis,” six-figure earners are making up for a much larger share of consumer spending. In fact, the top 10% of earners — those households making about $250,000 a year or more — have made huge gains in recent years because of the prolonged bull market and increases in their real estate and other assets. They account for nearly 50% of all spending, up from 36% three decades ago, according to Moody’s Analytics data published by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHis Taiwanese friend, given what he says about her early years and the fact that she could not rely on her husband to boost her financial security, could have been one Walmart WMT pink slip away from being on the street, if she did not have a wealthy family as a social safety net. What’s more, she may also have been sending money home to her own family of origin. This is the stuff that the American Dream is made of, but first-generation immigrants also have language barriers that can restrict their work-life prospects.",

    "fullText": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The United States is using its economic power to “assert its will\" and threaten military force against friend and foe alike, a Danish intelligence agency said in a new report.\n\nThe Danish Defense Intelligence Service, in its latest annual assessment, said Washington's greater assertiveness under the Trump administration also comes as China and Russia seek to diminish Western, especially American, influence.\n\nPerhaps most sensitive to Denmark — a NATO and European Union member country, and a U.S. ally — is growing competition between those great powers in the Arctic. U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to see Greenland, a semiautonomous and mineral-rich territory of Denmark, become part of the United States, a move opposed by Russia and much of Europe.\n\n“The strategic importance of the Arctic is rising as the conflict between Russia and the West intensifies, and the growing security and strategic focus on the Arctic by the United States will further accelerate these developments,” said the report, published Wednesday.\n\nThe assessment also follows the release last week of a new Trump administration national security strategy that depicts European allies as weak and aims to reassert America’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia is worried about NATO’s activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its military capability in the polar region.\n\nThe findings and analyses in the report echo a string of recent concerns, notably in Western Europe, about an increasingly go-it-alone approach by the United States, which under Trump's second term has favored bilateral deals and partnerships at the expense of multilateral alliances like NATO.\n\n“For many countries outside the West, it has become a viable option to forge strategic agreements with China rather than the United States,” read the report, which was written in Danish. “China and Russia, together with other like-minded states, are seeking to reduce Western – and particularly US – global influence.”\n\n“At the same time, uncertainty has grown over how the United States will prioritize its resources in the future,” it added. “This gives regional powers greater room for maneuver, enabling them to choose between the United States and China or to strike a balance between the two.”\n\nThe Trump administration has raised concerns about respect for international law with its series of deadly strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean — part of a stepped-up pressure campaign against President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela.\n\nTrump has also refused to rule out military force in Greenland, where the United States already has a military base.\n\n“The United States is leveraging economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to assert its will, and the possibility of employing military force – even against allies – is no longer ruled out,” the report said.",

    "description": "A tomb beneath Petra’s Treasury reveals 12 skeletons and 2,000-year-old artifacts. Archaeologists call it a rare find, unlocking secrets of the Nabataeans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA new tomb was discovered at Petra’s Khazneh, one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nThe tomb’s discovery, as revealed on Discovery Channel’s “Expedition Unknown,” also included 12 skeletons from over 2,000 years ago.\n\nIn addition to being a true archaeological marvel, the ornate facade of Jordan’s ancient city of Petra has served as a backdrop in a number of movies, including “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.”\n\nThe sandstone cliff faces of the ancient city of Petra (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World) have long been in the archaeological limelight. They’ve even spent time in the Hollywood limelight as the location for several scenes in the film Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But in a recent on-screen appearance—and no offense to Harrison Ford’s iconic professor—they were the site of a very real discovery.\n\nDiscovery Channel’s popular show “Expedition Unknown” was on site to document the discovery of 12 human skeletons and artifacts dating back at least 2,000 years, which had all been long hidden beneath the famed Khazneh (or “Treasury”) in Petra. The colossal find was accomplished by a team lead by archaeologist Pearce Paul Creasman.\n\nIt’s a find that, were he real, Indiana Jones would certainly be proud of.\n\n“This is a hugely rare discovery,” said Josh Gates, host of the Discovery Channel’s program, according to CNN. “In the two centuries that Petra has been investigated by archaeologists, nothing like this has been found before. Even in front of one of the most famous buildings in the world … there are still huge discoveries to be made.”\n\nCreasman, executive director of the American Center of Research, employed ground-penetrating radar to first see if it was possibile that additional tombs were located at the site. The gathered data matched up to data collected from areas where tombs had been found in the past, and the Jordan government gave the approval for excavation beneath the world-famous site.\n\nThe team was beyond pleased to see an actual tomb materialize, and truly shocked by the fact that it was full of remains and artifacts—many of the tombs at the ancient city have been found empty, picked clean long ago.\n\nAlong with the 12 sets of skeletal remains—several of the bones from which had mold, thanks to the porous sandstone allowing moisture into the space in the flood-prone area—the team found a mix of bronze, iron, and ceramic artifacts. This included one ceramic chalice tucked in the arms of one of the deceased, ironically reminiscent of the “Holy Grail” depicted in The Last Crusade. “It really was this awesome moment,” Gates said, “of history imitating art.”\n\nThe Treasury, located near the main entrance to the city, is believed to be at least 2,000 years old. It is a striking mausoleum carved into the sandstone cliffs that has long attracted tourists aplenty, but dating this iconic monument has proven difficult because of the lack of finds within the tombs.\n\n“We were hopeful to find anything that might tell us more about the ancient people and place,” Creasman said. For instance, Gates believes that the individuals buried in the newly discovered tomb show must have been of very high status because of the prime real estate used for the burial place.“Human remains,” Creasman continued, “can be a really valuable tool in that regard. The burials in this tomb are articulated, so the bones haven’t been rummaged around and moved, so that’s exceedingly rare.”\n\nDelving deeper into the remains and artifacts found in the tomb could open additional information about the Khazneh, Petra, and the lives of the Nabataeans who once inhabited the area. “I think learning who they are,” Gates said, “is really going to help unlock part of the story of the Treasury.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director, a federal judge said Friday.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly represents not only a stern rebuke of the conduct of Justice Department prosecutors but also imposes a dramatic hurdle to government efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey after an initial one was dismissed last month.\n\nThe order concerns computer files and communications that investigators obtained years earlier from Daniel Richman, a Comey friend and Columbia University law professor, as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges. The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.\n\nRichman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.\n\nThe Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.\n\n“When the Government violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person’s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government’s unlawful intrusion?” the judge wrote.\n\nOne answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with the Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation has been based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Comey used Richman to share information with the news media about his decision-making during the FBI’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.\n\nThat indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.\n\nThe Comey saga has a long history.\n\nIn June 2017, one month after Comey was fired as FBI director, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter.\n\nAfter that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer. He authorized the FBI to conduct a search for limited purposes, the judge noted.\n\nThen, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded in 2021 without charges. Those warrants were limited in scope, but Richman has alleged that the government collected more information than the warrants allowed, including personal medial information and sensitive correspondence.\n\nIn addition, Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.\n\n“The Court further concludes that the Government’s retention of Petitioner Richman’s files amounts to an ongoing unreasonable seizure,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “Therefore, the Court agrees with Petitioner Richman that the Government has violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.”",

    "fullText": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — In the age of dinosaurs — before whales, great whites or the bus-sized megalodon — a monstrous shark prowled the waters off what's now northern Australia, among the sea monsters of the Cretaceous period.\n\nResearchers studying huge vertebrae discovered on a beach near the city of Darwin say the creature is now the earliest known mega-predator of the modern shark lineage, living 15 million years earlier than enormous sharks found before.\n\nAnd it was huge. The ancestor of today’s 6-meter (20-foot) great white shark was thought to be about 8 meters (26 feet) long, the authors of a paper published in the journal Communications Biology said.\n\n“Cardabiodontids were ancient, mega-predatory sharks that are very, very common from the later part of the Cretaceous, after 100 million years ago,” said Benjamin Kear, the senior curator in paleobiology at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and one of the study’s authors. “But this has pushed the time envelope back of when we’re going to find absolutely enormous cardabiodontids.”\n\nRediscovered fossils pointed to a huge shark\n\nSharks have a 400-million-year history but lamniforms, the ancestors of today’s great white sharks, appear in the fossil record from 135 million years ago. At that time they were small — probably only a meter in length — which made the discovery that lamniforms had already become gigantic by 115 million years ago an unexpected one for researchers.\n\nThe vertebrae were found on coastline near Darwin in Australia’s far north, once mud from the floor of an ancient ocean that stretched from Gondwana — now Australia — to Laurasia, which is now Europe. It’s a region rich in fossil evidence of prehistoric marine life, with long-necked plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs among the creatures discovered so far.\n\nThe five vertebrae that launched the quest to estimate the size of their mega-shark owners were not a recent discovery, but an older one that had been somewhat overlooked, Kear said. Unearthed in the late 1980s and 1990s, the fossils measured 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) across and had been stored in a museum for years.\n\nWhen studying ancient sharks, vertebrae are prizes for paleontologists. Shark skeletons are made of cartilage, not bone, and their fossil record is mostly made up of teeth, which sharks shed throughout their lives.\n\n“The importance of vertebrae is they give us hints about size,” Kear said. “If you’re trying to scale it from teeth, it’s difficult. Are the teeth big and the bodies small? Are they big teeth with big bodies?”\n\nAncient shark size still holds mystery\n\nScientists have used mathematical formulas to estimate the size of extinct sharks like megalodon, a massive predator that came later and may have reached 17 meters (56 feet) in length, Kear said. But the rarity of vertebrae mean questions of ancient shark size are difficult to answer, he added.\n\nThe international research team spent years testing different ways to estimate the size of the Darwin cardabiodontids, using fisheries data, CT scans and mathematical models, Kear said. Eventually, they arrived at a likely portrait of the predator’s size and shape.\n\n“It would’ve looked for all the world like a modern, gigantic shark, because this is the beauty of it,” Kear said. “This is a body model that has worked for 115 million years, like an evolutionary success story.”\n\nA predator’s past could hint at the future\n\nThe study of the Darwin sharks suggested that modern sharks rose early in their adaptive evolution to the top of prehistoric food chains, the researchers said. Now, scientists could scour similar environments worldwide for others, Kear said.\n\n“They must have been around before,” he said. “This thing had ancestors.”\n\nStudying ancient ecosystems like this one could help researchers understand how today’s species might respond to environmental change, Kear added.\n\n“This is where our modern world begins,” he said. “By looking at what happened during past shifts in climate and biodiversity, we can get a better sense of what might come next.”",

    "fullText": "When you're shopping for a car, that new car smell and shiny paint job can make any vehicle seem like a winner. But the real test comes years down the road when you're wondering whether you'll make it to work or spend the morning waiting for a tow truck.\n\nConsumer Reports recently released findings from their extensive reliability study, surveying owners of vehicles between 5 and 10 years old to see which brands still have owners smiling and which ones have them speed-dialing their mechanic. The results reveal some expected champions, a few surprises, and some brands that might make you think twice before signing on the dotted line.\n\nIt's time to look into which automakers are building cars that go the distance and which ones might leave you stranded.\n\nThese are the car brands at the top of the list, starting with some pretty familiar faces in the \"reliability\" discussion. However, the last one is a bit of a shocker.\n\nLexus takes the crown as the most reliable brand in the entire study, and honestly, is anyone surprised? Toyota's luxury division has been dominating reliability rankings for so long that it's almost boring at this point.\n\nOwners of 5 to 10-year-old Lexus vehicles report fewer problems than any other brand, which explains why you still see older ES and RX models cruising around like they just rolled off the showroom floor. The brand's obsessive attention to detail and conservative engineering approach means you're more likely to get tired of your Lexus than it is to get tired of running.\n\nIf reliability is your top priority and you can stretch your budget to the luxury segment, Lexus remains the gold standard.\n\nRight behind its luxury sibling sits Toyota, proving that reliability runs in the family. The Japanese automaker has built its entire reputation on making vehicles that simply refuse to quit, and the data from owners backs that up year after year.\n\nModels like the Camry, Corolla, and RAV4 have become synonymous with worry-free ownership, racking up hundreds of thousands of miles without breaking a sweat. Toyota's approach to introducing new technology slowly and testing everything thoroughly might not win style points with the cutting-edge crowd, but it certainly wins the long game.\n\nWhen you buy a Toyota, you're essentially purchasing peace of mind wrapped in sheet metal.\n\nMazda often flies under the radar in reliability discussions, but owners of 5 to 10-year-old Mazdas know something that deserves more attention. The brand manages to deliver engaging driving dynamics without sacrificing dependability, which is a rare combination in today's market.\n\nWhile other manufacturers chase flashy technology and complicated powertrains, Mazda sticks to well-engineered fundamentals that actually work for the long haul. Their Skyactiv engines and transmissions have proven themselves as workhorses that keep running with minimal drama.\n\nIf you want a car that's fun to drive and won't leave you stranded, Mazda deserves serious consideration.\n\nHonda has been America's reliable best friend for decades, and the feedback from owners of older vehicles shows that reputation is well-earned. The Civic and Accord have become automotive institutions precisely because they deliver year after year without requiring a second mortgage to maintain.\n\nHonda's engineering philosophy focuses on efficiency and durability, creating powertrains that are known for running smoothly well past 200,000 miles. While the brand has stumbled occasionally with transmission issues in certain model years, the overall picture remains strong.\n\nFor practical transportation that won't let you down, Honda continues to be one of the safest bets in the automotive world.\n\nAcura proves that Honda's reliability DNA translates beautifully to the premium segment, landing solidly in the top tier for long-term dependability. Owners of 5 to 10-year-old Acura models enjoy many of the luxury features found in pricier European brands without the headache-inducing repair costs.\n\nThe MDX and TLX offer refined driving experiences backed by Honda's legendary engineering, creating a sweet spot for buyers who want more upscale transportation without sacrificing peace of mind. While Acura might not carry the prestige badge of some German rivals, your wallet will thank you when that check engine light stays off.\n\nSometimes the smartest luxury choice is the one that doesn't require your mechanic's kids to go to college on your dime.\n\nBMW landing in the top six for long-term reliability might raise some eyebrows, especially given the brand's reputation for expensive maintenance. However, owners of 5 to 10-year-old BMW models report better-than-expected experiences, suggesting the brand has made genuine improvements in dependability.\n\nThe German automaker has worked hard to address some of the reliability issues that plagued earlier generations, and the data shows those efforts are paying off. That said, owning an older BMW still requires a commitment to proper maintenance and a budget for premium parts.\n\nIf you're prepared for higher ownership costs and follow the maintenance schedule religiously, a BMW can deliver the driving excitement it promises without completely draining your bank account.\n\nThese are the automakers that landed on the bottom of the list, which had 26 total brands. While some are head scratchers, the last two are probably the usual suspects you expected to see.\n\nKia has made impressive strides in design and features over the past decade, but according to owners of 5 to 10-year-old vehicles, reliability remains a challenge for the Korean brand. While Kia offers compelling value and generous warranties, the feedback suggests that some models struggle to maintain their initial quality as the miles add up.\n\nThe brand's rapid expansion and introduction of new technology may have contributed to reliability issues that become apparent only after years of ownership. Kia's newer models may fare better as the company continues to refine its engineering, but buyers of older used Kias should budget for potential repairs.\n\nThe 10-year warranty is great, but it only helps if you're the original owner.\n\nGMC positions itself as the premium truck and SUV brand within General Motors, but owners of 5 to 10-year-old GMC vehicles report more issues than you'd expect from vehicles in this price range. The brand shares many components with Chevrolet, yet somehow manages to land lower in reliability rankings, which raises questions about value proposition.\n\nCommon complaints from owners include transmission issues, electrical problems, and various engine-related concerns that can be expensive to address. GMC builds capable trucks and SUVs with impressive towing capacity, but the reliability data suggests you might be visiting your dealer's service department more often than you'd like.\n\nFor buyers considering a used GMC, a thorough pre-purchase inspection is essential.\n\nChrysler's position near the bottom of reliability rankings reflects ongoing struggles that have plagued the brand for years. Owners of 5 to 10-year-old Chrysler vehicles report a range of issues from transmission problems to electrical gremlins that seem to pop up with frustrating regularity.\n\nThe brand's limited lineup means that reliability problems in one or two models have an outsized impact on the overall perception. While Chrysler vehicles often start strong with attractive styling and comfortable interiors, the long-term ownership experience hasn't matched that initial appeal.\n\nFor buyers shopping used Chryslers, the lower purchase prices might seem tempting, but factoring in potential repair costs is crucial for making an informed decision.\n\nRam has carved out a strong reputation for building trucks with excellent ride quality and impressive interiors, but reliability data from owners of 5 to 10-year-old models tells a concerning story. Issues ranging from electrical problems to powertrain concerns appear more frequently than truck buyers would hope for from vehicles designed for hard work.\n\nThe Ram 1500 has won numerous awards for its innovations and comfort, yet these accolades don't always translate into worry-free ownership down the road. Ram trucks can certainly handle demanding tasks, but owners should be prepared for more frequent service appointments than they might experience with some competitors.\n\nIf you're considering a used Ram, finding one with detailed maintenance records becomes especially important.\n\nJeep vehicles are built to handle off-road adventures and challenging terrain, but according to owners of 5 to 10-year-old models, they sometimes struggle with everyday reliability. The brand's focus on capability and ruggedness hasn't always translated into dependable long-term ownership, with various models reporting issues from electrical problems to engine concerns.\n\nJeep's popularity means there's a large community of owners willing to overlook reliability quirks for the brand's unique character and capability. However, buyers should go in with eyes open, knowing that keeping an older Jeep running might require more patience and money than mainstream alternatives.\n\nThe Jeep wave is fun, but the wave goodbye to your paycheck at the repair shop is less enjoyable.\n\nTesla lands at the very bottom of the reliability rankings, which might surprise fans of the electric vehicle pioneer but doesn't shock those who've followed owner feedback over the years. While Tesla has revolutionized the automotive industry with cutting-edge technology and impressive performance, owners of 5 to 10-year-old models report the most problems of any brand in the study.\n\nIssues range from build quality concerns to problems with complex electrical systems and the various tech features that make Teslas unique. The company's rapid innovation and direct-to-consumer model mean that some traditional quality control processes may get bypassed in the rush to market.\n\nTesla builds exciting vehicles that point toward the automotive future, but the current reality involves more service appointments than many owners anticipated.\n\nThe reliability gap between the best and worst performers in this Consumer Reports study reveals just how much brand choice matters for long-term satisfaction. Japanese brands continue to dominate the reliability conversation, with Lexus and Toyota leading the way through proven engineering and meticulous quality control.\n\nMeanwhile, several American brands struggle with the fundamentals, suggesting that flashy features and bold marketing don't automatically translate into dependable transportation. The data from real owners of 5 to 10-year-old vehicles provides valuable insight that goes beyond initial reviews and first impressions.\n\nWhether you're shopping for a new car or considering a used vehicle, understanding these reliability trends can save you thousands of dollars and countless headaches down the road.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nWorking Americans will soon see a sizable financial boost — all thanks to changes tied to President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nSpeaking with a reporter in Pennsylvania on Dec. 10, Bessent said an estimated $100 billion to $150 billion in tax refunds could hit bank accounts in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nBessent said that Trump has fought harder than anyone for his signature initiatives in the One Big Beautiful Bill, pointing to provisions such as no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and auto deductibility (1).\n\n“The bill was passed in July. Working Americans didn’t change their withholding, so they’re going to be getting very large refunds in the first quarter. So I think we’re going to see $100 to $150 billion of refunds, which could be between $1,000 and $2,000 per household.”\n\nAfter that, once withholding levels adjust, workers could see what he described as a “real increase” in their wages.\n\nThe White House echoed that outlook. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the upcoming refund season is projected to be the largest on record.\n\n“Americans can also expect another boost to their bank accounts in the months ahead as 2026 tax refund season is upon us after the holidays and it's projected to be the largest ever,” Leavitt said during a Dec. 11 press briefing (2).\n\nFor many households, that raises an immediate question: What’s the smartest way to use a sudden cash infusion? Whether you’re thinking about shoring up your finances, preparing for uncertainty, or putting that extra money to work, here are a few ways Americans may consider investing their potential windfall.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has been a powerful engine of wealth creation. Trump has pointed to that strength, recently saying, “the only thing that’s really going up big? It’s the stock market and your 401(k)s (3).”\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 is up about 16% year to date and has gained roughly 86% over the past five years.\n\nOf course, consistently picking winning stocks isn’t easy. That’s why legendary investor Warren Buffett argues that most people don’t need to pick individual companies at all to benefit from the stock market’s long-term growth.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Friday indefinitely froze Russia’s assets in Europe to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can’t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.\n\nUsing a special procedure meant for economic emergencies, the EU blocked the assets until Russia gives up its war on Ukraine and compensates its neighbor for the heavy damage that it has inflicted for almost four years.\n\nEU Council President António Costa said European leaders had committed in October “to keep Russian assets immobilized until Russia ends its war of aggression against Ukraine and compensates for the damage caused. Today we delivered on that commitment.”\n\nIt’s a key step that will allow EU leaders to work out at a summit next week how to use the tens of billions of euros in Russian Central Bank assets to underwrite a huge loan to help Ukraine meet its financial and military needs over the next two years.\n\n“Next step: securing Ukraine’s financial needs for 2026–27,” added Costa, who will chair the Dec. 18 summit.\n\nThe move also prevents the assets, estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion), from being used in any negotiations to end the war without European approval.\n\nA 28-point plan drafted by U.S. and Russian envoys stipulated that the EU would release the frozen assets for use by Ukraine, Russia and the United States. That plan, which surfaced last month, was rejected by Ukraine and its backers in Europe.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the EU decision means that “no one will decide in place of the Europeans the use of these funds.”\n\nThe vast majority of the funds — around 193 billion euros ($225 billion) at the end of September — are held in Euroclear, a Belgian financial clearing house.\n\nThe money was frozen under sanctions that the EU imposed on Russia over the war it launched on Feb. 24, 2022, but these sanctions must be renewed every six months with the approval of all 27 member countries.\n\nHungary and Slovakia oppose providing more support to Ukraine, but Friday’s decision prevents them from blocking the sanctions rollover and make it easier to use the assets.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in Europe – said on social media that it means that “the rule of law in the European Union comes to an end, and Europe’s leaders are placing themselves above the rules.”\n\n“The European Commission is systematically raping European law. It is doing this in order to continue the war in Ukraine, a war that clearly isn’t winnable,” he wrote. He said that Hungary “will do everything in its power to restore a lawful order.”\n\nIn a letter to Costa, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that he would refuse to back any move that “would include covering Ukraine’s military expenses for the coming years.”\n\nHe warned “that the use of frozen Russian assets could directly jeopardize U.S. peace efforts, which directly count on the use of these resources for the reconstruction of Ukraine.”\n\nBut the commission argues that the war has imposed heavy costs by hiking energy prices and stunting economic growth in the EU, which has already provided nearly 200 billion euros ($235 billion) in support to Ukraine.\n\nBelgium, where Euroclear is based, is opposed to the “reparations loan” plan. It says that the plan “entails consequential economic, financial and legal risks,” and has called on other EU countries to share the risk.\n\nRussia’s Central Bank, meanwhile, said on Friday that it has filed a lawsuit in Moscow against Euroclear for damages it says were caused when Moscow was barred from managing the assets. Euroclear declined to comment.\n\nThe Belgian clearing house has around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) in Russia and it’s unclear what would happen to that money if the legal challenge or others like it succeed.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Central Bank also described wider EU plans to use Russian assets to aid Ukraine as “illegal, contrary to international law,” arguing that they violated “the principles of sovereign immunity of assets.”\n\nBut EU Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis brushed off the suit, saying that the decision is “legally robust,” and that he expects Russia “to continue to launch speculative legal proceedings to prevent the EU from upholding international law.”\n\nChris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. Consultancy, said that the timing of the court action is “clearly linked” to the EU’s intention to use the frozen assets.\n\n“The Russian Central Bank is making clear that it will respond with legal actions against all countries involved in the decision to take the Russian money,” he said.\n\nFriday's EU decision came hours after Germany summoned the Russian ambassador in Berlin following allegations of sabotage, disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks and interference in its elections.",

    "description": "A thick layer of more than 12 miles of rock may explain why Bermuda seems to float above the surrounding ocean.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nMove aside, Bermuda Triangle: The newest North Atlantic mystery lies beneath this enigmatic archipelago. Scientists have discovered a strange, 12.4-mile-thick (20 kilometers) rock layer below the oceanic crust under Bermuda. This level of thickness has never been seen in any other similar layer worldwide.\n\n\"Typically, you have the bottom of the oceanic crust and then it would be expected to be the mantle,\" said study lead author William Frazer, a seismologist at Carnegie Science in Washington D.C. \"But in Bermuda, there is this other layer that is emplaced beneath the crust, within the tectonic plate that Bermuda sits on.\"\n\nWhile the origin of this layer is not entirely clear, it may explain an ongoing mystery about Bermuda, Frazer told Live Science. The island sits on an oceanic swell, where the ocean crust is higher than its surroundings. But there is no evidence of any ongoing volcanic activity creating that swell — the island's last known volcanic eruption was 31 million years ago.\n\nThe discovery of the new giant \"structure\" suggests the last eruption may have injected mantle rock into the crust, where it froze in place, creating something like a raft that raises the ocean floor by about 1,640 feet (500 meters).\n\nBermuda has long had a reputation for mystery, largely because of the Bermuda Triangle, an area between the archipelago, Florida and Puerto Rico where a supposedly unusual number of ships and aircraft have gone missing. (This reputation, however, has been largely exaggerated.) The real mystery, though, is why the Bermuda oceanic swell exists.\n\nIsland chains such as Hawaii are thought to exist because of mantle hotspots, which are places in the mantle where hot material rises, creating volcanic activity. At the point where the hotspot meets the crust, the ocean floor often buoys up. But when tectonic movement slides the crust away from that hotspot, the oceanic swell typically subsides.\n\nBermuda's swell hasn't subsided, despite 31 million years of volcanic inactivity there, Frazer said. There is some debate over what's happening in the mantle beneath the island, but there are no eruptions happening at the surface.\n\nFrazer and study co-author Jeffrey Park, a professor of Earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, used recordings from a seismic station on Bermuda of distant large earthquakes around the world to get an image of Earth down to about 31 miles (50 km) below Bermuda. They examined places where the seismic waves from these quakes suddenly changed. This revealed the unusually thick layer of rock, which is less dense than the other rock around it.\n\nTheir findings were published Nov. 28 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n\n\"There is still this material that is left over from the days of active volcanism under Bermuda that is helping to potentially hold it up as this area of high relief in the Atlantic Ocean,\" Sarah Mazza, a geologist at Smith College in Massachusetts who was not involved in the work, told Live Science.\n\nMazza's own research into Bermuda's volcanic history found that the types of lavas there are low in the mineral silica, which is a sign that they come from rock high in carbon. Mazza's examination of variations in zinc molecules in samples from Bermuda, published in September in the journal Geology, found that this carbon comes from deep in the mantle. It was likely first pushed there when the supercontinent Pangea formed between 900 million and 300 million years ago, Mazza said. This is different from what is seen at hotspot-formed islands in the Pacific or Indian oceans, she added. This difference may be because the Atlantic, which opened up when Pangea split apart, is a young ocean compared to the Pacific or Indian oceans, which were at Pangea's edges.\n\n—Scientists find hidden 'hotspot' that helped create the Great Lakes before North America even existed\n\n— Mysterious 'blobs' in Earth's mantle are not what we thought, study claims\n\n— Extreme 'paradise' volcano in Costa Rica is like a piece of ancient Mars on our doorstep\n\n\"The fact that we are in an area that was previously the heart of the last supercontinent is, I think, part of the story of why this is unique,\" she said.\n\nFrazer is now examining other islands around the world to find out if there are any similar layers to the one found under Bermuda, or whether the archipelago is truly one of a kind.\n\n\"Understanding a place like Bermuda, which is an extreme location, is important to understand places that are less extreme,\" Frazer said, \"and gives us a sense of what are the more normal processes that happen on Earth and what are the more extreme processes that happen.\"",

    "fullText": "The alleged Charlie Kirk shooter, Tyler Robinson, appeared calm during his first in-person court hearing. However, lip-reading suggests he reflected darkly on the shooting and even referenced Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk.\n\nThe 22-year-old is said to have described his mental struggles behind bars, saying that he thinks about the shooting \"every day.\"\n\nTyler Robinson faces multiple severe charges, including aggravated murder. He surrendered after a search and allegedly confessed to the shooting of Charlie Kirk in messages to his roommate.\n\nRobinson, the 22-year-old accused of killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, appeared in court Thursday and was caught in an unsettling off-mic exchange in which he seemingly reflected on the fatal shooting.\n\nDuring his first in-person court appearance in Provo, Utah, Robinson appeared calm, even sharing brief laughs and smiles with his attorney. But, according to a lip-reading analysis by Lip Reader Limited, his private comments were far darker.\n\n\"I think about the shooting daily,\" Robinson appeared to tell his lawyer before the hearing began. \"Every morning … all the time.\"\n\nAccording to the lip reader, he then seemed to reference Erika Kirk, who is now raising the couple's two young children alone.\n\n\"So, he had a wife…,\" the suspected shooter said at the moment. Robinson also allegedly talked about his mental state behind bars, saying he has been \"smoking a lot\" and struggling with sleepless nights.\n\n\"It's driving me mental,\" he appeared to add, per the New York Post. \"I'm not good for anything.\"\n\n🚨BREAKING: Accused Killer of Charile Kirk appears in person for the FIRST TIME since turning himself in.\n\nIt's absolutely infuriating.

They told us that there was video footage from a local fast-food restaurant. They were very, very almost oversharing in the beginning.\"\n\nHe added: \"Now they've shut that tap off, and they're saying you can't even come to court and hear about what we're doing when most of it's probably procedural.\"\n\nRobinson surrendered to authorities after a statewide search. According to court documents, his parents recognized him from surveillance images released by police and convinced him to turn himself in.\n\nThe next day, Robinson, his parents, and a family friend arrived at the Washington County Sheriff's Office, where he was taken into custody.\n\nInvestigators say Robinson also confessed in messages to his roommate and romantic partner, described in documents as \"a biological male who was transitioning genders.\"\n\nAs reported by The Blast, in those texts, he allegedly wrote, \"I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out,\" hinting at what many believe was his motive.\n\nRobinson's mother told detectives her son had grown \"more political\" and increasingly \"pro-gay and trans-rights oriented\" over the past year.\n\nAs for Robinson's roommate and alleged trans partner, Lance Twiggs, their whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\nTwiggs faced heavy scrutiny in the wake of the killing of the right-wing influencer after it was reported that Robinson had messaged him about his actions and motive.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, the 22-year-old has initially cooperated with authorities; however, it's unclear if that still remains the case given his current AWOL status.\n\nTwiggs has also not publicly said a word about the murder of Kirk and has not addressed the media since the shooting incident rocked the world.",

    "fullText": "Diamond Aircraft has officially delivered the first newly produced European-built DA20i Katana since restarting production of the line earlier this year. The aircraft was handed over to Aviation Academy Austria (AAA) during a ceremony at Diamond's headquarters in Wiener Neustadt on November 28.\n\nThis delivery marks a significant step for the Austrian manufacturer, which announced in October that it was resuming European production of the two-seat trainer after a hiatus of more than a decade. While the DA20-C1 has remained in continuous production at Diamond's Canadian facility for the North American market, the European return was driven by renewed demand from flight schools and private owners across the continent seeking a modern, fuel-efficient primary trainer.\n\nThe newly delivered aircraft is the first of two DA20i Katanas AAA ordered, with the second scheduled to arrive in early 2026. The academy, a longtime operator of Diamond aircraft, already maintains a fleet that includes seven older DA20i models, four DA40 NGs, and two DA42 NG-VI twins.\n\n\"We are thrilled to welcome the new DA20i Katana into our fleet,\" said Oliver Karall, CEO of Aviation Academy Austria. \"This aircraft perfectly aligns with our mission to provide state-of-the-art training solutions. Its combination of proven design and cutting-edge technology will allow our students to experience the very best in modern flight training.\"\n\nThe revitalized European DA20i distinguishes itself from its predecessors through significant avionics and powerplant upgrades. The new model is powered by the Rotax 912 iSc3 Sport engine, a shift from the Continental IO-240-B32B found in its Canadian-built C1 counterpart.\n\nInside, the cockpit has been modernized with a Garmin G500 TXi glass flight deck, replacing legacy instrumentation to offer students a touchscreen interface that better prepares them for advanced avionics platforms.\n\n\"Relaunching production of the DA20i Katana-and now delivering the first unit in Europe-marks another exciting chapter for Diamond Aircraft and our customers,\" said Jane Wang, director of sales and marketing at Diamond Aircraft Austria. \"The DA20i blends tradition with innovation, making it an ideal choice for flight schools like AAA that are committed to shaping the next generation of pilots.\"\n\nThe post Diamond Aircraft Hands Over First European-Built DA20 Since Restarting Production appeared first on Plane & Pilot.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — A senior Kremlin official said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n\nThe remarks by Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov underscore Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian units have recaptured several settlements and neighborhoods near the city of Kupiansk in the northeastern Kharkiv region, following a monthslong operation aimed at reversing Russian advances there.\n\nKupiansk has in recent months been one of the most closely contested sectors of the around 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, and the claimed Ukrainian progress of around 40 sq. km. (15 sq. miles) would be a setback for Russia.\n\nLess than two months ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Ukrainian troops in Kupiansk were surrounded and offered to negotiate their surrender. He said a media visit to the area would prove it. Putin has sought to portray Russia as negotiating from a position of strength in the war.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s office said he would host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations. Afterward, numerous European heads of state and government, as well as the leaders of the European Union and NATO, will join the meeting, a statement said.\n\nMoscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine’s forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov also said in comments published Friday in Russian business daily Kommersant.\n\nHe told Kommersant “it’s entirely possible that there won’t be any troops (in the Donbas), either Russian or Ukrainian” in a postwar scenario. But he said that “there will be the National Guard, our police, everything necessary to maintain order and organize life.”\n\nFor months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia’s war and grows increasingly exasperated by delays. The search for possible compromises has run into a major obstacle over who keeps Ukrainian territory that Russian forces have occupied so far.\n\nSince Moscow’s 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea and the seizure of territory in the east by Russia-backed separatists later that year, as well as land taken after the full-blown invasion was launched on Feb. 24, 2022, Russia has captured about 20% of its neighbor.\n\nUkraine says its constitution doesn’t allow it to surrender land. Russia, which illegally annexed Donetsk and three other regions illegally in 2022, says the same. Ushakov said that “no matter what the outcome (of peace talks), this territory (the Donbas) is Russian Federation territory.”\n\nOn Thursday, Trump compared the negotiations to a very complex real estate deal. He said that he wants to see more progress in talks before sending envoys to possible meetings with European leaders over the weekend.\n\nIn October, Trump said the Donbas region will have to be \"cut up\" to end the war.\n\nIn recent months, Russia’s army has made a determined push to gain control of all parts of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, which together make up the valuable Donbas region.\n\nIts slow slog across the Ukrainian countryside, using its significant advantage in troop numbers in a corrosive war of attrition, has been costly in terms of casualties and losses of armor. Although outnumbered, Ukrainian defenders have held firm in many areas and counterattacked in others.\n\nUkrainian forces said Friday that they had advanced around Kupiansk. They gradually cut off Russian supply routes into the city, starting on Sept. 22, and regained control of the villages of Kindrashivka and Radkivka, as well as several northern districts of the city, according to a statement by Ukrainian National Guard’s Khartia Corps posted on Facebook.\n\nFighting is ongoing in central Kupiansk, where more than 200 Russian soldiers are encircled, the statement said.\n\nZelenskyy posted a video of himself standing on the road into Kupiansk on Friday. Explosions could be heard in the background as he spoke.\n\n“Today, it is critically important to achieve results on the battlefield so that Ukraine can achieve results in diplomacy,” Zelenskyy said in the video, praising his troops on Ukraine’s Ground Forces Day.\n\nRussian officials made no immediate comment, and the Ukrainians statements couldn't be independently verified.\n\nUkraine also has developed its long-range strike capabilities using domestically produced weapons to disrupt Russia's war machine.\n\nIts Special Operations Forces, or SSO, said Friday that an operation in the Caspian Sea struck two Russian vessels carrying military equipment and arms.\n\nThe ships named Kompozitor Rakhmaninov and Askar-Saridzha are under U.S. sanctions for transporting arms between Russia and Iran, the SSO said in a statement on social media. It didn't say what weapons it used in its attack.\n\nA Ukrainian drone attack wounded seven people, including a child, in the Russian city of Tver, acting Gov. Vitaly Korolev said Friday. Falling drone debris struck an apartment building in the city, which lies northwest of Moscow, Korolev said.\n\nRussia’s air defenses destroyed 90 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Defense Ministry said.\n\nRussian drones struck a residential area of Pavlohrad, in Ukraine’s central Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding four others, the head of the local military administration, Vladyslav Haivanenko, wrote on the Telegram messaging channel on Friday.\n\nUkraine’s southern Odesa region came under a large-scale drone attack overnight, according to regional chief Oleh Kiper. The attack damaged energy infrastructure, he said. More than 90,000 people were without electricity on Friday morning, Deputy Energy Minister Roman Andarak said.\n\nUkraine’s air force said that Russia launched 80 drones across the country during the night.\n\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.
